I am pleased to introduce the sixth edition of the Uganda Economic Update series. Following the structure of earlier editions, the Sixth Economic&#13;
Update discusses recent macroeconomic developments, as well as a special topic â&#128;&#147; â&#128;&#156;Can Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s land support its prosperity drive?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Over the past year, Uganda grew above five percent, continuing the modest recovery started the previous year and benefitting from a stable&#13;
macro environment characterized by low inflation and modest interest rates, as well as favorable weather. The authorities continue to pursue&#13;
an ambitious public investment program meant to remove the countryâ&#128;&#153;s long standing deficiencies in physical infrastructure and to prepare&#13;
for the long-awaited extraction of oil. Near term economic growth is glazed with many uncertainties, including from external shocks and from&#13;
uncertainties and speculation related to upcoming national elections. Indeed, the Uganda shilling has recently depreciated heavily, helping the&#13;
economy to adjust to the shocks, but also generating inflationary pressures that have to be managed. Beyond 2016, the Government will have to&#13;
implement its ambitious investment program and raise more domestic revenues to ensure debt and fiscal sustainability, and to avoid crowding&#13;
out the domestic private investment.&#13;
&#13;
From a longer term perspective, Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance has been less stellar, compared to what the country was able to achieve in the&#13;
1990s and the first decade of the 2000s. Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s deceleration in the rate of economic growth can primarily be explained by the failure to achieve&#13;
productivity improvements. Productivity improvements would drive long-term growth and make the country more resilient to exogenous shocks.&#13;
Uganda is already making the right choices to address the key binding constraints in infrastructure and to build human capital. Alongside this,&#13;
another fundamental factor of production that must be managed appropriately to raise productivity and promote shared prosperity is land.&#13;
&#13;
Land is a finite asset and as population increases, land becomes scarcer and density increases. Yet, as demonstrated by many prospering countries&#13;
around the world, land can be managed appropriately to generate rapid and sustainable growth, even in the context of high population densities.&#13;
Good management of land use is fundamental to agricultural transformation and urbanization, two critical processes that could enable the&#13;
country to raise its level of productivity&#13;
&#13;
Making Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s land a more productive asset is a big challenge. The vested interests, suspicion, and fear of disruption to livelihoods, sensitivities&#13;
related to the location of investment projects and the resulting perverse incentives to local governments, can fuel activism against any form&#13;
of land reforms. But the land disputes and conflicts of today are clear indicators of the need for a better process. Ugandan policy makers must&#13;
formulate and implement smart policies to ensure that land becomes a more productive asset that facilitates positive economic transformation&#13;
and diversification. Such policies should aim to: (i) secure land tenure and reduce the rate of occurrence of conflicts and disputes caused by&#13;
overlapping rights; (ii) promote the healthy development of rental markets for land; and (iii) strengthen the capacities of institutions responsible&#13;
for land management administration.&#13;
&#13;
I hope that this update will inform the debate on land policy in Uganda, and motivate a comprehensive set of actions so that the countryâ&#128;&#153;s land will&#13;
facilitate much needed positive transformation and diversification of the economic base.&#13;

&#13;
Over the past twenty years, Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s population density has been increasing rapidly,&#13;
placing significant pressure on the use of land. Uganda now has a population density of&#13;
194 persons per square kilometer of arable land, compared to 80 in Kenya and 116 in Ghana.&#13;
At present, the majority of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s population still lives in rural areas, where the main source&#13;
of livelihood is agriculture. However, the proportion of the population living in urban areas has&#13;
increased significantly and will continue to increase into the future, with urban centers being&#13;
the main driver of economic growth and transformation into higher value added activities. The&#13;
highest rates of growth in population density are recorded in Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s central region.&#13;
&#13;
Increasing population density can support accelerated economic growth, if appropriately&#13;
managed through the implementation of systems to promote efficient land use. However,&#13;
in Uganda, despite the increasing population density, it has remained difficult to facilitate the&#13;
transformation of land use to enable the achievement of higher levels of productivity. One&#13;
of the main causes of this is the difficulties involved in transferring ownership of land from&#13;
one entity to another. On the one hand, the Government has failed to address the issue of&#13;
overlapping and conflicting land rights mainly in the central region and the lack of effective&#13;
institutions capable of managing land transactions. On the other hand, land markets are either&#13;
weak, non-existent, or do not facilitate the transfer of land at the appropriate price.&#13;
&#13;
With these failures, land is failing to optimally support the transformation process in&#13;
both rural and urban areas. Land transactions are often highly speculative, especially in&#13;
urban areas and in areas with significant public infrastructure developments. In the rural areas,&#13;
a large proportion of land transfers involve exploitative transactions, due to lack of information&#13;
or unequal power relations between buyers and sellers, especially in post-conflict regions and&#13;
in regions with significant oil or other mineral resources. Land rental markets have failed to&#13;
develop in a healthy and constructive fashion due to tensions between landlords and tenants&#13;
arising from overlapping rights and conflicting interests, especially on mailo land. All these&#13;
factors have contributed to an increase in the rate of occurrence of conflicts and disputes. The&#13;
result has been increased difficulty in transferring land from one owner to another or from one&#13;
type of economic activity to another.                                                                increasing population&#13;
It is essential that Uganda changes the manner in which it manages its land if the&#13;
                                                                                                     density can support&#13;
majority of its population is to achieve a higher level of prosperity through the healthy            accelerated economic&#13;
transformation of the agricultural sector and a shift towards higher value, more productive&#13;
economic activities more generally. In addition, more efficient land use will drive equitable&#13;
                                                                                                     growth, if appropriately&#13;
economic growth, with the process of urbanization resulting in functionality in the form of          managed through the&#13;
descent housing for urban dwellers; connectivity without congestion; and an improvement in&#13;
the quality of infrastructure. Development experiences across the world, especially in countries&#13;
                                                                                                     implementation of&#13;
with significant densely populated areas, such as China and India, indicate that when land           systems to promote&#13;
rights became secure and more readily transferable, more flexible land use opened the&#13;
gateway to positive economic transformation. More generally, transformation of land use is a&#13;
                                                                                                     efficient land use&#13;
key characteristic of economic transformation, with a trend towards an increasing proportion&#13;
of the land being used for higher productivity activities and towards an increasing proportion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                            ix&#13;
&amp;#12;of the labor force moving away from low productivity activities in subsistence agriculture. Within rural areas, economic activity would remain fairly&#13;
widely distributed, with productivity differences determined by soil fertility, climate and access to technology and market infrastructure. In urban&#13;
areas, the level of economic development is determined by the extent to which land is adaptable to changing market demand. In this context,&#13;
Uganda can learn from global patterns of development.&#13;
&#13;
Through the formulation and implementation of smart policies, Uganda can ensure that its land serves as a more productive asset that&#13;
facilitates positive transformation and a diversification of the economic base. The achievement of these goals will require a comprehensive&#13;
set of actions that will promote security of land tenure and reduce the rate of occurrence of conflicts and disputes caused by overlapping rights;&#13;
promote the healthy development of rental markets for land; and strengthen the capacities of institutions responsible for the management of land&#13;
administration. Failure to unlock the potential of land may result in a deceleration of growth and lack of progress towards prosperity. In addition,&#13;
rather than driving equitable economic growth, the process of urbanization will result in dysfunctionality in the form of the proliferation of slums;&#13;
increased congestion; and a deterioration in the quality of, or a failure to develop, infrastructure due to an escalation in the costs of construction&#13;
and payment of compensation. Implementation of relevant up to date laws and policies has to be accelerated to make land in Uganda genuinely&#13;
secure, transferable, marketable and supportive of economic development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Part 1: State of the Economy&#13;
&#13;
Since the national elections (including presidential and parliamentary) of 2011, the Ugandan economy has recovered to a significant&#13;
extent, but has not been able to come close to realizing the high levels of growth that it had recorded over recent decades. During FY&#13;
2014/15, the Ugandan economy grew at the rate of five percent per annum, with this growth driven by an acceleration in public and&#13;
private investments. During this year, the value of public investments reached the equivalent of 6.3 percent of GDP. While this was lower than&#13;
the targeted level of 8.6 percent of GDP-, it was 0.7 percentage points higher than the figure of 5.6 percent recorded in FY 2013/14. The total value&#13;
of private investments also increased significantly during FY 2014/15, largely due to the increased availability of credit. This also compensated for&#13;
the declining contribution of net exports resulting from a combination of lower regional and global demand for Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s products and the high&#13;
level of demand for imports to support construction. However, for the fifth consecutive year, Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s overall rate of growth remained below that&#13;
achieved by Tanzania, Kenya and Rwanda, as the former decelerated.&#13;
&#13;
While the services sector continues to contribute the largest proportion to overall GDP growth, the recent recovery of the manufacturing&#13;
and agriculture sectors was nonetheless impressive. The services sector grew at a rate of 4.6 percent, with the financial and insurance services&#13;
sub-sector being the most significant contributor to this growth. Starting from a low base, the industrial sector made only a minimal contribution&#13;
to overall GDP, despite the fact that it recorded an impressive rate of growth of 6.4 percent. This growth was supported by the strong recovery of&#13;
the manufacturing sub-sector, following its contraction three years ago, when it was affected by power shortages and higher electricity prices;&#13;
financing constraints resulting from tight liquidity; and decreases in&#13;
demand from global markets. These factors recently improved with the&#13;
commissioning of Bujagali power dam in 2012, allowing firms to access&#13;
electricity with less disruptions, while the cost of credit gradually            through the formulation and&#13;
declined as banks gradually reduced their interest rates between FY&#13;
                                                                                 implementation of smart&#13;
2012/13 and FY 2014/15. The rate of growth of the agricultural sector&#13;
stood at 4.4 percent in FY 2014/15, significantly higher than the figure of      policies, Uganda can ensure&#13;
1.5 percent recorded in the previous year, driven by strong recovery of&#13;
                                                                                 that its land serves as a more&#13;
cash crops and fish exports. Construction did not achieve the expected&#13;
levels of performance, with this sectorâ&#128;&#153;s rate of growth declining to            productive asset that facilitates&#13;
2.0 percent, from 5.7 percent in FY 2013/14, and from 10 percent in FY&#13;
                                                                                 positive transformation and a&#13;
2012/13.&#13;
                                                                                 diversification of the economic&#13;
The low rate of inflation and neutral monetary policy made a&#13;
positive contribution on economic activity during FY 2014/15.&#13;
                                                                                 base&#13;
The rate of inflation averaged 2.4 percent during FY 2014/15, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
x&#13;
&amp;#12;this low rate partially resulting from increased domestic supply and reduced external shocks&#13;
throughout most of the year. Food inflation was negative for most of the year, with agriculture&#13;
output increasing as a result of good weather. Non-food inflation was also subdued on account&#13;
of the decline in the cost of imports, particularly due to the decline in the global cost of oil, even&#13;
though the spillover effect on domestic prices occurred only gradually. In response to the low&#13;
rate of inflation, the Central Bank implemented a neutral monetary policy throughout most of&#13;
the year. This resulted in an increase in the availability of credit to private sector, with the total&#13;
value of this credit growing at an average rate of 15 percent per annum for the 10 months of FY&#13;
2014/15, compared to eight percent in the same period during FY 2013/14.&#13;
&#13;
However, the positive contribution to growth is likely to be negated as inflationary&#13;
pressures increase and policy is tightened. Since April 2015, inflationary pressures have&#13;
increased, with the most significant factor being the fast depreciation of the exchange rate.&#13;
The Central Bankâ&#128;&#153;s response was to raise its policy rate aggressively to the level of 16 percent&#13;
per annum by August 2015 and to impede access to funds by commercial banks by increasing&#13;
the margin between the Central Bank Rate and rediscount rate from three to four percentage&#13;
points. This measure triggered an increase in interest rates on lending, which together with the&#13;
strong growth of government borrowing, may curtail further growth in private sector credit.&#13;
&#13;
The external position weakened due to the combined impact of a deterioration in the&#13;
values of flows into the current and financial accounts during the FY 2014/15. While the&#13;
value of exports to regional markets grew at a slower rate than in previous years due to the&#13;
decline in demand from South Sudan, the total value of all exports of goods increased by 3.1&#13;
percent, mainly as a result of a growth in the value of non-traditional exports, including metal&#13;
and plastic products, bottled water, and rice. This could have been helped by the depreciating&#13;
shilling. The traditional export commodities, such as coffee and tea, which still accounted&#13;
for 30 percent of the total value of exported goods, did not perform well due to weak global&#13;
demand resulting from the relapses in the global economy. However, with the total value of&#13;
imports of merchandise goods declining to the equivalent of 18.4 percent of GDP, the trade&#13;
balance improved to a value equivalent to 5.7 percent of GDP. The modest improvement to the&#13;
trade account was more than fully offset by increases in net outflows for services and income&#13;
and the decline in the value of transfers, all of which contributed to an increased deficit on the&#13;
current account, from a value equivalent to 7.9 percent of GDP in FY 2013/14 to 8.8 percent in&#13;
FY 2014/15.&#13;
&#13;
In the same period, the financial account deteriorated due to a decline in the value of&#13;
foreign direct investment of 3.2 percent to US$ 1,186 million. Reserves declined too. In                 since April 2015,&#13;
response to the weaker external position, the local currency has steadily depreciated in value&#13;
                                                                                                         inflationary&#13;
since January 2014. Thus, in FY 2014/15, the value of the shilling declined by 24 percent relative&#13;
to the dollar, and by 17 percent in real terms. Overall, this depreciation was faster than that of       pressures have&#13;
the Kenyan and Tanzanian currencies during this period. The depreciation continued into the&#13;
                                                                                                         increased, with the&#13;
first two months of FY 2015/16, with the exchange rate standing at Shs 3500 to the dollar, which&#13;
means that the currency has lost 35 percent of its value since August 2014. The shilling also            most significant&#13;
suffered due to increases in the value of the US dollar as the American economy strengthened&#13;
                                                                                                         factor being the fast&#13;
and due to the uncertainties and speculative tendencies in anticipation of the forthcoming&#13;
election activities.                                                                                     depreciation of the&#13;
In FY 2014/15, the collection of domestic revenues was slightly above target, easing&#13;
                                                                                                         exchange rate&#13;
pressure on fiscal operations. However, for the third consecutive year, the under-execution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                 xi&#13;
&amp;#12;of the budget continued to undermine fiscal objectives. The Government estimated that during FY 2014/15, it had collected tax revenue to a value&#13;
equivalent to 12.9 percent of GDP, which is slightly above the target of 12.7 percent for the year. In particular, good performance was recorded in&#13;
the area of the collection of corporate and withholding taxes, which are direct domestic taxes. The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s total expenditures were lower&#13;
than the budgeted target by the equivalent of 2.1 percentage points of GDP. A major factor in this was the slow progress in the construction of the&#13;
Karuma dam, which accounted for 25 percent of the approved development budget (excluding donor projects), with negotiations for more than&#13;
80 percent of funding for the project not reaching a conclusion during the year. Consequently, the fiscal deficit reached a level equivalent to 4.5&#13;
percent of GDP, almost two percentage points lower than planned, but with more than 75 percent being financed through domestic borrowing.&#13;
&#13;
Establishment of supplementary budgets undermined the credibility of the budget in the past. However, during FY 2014/15, this instrument&#13;
was mainly used to reallocate resources saved during a clean-up of the government pay and pension system to ensure the validity of the government&#13;
payroll. The savings from this clean-up exercise enabled the Government to establish a supplementary budget amounting to a value of Shs 1,122.4&#13;
billion, and equivalent to about seven percent of the total value of the approved budget. The bulk of this supplementary budget was indeed a&#13;
reallocation to pay pensions and gratuity arrears and to outstanding wages after the payroll clean-up.&#13;
&#13;
Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s economic outlook continues to be characterized by a high level of uncertainty in the context of the upcoming elections in 2016&#13;
and with the pressure on the local currency that may be exacerbated by the devaluation of the Chinese currency in August. With little room&#13;
to increase its level of revenue collection to offset increased expenditure, which is expected to increase beyond the 2010-11 levels, the authorities&#13;
will have to overcome constraints to the management of public investments to ensure that the expansive fiscal policy adopted for FY 2015/16&#13;
stimulates growth rather than contributing to instability.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank forecasts that during FY 2015/16, the Ugandan economy will grow at a rate between five and 5.5 percent, with uncertainties&#13;
created by the upcoming elections; the need to tighten monetary policy in response to increasing inflationary pressures; and a weak&#13;
external position acting as possible constraints on the growth momentum. The ongoing recovery will depend heavily on the achievement of&#13;
macro-stability, with the most significant factor being the achievement of a lower, less volatile rate of inflation. With the increase in inflationary&#13;
pressures recently, the tightening of monetary policy may inevitably need to be intensified, possibly resulting in a higher cost of credit and a&#13;
decrease in the availability of credit to the private sector. Under these circumstances, sound fiscal policy will remain critical to attaining the growth&#13;
forecast. With the bulk of the increase in expenditure during the year intended to finance huge investment projects that have been shifted from one&#13;
year to the next over the past three years, both the conclusion of financing arrangements for these projects and their accelerated implementation&#13;
will be critically important.&#13;
&#13;
Looking to the medium term future, investments intended to address constraints on growth, particularly constraints related to&#13;
energy supply and transport infrastructure, should revive private investments; boost agricultural production; and energize the light&#13;
manufacturing sector. The new oil economy will dramatically change Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s economic outlook, enabling significantly increased investment&#13;
in productive infrastructure. In future years, when production facilities become active, actual oil revenues could double the value of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
current level of fiscal revenues. The experience of other countries shows that the oil development preparation phase is often characterized by&#13;
a high level of foreign investment that significantly impact economic&#13;
performance, at least in the regions implementing those investments.&#13;
This is another area where the implementation of the Public Finance&#13;
Management Act 2015 will play a critically important role in developing&#13;
                                                                                  the new oil economy will&#13;
institutions that ensure transparency and the prudent management                  dramatically change Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
of revenue to facilitate the optimal utilization of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s oil&#13;
resources. The increase in expenditure required to finance investment&#13;
                                                                                  economic outlook; when&#13;
in infrastructure will result in an expansion of the fiscal deficit, which is     production facilities become&#13;
expected to decline by about 2020.&#13;
                                                                                  active, actual oil revenues could&#13;
The downside risks are significant, particularly in the area of fiscal            double the value of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
management. Closely related to pressures resulting from the elections,&#13;
parliament has been considering to create new administrative units                current level of fiscal revenues&#13;
including sub-counties, municipalities, and districts. In addition, poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
xii&#13;
&amp;#12;performance in the area of domestic revenue mobilization; and the uncertainty regarding&#13;
the date of commencement of oil production and the subsequent flow of revenues, there&#13;
is a considerable degree of risk associated with the financing of investments in the country.&#13;
These are exacerbated by a failure to release, sequence and plan infrastructure investments&#13;
in accordance with absorptive capacity and the availability of financing. Furthermore, a more&#13;
expansionary fiscal policy will also result in higher levels of debt, the sustainability of which&#13;
largely depends on whether the public investment program generates a strong private sector&#13;
response that in turn results in increased growth and increased domestic revenues. Without&#13;
this response, higher deficits may raise the cost of borrowing for the private sector and increase&#13;
the build-up of debt, exacerbating debt financing risk.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to these internal risks, Uganda faces a number of exogenous risks. While low&#13;
oil prices are beneficial to Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s balance of trade, it has increased the risk to investment&#13;
plans in the oil sector. If oil prices take longer to recover from the current levels of US $ 40 per&#13;
barrel, compared to the estimated break-even price of US $ 60 per barrel for its production&#13;
in Uganda, it may even require different choices with respect to the phasing of refinery and&#13;
pipeline investments. A prolonged low economic activity in China will make Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s imports&#13;
from there cheaper, but its impact on global demand could increase volatility in global&#13;
commodity prices, including oil prices, which may further reduce the value of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
exports; exacerbate pressure on the currency; and increase inflationary pressures. All of these&#13;
factors may contribute to a slowdown in economic growth. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s trade prospects are&#13;
also influenced by the security situation in neighboring countries, Burundi, the Democratic&#13;
Republic of Congo (DRC), and South Sudan, although the recently signed peace accord&#13;
between Government of South Sudan and the rebel factions, may reduce the threat of conflict&#13;
in that part of the region.&#13;
&#13;
Beyond these risks, Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s growth and development is constrained by the low levels&#13;
of productivity of both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors; inappropriate urban&#13;
development; the slow development of infrastructure; and the limited availability of credit.&#13;
This type of growth can neither shield the economy from shocks nor accelerate its rate of&#13;
economic growth to higher levels of prosperity. Secure property rights and better functioning&#13;
land markets can generate productivity improvements in agriculture, allow better urban&#13;
development and overall infrastructure investments, while improving access to finance and&#13;
providing a platform for mobilizing more domestic revenues. The second section of this update&#13;
addresses these issues in greater detail.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Part 2: Proper land administration and management:&#13;
A Key to productivity improvements, but how should it be done?                                         while low oil prices are&#13;
                                                                                                       beneficial to Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Failure to register a greater proportion of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s land and the weak institutional&#13;
capacities of land administration agencies have resulted in illiquid land markets and                  balance of trade, it has&#13;
have acted as constraints on the development of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s financial systems, both&#13;
                                                                                                       increased the risk to&#13;
of which factors are negatively affecting the countryâ&#128;&#153;s ability to transform its agricultural&#13;
sector; to build efficient cities; and to achieve higher levels of productivity more generally.        investment plans in the&#13;
As can be seen from the experience of other countries, the ability of Uganda to leverage land&#13;
                                                                                                       oil sector.&#13;
use to promote positive economic development will depend greatly on the level of security of&#13;
land tenure and the ease with which land rights can be transferred between different entities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                              xiii&#13;
&amp;#12;including individuals, households and firms and government, with systems in place to ensure that government acquisitions are conducted in the&#13;
public interest and with fair and full compensation. At present, approximately 20 percent of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s land is registered as mailo, freehold and&#13;
leasehold tenure, which is higher than the average level of 10 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. Despite these better than average figures,&#13;
security of land tenure in Uganda remains weak due to unclear property rights and a high rate of occurrence of disputes and conflicts. A relatively&#13;
small proportion of land in Uganda is marketable, which limits the flexibility of its usage. Even where they exist, land markets are highly segmented&#13;
and inefficient. According to the Uganda National Household Survey of 2005/06, while approximately 60 percent of households own land, only 39&#13;
percent of individually-owned rural land was purchased. Because of the lack of clearly defined land rights, 37 percent of such land cannot be sold;&#13;
34 percent cannot be rented; and 44 percent of land cannot be used as security for a loan.&#13;
&#13;
With this state of affairs, both rural and urban transformation has been constrained. Land disputes are estimated to reduce the level of&#13;
agricultural growth in Uganda by between 5 and 11 percentage points, with the availability of secure land being a significant factor in&#13;
farmersâ&#128;&#153; decisions to move from subsistence into commercial agriculture. On the other hand, the limited fluidity of land markets, compounded&#13;
by the lack of sufficient land for formal development projects and the lack of enabling site and building standards, has contributed to the low&#13;
economic density of most urban centers in Uganda. At present, such centers are characterized by inefficient horizontal expansion, rather than&#13;
more efficient vertical expansion achieved through the construction of high-rise, multipurpose buildings. Moreover, urban authorities do not have&#13;
access to the land required for the necessary public works and social infrastructure and have to purchase it at exorbitant cost. This is a result of&#13;
the high compensation rates involved in the acquisition of such land due to highly inflated land prices caused by the lack of available alternative&#13;
investment opportunities and the need in many cases to pay compensation not only to registered land owners, but also to bona fide occupants.&#13;
The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s infrastructure program has also faced major challenges related to compensation and inflated costs on account of irregular&#13;
transactions and land acquisition.&#13;
&#13;
Ugandan policy makers must formulate and implement smart policies that will ensure that land serves as a more productive asset that&#13;
facilitates positive transformation and a diversification of the economic base. These policies should aim to: (i) promote the security of land&#13;
tenure and reduce the rate of occurrence of conflicts and disputes caused by overlapping rights; (ii) promote the healthy development of rental&#13;
markets for land; and (iii) strengthen the capacities of institutions responsible for management of land administration. Economically, such reforms&#13;
would promote the development of a virtuous circle, as they would facilitate the achievement of higher levels of productivity, which in turn would&#13;
enable the Government to increase the value of collected revenues, which in turn would provide it with the means to acquire additional land to&#13;
promote further development and to compensate those who may have been negatively impacted by the process of economic transformation.&#13;
However, vested interests, suspicion, fear of disruption to livelihoods, activism against any form of land reforms, sensitivities related to the location&#13;
of investment projects and the resulting perverse incentives to local governments, all need to be taken into account if the tensions that may arise&#13;
as a result of land reforms are to be managed appropriately.&#13;
&#13;
The Ugandan authorities have made important strides in creating a policy framework and devising initiatives geared towards achieving&#13;
a smart policy framework for land management. In addition to the National Land Use Policy of 2007 and the National Land Policy of 2013,&#13;
the Government of Uganda is in the advanced stages of developing the complementary National Resettlement Policy, National Urban Policy and&#13;
a National Housing Policy. The Government has also embarked on a&#13;
process of rehabilitating and modernizing land institutions, including&#13;
through the computerization of the land information systems.&#13;
Consistent with the Land Act 1998, the Uganda Land Commission                     the new oil economy will&#13;
operates a Land Fund, the objective of which is to provide funds                  dramatically change Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
to bona fide and lawful occupants to buy out land lords and also to&#13;
finance resettlement of those made landless by disasters. There                   economic outlook; when&#13;
are also initiatives to organize communal land owners in Northern                 production facilities become&#13;
Uganda into legal entities and to register their land, while also&#13;
accelerating the systematic registration of individual land rights.               active, actual oil revenues could&#13;
Implementation remains crucial in order to ensure that land in Uganda             double the value of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
is secure, transferable, marketable, and plays a constructive role in the&#13;
achievement of economic development. Drawing on global lessons,                   current level of fiscal revenues&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
xiv&#13;
&amp;#12;characteristics as Uganda, this report recommends four points of action to hasten the process&#13;
of implementation. The first two of these actions build on initiatives that have already been&#13;
commenced by the Government, while the other two are intended to bridge unaddressed gaps.&#13;
&#13;
The four points of action are:&#13;
&#13;
i.	   Accelerating the Systematic Registration of Land: The first point of action is to&#13;
      accelerate processes already in place to systematically register land to significantly&#13;
      increase the proportion of land that is registered, including land owned by individuals;&#13;
      communally-owned lands; and state-owned land.&#13;
&#13;
ii.	 Redesigning the Land Fund: The second point of action is to redesign the Land Fund&#13;
      to enhance its efficiency and equity. This will require the promotion of the principle and&#13;
      practice of land sharing between the mailo landlord and tenant (lawful and bona fide),&#13;
      with free negotiations between the two parties to enable one party to buy out the rights&#13;
      of the other.&#13;
&#13;
iii.	 Strengthening Institutions for Land Administration Management: The third point of&#13;
      action is to strengthen the institutions responsible for land administration management,&#13;
      including to: (i) improve dispute resolution systems to fill the institutional vacuum in areas&#13;
      where such capacities are particularly lacking, especially in northern Uganda and the&#13;
      Albertine region, by fully staffing zonal and district land offices; build competent formal&#13;
      institutions by providing adequate staff, budget and training to the judiciary throughout&#13;
      the country; and strengthen the Local Council Courts and their interface with traditional&#13;
      institutions; (ii) further strengthen land administration systems, including through the&#13;
      application of new technologies to improve documentation, information storage and&#13;
      retrieval, and valuation. The issue of valuation is particularly critical for urban areas, where a&#13;
      credible system for documenting and valuing land will go a long way towards streamlining&#13;
      transactions and eliminating speculation; and (iii) strengthen the management of local&#13;
      urban authoritiesâ&#128;&#153; finances to acquire land and pay for infrastructure improvements.&#13;
&#13;
iv.	 Reviewing Policy Commitments to Close Critical Gaps: The fourth point of action&#13;
      is to review and prioritize the many existing policy commitments to identify and close&#13;
      critical gaps. The key aim of this process should be to: (i) amend the laws to remove&#13;
      restrictions on rental markets on mailo and freehold land to improve landlord-tenant&#13;
      relations; (ii) create disincentives (including through the imposition of taxes) to discourage&#13;
      speculative holding of land unused for extended periods of time; (iii) clarify policies for          increasing population&#13;
      the use of urban land, including through the provision of incentives to promote vertical&#13;
      expansion and multi-purpose usage of structures to promote density and sustainable&#13;
                                                                                                           density can support&#13;
      urban development; (iv) adopt innovative instruments for land pooling, financing and                 accelerated economic&#13;
      development to achieve economies of scale and equitable urban land development;&#13;
      and (v) address the issue of expropriation and compensation, to promote the principle&#13;
                                                                                                           growth, if appropriately&#13;
      of fairness and equity. The current market-based practice normally underestimates the                managed through the&#13;
      value of future income from the investment for which the land is being acquired, and often&#13;
      does not provide payment for the movement of people into new areas of settlement and&#13;
                                                                                                           implementation of&#13;
      the restoration of livelihoods to at least the level that existed before the expropriation.          systems to promote&#13;
      This action also requires for the policy framework to strengthen regulations and the&#13;
      enforcement of those that already exist.&#13;
                                                                                                           efficient land use&#13;

The State of the Economy:&#13;
Ugandan in modest recovery, faces new&#13;
risks..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                            1&#13;
&amp;#12;    Supported by moderate inflationary pressures and a subsequent strengthening of bank lending to the&#13;
    private sector, the Ugandan economy grew at the rate of 5.0 percent during FY 2014/15, continuing on&#13;
    the path of moderate recovery that began in the previous year. Like it succeeded to create space for&#13;
    faster private sector credit growth during FY 2014/15, monetary policy has recently adopted a tighter&#13;
    stance aimed at ensuring that the rapidly depreciating local currency, and any increased spending&#13;
    pressures during the election year does not fuel inflation further. Fiscal policy has remained almost blunt&#13;
    as tax revenues collected remain less than 13 percent of GDP and the public investment program is not&#13;
    significantly executed for three consecutive years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    With the volatile external environment and uncertainties related to the upcoming national elections likely&#13;
    to constrain acceleration in private investments, the public sector will need to implement its investment&#13;
    program more effectively, in order for the country to sustain a positive economic growth trajectory in the&#13;
    near and medium term. This will involve fully implementing the Public Finance Management Act 2015&#13;
    and to â&#128;&#152;invest in the capacity to investâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    During FY 2015/16, the Ugandan economy is forecasted to grow at a rate in the range of 5 - 5.5 percent,&#13;
    with uncertainties created by the upcoming elections; the need to tighten monetary policy in response to&#13;
    increasing inflationary pressures; and a weak external position acting as possible constraints on growth.&#13;
    However, growth is expected to increase into the medium term as the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s infrastructure&#13;
    program, including for oil production, materializes and eventually realizes economy-wide efficiency and&#13;
    productivity improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    A number of downside risks, particularly those related to fiscal management and a volatile external&#13;
    environment threaten sustainability of high growth rates into the medium term. However, a more&#13;
    fundamental risk relates to inability of the Ugandan economy to raise productivity of both agricultural and&#13;
    non-agricultural sectors; and of rural and urban locations. Secure property rights and better functioning&#13;
    land markets and institutions can help land become a more productive factor of production and hence&#13;
    generate productivity improvements across the economy. It can also ensure that growth becomes more&#13;
    pro-poor as people currently with weak land rights benefit more from growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
&amp;#12;      1. Recent Economic&#13;
         Developments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
At the end of FY 2014/15, Uganda completed its first five-&#13;
year development plan and commenced on the second&#13;
of such plans. A series of five-year plans are intended to&#13;
facilitate the achievement of a vision for the economic&#13;
and social transformation of the country by 2040.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the period of the recently completed plan, Uganda embarked on a number of&#13;
projects intended both to address the infrastructure deficit and to prepare for the production&#13;
of oil. The commencement of the second five-year plan is taking place in the context of&#13;
the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections, which are held every five years.&#13;
According to this schedule, elections are planned to take place during the first quarter of 2016.&#13;
During the previous elections, held in 2011, a number of tensions in the area of economic&#13;
management arose. In the context of the upcoming elections, it is possible that similar&#13;
tensions will recur. In this context and that of a volatile external environment, economic&#13;
management will need to be delicately managed to sustain the efforts that have recently&#13;
begun to be implemented to address longer term structural issues. Such efforts remain vital&#13;
for the achievement of overall growth and economic development.&#13;
&#13;
Over the past five years, a series of internal and external shocks; slippages in fiscal&#13;
and monetary policies; disruptions to aid flows due to corruption cases, and a volatile&#13;
external environment, have affected Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s macroeconomic performance. From a                      the acceleration&#13;
peak of 9.8 percent in FY 2010/11, the rate of growth has declined steadily, reaching a low of&#13;
3.3 percent in FY 2012/13. However, as shocks abated and policy stabilized, the economy             in the rate of&#13;
begun to recover, growing by 4.6 percent during FY 2013/14. This acceleration in the rate of        growth has been&#13;
growth has been supported by a benign economic environment, characterized by low rates&#13;
of inflation, good harvests, and favorable global commodity prices. However, the high level&#13;
                                                                                                    supported by a&#13;
of volatility has negatively impacted living conditions of Ugandans. In addition, Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s          benign economic&#13;
economic growth must be viewed in the context of the rapid expansion in the size of its&#13;
                                                                                                    environment,&#13;
population. With a high rate of population growth, per capita income is estimated to have&#13;
grown by only 2.4 percent over the past five years, which is much slower than the rate of 5.2       characterized&#13;
percent achieved in the previous two decades. With these lower rates of growth, it may take at      by low rates of&#13;
least eight years for Uganda to achieve an increase in its average per capita income from the&#13;
current level of US$ 660 to US$ 1000, thus fulfilling its goal of achieving middle income status.   inflation, good&#13;
As has been emphasized in our earlier economic updates, the passive acceptance of low               harvests, and&#13;
rates of growth is not an option for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s policymakers. Rather, policymakers need to&#13;
actively address constraints on the achievement of higher rates of growth.&#13;
                                                                                                    favorable global&#13;

Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s economy is showing modest signs of recovery following                           positive business sentiments. By the end of the second quarter, the&#13;

With this modest recovery, Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s rate of growth was still                             boom resulting from the large public sector infrastructure program&#13;

period, even though the spillover effect on domestic prices occurred                         (headline) inflation rate increased to 4.9 percent, from the average&#13;

import of goods declined by one percentage point to reach the                               government in infrastructure, with these investments requiring the&#13;

  According to a private sector investment survey conducted by Bank of Uganda (2014), despite the declines in the value of FDI, these investments remain strong and are driven by&#13;

1.4 Slow pace of public investment results in lower fiscal deficit and a greater&#13;
proportion of the budget being utilized for recurrent expenditure&#13;
&#13;
Between FY 2011/12 and FY 2013/14, there has been a sustained                 increase in total expenditure of 25 percent in nominal terms. As a&#13;
effort to increase the relative proportion of the budget allocated            share of GDP, total expenditure was budgeted to increase from a&#13;
for capital expenditures, with this increased capital expenditure             value equivalent to 16.7 percent of GDP in FY 2013/14 to 21.5 percent&#13;
being intended to address the infrastructure deficit. However,                in FY 2014/15. Of this expenditure, 30 percent was to be allocated for&#13;
this goal has not yet been fully achieved. The shortfall in expenditure       the development of transport and energy infrastructure. Intended to&#13;
during this period amounted to a value equivalent to three                    develop social and human capital, the allocation to the education and&#13;
percentage points of GDP. This shortfall constrained an expansionist          health sectors constituted a large share of Government expenditure,&#13;
fiscal policy that had the potential to stimulate growth in the short         at 15 percent and 9 percent respectively. Domestic revenues were&#13;

commenced.                                                                    to 13.3 percent, as a result of the implementation of a series of tax&#13;

Similarly, in line with a policy to address the infrastructure                and to broaden the tax base. This increase in revenue would have&#13;

expansionary budget for FY 2014/15. This budget projected an                  grants from a value equivalent to 1.0 percent of GDP to that of 1.5&#13;

&amp;#12;percent anticipated in that year. Therefore, in the approved budget,                          At this level of performance, the value of collected revenues&#13;
the overall fiscal deficit was projected to increase from a value                             would have increased to a level equivalent to 12.9 percent of&#13;
equivalent to 3.8 percent of GDP in FY 2013/14 to 6.9 percent. This was                       GDP, which is slightly above the target of 12.7 percent for the year.&#13;
expected to be partially funded by external loans to a value equivalent                       In particular, good performance was recorded in the area of the&#13;

With the value of collected revenues coming closer to targeted                                taxes, mainly due to short falls in the collection of excise duty on beer&#13;
levels, the implementation of the FY 2014/15 budget was under                                 and on international telephone calls, with the latter being caused by&#13;
less pressure than in the previous two years. The collection of                               a reduction in taxes on regional international calls rates. This sluggish&#13;
domestic revenues exceeded target, after overcoming several months                            collection of revenues leaves Uganda far worse off than neighbouring&#13;

&amp;#12;As a result of under-execution in the public investment budget,                 to the financing arrangements, this resulted in targeted external&#13;
the fiscal deficit was lower than budgeted by a value equivalent                financing to a value equivalent to up to 1.5 percent of GDP not&#13;
to almost two percentage points of GDP. The overall deficit is                  materializing. The value of loans from domestic sources amounted&#13;
estimated to have reached a value equivalent to 4.5 percent of GDP.             to Shs 2.7 billion, which is a value equivalent to 3.4 percent of GDP.&#13;
This would be 1.9 percentage points lower than the approved budget              Hence, the value of these loans remained within the limits established&#13;

                     Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s economic outlook for the near future is&#13;
                     characterized by a high level of uncertainty, particularly&#13;
                     in the context of the upcoming national elections in 2016,&#13;
                     low international oil prices, and increasing pressure on&#13;
                     its currency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     In this context, the World Bank forecasts that the rate of growth of the Ugandan economy in&#13;
                     FY 2015/16 will be in the range of 5.0 to 5.5 percent. With contradictory developments during&#13;
                     the first quarter of the year and anticipated election activity, a modest increase in the rate of&#13;
                     growth of GDP should be expected to be achieved.&#13;
&#13;
                     The ongoing recovery will depend heavily on the achievement of macro-stability,&#13;
                     with the most significant factor being the achievement of a lower, less volatile rate of&#13;
                     inflation. With demonstrated limited success to increase its collection of revenue to offset&#13;
                     increased expenditure, there is an urgent need for the authorities to address constraints&#13;
                     to the management of public investments and thereby to ensure that the expansive fiscal&#13;
                     policy adopted for FY 2015/16 stimulates growth rather than contributes to instability. The&#13;
                     protracted depreciation in the value of the Ugandan shilling is consistent with the weak&#13;
                     external position and should improve Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness. However, it has resulted in&#13;
                     increased inflationary pressures. Even if international energy prices increase only gradually&#13;
 the protracted&#13;

 the value of the    poor rainfalls that may affect the supply of food to domestic markets. However, the tightening&#13;

 is consistent       shown by the impact of the increase in interest rates at the beginning of this year.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
      Box 1: Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s devaluation â&#128;&#147; Can Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s fortunes offset the misfortunes?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Chinese economy has significantly weakened over the past three years. This was a result of reduced industrial production, investment, retail&#13;
sales and export growth. In line with the changed fundamentals, on August 11, 2015, China devalued its currency, the Yuan, by 2 percent. This&#13;
decision by the Central Bank of China is expected to have some implications to other countries including those in Africa. For Uganda, there could&#13;
be three main channels, including trade, investment and debt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Trade channel: China has become an increasingly large source of imports of many consumer goods in Uganda. While only about 3&#13;
percent of its exports (including leather, coffee, fish and food products) go to China, Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s imports from China have gradually increased&#13;
representing about 13 percent of its total imports in the FY 2014/15. Products imported from China include among others light manufacturing&#13;
products, farm tools, textiles, pharmaceutical products, garments, and ceramics. It is worth to note that an additional 39 percent of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
imports, are sourced from Asia, including India, Japan, and Indonesia. The immediate effect of the recent devaluation of the Yuan could be an&#13;
improvement of the trade balance as the value of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s imports from China reduce as a results of lower price of these imports. Moreover,&#13;
Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s total import bill could eventually reduce further if other Asian countries directly or indirectly devalue their currencies in response to&#13;
the Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s currency devaluation. However, later, the cheaper imports could in fact outcompete Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s exports in other markets and offset&#13;
the improvement in Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s current account balance. Meanwhile, this current account deterioration could be offset by far reaching effects to&#13;
Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s economy through its impact on domestic activities, including retail trade, construction and other productive activities (manufacturing&#13;
and agriculture), due to favorable input prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The investment channel: While it does not appear among the top 10 sources of foreign direct investment in the country, China has gradually&#13;
increased its investment in Uganda over the past three years. According to the Uganda Investment Authority data, in 2013 FDI inflows from&#13;
advanced economies reached US$857.6 billion, accounting for 60.8 percent of global FDI outflows. This was mainly due to the growth in South-&#13;
to-South FDI flows mainly on account of investments from China, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Singapore and India into mining, manufacturing&#13;
and infrastructure development activities. A weaker Chinese economy and its neighbors, will mean that the recent impetus to South to South,&#13;
and starting with Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s investment to Uganda will be dampened. Thus, compromising planned infrastructure development projects and&#13;
therefore affecting growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The debt channel: As Uganda diversifies sources of financing in recent years, to finance the countryâ&#128;&#153;s ambitious infrastructure program, the bulk&#13;
of its non-concessional borrowing is coming from China. This has been financing the construction of the Kampala-Entebbe Highway, and two&#13;
major power dams (Karuma and Isimba). In 2013, Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s lending to Uganda was estimated at $596 million including a loan of $350 million from&#13;
Exim Bank China, repayable over 40 years at 2 percent to finance the Kampala-Entebbe Highway. The Government of Uganda also eyes China&#13;
for the upgrade of its railways system into standard gauge and the construction of the 600MW Karuma dam for a loan estimated at $9.7 billion.&#13;
The bulk of these loans, especially the recent large ones, are denominated in US $. However, about 50 percent of US $ 499 million worth of the&#13;
outstanding debt as of end June 2015, was denominated in Chinese Yuan. A devalued Chinese currency will reduce the amount of US $ required&#13;
to service the debt. More than a devalued Chinese currency, a weaker Chinese economy will have far more adverse effects on African economies&#13;
including Uganda.&#13;

FY 2015/16, almost the same level recorded during FY 2014/15.                decisions related to investments to facilitate oil production. Thus,&#13;
The potentially positive impact of low oil prices on economic activity       public investments are expected to be the main driver of growth.&#13;

higher growth would be achieved using fewer&#13;
resources. Public Investment Management (PIM) systems need to improve, in terms of strategic guidance for public projects (alignment to&#13;
NDP priorities and adoption of minimum technical and financial standards), project selection, budgeting and implementation (integration&#13;
into the budget cycle and medium-term expenditure frameworks), project audit and evaluation. Improving the efficiency of public investment&#13;
management (PIM), in terms of project appraisal, selection, implementation and evaluation, would increase the fiscal space available to&#13;
developing countries, like Uganda, to invest in vital infrastructure projects much needed for growth and development.&#13;
&#13;
The Government of Uganda has already taken steps to address the shortcomings in the area of PIM. The restructuring of the Ministry of Finance&#13;
to create a department in charge of Project Analysis and PPP is already a positive step forward. The World Bank is providing a technical&#13;
assistance for strengthening PIM to the Government of Uganda through a DfID trust fund. The aim of this technical assistance is threefold: (a)&#13;
developing public investment guidelines and manuals; (b) capacity building; and (c) establishing an institutional organization, framework and&#13;
arrangements to improve PIM System. The following activities are being prioritized in the context of the TA: (i) Simplified Manual for Public&#13;
Investment Appraisal; (ii) PIM Framework with recommendations on how the Government can improve the public management process to select&#13;
better projects; (iii) Training activities in Log Frame Approach, Cost Benefit Analysis and Cost Effectiveness for public officials; and (iv) Action Plan&#13;
with recommendations to establish an institutional organization, framework and arrangements to improve PIM System.&#13;

Financial Management (PFM) Act 2015 should result in significant                course of year. Hence, it eliminates the need for supplementary&#13;

       Box 3: Uganda Public Financial Management (PFM) Act, 2015&#13;
&#13;
The PFM Act was enacted in March 2015. It is a major milestone that consolidates earlier existing laws on the management (collection, allocation&#13;
and utilization) of public finances. It also updates existing PFM laws to accommodate emerging challenges. The PFM Act 2015 aims to streamline&#13;
and ensure efficient management of public resources. The salient points of the PFM act include:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   A Charter of Fiscal Responsibility that is aimed to ensure sound fiscal and macroeconomic management.&#13;
&#13;
This Charter requires that an elected government will, within three months following elections, be required to prepare and submit to Parliament&#13;
a Charter of Fiscal Responsibility that will: (i) provide measureable objectives for the fiscal policy for the next 3 years; (ii) explain the methodology&#13;
that will be used to measure government against set objectives; (iii) list sources of data; (iv) demonstrate how the fiscal objectives are consistent&#13;
with prudent macroeconomic management; and (v) consistently provide an economic and fiscal update on the set objectives.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   The Budget calendar should ensure that the budget for each financial year is effective as of the start of that financial year.&#13;
&#13;
This is aimed at ensuring predictability and timely availability of budget resources, thereby reducing budget implementation challenges. The&#13;
budget for the subsequent year is required to be approved by Parliament on May 31, before the resumption of the fiscal year. This budget&#13;
becomes effective on July 1, at the start of the fiscal year. This replaces the system where budget would be read to parliament in June and&#13;
became effective on September 1, allowing spending agents to depend on â&#128;&#152;vote on accountâ&#128;&#153; funding for the first quarter of the year.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Strict alignment of the budget with the National Development Plan.&#13;
&#13;
The annual budget shall be consistent with the NDP, the Charter of Fiscal Responsibility and the Budget Framework paper. As such, the annual&#13;
budget shall be accompanied by a certificate of compliance with the annual budget of the previous financial year, with this certificate to be&#13;
issued by the National Planning Authority. This is expected to limit in-year budget deviations that are inconsistent with approved budgets and&#13;
NDP.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Strict reporting requirements in PFM and budget cycle.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   The establishment of a contingency fund to accommodate unforeseen emerging budget priorities. This is intended to limit in year budget&#13;
     cuts for â&#128;&#152;weakâ&#128;&#153; sectors.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Removes flexibility of accounting officers to accumulate budget arrears.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   A vote shall not take any credit from a local company or body unless it has unpaid domestic arrears from debt incurred in a previous&#13;
     financial year. In addition, it has capacity to pay for expenditure from the approved estimates as appropriated by Parliament for that&#13;
     financial year.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Provides legal and regulatory framework for the collection, allocation and management of petroleum revenue&#13;
&#13;
The PFM Act 2015 provides for the establishment of a Petroleum Fund in which all petroleum revenues that accrue to Government will be paid.&#13;
Further, the Act provides for guidelines for collection, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers to the consolidated fund of petroleum revenues into&#13;
and from the Fund; the reporting and accountability modes, including requiring that reports of the petroleum fund are presented to Parliament&#13;
semi-annually by April 1 and December 31 every year. Amongst other matters, these reports should cover flows, volumes and sources of revenues&#13;
in the fund. The Act also provides for the establishment of a Petroleum Revenue Investment Reserve under Parliamentary oversight, as well as&#13;
guidelines and management for investments under the petroleum revenue investment reserve.&#13;

&#13;
For the process of urbanization to take place rapidly and                               1.	 Is the manner in which land is managed in Uganda promoting&#13;
efficiently, proper land use is critically important to ensuring                             productivity improvement and supportive of the transformation&#13;
that these areas drive growth in productivity and productive                                 process?&#13;
employment. The economic benefits of urban growth come from                             2.	 What can Uganda do to ensure that this fundamental factor of&#13;
exploiting economies of scale; from agglomeration effects; and from                          production supports economic transformation?&#13;
effective substitution between land and non-land inputs. One of the&#13;
most important pillars of an efficient city is appropriate land use,&#13;
which in turn is determined by land policies and institutions that&#13;
support urban efficiency. Increasing the density of economic activities&#13;
is one of the key features of successful urbanization, enabled by using&#13;
land for higher value activities over time.&#13;
&#13;
The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ambitious program to develop infrastructure&#13;
has faced major implementation challenges. The bulk of these&#13;
challenges relate to lack of proper land use policy; weak land&#13;
administration and management systems (including for valuation,&#13;
information storage and retrieval); and corruption. In a country where&#13;
most land is privately owned, public projects that require land face&#13;
major costs related to compensation, especially where new roads are                         as can be seen from the experience&#13;

Proper land administration and management :&#13;
A Key to productivity improvements, but how can it be done?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          27&#13;
&amp;#12;     Uganda is characterized by a high level of land tenure insecurity, with weak institutions for land&#13;
     management and administration, which factors are constraining the country from exploiting land to&#13;
     accelerate the pace of agricultural transformation; to plan and build effective cities; and to generally&#13;
     shift the economy to higher productivity levels. The cost of insecurity is high. For instance, It is estimated&#13;
     that land related disputes result in a loss of agricultural productivity of at least 5 to 11 percent of the total&#13;
     value of agricultural output. In addition, failure to manage land appropriately means that urban areas&#13;
     are failing to reach the level of density necessary to exploit economies of agglomeration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Improving the land tenure security and developing land markets requires a multipronged approach.&#13;
     On one hand Government can adopt measures to accelerate the registration of individually owned&#13;
     land, including use of innovative, cost efficient technology such as that used in Rwanda. On the other&#13;
     the institutions responsible for land administration, including its valuation as well as dispute resolution,&#13;
     must be strengthened. Yet in spite of the many policies pertaining, there are critical policy gaps to close&#13;
     to promote security and marketability of land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Only 20 percent of land in Uganda is registered, the bulk of which under the mailo land tenure system.&#13;
     Special attention ought to be given to the remaining 80 percent which, apart from holding a huge&#13;
     potential, is also more complicated to register as it includes land in northern and north-eastern Uganda&#13;
     that is predominantly communally owned. In addition to establishing communal land owning groups&#13;
     as legal entities whose land can be registered, linkages between communally owned land groups and&#13;
     investors should be established to negotiate legally binding stakes in promising investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Improving land use should not be restricted to private land, which could be taxed to discourage the&#13;
     practice of the acquisition of land as a non-productive investment, but also make better use of land&#13;
     owned by Government by registering the land and rectifying processes for its allocation. In addition,&#13;
     development of the National Urban Policy and National Housing Policy must be accelerated to guide the&#13;
     use of land in urban areas to promote more efficient and effective urbanization.&#13;

&amp;#12;         3.Faster economic transformation&#13;
         calls for better land management?&#13;
&#13;
The extent to which the use of land supports economic&#13;
growth and overall development depends to a significant&#13;
degree on the level of security of land rights.&#13;
&#13;
It also depends on the degree to which these rights can be transferred between individuals,&#13;
households, and firms and/or acquired by government institutions acting in the public&#13;
interest, with fair and full compensation paid to the owners of the land in such cases.&#13;
While Sub-Saharan Africa is endowed with half of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s uncultivated usable land, it is&#13;
vulnerable to land grabbing and expropriation without adequate compensation, as about&#13;
90 percent of its rural land is undocumented.11 In fact, in the last 10 years, investors have&#13;
claimed millions of hectares of agricultural land in violation of the principles of responsible&#13;
agro-investment in an environment that neither protects the land rights of local communities&#13;
nor secures long term interests of investors.12 Thus, despite the extent of the land available&#13;
for agriculture, a large proportion of Africaâ&#128;&#153;s population is affected by food insecurity and&#13;
productivity gaps;13 land degradation; and the proliferation of slums. It is no coincidence that&#13;
much of the continent remains mired in poverty. Is Uganda much different from comparable&#13;
countries on the continent? The next section attempts to address this question by exploring&#13;
the state of tenure security and the state of land markets that enable or constrain the transfer&#13;
of land rights from one entity or individual to another in Uganda. It then attempts to analyze&#13;
how these factors affect productivity, investments and growth.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                           the 1995&#13;

                                                                                                                           radical title, the&#13;
The three most important factors determining the level of land tenure security are: (i)                                    ultimate ownership&#13;
the existence of legally binding rights to an area of land; (ii) the existence of a system&#13;
                                                                                                                           of land, in the&#13;
to document, store and retrieve information regarding this land and the nature of the&#13;
rights to it; and (iii) the degree of efficiency and integrity of a system or mechanism                                    people of Uganda,&#13;
for resolving disputes related to those rights. In terms of the first of these factors, the                                enabling rights to a&#13;
legal rights to an area of land are ordinarily established by a formal system of tenure, the&#13;
nature of which is determined by the existing laws and regulations in the country. In terms                                particular piece of&#13;
of the second and third of these factors, the management of information and the resolution                                 land to be held in&#13;
of disputes are determined by the existence of institutions with a legal mandate and the&#13;
capacities to enable them to manage these issues.&#13;

&amp;#12;The current land tenure system in Uganda has evolved over                with evolving government policies, the Government may regulate&#13;
a long period, with good progress being made in terms of                 the use of land in the public interest. Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s land tenure system is&#13;
formulating and promulgating legislation to form a basis for             characterized by three positive aspects that conform to good practice.&#13;
security of land tenure. However, additional progress needs              Firstly, unlike in many other countries, where radical title is vested in&#13;
to be made to improve this legislation and to ensure that it is          the state, in Uganda, radical title is vested in the people. Secondly,&#13;

were promulgated and implemented during the colonial period              of the state to control land use in public interest is tightly defined in&#13;
to establish the foundations for a system for the management of          law to ensure that public interest does not include investment for&#13;
land and land rights. However, in the postcolonial period, the most      private gain. These characteristics give Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s land tenure system&#13;
significant act of legislation in these terms has been Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s 1995     a solid legal foundation for the efficient and effective management of&#13;
Constitution (see Annex 1). The 1995 Constitution vests radical title,   land. However, its mailo land tenure system, which is a specific form&#13;
the ultimate ownership of land, in the people of Uganda, enabling        of freehold tenure with strong historical roots, results in overlapping&#13;
rights to a particular piece of land to be held in accordance with the   land rights between the landlord and the tenants of the land, with&#13;
freehold, leasehold, mailo land and customary land tenure system.        the latter being legally recognized as lawful or bona fide occupants&#13;
It is estimated that 2 percent of land is held under freehold, 4 under   with inheritable and transactable rights similar to those of landlords.&#13;

ownership, and (see Figure 12). However, in all these cases, the         relatively strong, its implementation has often been uneven.&#13;
Government has residual authority to control land use in public&#13;
interest. Thus, under laws enacted by parliament and in accordance&#13;

At least until recently, Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s system for the documentation of        only approximately 20 percent of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s land is formally registered.&#13;
land rights and the management of related information has been           While this is in fact significantly higher than the average for Sub-&#13;
extremely dysfunctional. This dysfunctionality often resulted in         Saharan Africa, which stands at only around 10 percent, it still means&#13;
inefficiencies and created opportunities for corruption, with the land   that approximately 80 percent of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s land is undocumented&#13;

&amp;#12;is documented.14 With the limited extent of registration in Uganda,                           matters are taken into account.17 In Ethiopia, one-third to one-half&#13;
a significant proportion of land remains vulnerable to land grabbing                          of all cases within the formal judicial system are related to land&#13;

Courts, at the bottom of the hierarchy, are the institutions with which     different regions. In the central region, where a system of individual&#13;
members of the public generally have the most frequent contact.             land ownership predominates, land markets function very differently&#13;
Given that they are supposed to handle cases without imposing costs         from the north and north east, where a significant proportion of&#13;
on litigants, they are the court of choice for most ordinary members of     land is collectively owned. Indeed, with formal titles existing for&#13;
the community. However, the very lack of formal remuneration which          most land in central Uganda, this region is characterized by a&#13;
is their main attraction creates perverse incentives and opportunities      significantly more active market, without the constraints resulting&#13;
for corruption.                                                             from overlapping rights on mailo land. According to the Uganda&#13;

Thus, the formal institutions with a mandate for the resolution of          of acquisition of agricultural land in the central region involved&#13;
land disputes are generally weak, under-resourced, and lacking              purchases through formal markets, compared to 47 percent in the&#13;

play a significant role in areas of northern and north eastern Uganda       the northern regions. Except for the central region, where it accounts&#13;
where communal land ownership systems dominate, have been                   for 40 percent of the land acquisitions, the most dominant mode&#13;
weakened by many years of conflict, especially in the Acholi and            of acquisition is inheritance, which accounts for 49 percent of the&#13;
Lango sub-regions. Recent efforts by the Government to improve and          acquisitions in western region; 60 percent in eastern region; and&#13;
modernize both the formal institutions responsible for land dispute         91 percent in northern region. The low level of participation in the&#13;
resolution and their interface with the informal customary institutions     market in the Northern region is mainly because the majority of&#13;
that administer undocumented land, are commended and should be              land in this region is communally owned. The Human Rights Watch&#13;
accelerated and expanded upon.                                              Report of 2013 states that more than 90 percent of land in the Acholi&#13;
                                                                            sub-region is communally owned. There are considerable defects&#13;
                                                                            in the land markets in these regions. For example, according to the&#13;
&#13;
3.2 Land markets exist, but are still narrow,                               National Household Survey of 2005/06, due to the lack of clear and&#13;

As is the case with all forms of assets, the market plays a&#13;

                                                                            investment has been problematic due to the weakness of&#13;
enabling the transfer of land from less efficient users to more&#13;
                                                                            institutions involved in the valuation of land and to the related&#13;
efficient users. In essence, the market provides a means to facilitate&#13;
                                                                            high levels of corruption. As most land used for such investments is&#13;

                                                                            privately owned, the public sector is normally required to compensate&#13;
narrow the productivity gap between farms and among firms. To a&#13;
                                                                            land owners for the development of public projects such as the&#13;

&amp;#12;in a timely manner, even if a budget for the payment of compensation                           with transferring land, measures to improve the functioning of land&#13;
is available. The limited level of capacity to conduct assessments                             markets must include actions to reduce these costs. This is necessary&#13;
of the value of land and the limited availability of funds to pay the                          to ensure that land transfers from less efficient producers to more&#13;
appropriate level of compensation for the acquisition of this land have                        efficient producers take place fast and at minimum cost, thereby&#13;
been major constraints to the implementation of public investments,                            enhancing productivity.&#13;
as shown by the case of the construction of the Kampala-Entebbe&#13;
Expressway.25                                                                                  In addition to markets for the sale of land, Uganda has historically&#13;
                                                                                               had rental markets, with these markets providing access to land&#13;
Land markets in Uganda are also characterized by high transaction                              for those who cannot directly buy it. However, the efficiency and&#13;
costs. For projects to be attractive or even feasible for investors, the                       effectiveness of these markets has been declining in recent times.&#13;
process of acquiring and registering land must be cost efficient and                           Contrary to popular belief, Uganda has historically had active land&#13;
time efficient. In Uganda, it takes an average of 43 days to facilitate the                    rental markets. In a cross-country comparative study30 of land markets&#13;
transfer of land titles, with the average financial cost amounting to 2.6                      in Sub-Saharan Africa, with a specific focus on Eastern and Southern&#13;
percent of the value of the property. This is still better than some other                     Africa, it was found that land markets, particularly informal land rental&#13;
countries in the region, with it taking an average of 190 days to facilitate                   markets, are more widely spread and active than had generally been&#13;
the transfer of land titles in Angola and with the associated financial                        believed. The study found that land rental markets played a significant&#13;
costs of facilitating such a transfer in Lagos, Nigeria, amounting to up to                    role in improving the level of access to land for the land poor and&#13;
21 percent of the value of the property. However, the figures in Uganda                        provided rent income for those with land that they could not use&#13;
compare unfavorably to the average time for transferring property in                           productively. This finding mitigated fears raised earlier by a number&#13;
OECD countries.        26&#13;
                                                                                               of researchers that the development of land markets could cause&#13;
                                                                                               landlessness and an unhealthy concentration of land ownership.31&#13;
Costs associated with corruption also raise the overall transaction&#13;
costs for the transfer of land in Uganda. In Uganda, the average&#13;
recorded financial cost for transferring property is far lower than the&#13;
average of 4 percent of the value of the property in OECD countries.&#13;
However, in reality, in Uganda, the actual cost is far higher due to the&#13;
requirement to pay bribes to land administration services to facilitate&#13;
transactions. In some cases, these costs may be even higher than&#13;
the formal costs. In fact, according to Transparency Internationalâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
2013 Global Corruption report, land administration services were&#13;
regarded as the third most corrupt public institution, after the police&#13;
and the judiciary, with one in five people involved in transactions with&#13;
                                                                                                   Similarly, the East African Bribery&#13;
institutions responsible for the provision of these services reporting&#13;
that they had paid a bribe.27 Similarly, the East African Bribery Index                            Index states that in Uganda, in 2013,&#13;
states that in Uganda, in 2013, the average value of a bribe paid                                  the average value of a bribe paid by&#13;
by households for land administration services was about US$ 90&#13;
(equivalent to UGX 218,722).28 The value of such bribes was the third                              households for land administration&#13;
highest in a list of the average value of bribes paid to a total of 10                             services was about US$ 90 (equivalent&#13;
institutions, being slightly less than the value of similar bribes in&#13;
Kenya, where the value stood at slightly more than US$100 in 2012,&#13;
                                                                                                   to UGX 218,722).&#13;

to land for commercial crop production, such as for cocoa farming                              Despite the benefits derived from efficient rental markets,&#13;

rental markets facilitate the transfer of land to smaller producers,                           and its amendment in 2010 introduced legislation that aimed to&#13;
thereby promoting a more equitable distribution of land.34 In Malawi                           protect tenants from the obligation to pay excessive rent for the land&#13;
and Zambia, participation in the rural land rental market is strongly                          and from eviction. This legislation granted tenants fully transactable&#13;

&amp;#12;In the context of the issues addressed in this section, it is clear                         (a) Slow transformation of agriculture&#13;
that in Uganda, the role of the formal land markets is still&#13;
limited, particularly in areas where a large proportion of land                             Uganda has failed to facilitate a transformation of the&#13;

efficient distribution of land will be achieved. Unless this issue is                       land management being a major contributing factor. In spite&#13;
addressed, it will continue to serve as a significant constraint on                         of its huge potential, agriculture in Uganda has been growing&#13;

poverty reduction. Land plays a critically important role in the&#13;
social, political and economic life of Uganda. In the rural context,                        In Uganda, as a result of fragmentation and prevailing land&#13;

urban development, with a significant effect on building densities,                         output.40 However, smallholder farming is characterized by&#13;
mobility, and the provision of decent housing to the urban                                  inherent personalization and informality. This acts as a constraint&#13;

Economic development in Uganda has been constrained by a                                    technological innovation adoption and adaptation, which would&#13;
lack of tenure security and by the inefficient operation of land                            enable them to achieve higher levels of productivity as well as to&#13;
markets, both in rural and in urban areas. Many activities that                             internalize institutional costs.&#13;
could facilitate accelerated economic development, including the&#13;
commercialization of agriculture; the production of higher value                            However, larger farms in Uganda also record relatively low&#13;

Insecurity of land rights has acted as a constraint against                         with not more than five employees, with the vast majority of&#13;
investments in agriculture, irrespective of the size of the                         these businesses engaged in the services sector. Attempts to&#13;

ease of doing business, in the area of the challenges involved                         lending.51 By contrast, in Uganda, a large proportion of the&#13;
in the transfer of property rights, Uganda ranks 125th out of                          population remains excluded from accessing credit due to the lack&#13;
189 countries.48 And in the enterprise survey49 the difficulty of                      of such collateral. At present, the total value of credit provided to&#13;
accessing land ranked among the six most significant constraints                       the private sector in Uganda is equivalent to 13.5 percent of GDP.&#13;

&#13;
The limited extent to which land is formally registered&#13;
and the lack of security of tenure also acts as a constraint&#13;
against accessing finance and to the overall development of&#13;
financial services. The ability to use land as collateral enables                         The sugar sector, for instance, is&#13;
the mobilization of capital embedded in land, thereby expanding&#13;

facilitates the use of these titles as collateral, reducing the cost                      based on sustainable development&#13;
of accessing credit. In developed countries, on average, more&#13;
than two thirds of small business loans are secured on the basis&#13;

&amp;#12;       Box 4: Firms do not use bank credit to finance investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In line with Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s regulatory requirements for firm registration, up to 87 percent of firms hold bank accounts. This&#13;
     level is similar to the average for Sub-Saharan Africa, and only slightly lower than the World Average of 88 percent&#13;
     (Table B1). The value of collateral required to secure a loan also falls below the world average. However, firms in&#13;
     Uganda do not use bank credit to a significant extent, either for investments or for working capital. According to the&#13;
     2013 enterprise survey, only 8 percent of Ugandan firms financed their investments with bank loans, compared to the&#13;
     global average of 27 percent. The majority of firms (80 percent) still financed their investments using internal sources,&#13;
     compared to the global average of 69 percent across the world, with some 13 percent securing financing through&#13;
     equity or stocks. To secure working capital, and even smaller proportion of firms use bank credit as the source of&#13;
     financing, with only 7 percent of businesses doing so, compared to the average of 10 percent across SSA.&#13;

Financial institutions in Uganda generally insist that                   growth, with these potential benefits including economies&#13;
borrowers provide some form of collateral in order to mitigate           of scale; agglomeration; and the effective substitution&#13;
the high risk of lending in an environment where information             of land with non-land inputs. The development of efficient&#13;
is scarce and unreliable. Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s financial infrastructure              cities is predicated upon an efficient system of land use, which&#13;
remains underdeveloped, with one of the characteristics of this          in turn is determined by the promulgation of the appropriate&#13;
underdevelopment being a high level of risk aversion on the part         policies and the development of the appropriate institutions to&#13;
of lending institutions. Uganda ranks relatively lowly in terms of       ensure their effective implementation. An increased density of&#13;
the credit indicator of the Ease of Doing Business index. In terms of    economic activities is one of the key characteristics of successful&#13;
the depth of credit information, Uganda scores 0 points on a scale       urbanization, with this increased density being achieved through&#13;
of 0 to 6. In terms of the strength of the legal rights of creditors,    the use of a greater proportion of land for higher value activities.&#13;
Uganda also ranks relatively lowly (6 points out of 12), primarily       At present, land-related constraints create significant entry&#13;
because there is no collateral registry and secured creditors are        costs for businesses in urban areas. For instance, despite recent&#13;
not paid first. An increase in the extent of easily transferable legal   restructuring, it still takes an average of 154 days and costs the&#13;
titles would unleash this â&#128;&#156;dead capitalâ&#128;&#157; so that it could be used        equivalent of 11 percent of the value of a warehouse for a business&#13;
as collateral to secure loans to fund new businesses or for other        to obtain a construction permit in Kampala, while registering&#13;
purposes.                                                                property takes 43 days.&#13;

                                                                         given the current state of land management. Following the&#13;
Lack of land tenure security and undeveloped land markets                promulgation of the 1995 constitution, which created private land&#13;
have also prevented Uganda from fully benefiting from                    ownership and either converted to freehold land leases vested&#13;

of land parcels and rapid suburbanization has ensued, with fiscally                          land use in a given administrative unit, have practically failed to&#13;
starved local governments unable to acquire land and protect                                 override private interests. They have no leverage of power to control&#13;
rights-of-way for infrastructure improvements. On the other hand,                            access and ownership of urban land. Three, the existing policy lays&#13;
unhealthy rural-urban migration could be exacerbated by the                                  much emphasis onto tenure security rather than development.&#13;
unclear property rights and related conflicts that adversely affect                          For instance, 7 percent of Kampalaâ&#128;&#153;s land area is associated with&#13;
agriculture and have created disincentives for investment and are                            Kabakaâ&#128;&#152;s unplanned settlements while 75 percent belongs to&#13;
estimated to have reduced agricultural productivity by up to 25                              private mailo. It is mainly because of this type of land ownership&#13;
percent. Yet customary tenure systems in the East and North restrict                         structure that development control has not been affected in the city&#13;
the sale and rent of land.                                                                   as expected. It also perpetuates land speculation which withdraws&#13;
                                                                                             land from the market thereby causing artificial shortage which&#13;
The lack of fluidity of land as an asset acts as a constraint                                increases the cost of land. Four, multiple land tenure systems exist&#13;
against the achievement of higher levels of productivity and                                 in Kampala which constrain the preparation and implementation&#13;
economic integration as urbanization progresses. For example,                                of agreed physical plans. For example, transport and school&#13;
the existence of efficient land rental markets, made possible by                             development plans initiated by the central government or city&#13;

migration, enabling residents of rural areas to participate in more                          and urban councils do not have land title. Especially revealing is the&#13;
rewarding off farm activities. The existence of such markets enables                         case of Makindye Division, where there are contradictions in land&#13;

and cities, where they were able to engage in more remunerative                              the expropriation of land and the payment of compensation, both&#13;

&amp;#12;         4. What should Uganda do to ensure&#13;
         land contributes rather than con-&#13;
         strains productivity improvements?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The discussion in the previous section shows that in&#13;
Uganda, the limited ability to transfer land may be acting as&#13;
a binding constraint on endeavors to improve productivity&#13;
in both rural and urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
The increasing population density in urban areas has been accompanied by increased&#13;
difficulty in utilizing land for new purposes and for transferring ownership from&#13;
one entity to another. In turn, this has acted as a constraint on investment and on the&#13;
achievement of a transformation characterized by an increase in higher productivity activities.&#13;
This situation is at least partly the result of a failure by the Government to address bad laws&#13;
that have created overlapping rights and conflicting interests. The Government has also&#13;
inadequately facilitated the development of institutions that can manage land transactions&#13;
appropriately. In addition, in many regions, land markets are either non-existent or are&#13;
dysfunctional, being characterized by a high rate of speculative transactions, especially in&#13;
urban areas and in areas in which significant public infrastructure development projects&#13;
are being implemented. In rural areas, these dysfunctional markets enable exploitative&#13;
transactions, which result from a lack of information and/or unequal power relations between&#13;
buyers and sellers. This dysfunctionality has resulted in an increased rate of occurrence&#13;
of conflicts and disputes. If current patterns of land management continue, a significant&#13;
proportion of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s population will remain poor due to the failure to transform the               If current patterns&#13;

The Government must strive to sustain the progress made                                    with Uganda, this report recommends four points of action to&#13;
in formulating policies related to land management and                                     address critical issues related to land use and the transferability&#13;
administration to close gaps and accelerate the achievement of                             of land assets and to strengthen institutions responsible for&#13;
its goals. The Ugandan authorities have made important strides in                          the administration of land and land tenure. The first two of&#13;
the establishment of a smart policy framework for land management                          these actions build on the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s prior achievements and&#13;
and administration. In addition to the National Land Use Policy                            involve: (i) accelerating the process of land registration; and (ii)&#13;
of 2007 and the National Land Policy of 2013, the Government is                            redesigning the Land Fund to ensure that it operates more efficiently&#13;
currently in the advanced stages of developing a complementary                             and equitably. The second two actions are intended to accelerate&#13;
National Resettlement Policy, National Urban Policy and a National                         the implementation of land reforms and involve: (iii) strengthening&#13;

of land information systems. According to the 1995 Constitution&#13;
and the terms of the Land Act 1998, the Uganda Land Commission                             4.1 Accelerating the process of land registration&#13;

registration of individual land rights more generally. These policies                      achievement of this goal. The Government has already implemented&#13;
should be informed by and be consistent with regional and global                           a number of measures to systematically register land, with various&#13;
initiatives for land reform to which Uganda is a party, including the                      measures intended to ensure registration of individually, communally&#13;

  Box 5: Registering Land Rights fast and cheaply: Experience from Rwanda&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Rwanda first embarked on a systematic land tenure regularization program with the implementation of a pilot program in the period&#13;
from 2008 to 2009, following which the program was scaled up in the period from 2010 to 2013. This program utilized a systematic&#13;
community-by-community participatory approach implemented in cooperation with local land committees. Low technology&#13;
â&#128;&#156;general boundariesâ&#128;&#157; rules and simple methods of boundary demarcation were utilized by locally trained para-surveyors, who&#13;
used aerial photography and/or satellite imagery to conduct mapping. By March 2015, virtually all land parcels in Rwanda, a total&#13;
of 11.3 million, had been demarcated, with 8.3 million land titles having been approved and printed for issuance. However, only&#13;
7.2 million land titles, representing about 64 percent of the total number of demarcated plots, had been collected by owners. The&#13;
gap (36 percent) between the number of demarcated land parcels and the collected titles may be attributed to a number of factors,&#13;
including the absence of owners, with some being located outside the country. Another factor may have been the inability of some&#13;
owners to pay for the land titles, despite the low fees charged.&#13;
&#13;
The total cost of the land title regularization program was about US $ 60 million, of which 25 percent was funded by the Government&#13;
of Rwanda and the rest by development partners, including DFID. Of the total cost of US $ 60 million, approximately US $ 7 million&#13;
(about 12%) was recovered through fees charged for the collection of titles, with these fees amounting to an average of approximately&#13;
US $ 1.6 per parcel, except in Kigali (the capital), where the fee imposed averaged at approximately US $ 8.3. The average cost of&#13;
demarcating a parcel and issuing the associated title deed was approximately US $ 8. On average, the cost recovery for the program&#13;
was 12 percent, implying a total subsidy of 88 percent. However, land owners in the capital paid the full cost, while the owners&#13;
outside the capital received a subsidy of about 80 percent. It should be noted that the average cost per title of US $ 8 is low, given&#13;
that the average cost of similar exercises globally is in the range of US $ 20. Despite the low cost, the program significantly improved&#13;
tenure security and womenâ&#128;&#153;s access to land and it also increased land rental market activities (Ali, Deininger and Goldstein 2011).&#13;

11.3 million land parcels across the entire country and issued                          formalization of landowning groups. More than 50 land owning&#13;
land titles for 7.1 million of these parcels at an average cost                         groups have already been organized, out of which ten have&#13;

relies on low cost cadastral index maps to demarcate and register                       these areas would likely be more receptive to engaging in land&#13;
land. The Ugandan Government is in the process of adopting                              markets if they were able to rent out their land, rather than selling&#13;

&amp;#12;  Box 6: Land Rental Markets in Communally Owned Land: Experiences in Mexico, Fiji and Ghana&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mexico: Ejidos are communal settlements owned by beneficiaries of land reform processes in Mexico. These settlements were subject to&#13;
an accelerated land reform process in the period from 1992 to 1999, with this process involving the formalization of community groups&#13;
as land owners; the establishment of community self-governance institutions; and the registration of communal land rights. Within a five&#13;
year period, 57.2 million hectares of land were measured and mapped, with 2.9 million households receiving certificates to individual,&#13;
common, and housing land. The program increased security of land access for approximately 1 million households who previously had&#13;
few or no land rights. It also improved governance: more than 18,000 Ejidos formalized internal bylaws through the assembly, with 90&#13;
percent electing representatives through a democratic process. The program provided a strong legal basis for numerous contracts and&#13;
joint ventures between Ejidos and entities from outside the communities.&#13;
&#13;
Ghana: About 80 percent of Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s land is held under customary tenure. This land is administered by traditional authorities (chiefs)&#13;
who are recognized by Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s Constitution as trustees with the authority to allocate land to their subjects for use. The traditional&#13;
authorities are also empowered to endorse individual allocations of land for registration. As legal trustees, traditional authorities are&#13;
also empowered to enter into long term leases with investors. In fact, they are the main source of land for commercial investments in&#13;
agriculture in Ghana.&#13;
&#13;
Fiji: About 87 percent of land in Fiji is held under customary title (native land). This land is owned communally by indigenous Fijians,&#13;
who make about half of Fijiâ&#128;&#153;s population. Fijians of Indian origin make up about 45 percent of the population but do not own land.&#13;
However, the Fijians of Indian origin are the key planters of sugar cane, with this planting being conducted on native land leased from&#13;
indigenous Fijians on 30-year renewable leases, with lease arrangements managed by an autonomous entity called iTaukei Land Trust&#13;
Board (TLTB). TLTB manages land transactions involving other entities, including local and foreign investors.&#13;

Government-owned land should also be demarcated and                                     shown. For example, in Ghana, a similar process enabled the&#13;
registered to promote the achievement of higher levels of                               Government to start managing state land assets more effectively&#13;
productivity. The Government still owns large amounts of land                           and productively. The Government of Ghana is in the process of&#13;
either directly or indirectly, including land declared as public land                   preparing a comprehensive policy for the management of public&#13;
during the colonial period. Much of this land is either unused                          land (see Box 7).&#13;
or underused. For this type of land, the most urgent action is to&#13;
undertake an inventory to establish the status of occupation and                        To promote its efficient use, all land, including that owned&#13;
the purpose for which the land is used. Once this process has                           by religious and cultural institutions, should be clearly&#13;
been completed, the land could then be allocated to the land                            demarcated and registered. Cultural and religious institutions&#13;
poor and to investors on the basis of transparent and competitive                       have large holdings of unused and underutilized land, both&#13;
processes, as advocated by the National Land Policy 2013, while                         in rural and urban areas. As in the case of government owned&#13;
resisting pressures from business entities that wish to obtain                          land, much of this land is not properly demarcated. Often,&#13;
government land without going through competitive processes                             its occupation status and the purpose for which it is used is&#13;
. There is no doubt that there will be some obstacles to the                            not clearly defined. Hence, there is a need for an inventory to&#13;
implementation of this plan, as it may involve the displacement                         demarcate and identify the status of occupation and use. While&#13;
of entities currently utilizing the land. However, the benefits                         recognizing that this is private land administered by cultural&#13;
could be significant, as experiences in other countries have                            and religious authorities as trustees, the Government has an&#13;

     not only the land owners and tenants, but the nation as a                          management of their lands, in a similar way as the Government&#13;
     whole. To promote the efficient use of these lands, one option                     of Ghana has supported traditional authorities to establish&#13;
     is for government to provide subsidies by way of grants and                        Customary Land Secretariats for land administration and to&#13;
     technical assistance to religious and cultural authorities to:                     demarcate allodial boundaries.&#13;

&#13;
           Box 7: State land inventories: Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s experience&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Ghana has a large stock of government-owned land, most of which was accumulated during the 1950s under the radical land&#13;
     policies of Kwame Nkrumah. In 2001, it was estimated that the Ghanaian government owned 40 percent of all urban and peri-urban&#13;
     land (Kasanga and Kotey 2001). To improve the management of state-owned land, in the period from 2003 to 2010, the Ghanaian&#13;
     Government worked to establish a national inventory of these lands, with the objective of establishing accurate information as a&#13;
     basis for decisions related to the management of public land. The process involved the collection of information on the location,&#13;
     size, ownership, and the boundary measurements of land, as well as current land use and encumbrances, including the presence of&#13;
     squatters. Ten consulting firms implemented pilot inventory exercises in three regions of the country, through which 1,144 sites were&#13;
     identified, significantly greater than the 288 sites compiled from public land sector agenciesâ&#128;&#153; records. The exercise provided a clearer&#13;
     picture of the composition of government land and of the principal sources of tension in communities impacted by government&#13;
     land acquisitions. For example, of the 722 sites inventoried, only 58 (less than 10 percent) were formally acquired, compensated&#13;
     for, and fully used for their intended purpose; 198 sites (27 percent) were occupied and used by state agencies without any formal&#13;
     acquisition process; the acquisition status could not be established for 377 (52 percent) sites; and 6 sites reserved by the state were&#13;
     never formally acquired and were not being used for the intended purpose.&#13;

     This will require the Government to promote the sharing and                       disentangle the overlapping land rights and to make the land&#13;
     redistribution of land between mailo landlords and tenants                        more productive. First, the operational priorities of the Land&#13;
     through free negotiations between the two parties to enable                       Fund should be revised from the single political objective of&#13;
     one party to buy out the rights of the other, followed by support                 restitution to that of a multi-objective operation that not only&#13;
     to improve productivity on the land. Current operations of                        addresses restitution, but also poverty reduction. This should&#13;
     the Land Fund are not efficient and equitable (see Box 8). The                    be achieved by prioritizing the provision of support to poor&#13;

  Box 8: Uganda Land Fund to address historical injustices and landlessness&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Land Fund (LF) was created under the Land Act of 1998, to be managed by the Uganda Land Commission (ULC) to&#13;
primarily (a) give loans to lawful and bona fide occupants to buy out and register residual interests of landlords or to buy&#13;
on their behalf those residual interests to settle injustices caused during the colonial era; and (b) resettle people rendered&#13;
landless by Government action, natural disaster or any other cause. Since FY 2002/03 when it started its operations, the&#13;
LF received funding of UShs 31.1 billion and acquired 62,279.74 hectares of land with bona fide occupants on it in Kibaale&#13;
district, thereby buying out the interests of landlords. However, the ULC has not taken any further action on the land: it&#13;
has neither transferred the ownership interests to the bona fide occupants nor evicted them. Furthermore, since its&#13;
establishment, the LF has not undertaken any actions to improve the productivity of the land it purchased partly because&#13;
productivity improvement is not part of its mandate. Based on the amount of land purchased and the money put into the&#13;
LF, the approximate cost is nearly UShs 500,000 per hectare. In the meantime, the design of the fund also led to distortion&#13;
of prices on account of the land lordsâ&#128;&#153; expectation that their land was to be bought off by the fund. For Kibaale district, it&#13;
was found that by 2004, just one year after the setup of the fund, prices for mailo land had increased to levels higher than&#13;
the expected future income stream from agricultural production on that land, and also higher than prices for freehold and&#13;
customary land, despite the encumbrances on mailo land (Deininger, Ayalew and Yamano 2006).&#13;

     Box 9: Land acquisition and development for the poor: Experience from Malawi and Brazil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 To address the highly unequal distribution of overcrowded arable land, which coexists with underused large-scale farms, Malawi&#13;
 piloted a land reform program with funding from the World Bank (World Bank 2004). The pilot project aimed to increase the income&#13;
 of about 15,000 rural poor families using a decentralized, community-based, and voluntary approach in four districts. Modeled on&#13;
 Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s market-based approach to land reform (under implementation since the mid-1990s), the pilot had three key elements: (a)&#13;
 voluntary acquisition by communities of land sold by willing estate owners; (b) resettlement and on-farm development, including&#13;
 transportation of settlers, establishment of shelter, and purchase of basic inputs and advisory services; and (c) survey and registration&#13;
 of redistributed land. Land reform beneficiaries, organized in voluntary groups, were self-selected on the basis of predefined eligibility&#13;
 criteria. Each family received a grant of US$1,050, managed directly by beneficiaries, with up to 30 percent for land acquisition&#13;
 and the rest for transportation, water, shelter, and farm development. Land for the project was acquired from willing sellers, the&#13;
 government, or private donations and was registered initially under group title; it is expected that individual titles will be provided&#13;
 to beneficiaries upon demand in the future. Implementation was decentralized through District Assembly institutions and required&#13;
 capacity enhancement, especially for surveying and registration.&#13;
&#13;
 According to the impact evaluation, the project achieved even better results than the Brazilian model on which it was based (World&#13;
 Bank 2009): more than 1.5 hectares of land were distributed, on average, to each of 15,142 rural households (40,102 households in&#13;
 Brazil); agricultural incomes increased an average of 40 percent per year for beneficiaries (compared to non-beneficiaries) between&#13;
 2005â&#128;&#147;06 and 2008â&#128;&#147;09 (6 percent in Brazil); the economic rate of return was 20 percent (13 percent in Brazil); and impacts on the&#13;
 livelihoods of beneficiaries and surrounding communities were positive, with improvements in landholdings, land tenure security,&#13;
 crop production, productivity, income, and food security (similar results in Brazil).&#13;

&amp;#12;  Box 10: How technology is improving land administration in Uganda - The Uganda Land Information System&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In 2005, Uganda embarked on a program to rehabilitate and modernize its land administration system. A core component of this&#13;
program is its computerized Land Information System (LIS).&#13;
&#13;
Following the implementation of a baseline study and a conceptual design in the period from 2007 to 2008, the development of&#13;
LIS was planned for implementation in two phases. First, in the period from 2010 to 2013, a three-year pilot was implemented in&#13;
six zonal offices, with these six offices together holding approximately 70 percent of all registered land titles in Uganda. The LIS was&#13;
implemented along with a legal review and a program to rehabilitate land offices; to re-engineer business processes and work flows;&#13;
and to build institutional capacities. This pilot phase became fully operational in March 2013.&#13;
&#13;
What has been the impact?&#13;
&#13;
While it is still too early to draw comprehensive conclusions regarding the long-term impacts of the program, in the short term, LIS has&#13;
achieved the following: (a) a decrease in the average time to transfer property: In the Masaka zonal office, for example, the average&#13;
time taken to facilitate the transfer of property titles decreased from 227 days in 2007 to an average of 26 days in 2014. While it still&#13;
takes about two months to implement such transfers in the less successful zonal offices, such as the one in Wakiso, the average time&#13;
is now significantly lower than 57 days, which is the average time for such transfers in the sub-Saharan African region; (b) decreases&#13;
in the time to conduct searches: The average time taken to complete a search (verification of land ownership and encumbrances on&#13;
the title) declined from 50 days to 8 days in Masaka, and to 32 days in the worst performing zonal office, in Wakiso; and (c) decreases&#13;
in the time taken to facilitate bank mortgages: The time taken to process a bank mortgage has been reduced from more than 50 days&#13;
to 7 days in Mbarara, and to 48 days in the worst performing zonal office of Wakiso. The potential to improve performance in all these&#13;
areas is high, given that the high service standards defined by the Client Charter have been achieved for a significant proportion of&#13;
land related transactions, with 22 percent of the land transfers being completed in 10 days, 12 percent of mortgages being registered&#13;
in three days and 21 percent of searches also being completed in 3 days. In addition to efficiency gains in land transactions, there&#13;
has been an impressive increase in the value of monthly land-related revenues, from US$ 0.7 million in 2012/13 to US$ 3.5 million in&#13;
2013/14, representing a fivefold increase.&#13;
&#13;
The roll-out phase, which commenced in 2015, is expected to extend the LIS from six to 21 zonal offices. In this phase, the functional&#13;
coverage of the program will be extended to physical planning and valuation. It will also facilitate the establishment of electronic&#13;
linkages between land administration services and strategic clients and partners, including banks and real estate agents.&#13;
&#13;
During the roll out phase, it is expected that the time taken complete land and mortgage registration and searches will be reduced to a&#13;
single day. This will result in an additional boost to land-related revenue, since the valuation function will be fully computerized.&#13;

b) Strengthening systems for valuation of land                                   In addition, government valuers, under the leadership&#13;
                                                                                 of the Chief Government Valuer, are responsible for the&#13;
The ability of government institutions to accurately and                         establishment of standards and regulations to guide the&#13;
efficiently conduct land valuations plays a vital role in a                      valuation of land by private sector entities and to facilitate&#13;
number of processes, including the following: (i) Expropriation                  the development of valuation data bases that can be used&#13;
and compensation: Accurate valuations are required in order to                   by all valuers in the public and private sectors to undertake&#13;
ensure that fair compensation is paid to the original owners of the              their work. This process is particularly critical in urban areas,&#13;
land; (ii) Revenue collections: Accurate valuations facilitate the               where a credible system for documenting and valuing land&#13;
collection of revenue by enabling an accurate assessment of the                  will go a long way towards streamlining transactions and&#13;
value of stamp duties to be charged on land transfers and of the                 eliminating speculation. However, the existing system needs&#13;
property rates to be collected by municipal authorities.                         to be strengthened and improved into an efficient valuation&#13;

including the LGs through the District land boards; setting quality                     its systems for the resolution of land-related disputes and to&#13;

valuations in the public sector and to establish valuation                              in themselves have a significant positive impact in reducing land-&#13;
databases and standards and regulations that can improve the                            related disputes. However, there will still be a need to establish&#13;
performance of private sector valuers. Implementation of this                           effective systems and to provide necessary resources to resolve&#13;
process should be accelerated to ensure that valuation services                         emerging land disputes quickly and at low-cost. As already&#13;
and standards are improved rapidly.                                                     alluded to, this would require filling the institutional vacuum in&#13;

                                                                                        and for the whole country, it would also require building&#13;
The capacities of urban institutions responsible for financial                          competent formal institutions for dispute resolution by providing&#13;
management need to be strengthened in order to enable                                   adequate staff, budget and training to judges, magistrates, Local&#13;

                                                                                         In China, these measures are estimated to have increased&#13;
Despite â&#128;&#147; or perhaps partly because of â&#128;&#147; the existence of this                           agricultural productivity by approximately 60 percent.69 In&#13;
wide range of land-related laws and policies, there are still                            Vietnam, participation in rental markets grew from 3.8 percent&#13;
critical gaps in the policy framework. To support the effective                          in 1993 to 15.8 percent in 1998, with the development of both&#13;
implementation of land reforms, it is vital that these gaps be                           rental and sales markets being found to have an unambiguously&#13;
addressed. Critical gaps identified in this update include the                           positive impact on productivity.70 In addition, the reforms in&#13;
following: (i) the need to amend laws to remove restrictions on                          China reduced population pressures in the densely populated&#13;
rental markets to improve landlord-tenant relations on both                              agricultural areas by facilitating out-migration, with this process&#13;
mailo and freehold land; (ii) the establishment of disincentives to                      resulting in an increase in the share of migrants to Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
discourage the speculative holding of unused land for extended                           urban labor force from 5 percent in 1988 to 17 percent in 2000,&#13;
periods of time; (iii) the need to clarify policies governing the use                    representing a total of 124.6 million people.71,72 In Vietnam, the&#13;
of urban land, including the provision of incentives to encourage                        reform process increased the rate of migration by households&#13;
vertical expansion and multi-purpose usage of structures as                              from 29 percent in 1993 to 64 percent in 1998.73&#13;
a means to promote increased density and sustainable urban&#13;
development; (iv) the adoption of innovative instruments for land                        There are two critical factors that enable land rental markets&#13;
pooling, financing and development to achieve economies of                               to operate efficiently, these being land tenure security and&#13;
scale and equitable urban land development; and (v) measures                             the elimination of restrictions on land rental markets. While&#13;
to address the issue of expropriation and compensation and                               registration of land is critical, it must be supported by a legal&#13;
thereby to promote the principle of fairness and equity. The                             framework that does not overly constrain landlords and tenants&#13;
current market-based practice often underestimates the value                             from negotiating freely the terms and conditions of the rental or&#13;
of future income from the investment for which the land is being                         lease of land. Thus, in the Ugandan context, existing restrictions&#13;
acquired, and often does not factor in the cost of moving people                         on land rental markets, especially the fixing of nominal rents at&#13;
into a new area of settlement and the restoration of livelihoods                         uneconomic levels, as under the Land (Amendments) Act 2010,&#13;
to at least the level that existed before the expropriation. To                          need to be eliminated, as advocated by the 2013 National Land&#13;
achieve this goal, it is vital that the authorities not merely                           Policy. These restrictions have driven landlords out of rental&#13;
strengthen regulations, but ensure that existing regulations are                         markets and made tenants more vulnerable to eviction, which is&#13;
appropriately enforced.                                                                  the exact opposite of the intended purpose of the Act.&#13;
&#13;
a) Removing restrictions on rental markets                                               b) Optimizing usage of land to promote markets&#13;
&#13;
To ensure the development of more effective land rental                                  In Uganda, much land remains idle and functions merely as&#13;
markets and thereby to facilitate increased access to land,                              a highly illiquid form of savings. Uganda could learn from the&#13;
the Government could learn from the experiences of China                                 experiences of other countries, where measures have been&#13;
and Vietnam, but keeping in mind that the land reform                                    implemented to promote land markets as a means of optimizing&#13;
agenda in China has some way to go especially to lift a ban                              the use of land and ensuring that it serves as a productive asset.&#13;
on rural land sales and mortgages, and to pay adequate                                   With the limited availability of savings instruments in Uganda,&#13;
compensation for expropriated land. These countries                                      many Ugandans use land as an investment vehicle for their&#13;
implemented measures to develop land rental markets with                                 savings. This has led to speculative buying and the accumulation&#13;
initiatives first implemented during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.                         of unused land in both rural and urban areas. To discourage this&#13;

&amp;#12;practice, Ugandan policy makers should consider the introduction                         land being exempt. Other urban authorities hardly bother with the&#13;
of a punitive tax to act as a disincentive. A number of countries                        collection of such rates. Overall, the collected property rate tax is&#13;
have imposed taxes on agricultural land to encourage landowners                          estimated to be around 1 percent of the property value.&#13;
to use it productively. Countries that impose taxes on agricultural&#13;
land include Rwanda, South Africa, Namibia, Jamaica, Colombia,                           In addition, a number of other taxes are imposed on landowners,&#13;
Brazil, St. Lucia, Japan and the USA.74 Rwanda imposes a property                        including taxes on rental incomes (30%); capital gains tax (15%);&#13;
tax on freehold land, while annual lease fees are paid on leasehold                      and Value Added Tax (18%). However, to increase the value of&#13;
land with a certificate of registration, except for agricultural land of                 collected revenues and to promote efficient land markets, it is&#13;
less than two hectares. Property taxes are paid at the simple rate                       most important that at least the two main land-related taxes,&#13;
of one thousandth of the taxable value of the land each year. The                        namely the stamp duty and property rate tax, be effectively and&#13;
fee structure for land lease fees is complex, with rates set within                      efficiently administered, with the collection of these taxes being&#13;
minimum and maximum thresholds and related to market value                               extended to all eligible tax payers. To achieve this, the following&#13;
of land, with the level of the fee depending on the use to which the                     steps should be implemented: (i) a more intensive utilization of&#13;
land is put and its size, with these levels being determined by each                     the LIS in the six zonal centers, which cover approximately 70&#13;
district.75                                                                              percent of land transactions; (ii) an intensification over the next&#13;
                                                                                         five years of the use of the cadastral and registration data and of&#13;
An additional measure to avoid keeping land idle and to free                             the improved valuation system and its links with the scaled up&#13;
it up for more productive use is to reduce the duration of                               LIS covering the rest of the country to extend revenue collection&#13;
statutory leases, in the way of leasehold, from the current                              efforts to cover the whole country; (iii) reductions in exemptions&#13;
99 years to a more realistic duration of up to 49 years that is                          from tax through an extension of the tax system to include&#13;
closer to the period required by an investor to recover the                              residential property and undeveloped property, although at lower&#13;
money invested in land. This would put Uganda on the same                                rates than for commercial and industrial property; and (iv) an&#13;
footing as some other developing countries in the continent and                          extension of the property rate tax system to registered rural land&#13;
beyond including Rwanda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mozambique,                                 after five years, at a point when the proportion of registered land is&#13;
Viet Nam and China, and these countries have moreover been                               expected to have increased from 20 percent to 30 percent.&#13;
doing well in attracting both local and foreign investment&#13;
into agriculture. The reduction in leasehold from 99 years to a                          c) Improving urban land management&#13;
maximum of 49 years should initially be done for foreign investors&#13;
and then gradually extended to Ugandan citizens.                                         With the rapid process of urbanization in Uganda, it is vitally&#13;
                                                                                         important that systems are implemented to ensure that urban&#13;
Ugandan policies should strive to implement an efficient                                 land is allocated optimally. The allocation of this land should be&#13;
framework to tax land to promote efficient land markets. Land                            consistent with land use planning regulations and designed to&#13;

Even this stamp duty is under-collected due to a proliferation                           institutions highlighted above are critically important measures for&#13;
of informal land sales and under declarations of the sale price.                         the foundation of an efficient system for urban land management.&#13;
For example, when the LIS became fully operational in February                           It will also be necessary to implement specific actions to improve&#13;

increased dramatically, with this value increasing fivefold in the                       to be used even more efficiently. Such reforms should focus on&#13;

would be protected from the negative impacts of expropriation.                        Ugandan policy makers should also give serious consideration to&#13;

In consideration of these weaknesses, there is a need to: (i)                         rights is at the point of inheritance. To promote womenâ&#128;&#153;s access&#13;

In the area of land ownership, Ugandan women continue to&#13;
face significant institutionalized and informal discrimination.&#13;

This discrimination is not only unjust, it also acts as a significant                   largest organized agriculture sector&#13;
constraint on economic growth. Increasing womenâ&#128;&#153;s access&#13;
to land and improving their security of tenure would be&#13;

&#13;
     Pre- independence          During the British colonial period, land reforms mainly in the central (Buganda,            Created freehold system of land ownership in the central region, thereby&#13;

&#13;
     1900 Agreement             Divided land in Buganda into Mailo land and Crown land. Mailo land was doled out            Customary unwritten right to use the land for grazing and farming were&#13;

                                Landlords were hiking the â&#128;&#152;Busuuluâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;Envujjoâ&#128;&#153; rates haphazardly.&#13;

            Searching for the 'grail' : can
            Uganda's land support its prosperity drive?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Over the past twenty years, Uganda’s
            population density has been increasing rapidly, placing
            significant pressure on the use of land. Uganda now has a
            population density of 194 persons per square kilometer of
            arable land, compared to 80 in Kenya and 116 in Ghana. At
            present, the majority of Uganda’s population still lives in
            rural areas, where the main source of livelihood is
            agriculture. However, the proportion of the population
            living in urban areas has increased significantly and will
            continue to increase into the future, with urban centers
            being the main driver of economic growth and transformation
            into higher value added activities. The highest rates of
            growth in population density are recorded in Uganda’s
            central region. It is essential that Uganda changes the
            manner in which it manages its land if the majority of its
            population is to achieve a higher level of prosperity
            through the healthy transformation of the agricultural
            sector and a shift towards higher value, more productive
            economic activities more generally. Through the formulation
            and implementation of smart policies, Uganda can ensure that
            its land serves as a more productive asset that facilitates
            positive transformation and a diversification of the
            economic base. The achievement of these goals will require a
            comprehensive set of actions that will promote security of
            land tenure and reduce the rate of occurrence of conflicts
            and disputes caused by overlapping rights; promote the
            healthy development of rental markets for land; and
            strengthen the capacities of institutions responsible for
            the management of land administration. Failure to unlock the
            potential of land may result in a deceleration of growth and
            lack of progress towards prosperity. In addition, rather
            than driving equitable economic growth, the process of
            urbanization will result in dysfunctionality in the form of
            the proliferation of slums; increased congestion; and a
            deterioration in the quality of, or a failure to develop,
            infrastructure due to an escalation in the costs of
            construction and payment of compensation. Implementation of
            relevant up to date laws and policies has to be accelerated
            to make land in Uganda genuinely secure, transferable,
            marketable and supportive of economic development.
