Credit And Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:                   Republic of Mali&#13;
Beneficiary:                Energie du Mali (EDM)&#13;
Credit Amount:              SDR 18-5 million (US$27.3 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                      Standard IDA, with 40 years maturity&#13;
On Lending Terms:           The Government would onlend to EDM US$26.1 million at a rate of&#13;
7.7% for 25 years, including a five-year grace period on the principal&#13;
repayments. EDM would bear the foreign exchange risk on the onlent&#13;
amount of the Credit. An amount of US$1.2 million equivalent (4.4% of&#13;
the Credit) to finance the Energy Efficiency Program and the preparation&#13;
of the long-term power sector institutional framework would be passed&#13;
on to EDM as a grant.&#13;
Project Objectives          Detailed inspections of the Selingue hydropower facility carried&#13;
and Description:            out in 1993 and 1994, highlighted important occurrences which exist in&#13;
particular in the earthen dikes of the dam. The main objective of the&#13;
project is to repair and rehabilitate these facilities to avoid: (a) an&#13;
important reduction in the generation capacity and its eventual stoppage;&#13;
and (b) any risk for the security of the population downstream. Other&#13;
objectives include: (a) maintaining electricity demand/supply balance by&#13;
increasing, marginally, the thermal capacity of the system, and&#13;
implementing an Energy Efficiency Program, (b) improving the capacity&#13;
of EDM to properly operate, maintain, and supervise its power&#13;
generation facilities; and (c) preparing the power sector  long-term&#13;
institutional and regulatory framework. The project would include: (a)&#13;
civil works for the Selingue dam (base cost: US$7.6 million); (b)&#13;
overhaul of the Selingue power plant and reinforcement of the thermal&#13;
generation capacity (base cost: US$25.4 million); (c) consultant services&#13;
for the supervision of works and various technical studies (base cost:&#13;
US$2.8 million); (d) training for EDM's staff (base cost: US$1.4 million);&#13;
and (e) materials, equipment and goods (base cost: US$3.3 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
Project Benefits:            The Selingue power plant provides 70% of the electricity supplied by&#13;
EDM. If this production ceases or is substantially reduced, all economic&#13;
activities in the country would be dramatically affected. The project will&#13;
prevent such a situation and will permit EDM, at a limited cost, to&#13;
preserve assets the value of which is estimated at more than US$300.0&#13;
million.&#13;
Project Risks:               Given the tight demand/supply balance over the next four years, the main&#13;
risk that could affect the proposed project implementation is related to&#13;
EDM's ability to carry out the rehabilitation project within its strict&#13;
schedule. However, this risk remains limited given that: (a) EDM's&#13;
experience in project implementation has been enhanced in the context of&#13;
the ongoing Power II Project; (b) EDM's overall management capacity is&#13;
expected to substantially improve under the Management Contract which&#13;
has been effective since January 1995.  Beyond 1999, when the&#13;
rehabilitation works are completed and the Management Contract is&#13;
finished, the sound technical operation, monitoring, and maintenance of&#13;
the Selingu6 facility will depend on the sustainability of the overall&#13;
improved management capacity of EDM and on EDM's financial&#13;
resources. The EDM training program and the new institutional and&#13;
regulatory framework preparation, which are part of the project, will&#13;
provide a basis to fulfill these conditions. It is also expected that, given&#13;
the financial restructuring plan of EDM adopted by the GOM in 1995,&#13;
the company will have sufficient resources to finance operation and&#13;
maintenance costs in the future.&#13;

1.    THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
1.1   Mali is one of the largest countries in Africa, with a surface area of 1.24 million km2.&#13;
The population is estimated at 9.5 million in 1994, with 80% living in rural areas. Of the eight&#13;
main cities in Mali, only the capital, Bamako, with a population of about 800,000 inhabitants,&#13;
is a major urban center. Mali is one of Africa's poorest countries, with a 1994 per capita&#13;
GDP of US$250. The economy is largely dependent on agriculture, which is the primary&#13;
source of income for most of the population and accounts for the largest share of product&#13;
exports (primarily cotton). During the last five years, the Government of Mali (GOM)&#13;
implemented a wide range of economic and sectoral policy reforms. The underlying objective&#13;
has been to improve the competitiveness of the economy and lay the foundation for the&#13;
sustained long-term growth needed to help raise the standard of living and alleviate poverty.&#13;
These reforms have removed bottlenecks to private sector participation allowing the market&#13;
forces to play a more important role in the determination of economic outcomes. The impact&#13;
of these reforms is shown by the improvement in economic performance over the adjustment&#13;
period. On January 12, 1994 the GOM, in consultation with the other member countries of&#13;
the CFA zone, decided to strengthen its adjustment strategy. The fixed parity of the CFA&#13;
Franc was changed from 50 to 100 CFAF per French Franc.&#13;
B.    Energy Resources and Consumption&#13;
1.2   Mali's domestic energy resources consist of biomass (fuelwood, charcoal, agricultural&#13;
and agro-industrial residues), hydro, and solar energy. Presently, only biomass for household&#13;
energy and hydro for electricity generation are exploited on a significant scale. The country's&#13;
hydroelectric potential, based on the Senegal and Niger river system, is estimated at about&#13;
1,000 MW capable of producing 5,000 GWh in an average year. Of this potential, only about&#13;
50 MW (220 GWh) have been developed so far, at the Selingue and Sotuba dams on the&#13;
Niger River. Mali has no significant known fossil fuels and petroleum product consumption is&#13;
entirely dependent on imports (about 200,000 tons annually).&#13;
1.3   Final energy consumption is low and was estimated in 1992 at 1.83 mnillion tons of oil&#13;
equivalent (toe). The energy balance for 1992 (Table 1) shows a consumption of 200 kg of&#13;
oil equivalent per capita per year. Fuelwood and charcoal represent more than 88% of the&#13;
consumption, whereas modern energy (petroleum products and electricity) represents less&#13;
than 12%. Households represent about 90% of the total final energy demand, one of the&#13;
world's highest relative shares. This indicates the low development of the modern economic&#13;
sector and the limited access of the agricultural sector to petroleum and electricity.&#13;

C.    Energy Sector Institutions and Policies&#13;
1.4    Responsibilities in the energy sector are distributed among various agencies and are&#13;
rather complex: (a) the Ministry for Rural Development and Environment (MDRE) is in&#13;
charge of managing Mali's forest resources and the supply of fuelwood; (b) petroleum&#13;
product importation and distribution are entirely controlled by private operators but are&#13;
regulated by the National Office for Petroleum Products (ONAP) under the supervision of the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and Trade (MFC); (c) hydrocarbon exploration is left to oil companies but&#13;
controlled by the Direction nationale de la geologie et des mines (DNGM), and (d) energy&#13;
sector planning is under the responsibility of the Direction nationale de l'hydraulique et de&#13;
l'energie (DNHE). These two departments (DNGM, DNHE) are part of the Ministry for&#13;
Mines, Energy, and Hydraulics (MM4EH).&#13;
1.5    The main objectives of the GOM  energy policy are: (a) to evaluate and develop&#13;
domestic energy resources, and (b) to promote more efficient utilization of all forms of&#13;
energy.   To achieve these objectives, the GOM  requested support from  the World&#13;
Bank/UNDP Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP). Two important&#13;
studies were subsequently carried out: an Energy Assessment (November 1991) and a&#13;
Household Energy Strategy (November 1992).&#13;
1.6   In 1991, the GOM decided to totally liberalize pump prices, and to adopt a simplified&#13;
system of tax collection at customs, incorporating into a single tax all of the previous taxation&#13;
components. These measures resulted in increased competition and eventually led to some&#13;
positive effects on petroleum production prices. However, this deregulated system needs to&#13;
be monitored more effectively by the Government. This is the main objective of the newly&#13;
created ONAP with particular emphasis on control of tax evasion, product quality and safety&#13;
at distribution points.&#13;
1.7    The new household energy policy is mainly based on: (a) for the supply side, the&#13;
rationalization of the transfer of the responsibility of the control and management of the&#13;
natural forests from the state to the local rural communities and the implementation of urban&#13;
woodfuel master plans and forest management plans; and (b) for the demand side, improving&#13;
how  household energy is utilized (revision of woodfuel pricing, interfuel substitution,&#13;
promotion of improved wood stoves, etc.). This strategy is currently being implemented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
under a Global Environment Fund (GEF) supported Household Energy Project, which was&#13;
approved in 1995-&#13;
II.    THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
A.    Power Sector Institutions and Organization&#13;
2.1   Until recently, the power sector was poorly organized with responsibilities divided&#13;
among several agencies. For example, the DNHE was in charge of planning and building&#13;
major power and water schemes and of technical supervision of the sector; Energie du Mali&#13;
(EDM) was the parastatal responsible for the operation and maintenance of most power and&#13;
urban water facilities, including those constructed by DNH-E; and the Office pour&#13;
1'exploitation des ressources hydrauliques du Haut Niger (OERHN), another parastatal&#13;
established in 1981, was responsible for the Selingue hydroelectric plant and for promoting&#13;
irrigation and fishery activities. All of the electricity generated at Selingue was sold by&#13;
OERHN to EDM. In addition to these agencies, the Organisation pour la mise en valeur du&#13;
fleuve Senigal (OMVS), the regional river authority for the Senegal Basin, was created in&#13;
1972 by Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal. This agency built the Manantali dam in western Mali&#13;
in 1988 to supply electricity to Mali, Senegal, and Mauritania.&#13;
2.2   This organization of the power sector led to several problems. These included: (a)&#13;
poor coordination between DNHE, OERHN, and EDM for investment planning and system&#13;
operation; (b) excessively high tariffs for the electricity sold by OERHN to EDM which&#13;
drained the power sector of important financial resources to subsidize other sectors; and (c)&#13;
poor operation and maintenance of the Selingue facility which contributed to the current&#13;
critical condition of the dam (para 4.2). To address these institutional problems several&#13;
actions where taken in beginning in 1988 and implemented, including the transfer of&#13;
responsibility to EDM of: (a) the operation of the Selingue power facility, under a&#13;
Management Contract with OERHN, and (b) the technical responsibility for planning and&#13;
operation of all power facilities with the exception of regional and multipurpose projects (e.g.,&#13;
Manantali Regional Energy Project). However, these measures were not sufficient and did&#13;
not address the need for eliminating the implicit subsidization of other sectors by the power&#13;
sector. In April 1993, the GOM decided to go one step further and transfer all of the Selingue&#13;
assets from OERHN to EDM. This decision materialized in September 1995 through a&#13;
concession agreement.&#13;
2.3.  In the long-term, the role of the state in the power sector will need to be revisited and&#13;
the institutional framework and regulation system revised to promote a rapid and sustainable&#13;
development of the sector and the access of a larger part of the population to electricity.&#13;
Under the proposed project, the Government will prepare and adopt a new institutional&#13;
framework based on studies and on systematic consultation with all of the stakeholders&#13;
including power consumers. This will include the redefinition of the State's role; the role of&#13;
the private participants in the power sector; and monopoly or competition between operators.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached that not later than three months prior to the mid-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
term review, in 1998, the GOM will furnish to IDA for its review an action plan for the&#13;
strengthening of the framework of the power sector and thereafter take all measures necessary&#13;
on its part for implementation of said action plan, taking into account IDA's comments (para&#13;
4.12 and 5.1)&#13;
B.    Existing Electricity Supply Facilities&#13;
2.4   The existing power network in Mali is shown on Map IBRD 27692. It comprises an&#13;
interconnected power system with a capacity of about 70 MW and 10 isolated centers totaling&#13;
10 MW. Detailed characteristics of existing facilities are provided in Annex 1. The Selingue&#13;
hydroelectric plant is by far the largest plant with an installed capacity of 44 MW and an&#13;
annual energy generation of about 180 GWh (Annex 2). In Bamako, EDM also operates two&#13;
plants, the Sotuba hydroelectric plant (5.2 MW, 39 GWh), and the Dar Salam diesel plant&#13;
with an installed capacity of 18 MW. The isolated centers are supplied by diesel units varying&#13;
in capacity from 35 kVA to 1,375 kVA, except for Kayes where the 500 kW Felou&#13;
hydroelectric plant supplies part of the demand. In the context of the ongoing Power II&#13;
Project, and through the financing from IDA (Credit 1998-MLI), Caisse frangaise de&#13;
developpement (CFD) and Kreditansalt fir Wierderbau (KfW) almost all of these thermal&#13;
plants have been rehabilitated and/or expanded, including the Dar Salam plant. Since 1993,&#13;
detailed inspections and studies have shown that the Selingue dam is in critical condition,&#13;
partly as a result of poor operation and maintenance practices (para 4.2). The proposed&#13;
project has been specifically designed to address these problems.&#13;
2.5   The transmission grid comprises 350 km of 150 kV lines (130 km from Selingue to&#13;
Bamako, 220 km from Bamako to Segou), 80 km of 66 kV line from Selingue to Yanfolila&#13;
and 175 km of 30-kV lines forming a loop around Bamako and also supplying the towns of&#13;
Koulikoro and Kalana. The transmission system is reasonably well maintained but its system&#13;
of electrical protection is in poor condition. A study was carried out in 1994, financed under&#13;
IDA credit 1998-MLI, to analyze possible improvements.  As a result, a comprehensive&#13;
US$3.1 million investment program was prepared and is part of the proposed project. In the&#13;
1980s, the distribution system (15 kV and low voltage lines and substations) in Bamako, as&#13;
well as in the isolated centers, was not adequately maintained or extended. This resulted in&#13;
the population's limited access to electricity, poor service reliability, and high energy losses&#13;
(22%). Under the ongoing Power II Project (Cr. 1998-MLI), important rehabilitation/&#13;
extension programs are being implemented to address these problems. As a result, major&#13;
improvements are foreseen in the near future in service reliability as well as a reduction in&#13;
energy losses, and a significant increase in the population's access to electricity.&#13;
C.    Access to Service and Electricity Demand&#13;
2.6   In 1994, EDM had about 59,000 customers of which about 78% were in the Bamako&#13;
area. About 44,000 are households but only 7% of the population has access to electricity&#13;
compared to 31,000 and 4% in 1988. Even in Bamako, the capital city, with about 42,000&#13;
customers, the electrification rate is only 40%. From 1987 to 1994, EDM's electricity sales&#13;
grew from 150 GWh to 209 GWh, with an average annual increase of 4.8% compared to 13%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
from 1981 to 1987, mainly because of supply limitations (generation capacity and distribution&#13;
network).  Demand studies (1993 tariff study, updated in 1995) show that there is&#13;
considerable potential for electricity use. However, the demand/supply balance will continue&#13;
to be tight over the next five years. Under the proposed project, the consumption growth rate&#13;
is expected to be at 5% per year in 1996 and 1997, and 8% per year from 1998 to 2000.&#13;
These figures result from an investment and rehabilitation program which will progressively&#13;
remove the supply-side bottleneck (para 2.7). Beyond the year 2000, the strategy for power&#13;
sector development and for increasing the access of the population to electricity would depend&#13;
on the timely completion of new large supply sources (Manantali Regional Energy Project and&#13;
the interconnection with the electrical system of C6te d'Ivoire). The forecast of electricity&#13;
consumption and generation up to 2005 is provided in Annex 3.&#13;
D.    Investment Program&#13;
2.7   EDM, with the assistance of consultants, developed a least cost expansion plan for the&#13;
Malian power system for the period 1995-2000. It includes: (a) the completion of the&#13;
rehabilitation and extension program of the Bamako distribution system and the isolated&#13;
centers, under the ongoing Power II Project, (b) the completion of the rehabilitation and&#13;
extension program of the generation systems in the isolated systems under the Power II&#13;
Project as well as under new CFD and KfW funded operations; (c) the addition of 9 MW of&#13;
thermal capacity from 1996 to 1997 under the proposed project. The immediate priority is&#13;
being given to repair/rehabilitate the country's main generation facility, at Selingue (paras 4.1&#13;
to 4.3). In the medium/long-term, after 1999/2000, the investments would consist of: (a) the&#13;
Manantali power facility (200 MW, 800 GWh out of which at least 300 GWh could be sold to&#13;
Mali); (b) the expansion of the transmission system (Manantali-Bamako; Segou-Sikasso-&#13;
Koutiala-Bougouni); and, possibly (c) the interconnection with the C6te d'Ivoire transmission&#13;
system. The total capital expenditure for the period 1995-2000 is estimated at US$161.0&#13;
million, excluding the Manantali Regional Energy Project. The detailed investment plan up to&#13;
the year 2000, and tentatively for the period 2000-2004, is provided in Annex 3.&#13;
E.    Energie du Mali (EDM)&#13;
Organization, Management and Staffing&#13;
2.8   EDM, established in 1961, is a semi-publicly owned enterprise with the GOM holding&#13;
the majority (97.2%) of the shares and Electricite de France (EDF) the remaining (2.8%)&#13;
shares. EDM is administered by a nine member board comprised of the Government (seven&#13;
members), EDF (one member) and EDM staff (one member). EDM has its own training&#13;
center (Centre de perfectionnement professionnel - CPP) and also sends staff for training to&#13;
the Ecole superieure interafricaine d VlectriciW (ESEE) and the Centre des metiers de&#13;
l 'dectricite (CME) in C6te d'Ivoire.&#13;
2.9   In spite of relatively important technical assistance programs during the past fifteen&#13;
years, EDM's management still needs some support. In April 1993, the GOM decided on a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
more drastic solution by contracting out the management of EDM to a private professional&#13;
partner for a period of four to five years (Delgation globale et temporaire de gestion -&#13;
DGG).  A  consortium  named SHEC, comprising Saur International, Hydro-Quebec&#13;
International (HQI), EDF and CRC Sogema, was selected and has been managing EDM&#13;
satisfactorily since January 1995. The fundamental objective is to enhance the management&#13;
capacity of EDM. Some important characteristics of this Management Contract are the&#13;
following: (a) it is a transitional solution until the GOM decides on and implements a new&#13;
regulation and institutional framework for the power sector (paras 2.2 and 2.3); and (b)&#13;
although all EDM's operational responsibilities have been entrusted to the private operator&#13;
(current operation as well as investment), the legal status of EDM and its ownership remain&#13;
unchanged.  To address EDM's immediate needs, strong emphasis was put on: (a)&#13;
streamlining procedures and management practices; and (b) upgrading EDM staffs&#13;
professionalism by implementing a comprehensive training program. The achievement of&#13;
these objectives will be evaluated on the basis of a financial and performance audit which will&#13;
be carried out at the end of 1996, and for the following two (or three) years, specific&#13;
measurable performance targets will be set up, and remuneration will be partially performance&#13;
based.&#13;
Accounting, Auditing, and Insurance&#13;
2.10  Until the end of 1994, EDM's accounting system was based, on accrual accounting&#13;
principles of the 1957 French Chart of Accounts. These principles have not been properly&#13;
followed because of EDM's technical and management weaknesses. Since January 1995,&#13;
EDM has been using the 1982 French Chart of Accounts.&#13;
2.11   Since 1984, EDM's accounts have been audited by independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
IDA. Because of the weaknesses indicated above, auditors have been unable to certify the&#13;
accounts and have consistently issued a disclaimer of opinion. One of the main and immediate&#13;
objectives of the Management Contract is to address this problem and have the FY96&#13;
accounts certified without qualification.&#13;
2.12  In 1994, with financing from IDA (Credit 1998-MNLl), a consulting firm carried out a&#13;
full inventory and revaluation of EDM's assets. The report was submitted at the end of 1994,&#13;
and EDM with the GOM is analyzing how to incorporate these results into its financial&#13;
statements without disruptive fiscal effects. One of the objectives of this revaluation of fixed&#13;
assets was to assess the adequacy of current insurance coverage and make corresponding&#13;
adjustments. According to the study, EDM maintains insurance coverage against regular&#13;
utility risks, but the insured amounts are insufficient.  Agreement was reached during&#13;
negotiations on: (a) annual audit of EDM's financial statements including the management&#13;
letter; and (b) pro-forma revaluation of fixed assets and corresponding adjustments in&#13;
insurance coverage (para 5.1).&#13;
&#13;

2.14   Financial indicators show  that EDM's financial performance improved steadily until&#13;
1993. In 1994 however, in spite of a 19% electricity tariff increase (para 2.15) which resulted&#13;
in increased revenues and operating income, EDM sustained important losses (CFAF 2.7&#13;
billion). Two combined factors explain this result: the 1994 devaluation of the CFA Franc and&#13;
the constitution by EDM of important provisions for doubtful receivables which were&#13;
previously underestimated. The January 1994 devaluation resulted in a 45% increase of fuel&#13;
costs and the doubling of the debt service (for which EDM bears the foreign exchange risks).&#13;
The amount of provisions made in 1994 for doubtful receivables was CFAF 3.8 billion&#13;
compared to CFAF 0.4 billion in 1993. Although EDM's current ratio appears reasonable, its&#13;
net working capital is tied up in customer receivables (CFAF 17 billion at the end of March&#13;
1995 representing about 7 months of billing). This has been one of the main reasons for&#13;
EDM's persistent liquidity problem.&#13;
EDM's Financial Restructuring Plan (1995 - 1998), Tariffs&#13;
2.15   EDM  charges uniform  electricity tariffs throughout the country.  The average tariff&#13;
level is CFAF 70/kWh (US$0.136/kWh). The last tariff increase occurred in February 1994&#13;
(19%), following a study carried out under the Power II Project. This increase, however, was&#13;
not sufficient to transfer the whole impact of the CFAF devaluation to the consumers. To&#13;
address this, a new financial restructuring plan was set up in October 1995. The objective is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
to provide, for the next four to five years, an orderly and reasonable solution, which would&#13;
limit tariff increases to the minimum required.&#13;
2.16  In this context the GOM  made the following decisions: (a) Selingue facility was&#13;
transferred to EDM as of January 1995 under a concession agreement, (b) some of EDM's&#13;
debt to the GOM was written off (US$30.0 million), (c) EDM's investments would be&#13;
exonerated of taxes and duties, at least during the entire period of the proposed project; and&#13;
(d) the electricity tariff levels would be increased by 9%, from CFAF 70/kWh to&#13;
CFAF 76/kWh by January 1998. This plan also takes into account substantial improvements&#13;
in EDM's management performance under the current Management Contract. These&#13;
improvements include a reduction in network losses from 22% to 16% in 1998 and a decrease&#13;
in EDM's receivables from 246 days in 1994 to 70 days in 1998.&#13;
EDM's Future Financial Performance&#13;
2.17   The above restructuring plan is expected to enable EDM to become profitable in 1995.&#13;
Table 3 shows that financial results would remain reasonable between 1995 and 1999 and&#13;
would improve beginning in the year 2000, once the Manantali power plant is constructed.&#13;
The net income would remain positive except in 1997 when it would be slightly negative. The&#13;
rate of return on rate base (average fixed assets) although decreasing to 2.2% in 1997, would&#13;
rise again after year 2000 to about 6 %. The debt service ratio would not be lower than 1.17&#13;
and is expected to return to over 1.3 after the year 2000. The self-financing ratio and the&#13;
current ratio would be satisfactory during the entire period of the project. The liquidity&#13;
position would also be satisfactory after 1997 when receivables would represent less than 90&#13;
days of billing. In the longer-term, it is expected that the purchase of energy from Manantali&#13;
would allow the tariff to remain stable in constant terms.&#13;
2.18   To protect EDM's future financial viability, agreement was reached  during&#13;
negotiations on: (a) the actual implementation of the financial restructuring plan (para 2.16),&#13;
in particular the 9% electricity tariff increase by January 1998; and (b) an annual review with&#13;
IDA of EDM's financial performance, tariff levels so as adjustment could be made to achieve&#13;
satisfactory financial results: (i) EDM will maintain a reasonable contribution - never below&#13;
10% - to its capital expenditures from internally-generated funds; (ii) EDM's future internally-&#13;
generated cash flows should represent at least 1. 1 future debt service; and (iii) EDM will&#13;
maintain the consumers arrears below ninety days of billing beginning in 1998 (para 5.1).&#13;
Salient features of EDM future finances are summarized in Table 3. EDM's Forecast Income,&#13;

Financing Plan&#13;
2.19    The  estimated  financing  requirements  of EDM, for the  period  1995-2000  total&#13;
US$161.0 million equivalent. EDM would be in a position to finance about 24 % (US$41.0&#13;
million) from  internally-generated resources.  The remaining, US$120.0 million, would have&#13;
to be funded from external sources. About US$50.0 million has already been secured under&#13;
ongoing projects including grants from KfW and the Canadian Agency for International&#13;
Development (ACDI) (para 2.7). Under the proposed project, IDA would provide US$27.3&#13;
niillion. EDM's financing requirements are summarized in the below.&#13;

Ill.   BANK GROUP ROLE IN THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
A.    History and Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement&#13;
3. 1   Bank assistance to the development of the Malian power sector began in 1979 with a&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance of US$0.97 million for preparatory studies. In&#13;
1983, a credit of US$24.0 million (Credit 1282-MILI) was approved to finance the First&#13;
Water/Power Project which included the first phase of the rehabilitation and extension of&#13;
EDM's electricity and water systems in Bamako, the rehabilitation of the Dar Salam diesel&#13;
plant, the construction of a new diesel plant at Mopti and technical assistance and training for&#13;
EDM's staff. The credit was closed on December 31, 1988.&#13;
3.2   In March 1989, another IDA credit of US$33.0 million was approved to support&#13;
financing of the Power II Project (Cr. 1998-MLI) which is still being implemented.  The&#13;
project includes the rehabilitation and extension of the existing generation, transmission, and&#13;
distribution systems in Bamako and the isolated centers. This project also included co-&#13;
financing of about US$52.0 million by other donors (CFD, Fonds d'aide el de cooperation -&#13;
FAC , ACDI, European Investment Bank - EIB, KfW, and African Development Bank -&#13;
AfDB). It was decided in April 1993 to restructure the project by transferring the Selingue&#13;
facility from OERHN to EDM and by contracting out the management of EDM to a private&#13;
firm. As a result, the project which was initially due to be completed in December 1995,&#13;
suffered delays that necessitated extending project implementation for two years.&#13;
B.    Rationale for IDA's Continued Involvement&#13;
3.3   IDA's involvement is necessary for the following reasons: (a) IDA has played and will&#13;
have to continue to play the role of a catalyst vis-a-vis the other donors in the power sector,&#13;
this was illustrated during the discussions/negotiations which led to the April 1993&#13;
restructuring decisions discussed above; these decisions, in turn, encouraged several donors to&#13;
extend financing to the sector; (b) the technical inspection of Selingue which led to the&#13;
proposed operation was carried out in the context of the ongoing IDA-supported Power II&#13;
Project (Cr. 1998-MLI); and (c) the results of the reforms which are being implemented (DGG&#13;
and Sector Unification) would be seriously compromised if the main generation capacity of&#13;
the country becomes totally or even partially unavailable. The proposed project is part of the&#13;
Mali Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) approved by the Board in January 1995 which&#13;
includes the rehabilitation and the maintenance of basic infrastructures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
IV.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
4.1   The hydroelectric dam of Selingue, commissioned in 1980, is located on the Sankarani&#13;
river, a tributary of the Niger river. Its construction was financed by Arab donors, CFD,&#13;
AfDB, FED, KfW and FAC for US$140.0 million. The main facilities include: (a) a dam&#13;
consisting of two earthen dikes totaling 2,600 meters in length and 23 meters in height and a&#13;
334 meters long concrete dam between the dikes; a spillway flood with a maximum release&#13;
capacity of 3,600 m3/s, and a reservoir of about 2 billion m3; (b) the power plant which&#13;
comprises four 11.9 MW units; and (c) a single circuit 150 kV transmission line of 130 km&#13;
from Selingue to Bamako. The annual average production is approximately 180 GWh&#13;
representing over 70% of EDM's current electricity supply.&#13;
4.2   As part of the ongoing Power II Project, a detailed technical inspection was carried&#13;
out in 1993 by an engineering firm. This study concluded that: (a) the monitoring of the&#13;
different components of the dam and the power plant was inadequate and most of the&#13;
auscultation equipment was out of service; and (b) some important deficiencies exist, both in&#13;
the civil and electromechanical facilities. Additional studies were needed and carried out from&#13;
mid-1993 to December 1994 to analyze the nature and the origin of the occurrences and to&#13;
design remedial measures accordingly. These studies confirmed that worrisome phenomena&#13;
were taking place regarding the earth dikes and in particular, that there was some seepage&#13;
through the right abutment of the dike and through the dike itself. The experts indicated that&#13;
this was a slow phenomenon, but that if not properly addressed, it could result in a sudden&#13;
internal collapse of the dam and provoke a large failure in the dike. This would subsequently&#13;
result in the loss of Mali's main power facility and possibly place the security of people living&#13;
downstream at risk. During negotiations agreements was reached that an annual inspection of&#13;
the dam will be carried out by qualified and independent experts and reports will be submitted&#13;
to IDA (para 5.1).&#13;
4.3   The studies also concluded that: (a) there is an urgent need for a systematic overhaul&#13;
of all electromechanical equipment; and (b) the transmission equipment component, although&#13;
in relatively good condition, needs some maintenance and improvements (especially for&#13;
electrical protection of the system). Inadequate and unclear sharing of responsibilities over&#13;
the Selingue facility, involving OERHN  and EDM, resulted in poor monitoring and&#13;
maintenance of the main asset of the Malian power sector. The decision made by GOM to&#13;
transfer all Selingue assets from OERHN to EDM will clarify these responsibilities and&#13;
address this shortcoming.&#13;
B.    Project Objectives and Scope&#13;
4.4   The main objective of the project is to repair and rehabilitate the Selingue facility to&#13;
ensure that the major source of electricity supply is not destroyed. Other objectives of the&#13;
project are to: (a) maintain the electricity demand-supply balance by increasing, the thermal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
capacity of the system and implementing art energy efficiency program; (b) improve the&#13;
capacity of EDM to properly operate, maintain, and supervise its power generation facilities;&#13;
and (c) prepare a long-term institutional framework and regulatory system for the power&#13;
sector and implement it as of 1999.  To monitor the completion of these objectives,&#13;
performance indicators have been established and are detailed in Annex 9&#13;
C.    Project Description&#13;
4.5   The proposed project consists of the following components which are described in&#13;
detail in Annex 6. Map IBRD-27692 shows the location of the facility whose rehabilitation&#13;
works are financed under the proposed project.&#13;
Component A: Rehabilitating Selingue Hydropower Facility&#13;
4.6   Dam. This includes urgent remedial and rehabilitation works actions for: (a) the&#13;
embankment dam (embankment crest, embankment right bank, and the road superstructure);&#13;
(b) the concrete structures such as the powerhouse, the spillway, galleries and drainage&#13;
systems; additional drilling and piezometer holes to check the foundation and embankment&#13;
dam; and (c) the improvement of monitoring devices and instrumentation. These works are to&#13;
be completed by the end of 1997. Estimated base cost: US$6.7 million.&#13;
4.7   Power plant. This includes: (a) repairs of some general powerhouse equipment&#13;
(measurement and control devices, filtering and cooling systems); and (b) the overhaul of the&#13;
four generators (turbines, alternators, voltage and speed regulation, and monitoring systems);&#13;
one unit would be repaired per annum from 1996 to 2000. Estimated base cost: US$11.4&#13;
rmLillion.&#13;
4.8   Transmission system. This includes: (a) a comprehensive restructuring of the&#13;
electrical protection system for the 150 kV, 30 kV, and 15 kV system; (b) the procurement of&#13;
spare parts and maintenance, by EDM, of the Selingue-Bamako transmission 150 kV line and&#13;
substations, and (c) a feasibility study of a dispatching center for the interconnected Malian&#13;
system. Estimated base cost: US$4.8 million.&#13;
Component B: Maintain the Demand /Supply Balance&#13;
4.9   Thermal capacity. Before the Manantali Regional Energy Project is completed, an&#13;
additional capacity of 9 MW is needed to maintain the demand/supply balance and provide&#13;
back-up during periods of reduced supply from Selingue. Small diesel units of about I MW&#13;
capacity each will be added to the interconnected system with the objective to later relocate&#13;
them to supply small isolated centers. Estimated base cost: US$8. I million.&#13;
4.10  Energy efficiency program. This component will also contribute to maintaining the&#13;
demand/supply balance. It includes: (a) the purchase and installation of small equipment for&#13;
reducing distribution network technical losses; (b) the identification of existing captive power&#13;
capacities and negotiation of purchase contracts by EDM; and (c) the design and promotion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
end-use efficiency programs (efficient light bulbs, humidifiers, interruptible tariffs for the few&#13;
largest customers, and specific measures for the administrative buildings). Estimated base&#13;
cost: US$0.8 million.&#13;
Component C: Strengthening EDM's Management Capacity&#13;
4.11   EDM's management capacity. This includes: (a) a specific training program to&#13;
improve the capacity of EDM staff to operate and properly maintain generation facilities,&#13;
specifically at Selingue, (b) studies for preparing future power sector development programs;&#13;
and (c) acquisition of equipment, computer software and other items. Estimated base cost:&#13;
US$2.0 million.&#13;
Component D: Long-Term Institutional Framework&#13;
4.12  Long-term institutional framework. The objective is to set up a new institutional&#13;
framework, for a rapid and sustainable development of the power sector in Mali. A detailed&#13;
schedule and organization for this component are provided in Annex 7. The GOM will set up&#13;
a steering committee of two to three members responsible for: (a) organizing a systematic&#13;
stakeholders consultation, before March 1997; (b) analyzing in-depth, questions, needs, and&#13;
propositions raised during this first phase, and (c) proposing and discussing decisions to be&#13;
taken by the Government by mid-1998. Under this component, IDA will finance consultant&#13;
services as well as some office equipment. Estimated base cost: US$0.4 million.&#13;
D.    Project Cost&#13;
4.13  The total cost of the project is estimated at US$42.1 million equivalent, net of taxes&#13;
and duties including interest during construction and contingencies, with a foreign exchange&#13;
component of US$36.8 million (87%).&#13;
4.14  Cost estimates are based on June 1995 prices, with an average of 12% added for&#13;
physical contingencies, varying by the kind of expenditure from 5% to 15% of the estimated&#13;
base cost. Price escalation is estimated at 2.6 % per year and is based on the evolution of the&#13;
MUV index (Unit Value Index of Manufactured Exports). The local inflation rate is based on&#13;
the most recent estimates made by International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank staff&#13;
(8% in 1995, 3.5% in 1996, 2.5% thereafter). The physical contingencies include two main&#13;
unavoidable uncertainties of the project: (a) for each alternator to be overhauled, the cost of&#13;
repairs may vary from US$0.5 million to US$1.5 million, depending on the need for rewiring&#13;
the altemator, which would be known only when it is dismantled; and (b) the civil works&#13;
component includes repairs on the embankment right bank where the proposed technical&#13;
solution for treatment makes a distinction between stage/zone A (near the dam) and&#13;
stage/zone B (ffirther away); the need to carry out the stage B can only be assessed once stage&#13;
A is completed. Depending on these uncertainties, the total base cost for the repairs of the&#13;
dam and the power plant is estimated at US$21.7 million but may vary from US$18.2 million&#13;
to US$24.5 million. As part of the required financial restructuring plan of EDM, the GOM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
decided to exempt the project from taxes and duties which are estimated at US$6.5 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
E. Project Financing&#13;
4.15  IDA will provide a US$27.3 million credit (65% of the total project cost) of which the&#13;
Government will onlend US$26.1 million to EDM at a rate of 7.7% for 25 years, including a&#13;
five-year grace period). EDM will bear the foreign exchange risk on the onlent amount of the&#13;
Credit. An amount of US$1.2 million equivalent (4.4% of the Credit) to finance the Energy&#13;
Efficiency Program and the preparation of the long-term power sector institutional framework&#13;
will be presented to EDM as a grant. The signature of a subsidiary financial agreement&#13;
between GOM and EDM will be a condition of credit effectiveness (para 5.2). EDM will&#13;
contribute an amount of US$8.3 million from internally generated resources. In parallel, the&#13;
European Investment Bank (EIB) will provide US$6.5 million to help finance the addition of 9&#13;
MW of thermal capacity. The project will be exempt from taxes and duties estimated to be&#13;
US$6.5 million. The GOM and EDM will assume responsibility for any cost overruns.&#13;
F.    Project Preparation and Implementation&#13;
4.16  The project was prepared in 1994/1995 with the assistance of German, Belgian, and&#13;
Malian consultants financed under the ongoing Power II Project (Cr. 1998-MLI). In addition,&#13;
an independent reputable expert in civil works engineering has been recruited by EDM and&#13;
financed by Credit 1998-MLI, to assist with the review of the civil engineering components of&#13;
these studies, confirm that the proposed solutions are technically sound, and continue to&#13;
provide EDM with expertise during the implementation of the repairs. EDM would implement&#13;
all aspects of the proposed project, and will benefit from the permanent support of the private&#13;
management consortium which is managing EDM since January 1995. The long-term&#13;
institutional framework component would be closely supervised by MMEH. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached on the following: (a) the Project Implementation Plan&#13;
(PIP); and (b) unless EDM and the Association shall otherwise agree, EDM will employ under&#13;
a management contract an independent professional firm to manage its operations, throughout&#13;
project implementation (para 5.1). Project completion is expected by December 31, 2000.&#13;
The detailed implementation schedule is provided in Annex 8.&#13;
G.   Procurement&#13;
4.17  Table 5 below summarizes the project costs by procurement methods. The Malian&#13;
procurement code was revised in 1995 in consultation with the Bank and is generally sound.&#13;
For ICB, procurement will be carried out in agreement with the Bank's guidelines for&#13;
procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits (January 1995) and the Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents (January 1995 or the latest version) for civil works, supply and&#13;
installation, and goods will be used. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) advertised locally&#13;
will be carried out in accordance with local procedures acceptable to IDA, provided that: (a)&#13;
bidders are given sufficient time to submit bids (three to four weeks for contracts exceeding&#13;
US$25,000 equivalent), (b) bid evaluation and bidder qualification criteria are clearly specified&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
in bidding documents; (c) no preference margin is granted to domestic contractors or&#13;
manufacturers, (d) eligible foreign firms are not precluded from participation; (e) contracts&#13;
provide for security in an amount sufficient to protect the borrower in case of breach of&#13;
contract (without distinction or exception), (f) prior to issuing the first call for bids, draft&#13;
standard bidding documents are submitted to IDA and found acceptable; and (g) the award&#13;
will be made to the lowest evaluated bidder.&#13;
4.18   The majonrty of the proposed Credit (US$22.1  million or 81%), will be used to&#13;
procure civil works, supply and installation, and goods under ICB. Bidding documents were&#13;
already reviewed by IDA and the procurement process is at an advanced stage. Major&#13;
contracts award is expected at time of credit effectiveness.&#13;

4.19   Civil works contract (US$7.6  million) relate to  the repairs/rehabilitation  of the&#13;
Selingue dam. Supply and Installation contracts (US$15.7 million) relate to: (a) the repairs of&#13;
the power plant; and (b) the repairs of the transmission system electrical protections. All&#13;
contracts could be procured through ICB. For the Selingue dam and power plant repairs,&#13;
prequalification of contractors was considered necessary and was launched in October 1995,&#13;
in consultation with IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
4.20  Contracts for Goods (totaling US$2.3 million) related to spare parts supply for the&#13;
Selingue-Bamako transmission line would be procured through ICB. Contracts for office&#13;
equipment and materials locally available costing less than US$100,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract would be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA, provided the&#13;
aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed US$0.5 million equivalent. Small&#13;
quantities of goods such as office supplies, consumable materials and spare parts, which are&#13;
normally available off-the-shelf would be procured through prudent international and local&#13;
shopping based on price quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers, provided&#13;
that: (a) these goods cannot be grouped into packages of at least US$40,000 for local&#13;
shopping and US$50,000 for international shopping, and (b) the aggregate amount does not&#13;
exceed US$150,000 for local shopping and US$250,000 for international shopping. A few&#13;
items of a proprietary nature for project components A and B may be purchased directly from&#13;
the manufacturer for an aggregate estimated amount of US$100,000.&#13;
4.21   Consulting Services contracts financed by IDA (totaling US$4.2 million) include: (a)&#13;
the supervision of civil works and electromechanical repairs for the Selingue hydropower&#13;
facilities; (b) training services, and (c) studies, audits, and short-term specialists as needed.&#13;
Contracts would be awarded in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August&#13;
1981). Recruitment of the engineering firm for supervision is to be completed by May 1996.&#13;
A detailed list of the consultant contracts is provided in Annex 6.&#13;
4.22 Review by IDA. All IDA-financed contracts above a threshold value of US$100,000&#13;
(US$50,000 for individual consultant) will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures.&#13;
Contracts below the specified threshold will be subject to ex-post review and documentation&#13;
for such contracts will be maintained by the borrower for ex-post review by auditors and by&#13;
Bank supervision missions. The exception to prior review of consultant contracts will not&#13;
apply to the terms of reference for such contracts, to single-source hiring, to assignment of a&#13;
critical nature (as determined by IDA), and to amendments to contracts raising their value&#13;
above these thresholds (US$100,000 and US$50,000 respectively).&#13;
4.23    Procurement Arrangements. Under the two previous IDA-financed projects, EDM&#13;
already gained experience in the Bank's procedures. It will also benefit from the permanent&#13;
support of the private management firm which is in charge of EDM administration.&#13;
Procurement would be managed by EDM with the assistance of an engineering firm (for civil&#13;
works and electromechanical works), the current consulting engineer and ad hoc short-term&#13;
specialists as required including a procurement specialist hired by EDM for project&#13;
implementation. A detailed procurement plan for works, goods, and services to be procured&#13;
under the project was prepared and is provided in Annex 8. It will be updated on a regular&#13;
basis. During implementation, all bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and draft&#13;
contracts transmitted to IDA for review will contain an updated copy of the procurement plan.&#13;
To ensure a timely project implementation process, EDM will take the necessary measures to&#13;
ensure that procurement phases do not exceed the following target time periods:&#13;

H.    Disbursements&#13;
4.24   The proposed project is expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 2000 in&#13;
accordance with the estimated schedule in Annex 8. To facilitate project implementation,&#13;
during negotiations agreement was reached that EDM will open a Special Account in a&#13;
commercial bank with an authorized allocation of US$750,000 equivalent with US$500,000 at&#13;
the beginning of the project until the related cumulative expenditures for categories covered&#13;
by the Special Account reach US$1.5 million (para 5.1). The account will be used to pay for&#13;
eligible expenditures financed by IDA. It will be replenished on a monthly basis or when it is&#13;
reduced by one-third, whichever comes first. Disbursement of the IDA credit will be fully&#13;
documented except for contracts valued at less than US$100,000 (US$50,000 for individual&#13;
consultant contract) which will be disbursed against statements of expenditures (SOEs). All&#13;
IDA expenditures of less than US$100,000 equivalent will be paid from the Special Account.&#13;
The proposed IDA credit will be disbursed as follows:&#13;

Accounting, Auditing, Monitoring, and Reporting&#13;
4.25   EDM  will have the overall responsibility for the accounting, monitoring, and reporting&#13;
of the project including the component implemented under the MMEH supervision. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached that these accounts will be audited annually (para 5.1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
All audits will be conducted according to international auditing standards and independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to IDA. The audited accounts, including the management letter will be&#13;
submitted to IDA within six months following the end of the fiscal year while SOEs will be&#13;
reviewed by IDA on a regular basis. The accounting system will be the same the one being&#13;
used under the ongoing Power II Project, which is satisfactory to IDA. EDM has already&#13;
signed a contract with an audit firm, acceptable for IDA, for 1995. This firm will also carry&#13;
out the audits for the proposed project.&#13;
4.26  To monitor the achievement of project objectives, performance indicators have been&#13;
set up and are detailed in Annex 9. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the&#13;
performance indicators. As part of the project reporting, agreement was also reached on the&#13;
submission by EDM to IDA of: (a) quarterly progress reports on project implementation; (b)&#13;
copies of all consultants' reports or studies financed under the proposed credit, and (c) a&#13;
project implementation completion report within six months of the project completion (para&#13;
5.1).&#13;
4.27  A mid-term review of the project will take place in 1998.  During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that this review will focus on: (a) the implementation of the project&#13;
and the environmental mitigation plan of the dam; (b) the Management Contract performance;&#13;
and (c) the Government's proposal for the power sector institutional framework to be&#13;
implemented after 1999 (para 5. 1).&#13;
I.    Environment&#13;
4.28 The project will have a positive effect on the environment since it aims at: (a) repairing&#13;
and rehabilitating a deteriorating structure and strengthening the security of the dam; and (b)&#13;
contributing to maintaining Mali's hydroelectric energy capacity thus reducing the amount of&#13;
electricity generated by thermal units. The project is rated B.&#13;
4.29  An assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed rehabilitation works has&#13;
been carried out and a mitigation plan was prepared. The possible negative consequences are&#13;
minor; they relate to: (a) possible lubricant spills when the electromechanical units are&#13;
removed from the powerhouse for rehabilitation; and (b) the creation of stagnant pools in the&#13;
quarries which would provide materials for the civil works. Mitigation measures were&#13;
prepared and are part of the contractors' obligations (Annex 10). During negotiations&#13;
agreement was reached on the actual implementation of this environmental mitigation&#13;
measures (para 5. 1).&#13;
4.30  During project preparation, an in-depth study of the environmental impact of the dam&#13;
since its construction, was undertaken. This study relied on a broad consultation of the&#13;
populations living in the Selingue area and on existing monitoring data form OERHN and the&#13;
Institut national de recherche en sante publique (INRSP). It revealed a noticeable positive&#13;
impact, in particular on the development of agriculture and fishing in surrounding areas. The&#13;
study also showed that the construction of the Selingue dam has had negative impacts and that&#13;
despite the initial mitigation plan which was prepared and implemented in the early 1980s,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
there are still problems which need to be addressed, such as malaria and schistosomiasis in&#13;
some surrounding areas. As a conclusion, the study proposed an action plan to mitigate these&#13;
remaining problems. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the GOM and EDM, in&#13;
consultation with all concerned entities, and with Bank assistance, will finalize this action plan&#13;
and implement it from the beginning of 1997 (para 5. 1; Annex 1 1).&#13;
J.    Project Justification and Benefits&#13;
4.31   Repairs of the Selingue dam. Electricity supply is of vital importance to any&#13;
country's economy. The Selingue power plant provides 70% of EDM's electricity. If this&#13;
production ceases or is substantially reduced, all economic activities will be dramatically&#13;
affected and may ultimately lead to a major crisis. The proposed project would prevent such a&#13;
situation and permit at a limited costs, the preservation of assets the value of which is&#13;
estimated at more than US$300.0 million. It would also avoid to place the security of people&#13;
living downstream at risk.&#13;
4.32  The experts recommended that the repairs be undertaken immediately and that until&#13;
June 1997, the maximum level of the reservoir be limited at 348.0 meters instead of a normal&#13;
level of 348.5 meters. If the dam is not repaired, it will not be possible to go any further with&#13;
the exploitation of the dam, even at a limited capacity. The alternative to rehabilitating the&#13;
Selingue dam would be to abandon it and drain off the reservoir. The energy supply over the&#13;
next 30 years (estimated economic remaining life time for the dam) would have to come from&#13;
alternative sources. These could be: (a) a full thermal substitution (estimated cost US$185.0&#13;
million); or (b) a temporary thermal substitution from 1996 to 2000 which would then be&#13;
replaced by energy purchased from the Manantali dam (estimated cost US$115.0 million). As&#13;
shown below, these alternatives are three to four times more expensive than the proposed&#13;
S&amp;lingue rehabilitation project and the proposed project is thus the least cost option.&#13;
Production Cost per kWh                      In US$&#13;
(calculated over the next 30 years)&#13;
- Selingue (proposed project + operational and maintenance costs)   0.029&#13;
- Full thermal substitution                                          0.10&#13;
- Temporary thermal substitution and Manantali purchase              0.06&#13;
4.33  If the dam is not repaired, the cost of the electricity which would not be produced is&#13;
estimated at US$22.0 million per year. On this basis alone, the Economic Rate of Return&#13;
(ERR) on the Selingue rehabilitation, including the 3 MW of thermal back up, is estimated at&#13;
66%. This high return is not surprising since this is primarily a rehabilitation and not an&#13;
investment project.   The Net Present Value (NPV) of the project amounts to&#13;
US$126.0 million.&#13;
4.34  The best timing for undertaking the works was also carefully assessed, except for civil&#13;
works repairs which are urgently needed for security reasons. The proposed timing for the&#13;
overhaul of the electromechanical parts is from 1996 to 1999 (one unit each year). The&#13;
comparison was made with a scenario in which these works are postponed until after the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
completion of the Manantali project, in the year 2000. This comparison yields an Equalizing&#13;
Discount Rate (EDR) of 39%. If the delay is only one year, the EDR would be 21%. Detailed&#13;
assumptions and calculations are provided in Annex 6.&#13;
4.35  Addition of the thermal units. EDM plans to purchase 9 MW of thermal capacity of&#13;
which 3 MW are necessary as back-up during the rehabilitation of the Selingue generating&#13;
units. If the remaining 6 MW were not installed, important outages would occur each year&#13;
during the peak season until the completion of the Manantali power plant, and EDM will not&#13;
be able to supply any additional demand. The only alternative for EDM customers would be&#13;
to get electricity from small individual diesel generation units at an estimated cost of&#13;
US$0.60/kWh. Based on these costs, the ERR for the additional 6 MW thermal units is about&#13;
65%. Detailed assumptions are provided in Annex 6.&#13;
4.36  Repairs of the transmission network electrical protections. Another component in&#13;
the project consists of rehabilitating the electrical protections of the transmission network&#13;
(cost US$3.1 million). This equipment, which is the core of the electric system is in poor&#13;
condition and is responsible for low quality service. There is no other alternative than to&#13;
proceed with its rehabilitation.&#13;
K.   Project Risks and Sensitivity Analyses&#13;
4.37  Given the tight demand/supply balance over the next four years, there is a risk of&#13;
important load shedding during the periods of reduced supply from Selingue. To avoid this&#13;
risk, the rehabilitation works schedule (one out of four units overhauled each year) must be&#13;
strictly respected. This is likely to be the case as: (a) EDM's experience in project&#13;
implementation has been enhanced in the context of the ongoing Power II Project, and (b)&#13;
EDM's overall management capacity is expected to considerably improve under the five-year&#13;
Management Contract.&#13;
4.38  Beyond 1999, when the rehabilitation works are completed and the Management&#13;
Contract has come to an end, the sound technical operation, monitoring, and maintenance of&#13;
the Selingue facilities will depend on the sustainability of the overall improved management&#13;
capacity of EDM  and on EDM's financial resources.  The training program  and the&#13;
preparation of the new institutional and regulatory framework, which are part of the proposed&#13;
project, have been designed to enable EDM to carry out these tasks efficiently.&#13;
4.39   Sensitivity of the ERR to cost variations: Depending on the uncertainties on some&#13;
repairs to be undertaken, the cost of the Selingue rehabilitation works might increase from&#13;
US$21.7 million to US$24.5 million. With this new figure, the ERR of the Selingue&#13;
rehabilitation would decrease from 66% to 56%.&#13;
4.40  Sensitivity of the ERR to delays in the works schedule: The rehabilitation work for&#13;
each power generating unit is planned to last nine months. If the work were to take, instead,&#13;
one full year, additional thermal generation would be needed and this would result in a&#13;
decrease of the ERR from 66% to 61%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;

Mali&#13;
Selingue Power Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Selingue Power Plant&#13;
Description of Selingue Facilities&#13;
1.    The Selingue scheme on the Sankarani River, a tnbutary of the upper Niger River was built in&#13;
1980 for multipurpose usage including: (a) about 130,000 acres of fertile land irrigation. (b) power&#13;
generation; (c) improvement of navigation on the Niger River by flood regulation; and (d) promotion&#13;
of fishery.&#13;
2.    The storage reservoir, formed by an earth homogeneous dam of nearly 2,200 m length and a&#13;
maximum height of 23m has a total capacity of 2,170 million m3 (usable 1,930 million m3). The power&#13;
plant and the spillway are located in a concrete gravity structure, about 334m long in the middle of the&#13;
earth dam. The power plant is equipped with four Kaplan turbines of 11.9 MW each. The thousand-&#13;
year flood of 3,500m3/s is discharged by a spillway with eight 13 x 5 m flap gates.&#13;
3.    The average annual energy generation is 180 GWh and is transmitted to Bamako and the&#13;
interconnected gnd through a 130 km long 150 kV transmission line.&#13;
4.    To compensate for the cultural losses of the people being driven out by the dam, a 3,700 acres&#13;
irrigation scheme was implemented downstream on the right bank. The dam includes auxiliary&#13;
facilities capable of supplying an imrgation flow of 2 x 3 m3/s to the irrigation feeder canal for the&#13;
whole area.&#13;
Works Schedule&#13;
5.    The key dates of construction and equipment installation were the following:&#13;
- November 1976: Start up of civil works on site&#13;
- December 1979: Installation of the first turbine&#13;
- February  1980: Diversion of river flow through the concrete structures&#13;
- August   1980: Operation of the first unit&#13;
- July     1981: Operation of all facilities&#13;
Financing plan and contractors&#13;

Past and present situation&#13;
7.    In November 1989, a consulting firrn was appointed for a limited technical inspection of the&#13;
dam. In August 1992, the same firm was contracted to carry out a comprehensive decennal check-up of&#13;
the dam. The final report was produced in July 1993.&#13;
8.    This inspection  revealed  that important deficiencies exist, both  in the civil and&#13;
electromechanical facilities. A preoccupying detenroration since the previous inspection in 1989 was&#13;
reported. The conclusion now is that if these problems are not quickly addressed, they may result in&#13;
serious and, in certain cases, irreversible detenroration of the equipment: dikes, turbines, and&#13;
alternators.&#13;
9.     The monitoring equipment of the dam and the power station is either inadequate or out of&#13;
service. High voltage equipment in the Selingue and Balingue substations are also in critical condition.&#13;
The four Slimgue units operated for over 75,000 hours which far exceeds the limit requiring a&#13;
comprehensive overhaul. Auscultation equipment of the dikes is out of service and the surveillance of&#13;
the dam no longer exists.&#13;
10.   The consultant concluded that the Selingue dam is at a critical stage and if a full overhaul is&#13;
not quickly carried out, the cost of rehabilitation would be extremely high. An action plan was prepared&#13;
by EDM and resulted in the present proposed project.&#13;

2.    The above financial indicators show that EDM's financial performance improved steadily&#13;
until 1993. EDM sustained losses of CFAF 1.374 billion in 1991 and CFAF 1.465 billion in 1992.&#13;
Following a substantial tariff increase for water (32%) in July 1993, EDM recorded a net income&#13;
of CFAF 241 million in 1993 (profit of CFAF 844 million for electricity activities and a loss of&#13;
CFAF 603 million for water activities). In 1994 however, in spite of a 19% electricity tariff&#13;
increase which resulted in increased revenues and operating income, EDM sustained important&#13;
losses (CFAF 2.7 billion shared between electricity activities - CFAF 1.9 billion - and water&#13;
activities - CFAF 0.8 billion). Two combined factors explain this result: the 1994 devaluation of&#13;
the CFA Franc and the constitution by EDM of important provisions for doubtful receivables&#13;
which were previously underestimated. The January 1994 devaluation resulted in a 45% increase&#13;
of fuel costs and the doubling of the debt service (for which EDM bears the foreign exchange&#13;
risks). The amount of provisions made in 1994 for doubtful receivables was CFAF 3.8 billion&#13;
compared to CFAF 0.4 billion in 1993.&#13;
3.    The rate base on two-year average net fixed assets increased from CFAF 28 billion in&#13;
1993 to CFAF 44 billion in 1994. This increase is due to the recording in 1994 in EDM's books&#13;
of the value water facilities never posted and the inclusion in 1994 in the fixed assets of foreign&#13;
exchange losses (CFAF 15.8 billion in borrowings).&#13;
4.    Although EDM's current ratio appears to be reasonable, its net working capital is tied up&#13;
in customers receivable (CFAF 17 billion at the end of March 1995 representing about 7 months&#13;
of billing). This is one of the main reasons for EDM's continuing liquidity problems.&#13;

5.    Projections are made in current terms. The following inflation rates are assumed:&#13;
Years                     Local                      Foreign&#13;
1995                      8.0                   2.6 (whole period)&#13;
1996                      3.5&#13;
1997-2004                      2.5&#13;
Operating Income&#13;
6.    Energy sales are detailed in Annex 3 (interconnected network). In 1994, EDM  sold&#13;
209 GWh and the average tariff was CFAF 69.8/kWh. Over the period 1994-2004, it is estimated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
that the demand would grow at an average rate of 8% per year. For the interconnected network,&#13;
the demand growth would reach 5% in 1996 and 1997, 8% per year from 1998 to 2000 and 10%&#13;
thereafter. Other revenues would increase at 11 % per annum.&#13;
Operating Expenses&#13;
7.    Until the end of 1994, electricity purchased from OERHN was charged to EDM at an&#13;
average cost of CFAF 24.3/KWh. Since January 1995, Selingue facilities have been transferred&#13;
to EDM (assets as well as corresponding debts service) and EDM is no longer buying electricity&#13;
from OERHN.&#13;
8.    It is assumed that beginning in the year 2000, EDM will purchase electricity from OMVS&#13;
to substitute for the production of the Dar Salam thermal plant. The purchase price has been&#13;
estimated at CFAF 25/kWh.&#13;
9.    Fuel costs are estimated on the basis of current costs and generation forecasts are as&#13;
shown in Annex 3. Specific consumptions in 1994 were as follows:&#13;
Bamako             235 gr/kWh&#13;
Isolated Centers   260 gr/kWh&#13;
During the projection period, average fuel price are supposed unchanged:&#13;
Fuel oil (0.87)    163CFAF /L&#13;
Gasoil (0.83)      260CFAF /L&#13;
10.   Materials include consumption of non-fuel oil, such as gasoline, lube oil, spare parts and&#13;
have been increased with 10% per annum after 1996.&#13;
11.   From 1995 to 1999, the cost of the Management Contract is included in the fixed assets&#13;
and depreciated over a period of five years. The annual cost is shared proportionally by electricity&#13;
and water sectors revenues.&#13;
12.   Personnel costs were increased by 10% in 1995 to take into account the portion of&#13;
OERHN's staff who were transferred to EDM and projected thereafter according to the number&#13;
of customers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
13.   Interest during construction is capitalized. Depreciation is based on the historic value of&#13;
fixed assets. Following the January 1994 devaluation of the CFA Franc, EDM revalued its foreign&#13;
currency loans at the end of 1994 at the prevailing rates. However, since EDM's debt linked to&#13;
CFD loans were canceled by the GOM, adequate adjustments have been posted in the 1995&#13;
accounts. The depreciation average rate is 4.5% of average gross fixed assets in operation.&#13;
Provisions for renewal of fixed assets financed by customers are estimated at 3.3% of the average&#13;
gross fixed assets in operation.&#13;
14.   In accordance with income tax regulations, the income tax is the highest of (a) 45% of the&#13;
operating income; or (b) 0.75% of total revenues.&#13;
Balance Sheets&#13;
15.   Gross fixed assets are increased by transfers from works in progress. In line with the&#13;
electricity sector unification, OERHN's fixed assets and the corresponding remaining debts were&#13;
transferred (on the basis of the 1993 audited accounts) to EDM in 1995. The gap between&#13;
OERHN's fixed assets and the transferred debt is recorded in the equity as a contfibution of the&#13;
GOM.&#13;
16.   Net accounts receivable reflect the objective to reduce its level to the equivalent of three&#13;
months of billing beginning in 1998. Inventories are estimated at 1% of gross fixed assets in&#13;
operation and other receivables at 1.5% of gross fixed assets in operation.&#13;

Detailed Project Description, Costs, Justification&#13;
The project components are the following:&#13;
A. Rehabilitating the Selingue facilities&#13;
1. Repairing the dam&#13;
2. Repairing the power plant&#13;
3. Repairing the transmission lines&#13;
B. Maintaining the demand/supply balance&#13;
1. Reinforcement of the thermal capacity&#13;
2. Energy Efficiency Program&#13;
C. Strengthening EDM's management capacity&#13;
D. Long term institutional framework&#13;
Detailed Components&#13;
A. Rehabilitating the Selingue Facility&#13;
A. 1.     Selingue: repairing the dam:  The  works consist of: (a) reinforcement of the&#13;
embankment dam; (b) concrete facilities repairs; and (c) improvement of the monitoring devices and&#13;
instrumentation system. The works are expected to start in July 1996 and be completed by September&#13;
1997.&#13;
(a)    Reinforcement of the embankment dam: the proposed measures will allow for the&#13;
reinforcement of the stability of the dam and of the embankment. It consists of: (i)&#13;
improving of draining facilities; (ii) repairs to the upper part of the upstream embankment&#13;
crest; (iii) improving water-tightness of the contact zone between the right embankment&#13;
and the right bank; and (iv) repairs to the road superstructure.&#13;
(b)    Repairs of the concrete structure: the works are very similar to ordinary maintenance&#13;
works. They are comprised of the following: (i) the rehabilitation of the draining facilities;&#13;
(ii) a comprehensive check-up of the foundations by drilling in appropriate locations; and&#13;
(iii) the water-tightness of the contact zone between the embankments and the concrete&#13;
structure, as well as the repairs of concrete cracks.&#13;
(c)    Improvement of the monitoring system and instrumentation: this system will monitor&#13;
the structure of the dam and its precise deformations. This monitoring is based on&#13;
measuring hydraulic pressure of the concrete facilities, the earth embankrnents, and the&#13;
contact zones between them.&#13;
A.2.      Selingue: repairing the power plant:  The component consists of: (a) the rehabilitation&#13;
of the basic, general equipment of the powerhouse; and (b) a comprehensive overhaul of the four&#13;
power generating units. The works are expected to start in July 1996, one unit would be repaired each&#13;
year until 2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 10&#13;
(a)   General equipment of the power station: Including: (i) the rehabilitation of the&#13;
measurement system and hydraulic monitonrng system; (ii) the renovation of the filtration&#13;
system and the cooling system for the units, and (iii) the overhaul of the back-up existing&#13;
diesel generator.&#13;
(b)    Renovation of the four generator units: the priority will be given to unit 4 which is in the&#13;
most critical stage. For each unit, the following works will be implemented: (i) the&#13;
overhaul of mechanical facilities of the turbines, (ii) the renovation of speed and voltage&#13;
monitonng systems; and (iii) the overhaul and rehabilitation of the alternators: for this&#13;
item, the precise contents of the works will not be known until the units are disassembled.&#13;
A.3.      Selingue, repairing the transmission lines:&#13;
A.3.a. Selingue-Balingue Transmission Line: an expertise of these facilities was made in&#13;
1993. It confirmed that the 150 kV facilities are in good condition. However, some&#13;
equipment must be replaced.  It consists of: (a) The supply of security tools; the&#13;
replacement of insulators; the rehabilitation of pylon protection features; and (b) The&#13;
renovation of transformers and other equipment in the Selingue and Balingue substation.&#13;
A.3.b: Setting of the Transmission Network Electrical Protections: includes the supply&#13;
and installation of the necessary equipment to overhaul and rehabilitate the network&#13;
electrical protection of the interconnected network for the different voltage levels: 150 kV,&#13;
30 kV and 15 kV.&#13;
A.3.c: 15 kV Voltage Regulation in Balingue Substation: includes the supply and&#13;
installation of a transformer to maintain and regulate the 15 kV voltage level at the&#13;
Balingue substation and over the medium voltage distribution network. This would&#13;
prevent the need to use the Selingue alternators for voltage adjustment.&#13;
B. Maintaining the demand/supply balance&#13;
B. 1.     Reinforcement of the Thermal Power Capacity: Under this component, nine small&#13;
additional diesel units of I MW each would be installed with the objective of later transferning them to&#13;
isolated centers, when the Manantali dam is completed.&#13;
B.2.      Energy Efficiency Program: This component consists of studies and supply of goods to&#13;
improve load management and electricity end-use efficiency.&#13;
(a)    The load management studies will provide recommendations to: (i) reduce the household&#13;
and public building electricity consumption, (ii) limit the peak demand by appropriate&#13;
tariff incentives, and (iii) reduce technical losses in the distribution network.&#13;
(b)    Supply of goods to implement the measures resulting from the studies.&#13;

C. Strengthening EDM's Management Capacity&#13;
C. 1.     Training: Comprises training EDM's staff, either in Mali or abroad, in order to enable&#13;
them to properly run and maintain the facilities. Detailed objectives are to:&#13;
(a)    Increase the engineers' skill in operation and maintenance of hydro and thermal power&#13;
generation units.&#13;
(b)    Improve EDM's capacity to properly operate and maintain the transmission network.&#13;
(c)    Train some engineers in electricity dispatching techniques.&#13;
(d)    Increase EDM's staff capacity in distribution techniques.&#13;
(e)    Rehabilitate EDM's training center.&#13;
C.2.      Other support to EDM  management capacity: comprises: (i) various studies for&#13;
preparing future power sector development, and (ii) the supply of goods and equipment such as spare&#13;
parts, office equipment, etc.&#13;
Consultant Services (for components A and C). These include:&#13;
(a)    The supervision of the Selingue rehabilitation works and some technical assistance to EDM&#13;
for the management and supervision of project implementation.&#13;
(b)    The analysis of the behavior of the concrete structure of the dam to investigate the&#13;
possibility of any swelling that might occur. This phenomenon originates from a chemical&#13;
reaction between alkali elements in the cement and siliceous block elements of the concrete.&#13;
Although such a phenomenon has not been reported in Selingue, further analysis remains&#13;
necessary.&#13;
(c)    The study for a future dispatching center, taking into account the completion of the&#13;
Manantali power plant.&#13;
(d)    The hydrologic study carried out in 1975 as part of the feasibility study for the dam, is&#13;
being updated to integrate all available data since then. As a follow up, a new study will be&#13;
undertaken in order to review the flood spillway design and the rule curve for reservoir&#13;
operation.&#13;
D.    Long-term institutional framework study: The objective is to set up an institutional framework&#13;
conducive to the rapid and sustainable development of the power sector in Mali. Detailed objectives and&#13;
organization are given in Annex 7. The GOM will set up a steering committee of two to three members in&#13;
charge of: (a) organizing a wide consultation of all the stakeholders, before March 1997; (b) analyzing&#13;
questions, needs, and propositions raised during the first phase; and (c) proposing decisions to be taken by&#13;
the Government by mid-1998.&#13;

Economic Analysis, Detailed Assumptions&#13;
Justification for the overall Selingue Rehabilitation&#13;
1.    Detailed assumptions used for the proposed project and the two alternatives are the following:&#13;
Scenario 1:   Thermal alternative.&#13;
*  Diesel investment costs: US$1,100/kWh, life time: 15 years.&#13;
*  Fuel Costs for thermal generation: CFAF 48/kWh (i.e., US$0.092/kWh on average which is&#13;
the current EDM's thermal production cost with DDO fuel).&#13;
Scenario 2:   Thermal alternative + energy purchased from Manantall plant:&#13;
* The cost for the diesel units have been reduced by their remaining value when transferred to&#13;
isolated centers in year 2000.&#13;
*  Cost for the energy purchased from Manantali power plant: CFAF 25/kWh.&#13;
Scenario 3:   The proposed project:&#13;
* Overhaul of the units: US$4 million for each unit.&#13;
* Selingue Bamako line overhaul: US$2. 1 million.&#13;
* Thermal back-up during the overhaul: US$0.93 million for one unit overhaul (based on a 10&#13;
GWh and a 3 MW capacity loss during the overhaul).&#13;
* Operation and maintenance costs for the hydropower facilities during their remaining economic&#13;
life are taken in account (US$2 million per year: 0.5% of the civil-works facilities investment&#13;
cost and 1.0% of the electromechanical facilities cost).&#13;
v Probabilities of breakdown of the units before they are rehabilitated and related cost has been&#13;
taken in account (see next section: Electromechanical Repairs, Optimal Timing).&#13;
Discount Rate: 12%.&#13;
2.    The cost of these three scenarios are respectively US$48 rmillion (proposed project), US$115&#13;
million (thermal altenrative + purchase from Manantali), US$185 million (thermal altemative) and thus the&#13;
proposed project is by far the least cost option.&#13;
3.    The intemal rate of return for the overall Selingue rehabilitation was calculated by evaluating the&#13;
cost of the lost energy if the dam was drained off. The current average sale price (CFAF 70/kWH) has&#13;
been applied to the energy sold (energy produced minus technical and non-technical losses) and resulted in&#13;
an average energy loss estimate of US$22 million per year. Thus, the Intemal Economic Rate of Retum&#13;
(IERR) for the project is 66%, a result of comparing the project with the loss of energy over the remaining&#13;
economic life of the dam.&#13;
&#13;

Electromechanical Repairs, Optimal Timing&#13;
4.     Electromechanical facilities problems do not involve public safety and therefore appropriate timing&#13;
for the implementation of the repairs had to be assessed. In particular, the possibility of postponing these&#13;
works and taking a greater risk of a breakdowvn of the units was evaluated. The project and its proposed&#13;
timing ( scenario 1, 1996-1999) was compared to two other scenarios:&#13;
- Scenario 2:  Rehabilitation of the electromechanical facilities delayed after year 2000, after&#13;
the Manantali plant completion.&#13;
- Scenario 3:  One-year delay on the proposed project (1997-2000).&#13;
5.     In case of a unit breakdown, the costs involved are: (a) the cost of the replacement of the unit by&#13;
new equipment (US$7 million: US$3.2 million for the alternator, US$3.8 million for the turbine) instead of&#13;
the cost of its rehabilitation; and (b) the cost of the loss of energy during the time needed for its replacement&#13;
(US$2.8 million: estimated at 20 GWh pear year, lasting 1.5 year, cost equal to the thermal cost of supply&#13;
at US$0.092/kWh). In scenario 2, the rehabilitation of the four units would take place after year 2000 and&#13;
so the thermal backup planned in scenarios I and 3 would not be needed.&#13;
6.     The risks of breakdown of the units were assessed by the engineering firm in charge of the&#13;
technical expertise of the dam. Probabilities of breakdown were given for each year and for each unit.&#13;
Thus, the cost of each scenario was obtained by applying: (a) these probabilities to the cost of the energy&#13;
loss and the cost of the replacement of the equipment; and (b) the complementary probabilities&#13;
(probabilities of not having a breakdown and of being able to implement the repairs) to the cost of the&#13;
proposed repairs. To simplifv calculations, the various components of the units (turbine, alternator, etc.)&#13;
were considered as a whole and not as separate elements. Such a hypothesis can be regarded as legitimate&#13;
given the fact that both alternators and turbines are in critical condition and have high probabilities of&#13;
breakdown.&#13;
7.     Probabilities as estimated by the engineer grow rapidly and reach, in 1999 before Manantali plant&#13;
completion. 100% for the most damaged unit (unit 4). and close to 50% for the other units. The EDR of&#13;
the rehabilitation, compared to postponing the works after Manantali's completion, reaches 78% for the&#13;
whole rehabilitation and even higher for some of the units if considered separately (see following charts).&#13;
8.     Considering the uncertainties in assessing breakdown probabilities, another set of probabilities&#13;
were tested as a sensitivity analysis. These new probabilities of breakdown have been purposely downsized&#13;
to very conservative values such as 30% for units 1,2,3 and 50% for unit 4. The relative rate of return of&#13;
the rehabilitation compared to postponing until after Manantali. reaches 39%. One should be aware that the&#13;
assumptions for these calculations are very conservative. Indeed: (i) the simultaneous failure of several&#13;
units has not been taken into account although it is very probable (i.e., around 60% of probability in 1999&#13;
in scenario 2 with the conservative set of breakdown probabilities used for the sensitivity analysis); in this&#13;
case the loss of energy per unit would amount to 60 GWh/vear instead of the previous 20 GWh/year for the&#13;
loss of the first unit; and (ii) the cost for the loss of energy has been calculated on the basis of the actual&#13;
thermal marginal cost although deep outages would occur and would result in much higher costs than the&#13;
average selling price.&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
9.    Thus, the proposed project timing is a better solution than postponing the repairs until after the&#13;
Manantali dam completion. However, the timing of the project was also studied more precisely by&#13;
simulating a one-year delay of the project. The EDR of the project as proposed compared to a one-vear&#13;
delayed project reaches 41% with the first set of breakdown probabilities and, 21% with the set of&#13;
probabilities used for the sensitivity analysis. This shows that the timing proposed for this project is the&#13;
best one.&#13;
10.    The IERR for the electromechanical works was calculated by comparing the cost of the project,&#13;
including probable energy losses before completion, with the cost of the non-supplied energy in case the&#13;
works are never implemented, at the average selling price (14 cents/kWh). Technical and non-technical&#13;
losses have been taken in account, decreasing from 19% in 1996 to 14% in 2002. Under this hypothesis&#13;
the IERR is estimated at 98% if probabilities of breakdown given by the engineer are used and at 65% in&#13;
case of breakdown probabilities used for the sensitivity analysis.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
II.   Sensitivity of the ERR to the cost: Depending on the uncertainties on some repairs to be&#13;
undertaken, the cost of the Selingue rehabilitation works might increase from US$21.7 million to US$24.5&#13;
mnillion. With this new figure, the ERR of the Selingue rehabilitation would decrease from 66% to 56%.&#13;
12.    Sensitivity of the ERR to the works schedule: The rehabilitation work for each power generating&#13;
unit is planned to last nine months. If a full year was necessary, the related additional thermal generation&#13;
which would be needed will lessen the ERR of the Selingue rehabilitation works from 66% to 61%.&#13;
Justification for the Addition of 9 MW of Thermal Capacity&#13;
I1.   EDM plans to purchase 9 MW of thermal capacity of which 3 MW are necessary as back-up&#13;
during the rehabilitation of the Selingue generating units. This back-up capacity has been taken into&#13;
account as part of the cost of the project while calculating the ERR of the rehabilitation (see detailed&#13;
assumptions, para 1). If the remaining 6 MW were not purchased by EDM in 1997, important outages,&#13;
would immediately occur each year during the peak season until the completion of the Manantali power&#13;
plant. This would force EDM's customers to purchase small individual generation units which are far less&#13;
efficient.&#13;
12.    Calculation were based on the most conservative assumptions as observed in the region:&#13;

(proposed project)&#13;
Investment ($/kW)                                      1,080                       470&#13;
Life time (hours)                                     30,000                     4,000&#13;
Specific Consumption (gr/kWh)                           240                        700&#13;
These conservative assumptions yield an ERR of 65%.&#13;

Long-term Institutional Framework of the Electricity Sector Component&#13;
Objectives and Justification of the Component&#13;
I.    The objective is to set up a new institutional framework conducive to the rapid and sustainable&#13;
development of the power sector in Mali. The GOM will set up a steering committee of two to three&#13;
members in charge of: (a) organizing a wide consultation among all the stakeholders, before mid-1997; (b)&#13;
analyzing questions, needs, and propositions raised during this first phase; and (c) proposing, by the&#13;
beginning of 1998, decisions to be taken by the Govemnment.&#13;
Duration&#13;
2.     The total duration for this process is estimated at three years, starting with the nomination of the&#13;
manager of a small steering committee in charge of coordinating the process.&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
3.    The steering committee will have the responsibility to investigate, organize debates and/or launch&#13;
studies to formulate a comprehensive strategic proposal for the development of the sector mainly from the&#13;
institutional, financial, and human resource perspectives.&#13;
4.     This structure will be managed by a leader with extensive experience within the sector, and who&#13;
will have the capacity to work with the current or potential stakeholders: managerial staff of the involved&#13;
ministries (Energy, Finance, Territorial Administration, etc.), and also communities, consumers, the&#13;
banking sector, operators involved in the electricity industry, autoproducers, trade unions, etc. This list is&#13;
not exhaustive and other people/resources should be consulted for specific contribution.&#13;
5.    The Ministry of Mining, Energy and Hydraulics Will be in charge of the follow-up and the&#13;
implementation of the proposed conclusions.&#13;

Environmental Impact of the Rehabilitation Works and Mitigation Measures&#13;
Summary&#13;
I .    The Selingue reservoir encompasses an area of 409 km2 at the normal water level which is&#13;
348.5m. After ten years of operation, a detailed study by an engineering consulting firm&#13;
concluded that there was an urgent need for a systematic overhaul of the facilities after finding&#13;
several deficiencies due partly to poor monitoring and maintenance.&#13;
2.    The objective of the environmental study was to evaluate the impact of the proposed&#13;
rehabilitation program. These works consist of: (a) the reinforcement of the embankment damr,&#13;
(b) the concrete facilities repairs; (c) the improvement of the monitoring devices and&#13;
instrumentation system; (d) the rehabilitation of the basic general powerhouse equipment; and (e)&#13;
a comprehensive overhaul of the four power generating units.&#13;
3.    According to the nature of the planned works, the area which has to be taken into&#13;
consideration consists of the immediate vicinity surrounding the dam and neighboring areas where&#13;
some needed raw materials will be extracted.&#13;
4.    The results of the study include: (a) a description of the work to be undertaken, and (b) a&#13;
presentation of the area in terms of its physical, biological, human, and water resources.&#13;
Subsequently, the potential impact on the environment as a result of the rehabilitation of the&#13;
Selingue facilities was identified and comprised several aspects:&#13;
* the sand banks out of which the raw materials (stones, mud, sand) are extracted and the risks&#13;
associated with this excavation. These may include vibration, noise, and dust and also the risk&#13;
that water residue, created from the removal of these materials, may stagnate and become a&#13;
breeding ground from which malaria and yellow fever may develop,&#13;
* oil dumping, a risk derived from the dismantling of the alternators and turbines, may have a&#13;
negative impact on the surrounding aquatic areas;&#13;
*  the risk of erosion along the banks of the created drainage channel, extending lOm on either&#13;
side of the channel because of vegetation removal;&#13;
*  the risk of extreme traffic problems on the road which runs on the dam between the two banks&#13;
of the river, as a result of depositing the stones of the protection wall,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

the partial scraping of the hill and of the contact zone between the right embankment and the&#13;
right bank, entails carrying out and treating a large volume of earth which may encumber and&#13;
pollute the lake and the surrounding areas with harmful materials.&#13;
5.    The proposed measures to reduce the above-cited impact should also focus on works&#13;
planning in order to avoid injurious effects to villagers, the risks of dynamite (explosions should&#13;
be kept to a distance) and the accumulation of rainfall which could create favorable conditions for&#13;
insect larval development.&#13;
6.    To avoid oil spillage, it was suggested that the contractor should be required to provide&#13;
and use, as needed, absorbent material and protection film for the obstruction of the drain within&#13;
the powerhouse.&#13;
7.    To minimize the risk of soil erosion, it is necessary to quickly recreate the vegetation&#13;
carpet in the zone surrounding the drainage channel.&#13;
8.    To avoid the adverse effects on the transit capacity, the storage of the raw materials on the&#13;
dike road by the contractors should be minimized. The surplus of raw materials should be&#13;
returned to refill the extraction area.&#13;

Environmental Assessment of Selingue Facilities&#13;
Outline for a Mitigation Plan&#13;
Summary&#13;
l.    The environmental assessment of Selingue facilities, since their construction in 1981, was&#13;
carried out by an environmental consulting firm upon the request of the Energie du Mali (EDM).&#13;
2.    After 14 years of operation, the Selingue facilities have had several noticeable effects on&#13;
the physical and socio-economic environment of the surrounding area.   These effects have&#13;
materialized in several ways, which include:&#13;
* Local Climate: there has been an improvement of the annual rainfall, according to the local&#13;
population.&#13;
* Hydrology and Energy: the positive impacts on the hydrological regime of the Sankarani&#13;
river, which has been considerably modified, have been very important. These include: the&#13;
potential for generation of about 200 GWh per year; a large reservoir of 2,166 million m3&#13;
which can be used for agricultural development; the rise of the water level which is very&#13;
beneficial to agriculture and navigation on both the Sankarani and Niger rivers; and an&#13;
improvement in the level of the phreatic water in the surrounding area of the reservoir.&#13;
* Ecological Impacts: an important deforestation occurred, subsequent to: (a) the flooding of&#13;
the reservoir (409 krn2); (b) the substantial clearing of land to reinstall some of the displaced&#13;
population, and (c) the building of roads, paths, and the electricity transmission line to&#13;
Bamako.  This has not been sufficiently compensated by the slow natural regeneration&#13;
sustained by the reservoir.  The intensive commercial exploitation of forestry products has&#13;
magnified this problem.&#13;
Concerning aquatic flora and fauna, the general trend has been, meanwhile, to reinforce the&#13;
local biodiversity (appearance of new species: Polygonum, Echinochloa; the number of fish&#13;
species also rose from 42 in 1981 to 86 in 1995).&#13;
The terrestrial fauna migrated towards more quiet zones after their native habitat was&#13;
disturbed. The soil along the reservoirs has been more frequently flooded and remains almost&#13;
permanently saturated.&#13;
*  Sociological Aspects:  In this arena, there have been several marked changes: (a) the&#13;
organization and responsibilities of the farmers have been strengthened; (b) health&#13;
infrastructures have been built; (c) the migration of the youth has been reduced; and (d) the&#13;
traditional leadership system has been weakened particularly because of the rapid&#13;
monetarization and the development of juvenile delinquency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
* Economical Aspects: the impact of the Selingue hydroagricultural and electrical facilities on&#13;
the development of the Mali's economy has been considerable. At the local level, the impact&#13;
on the immediate area surrounding the facilities has varied from sector to sector. There has&#13;
been positive effects such as: (a) in the agricultural sector, a 1,200 ha irrigation perimeter has&#13;
been developed which led to the creation of several plantations, the promotion of agricultural&#13;
markets, and to the creation of temporary jobs, particularly for women; (b) in the fishing&#13;
sector, fish production rose from 600 kg before the dam was built to nearly 4,000 tons in&#13;
1994 and this has subsequently increased the number of activities linked to fishing such as ice&#13;
production, fish processing, and transportation of fish to Bamako. However, there has also&#13;
been negative effects including: (a) the reduction of agricultural land, the loss of fruit&#13;
plantations, the reduction of the harvest of Vittelanra paradoxa, Parkia biglobosa, and trees;&#13;
and (b) the flooding of several sites of gold exploration (Makandiana, Tanga, Dodala,&#13;
Kondjigula).&#13;
-  Health Aspects: Some negative impacts on the health of population continue to be important&#13;
although mitigation measures have been implemented. Several diseases remain widespread in&#13;
the area (e.g. schistosomiases rose from 0.9-3.2% in 1980 to 25-45% in 1995, malaria 32%&#13;
in 1980 to 75% in 1995). There have been, however, some positive impacts on the health&#13;
situation in the area as a result of the overall improvement of population's nutrition due to&#13;
agricultural development, greater access to potable water, and the creation of health&#13;
infrastructures.&#13;
3 .    To minimize the negative consequences that were identified, the study has proposed the&#13;
following additional mitigation measures:&#13;
* to improve the standard of living of the local population by increasing access to running water&#13;
and electrification;&#13;
* to improve the conditions for the development of agriculture through increased land&#13;
preparation and technical support;&#13;
* to improve water resource management by better taking into account the needs for&#13;
agriculture, the constraints of the fishing sector, and by regulating the various activities in the&#13;
reservoir area;&#13;
* to ensure a better monitoring of the reservoir; an alarm system, against soil erosion around the&#13;
lake, should be implemented;&#13;
* to ensure a sustainable management of the natural resources surrounding the reservoir:&#13;
reforestation and regulation for firewood utilization, information and education of the&#13;
population should be promoted; and finally&#13;
* to reinforce the local health plan, at the school and the community level, the resources of the&#13;
Centre de Sante de Selingue should be enhanced.&#13;

            Mali - Selingue Power Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Selingue Power
            Rehabilitation Project is to repair and rehabilitate the
            Selingue facility to ensure that the major source of
            electricity supply is not destroyed. Other objectives of the
            project are to: 1) maintain the electricity demand-supply
            balance by increasing the thermal capacity of the system and
            implementing an energy efficiency program; 2) improve the
            capacity of Energie du Mali (EDM) to properly operate,
            maintain and supervise its power generation facilities; and
            3) prepare a long-term institutional framework and
            regulatory system for the power sector and implement it as
            of 1999. The project consists of the following components:
            1) rehabilitation of Selingue hydropower facility including
            dam, power plant and transmission system; 2) maintenance of
            the demand/supply balance which comprises the reinforcement
            of the thermal capacity and an energy efficiency program; 3)
            strengthening of EDM's management capacity; and 4)
            long-term institutional framework.
