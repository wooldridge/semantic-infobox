Abstract&#13;
This survey looks at the relationship between economic performance and the&#13;
environment for technological change in centrally planned economies to draw&#13;
some lessons about what is needed for successful development. The lessons are&#13;
drawn from the experience of the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern&#13;
Europe, countries with the most experience! in trying to manage technological&#13;
change under a centrally planned system. The lessons are important for&#13;
developing countries that have either centrally planned economies or mixed&#13;
economies that combine aspects of central planning and market allocation. The&#13;
main lesson is that reforms limited to changes in the organization and&#13;
administration of research -- accompanied by minor improvements in such things&#13;
as diffusion targets, bonus systems in enterprises, and procedures for&#13;
technology imports -- are not enough to bring about big improvements in&#13;
technological performance. What these economies seem to need to accelerate&#13;
the pace of technological progress is a reform of the fundamental principles&#13;
governing the allocation and use of productive resources.&#13;

Summary&#13;
In all stages of technological change, from inventive activity to the phasing&#13;
out of obsolete products or processes, the centrally planned economies face&#13;
problems that are far greater than those of the industrial market economies.&#13;
These problems are best seen in the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern&#13;
Europe, countries with the most experience of central planning. These&#13;
countries have, as industrial latecomers, continued to lag behind the West in&#13;
their technology. And despite the investrnent of greater shares of their&#13;
national income on research, they have also failed to show any advantage in&#13;
productivity growth.  At the same time, the newly industrializing countries,&#13;
with their quasi market systems and greater openness to the world economy,&#13;
have been catching up with and sometimes surpassing Eastern Europe and the&#13;
Soviet Union in many critical industries and getting closer to the&#13;
technological level in the West.&#13;
The technological deficiencies of the centrally planned systems show&#13;
up in aggregate indicators of performance. During the period covering roughly&#13;
1950-65, the average growth of total factor productivity in the Soviet and&#13;
Eastern European economies was lower than that in developed market economies&#13;
but higher than that in developing countries. More recent comparisons of the&#13;
Soviet Union with western economies show t-hat the level of total factor&#13;
productivity in the Soviet Union is generally lower than that in the United&#13;
States and Western Europe.  They also show that the growth of total factor&#13;
productivity in the Soviet Union has been comparable to that of the United&#13;
States and United Kingdom, but generally Lower than that in the rest of&#13;
Western Europe and Japan, which have been catching up with the United&#13;
States. Moreover, the growth rate of total factor productivity in the Soviet&#13;
Union has steadily declined since the late 1950s.&#13;
To cope with these problems, the Soviet Union and the countries of&#13;
Eastern Europe have introduced many reforms to stimulate technological change,&#13;
mainly since the early 1960s. The first important line of charge was an&#13;
attempt to merge the originally separate research institutes either with&#13;
associations of enterprises producing similar products or with individual&#13;
large enterprises. Another important reform throughout the region has been&#13;
full-cycle planning of research work. For each major project, targets are set&#13;
- iLX &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- x -&#13;
to cover the development of technology and its full commercial application in&#13;
the economy, with users and expected effects specified. To improve control,&#13;
purely administrative arrangements have been replaced by contractual ones, and&#13;
along with the move to contracting, the research institutes have become&#13;
business accounting units. And to enable researchers to benefit from the&#13;
commercialization of research in industry, there have been several reforms to&#13;
provide bonuses to supplement wages at research institutes. But little has&#13;
been done to create procedures for licensing technologies by one organization&#13;
(a research institute or enterprise) to another.&#13;
Investment decision-making, always one of the main functions of&#13;
planners, remains highly centralized all over the region (except in&#13;
Hungary). Central planners decide not only on the allocation of investment&#13;
resources to branches of the economy but also on the construction of new&#13;
plants, the expansion of existing plants, and any sizable purchases of&#13;
machinery. Moreover, the choices of technology for projects -- choices that&#13;
determine capital intensity and the like -- are also in the domain of&#13;
planners. The bureaucratic apparatus for deciding about investments makes it&#13;
difficult for planners to respond flexibly to problems and possibilities.&#13;
From the early days of central planning, technological change in&#13;
enterprises has been promoted through the plan targets set by the central&#13;
authorities. Reforms affecting this lowest level of the organizational&#13;
hierarchy have generally been aimed at providing some kind of order in the&#13;
various technological targets passed on to the enterprises. They have also&#13;
been aimed at attaching a higher priority to these targets to counterbalance&#13;
other, often conflicting, objectives and at improving the system for&#13;
monitoring the fulfillment of the technological targets.&#13;
The focus on output maximization continues to dominate the plan&#13;
targets that central authorities set for enterprises, but over the years the&#13;
priority given to quality has significantly increased. State-sponsored&#13;
organizations for rating quality are of some help in upgrading quality. An&#13;
important element of central pressure on enterprises to improve quality is the&#13;
standardization system, which specifies technical requirements for the&#13;
manufacture and performance of particular products. Some countries have also&#13;
designed financial incentives to stimulate enterprises to upgrade the quality&#13;
of their products. And to relax the constraints of pricing rules, enterprises&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xi -&#13;
are being allowed to set the prices of new products higher than those of the&#13;
products being replaced.&#13;
A growing appreciation for the need to eliminate obsolete or inferior&#13;
products and processes has resulted in several adjustments. The prime&#13;
instruments for speeding up this elimination have been the production plans&#13;
for enterprises. But the central authorilties have found it difficult to. agree&#13;
on the products and processes to be deemed obsolete, and even unanimous&#13;
decisions by planners to scrap obsolete products have met much resistance in&#13;
enterprises. Moreover, the region has not been active in restructuring its&#13;
economy by curtailing production and investment in branches where the economic&#13;
advantage over other countries is doubtful.&#13;
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have also been strongly&#13;
interested in obtaining western technology, even during the years of the&#13;
highest political hostility. The acceleration of imports from western&#13;
countries since the mid-1960s has had many purposes. Generally, the goal of&#13;
the Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries has been to use western&#13;
technology to revitalize their technologically stagnating industries and if&#13;
possible to catch up with the West. Imported technology has also been&#13;
expected to provide products technologicaLly advanced enough to make the&#13;
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe more competitive in the world market. While&#13;
Hungary and Poland have seemed interested in getting more involved in world&#13;
trade, the Soviet Union and Bulgaria have been interested in export promotion&#13;
only to repay the technology bill to the West.&#13;
In sum, however, there have been no fundamental changes in the&#13;
management of technological change, the reforms of the 1960s and 1970s&#13;
notwithstanding. Technological development is still governed more by the&#13;
visible hand of the central authority than by the interplay of researchers and&#13;
the users of research results, while most research continues to be conducted&#13;
by institutes, not by enterprises.  Another continuous feature is the reliance&#13;
on domestic rather than foreign sources of technology, whether through copying&#13;
or invention.  Yet another is the priority given to investment in new plants,&#13;
particularly in the capital goods industries.  As a result, little of the&#13;
potential for upgrading existing plants is pursued.&#13;
What systemic factors might account for the relatively poor&#13;
technological performance in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union? Why has the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xii -&#13;
latest wave of reforms not greatly improved efficiency in the region? The&#13;
system now operated by countries other than Hungary can be called a&#13;
rationalized version of the traditional planning model.  The rationalizations&#13;
have included some ostensibly far-reaching changes in planning methods (such&#13;
as integrating physical and financial plans), in organization (such as linking&#13;
institutes and enterprises that deal with similar products), and in the&#13;
motivation of rnanagers and workers (such as relating wage funds to the&#13;
economic performance of enterprises and research units, with performance&#13;
measured by aggregate indicators, such as current profits). The systemic&#13;
modifications have left aside, however, the most important, core elements of&#13;
the central planning machinery, with only Hungary trying to change the core.&#13;
So, reforms in the way of financing activities, pricing products, or rewarding&#13;
managers and workers have generally not made much impact on the pace and&#13;
direction of technological change.  These reforms, at their best, have&#13;
involved fine-tuning. The limited impact of the changes makes the central&#13;
planners look for more changes.  But the main result has been an expansion of&#13;
new regulations, not a strengthening of the motivation for efficiency in&#13;
industry.&#13;
There are several plausible explanations for this poor technological&#13;
performance. The most important one is the wav allocaLive decisions are made&#13;
unrder central planning.  T'he system of decisicrn-making strongly affects the&#13;
motivation of state-owned enterprises and research establishments to engage in&#13;
technological change. The allocative mechanism puts these agents in a&#13;
situation where productive factors have zero prices, a situation that inspires&#13;
littie interest in cost-reducing innovations or in innovations aimed at&#13;
quality improvements.  The lack of interest in quality improvements is&#13;
reinforced by tl-e wea. influence of buyers. narticularly consumers, on&#13;
allocati;e decisions.  This explanation seems more plausible than the fact&#13;
th&amp;: ris.ks associated with technological change are not matched by&#13;
commensurate rewards.  CornpLementirng both these possible explanations is the&#13;
facE that the economies of the region, trading mainly with themselves, are&#13;
closed to many technological possibilities and pressures extant inr the rest of&#13;
the world.  The main conclusion is that a celtrilly planned economy can obtain&#13;
modest improvements in its technological development by tinkering with&#13;
policies and institutions -- but accelerating the pace of technological&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xiii -&#13;
progress appears to hinge on changing the fundamental principles governing the&#13;
allocation and use of productive resources.&#13;
Reforms limited to changes in the organization and administration of&#13;
research -- accompanied by minor improvements in such things as diffusion&#13;
targets, bonus systems in enterprises, and procedures for technology imports&#13;
-- have absorbed much of the energy spent on systemic changes over the last&#13;
decade. But these have not been sufficient to bring about big improvements in&#13;
technological performance. Broader reforrns to redesign the allocative system&#13;
-- perhaps following the first steps by Hungary, the most technologically&#13;
successful country in the region -- are needed to bring such improvements&#13;
about. But even the Hungarians will probably have to consider more funda-&#13;
mental reforms, if they are to bring their performance up to that in the West.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The Environment for Technological Change&#13;
in Centrally Planned Economies&#13;
How does central planning affect the environment for technological change?&#13;
The question is important because many of the world's developing countries are&#13;
centrally planned. Moreover, other developing countries have mixed economies&#13;
that combine aspects of central planning and market allocation. An&#13;
exploration of the relationship between economic performance and the&#13;
environment for technological change in centrally planned economies can&#13;
highlight issues important for successful development. I rely here on&#13;
observations gleaned from the literature on the Soviet Union and the countries&#13;
of Eastern Europe -- countries with the most experience of central planning&#13;
and the longest record of attempting to manage technological change under a&#13;
centrally planned system.&#13;
This paper begins by briefly describing the classic perception of&#13;
technology and technological change by central planners -- and how that&#13;
perception shaped the formation of technological policies and institutions.&#13;
After noting that the success with these policies and institutions was less&#13;
than that hoped for by the early 1960s, the paper details reforms since&#13;
introduced for research, for investment, for production, and for imports of&#13;
foreign technology. It next compares the region's technological performance&#13;
with that of the West and that of the newly industrializing countries --&#13;
mainly during the 1970s and early 1980s.&#13;
The author thanks Carl Dahlman, Richard R. Nelson, Bruce Ross-Larson, Gene&#13;
Tidrick, and Larry Westphal for ;ncisive and insightful comments that greatly&#13;
improved the arguments in this paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The paper then proffers some explanations for the region's lacklustre&#13;
technological performance. The fact that productive factors have zero prices&#13;
seems more plausibLe as an explanation than the fact that risks associated&#13;
with technological change are not matched by commensurate rewards.&#13;
Complementing both these explanations is the fact that the economies of the&#13;
region, trading mainly with themseLves, are closed to many technological&#13;
possibilities and pressures in the rest of the world. The main conclusion is&#13;
that a centrally planned economy can spur technological development by&#13;
tinkering with policies and institutions -- but only up to a point where&#13;
continuing progress appears to hinge on changes in the fundamental principles&#13;
governing the allocation and use of productive resources.&#13;
[. How Central Planning Affects Technology Policy&#13;
Under the traditional central planning of the 1920s and 1930s, technology was&#13;
seen as a public good -- and technological change was seen as a linear&#13;
process, with invention followed first by developmental work and then by&#13;
implementation. These classic principles led naturally to the centraLized&#13;
production and implementation of technological change. The central authority&#13;
decided what research wouLd be undertaken -- Largely through its alLocation of&#13;
funds for research. The central authority decided how state enterprises would&#13;
use major inventions -- largely through its allocation of the labor, capital,&#13;
and materials needed to innovate production. The central authority even&#13;
decided which production lines would be eliminated as technologically&#13;
obsolete, which plants would be refitted and reoriented, and which plants&#13;
would be closed down.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
Not much has changed, the reforms of the 1960s and 1970s&#13;
notwithstanding. Technological development is still governed more by the&#13;
visible hand of the central authority thani by the interplay of independent&#13;
researchers and major users of research results. Almost the entire research&#13;
potential operates in institutes, not in enterprises.  Early on, the&#13;
responsibility for inventive activities was spread over a few central&#13;
institutions, with academies of science playing the key role. Under the&#13;
reforms of the 1960s, the responsibilities shifted mostly to branch ministries&#13;
and to special ministerial bodies that oversee all research. Most of these&#13;
research establishments still concentrate their research on the problems of&#13;
single industries -- usually in efforts rr.ounted Lhrough a large scale&#13;
mobilization of resources.  All these facts make the research establishments&#13;
nearly exclusive as suppliers of technology (almost three-quarters of the&#13;
inventions certified and put into use in the Soviet Union came from research&#13;
institutes and similar establishments [Martens and Young 1976D).&#13;
Another continuous element of technological policy is the priority&#13;
for implementing inventions through investment in new plants, particiularly in&#13;
the capital goods industries. Beginning with the Soviet llnion in the earlv&#13;
1930s and Eastern Europe in the late 1940s, the region embarked on a policy of&#13;
massive diffusion of existing technoLogies throtugh large-scale investment in&#13;
new plants.  These countries have continued the pattern.  Cohn estimates that&#13;
only around 25 percent of industrial investment in the Soviet Union in the&#13;
1970s was directed toward modernization of existing plants, compared with&#13;
almost 50 percent in the United States (i976, p. 454). Authorities have,&#13;
however, begun to give more attention to investment En the technological&#13;
modernization of existing p'lan.s - to ren fng those piants, changing&#13;
manufacturing processes, and tne like.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4-&#13;
Yet another continuous element in technology policy is the general&#13;
reliance on domestic inventions.  In the first years of industrialization&#13;
after the second world war, the region supplied almost all its own technology,&#13;
often intensively copying western technology -- partly because of the&#13;
difficulty of getting western technology but also because of the desire to&#13;
develop an independent technological trajectory. This trend continues, even&#13;
though all the countries in the region have since the late 1960s become&#13;
interested in more extensive commercial transfers of western technology.&#13;
II. Policy Reforms at the Margin&#13;
The Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe have, as the later&#13;
section on technological performance will make cLear, had trouble closing&#13;
technological gaps between their industry and that in the West. Their limited&#13;
ability to upgrade their technology has made them pay a price in productivity&#13;
growth and economic expansion. These countries also have paid a price in&#13;
consumer welfare, since consumers do not enjoy the same variety and quality of&#13;
goods. To cope with these problems, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have&#13;
introduced reforms to stimulate technological change, mainly since the early&#13;
1960s.&#13;
Poland and Czechoslovakia originated the idea of the mixed model, but&#13;
then retreated to join most of the other countries in more cautious reforms.&#13;
Hungary, on the other hand, largely dismantled detailed planning as the&#13;
primary instrument of managing state-owned enterprises, and since 1968 has&#13;
operated a mixed economic system. Under this model, state enterprises are&#13;
given almost no direct goals for production and the like. They are guided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
indirectly through a complex system of rules on credit, price-setting, wage-&#13;
fund determination, and so on. Private and cooperative enterprises are&#13;
allowed to operate in many sectors of the Hungarian economy, such as services.&#13;
The system now operated by courntries other than Hungary can be called&#13;
a rationalized version of the traditional planning model. These rationali-&#13;
zations have included some far-reaching changes in planning methods (such as&#13;
integrating physical and financial plans), in organization (such as linking&#13;
institutes and enterprises that deal with similar products), and in the&#13;
motivation of managers and workers (such as relating wage funds to the&#13;
economic performance of enterprises and research units measured by aggregate&#13;
indicators, including current profits).&#13;
These systemic modifications have left aside, however, the most&#13;
important, core elements of the central planning machinery, with only Hungary&#13;
trying to change the core. So, reforms in the way of financing activities,&#13;
pricing products, or rewarding managers and workers have generally not made&#13;
much impact on the pace and appropriateness of technological change. These&#13;
reforms, at their best, are fine-tuning. This limited impact of the changes&#13;
makes the central planners look for more changes. But the main result has&#13;
been an expansion of new regulations, not a strengthening of the motivation&#13;
for efficiency in industry.&#13;
Research and Development&#13;
Industrial research was traditionally performed mostly by separate&#13;
organizations called institutes, expected to work exclusively for the&#13;
enterprises reporting to the same branch ministry, and directly subordinated&#13;
to the central ministries through plans. Only rarely were research&#13;
establishments built into larger enterprises and responsible to their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
management. This organization was expected to bring many benefits, including&#13;
the effects of larger scale, the elimination of duplicate work, the extension&#13;
of the time horizon, and the selection of projects according to the social&#13;
(not private) rate of return.&#13;
The scheme put in place before the second world war continued to meet&#13;
the requirements of planners during the first years after the second world&#13;
war, but it soon became apparent that research projects were not coordinated&#13;
with the needs of potential users. Lacking much of the needed information on&#13;
technological matters, the central authorities depended strongly on advice&#13;
from the research institutes, thus bringing in bias in favor of suppliers of&#13;
technology. Several important changes in the original scheme have since been&#13;
made to solve this problem.&#13;
Integrating research institutes. The first important line of change&#13;
has been the attempt at merging the originally separate research institutes&#13;
either with associations of enterprises producing similar products or with&#13;
individual large enterprises. This reform has been pursued most vigorously in&#13;
the Soviet Union, where it started in 1965 and accelerated after 1973, when&#13;
authorities decided to make the associations common to all branches of&#13;
industry. Similar changes have been made by Bulgaria and Romania, starting in&#13;
the early 1970s (Skoczny 1982).&#13;
These merged organizations, called scientific-Droduction associations&#13;
in the Soviet Union, are of two basic types. In one type the formal authority&#13;
lies in a single (usually the largest) participating enterprise. In the&#13;
second type, the leading institute is in charge of all the members, including&#13;
enterprises (Poznanski 1977). The first 600 scientific-production&#13;
associations were set up in 1970 (Bornstein and others 1980). Now there are&#13;
4,100, with total production estimated at 48 percent of industrial output in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
the country. About 95 percent of these associations fall in the first&#13;
category (Zarzow 1982, p. 62).&#13;
In many cases this integration oE research institutes and industrial&#13;
enterprises is merely an organizational rearrangement, under which research&#13;
institutes and enterprises are not fully controlled by these associations, but&#13;
continue to receive their orders from two other places: in the Soviet Union&#13;
from the State Committee for Science and Technology and from the respective&#13;
branch ministriess (Amann 1983). And the financing of research by institutes&#13;
and enterprises comes largely from different sources, often at different&#13;
levels of the organizational hierarchy.&#13;
Planning research. Another important reform throughout the region&#13;
has been full-cycle planning of research work. For each major project,&#13;
targets are set to cover the development of technology and its full commercial&#13;
application in the economy, with users and expected effects specified. To&#13;
enforce those targets, the central authorities name a leading research&#13;
institute to issue orders and oversee the work. Most of the countries also&#13;
classify projects to give preferential treatment to the most important.&#13;
In the Soviet Union the first step in this direction was in 1966,&#13;
when the coordination plans for research projects were instituted. In that&#13;
year 246 coordination plans were listed, covering about 3,000 projects of&#13;
special importance and representing 40 percent of the research budget. In&#13;
1976 these plans were replaced by scientific and technical programs, also&#13;
aimed at distinguishing sharply between projects of different priority and at&#13;
providing better grounds for the reinforcement of state control over priority&#13;
projects (Zaleski 1976).&#13;
These planning modifications force research institutes to analyze&#13;
where a given technology is going to be used; and with what effects, rather&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
than simply to look at the possibilities of pushing forward the technological&#13;
frontier. They also give potential users of new technology the opportunity to&#13;
take part in decisions on the parameters of new technology and the timing of&#13;
research. There nevertheless is some inflexibility in the decision-making due&#13;
to the many participants. Moreover, the system of planning, even though&#13;
allowing planners to consider competing alternatives, does not facilitate&#13;
further corrections. The alternatives are rather quickly narrowed down and&#13;
after completing this preliminary stage, there is much reluctance to pursue&#13;
more than one alternative. And there is an unwillingness, or inability, of&#13;
the central authority to terminate unpromising projects or reevaluate the&#13;
whole original strategy (Campbell 1976, pp. 97-112).&#13;
Contracting for research. To improve control, purely administrative&#13;
arrangements have been replaced by contractual ones, and along with the move&#13;
to contracting, the research institutes in most of the countries have become&#13;
business accounting units. This reform started in the Soviet Union in 1962&#13;
(NoLting 1976a, Berliner 1984), and soon almost all research institutes in&#13;
that country turned to a business accounting system based on contracts for&#13;
work. In the Soviet Union the reform introduced two forms of legal agreements&#13;
- contracts and work orders for research, the former drawn up by the branch&#13;
ministries. To back up plan-targets with legal obligations, all contracts and&#13;
work orders cover the specification of expected results, the terms and&#13;
schedule of finiancial compensation, the deadline for delivery of completed&#13;
work, and the penalties for delay or unsatisfactory results. As a rule&#13;
research institutes are offered preferential payments (higher profit markups)&#13;
for faster delivery or better-than-expected performance of resuLting&#13;
inventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
To work well this contractual system would require that the users of&#13;
the resulting technologies (enterprises and branch ministries) are demanding&#13;
and scrupulous in executing their agreements with research institutes. The&#13;
system of contracts (and work orders in the Soviet Union) does not force users&#13;
to be demanding, however. Ambiguity aboult the exact definition of a final.&#13;
product makes it easy for institutes to cLaim that their projects have been&#13;
completed even though they have not met the requirements set by their&#13;
cLients. It also makes it easy for enterprises and branch ministries to&#13;
accept formally the results of a project if they are not too concerned with&#13;
the product. Nor does this contractual system provide strong motivation for&#13;
timely and well-focused research. Except for some minor financial sacrifices&#13;
(lower or no markup), the research institute runs no risk of not being paid&#13;
for a failed project.&#13;
Pricing the results of research. One question about managing&#13;
research in any economic system is whether the results of research should be&#13;
priced and, if so, how. In the original planning system, no prices were&#13;
applied to the results of research. With the changes in research management&#13;
in the 1960s the central authorities decidled to promulgate regulations on the&#13;
pricing of research products, including technical services for industrial&#13;
enterprises. According to one line of arg;ument the reason for pricing is&#13;
simply to reflect better the value of research, providing users with better&#13;
information on the "economic scarcity" of their technology inputs and allowing&#13;
research institutes to finance their expansion from current revenues. The&#13;
other perspective on pricing is that prices should be directLy related to&#13;
economic benefits, allowing research institutes to share the advantage of&#13;
applied inventions with the user.&#13;
In the Soviet Union, for example, the research institutes have to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
cover their expenses (including wages) with the revenues from contracted work,&#13;
paid not simply in accord with the costs of a project but in some proportion&#13;
to the utilitarian value of the technology delivered and the timing of work&#13;
completion (Nolting 1976). The markup on top of actual costs of research is&#13;
also tied to the type of work and the quality of technology. Markups higher&#13;
than average are paid for faster completion of projects and better technical&#13;
parameters than negotiated in the original contract (Poznanski 1977a).&#13;
Customers are obliged by law to pay the costs of work as agreed.&#13;
But the way the pricing system works makes it difficult to verify&#13;
costs (Poznanski 1981). In Poland, for example, a uniform markup around 15&#13;
percent is agre!ed on, regardless of the results (Poznanski 1982). Moreover,&#13;
even though planners expect enterprises not to allow for cost overruns by&#13;
research organizations, the planned costs are commonly revised upward. But in&#13;
some countries, such as the Soviet Union, the research institute has to cover&#13;
additional expenses needed to improve the new technology, if its initial&#13;
parameters are below those stated in the contract, and if additional&#13;
corrections take more time than agreed with the customer.&#13;
The markups go into one fund that supplements basic wages. If&#13;
bonuses were paid to individuals directly involved in projects, the&#13;
attractiveness of reward would be greater. Only Poland has gone beyond the&#13;
bonuses paid through a joint fund. In 1973 a special fund was introduced to&#13;
allow the teams involved in research projects to participate directly in the&#13;
results of commercializing the research in industry. Research institutes were&#13;
authorized to collect a percentage of the cost reductions over the first three&#13;
years and to pay individuals directly involved in the research. It has been&#13;
recently revealed, however, that the effects of commercial applications have&#13;
been arbitrarily calculated, with some researchers given astronomic sums for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
trivial technological improvements, and with some enterprises transferring&#13;
money to the fund for technologies developed without any participation of the&#13;
recipient research institute (Poznanski 1981).&#13;
The bonuses provided by these schemes cannot compete with those that&#13;
continue to be offered by the supervisory bodies for compliance with the&#13;
traditional plan target for research. As Amann reports (1983, p. 31) the&#13;
research budget remains a key criterion in the Soviet machine-tool industry --&#13;
one of the few branches on the forefront of the reform movement -- and the&#13;
most important bonuses paid to institutes depend on the fulfillment of this&#13;
target. Why? The branch ministries, having control over institutes, find it&#13;
easier to execute these rather formalistic targets than to enforce the&#13;
efficient use of resources for research.&#13;
Licensing the results of researcl. Little has been done to create&#13;
procedures for licensing existing technologies by one organization (a research&#13;
institute or enterprise) to another. Potential users of a given technology&#13;
continue to have unhampered and costless access to domestic technologies in&#13;
most countries in the region, once these technologies have been developed and&#13;
paid for by the initial recipient. Among the few attempts to introduce&#13;
domestic licensing has been the series of regulations in the Soviet Union&#13;
allowing enterprises to sign contracts and charge other enterprises for the&#13;
transfers of technology. In the late 1960s enterprises were allowed to charge&#13;
others for the direct costs of a contract -- such as those of preparing&#13;
blueprints and giving technical advice -- but these charges were not intended&#13;
to help the enterprise recoup the costs of research. A series of decrees in&#13;
the early 1970s made it clear that only very limited charges are permitted.&#13;
Hungary has moved further than other countries in the region in&#13;
instituting a domestic licensing system. Its enterprises have been given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
legal protection through domestic patents and the ability to charge other&#13;
users (including foreigners) for subsequent commercial application of the&#13;
technology. ALso important, individuals not affiliated with a state agency&#13;
can sign a license with a domestic or foreign enterprise as well. The&#13;
domestic purchase of technology has to be covered by the users from their&#13;
profits, thus making them at least theoretically sensitive to the price&#13;
charged by the offering enterprise.&#13;
The reports from the Soviet Union and Hungary on the effectiveness of&#13;
licensing are mixed. Soviet economists say that licensing has not yet worked&#13;
due to the low sums an enterprise can charge the potential user. The Soviet&#13;
media are full of complaints by suppliers that entered contracts and found the&#13;
returns less than gratifying. But in Hungary the state buyers do not try to&#13;
shop around for technologies because they have found the costs of shopping to&#13;
be too high. And on many occasions, workers sabotaged technology taken from&#13;
other enterprises, in part because they did not want their bonuses reduced to&#13;
pay for that technology (Dezsenyi-Gueuellette 1984).&#13;
Investment&#13;
Decisions about investment. Investment decisions, always one of the&#13;
main functions of planners, remain highly centralized all over the region.&#13;
Central planners decide not only about the allocation of investment resources&#13;
to branches of the economy but also about the construction of new plants, the&#13;
expansion of existing plants, and any sizable purchases of machinery.&#13;
Moreover, the choices of technology for projects -- choices that determine the&#13;
appropriate capital intensity and the like -- are also in the domain of&#13;
planners. The enterprises generally have decision-making power only for minor&#13;
projects, though they influence decision-making through informal channels --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
say, by manipulating data used to evaluate investment projects.&#13;
Under the traditional system, state enterprises have no right to&#13;
acquire other enterprises, whether in the same branch or outside it, by&#13;
purchasing all or some of their assets.  Ihis means that innovative&#13;
enterprises cannot make capital acquistions that would promote the diffusion&#13;
of a given innovation. Nor are there any substitute mechanisms -- such as&#13;
centrally decided mergers -- that would enable enterprises to propagate&#13;
technological change through organizational fusion. Most of the central&#13;
decisions about mergers are motivated by considerations other than diffusion,&#13;
such as considerations of scale, simplified procedures, and so on.&#13;
The bureaucratic machinery for investment decisions makes it&#13;
difficult for planners to respond flexibly to problems and possibilities. To&#13;
ease this problem, some of the countries have tried to delegate some&#13;
investment decisions to managers, a reform that has succeeded only in Hungary,&#13;
and there, only half way. The way this works is by permitting enterprise&#13;
managers to seek investment resources from banks. But in fact, investment&#13;
credits are not distributed purely on the basis of how profitable is the&#13;
project submitted to the bank, since banks are given very specific&#13;
instructions by planners about who deserves what (reportedly, banks in Hungary&#13;
are given more than a dozen different criteria of project evaluation, one of&#13;
which is profit). It is estimated that onLy 10-15 percent of enterprise&#13;
projects are covered by their own means, while the balance is financed by&#13;
credits obtained from the banks (and occasionally by the budget). This gives&#13;
the planners strong leverage on the decision process for "decentralized"&#13;
investments. Thus, there is much sharing of investment decisions by&#13;
enterprises and the investment planners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
So far, there has not been much interest to get the private sector --&#13;
that still in existence -- more involved in investment decision-making. Only&#13;
the Hungarians have introduced a viable package of policies to expand the&#13;
nonstate sector in recent years. The intention has been to reverse the drop&#13;
of the private sector's share in total employment from 24 percent in 1960 to&#13;
only 4 percent in 1970 (Tardos 1983). The expansion of private enterprises&#13;
has been encouraged in services, including restaurants, and small stores. In&#13;
most cases state establishments have been simply leased or sold to private&#13;
individuals, and flexible arrangements have been made concerning pricing,&#13;
bookkeeping, and transactions. This does not mean, however, that the&#13;
Hungarian government has embarked on a large-scale reprivatization of the&#13;
economy, certainly not in the key manufacturing industries.&#13;
Instead, the Hungarian government has decided to promote&#13;
cooperatives, also by allowing mixed forms of production, where state&#13;
enterprises subcontract elements of their work to internal cooperatives. For&#13;
instance, the government recently decided to allow small cooperative groups to&#13;
operate within state-run farms and enterprises. Moreover, similar cooperative&#13;
groups with separate accounts can be estabLished within state-run industriaL&#13;
enterprises to manufacture products of their choice and price them on their&#13;
own. The financial rules applied to them are the same as for state-run&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
Financing investment projects. The logical complement of the heavily&#13;
centralized traditional version of the investment system has been budgetary&#13;
financing of the projects. Central planners had both the authority to&#13;
initiate projects and the financial means to carry projects out. Not much has&#13;
changed in the financial rules since the setting up of the original system,&#13;
considering that the investment decision-making rules have not changed either.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Budgetary financing has done little to promote technological change,&#13;
mainly because it does not provide strong incentives for the investors to&#13;
search for optimal projects or to economize on scarce investment resources.&#13;
Though not limitless, investment funds have a zero price to associations and&#13;
enterprises that a plant or production line is built for. Due to the obvious&#13;
scarcity of investment resources handled by the central authorities, the&#13;
lower-level organizations have had to cornpete for them with other units from&#13;
the same branch of industry. This competition is resolved not by the economic&#13;
benefits of projects, but by connections and bargaining power.&#13;
To make investors sensitive to the planned schedules and costs of&#13;
projects, central planners have been experimenting with various instruments,&#13;
including financial penalties for overruns. In Poland, for instance, the&#13;
banks are responsible for overseeing the progress of projects, and they&#13;
penalize investors for overruns by withdrawing specified amounts of money from&#13;
their calculated annual profits. Another instrument, also in Poland, has been&#13;
to tighten the cash flow to enterprises chat do not comply with the centrally&#13;
determined deadlines for depreciating budget-financed projects (Glikman and&#13;
Poznanski 1976).&#13;
Despite the continuous politicaL calls to improve technological&#13;
performance, almost none of the countries in the region has experimented with&#13;
an investment fund aimed exclusively at Einancing risky technological&#13;
changes. Funds for narrowly defined activities have been created to stimulate&#13;
export-oriented production as in Hungary and Poland but not to promote&#13;
technological change. An exception is tlhe recent Hungarian decision to set up&#13;
special central funds (with the heavy involvement of the finance ministry) to&#13;
promote technological change in severaL sectors of the economy, but only&#13;
state-owned enterprises can apply and the funds are much smaller than for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
export promotion.&#13;
Because standard-setting and similar measures have been of little&#13;
help, many countries in the region have looked to nonbudgetary forms for&#13;
financing investment, including the wider use of discretionary funds by enter-&#13;
prises. The assumption has been that enterprises would be more careful in&#13;
allocating their own funds. But most of these discretionary investment funds&#13;
have been short-lived or only a marginal source of investment resources. As a&#13;
rule, the funds accumulated at the enterprise level have been cut back&#13;
whenever an economy was going through difficulties. In PoLand, where every&#13;
shock has led to the short-run expansion of budgetary financing at the expense&#13;
of enterprise funds, the share of these funds in the total investment has&#13;
only occasionally exceeded 10 percent. The enterprise funds have also been&#13;
cut back because of attempts by the central authorities to restore their&#13;
previous power and to avoid what they see as confusion resulting from indepen-&#13;
dent decisions by enterprises.&#13;
The other line of changes has been to expand the role of bank&#13;
credits. But in almost all cases the selection of investment projects has&#13;
remained centralized -- their financing has simply been shifted from the state&#13;
budget to the state banks, carefully following the detailed decisions by&#13;
central authorities for the execution of projects. By and large, no positive&#13;
real interest rate was charged before 1980 or none with any relation to the&#13;
current scarcity of investment funds. Only after 1980, due to successive&#13;
upward corrections, did the interest rate acquire practical meaning (for&#13;
example, the real rate was 6-7 percent in 1981).&#13;
The only country in the region to reduce radically the role of&#13;
budgetary financing is Hungary, where only about 50 percent of total&#13;
investment is financed from the state budget, mostly in infrastructure. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
rest is financed from bank credits and resources accumulated by enterprises.&#13;
The enterprises are allowed to apply for credits, and the available funds are,&#13;
in theory, distributed competitively. The credits are supposed to be paid&#13;
back with interest from the profits earned by the borrower (that is, from the&#13;
excess of revenues over recurrent costs). Profits are also a source of funds&#13;
for investment, aLthough they represent the smallest segment of the investment&#13;
pool.&#13;
Recently there has also been some interest in instituting a capital&#13;
market in Hungary to stimulate more efficient use of investment resources by&#13;
the state enterprises. The government announced in 1982 that a limited bond&#13;
market would be opened. Bonds are available only to state-run enterprises and&#13;
cooperatives, but the intention is to allow private citizens to buy and sell&#13;
bonds as well. Bonds offer a higher yield than most bank accounts. This&#13;
reform is still in an early phase, but there is an indication that this move&#13;
is intended as a first step of an attempt to shift responsibility from the&#13;
state bureaucracy to a capital market.&#13;
The way that planners in Hungary operate financial instruments&#13;
reduces the innovative stimulus possible from financial instruments. Economic&#13;
regulations are frequently modified or replaced by a new piece of&#13;
legislation. During 1968-76 the government made more than 700 changes in the&#13;
financial rules, and the number of various "legal interpretations" and&#13;
"internal instructions" passed by branch miinistries was probably very high as&#13;
well (Szabo 1974, pp. 1-9). This instability of rules makes profit more&#13;
dependent on revisions and additions to law and less on a real effort by&#13;
enterprises, thus reducing the motivation for technological change.&#13;
Also reducing the motivation of enterprises is a heavy tax on&#13;
profits. The burden of taxation has been fluctuating in the past years due to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
changes in tax legislation, but always around a very high level.  In 1972&#13;
about 63 percent of annual profit increases were collected by the state, with&#13;
another 4 percent added to reserves. Only 33 percent of the incremental&#13;
profit was kept by enterprises to provide them with resources for investment&#13;
(27 percent) and wage increases (6 percent). This means that the growth of&#13;
profits has only a small impact on wages (see BaLazsy 1979).&#13;
What also "softens" the effect of financiaL rules on the behavior of&#13;
state-run enterprises -- in Hungary, but also in other countries -- is that&#13;
most financial instruments are highly individualized. For example, all taxes&#13;
other than levies linked to wages are differentiated by branches of the&#13;
economy, or even by segments of particular branches. The motive is to help&#13;
unsuccessful enterprise, particularly in financing their wage needs. But this&#13;
reduces the pressure on inefficient enterprises to come up with technological&#13;
improvements, especially if they can count on the planners' good wilL to&#13;
collect lower (or no) taxes over long periods. At the same time, efficient&#13;
enterprises are discouraged from undertaking some needed changes in production&#13;
because these offer only a small return.&#13;
Project execution. The choices made centrally are translated into&#13;
concrete projects mostly by the specialized organizations called investment&#13;
project bureaus. By and large subordinated to the branch ministries, their&#13;
function is to formulate the designs for new plants and production lines and&#13;
to specify the machinery that is to be installed and the sources of that&#13;
machinery. This gives the bureaus an important voice in influencing the way&#13;
new technology embodied in machinery is spread through the economy, though not&#13;
necessarily in line with what is desired by or optimum for enterprises for&#13;
which new capacity is built.&#13;
The separation of project activities from the production by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
enterprises has to have some impact on technological changes, since the&#13;
investment project bureaus lack much of the detailed information available in&#13;
enterprises, particularly that about incremental changes undertaken by an&#13;
enterprise without assistance from the bureau. Moreover, the enterprises lack&#13;
power in pushing the bureaus in a desired direction, since the bureaus are&#13;
financially independent of the enterprise management.&#13;
Since the beginning of central p;Lanning, most construction work has&#13;
been assigned to special organizations, with only some left to the industrial&#13;
enterprises. These construction organizations were originally subordinated to&#13;
various central bodies, particularly to the branch ministries, local&#13;
authorities, and special central bodies purely responsible for construction&#13;
work. The organizations have a statutory obligation to provide services for a&#13;
given branch of industry or a territorial area, and only exceptionally are&#13;
they assigned jobs outside their administrative unit.&#13;
This way of organizing construction has slowed diffusion by placing&#13;
the construction-service enterprises in a monopolistic position, and enabled&#13;
them to pursue their interests at the expense of customers. By and large, the&#13;
construction enterprises prefer routine projects (Schroeder 1979, pp. 323-&#13;
24). They also tend to prefer large projects, which make them look better and&#13;
require less total supervision (thus hurting the diffusion of smaller&#13;
projects). For the same reasons, they prefer projects with longer building&#13;
periods.&#13;
Production&#13;
Plan targets. From the early days of central planning, technological&#13;
change in enterprises has been promoted through the plan targets set by the&#13;
central authorities. The ongoing evolution of decision-making on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
technological changes at this Lowest level of the organizational hierarchy has&#13;
generally been aimed at providing some kind of order in the various (call&#13;
them) technological targets passed on to the enterprises. It has also been&#13;
aimed at attaching a higher priority to these targets to counterbalance other,&#13;
often conflicting, objectives and at improving the system for monitoring the&#13;
fulfillment of the technological targets.&#13;
A good illustration of the process of providing order is the&#13;
evolution of technological targets in East Germany. Until 1960 the state&#13;
enterprises were receiving three separate plans, one for adopting the finished&#13;
designs and processes, one for standardization, and one for undertaking&#13;
technical-organizational measures. In 1961 the list of plans was expanded to&#13;
include the introduction of research results, the implementation of important&#13;
inventions, and the goals for automation of manufacturing processes. The next&#13;
step was in 1962, when these plans were split in two sections, one for product&#13;
changes, the other for process technologies. This set of technological&#13;
targets remains a main vehicle for central intervention into technological&#13;
change at state enterprises (Bentley 1981).&#13;
This set of targets is supplemented in East Germany, and in other&#13;
countries of the region, by other plan targets intended to pressure&#13;
enterprises to make some other technological improvements and adopt other&#13;
rationalization measures as well. From the very first years of central&#13;
planning, the enterprises had been given targets for annual reductions in the&#13;
costs of production, changes in labor (or total factor) productivity, and&#13;
savings in the use of inputs, such as energy. These targets have had high&#13;
priorities in periods of economic stress.&#13;
Motivations for efficiency. The central authorities in all Eastern&#13;
European countries and the Soviet Union run a "nomenklature" system for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
appointing industrial managers and other top official3. Throughout the&#13;
region, there has been a continuous trend toward replacing political&#13;
appointees, who dominated the picture in the first years of central planning,&#13;
by professional staff, mostly with technical education. Other professionals&#13;
who have made it to the top in industrial management are those with education&#13;
in economics, accounting, and organizational theory. This preference for&#13;
technocratic staff has made the state-owned enterprises operate more according&#13;
to technological considerations.&#13;
There have also been some attemp:s at basing personnel decisions on&#13;
an explicit evaluation of technological performance, such as the policy&#13;
announced by Andropov of firing managers unable to keep the quality of&#13;
production sufficiently high. This explicit policy has some limits, however,&#13;
because the managerial group is part of the political structure which the&#13;
central authorities have to canvass for support. So, harsh personnel&#13;
decisions can backfire if the managers find the sanctions unacceptable and&#13;
react by refusing to support the central authority.&#13;
The complement to direct personnel decisions is a system of monetary&#13;
rewards for good technological performance. Until the mid-1950s there was no&#13;
explicit system of centrally supervised financial rewards aimed specifically&#13;
at technological innovation in enterprises. Since then, explicit systems have&#13;
been developed in all countries of the region. These systems link general&#13;
bonuses, particularly those for managers, to the fulfillment of technological&#13;
targets. They also use separate funds for rewarding the personnel of&#13;
enterprises for successful individual technological projects sponsored by the&#13;
central authorites or undertaken by the enterprises. But the payments to&#13;
individuals are generally small, not more than 2 percent of total salaries and&#13;
around 5 percent of salaries paid to nonline workers, such as supervisory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
personnel and design engineers (BerLiner 1976 and Freris 1979). So the&#13;
payments do not have much effect.&#13;
Pricing goods. The technology policy implemented in the first years&#13;
of Soviet planning directed technological changes without the intervention of&#13;
prices, which were seen as useless except for their computational function.&#13;
This fundamental principle has not changed much since. Enterprises are&#13;
expected to provide data on costs, but the decision on most prices is left to&#13;
the authorities. Prices are by and large calculated as a sum of costs plus a&#13;
profit markup. For a given type of product, they are set on the basis of the&#13;
marginal supplier's cost.&#13;
In some countries, price-setting has been partly passed down to&#13;
associations and enterprises to simplify the procedures for approving price&#13;
revisions. But with few exceptions (farm markets in Bulgaria, Poland, and the&#13;
Soviet Union), prices of new goods continue to be set centrally in all&#13;
countries in the region, except Hungary. In Hungary enterprises determine&#13;
most prices the!mselves, but on the basis of a centrally decided framework that&#13;
obliges them to move toward world prices. Enterprises are excluded from&#13;
pricing decisions for only a few goods of special importance (to allow the&#13;
authorities to protect lower income groups or keep inflation low).&#13;
The centralization of all decisions on product prices limits the&#13;
flexibility of prices in following numerous changes in supply and demand. To&#13;
soften these limitations, the price commissions in most countries are&#13;
supported by many research institutes, design bureaus, and the like. They are&#13;
obliged to gather necessary information on the cost of production and to&#13;
perform time-consuming calculations. Most of these organizations represent&#13;
the interests of their branch of industry, making the problem of reliability&#13;
great.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
For the most part, the effort in price reforms has gone not into the&#13;
locus of decision-making but into the methods of calculating prices. Some&#13;
changes have been aimed directly at having prices promote technological&#13;
change. The most important reform has been that in the late 1960s by the&#13;
Soviet Union, to give the state-owned enterprises the right to apply of above-&#13;
average markups (above the average for the whole group of producers of a&#13;
similar product) for new goods (Berliner 1976). These prices can be charged&#13;
by the innovating enterprise only for a certain period, usually three to four&#13;
years, after which the price (in practice,, the markup) has to come down to the&#13;
average for the given group of products. All decisions within this system are&#13;
set by the central authorities, and they are responsible for the yearly&#13;
reductions to the lowest final level.&#13;
There is not much evidence that the attempt to use price rules to&#13;
stimulate technological change has proved successful. A common practice among&#13;
state enterprises in Poland and the Soviet Union has been to apply for&#13;
temporarily higher prices for goods often representing a very minor or&#13;
insignificant improvement over the original ones. And due to the slowness of&#13;
decisions by the state pricing bodies, the gradual diminishing of preferential&#13;
prices to the branch average is not fully executed. In the Soviet Union, for&#13;
instance, many preferential prices are left at their higher value&#13;
indefinitely. Although of little help in promoting technological changes, the&#13;
preferential prices are seen by many as a vehicle for inflation.&#13;
Upgrading quality. The early policy priorities did not inspire&#13;
enterprises to upgrade the quality of their products. Even long-lasting&#13;
deteriorations of once high-quality products were frequent. Maintaining and&#13;
improving quality obviously requires some additional work by manufacturing&#13;
personnel and remaking or scrapping some poorly made products. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
conflicted, however, with the primary function of enterprises determined by&#13;
the central authorities: to maximize output from the scarce inputs.&#13;
The focus on output maximization continues to dominate the plan&#13;
targets that central authorities set for enterprises, but over the years the&#13;
priority given to quality has significantly increased. Several devices, such&#13;
as the pricing changes noted earlier, have been built into enterprise plans to&#13;
promote high quality. In addition, in the 1960s most of the countries&#13;
introduced obligatory rating systems for all products to specify quality, and&#13;
central authorities used these systems to set targets for enterprises and&#13;
decide on the removal of products from production. For instance, part of&#13;
Soviet industry has since 1968 operated a system of rating all products in&#13;
three categories every three years (Hill 1984). Relying on these ratings the&#13;
central authorities give yearly targets for the proportion of new output&#13;
classified in the highest category of quality, and those in the lowest&#13;
category are targeted for termination (see the next subsection).&#13;
The more accurate the assessment of quality, the more effective the&#13;
promotion of product improvement can be. The most objective assessment would&#13;
be one by an institution independent of the supplying enterprise, but&#13;
involving a representative of the latter. The presence of the customers is&#13;
needed too. In some countries, institutions of that type exist, such as the&#13;
Soviet state rating commission (Gustafson 1981, p.33) comprising the principal&#13;
customer, the branch ministry, and representatives from other central&#13;
administration agencies. These institutions face many problems, however,&#13;
among them the heavy influence by the interested branch ministry, which also&#13;
has the best knowledge and equipment needed for tests of quality.&#13;
The state-sponsored organizations for rating quality are of some help&#13;
in upgrading quality, but they cannot protect consumers from shoddy goods. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
all countries of the region the voice of consumers is heard through the&#13;
official media, which frequently publish critical opinions on low-quality&#13;
goods and their manufacturers. Generally, however, there are no journals&#13;
exclusively devoted to the expression of consumer opinions and the&#13;
institutionalization of the consumer movement is embryonic. One exception is&#13;
Poland, where a formally independent consumer protection organization was set&#13;
up in 1982, with a widely available weekly magazine completely devoted to&#13;
quality and price issues.  Hungary also has some forms of consumer protection.&#13;
An important element of central pressure on enterprises to improve&#13;
quality is the standardization system, which specifies technical requirements&#13;
for the construction and performance of particular products. In the Soviet&#13;
Union, the State Committee for Standards sets technical standards for most&#13;
manufactured products. Since 1968 the realization of tho3e standards has&#13;
become one of the targets for enterprises in the annual plans. By raising&#13;
state standards, the central administration can pressure enterprises to&#13;
upgrade their products. As Hill (1984) reports, the standards in many&#13;
branches of the machine industry tend to follow those represented by western&#13;
models of machinery. But the enterprises have considerable opportunity to&#13;
make the Committee soften its requirements, and the practical execution of the&#13;
standards in force is not easy to obtain (see Martens 1984).&#13;
Some countries have also designed several financial incentives to&#13;
stimulate interest among enterprises in upgrading the quality of their&#13;
products. Generally, the product quality targets (they are not standards) are&#13;
associated with preset bonuses and sanctions. But few specific funds are&#13;
designed for paying bonuses. Instead, the fulfillment of product quality&#13;
targets is one element in the performance revaluation of an enterprise&#13;
determining the bonus payments to managers. The only important attempt to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
create a direct link between quality and incentives has been the experiment&#13;
with above-average profit margins for new products of the highest quality.&#13;
Terminating obsolete production. Another aspect of quality promotion&#13;
is the elimination of inferior products. In the first decades of rapid&#13;
postwar industrialization, removing obsolete lines of production was by no&#13;
means critical. With the vast investment programs and increases in&#13;
employment, the demand for products -- of any quality -- largely exceeded&#13;
supplies. This in turn made the leadership link economic advancement with&#13;
output. From that perspective, eliminating technologically obsolete but&#13;
physically operational lines of production was seen as undermining the main&#13;
goal of maximizing output. But by the early 1960s, the need to eliminate&#13;
older lines became more obvious, partly due to the involuntary stockpiling of&#13;
such consumer goods as wool and cotton stockings and old fashioned vacuum-tube&#13;
radios. The additional pressures on old production lines came in the 1970s in&#13;
response to input constraints, such as those on energy and materials.&#13;
The growing appreciation for the need to eliminate obsolete products&#13;
and processes has resulted in several adjustments. The production plans for&#13;
enterprises have been the prime instrument for speeding up this elimination.&#13;
As noted earlier, the production plans in most countries in the region carry&#13;
explicit commands for products to be terminated in a given period. Those&#13;
targets are set on the basis of detailed information that enterprises provide&#13;
to their branch ministries. Products of a certain age are classified in a&#13;
separate category, and among them the selection for termination is made by&#13;
interested ministries, usually with a certain desirable average age for a&#13;
given group of products in mind (Berliner 1976).&#13;
The decisions by planners to scrap obsolete products are usually&#13;
surrounded with controversy, and there often are strong forces operating on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
the enterprise against the termination. Wiorkers, for instance, tend in many&#13;
instances to push for the continued use olf certain machinery and production of&#13;
traditional products, since they are familiar with them. And managers may&#13;
feel uneasy about eliminating production lines that still provide some&#13;
benefits (such as to serve as a buffer in periods of pressure).&#13;
Nor do central authorities, for the same reasons, easily reach&#13;
unanimous conclusions about obsolescence. The authorities in Eastern Europe&#13;
and the Soviet Union tend to prefer partial changes in existing plants and, if&#13;
need be, complete restructuring rather than closure. In general, the branch&#13;
ministry or the lower level units down to the enterprise are responsible for&#13;
absorbing employees who lose their assigned work due to the replacement of old&#13;
production lines by newer ones. This policy greatly reduces the concerns&#13;
workers have about replacing old machinery or shifting to new products. But&#13;
it is not costless, since partial changes and restructuring of existing plants&#13;
can be more expensive than other choices, such as building a completely new&#13;
plant.&#13;
So far the region has not been active in restructuring its economy by&#13;
eliminating branches where the technological advantage over other countries is&#13;
doubtful. To introduce such a policy would require many new instruments that&#13;
are not widely developed, if they exist at all (retraining programs,&#13;
compensation schemes, cross-industry placeiment offices) Hungary is&#13;
introducing some of these instruments to make its recently announced&#13;
structural policy work properly (Poznanski 1983). And Poland has introduced&#13;
compensation schemes and some other instruments to reallocate labor and other&#13;
resources to priority industries as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Imports of Technology&#13;
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have been strongly interested in&#13;
obtaining western technology, even during the years of the highest political&#13;
hostility. The large-scale expansion of imports has been recent, however.&#13;
The acceleration of imports from western countries since the mid-1960s has had&#13;
many purposes. Generally, the goal of the Soviet Union and the Eastern&#13;
European countries has been to use western technology to revitalize their&#13;
technologically stagnating industries and if possible to catch up with the&#13;
West. Imported technology has also been expected to provide products&#13;
technologically advanced enough to make the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe&#13;
more competitive in the world market. While Hungary and Poland have seemed&#13;
interested in getting more involved in world trade, the Soviet Union and&#13;
Bulgaria have been interested in export promotion only to repay the technology&#13;
bill to the West.&#13;
This recent drive to import western technology has been accompanied&#13;
by several important policy modifications During the first decades of the&#13;
cold war, the only two important ways of acquiring western technology in the&#13;
region were through noncommercial channels (industrial espionage and illegal&#13;
copying of patent-protected goods) and through imports of technology embodied&#13;
in industrial machinery and equipment. The latter imports have traditionally&#13;
taken the lion's share of hard-currency expenditure in those countries&#13;
(Poznanski 1984a).&#13;
The countries of the region have since the mid-1960s expanded the&#13;
role of commercial channels. Several new approaches have been tried, one of&#13;
them by the Soviet Union, which more than any other country in the region&#13;
focused its policy on importing technology through turnkey plants. Almost all&#13;
the biggest projects based on the latest western technology have been of this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
type. In chemicals, dozens of complete installations have been set up by&#13;
western contractors. In the automotive industry, the two major projects have&#13;
been also turnkey arrangements (at Togliatti for passenger cars and at Kamaz&#13;
for trucks). Many turnkey plants have been imported for other manufacturing&#13;
branches as well, such as a complete factory for small, high-quality bearings&#13;
and a numerically controlled lathe plant. Such projects have become very&#13;
important in Eastern Europe as well (Zaleski and Weinert 1980).&#13;
The imports of turnkey plants have lowered the organizational and&#13;
technical effort by the Soviet Union to get new lines of production on stream,&#13;
as well as the risk. But they are also costly, too costly for the countries&#13;
of Eastern Europe, which are severely constrained by the low availability of&#13;
western currency because they lack things easily sold on western markets, such&#13;
as gas, oil, and gold.  So, the turnkey projects in Eastern Europe have been&#13;
mostly limited to the chemical industry. Now, even Soviet planners seem to&#13;
view this policy as too expensive, for they are clearly trying to shift from&#13;
building turnkey plants to the retooling of old plants. For example, the&#13;
makers of the domestically designed passenger car (Moskvitch) are paying car&#13;
makers in Italy and France to help in the developmental work for a fuel-&#13;
efficient front-wheel-drive car and in the acquisition of western equipment.&#13;
Nor have imports of turnkey plants ensured against delays or cost&#13;
overruns. In the Soviet Union, many such projects were delayed substantially&#13;
(at least three years for the Togliatti passenger car plant and the truck&#13;
plant on the Kama River). Even with the hielp of western companies, the time&#13;
needed for construction is generally much longer than in the West. In the&#13;
chemical industry, for instance, the construction period for turnkey plants&#13;
was three to four years longer than in western countries (Hanson and Hill&#13;
1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
As a way of paying for turnkey plants, firms in the Soviet Unio and&#13;
Eastern Europe have tried to exploit buy-back agreements (also called&#13;
countertrade) with firms in the West. In many cases, western companies have&#13;
exchanged complete industrial plants or entire production lines for long-term&#13;
supplies of goods, particularly raw materials, often at fixed prices agreed in&#13;
advance. In the Soviet Union alone, contracts of that type were signed for&#13;
almost $20 billion during 1973-77. Almost 90 percent of Soviet deliveries of&#13;
natural gas to OECD countries were done through this type of contract in 1968-&#13;
74. Some Eastern European countries have also entered contracts or other&#13;
agreements requiring some reciprocal supplies of goods to the West.&#13;
What, then, about licensing? Soviet purchases of licenses in 1965-77&#13;
were several times higher than in the years before, but less than a tenth of&#13;
those by Japan in the 1970s (Hanson 1983). Czechoslovakia and Poland, the&#13;
main importers of licenses in the last decade, paid royalties on their&#13;
licenses of $119 million in 1981, much above the level reported ten years&#13;
before (less than $20 million in 1971). The payments in 1981 were&#13;
nevertheless low by the standards of many borrowers of western technology&#13;
outside the region. For example, Brazil and Mexico, with comparable combined&#13;
industrial capacity, paid an estimated $1,200 million for license agreements&#13;
in that year (Poznanski 1984).&#13;
Poland has coupled Licensing agreements with purchases of western&#13;
machinery. Its technology has been acquired through license agreements for&#13;
such industries as machine building, transport equipment, and telecommunica-&#13;
tions equipment (especially radios, cassette recorders, and television&#13;
sets). Poland has been among the most innovative importers of technology&#13;
through licenses, such as with its negotiations on small farm vehicles with&#13;
General Motors of the United States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
Hungary puts much more effort than the others toward building up&#13;
industrial cooperation agreements with western suppliers of technology: that&#13;
is, agreements providing for long-run mutual supplies of components and in&#13;
some cases for joint production for specific markets. These agreements open&#13;
doors for the informal flow of technology in ways almost impossible under&#13;
turnkey projects and license agreements: say, for the inflow of the&#13;
production experience of western partners and for the joint development of new&#13;
projects with reciprocal flows of technology. Of more than 800 cooperation&#13;
agreements between western companies and the region in 1975, 228 (almost 30&#13;
percent) were with Hungary. Poland was second with 216 agreements, the Soviet&#13;
Union third with 196 in 1975 (Poznanski 1984d).&#13;
While different, the policies of the Soviet Union and the Eastern&#13;
European countries have shared an important common element: none has tried to&#13;
rely on foreign direct investment as a primary source of technology. This&#13;
fact distinguishes Eastern European and Soviet policy toward technology&#13;
imports from the approach taken by many of the rapidly growing countries of&#13;
Latin America and the Far East. Total direct equity investment by western&#13;
countries in Eastern Europe is estimated at about $100 million in 1983,&#13;
whereas the cumulative value of the western investments in 1980 was $7.5&#13;
billion in Brazil arid $5.9 billion in Mexico (Poznanski 1984a). Many other&#13;
developing countries have relied heavily on overseas investors: an example is&#13;
the Philippines, where the foreign direct investment stock approached $1.8&#13;
billion in 1980. But foreign direct investment has played only a minor role&#13;
in the development of South Korea, one of the most rapidly growing developing&#13;
countries (Westphal, Rhee, and Pursell 1981; Dahlman and Sercovich 1984).&#13;

III. How the East Measures Up to the West and South&#13;
The question of how the centrally planned economies measure up to the market&#13;
economies has been a subject of debate since 1930s, with the theoretical&#13;
discussions of the allocative efficiency of centrally planned economies by&#13;
Mises, Hayek, and Lange. In a recent analysis Nelson (1979) concludes that&#13;
most theoretical arguments show centrally planned economies to be less&#13;
efficient in pursuing technological changes, but that there is no ground for&#13;
claiming that some elements of nonmarket control are not necessary -- or for&#13;
claiming that private agents can take care of all innovative activities in a&#13;
way that satisfies the aggregate welfare maximization objective.&#13;
Empirical evidence supports Nelson's claim. (See the tables at the&#13;
end of this paper for comparative data on research and productivity.) One&#13;
critical problem the East faces is the low efficiency of its research&#13;
potential. It is difficult to measure this type of efficiency because there&#13;
are no good ways of calculating research output (see Freeman 1975). Analysis&#13;
of foreign patents shows, maybe in an exaggerated way, the inefficiency of&#13;
research in the region. For instance, Poland employed 83,000 researchers in&#13;
1979, France 67,000. The work of researchers resulted in 855 patent&#13;
applications abroad by Poland and 19,276 by France -- a more than twentyfold&#13;
difference. In fact, the number of patent applications for France was almost&#13;
twice as high as that for Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union combined&#13;
(Maciejewicz and Monkiewicz 1982, p. 23).&#13;
Another indicator of the research sector's low efficiency is the&#13;
small number of technologies licensed by the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe&#13;
abroad. In Poland, for instance, only five or six technologies were licensed&#13;
in the postwar period, with annual royalties from all license agreements of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
only $1-2 million (Maciejewicz and Monkiewicz 1983). The combined annual&#13;
receipts for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were $40-50 million,&#13;
comparable to royalties recently paid to such countries as Norway or Sweden.&#13;
The system also appears to induce a bias for process innovations&#13;
rather than product innovations. The stucly of innovations in Polish industry&#13;
by Poznanski (1980, p. 254) showed that more than half were process&#13;
innovations (48 of 86 innovations whose nature was identified). Another study&#13;
of 164 innovations in several Polish industries in 1977 showed that new&#13;
processes dominate technological change in the economy (Poznanski and others&#13;
1977). This picture differs from that for market-type enterprises, which&#13;
generally are preoccupied with new products.&#13;
Another system-related problem is slow diffusion. For instance,&#13;
Soviet industry was in the forefront of developing oxygen steel-making and&#13;
continuous casting. It introduced these technologies on a limited scale in&#13;
1958, only a few years after the western pioneer, Austria. But the share of&#13;
these technologies in total steel production in the Soviet Union is now a&#13;
third that in most western countries. According to Poznanski (1983) the share&#13;
of the oxygen-steel process in total steel production was 17 percent in the&#13;
Soviet Union in 1970 compared with almost 56 percent in West Germany, even&#13;
though the two countries built their pilot plants at almost the same time.&#13;
The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have been slow in the diffusion of&#13;
technology despite higher investment rates than most of the western countries&#13;
and despite their emphasis on capital goods as the means to diffuse&#13;
innovations. So, the slower diffusion can be ascribed not to physical&#13;
constraints but to systemic problems.&#13;
Industries in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are slow to shift&#13;
away from obsolete technology. For instance, the steel industry in these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
countries continued to expand production from traditional installations&#13;
(Bessemer and open-hearth) long after 1967, when new equipment based on basic&#13;
oxygen technology began to be installed. In western countries, by comparison,&#13;
output from traditional installations has declined since shortly after the&#13;
basic oxygen process became established in 1961 (Slama 1981). In the car&#13;
industry, both the Soviet Union and Poland built large plants for&#13;
manufacturing new western licensed models in the last decade, yet they&#13;
continue to make cars using the technology of the 1950s (like the more than&#13;
thirty-year old, domestically designed "Syrena" still made in Poland in 1984).&#13;
These countries appear to be equally slow in the diffusion of&#13;
domestic and foreign technology. As Hanson (1981, pp. 37-38) pointed out in&#13;
his recent account of Soviet imports of western technology, there has been&#13;
almost no diffusion of technology acquired by several newly constructed&#13;
chemical plants to other, older plants in that industry. A study by a Polish&#13;
research team (Nowicki and others 1978) shows that in one branch of the Polish&#13;
chemical industry only 14 percent of western licensed technologies purchased&#13;
for this sector in 1966-75 have been adopted outside the original production&#13;
lines. The corresponding shares were 30 percent for machinery, and 24 percent&#13;
for metallurgy.&#13;
Slow diffusion of new technology is reflected, among other things, in&#13;
a high age for machinery and other equipment. The average service life of&#13;
chemical installations was 28 years in the Soviet Union during 1961-66,&#13;
compared with 11 years for the United States in 1974. In the machinery&#13;
industry, the respective averages were 26 years and 8-12 years; in electric&#13;
power 39 years and 18-20 years; and in textiles and apparel 28 years and 9-14&#13;
years (Cohn 1979). The average service life in Soviet Union has been reduced&#13;
since then, but it continues to be much higher than in the United States, even&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
though the United States channels far fewer resources into gross investment.&#13;
Because of the slowness in diffuSing new technology and in&#13;
terminating obsolete products and equipment, the quality of many goods&#13;
manufactured in the region is disappointing, even among products of once-high&#13;
standards. Czech consumer goods, once highly valued by the Eastern European&#13;
and Soviet customers, are seen now as being mostly obsolete and of low&#13;
quality, even by Czechs. In 1982 about 40 percent of the textile products&#13;
supplied by the Czech industry for domestic needs were classified as defective&#13;
and were subject to complaints and claims by consumers. In the same year, the&#13;
Czech media reported that many domestically manufactured passenger cars&#13;
remained unsold because of unsatisfactory quality and outmoded styling.&#13;
East v. West in Productivity&#13;
The deficiencies of the centrally planned systems show up in&#13;
aggregate indicators of dynamic efficiency. One aggregate indicator of&#13;
technological performance is total factor productivity (TFP), the productivity&#13;
of all inputs combined. During the period covering roughly 1950-65, the&#13;
growth of TFP in the Soviet and Eastern European economies averaged 2.5&#13;
percent a year, compared with 2.7 percent a year in developed market economies&#13;
and 2.0 percent in developing countries. (The figure for centrally planned&#13;
economies is only for the manufacturing sector, which generally has faster TFP&#13;
growth than the total economy.)&#13;
More recent comparisons of the Soviet Union with western economies&#13;
reach three broad conclusions. First, the level of TFP (static efficiency) in&#13;
the Soviet Union is generally lower than tlhat in the United States and Western&#13;
Europe, with the possible exception of Italy. Second, the growth of TFP in&#13;
the Soviet Union has been comparable to that of the United States and United&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Kingdom, but generally lower than that in the rest of Western Europe and&#13;
Japan, which have been catching up with the U.S. The Soviet rate of (total&#13;
factor) productivity growth measured in real national income per unit of&#13;
factors in 1955-70 was 2.4 percent a year (Bergson 1978). Although this rate&#13;
is higher than 1.6 percent in the United States and 1.8 percent in Great&#13;
Britain, two already advanced countries, it falls well short of Japan (5.9&#13;
percent) and Italy (4.4 percent), two other industrial latecomers. The Soviet&#13;
rate was also lower than that of France (3.9 percent) and West Germany (3.4&#13;
percent). Third, the growth rate of TFP in the Soviet Union has steadily&#13;
declined since the late 1950s. Bergson (1983) reveals that Soviet&#13;
productivity increases were close to those of the western productivity leaders&#13;
only during the first postwar years, after which Soviet performance&#13;
worsened. The deterioration of productivity growth in the Soviet Union has&#13;
continued since, with the rates for the late 1970s well below 1 percent a&#13;
year. Overall, these studies suggest that the Soviet Union --unlike Japan and&#13;
most of Western Europe -- has been generally unsuccessful in closing the&#13;
technological gap with the United States.&#13;
Other good data available for a direct comparison of two countries,&#13;
one from the East and one from the West, are those on the relative labor&#13;
productivity of the Hungarian and Austrian economies (Roman 1979, pp. 313-30;&#13;
Boguszewski 1979, p. 31). Hungary has been one of few Eastern European&#13;
countries interested in continuous observation of changes in its productivity&#13;
relative to other eastern countries and to western economies. The best&#13;
country to compare Hungary with is Austria, because of its historical ties&#13;
with Hungary and the similarities in the scale of economic potentials and in&#13;
the demographic situation (mature and almost stagnant populations).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Data for the early 1970s show that the labor productivity in&#13;
Austria's basic industries represented 140 percent of that in Hungary&#13;
(France's was 208 percent). The biggest difference was in mining, where the&#13;
Austrian productivity was 250 percent of that in Hungary. Respective figures&#13;
were 170 percent in gas and electricity, 150 percent in the machinery&#13;
industry, and 135 percent in chemicals. The smallest differences were in&#13;
textiles, where the Austrian labor productivity was only 15 percent higher&#13;
than Hungary's. The only important sector in which Hungary had an edge (15&#13;
percent) was food processing.&#13;
Hungary, with its mixed system, performs above the average for the&#13;
region. This is suggested, among other things, by data on patents granted by&#13;
western countries to Eastern Europe. The time series of western patents,&#13;
1967-82, indicates that Hungary was the only country in the region which&#13;
radically increased its patenting in western countries in the second part of&#13;
that period. The number of patents was twice as high in 1972-78 as during&#13;
1967-72. Hungary also reports the highest number of western patents per&#13;
capita (Poznanski 1984).&#13;
A higher pace of technological change has helped Hungary to improve&#13;
the technological content of its exports more during the postreform years than&#13;
other East Europeans and the Soviet Union. For instance, Hungary has been&#13;
much more successful in increasing the share of machinery and transport&#13;
equipment in total exports to western countries -- at the expense of less&#13;
technologically complex manufactures and rionmanufactured products. Hungary&#13;
increased this share from 6 percent in 1970 to 13 percent in 1980, whereas for&#13;
the region as a whole (including the Soviet Union) it was 8 percent in both&#13;
1970 and 1980. Hungary was also paid, per kilogram of its products, an&#13;
average price 70 percent higher than the other Eastern Europeans and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Soviet Union. That also reflects, at least partly, its superior technological&#13;
performance (Poznanski 1982).&#13;
But these data reflect some nonsystemic factors as well. One is that&#13;
Hungary is traditionally more dependent on foreign trade and therefore is&#13;
under stronger pressure to expand and optimize its exports, say, through&#13;
providing patent protection for goods sold outside. Moreover, Hungary is&#13;
relatively poor in natural resources, so it has to focus its production on&#13;
less material-intensive items -- those with higher prices per kilogram. One&#13;
can also speculate that Hungary, as a small-scale economy, has to be more&#13;
careful in foculsing its production, and is more pressed to improve existing&#13;
technology in order to avoid losses in foreign markets. So, Hungary's&#13;
technological performance is superior to that of other centrally planned&#13;
economies in the East, for systemic and nonsystemic reasons. Nevertheless, it&#13;
is worse than that of Austria, which is by no means a productivity leader in&#13;
the West.&#13;
East v. West in Technology&#13;
Of the many studies of the technological gap between the centrally&#13;
planned economies and the industrial West, the most comprehensive is by Amann&#13;
and his colleagues at Birmingham University (Amann, Cooper, and Davies&#13;
1978). Among their key conclusions is that Soviet is ahead of or even with&#13;
that of the United States in only a few sectors -- in a few traditional&#13;
industries, such as steel-making, and particularly in some military&#13;
industries, such as conventional weaponry. For instance, Soviet tanks were&#13;
superior to the western models in the 1940s and 1950s. But in the 1960s the&#13;
western powers had moved ahead, onLy to have new Soviet efforts destroy this&#13;
lead. In ballistic missiles the Soviet Union was behind the West in the 1960s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
and early 1970s, but two new generations of ICBMs have helped the Soviets&#13;
close the technological gap, at least for the moment (Halloway 1983, 276-307).&#13;
But the Amann study revealed that the Soviet Union lags far behind&#13;
the most advanced western countries in most civilian technologies. These&#13;
include many consumer industries, passenger cars, and chemicals. In computer&#13;
production (particularLy peripherals) the Soviet Union remains 10 to 15 years&#13;
behind the West, both in technology incorporated in their domestically&#13;
designed models and in the stock of computers in use. While computers of the&#13;
second generation made up all the computer stock in the United States in 1960,&#13;
the Soviet Union reached this share only in 1975 (Goodman 1984). By that&#13;
time, most of this generation of computers were replaced in the United States&#13;
by third generation units (those based on integrated circuit technology).&#13;
The Amann study is instructive, but it goes only to the early&#13;
1970s. The most recent update of this study (Cooper 1984) shows that the&#13;
original picture still applies. The Soviet industry lagged seven years behind&#13;
in third-generation computers and is now behind the United States in the&#13;
production of personal computers by at least five years. For another example,&#13;
the Soviets launched the first commercial production of microprocessors in&#13;
1976, four years after the United States. And its first 64K dynamic random-&#13;
access memory was brought to production in 1983, compared with 1978 in the&#13;
United States (see table 4).&#13;
Nor has there been much improvement in the speed of diffusion in the&#13;
Soviet Union of a once implemented technology. Cooper shows that the Soviet&#13;
Union appears in the 1970s to have been irnproving its diffusion in modern&#13;
chemicals, pulp and paper, nuclear power, and color television sets. This&#13;
improvement can be attributed, however, to the slowdown among the western&#13;
nations and their gradual switch to even newer technologies. Moreover, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
some industries (iron and steel) Soviet performance has deteriorated in&#13;
relative terms. To illustrate, the share of continuously cast steel in total&#13;
Soviet output was 6.9 percent in 1975, when this share for Great Britain was&#13;
8.4 percent, only a quarter higher. In 1982 the Soviet share was 12.1&#13;
percent, while the British share was 38.9 percent, three times more. The&#13;
Soviet lag in part reflects continued investment in new plants using outmoded&#13;
Bessemer and open-hearth technology.&#13;
The evidence provided by Cooper leads to the general conclusion that&#13;
the recent effort by the Soviet Union to reduce the technological gap by&#13;
extensive borrowing of western technology has not been successful. A similar&#13;
observation can be drawn from several recent case studies. Goodman (1981)&#13;
shows for the computer industry, among the priority sectors of the Soviet&#13;
economy in the last decade, that this effort helped the Soviet Union reduce&#13;
the gap only slightly -- or at least prevent the gap from widening in the mid-&#13;
1970s. But the gap began recently to widen again due to an abrupt&#13;
acceLeration of technological advances among western manufacturers (personal&#13;
computers and radical changes in the parameters of computer chips).&#13;
A look at branches of industry that have acquired large amounts of&#13;
western technology nevertheless shows that most of them have gone through a&#13;
tremendous technological transformation. For instance, in passenger cars,&#13;
countries such as Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union have moved from poorly&#13;
organized production of old vintage models to mass manufacturing of western-&#13;
licensed models, with a technology at least fifteen years ahead of the&#13;
traditional, domestically designed models. Similar progress has been reported&#13;
by the chemical industries, particularly in modern petrochemicals. Many&#13;
countries in the region (such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia) increased the&#13;
shares of plastics and other petrochemical products in the production of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
chemicals to equal those of the leading western producers, including West&#13;
Germany.&#13;
East Germany is often viewed as the most technologically advanced&#13;
country in the region, but it is not much closer to the western level of&#13;
technology than the other economies. Little systematic work has been done to&#13;
measure the distance between East Germany and the other countries of the&#13;
region, or that between East Germany and the West. But there are reasons to&#13;
believe that even if East Germany has kept a technological lead over more&#13;
backward countries in the region, this difference has probably diminished in&#13;
the last few years. All the available indicators -- such as relative export-&#13;
unit prices, the share of machinery and transport equipment in total exports&#13;
to western countries, or the absolute volume of trade with western economies&#13;
-- seem to support this statement.&#13;
A look at products designated by planners to serve as "export&#13;
locomotives" suggests that progress has been made in only a few cases, such as&#13;
the Soviet expansion in chemicals destined for western markets (ammonia). But&#13;
the Soviet Union invested a lot in building up export capacity in the car&#13;
industry, with only limited initial success. Recent data show that the Soviet&#13;
exports stagnated a few years ago, mostly because western customers are less&#13;
concerned with the prices of cars and more concerned with the running costs.&#13;
Soviet cars -- fuel-inefficient and often poorly-built -- cannot compete with&#13;
more advanced cars in western markets.&#13;
East v. NICs in Technology&#13;
Neither the study by Amann, Cooper, and Davies nor its update by&#13;
Cooper give information on how successful the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe&#13;
have been relative to other economies that are trying to catch up with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
West: that is, the economies of Asia and Latin America. Poznanski (1984) has&#13;
recently done this kind of comparison in a study that compares Eastern Europe&#13;
-- mostly ignored in the earlier comparisons -- and a group of the newly&#13;
industrializing countries: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Taiwan, Hong Kong,&#13;
South Korea, and Singapore.&#13;
The most spectacular change in relative technological levels has been&#13;
in machinery and transport equipment, a fact well reflected in exports. Latin&#13;
American saLes of these goods represented 54 percent of Eastern European&#13;
exports in 1970, but 216 percent in 1981. The share of Eastern Europe in OECD&#13;
imports of machinery and transport equipment (which are technologically more&#13;
complex than other trade goods) increased from 0.1 percent in 1970 to 0.7&#13;
percent in 1980, while that of the six newly industrializing countries&#13;
increased from 0.1 percent to 4.1 percent over the same period. The newly&#13;
industrializing countries were also paid higher prices than the Eastern&#13;
Europeans and the Soviet Union for their exports of similar goods to the&#13;
West. East Germany received $1.69 per kilogram of its passenger cars exported&#13;
to the OECD in 1980, Czechoslovakia $2.18. Brazil was getting $3.58 per&#13;
kilogram, and Mexico $4.58 in the same year. The price advantage of the newly&#13;
industrializing countries was more or less the same for tires, engines,&#13;
footwear, rotary electric generators, and textile machinery.&#13;
East European exporters have performed less well on the OECD market&#13;
than Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina -- both groups representing similar&#13;
economic potential. In all major product categories -- chemicals (SITC-5),&#13;
manufactured goods (SITC-6), machinery and transport equipment (SITC-7), and&#13;
miscellaneous manufactures (SITC-8) -- the three Latin American economies had&#13;
a far smaller share of exports to the OECD than did Eastern Europe in 1970.&#13;
Except in chemicals, Latin America either either eliminated the initial gap by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
1981 or built a visible edge over Eastern Europe in its exports to the West.&#13;
Some case-study evidence reinforces the trade data (see Poznanski&#13;
1983, p. 313). While gradually reducing the difference in scale of steel&#13;
production, the newly industrializing countries have moved more rapidly than&#13;
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the application of several newer steel-&#13;
making technologies. Brazil increased its share of steel made with the oxygen&#13;
process in the total output of steel from 10 percent in 1960 to 63 percent in&#13;
1979, and South Korea reached 70 percent by 1979. In contrast, the share of&#13;
this technology in the Soviet Union increased from 3 percent in 1960 to 29&#13;
percent in 1979; in East Germany it reached only 9 percent in 1979. Countries&#13;
like Argentina and Brazil are also more advanced in the use of continuous&#13;
casting technology, even though they switched to this process at about the&#13;
same time as the major Eastern European steel makers (early 1960s).&#13;
Even more dramatic is the slow pace of technological advance in the&#13;
Soviet and Eastern European consumer electronics industries, probably the&#13;
outcome of a deliberate policy choice. The scale of production of most of&#13;
these goods in the newly industrializing countries largely exceeds that of&#13;
Eastern Europe, and in many cases that of the Soviet Union as well. Moreover,&#13;
the production in newly industrializing countries by and large represents&#13;
higher technological level. For instance, electronic (digitaL and quartz)&#13;
watches represented only 8 percent of the total output of this product in the&#13;
Soviet Union in 1980, while more than half of Taiwan and Hong Kong's watches&#13;
were based on electronic technology. The share of color television sets in&#13;
total production was 50 percent in East Germany in 1981, 37 percent in the&#13;
Soviet Union in 1982, and 11 percent in PoLand in 1980. In South Korea the&#13;
share for 1983 was 95 percent.&#13;
In computers, on the other hand, Eastern European countries continue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
to have a clear lead in the volume of production of central processors and&#13;
peripherals. And these countries have moved quickly in some areas, again&#13;
probably the outcome of a deliberate policy choice. Among the success stories&#13;
in Bulgarian industry is the production of computers and peripherals, a small&#13;
activity a decade ago and now a large one. This new sector provides much for-&#13;
eign currency and is expected to finance the whole oil and gas bill to the&#13;
Soviet Union in the coming years. In contrast, a large investment in the much&#13;
more experienced Polish industry has not produced similarly good results, for&#13;
only a few computer systems are sold each year (Mundie and Goodman 1981). But&#13;
some newly industrial countries -- such as Brazil -- are making technological-&#13;
ly more advanced models, mostly of western origin, even with their lower&#13;
production. Moreover, many of the newly developing countries operate much&#13;
larger computer stocks than the Eastern Europeans (Poznanski 1984). The&#13;
number of computers in use in all of Eastern Europe was estimated at 8,000 in&#13;
1980, while Brazil alone had around 10,000 systems, and Mexico 15,000.&#13;
In all stages of technological change, from inventive activity to the&#13;
phasing out of an obsolete product or process, the centrally planned economies&#13;
face problems that are far greater than those reported by the industrial&#13;
market economies. As a result, the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern&#13;
Europe have, as industrial latecomers, continued to lag behind the West in&#13;
their technology. And despite their investment of greater shares of their&#13;
national income in research, these countries have also failed to show any&#13;
advantage in productivity growth. At the same time, the newly industrializing&#13;
countries, with their quasi market systems and greater openness to the world&#13;
economy, have succeeded in reducing their technological lag relative to&#13;
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in many critical industries and in getting&#13;
closer to the technological level in the West.&#13;

IV. What Explains the Lacklustre Performance&#13;
What systemic factors might account for the technological performance in&#13;
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union? Why has the latest wave of reforms not&#13;
greatly improved efficiency in the region? I conclude by trying to determine&#13;
which features of central planning inhibit technological change and, hence,&#13;
productivity growth. Sought here is an analytical framework for explaining&#13;
the effects of central planning on technological change.&#13;
Risk-reward Explanation&#13;
There is a long tradition in the western literature of blaming the&#13;
resistance that enterprise managers have toward technological changes on the&#13;
highly uncertain environment in which they operate. Even though these&#13;
managers do not face sudden changes in consumer taste or switches in demand to&#13;
close substitutess, they are continuously confronted with risks following the&#13;
insistence by central planners on exact fulfillment of annual targets set for&#13;
total production and the output of some goods. This insistence makes managers&#13;
afraid of the uncertainties that are typically associated with any major&#13;
technological effort, for it puts state-run enterprises in a riskier situation&#13;
than that of market enterprises, which have a wide range of acceptable&#13;
outcomes, with output less important than profit.&#13;
Another feature of central planning that makes technological change&#13;
particularly risky for industrial enterprises is the tendency among planners&#13;
to demand uninterrupted increases in the volume of production and in supplies&#13;
of specific goods (Grossman 1966, pp. 118-29). Plan targets for upcoming&#13;
periods are generally extrapolations of previous performance, so enterprises&#13;
that perform well in one plan period are likely to be given new targets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
demanding an increase in production of at least the same magnitude. Faced&#13;
with this planning practice, enterprise managers may be unwilling even to&#13;
introduce technologies that pose little difficulty, for moving the enterprise&#13;
failing the targets corrected continuously upward in the next plan periods.&#13;
A complementary statement that usually accompanies this argument on&#13;
excessive risk is that state-run enterprises do not take risks because rewards&#13;
are insufficient for enterprises and individuals to compensate for the risks&#13;
of engaging in technological change. Even though many in number, the various&#13;
rewards offered to Soviet enterprises are not high enough, particularly when&#13;
compared with the attractiveness of bonuses related to other goals, often in&#13;
direct conflict with the innovative effort (Berliner 1976). In addition, the&#13;
innovation record is viewed as less important than other indicators of&#13;
performance for promotions and changes of wage groups.&#13;
The problem with this risk-reward explanation of low innovativeness&#13;
is that its basis is an incomplete picture of the centrally planned economy.&#13;
It implies a rigidity of planning that does not exist. In fact, enterprises&#13;
sometimes operate with no clear plan targets, particularly when there is a&#13;
delay in setting goals for the coming plan period. More important, confirmed&#13;
targets are subject to revisions by branch ministries and higher authority&#13;
when there is an indication that plan will not be fulfilled or when increases&#13;
in production are possible. In some cases, such as Poland during 1976-79, the&#13;
planning is so soft that it is more random than rigid (Montias 1983, pp.l-37).&#13;
The consequences of not meeting production targets are not as severe&#13;
as assumed in the risk-reward explanation. The most that sanctions for&#13;
failure involve are personnel changes for upper management staff. There is&#13;
not much evidence, however, that top managers are always punished for failing&#13;
to meet the plan, regardless of the reason (whether an unsuccessful innovation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
has led to this failure, or a more trivial mistake, or just bad luck in&#13;
routine activities). In most cases, the rules of the party "nomenklature"&#13;
prevent failing managers from being severely punished. At worst, managers are&#13;
rotated to other, often equally respectable, positions. The risk-reward&#13;
explanation also underestimates the ability of enterprises to present their&#13;
failures as successes. Enterprises can redefine failures as successes,&#13;
however socially inefficient they may be. They also are frequently in a&#13;
position to make prices cover manufacturing costs, which again helps managers&#13;
to avoid the risk of failing with an innQvation.&#13;
Zero-price Explanation&#13;
An alternative explanation -- integrating some of the aforementioned&#13;
observations on the true nature of planning -- relates the weak interest of&#13;
state-run enterprises for technological change to the system's inability to&#13;
make enterprises cost-conscious (Kornai 1'980, pp. 231-46). The soft budget&#13;
constraint makes state-run enterprises less sensitive than market-type&#13;
enterprises to the costs of production. The budget is not binding for the&#13;
state enterprises, since most of their production factors are provided at what&#13;
effectively are zero prices. Capital investment is financed through budget&#13;
subsidies or "credits" that do not have to be repaid on strict terms. And&#13;
when faced with difficulties, the enterprises are in most cases rescued&#13;
through the provision of additional resources or the relaxation of production&#13;
targets or budget repayments, so there is no fear of bankruptcy.&#13;
Hungary is the only country that has started openly arguing for the&#13;
reinstitution of bankruptcy. A fear of bankrupty can make enterprises exploit&#13;
all possible ways of increasing their efficiency. This view, heretical by&#13;
Soviet and Eastern European standards, has many opponents in the Hungarian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
leadership. Managers of enterprises are accustomed to a paternalistic&#13;
relationship with the central planners, who as a rule help out during periods&#13;
of financial difficulty. The trade unions, enjoying some freedom from party&#13;
control -- unlike their counterparts in other countries of the region -- are&#13;
not sympathetic to change either, as they worry about the fate of workers&#13;
employed by enterprises going-out-of-business.&#13;
So far, the bankruptcy legislation in Hungary is soft, and the state&#13;
does not use its right to declare chronically deficit enterprises bankrupt&#13;
very often. According to the law, a state-run enterprise can be pronounced&#13;
bankrupt only after it has been given time for necessary "rescue&#13;
adjustments." Hungarian firms receive direct subsidies and tax exemptions --&#13;
reaching up to 40 percent of the production costs in most industry (Szabo&#13;
1974, p. 7). This helps many inefficient enterprises to show profits, so they&#13;
do not qualify for the bankruptcy procedure, even though they deserve it. In&#13;
this permissive environment, only 10 Hungarian enterprises of 1,735 showed a&#13;
loss in 1980, a crisis year in Hungary. Eleven enterprises were ordered to&#13;
merge with others, and 13 enterprises were liquidated, numbers higher than in&#13;
any year before, but still too low considering the real losses incurred by&#13;
ill-managed enterprises (Kornai 1983).&#13;
Paralleling the lack of strong concern for production costs is a lack&#13;
of concern for meeting real demands. The lack of concern for cost-saving&#13;
creates unbalanced commodity markets. The buyers are forced to fight for&#13;
superior goods, and producers with secure long-term markets do not have to&#13;
innovate to stimulate demand for their goods. There is overwhelming evidence&#13;
of inability to meet consumer demands in the late 1960s (Kornai 1971, pp. 242-&#13;
44). In Hungary only 22 to 33 percent of the orders placed for the most&#13;
desirable cars were met in 1968. The ratio for telephones was around 33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
percent, and for most clothing and shoes it ranged between 70 and 94 percent&#13;
in the same year. Similar analysis for the late 1970s shows that this gap&#13;
between demand and effective supply, though diminished, continues to be&#13;
substantial. The waiting period for apartments was seven years in 1979 (in&#13;
Poland, 10 to 12 years). For passenger cars the lag between initial or full&#13;
payments and delivery was five years (Kornai 1984).&#13;
These permanent shortages are also reflected in a time-consuming&#13;
buying process. A rare analysis of the time-budget in a sample of Polish&#13;
families shows that shopping for food and cooking takes an average of two to&#13;
three hours a day. And faced with a lack of the most desired articles, many&#13;
consumers settle for less demanded substitutes. The Hungarian study shows&#13;
that more than half of female buyers are forced to purchase shoes other than&#13;
the most desirable. They have to buy winter shoes in summer time, or fashions&#13;
and colors other than those desired at the time of purchase (Kornai 1984).&#13;
The lack of stimulus for cost minimization and for meeting real&#13;
demands puts the state enterprises in a situation where they do not really&#13;
need to innovate, at least not to undertake cost-reducing changes or to meet&#13;
desired standards and qualities. In other words, it is not so much the fear&#13;
of failing with innovation as the weak pressure to economize on resources that&#13;
turns enterprises away from potential innovations. For the same reason, any&#13;
efforts made do not have to be optimal. Thus the "zero-price" explanation&#13;
answers questions about both reasons for the low frequency of innovations and&#13;
about the factors behind inefficient technological changes.&#13;
Closed-economy Explanation&#13;
The risk-reward and zero-price explanations have a common element:&#13;
they see systemic deficiencies in relation to an ideally operating closed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
economy. This perception neglects many technological opportunities available&#13;
through participation in the world economy, including direct involvement by&#13;
foreign economic agents. Therefore, one should also try to evaluate the&#13;
systemic deficiencies from the viewpoint of how the existing system affects&#13;
the ability of the region to benefit from external resources.&#13;
Technological change is more international than it was in earlier&#13;
decades: that is, many more economies are approaching and extending the&#13;
technological frontiers for many products and processes. Moreover, the newest&#13;
technologies typically are transferred commercially only through direct&#13;
operations by foreign companies in a host country (Mansfield and others&#13;
1979). There is also some evidence that subsidiaries help in promoting the&#13;
rapid diffusion of foreign technology in the country (Chen 1983, pp. 309-&#13;
21). Technological change can also be seen as more international now than&#13;
before in the sense that an increasing number of producers, even those&#13;
representing relatively large scale, have to rely on a wide network of foreign&#13;
suppliers -- incorporating necessary technology -- to build a competitive&#13;
product. To achieve this goal, companies subcontract the production of&#13;
certain parts and components, and sign long-term contracts on such deliveries&#13;
from abroad. They also enter cooperation agreements with technologically&#13;
strong partners to assemble one product, or its modifications, in the&#13;
different localities (in some cases including joint marketing of their&#13;
products).&#13;
A look at the literature on technological change by Soviet and&#13;
Eastern European authors shows that the international aspects of technological&#13;
development go unnoticed. Only one such aspect -- the need to import&#13;
technology from other countries -- is widely recognized. But even these&#13;
imports are seen mainly as a temporary measure rather than a permanent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
solution. There is even less discussion on the way existing systemic&#13;
arrangements affect possibilities for taking part in the international side of&#13;
technological change. The impact of the system on overall, not just&#13;
technological, relations with the outside world is downplayed in an old-&#13;
fashioned way. Systemic changes are seen not as essential but as corrective&#13;
measures -- aimed at stimulating domestic competitiveness without breaking the&#13;
existing monopolies, providing some countercyclical dampers, or widening the&#13;
basis for determining prices for domestic goods.&#13;
Under the existing system, decision-makers at all levels of the&#13;
bureaucratic machinery view contacts with other economies as unworthy of a&#13;
strong effort or even as detrimental to such goals as the fulfillment of&#13;
annual output targets by state enterprises. The system also determines prices&#13;
independent of world prices. The implication of this is that calculations in&#13;
domestic prices -- to the extent that such prices affect technological effort&#13;
-- divert that effort from trajectories that are promising for developing a&#13;
competitive industrial structure. For instance, some economists claim that&#13;
underpriced labor inputs cause these economies to concentrate too much effort&#13;
on labor-intensive products, in which they cannot compete with the labor-&#13;
abundant developing countries. This by itself may reduce the attractiveness&#13;
of closer contacts with eastern enterprises for the potential partners in the&#13;
West or elsewhere. This inward-looking character of the system in the Soviet&#13;
Union and Eastern Europe is an important additional explanation for the&#13;
region's losing its technological edge over the newly industrializing&#13;
countries in several key manufacturing branches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
V. Conclusions&#13;
The way allocative decisions are made under central planning strongly affects&#13;
the motivation of state-owned enterprises and research establishments to&#13;
engage in technological change. The allocative mechanism puts these agents in&#13;
a situation where productive factors have zero prices, a situation that&#13;
inspires little interest in cost-reducing innovations or in innovations aimed&#13;
at quality improvements. The lack of interest in quality improvements is&#13;
reinforced by the weak influence of buyers, particularly consumers, on&#13;
allocative decisions. The allocative system also isolates national agents&#13;
from the influence of the world economy, delaying their reactions to global&#13;
changes in relative scarcity and in tastes.&#13;
Based on the results of past tinkering, the Soviet Union and the&#13;
countries of Eastern Europe will have to undertake major reforms of the&#13;
fundamental principles governing the allocation and use of resources. Reforms&#13;
limited to changes in the organization and administrative procedures for&#13;
research and enterprises -- accompanied by minor improvements in such things&#13;
as prices, bonus systems, technological targets, and procedures for technology&#13;
imports -- have absorbed much of the energy spent on systemic changes over the&#13;
last decade. But these have not been sufficient to bring about big&#13;
improvements in technological performance. Broader reforms to redesign the&#13;
allocative system -- perhaps following the first steps by Hungary, the most&#13;
technologically successful country in the region -- are needed to bring such&#13;
improvements about. But even the Hungarians will probably have to consider&#13;
more fundamental reforms, if they are to bring their performance up to that in&#13;
the West.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This survey looks at the relationship
            between economic performance and the environment for
            technological change in centrally planned economies to draw
            some lessons about what is needed for successful
            development. The lessons are drawn from the experience of
            the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe,
            countries with the most experience in trying to manage
            technological change under a centrally planned system. The
            lessons are important for developing countries that have
            either centrally planned economies or mixed economies that
            combine aspects of central planning and market allocation.
            The main lesson is that reforms limited to changes in the
            organization and admininstration of research -- accompanied
            by minor improvements in such things as diffusion targets,
            bonus sytems in enterprises, and procedures for technology
            imports -- are not enough to bring about big improvements in
            technological performance. What these economies seem to need
            to accelerate the pace of technological progress is a reform
            of the fundamental principles governing the allocation and
            use of productive resources.
