(c)    The Contribution is being provided in installments on the basis of financial needs&#13;

forward or to delay them, the installment schedule shall be amended as agreed by&#13;
the Bank and the Donor.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions Applicable to the&#13;
Partnership for Infrastructure Development in the&#13;
West Bank &amp; Gaza Multi Donor Trust Fund&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all agreements entered into&#13;
between the Bank and the Donors that provide Contributions to be administered by the Bank for&#13;
the Trust Fund.&#13;
1.    Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1.  The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth&#13;
in this Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary&#13;
or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the IBRD and IDA under their Articles of&#13;
Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2.  The Contribution shall be administered in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies&#13;
and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time, including its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank&#13;
resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the&#13;
relevant decisions of the Security Council, taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United&#13;
Nations. The Donor acknowledges that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank&#13;
under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of&#13;
an individual member country that may apply to the Donor, nor shall it be deemed a waiver,&#13;
express or implied, of any of the privileges and immunities of the Bank.&#13;
2.     Commingling, Exchange and Investment of the Contributions&#13;
2.1.   The Contributions shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept separate&#13;
and apart from the funds of the Bank. The Contributions may be commingled with other trust&#13;
fund assets maintained by the Bank.&#13;
2.2.   The Contributions may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as may&#13;
facilitate their disbursement.&#13;
2.3.   The Bank shall invest and reinvest the Contributions pending their disbursement in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds&#13;
administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust&#13;
Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.     Administrative Cost Recovery&#13;
3.1.   In order to assist in the defrayment of the costs of administration and other expenses&#13;
incurred by the Bank under this Agreement, the Bank may deduct and retain for its own account&#13;
an amount equal to two percent (2%) of each Contribution. In addition, costs for program&#13;
management as defined in Annex I up to a maximum of three percent (3%) of each Contribution&#13;
will be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis. If the contributions increase beyond what&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

administrative fee may be applied to such new contributions.&#13;

Annex 1 consistent with the purposes of this Agreement and on the terms and conditions set forth&#13;
in the Grant Agreements. Grant Agreements may be entered into up to the maximum amount of&#13;
the Contributions that all Donors have agreed to make available under the Administration&#13;
Agreements between the Bank and the Donors. Upon request by a Donor, the Bank shall furnish a&#13;
copy of the Grant Agreements to the Donors.&#13;
4.2.   The Bank shall be responsible for the supervision of the activities financed under the&#13;
Grant Agreements. Subject to the consent of the Recipient, representatives of the Donors may be&#13;
invited by the Bank to participate in Bank supervision missions related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
4.3.   The Bank shall promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to the terms&#13;
of any Grant Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under&#13;
any Grant Agreements. To the extent practicable, the Bank shall afford the Donors the&#13;
opportunity to exchange views before effecting any such modification or exercising any such&#13;
remedy.&#13;
5.     Procurement&#13;
5.1.   For Recipient-executed activities, the Grant Agreements shall provide that the&#13;
Contributions shall be used by the Recipient to finance expenditures for goods and services, as&#13;
the case may be, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on "Procurement under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits" and the Bank's Guidelines on the "Selection and Employment of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers," as in effect at the date of entry into the respective Grant Agreements.&#13;
5.2.   For Bank-executed activities, the employment and supervision of any consultants and the&#13;

and shall be carried out in accordance with its applicable policies and procedures.&#13;

opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
6.4.   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to&#13;
whether such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the&#13;
appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and&#13;

the Bank shall agree on the scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall&#13;
provide all relevant information within the limits of its policies and procedures. All associated&#13;
costs shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not&#13;
constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
8.     Disbursement: Cancellation: Refund&#13;
8.1.    The Contributions may be used to retroactively finance payments for eligible&#13;
expenditures in accordance with the Bank's policies and procedures from June 4, 2012.&#13;
