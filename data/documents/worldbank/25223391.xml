      GUIDANCE NOTE ON ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE&#13;
          FOR THE SAVA RIVER BASIN â&#128;&#147; HYDROPOWER&#13;
&#13;
1         Introduction&#13;
This report provides guidance note for decision making on the adaptation needs related to hydropow-&#13;
er in the Sava River Basin (SRB). This guidance note is one of the components of the Water and Cli-&#13;
mate Adaptation Plan (WATCAP) being prepared by the Consultant for the International Sava River&#13;
Basin Commission (ISRBC) under World Bank funding.1 It builds on the main WATCAP report (World&#13;
Bank, 2013b), the report on the development of future climate scenarios (Vujadinovic and Vukovic,&#13;
2013) and on the report on development of the hydrologic model for the Sava River basin (World&#13;
Bank, 2013a). Thus, the guidance note is designed to provide fundamental and flexible instruction on&#13;
how to conduct impact and vulnerability assessments in the energy sector, specifically for hydropower&#13;
facilities along with identification opportunities and entry points for integration of climate change miti-&#13;
gation and adaptation measures into the hydropower energy (HPE) sector processes.&#13;
&#13;
An eminent example upon which this guidance note on the hydropower sector is based is The Inte-&#13;
grated Water and Energy Nexus Study (IWENS) for the Vrbas Basin, a tributary of the Sava River&#13;
(see Figure 1), that represents a snapshot of the complex and integrated use, development and man-&#13;
agement of water resources, in order to meet the water needs of multiple users and their future har-&#13;
monization as well as adapting to climate change.2&#13;

Â &#13;
In order to provide proper information about climate change impact on the hydropower sector various&#13;
analysis were performed with useful results that define an adaptation strategy direction. Similarly,&#13;
though less extensive analysis is done for the purpose of completing this Adaptation Guidance note&#13;
and also by giving an example for conducting a more profound and detailed analysis in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2            Climate change impact on Hydropower â&#128;&#147; Vulnerability Screening&#13;
Climate change (CC) impact on the hydropower sector is mainly seen in the effects on power genera-&#13;
tion potential. Hydropower production would either be positively or adversely affected, depending on&#13;
the CC effects and how are they managed. Change of three climate parameters as a consequence of&#13;
CC should be analysed, namely: precipitation, temperatures and evaporation/evapotranspiration (ET).&#13;
These three parameters are all important components of the hydrological cycle that affects river dis-&#13;
charge, which in turn is a major input to power generation calculation.&#13;
Consequently, major projected climate change impacts on the HPE sector are:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Decreased or increased HP generation potential due to more or less precipitation and conse-&#13;
    quently more or less river runoff;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Reduced or increased energy demand for heating or cooling, with regard to CC by means of high-&#13;
    er or lower air temperatures;&#13;
ï&#130;·   A decrease or increase of installed flow for facilities changing HPP effectiveness;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Flooding and landslides damage or complete destruction of HP structures (e.g. dams, transmis-&#13;
    sion and distribution networks) that may create conflict with downstream communities, increase&#13;
    social vulnerability e.g. through involuntary resettlement; and&#13;
ï&#130;·   Energy security and economic development activities will be compromised and production costs&#13;
    will increase.&#13;
&#13;
Major vulnerability of hydropower plants and systems to CC lies in change of key parameters for&#13;
power production, because they are directly linked to climate parameters. Key parameters whose&#13;
change would largely affect hydropower production are:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   River discharge or mean flow and on specific dam profiles: a significant change would affect pro-&#13;
    duction in the same direction;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Duration curves or a fluctuation of discharge in one time period (i.e. year, season,â&#128;¦) for the dam&#13;
    profile: a change would affect the change in total volume used for production and in the same&#13;
    manner production by itself;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Evaporation/ET would affect volume of available water for production.&#13;
&#13;
Some characteristics of hydropower facilities affect their vulnerability to climate change. For instance,&#13;
electricity generation capacity relative change would be decreased or increased in a bigger or a&#13;
smaller scale depending on the type of facility, size of the reservoir, etc. The vulnerability of different&#13;
hydropower characteristics to CC are given in Table 1.&#13;
Using the pattern shown in Table 1, it is possible to define adaptation strategies depending on a spe-&#13;
cific situation.&#13;

3                  Scenarios for climate change in Sava River Basin&#13;
Climate change analysis in Sava River Basin starts with simulations of the future hydrologic regime&#13;
using a hydrological model for the SRB developed in HEC-HMS. The future climate scenarios are&#13;
taken from five Global Climate Models (GCM)/Regional Climate Models (RCM) simulations under the&#13;
A1B Special Report on Emissions Scenario (SRES)/Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#13;
(IPCC) scenario and are later in text denoted as climate models -CM1 through CM5. With each cli-&#13;
mate model (CM) daily flows are simulated for three 30-year periods:&#13;
&#13;
1. 1961-1990 (past or baseline climate scenario),&#13;
2. 2011-2040 (near future climate scenario), and&#13;
3. 2041-2070 (distant future climate scenario).&#13;
&#13;
According to work undertaken under this WATCAP study climate change in the Sava River Basin im-&#13;
plies:3&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·      Temperature increase about 1Â°C in the near future and 2.3Â°C in the distant future,&#13;
ï&#130;·      Change of mean annual precipitation ranges between -6% to +4% across the Basin, but seasonal&#13;
       change takes values between -12% to +14% in the near future and as much as -32% to +19% in&#13;
       the distant future, as a mean value for all stations on the Basin. For some parts of the SRB differ-&#13;
       ence is as high as Â±30% in near and Â±40% in the distant future;&#13;
ï&#130;·      Seasonal variability as described by the 5 used climate models (i.e. CM1 to CM5) is not the same&#13;
       for all. Predictions of two climate model for the near future and three for the distant future indicate&#13;
       an increasing precipitation trend will occur in the winter and a decreasing trend in the summer&#13;
       season.&#13;

Â &#13;
Taking the information from Table 1 and the overall climate scenario results for the Sava River Basin&#13;
area overall, the following conclusions can be drawn:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·     With increasing evaporation/ET, due to temperature increase in the future, a bigger decrease of&#13;
      hydropower production is expected to occur on reservoir type and pumped storage type dams&#13;
      with a high storage area/volume ratio and small reservoirs. Other types of HPP would show&#13;
      smaller effects, but still experience a decrease of hydropower generation;&#13;
ï&#130;·     A decrease in river runoff would affect power generation with a reduction on all facilities but in par-&#13;
      ticular with run-of-river schemes in the SRB because they are highly and solely dependent on riv-&#13;
      er runoff; and&#13;
ï&#130;·     Floods in the fall/winter and droughts in the spring/summer would mostly affect run-of-river HPPs&#13;
      and HPP with small reservoirs. With this climate change parameter an overall power generation&#13;
      decrease is expected.&#13;
&#13;
From all of the above it can be concluded that, in the future it would be customary to have lower pow-&#13;
er generation from the hydropower sector on the Sava River Basin from bigger or smaller schemes,&#13;
depending on the region and the HPP facility. The magnitude of the change has been reviewed by&#13;
conducting further analysis through case studies that are described below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4              Case studies - Expected magnitude of climate change impact on&#13;
               Hydropower Sector in Sava River Basin&#13;
In the Sava River Basin there are 20 hydropower plants (HPP) with installed capacity larger than 10&#13;
MW (see Chapter 2.4.5 of this Report)). Four HPPs were selected as case studies for analysis of CC&#13;
impact on energy production. The choice of HPP is made based upon the energy production magni-&#13;
tude and the share in average total energy production in the SRB or in other words upon their signifi-&#13;
cance in the hydropower sector in SRB area. In addition, data needed for analysis were directly avail-&#13;
able from the developed Sava River Basin HEC-HMS Model since for each plant location of those&#13;
four plants there is hydrological station included in model. All four HPPs are reservoir type dams.&#13;

ï&#130;·   All dams are close to dam type and no flow and head losses in the tunnel or penstock are taken&#13;
    into account.&#13;
&#13;
Depending on the available daily flow, the flow through the turbines is calculated as:&#13;
If Qriver ï&#130;£ Qinstalled then Qturbines ï&#128;½ Qriver&#13;
If Qriver ï&#128;¾ Qinstalled then Qturbines ï&#128;½ Qinstalled .&#13;

Energy production is calculated using the formula:&#13;

&#13;
From the above the daily and yearly productions are calculated. The resulting averages for each 30-&#13;
year periodâ&#128;&#153;s energy production for both near and distant future scenarios are compared in relation to&#13;
the baseline scenario (period 1961-1990). The results are given in Figure 2.&#13;

The results for all HPPs in the near future show a small expected change in the average annual ener-&#13;
gy production, with rather small variation between the scenarios except for HPP BoÄ&#141;ac. Based on the&#13;
ensemble median values (as a more robust estimate than the ensemble mean, which might be under&#13;
influence of extreme values in short samples like this one), an increase in the range of 1-1.5% is ex-&#13;

pected at two HPPs on the Drina River (Bajina BaÅ¡ta and Zvornik), and a small decrese is expected&#13;
at HPP BoÄ&#141;ac. HPP Blanca in Slovenia results in 0% change. Greater variation for HPP BoÄ&#141;ac gives&#13;
a power production decrease of 4% with CM4 and an increase of 9% with CM5, thus indicating a&#13;
higher uncertainty related to the Vrbas basin hydrologic simulations and consequently to the derived&#13;
energy production.&#13;
&#13;
For the distant future the variation between the scenarios is greater, which is expected with the simu-&#13;
lation period being further away from the observation period. The energy production is expected to&#13;
change more markedly in this period, between -8% (HPP BoÄ&#141;ac) and +4% (HPP Bajina BaÅ¡ta), alt-&#13;
hough the order of the magnitude of these changes is still in the range of the modelling and meas-&#13;
urement uncertainties. The trend at two HPPs on the Drina River (Bajina BaÅ¡ta and Zvornik) is re-&#13;
versed and their annual energy production is expected to decrease slightly by 1-2%. The decreasing&#13;
trend for HPP BoÄ&#141;ac continues in this period as well, while the energy production at HPP Blanca is&#13;
expected to increase.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the results shown in Figure 2, seasonal energy production variability is analysed for&#13;
HPP Bajina BaÅ¡ta. These results are portrayed in Figure 3. The near future results show greater en-&#13;
ergy production in the winter and fall seasons, while in the spring a decrease in energy production is&#13;
expected. Interestingly, the energy production in the summer season is not expected to change signif-&#13;
icantly. The distant future results show greater decrease in the spring and summer seasons (by 4%&#13;
and 10% on average, respectively), whilst in the winter and fall energy production is expected to in-&#13;
crease by 11% and 5%, respectively, on average.&#13;

5          Adaptation and Mitigation Guidelines&#13;
Although predictions of climate scenarios vary over the SRB and by different scenario, it is likely that&#13;
in the near future no severe alterations of climate that would substantially affect the hydropower sec-&#13;
tor will happen, while in the distant future water availability would decrease and with it energy pro-&#13;
duced in hydropower facilities.&#13;
&#13;
Although the SRB is predicted to have small (near future) and moderate (distant future) decreases in&#13;
overall hydropower production as a consequence of CC, these changes are not expected to be se-&#13;
vere and it is highly unlikely that this would cause detrimental effects on human activities. Further-&#13;
more, there are other green power sources available (e.g. solar, wind etc.) and a lot of possible&#13;
measures for adaptation and mitigation to counteract these CC effects.&#13;
&#13;
Notwithstanding, on average dependence on hydropower energy for all SRB countries is around 45%,&#13;
defined as a percentage of hydropower produced from the total energy used (see Table 3 ). Conse-&#13;
quently, hydropower is very important for the SRB and it follows that work on adaptation and mitiga-&#13;
tion measures should be started now in order to assure proper and timely resilience to climate change&#13;
in the future.&#13;

Adaptation and mitigation options, both structural and non-structural for the estimated climate change&#13;
impact on Sava River Basin are summarized below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.1        Structural adaptation measures&#13;
ï&#130;·   Enhance dam structural parameters-diverting upstream tributaries to decrease river runoff, new&#13;
    reservoir storage, modifying spillways, changing number and/or types of turbines;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Build robust dams with large reservoirs that can cope with extreme events;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Flexible design for installed capacity;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Consideration of planned structural measures before implementation. This includes all uses of the&#13;
    reservoir (e.g. hydroelectricity, irrigation, drinking water supply, tourism, etc.) before reservoir con-&#13;
    struction or enlargement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.2        Non-structural adaptation measures&#13;
ï&#130;·   Consideration of ecological aspects, as structures can generate significant impacts on the water&#13;
    courses (morphological changes, barriers to fish migration, etc.);&#13;
ï&#130;·   Reduce energy demand by promoting public awareness campaigns and training in energy effi-&#13;
    ciency;&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    Page 8&#13;

Â &#13;
ï&#130;·   Improving hydrological forecasting to improve operational rules and utilization of HPP capacity,&#13;
ï&#130;·   Improve operation and maintenance practices at power stations;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Incorporate future reduced or increased generation capacity in design, depending on specific loca-&#13;
    tion on the basin;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Consider using more pumped storage hydropower technology in order to match the energy avail-&#13;
    able to the needs of the consumers and in order to cover peak loads;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Adoption of an integrated water resources and disaster management approach;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Integration of climate change considerations into the management and operation of HE power&#13;
    generation, transmission and distribution system;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Replacement of incandescent bulbs with ones with low energy consumption;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Assess and use other renewable energy production facilities such as wind power or solar power&#13;
    plants;&#13;
ï&#130;·   More profound analysis for most likely estimation of projected climate variations over HPP lifetime;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Identification of cost-effective new designs and modification of existing designs to deal with specif-&#13;
    ic risks for the HPP construction site;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Undertaken regular reviews of permitting and licensing of hydropower schemes to assess river&#13;
    flow regimes and minimum and maximum water levels according to season, to ensure sufficient&#13;
    storage in the reservoir to absorb the spring flood and to tie this into the RBMPs;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Incorporating climate change into existing codes and guidelines concerning hydropower;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Establish a mandatory reporting mechanism for all hydropower companies to provide full opera-&#13;
    tional details on river flow and discharge to improve future monitoring records;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Development of guiding principles on integrating environmental aspects in the use of existing hy-&#13;
    dropower plants such as increase in HPP efficiency, flow regulation, as well as in the planning and&#13;
    construction of new hydropower plants;&#13;
ï&#130;·   Better development / implementation of strict rules (riparian rights) for discharge of water into riv-&#13;
    ers and for water withdrawal.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This report presents the water and
            climate adaptation plan (WATCAP) developed for the Sava
            river basin (SRB) as result of a study undertaken by the
            World Bank. The WATCAP is intended to help to bridge the gap
            between the climate change predictions for the SRB and the
            decision makers in current and planned water management
            investment projects that will be affected by changing
            climate trends. The purpose of the report is to: (i) assist
            stakeholders and decision makers in assessing and planning
            for the risks generated by climate change impacts on water
            resources; (ii) provide a basis for future plans and studies
            of adaptation to climate change impacts in the SRB; and
            (iii) stimulate cooperation and debate across the basin
            toward additional and more detailed studies on climate
            change impacts at the regional and basin scale. The SRB is
            projected to experience small increases in water use by the
            public water supply, industry, energy, and agricultural and
            irrigation sectors. However, it is widely expected that new
            hydropower plants (HPPs) will be constructed in the near
            future, making energy (primarily through hydropower) the
            most important water use in the SRB.
