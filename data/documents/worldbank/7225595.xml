SECTIONA. BACKGROUND&amp; STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
Background. Today's environmentof heightened confrontationand risk in West Bank and Gaza&#13;
(WBG), including the tightening of movement and access restrictions, has led to a severe&#13;
contraction in Palestinian economic activity, particularly over the past 10 months. This, coupled&#13;
with fiscal distress, has contributedto the hardshipand difficulties faced by all Palestinians on a&#13;
daily basis. Damaged infrastructure due to the conflict and, in many cases, the inability to&#13;
maintain, repair and rehabilitate such service infrastructuredue to lack of financing or access to&#13;
it, has severely compromised the ability of central and local agencies to continue rendering&#13;
services to their communities. These circumstances place the average Palestinianin situationsof&#13;
increased exposure to health and sanitation risks (mounting and decomposing solid waste&#13;
throughout heavily populated urban areas), irregular supply of potable water and electricity,&#13;
public safety risks due to unlit and damaged streets, and ongoingdegradation of the environment&#13;
that will affect future generations of Palestinians, in addition to the well-documented&#13;
psychological trauma and post traumatic distress syndrome that is increasingly witnessed in the&#13;
behaviorof children andyouth as a direct consequenceof the ongoingcrisis'.&#13;
&#13;
Sharp Declines in Economic Activity. Border closures have been increasingly tightened as an&#13;
Israeli security measure over recent months and for prolonged periods with uncertainty about&#13;
when they will be lifted or re-imposedthereafter. This has had a dramatic effect on the normal&#13;
conduct of commercial activities. Movement restrictions on goods and people (not only to&#13;
external markets but also to local markets) remainthe foremost binding constraintson economic&#13;
activity, significantly raising uncertainty and the cost of doing business. Palestinian access to&#13;
jobs in Israel, which is a vital component of the Gazan economy has dwindled to negligible&#13;
levels. Over the past few months, trucks carrying goods for export from Gaza have dropped by&#13;
40 percent over the already low level of exports transiting out of Gaza at the beginningof 2005.&#13;
Food supplies and other household commodities have also been held up at border crossingpoints&#13;
resultingin sharp increases inthe pricesof domestic consumables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Unemployment Remains High. Continued restrictions on the passage of goods and people and&#13;
further extensions of the separation wall have severely affected the growth capacity of the&#13;
Palestinianeconomy. Despitesome initial steps toward recovery in 2005, GDP per capita(in real&#13;
terms) remains well its 1999 (pre-Intifada) level. Unemploymentremains severe, at around 25&#13;
percent, compared with 11.9 percent in 1999, pointing to the continued and acute inability of the&#13;
Palestinian economy to fully utilize its productive assets. Gaza has been especially hard hit.&#13;
Almost 19,000 full timejobs were lost in Gaza due to border closures over the past six monthsor&#13;
more than 10 percent of all full timejobs. As jobs in Gaza have disappeared, more of the labor&#13;
force has entered into part-timeemployment, and the number of underemployedin Gazahas risen&#13;
by some 60% over the last six months (and by morethan 80% relativeto Q2 2005).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Poverty Incidence Continues its Upward Trend. With a high population growth rate in WBG&#13;
and declining real per capita incomes, poverty has been on the increase, with the poverty rate&#13;
almost doubling following the outbreak of the Intifada, to an estimated 41 percent by the end of&#13;
2006. Most Palestinians report that they have exhausted prior coping strategies of borrowing&#13;
from families, relatives and friends, purchasing essential household commodities on credit, and&#13;
sellingfamily gold andjewelry to cover the needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IA recent survey by Neareast Consulting (September 2006) found that more than 75 percent ofthe&#13;
Palestinianpopulation in WBG is clinically depressed, noting an increase of 21 percent injust one year,&#13;
with particularly highrates amongrefugeecamp and urban dwellers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
KEYSECTOR Issries&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
water well pumps and electrical generators are operated only intermittently, as the high cost of&#13;
fuel and declining municipal revenues have placed new burdens on municipal budgets. In&#13;
addition, service delivery has been constrained by closures, road-blocks and check-points that&#13;
have prevented service providers from accessing solid waste dumpsites, carrying out routine&#13;
maintenance at wastewater treatment plants and electrical and watedwastewater networks, and&#13;
maintaining regular service schedules to neighborhoods and households.                         Any available&#13;
investment funds that would typically have been devoted to extending infrastructure networks or&#13;
upgrading systems have had to be diverted to building bypass transport routes to circumvent&#13;
closures or repair damages sustained in the electrical distribution systems, water and wastewater&#13;
networks, roads and other basic infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Local Government Revenues in Sharp Decline. A recent World Bank study on municipal&#13;
finances in West Bank and Gaza2basedon a survey of 52 municipalities shows a declining trend&#13;
in local government revenues over the past six years. A major factor contributingto this decline&#13;
is the inability of many householdsto pay for electricity and water services, as a major source of&#13;
revenue decline appears to be due to declining revenues for utility services. This phenomenonis&#13;
illustratedinthe following chart.&#13;

Steady Decline in Local Government Expenditures. In parallel with declines in revenue, local&#13;
government expenditures for services&#13;
and      local    administration     have&#13;
deteriorated significantly relativeto total             WBG LocallGeneral Government Expenditures (Sample)&#13;

in the mid-l990s, local governments assumed a majority of the responsibilities for service&#13;
provision. A further deterioration in the financial and functional capacity of Palestinian local&#13;
governments could leadto increasingdependency on centralgovernment for assistance, reversing&#13;
a historical Palestiniananomaly in the Middle East where local governments have traditionally&#13;
shoulderedmost ofthe responsibilityfor localservice provision&#13;
&#13;
Distressed Municipalities and Mounting Financial Arrears.              Mounting municipal arrears&#13;
represent a key challenge in the sector and point to the high risk exposure of LGs in times of&#13;
financial crisis when citizens are unable to pay for electricity, water and other services delivered&#13;
by LGs. Municipal financial arrears alone are estimated to have reached approximatelyNIS450&#13;
million at the close of 2004 and continueto expand each month, as many households simply lack&#13;
the ability to pay. One important caveat is that more than 70 percent of these arrears are&#13;
concentrated at the ten largest municipalities, suggesting that a well-targeted strategy, including&#13;
work out plans for each of the distressed municipalities, could be achievable in the short- to&#13;
medium-term, if coupled with a longer-termstrategy of establishinga hard budget constraintthat&#13;
is enforced at the central level, while considering reassignment of some revenue collection&#13;
responsibilitiesto the local level.&#13;
&#13;
Emergency Assessments. As noted in the forgoing, the nature of the emergency situation that&#13;
prevails in WBG today is complex in that it is the result of a range of different factors, including&#13;
the impact of direct conflict in damaging human and physicalassets, facilities and infrastructure;&#13;
a severe and prolonged economic downturn (accompanied by high rates of unemployment and&#13;
very limited levels of new private investment) with few immediate prospects for recovery;&#13;
political stalemate in putting the peace process back on track; and an unravelingof some of the&#13;
critical donor assistanceand support structures, and, consequently, aid flows. Such circumstances&#13;
might best be characterized as a "slow onset disaster." A number of different assessments have&#13;
been carried out which attempt to quantify and in other ways characterize the nature of the&#13;
emergency. Most recently (September 2006), the Municipal Development and Lending Fund&#13;
(MDLF) carried out a survey of over 100 municipalities. The survey revealed that, on balance,&#13;
municipal revenues were approximately36 percent below their already contracted level from the&#13;
previous year, thus highlightingthe fiscal dimensionof the emergency at the local level. Nablus&#13;
Municipality, for example, reports that it is only able to collect 18 percent of the electricity&#13;
service fees it charges to its customers. This is generally attributable to the high and prolonged&#13;
level of unemployment that has prevailedover the past year where in most cases citizens do not&#13;
have the ability to meet their service cost obligations. This has resulted in the contraction of&#13;
many essential municipalservicesthat will requirebudgetary support to be sustained.&#13;
&#13;
Municipality Identiped Assistance Needs. The MDLF survey highlights a number of essential&#13;
municipal services for which support is being requested, namely rehabilitation of internal&#13;
municipalroads damaged due to conflict or worn due to deferred maintenance; private contractor&#13;
expenses for removingdebris from damaged buildings, for solid waste collection and for landfill&#13;
tipping fees; fuel to operate water pumps, electrical generators, and for service vehicles,&#13;
particularly for solid waste collection, to increase collection visits; electricity for street lighting&#13;
and bulbs, poles and lamps to repair existing lights. Many water wells and wastewater pumping&#13;
stations are reported to be operating at sub-optimal levels because of a lack of spare parts.&#13;
Electricity shortages have ledto an overuse of standby diesel generators at water and wastewater&#13;
stations, increasing the operating costs to municipalitiesand often causing damage to sensitive&#13;
equipment due to frequent power surges and cuts.            Moreover, the depreciation of roads&#13;
throughout WBG is accelerating, as they are no longer being properly cleaned and maintained&#13;
because of municipal revenue shortfalls and the need to focus expenditures on only the most&#13;
essential services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Municipality Coping Strategies. Municipalities, many of which actually pre-date the Palestinian&#13;
Authority, have endured and provento be quite resilient during prolongedperiods of conflict and&#13;
economic depression, while trying to address essential municipal service needs. Particularly over&#13;
the past several years where their revenues have generally been declining, they have had to resort&#13;
to a range of different coping strategies. These have included efforts to enhance local revenue&#13;
collection for services by including solid waste removal fees on electricity and water bills;&#13;
offering discounts and other incentive schemes to promote cost recovery, including graduated&#13;
payments; conductingpublic awareness campaigns and addressing their constituents in mosques&#13;
and other public venues to stress the need for payment for services; expanding operatinghours to&#13;
make access to the municipality easier for payingcustomers; suspending plannedrecruitmentand&#13;
removingovertime incentivesor eliminatingannual salary increases; and payingcommissions to&#13;
debt collectors. Other harsher means have also been taken, including denial of service to some&#13;
households and off-setting PA salaries to settle overdue accounts. Some improvements in local&#13;
revenue collection have been noted in 2006 following local government elections and based on&#13;
the increased legitimacy of local councils following a hiatus of 30 years in which local elections&#13;
had been suspended.&#13;
&#13;
Counterpart Strategv &amp; Response Going Forward             In assessing the situation, Palestinian&#13;
counterparts at the Ministry of Planning (MOP) and Ministry of Local Government (MOLG)&#13;
have expressed a keen desire to maintain the longer-term institution-building agenda that the&#13;
Bank has assumed since its initial engagement in WBG, namely to assist in building the elements&#13;
of a nation state. However, as reflected in their letter to Bank management dated October15,&#13;
2006 (See Annex 9,they also recognize the needfor immediate and urgentemergency assistance&#13;
and, on that basis, have requestedthe Bank to convert the proposed Municipal Management and&#13;
Service Delivery Project (MMSDP), which was under preparation and planned for delivery in&#13;
FY06, into an emergency operation. This request is consistent with the Bank's assistance strategy&#13;
as set out in the WBG strategy document submitted to the Board in December 2, 2003, which&#13;
seeks to "maintain a balance between medium-term development activity where feasible while&#13;
providing emergency assistance designed to sustain Palestinian institutions and mitigate&#13;
poverty.yy3&#13;
&#13;
Porifolio Review &amp; Bank Emergency Response Strategy, Prior to the Palestinian Authority&#13;
(PA) request to do so, the Bank carriedout its own assessmentof the WBG portfolio inJune 2006&#13;
and considered options to respond to the evolving emergency situation. At present, the WBG&#13;
portfolio consists of 10 active projects, with a total commitment amount of $107.8 million, of&#13;
which $43.6 million is undisbursed to date. Around 60 percent of net commitments are in the&#13;
infrastructure sector (water and sanitation, electricity and solid waste), with remaining funds&#13;
mainly targeting education and social services. The WBG disbursement ratio has since FY03&#13;
been the highest in MNA and well above the overall Bank average, with FY07 disbursements&#13;
keepingpace, as $7.9 million has been disbursed as of October 2006. As many of the existing&#13;
operations in the portfolio were designed to address emergency conditions, or to take such&#13;
conditions into account, no resources were identified for reallocation within the portfolio as a&#13;
potential response to the acute nature of the present emergency. As such, any new emergency&#13;
initiatives would need to draw down from the remainingfunds available in the Trust Fund for&#13;
West Bank and Gaza. On this basis, authorization was provided to proceed in preparing the&#13;
Second Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project (EMSRP II)with financing in the&#13;
amount of US$lOmillion. As with previous Bank-financed operations, the aim was to design&#13;

EMSRP I1 to leverage the Bank's resources to the greatest extent possible through active aid&#13;
mobilization and coordination efforts. As further detailedbelow, donor co-financiers have been&#13;
key partners in discussingand contributingto the design and financingof the proposedoperation.&#13;
&#13;
SECTION B. BANK RESPONSE &amp; STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
In the absence of a conventional Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the Executive Directors&#13;
approved on December 2, 2003 a document that outlines the Status of the Bank's Program in&#13;
WBG &amp; Strategy GoingForward. This document outlinesthe Bank's proposed strategy in WBG&#13;
for 2004 and beyond (until such time as a new strategy is adopted) and, in particularemphasizes&#13;
the Bank's focus on "maintaining medium-term development activity where feasible and&#13;
providingemergency assistancedesigned to sustain Palestinianinstitutionsand mitigatepoverty".&#13;
EMSRP Iwas one component of that strategy and was acknowledged to be an important&#13;
instrument, not only in addressing local-level emergency needs, but also in helping the PA to&#13;
establish a rational, transparent and predictable intergovernmentaltransfer system.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale for the Bank's Involvement. The Bank has considerable global and WBG-specific&#13;
experience in designing and implementing emergency operations in response to emergencies&#13;
arisingdue to conflict or naturaldisasters. InWBG in particular, the Bank is often relied uponto&#13;
lead such efforts.     The first three operations implemented by the Bank in WBG4were all&#13;
emergency in nature and benefited from simplicity in design, while contributing toward the&#13;
establishment of Palestinian implementation capacity in the absence of such capacity at the&#13;
outset. Moreover, the Bank has demonstrated an ability to respond rapidly to emergency needs&#13;
through its US$12 million contribution to the Emergency Response Program', launched in&#13;
December 2000 - only two months after the start of the Intifada -- in which the Bank and five&#13;
other donors providedover US$37 million to create temporary employment opportunitiesthrough&#13;
small-scale infrastructure microprojects. Furthermore, the Bank's ability to mobilize resources&#13;
and to contribute by providing a framework for other donor assistance is illustrated by the&#13;
Emergency Services Support Project, which has mobilizedsubstantial donor cofinancingover the&#13;
years. Similarly, EMSRP I was able to mobilize cofinancing from the European Union (30&#13;
million Euro), the Italian Government (25 million Euro) and the Government of Denmark (56.5&#13;
millionDanishKroner).&#13;
&#13;
Donor Aid Mobilization &amp; Coordination in the Municipal Sector. The proposed EMSRP I1has&#13;
been prepared in close coordination with other donor cofinanciers active in the sector and has&#13;
generated firm commitments of Euro 5 million from the Government of the Netherlands and Euro&#13;
12 million from Agence FranGaise de Developpement.              Further commitments from the&#13;
Government of Sweden and KFW are likely to be confirmed later in the calendar year and could&#13;
contribute an additional EURO 15-20 million to the sector, as these donors prepare their 2007&#13;
assistance programs. The Bank i s also seen as a key partner with other donors in the sector as it&#13;
serves as the Technical Secretariat to the Local Government Sector Working Group. From an&#13;
implementation perspective, the Bank's Country Office is staffed with highly skilled and&#13;
experienced national and internationalstaff- both in West Bank and Gaza - which enables it to&#13;
more effectively administerand supervise emergency programsthan many of the smaller bilateral&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Emergency RehabilitationProjectIand I1(November 1994 andMay 1996respectively) and the&#13;
EducationandHealthRehabilitationProject (February 1998).&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
donors. This is the principal reason - in addition to the leveragingeffect -- that many bilateral&#13;
donors have sought the Bank's assistance in administeringtheir cofinancingor in helpingdesign&#13;
programsand projects.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons Learned from Previous Similar Operations. A major lesson learned from recent&#13;
emergency operations supported by the Bank is that developing countries are becoming&#13;
increasingly aware of the need to put in place measuresto prevent or reduce risks arising due to&#13;
crises. The past ten years have seen an increase in the number of Bank-supportedemergency&#13;
recovery projects, and also a steep learning curve in the Bank's own understanding of how to&#13;
operationalizesustainable interventions.&#13;
&#13;
With respect to Bank experience in WBG, complementary approaches adopted by ESSP (in&#13;
providing support to sustain centrally-providededucation, health and social services) andEMSRP&#13;
(supporting localities in providingmunicipalservices) have demonstrated that the Bank and other&#13;
donors need to focus on both central and local levels.           Over centralization of service&#13;
administration and delivery can result in implementation delays, and mobility restrictions in&#13;
WBG in particular have shown that greater decentralizationin the assignment of responsibilities&#13;
i s essential for effectiveness and to achieve impact. Based on the findings of a recent review of&#13;
EMSRP I,it was further noted that the project scope was too broad, aiming to address over 400&#13;
localities,thus spreading too thinly limited resources while limiting the Project's impact. These&#13;
lessons learnedhave been incorporatedinto the proposedproject's design, as EMSRP I1would be&#13;
targetingonly the 131 municipal areas, while other Bank interventions(particularlythe Integrated&#13;
Community Development Project) would aim to target refugee camps and smaller village&#13;
councils and communities.&#13;
&#13;
Building further on learning gained from EMSRP I,implementation of the proposed project&#13;
would be managed on a day-to-daybasisby afully staffed entity inthe newly-establishedMDLF,&#13;
which attributes its establishment to the support, provided under EMSRP I.To ensure project&#13;
flexibility and responsiveness to different community needs and to circumvent prevailing&#13;
mobility restrictions, the design of EMSRP I1 retains the demand-driven arrangement and&#13;
decentralized implementation approach of its predecessor, whereby local governments, in&#13;
consultation with their communities (to the extent possible), would determine their own&#13;
emergency assistance priorities and would implement projects at the local level, including&#13;
preparation of emergency programs, tendering, contracting and supervising implementation,&#13;
under the guidance of the MDLF. This approach would be reinforcedby the engagement of four&#13;
regionally-basedteams of technical consultants who would provide monitoring, implementation&#13;
support and training to participating municipalities. Streamlined Bank procurement procedures&#13;
would be used to facilitate implementationand experience and capacity gained by MDLF from&#13;
implementingEMSRP Iand other donor funds would facilitate implementation and the flow of&#13;
funds.&#13;
&#13;
Another key lesson learned from past experience is the need for effective donor coordination,&#13;
both before and during project implementation. In the preparationof EMSRP 11,every donor&#13;
providing assistance to the local government sector was consulted to inform the Project's design.&#13;
Agreement was reached to design the approach and allocation mechanism with maximum&#13;
flexibility to take into account other donors' financing requirements as well their respective&#13;
comparative advantages. Coordinationwith GTZ in designinga broad-basedtechnical assistance&#13;
strategy for WBG local governments is under preparationwith the aim of rationalizing donor&#13;
interventions in the sector. It was further agreed with the PA, MDLF and donor partners that a&#13;
Donor Coordination Forum (DCF) would be established for EMSRP I1 to ensure effective&#13;
communications, reporting and monitoring. The DCF would include donors and key Palestinian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
counterpart agencies. It would meet regularly on a quarterly basis and would review reports&#13;
issued by the MDLF. Annex 6 includes a chart that sets out the project implementation&#13;
arrangements and the specific role of the DCF within it. It is expected that the DCF membership&#13;
would expand as other donors consider channeling contributions through the MDLF once&#13;
commitments can be made in subsequentdonor aid commitmentcycles.&#13;
&#13;
Considerable learning has also taken place through a Bank review of donor-financedemergency&#13;
employment creationprograms in WBG; this exercise was financed by the Bank and carried out&#13;
in coordination with all donors providing emergency employment assistance through the Sector&#13;
Working Group on Employment Generation. Many such programs have relied on conventional&#13;
works-based, largely capital intensive project designs to create temporary employment&#13;
opportunities and placed much of the burden on contractors to find ways of ensuring maximum&#13;
labor content. However, because these sub-projects by design are not labor intensive, many of&#13;
the subprojects featured labor content of no more than 20 percent, thus limiting impact. In&#13;
response, the PA, the Bank and other donors have agreed to adopt a labor-intensive approach in&#13;
the designand implementationof these sub-projects inthe future. Informedby L O andtechnical&#13;
consultant recommendations in the referenced review report, an employment generation&#13;
component of the proposed Project would be designed to support subprojects implemented by&#13;
local governments with a minimum labor content of 50%6. Technical assistance in project&#13;
identification, selection, preparation and implementation would be supported through training&#13;
workshops and capacity building by regionally-basedlocal technical consultants, with support&#13;
from internationalexperts.&#13;
&#13;
Building on EMSRP's legacy of achievement. In addition to addressing emergency needs,&#13;
EMSRP also introducedmeasures to (i) strengthen donor coordinationin the sector, (ii) promote&#13;
greater accountability and public disclosure, as well as local participation, and (iii)establish an&#13;
institutionalizedmechanism for central-localresourcetransfers. First, EMSRP has introducedthe&#13;
concept of LG upward and downward financial accountability by requiring public participation&#13;
and disclosure of the Emergency Assistance Program (EAP) budgets submittedto the MOLG in&#13;
order for LGs to be eligible to receive assistance. Second, this eligibility requirement was&#13;
coupled with a requirement for LGs to submit their annual executed and planned budgets, which&#13;
has resulted in a significant increase inthe number of submissions from 25 in Gaza alone prior to&#13;
EMSRPto 285 in 2004 in all of WB&amp;G -- over a ten-fold increase. While it was not possible to&#13;
consider more stringent performance requirements under EMSRP II due to emergency&#13;
circumstances beyond the control of municipalities, the aim is to build upon the awareness of&#13;
accountability as a practice established over the past two years by institutionalizing a more&#13;
predictableand rules-basedsystem.&#13;
&#13;
Donor Partnerships and Cofmancing are the Hallmark of EMSRP. Past experience with&#13;
EMSRP Iin coordinatingdonor interventionshas yielded a solid framework and institutionalized&#13;
approach for donor coordination going forward. While the EU, Bank, Italian and other projects&#13;
were initiated in the sector with different project steering committees, separate project&#13;
implementation units, and very limited exchange and sharing of information, consolidation was&#13;
achieved in the form of a joint project implementation unit (which has since evolved into the&#13;
MDLF), a joint steering committee (which is now the MDLF Board) and a joint quarterly&#13;
progress report, which will continueto be maintainedas the reportingformat by MDLF under the&#13;
proposedoperation.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Sustaining the Capacity Building Agenda.          Despite the challenges of the implementation&#13;
environment, the Bank continues to administer a Danish Trust Fund that finances the Local&#13;
Government Capacity Building Project (LGCBP) (2004-8), supported by a grant of DKK56.5&#13;
million, approximately $10 million equivalent from the Government of Denmark. This project&#13;
focuses on developing a systems approach to the design and implementation of a Municipal&#13;
Financial Management Information System (MFMIS) first at selected pilot municipalities and&#13;
gradually rolling out the system to others once it is operationally tested. LGCBP also supports&#13;
the development of urban planning capacity at the local level and guidelines for urban planning&#13;
and zoning. The specific objectives of the project are to: (i)improve the accounting, financial&#13;
management and budgetary preparation and control capabilities of municipalities; (ii)sstrengthen&#13;
the capacity of municipalities to effectively guide, manage and monitor the development of the&#13;
urban areas and be responsive to the needs of citizens; and (iii) increase the capacity of MOLGto&#13;
oversee and support a decentralised local government system. This set of objectives evolvedout&#13;
of a detailed diagnostic study of the sector and Reform Action Plan prepared by MOLG in 2004&#13;
with support from the Government of Japan andUNDP&#13;
&#13;
SECTIONC. DETAILEDPROJECTDESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
Project Objectives and Development Outcomes. EMSRP I1 is designed primarily as a repeater&#13;
project to EMSRP Iand would address many of the same areas of support. Palestinian&#13;
counterparts indicate that these remain critical areas of need, including assistance to sustain&#13;
essential municipal services, promote temporary employment generation, while maintaining a&#13;
medium-termdevelopment agenda. The Projecthas beenprepared in accordancewith the Bank's&#13;
guidelines for emergency recovery operations (OP/BP 8.5), which are intended to be simple in&#13;
design, fast disbursingand responsiveto emergency needs aimed at restoringhehabilitatingassets&#13;
and services. The main objectives of EMSRP I1are to: (i)help mitigate further deterioration in&#13;
the delivery of essential municipal services, including solid waste collection, street lighting,&#13;
provision of water, wastewater and electricity services (where such services are provided by&#13;
municipalities), and street cleaning, among other services, through rehabilitation of damaged or&#13;
deteriorating infrastructure and the provision of non-wage budgetary support for direct service&#13;
cost inputs; (ii)create temporary job opportunities at the local level through the launching of&#13;
labor-intensive employment generation schemes, proportionally allocated on the basis of an&#13;
unemployment index; and (iii)pilot innovative initiatives that foster Local Government-NGO&#13;
collaborationin response to urgent community needs and assist municipalitiesin recoveringcosts&#13;
for the provisionof services.&#13;
Project Components and Estimated Costs. The total cost of the proposed Project is currently&#13;
estimated to be about US$40.2 million, out of which US$lO million is proposedto be financed by&#13;
the World Bank through the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank (TFGWB), and further&#13;
commitments of EURO 5 million from the Government of the Netherlands and EURO 12 million&#13;
by Agence Franpaise de Developpement. Other donor funding commitments are pending with&#13;
likely contributions from the Government of Sweden and KFW expected to be in the range of&#13;
EURO 10-15 million combined. A two year Emergency Recovery Grant would include the&#13;
following components: (a) Emergency Municipal Service Assistance Grants; (b) Labor-Intensive&#13;
Emergency Employment Generation; (c) MDF InnovationWindow; and (d) ProjectManagement&#13;
Costs, as further detailed below.&#13;
Comuonent I: Emeraencv Municipal Services Assistance Grants. (Total component cost:&#13;
US$29.7 million, Bank financing US$7.0 million; Government of Netherlands, US$3 million&#13;
equivalent; AFD US$13 million equivalent; FinancingGap of US$6.7 million). This component&#13;
would finance (i) rehabilitation, reconstruction and upgrading of damaged municipal&#13;
infrastructure and facilities, as well as the supply of equipment to sustain municipal service&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
provision, and (ii)non-wage recurrent expenditures as direct inputs to the provision of essential&#13;
municipal services over a period of up to two years. Allocations would be awarded upon&#13;
approval of an Emergency Assistance Application, which would be prepared by municipal&#13;
councils in consultation with their communities to the extent possible and evaluated and&#13;
appraised by MDLF. An indicative list of priority areas requiring support based on an MDLF&#13;
survey carriedout in August 2006 is providedbelow.&#13;
&#13;
    o Water and wastewater services. Maintenance and rehabilitation of existing municipal&#13;
         water and sewerage networks, wells and reservoirs; provision of chemicals for water&#13;
         purification; repair and maintenance of equipment, such as pumps, generators, vacuum&#13;
         tanks, and vehicles; purchase of spare parts, goods, vehicles and fuel; payment of water&#13;
         andwastewater bills, and equipment;&#13;
    o Solid waste services. Service contracts for solid waste collection, as well as labor,&#13;
         dumping fees, solid waste containers, tools, trucks and compactors, spare parts for solid&#13;
         waste trucks, fuel, vehicle lubricants, insurance, equipment, materials, and other related&#13;
         direct runningcosts for municipal services;&#13;
    o Road rehabilitation and maintenance services. Goods and works for maintenance,&#13;
         rehabilitation and reconstructionof existing internal roads, including traffic signs, road&#13;
         line demarcations, safety rails, traffic signals, street lighting, sidewalks, fuel, vehicle&#13;
         insurance androad maintenancetools and equipment;&#13;
    o Electricity services.        Supply and replacement of transformers and electrical panels,&#13;
         electrical cables and poles, accessories, spare parts, maintenance tools and equipment,&#13;
         vehicle insurance, fuel, vehicle lubricants and electricity bills as a direct input to service&#13;
         provisioncosts.&#13;
&#13;
This financial support would take the form of an annual transfer from the MDLF in two cycles&#13;
over two fiscal years -- 2007 and 2008 (January-December), These allocations would be linked&#13;
to the annual budget preparationand reportingcycle. Access to EMSRP I1financing would be&#13;
conditional on submission of a prior year executed budget report, a budget plan for the current&#13;
fiscal year, and a statement of year-end financial accounts conforming to the revised municipal&#13;
Chart of Accounts adopted for FY2007'. Formats for these submissions have been completed in&#13;
draft form and would be revised and ready for distribution to municipalities by the proposed&#13;
Project launch date (January 2007). This measure is intended to improve municipal budgeting&#13;
and financial reporting, in addition to providing critical municipal data to populate the municipal&#13;
financial database, which would be used in turn to strengthen sector monitoringduringthe course&#13;
of the project and beyond.&#13;
&#13;
An allocationtable based on a per capita distributionhas been preparedby MDLF and is included&#13;
in the Project Operations Manual. The total resource pool for distribution over the two year&#13;
timeframe is US$ 23 million', with an average distribution of US$11.5 million per annual&#13;
budgetary cycle. This would represent approximately 6 percent of the estimated average annual&#13;
expenditures of the municipal sector (using the prior three year average in constant US$). All&#13;
131 municipal areas would be eligible to participate, representing coverage of just below 70&#13;
&#13;
'Therationale  for includingthis condition is the demonstrated effectiveness ofthis provision under&#13;
EMSRPIwhere executedandplannedbudget submissions to MOLGrose dramatically from 25 percent&#13;
reportingprior to the project to over 85 percent reportingduringthe project,basedon the incentiveto&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                                     10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  percent of the WBG population. Local governments that are not classifiedas municipalities, i.e.&#13;
, village councils, local project councils and village committees, would be providedwith support&#13;
  through other donor-financedmechanisms9. Once a municipality has been determined eligible&#13;
  for assistance, its proposed Emergency Assistance Programs (EAPs) would be prepared. EAPs&#13;
  would consist of one or more subprojects, each of which would be reviewed using screening&#13;
  criteria that includes a "positive list" of eligible subprojects and proposed impacts in a particular&#13;
  service area. Subprojects would also be reviewed to determine their technical soundness and&#13;
  potential economic benefit. Municipalities would be assisted in preparing their EAPs by four&#13;
  regionally based Local Technical Consultantsto facilitate processingand enhance capacity at the&#13;
  local level. To the extent possible, EAPs would be prepared in consultation with their&#13;
  communities. Standard forms, updated from EMSRP Iand included in the Project Operations&#13;
  Manual, would be usedto prepare municipalEAPs.&#13;
&#13;
  The EAP Application Form is structured into two parts relatingto support for municipal service&#13;
  provisionto distinguish between two financing sub-categories: (a) infrastructurerehabilitation/&#13;
  upgradingand service delivery equipment; and (b) non-wage budgetary support for direct service&#13;
  inputs (primarily fuel, spare parts, and electricity bills for street lighting and other municipal&#13;
  services). The procurement procedures for the different subcomponent activities are further&#13;
  detailedinthe procurement section ofthis document.&#13;
&#13;
  Disbursements by MDLF from each earmarked municipal budget allocation would be made to&#13;
  municipalities against an approved EAP and on the basis of original paid vendor/contractor&#13;
  receipts, original vendor/contractor invoices, or by direct payment to the vendor/contractor,&#13;
  depending on the circumstances. Disbursement and financial management arrangements are&#13;
  presented ina later section ofthis report.&#13;
&#13;
  Component 2: Labor-intensive Emulovment Generation. (Total Component Cost: US$ 6.10&#13;
  million: of which Government of the Netherlands US$3.0 million equivalent,and Bank financing&#13;
  US$l.10 million; FinancingGap of US$2.0 million). This sub-component would finance labor-&#13;
  intensive temporary employment sub-projects that are identified and implemented by&#13;
  Municipalitiesin coordinationwith locally-basedcommunity groups. Past experience has shown&#13;
  that pre-designed schemes often lack ownership and acceptance at the community level, making&#13;
  community engagement vital to success. Funds would be earmarked for municipalities on the&#13;
  basis of the unemployment index of the Governorate in which they are located". This allocation&#13;
  method would ensure that localities in greatest need of assistance would be eligible to receive a&#13;
  greater share of resources. Distribution of grant proceeds would be linked to the annual budget&#13;
  preparation cycle and are expected to be implemented in two project cycles over a period of 18-&#13;
  24 months. The total commitment to this Component is US$4.1 million (as of October 2006),&#13;
  yielding a distribution of US$2.05 million per annual cycle. Component financing is likely to&#13;
  increase, however, based on indications from potential donor cofinanciers, but these&#13;
  commitments are not likely to materializeuntil 2007.&#13;
&#13;
  As with the municipalservices allocations,to be eligible for financing made available under this&#13;
  Component, municipalities would be required to complete a corresponding section of the&#13;
  Emergency Assistance Program application form, which has been prepared by the MDLF. To&#13;
  become eligible, project designs would need to ensure a minimum of 50% labor content or&#13;
  demonstrate indirect benefits to offset any shortfall. Sub-projects in a variety of sectors,&#13;
  including agriculture, NGO-based services, etc., would be eligible for financing, provided they&#13;
&#13;
  9One such instrumentwould bethe Bank-financedIntegratedCommunityDevelopment Project.&#13;
  loDisaggregateddata at the municipal level is unavailable.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
meet the labor intensive criteria. Assistance to municipalities in preparing their sub-projects&#13;
would be providedby MDLF staff and regionally-basedLocal TechnicalConsultants (LTCs) for&#13;
extensionservices (including preparationof simplified standard bidding documents, training and&#13;
public awareness regarding labor-intensive project design and implementation) as may be&#13;
requested by the municipality. The municipality may also choose to seek assistance from NGOs&#13;
or specialized consultants. Financing for this technical support to the MDLF and to the LTCs&#13;
would be provided under Component 4 of the proposed Project. The MDLF would also be&#13;
responsiblefor coordinatingdonor-financedresponsesto employmentcreationneeds.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: MDLF Innovation Window (Total component cost: US$1.20 million, Bank&#13;
financingUS$1.20 million.) This component is divided into two sub-components:&#13;
&#13;
    Piloting pre-paid metering svstems at municipalities. (Total sub-component cost: US$0.50&#13;
    million, Bank financing US$O.SO million). This subcomponent would be implementedat no&#13;
    more than 3 pilot municipalitiesand tested as a means of enabling municipalitiesto enhance&#13;
    local revenuecollection.&#13;
&#13;
    (a)  The Subcomponent design is based on prior successful piloting of the approach at&#13;
    Jerusalem District Electric Utility Company. The subcomponent would finance purchase of&#13;
    over 3,500 new meters, administrativesystems and technical assistance to guide the piloting&#13;
    process. Designand implementationof the scheme would be carriedout by a contractorwho&#13;
    would work with municipalitiesin designing the approach and guiding the process. Regular&#13;
    reportingto MDLF on implementationprogress, obstacles and methods proposedinresolving&#13;
    them will enable the pilot to be successfully implemented through effective and timely&#13;
    monitoring and feedback if corrective measures are needed. Successful implementationof&#13;
    the pilot could enable follow on assistance from other donors.&#13;
&#13;
    (b) Piloting Local Government-NGO collaboration for emergency and other ioint&#13;
   programming purposes. (Total sub-component cost: US$ 0.70 million, Bank financing&#13;
    US$0.70 million.) This pilot activity is being prepared in coordinationwith a parallelBank-&#13;
    financed operation (NGO Project 111). The main aim of this pilot is to encourage greater&#13;
   coordination and joint programming by local governments and NGOs at the local level&#13;
   through the requirement of a joint funding proposal. NGOs would be financed under the&#13;
   NGO 111Project, while municipalitieswould be financed under EMRSP11. EMSRP I1would&#13;
    likely finance physical rehabilitation and/or expansion of public facilities, parks and other&#13;

   for youth, children, and women. Public awareness campaigns to promote water and energy&#13;
   conservation, public health, and environmentalmanagement are proposals likely to receive&#13;
   support. The LGU component would involve financingfor small-scale civil works and goods&#13;
   not to exceed an aggregate value of US$70,000 per subproject and would likely include&#13;
   playgroundand park rehabilitation, fencing, sports facilities (soccerhasketball)and amenities&#13;
   to providea platform for NGOsto organize community activitiesfor youth, children, women,&#13;
   etc.   Sub-projects would not involve any greenfield type investments. Moreover, such&#13;
   rehabilitationworks are likely to have a positive impact on the environment, including repair&#13;
   to facilities, municipalwatedwastewater connections and improvedmanagement of facilities.&#13;
   In addition, municipalitieswill be actively encouragingNGOs to organize and prepare public&#13;
   awareness campaigns to promote water conservation, environmental health, clean-up&#13;

IBox: Pre-paid Metering Schemes: A Means of Addressingthe Problem of Arrears?&#13;
&#13;
 Pre-paid metering (PPM) systems have been tested and are now operating in more than 40 countries around&#13;
 the world Such systems are being used most extensively in the United Kingdom and South Africa where 3&#13;
 million and 2 million users respectively are covered by this new approach to utility billing. Other countries&#13;
 are mainly in the piloting phases and have somewhere between 100 and 100,000 meters in place. PPM&#13;
 systems are now mature (we know their advantages and disadvantagesthrough multiple testing experiences)&#13;
 and PPM markets are growing internationally. PPM systems have been applied to electricity, water, gas,&#13;
 telephoneand cell phone services. Locally, the JerusalemElectricity Company (JEC) was the first to introduce&#13;
 the new technology on a pilot basisand has done so successfully.&#13;
&#13;
 Why introducepre-paid metering? Pre-paid metering systems have been introducedfor a variety of reasons.&#13;
 The main reason has been to improve revenue recovery, but many sources today cite the opportunity to&#13;
 improvecustomer service as another key reason. Elimination of meter readings, as well as billing and mailing&#13;
 can have a significant impact in driving down administrative costs, which pre-paid metering systems have&#13;
 allowedproviders to do. But there are other factors that figure into the pricing of utilities that provide inherent&#13;
 subsidies to some users, while raising the costs for all users. Removingsuch costs or subsidies would allow&#13;
 providersto pass on savings to the general user. For instance, with PPM systems there is no need for credit&#13;
 control, for provisioning for bad debt or arrears or for legal and technical services for&#13;
 disconnectionheconnectionprocesses, all of which are costs that are built into cost recovery charges and tariff&#13;
 rates. Pre-paid metering can also represent a significant cost savings to the extent that it can eliminate the&#13;
 need for postal system services or delivery of bills door-to-door.&#13;
&#13;
 Improved energy and water conservation.            From an energy conservation and household expenditure&#13;
 management perspective, PPM systems tend to encourage users to better manage consumption, a significant&#13;
 positivespillover effect, particularlyin aresourcescarce regionsuch as the Middle East. Customers are much&#13;
 more in control of their usage and can save money while better monitoringand understandinghow to manage&#13;
 their household consumption. Initially, PPMsystems oftentranslate into revenuedeclines for providersdue to&#13;
 lower average consumption, but system losses are reduced significantly in parallel and capacity can be&#13;
 extendedto achieve greater systemcoverage.&#13;
&#13;
 Reduction of bad debts and arrears. Providers have noted experiencing dramatic declines in bad debts and&#13;
 arrears where they have introduced PPM systems. They also note improved cash flow, due to receiving&#13;
 money up front and, hence, improvedrelationswith customers. Customers appear to prefer the flexibility and&#13;
 open system approach o f a PPM system, which allows them to purchase electricity at any time and in any&#13;
 quantity, and to avoidthe end-of-themonthbudget crunch. Moreover, no deposits are required.&#13;
&#13;
 Improved means of targeting thepoor through the elimination of costs and subsidies built into the existing&#13;
 system. Through the use o f a range of new payment options and smart technologies, PPM can aid central or&#13;
 local governments in providing targeted subsidies (in-kind support for electricity service to the poorest.&#13;
 Magnetic cards, smart cards, memory cards, keypad tokens and smart tokens are all ways of converting&#13;
 payments into service.&#13;
&#13;
 As with all new technologies, the question is how to implement such a system from a technical,&#13;
 organizational, managerial and cultural perspective? First, a pilot design and implementation strategy&#13;
 would be prepared, initially for a pilot project involving no more than three municipalities. Drawing on&#13;
 lessons learned from the Jerusalem District Electric Utility Company, the strategy would take into account&#13;
 most appropriate technologies, customer preferences, technical specifications, public awareness requirements,&#13;
 etc. Policy issues will arise as well, such as whether PPM will be a free choice or forced use system. More&#13;
 successful PPM pilots have been built around an extensive and dedicated external and internal marketing&#13;
 campaign to raise awareness (internal staff, political players, media, community organizations and their&#13;
 representatives, customers), but there is also an extensive need for training; restructuring of management&#13;
 processes, and installationof new meters, all of which is providedfor inthe proposedpilot activity budget.&#13;

A "call for joint LG-NGO proposals" would be issued three months after the effectiveness of&#13;
PNGOIII and EMSRP I1and a total of 10 projects would be selected to be implementedover a&#13;
two-year period by NDC and the Municipal Development Lending Fund (MDLF). In order to&#13;
ensure that the two organizations are well coordinated in implementing the two projects, the&#13;
Operation Manuals for both projects include the same application form and provide the same&#13;
implementation steps. NDC and MDLF, would launch an information and communication&#13;
campaign through joint brochures, advertisements in the media and outreach, targeting both&#13;
municipalities and NGOs in the 4 governorates. This campaign would inform the public on&#13;
procedures for grant application, eligibility criteria, and time frame. There would also be one&#13;
locationfor applicationsubmission, with the time and date stamped, and a receiptprovidedto the&#13;
applicant.&#13;
&#13;
Each organization, NDC and MDLF, will independently conduct a preliminary technical&#13;
screening of the applications focusing on their respective sectoral sections. Subsequently, ajoint&#13;
NDC/MDLF Technical Review Committee (TRC) will review the proposals based on the&#13;
relevance of the proposed projectsfor improvingcooperation between municipalities and NGOs,&#13;
readiness for implementingthe activity and adequate timeframe etc. The proposal will have to be&#13;
endorsed by the NDC and MDLF Boards. During implementation, joint supervision visits&#13;
between the MDLF and NDC will be carried out andjoint progress reports will be submitted. A&#13;
senior level Management Steering Committee comprisingthe Directors of both organizations as&#13;
well as their respective Program Officers, will oversee implementation and address any&#13;
bottlenecks that might arise.                A diagram illustrating the process flow and institutional&#13;
arrangements is presentedbelow.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
         (a) MDLF ManagementFee. (Sub-component costs to administer donor funds, basedon&#13;
             a 5 percent administration fee). MDLF prepared a fully costed out budget for the&#13;
             implementation of EMSRP 11. Taking into account its fixed and variable costs,&#13;
             including staff, equipment and operating costs, MDLF's projected budget would be&#13;
             approximately 5 percent of total project financing. This administrative fee was&#13;
             reviewedand assessedto be reasonable.&#13;
&#13;
         (b) Technical assistance and monitoring. (US$1.3 million). In addition to MDLF's&#13;
             Management Fee, additional costs will be incurred to ensure effective project&#13;
             implementation, including financing of the four regionally-based Local Technical&#13;
             Consultants (LTCs) to support municipalities in preparing and implementing their&#13;
             Emergency Assistance Programs; a technical review audit; environmentaland social&#13;
             safeguard reviews; training in procurement and financial management; a beneficiary&#13;
             impact assessment; and other small, specialized technical assistance assignments.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental Aspects. The proposed Project would likely include investments related to&#13;
rehabilitation, maintenance and upgrading of internal and access roads, water and sanitation&#13;
services, and storm water drainage networks, maintenance of schools, health centers and&#13;
community centers, as well as other municipalassets. Moreover, it would finance the purchase of&#13;
small quantities of chlorine for purifying water supply and pesticides for pest control in water&#13;
supply as well as insects (mosquitoes) and rodents. The projectwould also finance labor intensive&#13;
physical interventions in an attempt to help in alleviatingthe high unemployment created by the&#13;
deterioration of the economic conditions in WBG. These interventions may be in the area of&#13;
agriculture, landscaping, parks, expansion of public facilities such as schools, health service&#13;
centers, community centers and other venues.&#13;
&#13;
Taking into account the likely investments, the Project has been placed in environmental&#13;
screening "Category B" in accordance with World Bank OperationalPolicy 4.01 (January 1998)&#13;
and requires preparation and implementationo f an EnvironmentalManagement Plan (EMP). As&#13;
an Emergency Recovery Operation, the Project has been prepared in accordance with World&#13;
Bank Guidelines OPBP 8.50, and does not require that an EMP be prepared prior to appraisal.&#13;
However, in order not to jeopardize quick project preparationand implementationto respond to&#13;
the affected populations, the Project ImplementingAgency would need to finalize the EMP and&#13;
submit to the Bank prior to effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
During project preparation, MDLF prepared a draft EMP for EMSRP I1 with support from&#13;
consultants. This EMP will be finalized before effectiveness and would be publicly disclosed in&#13;
the client country andthe Bank would, inturn, be authorized to disclose the EMP to its infoshop.&#13;
The Project would contribute to environmental improvements by increasing municipal service&#13;
quality and coverage, includingsolid waste collectionand management and wastewater services,&#13;
among other local community identified priorities. A limited number of micro civil works sub-&#13;
projects are expected to be financed under the Project, depending on demand, similar to those&#13;
&#13;
Project, Municipal Infrastructure Development Project, Emergency Response Program,&#13;
implemented under previous projects in WBG, including the Emergency Services Support&#13;
&#13;
Community Development Projects I and II and Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation&#13;
Project (EMSRP). Most of the likely investment activities would support rehabilitation and&#13;
improvements to existing infrastructure and service delivery with a sub-project value that is not&#13;
expectedto exceedUS$300,000 and would not require landacquisitionor resettlement.&#13;
&#13;
It is also recognized that some negative impacts which are easily mitigatedmay occur due to the&#13;
implementation of the rehabilitation and maintenance sub-projects. One such potential risk is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PCB contamination and other hazardous chemicals. The EMP would ensure that mitigation&#13;
measures are identified and followed during the various stages of project implementation.A Pest&#13;
Management Plan is also planned to be preparedand incorporatedinthe final EMP by December&#13;
3 1, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Once the Project is effective, the EMP would be monitoredthrough Bank supervisionmissions&#13;
and reviewedduring the Project mid-term review. The EMP will identify the potential negative&#13;
impacts of the sub-projects, provide the necessary mitigating measures, as well as guidelines on&#13;
site assessments and designs that will be prepared for infrastructure sub-projects to be&#13;
rehabilitatedand improved under this Project. The need for mitigation measures is likely to be&#13;
limited. However, should the need arise, the costs would be financed out of the allocation&#13;
providedto municipalitiesthroughtheir EAPallocations.&#13;
&#13;
Social Aspects. The increased tightening of closure, movement restrictions and unpredictable&#13;
curfews imposed on urbanareas for indefiniteperiodshave severely impactedPalestiniansociety.&#13;
As a result, many Palestinians have been denied access to essential services and sources of&#13;
emergency and development assistance.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed activities that would be financed through the EAP would be determined on a&#13;
demand-drivenbasis and be prepared by municipalitiesin consultationwith their communities to&#13;
the extent possible. Impact is expected to be quite broad, as over 131 municipal areas would be&#13;
covered, or nearly 70 percent of the populationwho would directly or indirectly benefit from the&#13;
proposedProject. Small communities and refugee camps not specificallywithin the scope of this&#13;
project would likely be supported by the Integrated Community Development Project (ICDP) for&#13;
which SupplementalFinancingis beingproposedin December 2006.&#13;
&#13;
As an emergency Project financing mainly service-related operating costs, potential adverse&#13;
social impacts are likely to be few, ifany, under this operation. However, as a means of ensuring&#13;
appropriate safeguards are in place, the MDLF will screen all emergency program assistance&#13;
requests and identify any that may have a potential adverse social impact. This would be done&#13;
through a dedicated Social Scientist based at MDLF who would be trained and familiar with&#13;
relevant Bank social safeguards. Appropriate mitigation measures would be designed to address&#13;
these and implementationof them would be monitored.&#13;

SECTIOND. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&amp; PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
Implementing Agency.        The implementing agency for EMSRP I1 will be the Municipal&#13;
Developmentand Lending Fund (MDLF). MDLF is an autonomousjuridical entity established&#13;
pursuant to the Council of Ministers Decree No. 32/36/09 dated October 20, 2005. The goal of&#13;
the MDLF is to assist municipalities in fulfilling their mandate as front line service providers to&#13;
their communities by providing them with a transparent, rules-based and efficient channel of&#13;
financing andtechnical assistance. Infulfilling this mandate, MDLF has and continues to seek to&#13;
forge operational alliances, mobilize financial resources and technical support, innovate and&#13;
introduce new approaches and global best practices in strengthening the capacity of&#13;
municipalities. The MDLF's operations are governed by its internal by-laws which set out its&#13;
structure, as well as the responsibilities of the Board, staff, committees and related entities.&#13;
Further, they set out the major principles of governance and operations. The principal office of&#13;
the MDLF is located in Al-Bireh, with a branch office in Gaza City.&#13;
&#13;
MDLF Operational Experience. MDLF carries forward the work of the Project Coordination&#13;
Unit and the Project Technical Secretariat (PCU/PTS), which were established in 2002 as&#13;
implementation units that previously operated under the auspices of the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government for European Commission and World Bank-financed projects. In particular, the&#13;
PCU/PTS implemented the first EMSRP (USD 20 million) funded by the World Bank, which&#13;
closed in March 2006 and the EMSP (Euros 30 Million) funded by the EC 2003-2006.&#13;
Subsequent contributions by other donors, includingthe Governments of Denmark and Italy are&#13;
currently under MDLF implementation.&#13;
&#13;
MDLF Mandate and Scope of Responsibilities. As a transaction-based executing agency, the&#13;
MDLF is not a decision-makingbody inthat it is neither empoweredto nor does it view within its&#13;
mandate the role of policy formulation. Rather, on the basis of programs and projects discussed&#13;
and agreed with its financing partners, the MDLF carries out with due diligence the planning,&#13;
implementation,monitoringand evaluation and reportingon the funds that it administers. It also&#13;
carries out, from time to time, analytical studies and prepares reports on topics of interest to&#13;
municipalities and its financing partners with the aim of providing insights and generating&#13;
information necessary to aid in formulating development and emergency assistance programs&#13;
supporting municipalities and local service provision. The MDLF also features an Innovation&#13;
Window throughwhich specialized programs and pilot projectscan be tested and mainstreamed if&#13;
successful or to achieve the desired demonstration effect.&#13;
&#13;
MDLF Board of Directors. MDLF's Board of Directors (the "Board") is the policy- and&#13;
strategy-settingauthority responsible for monitoringthe direction and performance of the Fund.&#13;
The Board consists of eleven voting Directors a majority of whom are representatives of civil&#13;
society andthe privatesector. The Boardcompositionis as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        Chairman ofthe Board(from the privatesector)&#13;
        A representative ofthe Ministry of LocalGovernment&#13;
        A representativeofthe Ministry of Planning&#13;
        A representativeofthe Ministry of Finance&#13;
        A representativeofthe Ministry ofthe Economy&#13;
        The Chairman of the Association of PalestinianLocal Authorities&#13;
        Three representativesfrom civil society, (no less than one of whom shall be a woman)&#13;
        A representativeofthe PalestineMonetaryAuthority&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    o A representativeofthe BanksAssociationappointed by the BanksAssociation.&#13;
&#13;
The full authority and responsibilitiesof the Boardare defined inthe founding decree and bylaws&#13;
that govern the affairs ofthe Fund. The major responsibilitiesofthe Boardincludethe following:&#13;
&#13;
    0    Approve the bylaws ofthe MDLF&#13;

    0    Adopt rules governing the Executive Director and any other positions approved by the&#13;
         Board&#13;
&#13;
MDLF Operations. The MDLF has adopted a dual accountabilitymanagement approach. It is&#13;
on the one hand accountable to its financing partners in implementingprograms and projects in&#13;
accordance with the stipulations of agreements it enters into. It is on the other hand accountable&#13;
to municipalities in disclosing information regarding its programs, ensuring transparency in its&#13;
operation and open access. To ensure objectivity in the review of its operations and as a sound&#13;
fiduciary measure, MDLF appoints an independent externalauditorto performduties described in&#13;
its Finance, Accountingand Auditing Manual. A detailed FinancialManagementand Accounting&#13;
Manualprovidesthe guidelineson which MDLF carries out its fiduciary function.&#13;
&#13;
The Fundhas seven departments. These departments(listed below) are paired into three working&#13;
groups: the knowledge base group, the management control group, and the LGU project support&#13;
group. The functions ofthe departments are shown in Table 1.&#13;
&#13;
    o Strategic PlanningandExternalRelations&#13;
    o Administrationand FinancialDevelopment&#13;

Flow of Funds &amp; Legal Relationships. The following chart illustratesthe main relationshipsand&#13;
flow of funds as discussed and agreed with Palestinian counterparts. The Recipient is the&#13;
PalestinianLiberation Organization (PLO) as with nearly all cases of assistance providedto the&#13;
Palestinians under the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank. Through the signing of a&#13;
subsidiary agreement, the PLO would designate MDLF as the executing agency for the project.&#13;
MDLF would then implement the project in accordance with Bank guidelines, the duly signed&#13;
LegalAgreements andthe ProjectOperations Manual.&#13;

Donor Coordination. As with EMSRP I,Donor Coordination will play a key role in project&#13;
implementation for the proposed second generation project. As such, an enhanced donor&#13;
coordinationstructure has been proposed to provide a framework for effective donor interaction,&#13;
reportingby MDLF, and to ensure adequatetransparency and accountabilityin implementationof&#13;
the project. For this purpose, a Donor Coordination Forum has been proposed, which would&#13;
count MOP, MOLG and MOF representatives among its members, would meet on a quarterly&#13;
basis, and would discuss the Quarterly Progress Reports (QPRs) prepared by the MDLF. An&#13;
institutional arrangements chart in Annex 6 further illustrateshow this mechanism would work&#13;
within the overallproject structure.&#13;

The WBG Country Financing Parameters (CFP) were approved on March 14, 2005, and made&#13;
financing of VAT and other reasonable taxes eligible under grant financing. Accordingly, and in&#13;
line with the CFP financing eligibility criteria, the WBG CFP was effectively applied as of&#13;
August 1, 2005, and all existing Credit/Grant Agreements were amended to reflect the new&#13;
guidelines. Furthermore, the CFP has been applied to all new operations ever since, the latest&#13;
being the Avian InfluenzaPreventionand Control Project approved on September 7, 2006. It is&#13;
expected that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will thereforemaintainthe same policies appliedto&#13;
existingprojectsfor VAT, import duties andtaxes on goods and servicesto this Project.&#13;
The Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF), through its main office in West Bank&#13;
and branch office in Gaza, will have the responsibility for project implementationas well as all&#13;
aspects of financial management including disbursement and reporting. MDLF is fully&#13;
established and has gained sufficient experience under the first Emergency Municipal Services&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (EMSRP I)to carry out the project's overall financial administration,&#13;
including accounting, monitoring, reporting and financial supervision of participating&#13;
Municipalities during the implementation of project activities. Furthermore, MDLF's Financial&#13;
Management Information System (FMIS) is fully integrated and has the ability to generate&#13;
reliable quarterly interim financial reports, monitor the budget andthe expenditures at the level o f&#13;
the Municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
Financial ManagementAssessment. The financial management assessmentwas conducted only&#13;
for MDLF. The current security situation on the ground did not allow the FinancialManagement&#13;
(FM) team to carry out an assessment, even on a sample basis, of selected Municipalities. The&#13;
capacity of municipalitieswas nonetheless discussedwith MDLF based on their experience under&#13;
EMSRP I.As far as MDLF is concerned, the financial management informationsystems in place&#13;
appear adequate and meet the minimum requirements of the Bank. MDLF operational manual&#13;
and the financial and accountingprocedures manual provides an adequate level of segregation of&#13;
duties and clear division of authoritiesand responsibilities. However, to ensure that the Manuals&#13;
are well aligned with the requirements of the Second Emergency Municipal Services&#13;
Rehabilitation (EMSRP II),     they will be updated to introduce therein (i) the detail funds flow&#13;
between MDLF and the Municipalities, (ii)the reporting arrangements includingthe periodicity&#13;
between the Municipalities and MDLF, and between MDLF and the World Bank; (iii)the&#13;
supervision mechanisms to ensure that the resources disbursed on behalf of the Municipalities&#13;
reach their intended beneficiaries. While MDLF FMIS is capable of producingreliable project&#13;
financial statements and interim financial reports in a timely manner, the same cannot be said&#13;
about the 131 Municipalities scheduled to benefit from the project. It was therefore agreed that&#13;
MDLF will design a reporting format to be followed by the Municipalities and that direct&#13;
transfers of funds to the latter will be limited to the bear minimum not to exceed a ceiling to be&#13;
agreed uponinthe Manuals.&#13;
&#13;
Staffing. The Financialand AccountingDepartment (FAD) at the MDLF will be responsible for&#13;
accountingand reporting under the Project. It is well structuredand its current staffing of: (i)a&#13;
Chief Financial and Administrative Officer (CFAO), (ii)two Senior Accountants in West Bank&#13;
Office and (iii)an Accountant in the Gaza Office will strengthened and the FAD restructured&#13;
accordingly. Under the new project, three Units or Divisions will be established, namely, an&#13;
Accounting unit, a Budget unit and one for Internal Control. Both the Accounting and Budget&#13;
units will be headed by a Senior Accountant assisted by an Assistant Accountant and an Internal&#13;
Controller will be hired for the InternalControl Unit. The staffing of the Gaza Office will stay as&#13;
it is. This change will therefore necessitatethe recruitmentof three new staffto meet the needs of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   FAD. The current staff has the relevant experience and background to manage the project. The&#13;
   CFAO is professionally qualified and has experience with Bank financial and disbursement&#13;
   procedures as well as those of other bilateral donors funding MDLF. The Accountants are also&#13;
   well qualified and familiar with Bank financial reporting requirements. To ensure that the same&#13;
   level of professionalismnotedunder EMSRP Iis maintained, the Bank will review and approve&#13;
   the CVs of all the new staff to be recruitedand ensure the process is carried out in a transparent&#13;
   manner incompliance with Bank procurement guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
   The current staff manages all ongoingprojectsat MDLF which include (i) the Local Government&#13;
   Capacity Building Projectfunded by the Danishgovernment throughthe Bank and (ii) the Italian&#13;
   project funded by the Italian Government. Since they will be responsible for EMSRP I1and any&#13;
   new projects in the future, the increase in staffing is quite appropriate. A capacity-building&#13;
   programwill also be designed to ensure that the staff stays current and capable of managing the&#13;
   project inthe most efficientway.&#13;
&#13;
   Project Components. The project has four main components for a total estimated cost of&#13;
   US$40.20 million, of which, US$lO.OOmillionwill be provided through a Bank Grant and the           ----&#13;
   remainingwill be parallel financing through the Agence Franqaise de Developpement (AfD) for&#13;
   about US$14.80 million and the Government of Netherlands for about US$6.30 million. The&#13;
   financing gap is about US$9,10million:&#13;

   Accounting System. MDLF computerized FMIS is Oracle-based and includes the following:&#13;
   General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivables, Purchasing, Inventory and Human&#13;
   Recourses and Payroll. The system can accommodate several on-going projects and has a&#13;
   reliable built-in security log-in system. It is also a flexible reportingtool, and its configuration is&#13;
   beingupgradedso as to automatically generate interimfinancial reports.The design of the system&#13;
   allows for the management of multi programs financed by different donors, and has the ability to&#13;
   provide detailed informationabout each program separately as well as consolidated information&#13;
   about all of MDLF projects and programs. It also facilitatesproper budgetingas it links budgeting&#13;
   with accounting and shows movements on budget lines.&#13;
&#13;
   The project's primary accountingresponsibility will be based at MDLF main office in the West&#13;
   Bank while the Gaza office will follow on all accounting aspects related to the operations in&#13;
   Gaza. Throughthe FMIS, the accountant in Gazawill recordall the financial transactions online.&#13;
   All those transactions will be reviewed, audited and posted by MDLF main office. MDLF&#13;
   accounting responsibilities will include maintaining all accounting records, supporting&#13;
   documents, undertaking bookkeeping of all financial transactions, preparing monthly bank&#13;
   reconciliation for the Special account, preparing quarterly interim financial reports, preparing&#13;
   annual financial statements, examining supporting documents for the purpose of making&#13;
   payments to contractors on behalf of Municipalities or making reimbursementsto Municipalities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for eligible expenditures duly settled by the latter and certified by MDLF engineers.. The&#13;
accounting basis for the project would be as defined in the MDLF financial and accounting&#13;
manual.''&#13;
&#13;
Although MDLF has the capability of keepingtrack of the expenditures at the municipal level,&#13;
proper recordingand reporting formats will be designed for the Municipalities to account for the&#13;
funds received and the activities financedunder the projects.This measure represents not only an&#13;
effort to reinforce project specific accounting measures, but also aims to strengthen municipal&#13;
capacity in financial reporting. These Municipal reports will be submitted to MDLF on a&#13;
monthly basis for internal audit and consolidation. The Gaza branch will report on financial&#13;
matters to the main office to allow MDLF to prepare annual financial statements, which will be&#13;
audited by a qualified independent auditor acceptable to the World Bank. Quarterly interim&#13;
Financial Reports will be prepared by MDLF and sent un-auditedto the World Bank within 45&#13;
days from the end of the relevant quarter. Given the large number of financial transactions&#13;
however, the project external auditors will be invited to review all the interim financial reports&#13;
every semester and send a corresponding reviewreportto the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
MDLF would maintain supporting documentation for expenditures on activities managed under&#13;
the project.    Books of accounts will be maintained on double-entry bookkeeping. Each&#13;
Municipality would provide MDLF with a monthly summary statement of expenditures based on&#13;
the books of accounts, along with other information and documents, to enable proper accounting&#13;
for these expenditures. Each participating Municipality would maintain separate books and&#13;
records in respect of transactions for activities under the project, those records will be kept&#13;
separately and not be consolidated with transactions not related to the project. Project records&#13;
should be kept in auditable condition all the time. For those expenditures made at the municipal&#13;
level, the original invoices would be maintainedat MDLF whereas copies of the invoiceswill be&#13;
kept in files at the Municipalities. This correspondsto the fund flow to be developed later in the&#13;
annex. It has been agreed that since MDLF is managing the Special Account and is fully&#13;
accountable for the uses of the resources, all original invoices should be kept at their main office&#13;
in West Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Budgeting System. The budgeting system is in place and is separate from the government&#13;
budgetingsystem. The MDLF would prepare an annual budget plan and update it on a quarterly&#13;
basis to reflect actual implementationand latest forecasts. Where feasible, municipality proposals&#13;
for funding would be accompanied by a proposed budget. This would facilitate better planning&#13;
and control. These plans would be periodically reviewed and updated along with the progress of&#13;
the project.&#13;
&#13;
Procedures of Internal Control. The Internal Control Procedures in place at MDLF have been&#13;
discussed during the project appraisal, agreed to with the Bank team and are fully documented in&#13;
the operationalmanual. A position of Internal Controller will be established to ensure a regular&#13;
monitoring of the processing of the transactions in compliance with the designed procedures..&#13;
The policies and procedures will provide reasonable assurance of (a) proper authorization of&#13;
transactions; (b) access to and use of assets and records; and (c) separation of custody of cash&#13;
from authorization and record keeping, and (d) segregation of duties. In addition, MDLF&#13;
operation manual and the financial and accounting procedures manual define the procedures of&#13;
control andthe relationbetweenthe Municipalitiesand MDLF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12MDLF FinancialManualwas submitted and reviewed by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Flow of Funds. Fund flow arrangements under the project have been designed to minimizethe&#13;
risks of errors or fraud and ensure funds do reachthe intended beneficiariesin a transparent and&#13;
timely manner with due regardto economy and efficiency. Toward that end, it has been agreedto&#13;
establish two levels of fund flow: first, between the Bank and MDLF through the Special&#13;
accounts, Direct Payments, and Special Commitments as further elaborated in the disbursement&#13;
arrangements below; and second, betweenMDLF andthe 131 participatingMunicipalities.&#13;
&#13;
At the second level, betweenMDLF andthe Municipalities,three mechanisms have been devised,&#13;
namely, (i)direct payments by MDLF to the contractors and suppliers for eligible expenses&#13;
incurred by the Municipalities and supported by duly certified contracts, invoices or any other&#13;
relevant documents; (ii)reimbursements by MDLF to Municipalities for payments made on&#13;
accounts of contractors, suppliers and supported by acceptable documentation (contracts,&#13;
invoices, vouchers, etc); and (iii) advances to Municipalities for the payments of the daily wages&#13;
under the Labor Intensive Employment scheme. The objective of this approach is two-fold; (a)&#13;
avoiding the setting up of multiple sub-accounts by the Municipalities and (b) not making large&#13;
advancesto Municipalitiesto bejustified a posteriori.&#13;
&#13;
Under the direct payment method, payments will be based on the approved Emergency&#13;
Assistance Program (EAP) of the Municipalities by MDLF. EAP will present the detail of all&#13;
eligible activities along with associated costs. The Municipalities will commit the resources, Le.,&#13;
hire the contractors in compliance with procedures agreed to with MDLF and acceptable to the&#13;
Bank; order the goods, etc. Once the services have been fully rendered (contractedcompleted,&#13;
goods delivered, etc.) the original invoices duly certified by LTCMDLF field engineers&#13;
(contractors) along with the relevant delivery notes will be sent to MDLF for review and&#13;
approval. Payments will then be made directly to the contractors or the suppliers and the&#13;
Municipalities informedaccordingly for proper records keeping. Inthe processthe Municipalities&#13;
will keep copies of all the documentation andthe originals will be filed at MDLF&#13;
&#13;
The second method will follow the same procedures as the previous ones, except payments are&#13;
made up front by the Municipalities using their own available resources before they seek&#13;
reimbursement from MDLF. Reimbursements to Municipalities Payments will be only for&#13;
eligible expenditures duly approved through the EAP by MDLF and supported by original&#13;
documentation. MDLF will review the supporting documents for eligibility and compliance&#13;
beforeauthorizingthe paymentsto the concernedMunicipalities'accounts.&#13;
&#13;
The third method of fund flow will concern mainly the Labor Intensive EmploymentGeneration&#13;
scheme. These payments are to temporary day laborers hired by the Municipalities to carry out&#13;
labor intensive activities. The beneficiaries do not have bank accounts and are paid on a daily&#13;
basis. Accordingly, MDLF will make advance payments to the municipalities not exceedingtwo&#13;
weeks of payments for the first batch of fund transfers. The use of those funds will bejustified&#13;
weekly on the basis of the list of workers signed by each beneficiary and includingthe relevant&#13;
information(the operation manual includesthe full descriptionof the procedures and the required&#13;
information). The workers attendance sheet will be reviewed by MDLF before additional funds&#13;
are transferred.Under this method, the initial advancewill be for two weeks, and replenishments&#13;
will be for one week at a time.&#13;
&#13;
To ensure that the funds are utilized for the intended purposes, MDLF field engineers will carry&#13;
out spot reviews of the Labor Intensivescheme on a sample basis and report back to MDLF main&#13;
office. The staff of the FAD will also undertake regular supervisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Interim Financial Reports. For project monitoringpurposes, quarterly interim financial reports&#13;
will be required. MDLF will be responsible for issuingthe relevant reports and submittingthem&#13;
to the Bank within 45 days after the end of the concerned quarters. The first quarterly interim&#13;
financial report will be submitted after the end of the first full quarter following the initial&#13;
disbursement.     Formats of the annual financial statements and the interim report will be&#13;
incorporatedin the operation manual. The accountingsoftware will have the capacity to produce&#13;
interim financial reports automatically incorporating all components, sub-components and&#13;
expenditure categories, as may be appropriate. The required quarterly interim financial reports&#13;
relatingto the projectconsist of:&#13;
&#13;
    (a) FinancialReports:&#13;
            i. ProjectSourcesandUsesofFunds;&#13;
           ii. Uses of Fundsby ProjectActivity (anexpenditurereportcomparingactual and&#13;
                 plannedexpenditures) alongwith a cash forecast for the subsequent        period;&#13;
                 and&#13;
           iii. Reconciliation statement of the SA. The reports will include a narrative&#13;
                 explaining all variances and the proposed corrective actions should be included&#13;
                 as an annex to the financial reports;&#13;
    (b) Physical Progress Reports to include narrative informationand output indicators linking&#13;
         financial informationwith physicalprogress; and&#13;
    (c) Procurement Reports: providing information on the procurement of the goods, works,&#13;
         services, training and selection of consultants showing procurement performance against&#13;
         plan, includinginformationon all authorized contract variations.&#13;
The above reports should be remittedto the Bank within 45 days from the end of the period.The&#13;
proposed reports, format and presentation will be discussed and agreed upon with the Borrower&#13;
duringprojectnegotiations.&#13;
&#13;
Project Financial Statements. In additionto the quarterly financial reports related to the project&#13;
activities,MDLF will produce its customary annual financial statements and consolidated interim&#13;
financial reports composedof&#13;
&#13;
    (a) A consolidated Statement of SourcesandApplications of Funds;&#13;
    (b) A consolidated use of funds by project categoriedactivities;&#13;
    (c) An SOE withdrawal schedule, listing individual withdrawal applications relating to&#13;
         disbursement throughthe SOE, by reference number, date and amount;&#13;
    (d) A FixedAssets Register fully updated and;&#13;
    (e) Notes on significant accounting policies and accounting standards adopted for the&#13;
    preparation of the accounts; and any supplementary information or explanationthat may be&#13;
    deemed appropriate by Management to enhance understanding of the financial situation of&#13;
    the project.&#13;
&#13;
Audit Arrangements. There will be annual audits of the project financial statements as well as&#13;
those of MDLF, covering all aspects of the project, including specific requirements for the&#13;
Municipalities and the NGOs receiving grants The audits will be performed by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to the Bank, and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing&#13;
(ISA), and the Bank's guidelines on auditing as stated in the guidelines: Annual Financial&#13;
Reporting and Auditingfor World Bank-Jinanced Activities (June 2003). The auditors' terms of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reference (TORs) will be prepared by the Audit Committee of the MDLF Board and cleared by&#13;
the Bank beforethe engagement of the auditor. They will include both the audit of the financial&#13;
transactions, an assessment of the internal control, flow of funds mechanisms, and the&#13;
reasonableness of the accounting, reporting and internal controls in respect of grant recipients,&#13;
mainly the Municipalities. The audit will cover on a sample basis selected Municipalities and&#13;
NGOto be funded under the project.&#13;
&#13;
The annual audit reports will consist of a single opinionon the financial statements of the project,&#13;
including the reconciliation of the Special Account (SA), and the Statement of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs) Withdrawal Schedule; as well as a Management Letter.            The audit reports will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank no laterthan six months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.&#13;
The cost of the audits will be eligible for financing from the Grant. MDLF will provide the&#13;
auditor with fill access to their own documents as well as the project-relateddocuments and&#13;
records, including the beneficiary Municipalities, and with the information required for the&#13;
purpose ofthe audit. Sample TORs for projectaudits will be includedinthe operationmanual.&#13;
&#13;
The audit would include a comprehensive review of all SOEs, and the management of the SA.&#13;
.The auditor would be expected to issue a consolidated management report covering all project&#13;
accounts and MDLF's with practical recommendations for improving the project's internal&#13;
control system. The Audit report should be sent to Bank not later than six months after the end of&#13;
the year.&#13;
&#13;
The establishmentof an InternalControl Unit will enhance even further the quality of the internal&#13;
review. A program of work will be elaborated on annual basis to ensure that the activities and&#13;
payments are properly monitored and reviewed. Due attention will be paid to ensuring that&#13;
project expenditures are properly authorized, supportingdocuments are maintained, accounts are&#13;
reconciled periodically and project assets, includingcash, are properly safeguarded. For internal&#13;
audit purposes, a detailed assetlinventory register will be maintained and all the Municipalities&#13;
will be visited to ensure compliance with the agreed upon procedures and the proper use of&#13;
resources. This measure will be further strengthenedby a paralleltechnical assistanceassignment&#13;
financed by the Government of Denmark and administered by the Bank that would help&#13;
municipalitiesestablish sound fixed asset registers.&#13;
&#13;
Supervision. Financialsupervisionactivitieswill include inter-alia,review of SOEs, reviewof&#13;
quarterly interimfinancial reports, review of annual audited financial statements and management&#13;
letters as well as timely follow up on issuesraisedby the auditor.There will be two financial&#13;
managementsupervisions each year duringthe two years of project implementation.The second&#13;
missionwill be mainly by the FM stafflocated inthe field office and will consist ofvisits to&#13;
MDLF and a sample of eligible Municipalitiesreceivinggrant finds. They will cover a reviewof&#13;
FMpractices, procurement methods, payment procedures and documentation to ensure consistent&#13;
and efficient applicationofthe financial management system.&#13;
Country Risks. The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) dated June 2004&#13;
concludes that the overall Public Finance Management (PFM) risk in WB&amp;G is adequate insofar&#13;
as the Bank's criteria and standard for approval of a general budget support operation (or&#13;
adjustment lending) are concerned. The 2004 CFAA rated the fiduciary risk as Significant. The&#13;
CFAA also noted that the PalestinianAuthority (PA) has made considerable progress between&#13;
2002 and 2004 towards the implementation of a Public Financial Management (PFM) system&#13;
which provides adequate financial control and transparency. Unfortunately, there has been little&#13;
improvement since 2004 and some of the previous improvements have unraveled. Furthermore,&#13;
the Financial Management risk Assessment dated November 2005 concluded that the financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
management project risk at 42% was one of the highest in the region. In addition, The PA's&#13;
liquidity crisis is unprecedented and salaries of civil servants salaries have not been paid since&#13;
March 2006. A massive walk out by the staff of the PA institutions would affect economic&#13;
activities in the West Bank and Gaza and could impact project implementation. Finally,&#13;
Municipalities are facing dire financial hardship and have not always been able to meet their&#13;
salary and other operatingobligations in a timely manner.&#13;
Although MDLF operates as an autonomous entity from the PA public finance system and their&#13;
staffs directly involved in project implementation are paid from the grant resources, it is not&#13;
immune from the PA institutional crisis. The PA liquidity crisis will not directly affect MDLF&#13;
since they receive funds directly from the Bank through the SA replenished from the Grant&#13;
resources. The reluctance of the banking system to deal with PA institution however could stop&#13;
the smooth flow of resources. For these reasons and the perceived risks of irregularities at the&#13;
nationaland municipal levels, the country risk is consequentlyratedhigh.&#13;
&#13;
Project Risks. The project risk from an FM perspective is considered substantial; although the&#13;
Financial Management Risk Assessment dated November 2005 rated EMSRP Irisk as High.&#13;
MDLF has since made some progress in implementingthe recommendations suggested then. In&#13;
addition, MDLF is a very experienced entity which has in place procedures and systems to&#13;
prevent financial irregularities. Through predecessor projects, MDLF has regularly issued its&#13;
audit reports on time and auditors' opinions have always been unqualified. The risk remains&#13;
however on the side ofthe Municipalitiesdue to:&#13;
         The large number (131) of Municipalities involved and the limited availability of staff at&#13;
         MDLF to monitor them all on a regularbasis&#13;
         The possibilitythat resources under the projectcould be divertedto uses other than those&#13;
         eligible under the project.&#13;
         The lack of proper knowledge as the Municipalities' capability at meetingthe reporting&#13;
         requirements in a timely manner and in compliance with the reportingformat and content&#13;
         agreedto wit h MDLF.&#13;
         The reliability of the data at the Municipal level since most of them have not been&#13;

&#13;
Risk Mitigation Measures. Mitigatingmeasureshave beenestablished to ensure all payments are&#13;
made by MDLF are based on invoices, contracts, etc., and duly certified by MDLF engineers. In&#13;
addition, MDLF's internal control system is quite reliable and spot reviews will be carried out.&#13;
The systems seem sound, MDLF does not appear to face financial issues and the FM capacity&#13;
assessment conducted confirmed the adequacy of the entity's FM system. But because of the&#13;
overall volatility in the country and the lack of adequate experience of the Municipalities and&#13;
NGOs the FM risk for this new Bank-financedproject to be implemented by MDLF would be&#13;
rated significant.&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion. The overall conclusion of the FM capacity assessment is that the Bank FM and&#13;
reporting requirements will be met. However, close supervisionduring project implementation&#13;
will be necessary&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements. Disbursements. The project will be implemented over a period of 30 months,&#13;
ending on June 30, 2009, corresponding to the disbursement timetable of the proposed Grant of&#13;

Disbursement Arrangements. MDLF will establish an SA in a commercial bank, acceptable to&#13;
the World Bank. Disbursementsfrom the Bank Grant will follow the transaction-based method,&#13;
Le., traditional Bank procedures: SOEs, Direct Payments, and Special Commitments. For certain&#13;
payments, above the "Minimum Application Size" as specified in the Disbursement Letter,&#13;
Withdrawal applications (WAS) will be submitted to the Bank for payments to suppliers and&#13;
consultants directly from the Grant Account.&#13;

will be conducted in accordance with Bank guidelines for "Procurement under IBRD Loans and&#13;
IDA Credits", May 2004; as well as those for "Selection and Employment of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers," May 2004. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) would be issued in&#13;
"United Nations Development Business" (UNDB) prior to the publication of the first Specific&#13;
ProcurementNotice (SPN).&#13;
&#13;
A County Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) for WBG was publishedin December 2004.&#13;
The procurement arrangements described for this program are largely based on its findings and&#13;
recommendations. As per CPAR recommendations, the following provisionsapplicableto NCB&#13;
will be includedinthe Trust FundGrant Agreement:&#13;
&#13;
   1.    Government-owned enterprises in the West Bank and Gaza shall be eligible to participate&#13;
         in bidding only if they can establish that they are legally and financially autonomous,&#13;

         by the Recipient,the standardbiddingdocuments ofthe Administrator shall be used&#13;
&#13;
In connection with the last point above, and as a follow on to the above CPAR, the Palestinian&#13;
Authority has developed a draft national public procurement law. Stakeholders, PA agencies,&#13;
representatives of private sector and the World Bank, attended two workshops in West Bank and&#13;
Gaza, arranged by the Ministry of Financed(MOF) in February 2006. The participantsprovided&#13;
their feedback and comments on the draft procurement law to the MOF. The draft needs to be&#13;
submitted to the PLC for review and endorsement.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Responsibilities: The MDLF, who will be referredto as the client, would act as the&#13;
main counterpart to the Bank for all procurement aspects of the project. Within this general&#13;
framework, the municipalities staff would work with the MDLF in preparing the initial&#13;
Procurement Plan for Component 1 (i)(rehabilitation and reconstructionof damaged municipal&#13;
infrastructure and facilities, as well as the supply of equipment to sustain municipal service&#13;
provision) and the contracted part of Component 2 (Labor-intensive Employment Generation),&#13;
and later prepare the procurement documents and carry out the daily work (under the supervision&#13;
of the MDLF). The MDLF would review the documents, to ensure compliance with the&#13;
provisions of the GA, includingthe Procurement Plan. The MDLF would then send the Bank all&#13;
requests for "no-objections'' on packages and contracts subject to prior review, before their&#13;
signature. Technical assistance on procurement from locally-based consulting firms and from&#13;
MOLG's regional offices would be provided to the municipalities. The consulting firms would&#13;
report directly to the MDLF on their review of procurement process at municipalities and advise&#13;
on timely corrective measures, if any, to be taken to avoid faulty procurement decisions at the&#13;
level of municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
The procurementarrangement for each component under the proposed project is clarified below:&#13;
&#13;
        Procurement of Component 1(i)(rehabilitation and reconstructionof damaged municipal&#13;
        infrastructure and facilities, as well as the supply of equipment to sustain municipal&#13;
        service provision), (US$ 7.0 million Bank financing) and the contracted part of&#13;
        Component 2 (Labor-intensive Employment Generation), (US$1-1 million Bank&#13;
        financing) would be done by the municipalities and monitored and controlled by the&#13;
        MDLF. Funds will be paid directly by the MDLF to the contractors, consultants and&#13;
        vendors after their invoiceshave beenreviewedand audited by the MDLF andthe Bank.&#13;
&#13;
    0   The same procedures would be adopted under Component 3(a) (pre-paid metering&#13;
        systems at municipalities- Bank financing US$0.50 million). As for component 3(b)&#13;
&#13;
        programming purposes - Bank financing US$0.7 million), an MOU attached to the&#13;
        (Piloting Local Government-NGO collaboration for emergency and other joint&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       partnership grant agreement will clearly identify those activities that are to be&#13;
       implementedby the NGO and those by the municipality and will specify the roles and&#13;
       responsibilities of each partner. Accordingly, each actor will be independently&#13;
       responsible for implementingthe procurement for its respective activities in accordance&#13;
       with the agreed procedures. The ProcurementManualfor bothBank's PNGO I11and the&#13;
       Emergency Municipal Services Restructuring Projects will include details on the&#13;
       procurement implementation arrangements under NGO-Local Government partnerships,&#13;
       the supervision role of NDC and MDLF and the provisions for joint procurement&#13;
       reporting.&#13;
&#13;
       Selectingconsultants, and procuringequipment and furniture under component 3 (MDLF&#13;
       Management Fee- Bank financing US$0.50million) will be carriedout by the MDLF.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF has prepared the Project Operational Manual (POM), which includes detailed&#13;
information on procurement with samples forms, bidding documents, bid evaluation forms and&#13;
sample communications letters. The POM will ensure that the procedures established in the&#13;
Grant agreement for the Project are followed. Progress in the preparation of the POM is being&#13;
monitored by the Director of MDF in coordination with the Bank. The POM should be ready&#13;
before negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
Because of the emergency nature of the Project, simplified bidding documents (in Arabic&#13;
language) will be usedto procuresmallcivil works and goods.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Methods: The procurement arrangements described below are summarized under&#13;
Table A. Thresholds for procurement methods and prior review arrangements are summarized&#13;
under Table B.&#13;
&#13;
       Civil Works (US$ 4.0 million).     Bid packages with an estimated contract value of&#13;
       US$lOO,OOO    equivalent or more, would be procured using NCB procedures and&#13;
       documents and advertisements in at least two local newspapers. NCB contractswould be&#13;
       open to eligible foreign bidders if they wish to participate. Bid evaluations would be&#13;
       submitted on Bank's Standard Bid Evaluation Forms for Procurement of Goods and&#13;
       Works of May 2004. Works contracts estimated to cost below US$lOO,OOO            would be&#13;
       procured using shopping procedures posting invitation to bid in at least two local&#13;
       newspapers, and would require soliciting, receiving and evaluating competitive&#13;
       quotations from at least three qualified contractors, Bid evaluation would also be&#13;
       submittedon Bank's Standard Bid evaluationform as explained above. Works contracts&#13;
       estimated to cost less than US$]0,000 would be procuredby obtainingthree competitive&#13;
       proposals from capable local contractors and awarding the contract to the contractor&#13;
       offering the lowest evaluated price. Under exceptional circumstances requiring Bank's&#13;
       prior clearance, these very small works (less than US$ 10,000) may be carried out by&#13;
       municipalities,as per paragraph3.8 (Force Account) of Bank Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
       Goods (US$ 3.0 million). Goods, such as solid waste collection containers and vehicle&#13;
       spare parts, necessary construction materials, i.e. cement, reinforcing steel rods, base&#13;
       course, asphaltingmaterial,tiles and other materials,water and sewage pipes and fittings,&#13;
       electric cables and transformers, street lighting poles, fuel, electrical bulbs, and office&#13;
       equipment and furniture would be financed out of the Emergency Program Assistance&#13;
       Component, the pre-paid metering under the second component and equipment and&#13;
       furniture under the management fee component. To the extent possible, goods would be&#13;
       grouped together in lots of similar items. Packages with an estimated contract value of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       US$lOO,OOO or more would be procured using National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
       procedures and documents acceptable to the Bank. These contracts would require&#13;
       advertisement in at least two local newspapers. NCB contracts would be open to eligible&#13;
       foreign bidders ifthey wish to participate. Bidevaluations would be submittedon Bank`s&#13;
        Standard Bid Evaluation Forms for Procurement of Goods and Works of May 2004.&#13;
        Goods contracts estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO would be procured using&#13;
        Shopping procedures and would require soliciting, receiving and evaluating competitive&#13;
        quotations from at least three qualified suppliers.Bid evaluationwould also be submitted&#13;
        on Bank's Standard Bid evaluation form as explained above Goods costing less than&#13;
        US$5,000 would be procuredthrough direct purchase from the nearest available source.&#13;
&#13;
   0    Services (US$ 0.5 million): For consulting services costing US$200,000 or more the&#13;
        Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) method would be used and would require&#13;
        advertisement of an Expressions of Interest in UN Development Business and the use of&#13;
        Bank's StandardRFP and EvaluationReport. For services costing less than US$200,000&#13;
        the selection method would be QCBS or QBS. For services provided by firms costing&#13;
        less than US$lOO,OOO the selection method would be Consultants' Qualifications (CQ).&#13;
        For services providedby firms costing less than US$ 50,000 the selection method would&#13;
        be Least cost (LC).&#13;
&#13;
        Short lists of consultants for consulting services estimated to cost less than $100,000&#13;
        equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance&#13;
        with the provisionsof paragraph2.7 ofthe Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
        For individual consultant the selection method would be based on Section V. of&#13;
        Guidelinesfor Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, of&#13;
        May 2004. Single Source Selection (SS) would be used under exceptional cases and&#13;
        would requireBank's prior review and `no objection'.&#13;

subcomponents plannedto be financed under the project.A separate section inthe plan listedthe&#13;
contracts planned under the management fee component. The plan would be updated in&#13;
agreement with the Bank to reflect the actual project implementationneeds, as more information&#13;
becomes available, and to reflect also the improvements in institutional procurement capacity.&#13;
Once information becomes available the procurement plan would include information on the&#13;
different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification,&#13;
estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame). All to be agreed between the client&#13;
and the Bank project team.       This procurement plan provides the basis for the proposed&#13;
procurement methods. They will also be available in the Project's database and in the Bank's&#13;
external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team&#13;
every three months or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and&#13;
improvements in institutionalcapacity.&#13;

Prior Review. (Table B provides informationon all prior review arrangements). The first three&#13;
contract packages in each category and each procurement method (works, goods and services),&#13;
irrespective of the estimated contract value, would be subject to Bank's prior review, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
accordance with the applicable guidelines. Thereafter, all contracts for works with an estimated&#13;
contract value above US$200,000 equivalent and any contract for goods with an estimated&#13;
contract value above US$lOO,OOO equivalent would be subject to Bank's prior review. All Force&#13;
Account works would be subject to Bank's prior review. Contracts with individual consultants in&#13;
excess of US$50,000 equivalent and with consultingfirms in excess of US$100,000 equivalent,&#13;
as well as all single-source contracts will be subject to prior review. All other contracts would be&#13;
subject to post-reviewon a random basis during supervisionmissions and procurement audits.&#13;
&#13;
Frequency of procurement supervision missions proposed: One every six months (including&#13;
special procurement supervision for ex-post-review)&#13;
&#13;
MDF Procurement Capacity:            Organization, Staffing and Professional Experience in&#13;
Procurement. Since it was established, the MDLF (PCU previously) has been implementing&#13;
bilaterally with a number of donor countries and international agencies including the Bank.&#13;
During appraisal, the mission assessed the current procurement capacity of the MDLF, The&#13;
assessment reviewedthe organizationalstructure for implementingthe projectand the interaction&#13;
between the project's staff responsible for procurement. It has been concluded that despite the&#13;
fact that the overall procurement experience gained from the implementation of EMSRF'I is&#13;
significant, the absence of an experienced procurement specialist didn't allow the consolidation&#13;
of an adequate procurement capacity. The MDLF has recently assigned one of its engineers as a&#13;
`procurement officer' to be responsible for the overall procurement procedures and methods&#13;
carried by the LGUs and MDLF, the `procurement officer' has limited experience in&#13;
procurement, most importantly in Bank procurement procedures and guidelines. Given the&#13;
important rolethat the MDLF would play in supervisingprocurement activities carriedout by the&#13;
municipalities, and a corrective measure, it has been agreed that the MDLF hires a procurement&#13;
specialist with proven experience in procurement to be financed under the proposed project.The&#13;
procurement specialist would assist the MDLF in the preparation of bidding documents, bid&#13;
evaluation and development of efficient and economic procurement strategies. The MDLF&#13;
Engineers have recently received some training on World Bank procedures and guidelines;&#13;
however, more training is still needed in order to handle the procurement of transactions under&#13;
the proposedprojectcompetently and in accordancewith the Bank's Guidelinesand procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Key Issues and Risks. The key issues and risks concerningprocurement for implementationof&#13;
the project have been identifiedand include:&#13;
-   The lack of an experienced Procurement Specialist.&#13;
-   Participatingmunicipalities lack the necessary fiduciary capacity and experiencewith World&#13;
    Bank procurement Guidelines.&#13;
-   Inadequate support to develop the procurementcapacity ofthe municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
The corrective measures which have been agreed are: (i)the recruitment of an experienced&#13;
procurement specialist to be in charge of the overall procurement function within MDLF, (ii)&#13;
delivery of procurement training to MDLF staff and municipalities (iii)The Bank will provide&#13;
quality control on procurement matters during supervision to ensure the efficiency of&#13;
procurement decisions (iv) Providing technical assistance on procurement to the municipalities&#13;
from locally-basedconsultingfirms and from MOLG's regionaloffices.&#13;
&#13;
Overall Procurement Risk Assessment is High. To address this risk, an action plan (AP)&#13;
outlined below was prepared and discussed with MDLF. This Plan will be formally agreed&#13;
before negotiations. The AP contains actions to strengthen the procurement capacity of MDLF&#13;
and to support the learningprocess in bothprocurement proceduresandcontract management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Recommendations/ActionPlan. The MDLF will needto be strengthened so as to bring it to the&#13;
level of the required capacity needed in implementingthe procurement aspects of World Bank&#13;
financed projects.To this end, the following actions are recommended:&#13;
&#13;
  1- A Procurement specialist would be hiredto assist the MDLF in implementingprocurement&#13;
       activities for the project. Hehhe would be selected on the competitive basis. Procurement&#13;
       specialist with proven procurement experience would work under the supervision of the&#13;
       MDLF Director.Clear TOR should be preparedand approved by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
  2- The procurement specialist would provide onjob trainingto MDLF staff andmunicipalities&#13;
       to help buildingtheir procurement capacity.&#13;
&#13;
  3-   The Bank's standard documents shall be used andthe appropriate Bank procedures shall be&#13;
       followed&#13;
&#13;
  4- The Bank would organize a training workshop to provide additional procurement&#13;
       knowledge about Bank procurement procedures; the workshop would address the specific&#13;
       needsofthe Project.&#13;
&#13;
Municipalities Procurement Assessment: An assessment of the capacity of the municipalities to&#13;
implement procurement actions for the proposed project has not been carried out as part of the&#13;
preparation mission due to time constraints, especially due to the short working hours during the&#13;
monthof Ramadan.An assessmentwhich was carriedout by the Bank in October 2005, in connection&#13;
with another Bank project, indicated a need for improvement in municipality staff capabilities to&#13;
implement procurement in accordance with the Bank procurement policies and procedures. This&#13;
capacity has yet to be assessed. The previous assessment did not cover a sufficient number of&#13;
municipalities, and therefore, a new assessment will be carried out by randomly selecting 5-7&#13;
municipalities out of 131 considered for the proposed project. The assessment would review the&#13;
organizationalstructure for implementingthe project, in respect of knowledgeof internationalpublic&#13;
procurement in general and familiarity with the Bank procurement in particularand understanding of&#13;
the need for a procurement strategy to achieve efficient and prompt procurement. In order to avoid&#13;
delays in processing this operation, the procurement arrangement has been based on the previous&#13;
assessmentwith highrisk rating. The assessmentwould be carried afterwards, and ifthe ratingwould&#13;
change, the procurementarrangement would be revised accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Training. To strengthen procurement capacity at the municipalities, the MDLF would&#13;
arrange for procurement training during the first quarter of the first year to help those Municipalities&#13;
which are not familiar with Bank procurement guidelines. The MDLF would contract procurement&#13;
specialist'firm to carry out the procurement training during the project duration and would prepare a&#13;
standardized procurement training materials, some other training may also be done by the MDLF&#13;
staff. The training would include preparation of bidding documents and bid evaluation reports for&#13;
goods, works and services. Based on the result of Midterm review and the post review, the MDLF&#13;
would assess the sufficiency of training provided to the Municipalities and its beneficial effects on&#13;
procurement capacity. Procurement coaching in the form of continuous dialogue between the MDLF&#13;
and the municipalitieswould be assured during the life of the project.&#13;

SECTIONE: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL JUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
The proposed emergency Project is being prepared under emergency recovery assistance&#13;
procedures (OP/BP 8.50).       Time limitations and limited availability of economic data prevent&#13;
more detailed analysis, a recognized constraint in preparing such operations. The principal&#13;
benefitofthe Projectwould be to restore essential municipalservices, includingwater supply and&#13;
sanitation services, solid waste collection, and electricity supply to a significant portion of the&#13;
Palestinian population. Improved municipal service coverage and quality would help mitigate&#13;
deteriorating health and sanitary conditions in WBG, reducing health risks while generating&#13;
economic activity. Infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance services supported under the&#13;
Projectwould also reducethe rapid depreciation in the value of municipalassets, includingroads,&#13;
wastewater treatment facilities, solid waste collection vehicles, transformers and water pumps,&#13;
thus reducing the burden on the capital budget for replacement costs. In addition, targeted&#13;
assistance to communities with higher incidences of poverty and unemployment through labor-&#13;
intensive employment generation subprojects would mitigate some of the harshest effects of the&#13;
economic contraction.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed Projectwould support demand-driven initiativesto improvemunicipalservicesthat&#13;
would benefit 131 municipal areas and over 70 percent of the population. While the potential&#13;
economic benefitsare likely to materialize in these communities, they are difficult to measure in&#13;
aggregate. However, several measures have been taken in the project design to promote&#13;
achievement of these benefits. First, a positive list of sub-projects has been agreed, all of which&#13;
would contribute to improvingthe livelihoods and well-being of the communities in which they&#13;
are implemented, while screening out alternative uses of funds that would yield little or no&#13;
benefit. Second, an M&amp;E system would be initiatedby MDLF through the EAP applicationform&#13;
and MIS database to establish the baseline conditions (service areas to be improved) for each&#13;
subproject financed under Component l(a), as well as the performance indicator for service&#13;
improvement. This data would be gathered through the EAP and would be used to populate the&#13;
MISdatabaseto measure economic and other benefitsin different service areas. Ineach instance&#13;
where such data can be gathered during the subproject identification and design phase, the&#13;
number of direct and indirect beneficiariesin the affectedsubproject area would be recordedand&#13;
tracked.&#13;
&#13;
Bearing in mind the typology of infrastructure to be financed under Component l(a) (no sub-&#13;
project would exceed US$500,000), the main emphasis is placed on restoring infrastructure&#13;
services at the lowest cost possible against acceptable industry standards. As such, subproject&#13;
selection would be justified by applying a least cost approach. This would be confirmed at&#13;
MDLF's review/appraisalof the proposed subproject. Bank procurement guidelines, which place&#13;
emphasis on achieving economy and efficiency, would also contribute to this outcome. In&#13;
instances where budgetary support is being provided for the purchase of spare parts, fuel and&#13;
electricity (street lighting) attempts to quantify impact will be made in standard units to measure&#13;
aggregate impact in these service areas and for comparative purposes. No such baseline exists at&#13;
this time due to the demand-drivennature ofthe project.&#13;
&#13;
In the case of labor-intensive employment generation sub-projects financed under Component 2,&#13;
least cost methodologies cannot be applied since the emphasis on labor intensity would preclude&#13;
using capital intensive approaches that may in some cases be less expensive. In such cases, any&#13;
assets developed under the sub-projects would be considered a positive spillover benefit. As&#13;
such, measurementof economic benefitswould focus on the number of man-daysof work created&#13;
under this Component per dollar spent.&#13;
&#13;

                                           ANNEX 4:&#13;
                         Bank Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
In a Quality of Supervision Assessment Report (QSA6) carried out in September 2004 by the&#13;
Bank's internal Quality Assurance Group (QAG), project supervision for EMSRP I was rated&#13;
Highly Satisfactory overall. The Task Team and Region were commended for being able to&#13;
respond to the demands of an emergency operation while also pursuing medium-term&#13;
development goals. In particular, project design was acknowledged to be sound in the way&#13;
decentralized, regionally-basedsupport was providedto municipalities through the contractingof&#13;
regional technical consultants who worked effectively in providing outreach services to the&#13;
scattered project municipalities. One short-coming of the project, however, was the complexity&#13;
and difficulty in mobilizing the Management Agent contract, which caused some delay in project&#13;
implementation and sheds light on the difficulty of undertaking complex assignments requiring&#13;
substantial internationaltechnicalexpertise.&#13;
&#13;
A particular focus of EMSRP 11, based on the preliminary findings of an Implementation&#13;
Completion Report (ICR) from EMSRP I,will be to establish a sound and effective system for&#13;
project impact and results monitoring. Such an approach needs to be designed with caution, as&#13;
there are factors beyond the control of municipalities that can have an impact on outcomes.&#13;
Moreover, as an emergency operation, a results focus should be directedat the mainobjectivesof&#13;
the emergency operation, addressing questions as to how municipal services were enhanced with&#13;
EMSRP I1 support and with what degrees of efficiency. A combination of factors inherent in&#13;
EMSRP I1design as an emergency operation, coupled with the fact that it is demand-driven with&#13;
a significant portion of the financing being provided for recurrent expenditures will make results&#13;
measurement a challenge. In particular, some elements of budgetary support will be difficult to&#13;
monitor in terms of their impact. However, in instances where infrastructure rehabilitation is&#13;
being financed, specific measures to establish baseline indicators have been identified during&#13;
preparation.&#13;
&#13;
Effective gathering of baseline indicators for activities to be identified by the beneficiary&#13;
communitieshas already been initiatedand would be a particular focus of the MDLF within the&#13;
first 6 months of the Project life. The updated Results Framework, including baseline data and&#13;
targets establishedthrough the screening and approvalof each municipality EAP applicationwill&#13;
be submitted by the MDLF as an annex to the Quarterly Progress Report (QPR) startingwith the&#13;
second reporting quarter period. Accordingly, the project will continue to be monitored by the&#13;
MDLF to ensure that basic tools for managing infrastructure rehabilitated assets and basic&#13;
municipal services are sustained during the Project timeframe, and that lessons learned are&#13;
incorporatedto recommend follow up operations, once the conditions allow for a developmental-&#13;
orientedapproach.&#13;
&#13;
During supervision, measures will be taken to insure effective follow up with municipalities and&#13;
effective monitoringofthe projectperformance, including&#13;
&#13;
(i)      Quarterly Progress Reports:To be prepared and compiled by the MDLF. Such progress&#13;
        reports usually include, inter alia, narrative information on progress and output&#13;
        indicators, linking financial information with physical progress, and reporting on issues&#13;
        that requireattention.&#13;
&#13;
(ii)    Regional Consultants: Component 4 will finance the recruitment of 4 Regionaltechnical&#13;
        consulting firms to provide technical project implementation, environmental and social&#13;
        expertise to liaise between the municipalities and their constituencies, contractors, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         the MDLF, and assist the MDLF in project supervision. Carefulattention will be paidby&#13;
         the MDLF to the performance of Regional Consultants in insuring compliance with&#13;
         environmental and social issues during project implementation. 3 Regional Consultants&#13;
         will be recruitedinthe West Bank and 1 in Gaza.&#13;
&#13;
(iii)   M &amp; E Specialist: Under Component 4, the Projectwill support the MDLF to cover the&#13;
         costs of a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist to assist the MDLF in following up with&#13;
         municipalitiesandthe regional consultants.&#13;
&#13;
(iv)    BIAS:Two Beneficiary Impact Assessments (BIAS)will be implemented: One after 12&#13;
         months of project life, and one at Project Closing.The purpose of the BIASis to provide&#13;
         feedback on the impact of the financed activities on the beneficiary communities, the&#13;
         quality of basic municipal services, andthe level of beneficiarysatisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
(v)     MIS Database: A MIS at the MDLF including a project database will be in place to&#13;
         collect and classify data gathered from municipalities on priorities for infrastructure&#13;
         rehabilitation and budgetary support, municipal,finances, employment generation data,&#13;
         and other relevant data. This would be a major enhancement to EMSRP in that it would&#13;
         both strengthen the capacity of MDLF in its ability to gather and analyze project-specific&#13;
         and sector data, in addition to allowing for more effective M&amp;E relatingto EMSRP I1&#13;
         performance and impact. The management and operation of the MIS will be the&#13;
         responsibility of the M&amp;E Specialist, with support from the IT Specialist at the MDLF.&#13;
         Each progress report issued to the Bank and to other donor co-financiers would provide&#13;
         up-to-date information drawn from the MIS, based on the agreed M&amp;E Framework and&#13;
         Project Impact Indicators. Support to MDLF in refining its MIS system and in training&#13;
         and capacity building of its staff as well as municipal staff would be provided by a&#13;
         Municipal Services Specialist who would be financed under the Institutional&#13;
         Development Component of the Danish Local Government Capacity Building Project&#13;
         (LGCBP).&#13;
&#13;
Reviews: In addition to regular supervision by Bank staff and interaction with the MDLF,&#13;
reviewsto assess progress in implementingthe agreed activities will be carried out during at least&#13;
one Bank supervisionmission together with the client organizations and financiers. This will be&#13;
part of the client-donor coordination process. The MDLF will be responsible for preparing the&#13;
necessarydocumentation for the reviewsand for planningthe review meetings.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, a Mid Term Review will be carried out by the Bank 12 months after project&#13;
effectiveness to assess progress under the project, achievement of overall objectives, identify&#13;
measures to improve performance, if needed, and to eventually reorient the Project if needed to&#13;
ensure that it achieves its objectives.&#13;

            West Bank and Gaza - Second Emergency
            Municipal Serevices Rehabilitation Project

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of Second Emergency
            Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project for West Bank and
            Gaza are to: (i) help mitigate further deterioration in the
            delivery of essential municipal services, including solid
            waste collection, street lighting, provision of water,
            wastewater and electricity services (where such services are
            provided by municipalities), and street cleaning, among
            other services, through rehabilitation of damaged or
            deteriorating infrastructure and the provision of non-wage
            budgetary support for direct service cost inputs; (ii)
            create temporary job opportunities at the local level
            through the launching of labor-intensive employment
            generation schemes, proportionally allocated on the basis of
            an unemployment index; and (iii) pilot innovative
            initiatives that foster local government-NGO collaboration
            in response to urgent community needs and assist
            municipalities in recovering costs for the provision of services.
