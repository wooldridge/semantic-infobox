APPROACHES TO PURCHASING POWER PARITY AND REAL PRODUCT&#13;
COMPARISONS USING SHORTCUTS AND REDUCED INFORMATION&#13;
It is generally recognized that international comparisons&#13;
of relative levels of income should be carried out with national&#13;
incomes converted to a common currency using purchasing power&#13;
parities (PPP). The usual practice has been to make the conversion&#13;
using exchange rates, and this has been shown to give very inaccurate&#13;
results. Unfortunately, reliable estimates of PPPs are available&#13;
for only a handful of countries because the standard benchmark&#13;
J&gt; method of making estimates of them requires a very substantial&#13;
commitment of time and resources. The present work investigates&#13;
various procedures for estimating PPPs (or, equivalently, real&#13;
national incomes) which are more economical in their requirements.&#13;
Two approaches are pursued here: (1) a short-cut approach&#13;
which attempts to exploit structural relationships between real&#13;
national income in a country and associated monetary and/or non-&#13;
monetary indicators; and (2) a reduced information approach in&#13;
~-   which PPPs are estimated on the basis of small subsets of price&#13;
data which can be collected cheaply in the countries being compared.&#13;
Shortcuts based on a monetary indicator, nominal income,&#13;
sX   and supplemented with other financial and physical indicator&#13;
variables, provide a basis for estimating PPPs which is a subs-&#13;
tantial improvement over the use of exchange rates. Furthermore,&#13;
a systematic experimentation with a large data base collected for&#13;
international comparisons suggests that a significant reduction in&#13;
the number of prices collected in each country could be carried out&#13;
without serious degradation of the quality of PPP estimates.&#13;

APPROACHES TO PURCHASING POWER PARITY AND REAL PRODUCT&#13;
COMPARISONS USING SHORTCUTS AND REDUCED INFORMATION&#13;
1.        INTRODUCTION&#13;
The inadequacy of official rates of exchange as a basis&#13;
for comparing the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) of different coun-&#13;
tries has been widely recognized in economic literature. For&#13;
instance, in 1970 and 1973, real GDP in India relative to the US&#13;
based upon an estimate of the overall purchasing power parity (PPP)&#13;
of the Indian currency, was more than three times the value shown&#13;
when the conversion was made using exchange rates. 1/ Further,&#13;
changes in exchange rates either as a result of a country's devalua-&#13;
tion or as a consequence of its decision to allow its rate to float&#13;
freely may produce comparisons which are totally unrelated, over both&#13;
time and space, to relative real growth in the countries being&#13;
compared. The recent experience of Japan vis-a-vis the US is a case&#13;
in point. From mid-1977 to mid-1978, real per capita GDP grew by&#13;
4.4 percent in Japan and 3.1 percent in the US, raising the level&#13;
of per capita GDP in Japan relative to that in the US by 1.3 percent.&#13;
However, if official exchange rates which registered a 33 percent&#13;
appreciation in the Japanese yen over the same period, were used,&#13;
the per capita real GDP in Japan relative to the US appeared to have&#13;
increased in just one year by 35 percent!&#13;
Obviously, there needs to be a better alternative to&#13;
conversions by exchange rates. A proper alternative is the true&#13;

purchasing power parity of a currency as observed not merely over&#13;
internationally traded goods and services, but over the entire GDP.&#13;
Estimating the PPP involves pricing comparable sets of commodities&#13;
and services in different countries and combining the individual&#13;
price relatives with appropriate quantity weights.&#13;
The pioneer work in this field was that of Gilbert and&#13;
Kravis (1954), 2/ which produced binary comparisons between the US&#13;
and four European countries--the United Kingdom (UK), France,&#13;
Germany and Italy-for 1950. Gilbert and Associates (1958) 3/ later&#13;
extended the comparisons to a few more European countries for both&#13;
1950 and 1955. Other national and international agencies have&#13;
calculated purchasing power parities for groups of countries. 4/&#13;

Both Gilbert and Kravis (1954) and Gilbert and Associates&#13;
(1958) had dealt only with European countries and mainly had made&#13;
binary comparisons with the US. The ICP extended that work in two&#13;
fundamental ways. First, it included countries with widely varying&#13;
geographic locations (four continents), economic performance (poor&#13;
as well as rich) and organization of production and distribution&#13;
(socialist as well as capitalist). The purpose was to develop a&#13;
methodology that could encompass all the countries in the world.&#13;
Second, it emphasized multilateral comparisons, the main purpose&#13;
being the simultaneous solution of all possible parities so as to&#13;
achieve transitive base-invariant comparisons among the countries.&#13;
The project has also produced benchmark data that are&#13;
invaluable for future work. Between the Phase I and Phase II&#13;
reports, the ICP produced comparisons for 16 countries for 1970 and&#13;
1973, and for seven of these countries, for 1967 also. The work of&#13;

chasing power parity comparisons, initiated by the Inter American&#13;
Development Bank, the ECIEL and the UN Economic Commission for Latin&#13;
America and implemented in cooperation with the ICP--would extend&#13;
the coverage even further and perhaps will succeed in developing&#13;
linkages among the various regional and interregional comparisons.&#13;
1.1       Subject of This Investigation&#13;
There are a number of drawbacks to the extensive projects&#13;
such as the ICP. Unfortunately, they involve resources far beyond&#13;
the capabilities of individual researchers. Further, they require&#13;
the cooperation of many national organizations. Many countries do&#13;
not have high levels of interests in this type of projects or&#13;
sophisticated statistical organizations to undertake the work.&#13;
Additionally, even for countries participating in such projects,&#13;
their scope makes it impractical to produce full-scale comparisons&#13;
for more than some benchmark years, perhaps evey five or ten years.&#13;
For intervening years, some simpler procedures must be adopted.&#13;
Thus, for reasons of cost, lack of interest and expertise,&#13;
and in order to fill the gaps in intra-benchmark years, shortcut&#13;
methods or methods based on reduced information need to be found,&#13;
methods that can duplicate the results of the ICP-type study, but which&#13;
will not involve as much work and expense. The present study is an&#13;
investigation into such procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5-&#13;
1.2.      The Methods Analyzed&#13;
The methods being investigated here may be divided into two&#13;
broad categories. One is called shortcuts because the methods seek to&#13;
produce real income comparisons with the help of various monetary and&#13;
non-monetary indicators and would eliminate price collection. The&#13;
shortcut methods are in turn divided into two sub-categories: those&#13;
based upon monetary indicators and those based upon physical indica-&#13;
tors. The former seek to establish, using available data, the rela-&#13;
tionship between PPP and some readily available monetary indicators&#13;
such as official exchange rates and to predict the relative real&#13;
income levels for countries and time periods for which reliable PPP&#13;
estimates are not available. The second subcategory--shortcuts&#13;
using physical indicators--are designed to achieve the same results&#13;
by estimating relationships between real per capita income (or&#13;
consumption) and various physical or non-monetary indicators such as&#13;
consumption of cement, milk or newsprint, or stocks of telephones,&#13;
motor vehicles, or television sets.&#13;
The second category of methods, called reduced information&#13;
methods, involves defining a basket of items which is much smaller than&#13;
the total ICP sample but which will nevertheless represent the entire&#13;
country efficiently in a price comparison. These methods should be&#13;
capable of producing comparisons at the highest levels of aggregation,&#13;
viz., the GDP, but at the same time provide enough detail on price&#13;
structures to permit comparisons of various major components such as&#13;
consumption, capital formation, or goverment, or even of more detailed&#13;
subaggregates such as food, clothing or transportation. Three kinds of&#13;
reduced information procedures are addressed here: (a) those using&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
published data; (b) those using mechanical or ad hoc approaches to&#13;
reduced information; and (c) those using systematic or regression&#13;
methods of reduced information.&#13;
The reason for the search for reduced information procedures&#13;
is, as noted, a desire to minimize the cost of collecting the prices&#13;
needed for ICP-type comparisons. This cost will be less if regularly&#13;
published data can be used. An often-mentioned source is the set of&#13;
data underlying the Consumer Price Index (CPI), but these data lack&#13;
international comparability in terms of quality and coverage. The&#13;
primary use for such data is for time-to-time comparisons, as contrasted&#13;
with place-to-place comparisons.&#13;
Large bodies of data on international costs of living do&#13;
exist which are more or less internationally comparable; however,&#13;
they are collected to compute compensatory allowances for employees&#13;
stationed in various countries. The best known sources are those&#13;
of the UN and governmental agencies of the US and the Federal Republic&#13;
of Germany. 9/ These data cover many countries and are available&#13;
at no cost. In the present work, the UN and US data were examined to&#13;
see how, if at all, they could be used in estimating a system of&#13;
PPPs.&#13;
The reduced information procedures that seek to produce ICP-&#13;
type comparisons with a minimum of data on prices and expenditures&#13;

- 7 -&#13;
are based on the premise that item prices are correlated and, there-&#13;
fore, that it should be possible to eliminate some items without&#13;
materially affecting the final comparisons.&#13;
The simple, ad hoc or mechanical method of reduced informa-&#13;
tion, seeks to eliminate categories or items on the basis of arbitrary&#13;
cutoff points determined by the expenditure weights associated with a&#13;
category or by the frequency with which the ICP sample of countries&#13;
responded to requests for prices of items. The more systematic reduced&#13;
information method seeks to determine, using a regression equation&#13;
procedure, a set of item prices that offers the best basis for predic-&#13;
ting the PPP at a predetermined level of aggregation. However, no&#13;
price or expenditure information is truly redundant, and reducing the&#13;
sample size involves errors. Thus, the greater the cuts in the sample&#13;
size, the greater the savings in the costs of collection, and the&#13;
greater the errors. The objective with reduced information procedures,&#13;
then, is to maximize the reduction of the sample size relative to the&#13;
cost of errors associated with the reduction.&#13;
There may be other ways of getting a measure of the&#13;
importance or redundancy of items for PPP calculations, In the ICP&#13;
work, all items are classified into categories on the basis of the&#13;
functions they perform, as viewed by the final purchaser. However, the&#13;
differences in the price structures of countries are more indicative of&#13;
the way inputs are organized to produce an item than of the way the&#13;
item is put to use in final consumption. In poorer countries, services&#13;
are traditionally cheaper and capital-intensive manufactures riove&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

expensive than in richer countries. If the ICP items are reclassified&#13;
along lines that differentiate input requirements and organization of&#13;
production, viz., service, agricultural products, non-processed and&#13;
processed food, durable and non-durable consumer goods and the like,&#13;
the comparisons may reveal tendencies which allow the sample size to be&#13;
reduced substantially while still getting acceptable results. However,&#13;
an investigation along these lines has not been attempted because&#13;
benchmark data for intermediate products have not been available.&#13;
2.         SHORTCUT COMPARISONS WITH MONETARY INDICATORS&#13;
The evidence suggests that compared with purchasing power&#13;
parities (PPP), exchange rates (ER) systematically underestimate the&#13;
income levels of developing countries relative to developed countries.&#13;
Further, the extent of the underestimation increases with the disparity&#13;
between the per capita income levels of countries. When per capita&#13;
GDP, as converted using exchange rates, is denoted as nominal (Z) and&#13;
the corresponding PPP converted value as real income (Y), and both are&#13;
expressed as indices using US = 100, the index of nominal GDP (z) was,&#13;
for every country in the ICP Phase I report, invariably lower than the&#13;
corresponding index of real GDP (y). The ratio of the real index to&#13;
the nominal one (which is the same thing as the ratio of the exchange&#13;
rate to the PPP) was as high as 3.05 for India, a low-income country,&#13;
and as low as 1.15 for Germany, a high-income country.&#13;
Attempts have been made to explain this phenomenon in terms&#13;
of a productivity differential hypothesis; it has been put forward at&#13;
various times by Ricardo, Viner, Harrod and Balassa. The arguments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
which have been summarized in KHS (1978b) 10/ are briefly as follows.&#13;
International trade tends to equalize prices of traded goods, mainly&#13;
commodities, in different countries. Countries with higher producti-&#13;
vity will enjoy higher wages. Internal competition will tend to&#13;
establish the level of wages of the high-trade sector in the non-traded&#13;
or services sector. Since international productivity differentials are&#13;
higher in traded goods than in non-traded goods, the relative price of&#13;
services will be higher in high-income countries than in low-income&#13;
countries. Exchange rates reflect prices of traded goods, while the&#13;
PPPs are computed from prices of all goods and services, traded or not.&#13;
Thus the poorer a country, the lower will be the relative prices of its&#13;
non-traded goods and the greater will be the tendency for exchange&#13;
rates to underestimate its real income relative to that of a richer&#13;
country.&#13;
In the real world, many circumstances may frustrate these&#13;
arguments. A poor country with an abundance of natural resources and&#13;
human capital may have a high relative price of services. 11/ The&#13;
existence of transport costs, trade restrictions, exchange controls and&#13;
large unrequited transfers may prevent the development of the clear and&#13;

consistent pattern of differences between PPPs and exchange rates that&#13;
would be expected under the productivity differential model.&#13;
If it is indeed true that the apparent disparity between&#13;
exchange rates and PPPs, as measured by exchange rate deviation indices&#13;
(defined as the ratio of the exchange rate to the PPP), can be explained&#13;
by relative levels of real per capita income, then a shortcut method&#13;
for making international comparisons can be developed by estimating a&#13;
relationship between nominal and real income indices, using available&#13;
data and predicting the relative real income levels of countries for&#13;
which only nominal income figures are available.&#13;
A number of writers have put forward such shortcut formulas.&#13;
Widely cited is that of David, 12/ which states that the real percent-&#13;
age gap between the per capita GDP of the US and that of another&#13;
country is only fourth-ninths the percentage gap as measured by values&#13;
when converted by exchange rates. Using data from Gilbert and Kravis&#13;
(1954), Gilbert and Associates (1958) and Maddison (1967), David&#13;
estimated the equation:&#13;
1          1&#13;
(y -1) = B (z -1) + u                      (1)&#13;
in which&#13;
B = .441, or four-ninths.               (2)&#13;

The "rule-of-four-ninths" as formulated by David was&#13;
questioned by Balassa, Samuelson and Hulsman-Vejsova. 13/ An extensive&#13;
search for a new formula using not only the observations David used but&#13;
also additional observations taken from the ICP Phase I report reveals&#13;
that the "rule-of-four-ninths" cannot be supported: the value of the&#13;
coefficient which provides the "rule" changes from sample to sample and&#13;
is not stable.&#13;
The following quadratic equation in nominal index is, on the&#13;
-2&#13;
other hand, found to have high R and stable coefficients, with an&#13;
additional property-as compared with other plausible alternatives, it&#13;
produces smaller errors for the poorer countries for which it is more&#13;
likely to be used:&#13;
Yi= 1 + 1.409 (zi-l) - .450 (zi -1)&#13;

R2= .98               df = 32&#13;
However, the stability of this quadratic formula has been&#13;
demonstrated only for the pre-1971 era, when there were fixed exchange&#13;
rates. There is considerable doubt about its validity in the current&#13;

regime of managed floating currencies. Beside, any formula such as&#13;
this which has only one independent variable would fail to change the&#13;
ranking in terms of estimated values of countries observed in the&#13;
nominal index. Thus two countries with the same nominal income index&#13;
would appear to have the same real income index. This in turn implies&#13;
that they also have the same levels of prices when converted by exchange&#13;
rates. However, a number of factors might lead to different price&#13;
levels for countries with the same nominal income indices, among them&#13;
the ratio of exports plus imports to GDP, the extent of deficits in the&#13;
balance of trade, direct taxes as a proportion of GDP, current receipts&#13;
from tourism, and the ratio of the increase in exports of manufacturers&#13;
to the increase in manufactured outputs. Attempts were made to use&#13;
these factors as independent variables in regression equations explain-&#13;
ing the overall PPP. The results were disappointing. Kravis, Heston&#13;
and Summers successfully used two variables--openness and price isola-&#13;
tion. 14/ That their results are further improved by using these&#13;
variables in conjunction with physical or non-monetary indicators is&#13;
discussed below.&#13;
3.          SHORTCUTS WITH NON-MONETARY OR PHYSICAL INDICATORS&#13;
A shortcut with physical indicators seeks to establish&#13;
relationships between per capita real income on the one hand and&#13;
various physical or non-monetary indicators such as consumption of&#13;
energy, meat or newsprint, or stocks of telephones, motor vehicles or&#13;
radios, on the other. These relationships are then used to predict the&#13;
per capita real income positions of countries for which only these&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
physical indicators are available. The theoretical underpinnings,&#13;
though not set out in the writings, would appear to rest on an Engel&#13;
curve-type hypothesis; that is, that there is an association between&#13;
the absorption of the good or service and per capita GDP.&#13;
This approach, which is usually associated with the name of&#13;
Beckerman, 15/ had not been thoroughly tested because of the lack of&#13;
reliable measures of per capita real incomes for a sufficiently large&#13;
number of countries. However, new data generated by the ICP provided&#13;
an opportunity for a re-examination of the physical indicators approach.&#13;
To be successful, the method must satisfy certain conditions:&#13;
the physical indicators used must be easily available in all the&#13;
countries; the relationship with real income must be amenable to easy&#13;
economic interpretation; and the algebraic function relating these&#13;
indicators to real income must be stable over time and space.&#13;
In this exercise, eight indicators for which consistent&#13;
data were available for a large number of countries were tried as&#13;
candidates: consumption of cement, steel, energy and newsprint, stocks&#13;
of road vehicles, telephones and radio receivers, and circulation of&#13;
letters. All variables were expressed as per capita indices with US =&#13;
100. Since these variables explained GDP and consumption equally well,&#13;
the focus was only on GDP. Data for a total of 56 observations were&#13;

assembled from various sources. 16/ After experimenting with several&#13;
functional forms, log-log equations of the following form were chosen&#13;
for obtaining the final results:&#13;
lnya+B1 lnx1 +B2 ln x2 + ... + B            ln x  + u       (4)&#13;
where y = index of real per capita income and the x's are the indices&#13;
of various physical indicators, with US = 100. This equation was&#13;
estimated with all possible combinations of the variables over all&#13;
available observations, both by separate years and by several yearly&#13;
samples pooled in various ways.&#13;
The physical indicators chosen were highly intercorrelated,&#13;
such that once three or four variables were included in the regression&#13;
equation, additional ones failed to produce significant coefficients&#13;
and/or raise R s. Three indicators, Letters (L), Steel (S), and&#13;
Energy (E) were found to perform consistently well in all the samples,&#13;
so much so that a combination of all the three produced the best&#13;
equation that could be estimated with physical indicators alone. It&#13;
-2&#13;
had the highest R in most of the recent samples, and the sets of&#13;
coefficients were found to be remarkably stable in the different&#13;

samples. The log-log equation estimated from the 1970-73 sample was as&#13;
follows:&#13;
ln y = 1.6253     +   0.2850   ln L  +   0.2340  in S&#13;

R  =  .9657                  SEE =   .1685&#13;
Physical indicators by themselves produced acceptably good&#13;
regressions, but the nominal index z alone generally produced better&#13;
results. Happily, a combination of one physical indicator, L, and the&#13;
nominal index, in a single equation improved the results obtained using&#13;
the variables individually.   The R  improved, and the sets of&#13;
coefficients were found to be homogeneous over the more recent samples&#13;
of 1967 to 1973. This equation in log-log form and estimated over the&#13;
1970-73 sample is:&#13;
ln y = 1.0073   +  0.8808  ln z  -   0.0755  (ln z)2&#13;

(5.05)&#13;
-2&#13;
R  = .9909              SEE  =   .0367&#13;
As noted, recently, KHS (1978b) reported success with the&#13;
variables openness (0) and price isolation (PI). Openness (0) is&#13;
measured by the average over the preceding several years of the ratio&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
of exports plus imports to GNP; price isolation (PI) is measured by the&#13;
mean squared deviation of a country's implicit GNP inflator from the&#13;
"world" implicit deflator.&#13;
These two variables generally improved the level of explana-&#13;
tion offered by the nominal index alone. However, a single physical&#13;
-2&#13;
indicator, L, was even better than PI and 0 in raising R . Moreover,&#13;
when PI and 0 and L were all used as independent variables in a quadra-&#13;
tic equation in nominal index, the R    was invariably raised in each&#13;
sample. The log-log equation estimated for the 1970-73 sample is:&#13;
ln y =  1.1618   +  1.0067  ln z  -   0.0862 (ln z)2&#13;
(9.06)      (13.9)            (-7.08)&#13;

(4.84)&#13;
-2&#13;
R  = .9945                SEE = .0675&#13;
The purpose of estimating these equations is to use them for&#13;
making predictions for observations outside the sample in both time and&#13;
space. To evaluate their relative performance, various preferred&#13;
equations estimated on the basis of the 1970 ICP data for 16 countries&#13;
were used to predict the real income values for the same set of countries&#13;
for 1973.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
In this test, the equation with PI and 0 performed better&#13;
than the ones without them. However, when regressions based upon the&#13;
10 Phase I ICP countries in 1970 were used to predict real income for&#13;
the additional six countries in Phase II, the equation including PI and&#13;
O performed worse than the ones excluding them.&#13;
Since all the preferred equations lacked predictive power&#13;
one way or another, the order of preference had to be based on the&#13;
coefficients of determination.&#13;
4.        REDUCED INFORMATION PROCEDURES WITH PUBLISHED DATA&#13;
The second alternative tested here was to use reduced&#13;
information methods based on published data. As noted, both the UN&#13;
data on post-adjustment allowances and the US Department of State&#13;
(USDS) data on costs of living abroad provide costs of living for only&#13;
a very special group of people: foreign officials stationed abroad for&#13;
a relatively short period of time who wish to maintain the level of&#13;
living they would have had if they lived in New York or Washington,&#13;
D.C. These people usually live in cities, patronize special outlets&#13;
and in general do not have the same pattern of consumption as that of&#13;
the indigenous population. It is therefore not appropriate, strictly&#13;
speaking, to use these data for PPP computations. However, these data&#13;
have high international comparability: they refer to a more or less&#13;
fixed basket of goods and services and to a homogeneous group of con-&#13;
sumers worldwide. Further, they are collected regularly for almost all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
countries of the world and are available for international product&#13;
comparisons free of cost. If the PPPs computed from these prices and&#13;
national expenditure weights were found either to match the ICP esti-&#13;
mates or to deviate from them with some consistent pattern, then it&#13;
might indeed be possible to derive an inexpensive system for computing&#13;
PPPs for most of the countries of the world.&#13;
To determine if this were possible, PPPs were computed from&#13;
these data sets and compared with those computed from corresponding ICP&#13;
data.&#13;
4.1       UN Post Adjustment Data&#13;
The original detailed price data collected for the UN post-&#13;
adjustment allowance computations were available for 1973 for nine 17/&#13;
of the sixteen countries included in the ICP Phase II report. The UN&#13;
data, which refer to capital cities, were carefully matched with ICP&#13;
category classifications. After correcting for time of reporting and&#13;
unit of measurement, individual item prices were expressed as price&#13;
relatives by dividing them by the corresponding US prices. Price&#13;
relatives for a category were calculated as a simple geometric mean of&#13;
the price relatives of items included in each category.&#13;
The first measure of differences between the UN and the ICP&#13;
price data was obtained at the category level in the form of a ratio&#13;
of the UN to ICP price relatives for each of the 66 categories for&#13;
which the UN data were available. The average of these ratios for&#13;
17/ The nine countries are Colombia, India, Iran, Japan, Kenya,&#13;
Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and the US.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
the countries in the sample, shown below in Table 1, ranged from .604&#13;
to 5.023, with an unweighted mean of 1.492. The category PPPs from the&#13;
UN data were in general higher than those from the ICP data, and the&#13;
magnitude of the difference had no clearcut pattern except that it&#13;
varied a great deal from country to country.&#13;
To see the differences between the results based upon UN and&#13;
ICP data at various levels of aggregations, binary comparisons were&#13;
made using per capita expenditure weights taken from the ICP. At the&#13;
highest level of aggregation, consumption, the UN PPPs were, on the&#13;
average, 20 percent higher than the ICP PPPs, suggesting that an&#13;
estimate of the ICP-type PPP can be obtained by computing it from the&#13;
UN data and reducing it by 20 percent (see Table 2). However, the&#13;
spread of the deviation between the low and the high estimates -- 2.3&#13;
percent for Japan and 50 percent for Iran -- was so large that such&#13;
estimates were unlikely to be acceptable except for the crudest calcu-&#13;
lations. There was no consistent pattern for the differences in the&#13;
consumption PPPs that could be explained by inter-country differences&#13;
in per capita income.&#13;
The results were generally worse at lower levels of aggrega-&#13;
tion. However, the block of UN data with the best chance of meeting'&#13;
the need for ICP-type price collection was Food, Beverage and Tobacco,&#13;
where the average of the ratio between UN to ICP PPP was 1.095, with a&#13;
coefficient of variation of 14 percent. On the other hand, in the area&#13;
of non-food consumption, where the savings in costs of collecting&#13;

prices would be substantial, the UN data hold little promise of being&#13;
useful in ICP-type PPP computations.&#13;
4.2.      US Department of State (USDS) Data&#13;
Data from the US Department of State, which were available&#13;
for all the 16 countries in the ICP sample, were similarly processed.&#13;
Individual items were assigned to appropriate ICP categories, and the&#13;
category PPPs were computed as simple geometric means of the item price&#13;
relatives included in the respective categories. The 64 categories for&#13;
which USDS data were available were further aggregated into binary&#13;
comparisons, with national expenditure weights available from the&#13;
ICP.&#13;
The results both at the category level and at various levels&#13;
of aggregation were compared with those from the ICP data. The conclu-&#13;
sions were very similar to those drawn from the UN data. The category&#13;
PPPs from USDS data were generally higher than those from the ICP data,&#13;
and the difference varied a great deal from one country to another&#13;
(Table 3). For the 16 countries in the sample, the average of the&#13;
ratios of the USDS to ICP PPPs for the highest level of aggregation--&#13;
consumption--was 1.37, with a coefficient of variation of 14 percent&#13;
(Table 4). Since the spread between the highest and the lowest esti-&#13;
mates was a large 61 percent, an estimate of PPPs based on the USDS&#13;
data would be far off the mark for many countries. As in the case of&#13;
UN data, there was no consistent pattern between the ratio of the USDS&#13;
to the ICP PPPs and per capita income. Further, unlike with the UN&#13;

case, no block of USDS data could be singled out as providing an&#13;
alternative to collecting prices for PPP computations.&#13;
5.        MECHANICAL OR AD HOC METHODS OF REDUCED INFORMATION&#13;
Since the prospects for using published data did not appear&#13;
bright, a decision was made to investigate whether the ICP results&#13;
could be replicated with a much smaller data base than is being cur-&#13;
rently used. The ICP price data base for the Phase I Report was to&#13;
include 1,300 price specifications classified into 153 categories,&#13;
which covered the entire GDP. However, no country in the ICP set&#13;
reported all 1,300 prices. In fact, an average of about 400 prices&#13;
were reported per country covering most of the 153 expenditure cate-&#13;
gories.&#13;
In order to determine how much of this information could be&#13;
dispensed with, without unduly affecting the final results, experiments&#13;
were made by arbitarily limiting, first, the number of categories, and&#13;
then, the number of items, and comparing the resultant PPPs with those&#13;
computed from the full set of data. The 1970 data underlying the ICP&#13;
Phase I report, which included 10 countries, 18/ were used for these&#13;
experiments.&#13;
5.1.      Deleting Categories&#13;
In order to see the effect of reducing the number of cate-&#13;
gories, three aggregates were chosen: Food, Beverage and Tobacco&#13;
18/ The ICP Phase I countries were Colombia, France, Germany, Hungary,&#13;
India, Italy, Japan, Kenya, UK and US.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(FBT), Non-Food Consumption, and Total Consumption. All the categories&#13;
in each of these aggregates were arranged in order of importance as&#13;
measured by their average expenditure weights in the three less deve-&#13;
loped countries (LDC) - Colombia, India and Kenya. These countries,&#13;
which constituted the developing countries among the Phase I countries,&#13;
were selected since it was anticipated that reduced information methods&#13;
would be needed most for developing countries.&#13;
The procedure was as follows. First, a quarter of the cate-&#13;
gories which were least important were eliminated from each list.&#13;
Then, successively, the least important half and two-thirds of these&#13;
categories were eliminated. The three reduced samples drawn from the&#13;
39 categories in FBT, therefore, retained 30, 20 and 13 categories,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
The item prices in the deleted categories were ignored, and&#13;
the expenditures were redistributed among the remaining categories in&#13;
the next higher aggregate. Binary PPPs were computed from the three&#13;
abbreviated samples. These were expressed as ratios of the PPPs&#13;
derived from the complete set of data covering all the 39 categories.&#13;
In order to see the effect of choosing the categories&#13;
according to expenditure weights of a rich country, the 39 categories&#13;
were reordered on the basis of expenditure weights of the richest&#13;
country in the sample, the US, and another set of three reduced samples&#13;
consisting of 30, 20 and 13 most important categories was chosen. The&#13;
results of binary comparisons from these samples also were expressed as&#13;
percentages of those derived from the total sample.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
The same procedure was followed with the other two aggregates --&#13;
Non-Food Consumption with 80 categories and Total Consumption with 113&#13;
categories.&#13;
Thus for each of these broad aggregates, PPPs were estimated&#13;
using the most important 75 percent, 50 percent and 33 percent of the&#13;
categories -- importance being defined in two ways, first on the basis&#13;
of importance in LDC's and then on the basis of importance in the US.&#13;
Not surprisingly, the errors of the abbreviated samples, as measured by&#13;
mean absolute deviations and maximum absolute deviations, were lower&#13;
when the samples were cut marginally, and they increased as greater&#13;
cuts were made. Table 5 summarizes the errors.&#13;
However, with each successive reduction in the sample size,&#13;
the PPP's on the average got smaller and smaller. The mean of the&#13;
ratios of PPPs derived from the truncated sample to the PPPs derived&#13;
from the total sample, instead of fluctuating around 1.0, progressively&#13;
declined as the sample size was reduced. For instance, in the case of&#13;
FBT, the averages of the ratios were 98, 95 and 90 for the three&#13;
successively smaller samples chosen on the basis of LDC expenditure&#13;
weights. While the averages were different when the samples were&#13;
chosen on the basis of US weights, they still invariably declined with&#13;
the sample size. This means that the more important a category is in&#13;
consumer budgets, the lower the category prices are in most countries&#13;
relative to the US. Therefore reducing the sample size on the basis of&#13;
expenditure weights will introduce a definite bias in the comparisons&#13;
and consequently should be avoided.&#13;

5.2.      Deleting Items&#13;
The objective of this experiment was to examine the effect&#13;
on comparisons when deletions were made at the item level, but all&#13;
categories were retained. To determine this, binary comparisons were&#13;
calculated with the number of items per category arbitrarily limited,&#13;
successively, to no more than five, four, three, two and finally one&#13;
item. Items least frequently priced in the sample of countries were&#13;
dropped first.&#13;
The results, expressed as before as ratios to the PPPs&#13;
derived from the full sample, were more encouraging. For Total Con-&#13;
sumption, limiting the number of items to 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 per cate-&#13;
gory reduced the overall size of the sample by 15, 21, 30, 43 and 70&#13;
percent respectively. The results presented in Table 6 show that it&#13;
seems hardly necessary to have more than five items per category&#13;
because the PPPs computed from no more than five items per category&#13;
virtually matched those computed from the full sample, with no country&#13;
deviating by more than one percent. With four items or less, the&#13;
maximum deviation was within 3 percent. Even when only one item per&#13;
category was retained, the sample size was reduced to 30 percent of the&#13;
full size, while the maximum any-country error was still no more than&#13;
10 percent. It seems, therefore, that attempts to reduce the sample&#13;
size by operating at the item level are likely to be productive.&#13;
Looking at the results of individual countries separately,&#13;
it seemed that for most of the countries, the PPPs increased as the&#13;
sample size was reduced. It was not apparent why this was so, but&#13;

comparisons with items selected on the basis of a weighted frequency&#13;
where the three EEC countries were counted as one did seem to reduce the&#13;
bias. Perhaps in a larger sample of countries which is more evenly&#13;
distributed between the rich and the poor, this kind of correction would&#13;
not be necessary.&#13;
The results from these ad hoc procedures seem to agree with&#13;
what intuition suggests: If it is necessary to operate on a reduced&#13;
information basis, it is better to spread the risk by deleting items&#13;
while retaining as many categories as possible than to pin hopes on a&#13;
few categories found to be important in consumer budgets.&#13;
6.        REDUCED INFORMATION:   REGRESSIONS APPROACH&#13;
The ad hoc procedures discussed above reveal that it is&#13;
better to reduce the sample size at the item level rather than at the&#13;
category level. However, when prices are deleted in an ad hoc manner&#13;
purely on the basis of frequency of response, the informational content&#13;
of each piece of data is not properly evaluated. The prices, for&#13;
instance, of beef, milk, hide or skin, all of which originate from the&#13;
same animal, may be related to each other in such a way as to make one&#13;
or more of these prices redundant for the purpose of computing PPPs.&#13;
Ruggles applied stepwise regression methods to the problems&#13;
of redundancy of items with respect to the US wholesale price index. 19/&#13;

Since items are related to each other by degrees of complementarity&#13;
and substitution in production as well as consumption, it is possible&#13;
that prices of certain items are so systematically related to the&#13;
appropriate PPPs that just a few of them may replicate the PPPs better&#13;
than a larger number.&#13;
An attempt was therefore made to identify, with the help of&#13;
multiple regression equations, the subsets of item price relatives that&#13;
best "explained" the PPPs derived from the full ICP procedures. The&#13;
hope was that in circumstances where the full ICP-type treatment is not&#13;
possible, pricing could be restricted to a relatively small number of&#13;
items and that the PPP estimates derived from regression equations&#13;
using these prices would still be reasonably accurate.&#13;
The ICP data for the 16 Phase II countries 20/ for 1973 were&#13;
used in this experiment. The subset of items that will produce the&#13;
best fit with an aggregate PPP will obviously depend on the level of&#13;
aggregation. The ICP Phase II data base has some 1,300 item specifi-&#13;
cations which are aggregated successively into 153 categories, 36&#13;
summary categories, 13 sub-aggregates, 3 main aggregates, and, finally,&#13;
the GDP. After carefully weighing the need for economy of effort and&#13;
for detail, six aggregates or sectors were chosen (the first three were&#13;
sub-aggregates of consumption): (1) Food, Beverage and Tobacco (FBT);&#13;
(2) Clothing, Furnishings and Other (CFO); (3) Rent, Medical Care,&#13;
Transportation, and Recreation and Education (RMTR); (4) Producer&#13;
20/ The Phase II countries are Belgium, Colombia, France, Germany,&#13;
Hungary, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Korea, Malaysia,&#13;
Netherlands, Philippines, UK and US (those underlined were&#13;
not in Phase I).&#13;

For each of the sectors, the vector of PPPs over the 15 countries (the&#13;
16th country, US, being the numeraire) was expressed in a log-log&#13;
equation as a function of many alternative sets of available item price&#13;
relatives. An initial step was to find the set of prices that achieved&#13;
either the highest coefficient of determination corrected for degrees&#13;
of freedom (R3 or the lowest residual error for any country, and&#13;
that contained prices that were available in all countries; it was&#13;
expected that when this sample of prices was inserted in the appro-&#13;
priate regression equation, it would provide a good estimate of the&#13;
sectoral PPP. The PPPs at higher levels of aggregation, e.g., GDP and&#13;
Consumption, could then be computed in a multilateral mode in, say, a&#13;
Geary-Khamis system of simultaneous equations.&#13;
It must be emphasized that what was being attempted was&#13;
-2&#13;
exploratory data analysis rather than statistical inference. The R&#13;
was used to describe a body of data rather than to confirm or reject&#13;
hypotheses. A collection of items that offers the best explanation for&#13;
a sectoral PPP in a particular sample of countries in a given year may&#13;
be expected to do the same in another set of countries at another point&#13;
of time. However, such an expectation is not based on any theoretical&#13;
construct so much as on a hope that the empirical relationship observed&#13;
in the present data set is stable over time.&#13;
6.1.      Methodological Issues&#13;
Before implementing the experiment, a series of methodological&#13;
and practical issues had to be resolved. One issue was what conversion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
factors to use in converting all the PPPs and price relatives, which&#13;
were expressed in local currency units, into a uniform currency dimen-&#13;
sion. Although overall PPPs were the ideal choice, the decision was&#13;
made to use exchange rates, since the goal was to predict the PPPs&#13;
themselves, and any operational scheme that required knowledge of the&#13;
PPPs before they were available could not be implemented. (Since&#13;
exchange rates are known to overstate PPP, thus giving biased results,&#13;
an alternative, quite restrictive procedure was tried in which the PPPs&#13;
were used in developing the equations, but not for making predictions.&#13;
The detailed procedure is discussed below.)&#13;
Another question was whether to suppress the constant term&#13;
and constrain the equation to make the sum of coefficients equal to&#13;
1.0. The reason for constraining the equation comes from the notion&#13;
that the PPPs may be regarded as weighted sums of the item price&#13;
relatives, with the regression coefficients supplying the weights.&#13;
However, since in the best sub-set regressions the constant terms are&#13;
often significantly different from zero and the sums of the coeffi-&#13;
cients are significantly different from 1.0, any constraint would lower&#13;
-2&#13;
R and raise the maximum residuals. On further reflection, it&#13;
became apparent that the PPP were not necessarily an average of the&#13;
prices of the selected items. For instance, if the price of carrots&#13;
were the most highly correlated with the fruits and vegetables PPP, but&#13;
carrot price relatives were 20 percent lower than the fruits and&#13;
vegetables PPP, the regression coefficient for carrots would not be 1.0&#13;
but in the neighborhood of 1.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
A decision was made to run the regression in log-log form&#13;
rather than in linear form purely on empirical grounds -- the fit with&#13;
log-log equations was consistently better.&#13;
The cumulative result of the various decisions was to run&#13;
regressions of the following form:&#13;
PpP            k           P  /P&#13;
ln (.I)    =  a +  S    B  ln ( iJ  i,us) + u           (8)&#13;
ER;           i=l    i         ER;&#13;
j = 1,2, ....,15                     i = 1,2,...,k&#13;
where&#13;
PPP.    =  Sectoral PPP of jth country;&#13;
ER      = Exchange rate:    units of jth&#13;
country's currency per US dollar;&#13;
Pi         Price of ith item in jth country&#13;
in local currency;&#13;
P          Price of ith item in US in dollars.&#13;
i ,us&#13;
The next question was how to determine the candidate variables&#13;
for these regressions -- whether the subset of items considered best&#13;
for explaining a sectoral PPP should be picked from all available&#13;
items, regardless of sector, or should be restricted to items within&#13;
the sector. The relations of complementarity and substitution need not&#13;
be restricted within a sector -- shoes or an item of clothing may be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
related to various diary products, and nails may enter in consumption&#13;
or producer durables as well as in construction. It was therefore&#13;
conceivable that item prices taken from outside the sector would produce&#13;
acceptable regressions.&#13;
For the most part, only items from the own sector were used&#13;
as candidates to explain the respective sectoral PPPs. However, where&#13;
own sectoral prices were not easily available or were inadequate in&#13;
number, such as in Producer Durables, Construction and Government,&#13;
items from outside the sector were used.&#13;
One particularly difficult problem was the question of missing&#13;
prices. In the category Total Consumption, out of a total of 1,048&#13;
specifications for prices, all countries except the US reported less&#13;
than 400. The overall price matrix had a great many holes. In fact, the&#13;
number of items for which all 16 countries reported a price was only&#13;
23. Clearly, a way had to be found to use the rest of the data.&#13;
One way was to extend the number of candidate items to a&#13;
reasonable number by estimating the missing prices. An attempt was&#13;
made to use as much of the available data as possible by entering a&#13;
synthetic correlation matrix rather than the raw data as input to the&#13;
regressions. The correlation matrix was computed from a synthesized&#13;
cross-product matrix, each element of which was formed by adding&#13;
together products for all observed prices and dividing the sum by the&#13;
number of products. Under this arrangement there were so many cells&#13;
without an observation that a decision was made to limit the number of&#13;
observations to those items which were priced in at least 12 of the 16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
countries and in at least five of the seven less developed countries in&#13;
the ICP Phase II sample.&#13;
Even though the synthesized cross-product matrix then had a&#13;
number in each cell, the correlation matrix was not positive definite&#13;
and, therefore, could not be used as an input to the regression pro-&#13;
grams. There was thus no alternative but to enter a full data matrix&#13;
in the program, which meant that the missing prices had to be esti-&#13;
mated. This was done by the Country-Product Dummy (CPD) method used by&#13;
Kravis, Kenessey, Heston and Summers, 21/ which uses all available&#13;
prices in a category and delivers a set of base-country-invariant price&#13;
relatives.&#13;
The central question at this point was how to select the best&#13;
subset of items from so many eligible candidates. Which price rela-&#13;
tives would be the best ones to enter as independent variables in the&#13;
regression equation? One way to decide would be to compute simple&#13;
Pearsonian correlation coefficients for all candidate item prices with&#13;
the particular dependent variable and then pick a set with the highest&#13;
coefficients. However, the item price relatives that are highly&#13;
correlated with the dependent variable are also highly correlated with&#13;
each other. To correct for this multicollinearity, coefficients of&#13;
partial correlation would have to have been used instead. But when the&#13;
candidates are numerous, the computation becomes so complicated that an&#13;
automatic procedure like stepwise regressions becomes attractive.&#13;
21/ A System, Chapter 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
In stepwise regression programs, the variable added sequen-&#13;
tially at each step is the one that makes the greatest reduction in the&#13;
error sum of squares. New variables are added until some given stop-&#13;
ping point is reached. It may be defined by the number of item prices&#13;
selected or by the required minimum F-value for the selected indepen-&#13;
dent variable. The most convenient feature of stepwise regression is&#13;
that even though the maximum number of variables that can be entered into&#13;
the regression is limited by the number of degrees of freedom, this selec-&#13;
tion can be made from a much larger set of candidate variables. The&#13;
disadvantage is that, once selected, a variable is never dropped, so&#13;
the particular subset chosen by stepwise regression may not necessarily&#13;
be the best subset.&#13;
The alternative to stepwise regressions is to run all&#13;
possible subset regressions in order to be able to pick the "best" one.&#13;
However, the number of all possible subsets increases exponentially&#13;
with the number of candidates [32767 with 15 candidates, 33.5 million&#13;
with 25 candidates]. It would have been impractical to compute them.&#13;
Fortunately, there is an algorithm called Leaps-and-Bounds 22/&#13;
which can deliver the best subset regression without computing all&#13;
possible subsets. Tests show that in every case where the subset&#13;
selected by Leaps-and-Bounds is different from the one selected by&#13;
stepwise regressions, the one selected by Leaps-and-Bounds has a higher&#13;
R and/or lower maximum residual error. The disadvantage with Leaps-&#13;
and-Bounds is that the number of item-price candidates it can consider&#13;
must be less than the number of observations.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Since in this experiment the number of candidate variables&#13;
was often considerably larger than the number of observations, the&#13;
selection of the best subset regression was performed in two stages;&#13;
first, stepwise regression was used to select a maximum of 14 variables&#13;
(the maximum number allowed by the degrees of freedom), and then these&#13;
were fed into Leaps-and-Bounds to make the final selections. The&#13;
regressions with the best subsets of different sizes delivered by&#13;
Leaps-and-Bounds were then evaluated for coefficients of determination&#13;
and maximum residuals.&#13;
6.2.      Regression Results&#13;
Consumption&#13;
The regression treatment of the various sectors will be out-&#13;
lined first, and then the use of regressions in prediction is discus-&#13;
sed. For the three consumption sectors, FBT, CFO and RMTR, the best&#13;
subset regressions were chosen following the scheme outlined above.&#13;
The candidate item prices were restricted to own sectors. The maximum&#13;
residuals for the selected regressions were 1.2 percent for FBT, -0.2&#13;
percent for CFO and 1.9 percent for RMTR. A total of 33 item prices&#13;
was selected. This must be regarded as truly a reduced information&#13;
sample because the full ICP treatment currently requires at least 200&#13;
prices for consumption comparisons. The selected items along with&#13;
their ICP specifications codes are listed in Tables 7, 8 and 9.&#13;

Producer Durables&#13;
The procedure outlined above could not be followed for the&#13;
three non-consumption sectors: Producers' Durables (PD), Construc-&#13;
tion (CONSTR) and Government (GOVT). The ICP comparisons for PD are&#13;
made by painstakingly matching specifications and obtaining special&#13;
pricing for virtually each country separately. In order to use use&#13;
reduced information procedure to select a sample of these products,&#13;
substantial expertise and expense would still be needed to collect the&#13;
prices. Building on the assumption that the prices for producer&#13;
durables prevailing in an economy are not independent of the prices in&#13;
other sectors, an attempt was made to explain the Producer Durables PPP&#13;
with the help of items picked from certain "plausible" areas of con-&#13;
sumption such as consumer durables, fuel, transportation, materials and&#13;
various kinds of skilled and unskilled labor.&#13;
The selected regression included 10 item prices and had a&#13;
maximum any-country residual error of -2.8 percent. The selected&#13;
regression has been presented in Table 10.&#13;
Construction&#13;
The problem of missing observations in construction was so&#13;
serious (only seven items were priced in 12 or more countries) that&#13;
all the 106 specifications were first consolidated into 16 "sensible"&#13;
groups in order to assure at least one price from every country for&#13;
each of the consolidated specifications. After consolidation, the&#13;
price tableau still had a few missing cells, which were estimated by&#13;
CPD.&#13;

The search for the best subset regression -- conducted the&#13;
same way as in consumption -- yielded 10 specifications. However,&#13;
based on experience with price collection in construction items, to&#13;
collect all these prices would still have been expensive. Three alterna-&#13;
tives were tried. The first was to find one or two easily defined and&#13;
generally available construction specifications and to "explain" the&#13;
construction PPP by the prices of these specifications. The second was&#13;
to use a shortcut to explain the construction PPP with the help of per&#13;
capita nominal GDP. The third was to do the same thing as was done for&#13;
producers' durables -- i.e., "explain" construction PPP by a set of&#13;
"plausible" consumption and labor items.&#13;
None of these alternatives had intuitive appeal, but the&#13;
third was found to do an adequate job. A regression with a set of 10&#13;
specifications chosen from these "plausible" items was selected for&#13;
predicting the construction PPP. This regression is presented in Table&#13;
11.&#13;
Government&#13;
The problem of missing prices was not serious in Govenment,&#13;
so that, using a sequence of stepwise regressions and Leaps-and Bounds,&#13;
an equation with 11 of the government item prices was quickly esta-&#13;
blished. However, this equation was not usable for predictions because&#13;
ICP's experience showed that government prices were hard to get and&#13;
caused delays in completing the work. Therefore, as in Producer&#13;
Durables and Construction, the Government PPP also was predicted using&#13;
&#13;

Table 12.&#13;
Summary&#13;
The six sectoral equations required a total of 46 item&#13;
prices (some of the items were used in more than one sector). These&#13;
items and the associated regressions constituted the core of the&#13;
reduced information procedure.   The R  of these regressions were&#13;
mostly above .99, and the maximum residuals for any country were no more&#13;
than 3.8 percent. Consequently, this procedure replicated the 1973 com-&#13;
parisons almost perfectly. However, to see how it would perform for another&#13;
set of countries at another point in time, it was used to predict in&#13;
advance the results for the ICP Phase III countries for the year 1975.&#13;
6.3.      Prediction&#13;
How should this scheme be used to predict PPPs in a country&#13;
for which the full ICP type-treatment was not possible? There were&#13;
three alternatives: the first was to use just the specification prices&#13;
and the algebraic equations estimated from the 1973 sample. Each new&#13;
country, threfore, would need to collect prices for these and only&#13;
these specifications.&#13;
This alternative was used to predict the Phase III results&#13;
presented here. However, most countries routinely collect prices for&#13;
various national publications such as the Consumer Price Index.&#13;
Therefore, more than 46 prices would normally be available for a new&#13;
country without any additional effort, and it would be inefficient to&#13;
&#13;

ignore this additional information. In those circumstances, a second&#13;
alternatJve may be tried. In addition to making an estimate using&#13;
these regressions, a second estimate may be made as a weighted average&#13;
of the remaining price relatives, and the final prediction could be&#13;
taken as an average of this and the 46-item prediction.&#13;
A final alternative would involve using a new set of regres-&#13;
sions, tailor-made for each situation. The 46 specifications would be&#13;
considered minimal, and countries would be encouraged to supply any&#13;
additional prices. Then, using the latest ICP-type benchmark data, new&#13;
subset regressions, estimated on the basis of all available prices as&#13;
candidates, would then be used to estimate the new country's PPPs.&#13;
6.4.      PPP vs. Exchange Rate as Conversion Factors&#13;
So far, the problem of using exchange rates as conversion&#13;
factors instead of the PPPs has been ignored. The use of PPPs (at the&#13;
GDP level) in place of exchange rates to convert the price relatives&#13;
and sectoral PPPs would make the price relatives of the poorer countries&#13;
in the sample relatively higher and would, conceivably, lead to the&#13;
selection of a separate set of items which might be structurally more&#13;
appropriate. Granting that this is possible, the problem is how to&#13;
employ the scheme for the purpose of prediction.&#13;
It is possible to use the following formulation which will&#13;
employ the PPPs as conversion factors for the purpose of estimating the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
regressions, but which will not require them for the purpose of predic-&#13;
tion. Thus the equation could be estimated as&#13;
ppps        k        P   /P&#13;
ln     i   =  S Bi ln( ii    i, us]               (9)&#13;
pppg.     i=l            pppg.&#13;
where the superscripts s and g stand for sector and GDP respectively,&#13;
and all other symbols mean the same as before. From this, the PPPs;&#13;
can be estimated as follows:&#13;
k&#13;
pppsj    S Bi ln (Pi,; /pi,us)                   (10)&#13;
if&#13;
k&#13;
S Bi = 1.0                                       (11)&#13;
i=l&#13;
That is, not only should the constant term be suppressed, but the sum&#13;
of coefficients must also be constrained to equal 1.0. Since the&#13;
equation is estimated irrespective of the significance of the coeffi-&#13;
cients, the maximum residual errors are bound to increase.&#13;
The collection of item prices chosen on the basis of PPP&#13;
converted values may be useful in yet another way: though the search&#13;
procedure was conducted using PPP converted values, the regression-&#13;
equations to be used for prediction could be estimated on the basis of&#13;
exchange rate conversions. In this way the collection of items might&#13;
also be "proper" structurally. However, the equations might not be the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

best statistically, presenting a problem of choice: whether to use only&#13;
exchange rates and risk having a structurally unsound set of predic-&#13;
tors, or whether to select the right set of predictors but use them in&#13;
a way that increases the residual errors.&#13;
Three alternative predictions were made (a) using exchange&#13;
rate converted values both to select the variables and to make predic-&#13;
tions, (b) using PPP converted values to select the variables but&#13;
reestimating the equation so as to eliminate the need for conversion&#13;
factors for making the predictions, and finally (c) using the PPP&#13;
converted values to select the variables, but reestimating the predic-&#13;
ting equation with values converted by exchange rates.&#13;
In order to help choose between the alternatives, Table 13&#13;
summarizes the maximum residual errors for the six sectors under each&#13;
of these alternatives. The results under alternative (a) (column 1)&#13;
must be the most highly regarded. The reduced information sample&#13;
presented in Tables 7 through 12 has been chosen following this alter-&#13;
native.&#13;

7.        PREDICTIONS OF REAL GDP PER CAPITA FOR 1975 FOR PHASE III&#13;
COUNTRIES AND CONCLUDING REMARKS&#13;
The work of the ICP Phase III now in progress will provide an&#13;
opportunity to test the various shortcut and reduced information schemes&#13;
developed here. In order to see how these formulae and schemes are&#13;
likely to perform, they have been used to make alternative predictions&#13;
of relative levels of per capita real GDP for 1975 for some of the new&#13;
countries in Phase III of the ICP. Table 14 presents four different sets&#13;
of predictions, three using shortcut formulae and a fourth that uses the&#13;
PPPs estimated through reduced information procedures. The index of GDP&#13;
per capita converted by exchange rates is also shown in the table. A&#13;
comparison of these predictions with the actual ICP numbers which will&#13;
soon be available will give clues as to which of the methods, if any, is&#13;
likely to provide a viable alternative to a full ICP-type treatment.&#13;
Compared with the shortcut predictions, the results of reduced&#13;
information prediction appear to fluctuate rather widely from country to&#13;
country. Thus Austria, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain, and possibly also&#13;
Pakistan appear to be clearly out of line. This is probably because of&#13;
the tentative nature of some of the ICP Phase III prices used in these&#13;
predictions. At this stage in the collection of data for Phase III,&#13;
the price tableau shows extensive holes. The estimates of sectoral PPPs&#13;
made through the Country-Product Dummy (CPD) method 23/ are based on a&#13;
far smaller number of prices than will be available for the final ICP&#13;
23/ See A System, Chapter 5, for a description of CPD.&#13;

exercise. An appropriate way of comparing the reduced information esti-&#13;
mates with the final ICP results would be to re-estimate these reduced&#13;
information predictions using the same actual prices as are ultimately&#13;
used by the ICP.&#13;
The shortcut methods presented here are likely to be mis-&#13;
trusted in many quarters because they are based on average relationships&#13;
observed in a certain set of countries over a certain period of time and&#13;
applied to other countries at different times. Some of these other&#13;
countries may not accept the results if the results do not suit their&#13;
purpose. The assumption of a stable relationship across time and space&#13;
may be reasonable for some purposes, but not for others.&#13;
Reduced information methods, on the other hand, based as they&#13;
are on actual observations taken from the relevant countries and times&#13;
concerned, are likely to be better received. PPPs based upon smaller&#13;
sets of item prices sampled from all categories will be regarded as more&#13;
attractive than those based upon shortcut procedures, even if the short-&#13;
cuts happen to perform better for the ICP Phase III countries.&#13;
For some countries, such as the centrally planned ones, where&#13;
viable price information may not be available, shortcuts may be the only&#13;
hope.&#13;
When the new observations are available for the ICP Phase III&#13;
study, it may be possible to refine both shortcuts and reduced informa-&#13;
tion procedures. Under the current state of knowledge, however, if PPP&#13;
converted values are to replace the exchange rate converted values on&#13;
an international scale such as in the World Bank Atlas, the use of both&#13;
shortcuts and reduced information procedures will be inevitable.&#13;

            Approaches to purchasing power parity and
            real product comparisons using shortcuts and reduced information
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The present work investigates various
            procedures for estimating purchasing power parities (PPPs),
            which are more economical in their requirements. Two
            approaches are pursued here: (1) a short-cut approach which
            attempts to exploit structual relationships between real
            national income in a country and associated monetary and/or
            non-monetary indicators; and (2) a reduced information
            approach in which PPPs are estimated on the basis of small
            subsets of price data which can be collected cheaply in the
            countries being compared. Shortcuts based on a monetary
            indicator, nominal income, and supplemented with other
            financial and physical indicator variables, provide a basis
            for estimating PPPs which is a substantial improvement over
            the use of exchange rates. Furthermore, a systematic
            experimentation with a large data base collected for
            international comparisons suggests that a significant
            reduction in the number of prices collected in each country
            could be carried out without serious degradation of quality
            of PPP estimates.
