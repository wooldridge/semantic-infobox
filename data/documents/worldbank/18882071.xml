&amp;#12;I.            Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
India is home to more than 370 million people in urban           public-private partnerships (PPPs) in water supply opera-&#13;
areas. Historically, almost all water supply provision has       tions in the early 1990s, following economic liberaliza-&#13;
been managed by the public sector through municipal or           tion. Many of these early projects focused on bulk water&#13;
state-level departments or parastatals.                          augmentation, with expectations of significant private&#13;
                                                                 investment. Most failed because of poor enabling frame-&#13;
Benchmarking initiatives show that coverage through piped        works for private investment, poor project preparation,&#13;
water supply ranges between 55 percent and 89 percent in         weak financial strength of project proponents, and opposi-&#13;
urban areas. Per capita availability is fairly high, at 90 to    tion to private sector participation.&#13;
120 liters per day, but no city yet offers continuous water&#13;
supply. Daily supply averages four hours, with many cities       In the first half of the 2000s, a shift in focus toward distri-&#13;
alternating supply every other day.                              bution services took place, although projects were still&#13;
                                                                 handicapped by opposition to private sector involvement&#13;
Service efficiency is weak, which means utilities have low       in water supply services. The management contract model&#13;
cost recovery, further exacerbated by low tariffs that have      was explored, and governments started providing funding&#13;
little relation to operating costs. Only about 20 percent of     to meet a significant part of the investment needs while the&#13;
connections are metered, and nonrevenue waterâ&#128;&#148;water for          private sector focused on creating efficiencies.&#13;
which no revenues are collectedâ&#128;&#148;averages over 40 percent&#13;
in most cities.                                                  By 2005, cities were creating a mix of PPP arrangements,&#13;
                                                                 including concession agreements, management contracts,&#13;
These challenges occur in a context of weak management           and build-own-transfer (BOT) projects. A review of the&#13;
systems and little data on existing assets, which makes it       achievements of Indian water PPPs, drawing upon a study&#13;
difficult to assess investment needs and time lines to improve   in 2011,1 reveals the following: the shift in focus to service&#13;
service levels and operational efficiencies. While investment    delivery; the increasing willingness of cities to explore and&#13;
requirements are likely to be significant, it is recognized      design solutions that suit their needs; the recognition that&#13;
that investments alone will not be effective unless the coun-    PPPs may be pursued for efficiency gains, in addition to&#13;
try simultaneously addresses related issues such as complex      private financing; the recognition and handling of sensi-&#13;
and fragmented institutions with little accountability; lack     tivities around tariff issues; the success in attracting interest&#13;
of capacity to run utilities efficiently and meet performance    from a cross section of domestic and international opera-&#13;
standards; weak commercial orientation; interference in          tors; the embedding of competitive selection processes;&#13;
utility operations by external entities; and the absence of      and an increased ownership demonstrated by cities toward&#13;
a regulatory framework focused on customer service and           PPPs. The number of projects achieving financial closure&#13;
financial sustainability.                                        has also increased significantly: of the 15 projects awarded&#13;
                                                                 between 2005 and 2011, 10 involved private finance and&#13;
Against this sector backdrop, some cities began to attempt       eight achieved financial closure.&#13;

 Local political opposition started as soon as the contract was                      Subsequent to the national elections, asset transfer from&#13;

 able meters did not meet the specifications, and so the oper-                       were completed; and the take-over of assets by the operator&#13;
 ator had to import meters. Consumers felt that they were                            was effected from April 1, 2010. The period for satisfying&#13;
 being forced to incur high costs for imported meters (even                          the Conditions Precedent is deemed to have commenced at&#13;
 though the costs were predetermined during bidding) and                             this time. However, the operator still maintained that MJP&#13;
 were unable to verify actual costs. The opposition to meters                        had not completed preparatory activities as agreed, includ-&#13;
 was further fuelled by the fact that existing system deficien-                      ing major repair works in the system and rehabilitation of&#13;
 cies did not permit for even one hour of daily supply to all                        the bulk water supply system, as proposed by the operator;&#13;
 households. This was seized upon by opponents to argue                              transfer of MJP employees; and updating of the customer&#13;
 that the arrangement was prioritizing commercial aspects                            database. MJP maintained a stand that no technical inputs&#13;
 over service delivery.                                                              were received from the operator for rectification and effi-&#13;

 As the opposition hardened, the Latur Water Supply&#13;
 Opposition Committee was formed. Impending elections                                The Project Continues to Face Opposition&#13;

Rationale for a PPP: Continuous Water Supply                                        There were prolonged discussions on whether the opera-&#13;

Program to rehabilitate its distribution assets. At this time,                      (therefore taking a price risk) or only a project management&#13;
the city did not envisage continuous water supply. The                              responsibility (receiving a fee for supervising execution&#13;
JNNURM approved the grant in 2006, but it was condi-                                through third party contractors). A combination of fixed&#13;
tional on the city achieving continuous water supply. This                          construction payments for rehabilitation and a manage-&#13;

achieve continuous water supply. The success of KUWASIP                             to the operator.&#13;
also strengthened the case for partnering with the private&#13;
sector.                                                                             Technical Preparation&#13;

            Running water in India's cities : a
            review of five recent public-private partnership initiatives
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            India is home to more than 370 million
            people in urban areas. Historically, almost all water supply
            provision has been managed by the public sector through
            municipal or state-level departments or parastatals.
            Benchmarking initiatives show that coverage through piped
            water supply ranges between 55 percent and 89 percent in
            urban areas. Per capita availability is fairly high, at 90
            to 120 liters per day, but no city yet offers continuous
            water supply. Daily supply averages four hours, with many
            cities alternating supply every other day. These challenges
            occur in a context of weak management systems and little
            data on existing assets, which makes it difficult to assess
            investment needs and time lines to improve service levels
            and operational efficiencies. While investment requirements
            are likely to be significant, it is recognized that
            investments alone will not be effective unless the country
            simultaneously addresses related issues such as complex and
            fragmented institutions with little accountability; lack of
            capacity to run utilities efficiently and meet performance
            standards; weak commercial orientation; interference in
            utility operations by external entities; and the absence of
            a regulatory framework focused on customer service and
            financial sustainability. In response to social issues, all
            contracts have proactively provided for service delivery
            options to consumers as well as tariff concessions (bulk
            supply to poor neighborhoods, fortnightly payment options,
            special tariff for group connections, and so forth). It will
            also be useful to explicitly state the subsidy that the city
            will bear for connecting poor consumers to the network.
            Explicit arrangements in the contract will allay
            apprehensions of urban poor as well as encourage the
            operator to connect the poor.
