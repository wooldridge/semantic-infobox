Ample supplies and weak demand, especially for                        third quarter of 2015, down more than a third&#13;
industrial commodities, contributed to the continued                  from their early-2011 high. Abundant supply and&#13;

higher Iranian oil exports in 2016. Coal and                          Downside risks to the energy price forecast include&#13;
natural gas prices declined marginally on continued                   higher-than-expected production from OPEC&#13;
weak demand and excess supply. Oil consumption                        producers and continuing falling costs of the U.S.&#13;
growth has risen this year, in part due to lower                      shale oil industry. Slowing demand and high stocks&#13;
prices. Oil supply continues to outpace demand,                       would further weigh on oil prices. Upside risks&#13;
although global production is plateauing and year-                    include accelerating declines in shale output,&#13;
on-year growth is diminishing. U.S. oil production                    delayed implementation of the Iran agreement,&#13;

     What does it mean for commodity markets?&#13;
El NiÃ±o often adversely affects agricultural production in                               Australia, while there is modest impact in the North-&#13;
the Southern Hemisphere, especially countries in Latin                                   ern Hemisphere.&#13;

forecasts suggests that the current El NiÃ±o episode could be                             months. Typically, they develop during April-June and&#13;
one of the strongest on record. However, its impact on                                   reach maximum strength during December-February&#13;

The El NiÃ±o episode currently under way could be                                         According to most forecasting models, the current El&#13;

     below the -0.5 anomaly for La NiÃ±a events. The threshold is further broken down into Weak (with a 0.5 to 0.9 SST anomaly), Moderate (1.0 to 1.4), Strong (1.5 to 1.9) and&#13;
     Very Strong (â&#137;¥ 2.0) events. An event to be categorized in any of the above categories it must have equaled or exceeded the threshold for at least three consecutive 3-month&#13;

         in North America, but stocks in other regions are rela-&#13;
         tively high as well. Stocks of refined products in North&#13;
         America are above their five-year average but relatively&#13;
         low elsewhere. In the fourth quarter, oil demand by&#13;
         refineries is expected to pick up after they exit autumn&#13;
         maintenance, which is expected to draw on inventories&#13;
         during fall/winter months. Outside the OECD, China&#13;
         has been importing crude above its consumption&#13;
         needs by more than 0.1 mb/d, some of which has&#13;
         likely been placed in its growing strategic reserve. In-&#13;
         creasing storage capacity is expected to result in strate-&#13;

         Crude oil prices are projected to average $52/bbl in&#13;
         2015, a drop of 46 percent from last year. U.S. crude&#13;
         oil production is expected to continue declining mod-&#13;
         erately into next year and will help to reduce the sur-&#13;
         plus. There is uncertainty as to how quickly the market&#13;
         will rebalance, and will depend on the pace of both&#13;
         demand and supply. Oil prices are expected to fall&#13;
         slightly in 2016, averaging $51/bbl, assuming a steady&#13;
         return to balance throughout the year.&#13;

     was reached in July 2015 and is expected to be                           2015). Provisions are in place to â&#128;&#156;snap-backâ&#128;&#157;&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;T  he ï¬&#129;ve-year decline in most commodity prices continued&#13;
in the third quarter of 2015 due to ample supplies and weak&#13;
demand. The decline was led by energy prices, which dropped&#13;
17 percent, partly on expectations of increased future exports&#13;
by Iran. A Special Focus section concludes that the impact&#13;
of an unusually strong El NiÃ±o weather episode this year is&#13;
unlikely to cause a spike in global agricultural commodity&#13;
prices, although local disruptions are possible. Separately,&#13;
this edition documents that Iran could ramp up oil production&#13;
following the lifting of sanctions and, over the long-term,&#13;
export a signiï¬&#129;cant volume of oil and natural gas if the&#13;
country attracts the necessary investment and technology to&#13;
leverage its substantial reserves.&#13;

            Commodity markets outlook : understanding
            El Nino
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Ample supplies and weak demand,
            especially for industrial commodities, contributed to the
            continued slide in most commodity prices in the third
            quarter of 2015. Annual price forecasts are revised down for
            2015 and 2016. Only a modest recovery is expected in 2016.
            This issue briefly analyzes the implications of the ongoing
            El Nino episode and the recent nuclear agreement with Iran
            for agricultural and energy markets, respectively. Although
            El Nino can be the strongest on record, its impact is likely
            to be predominantly local rather than global because world
            commodity markets are currently well-supplied and spillovers
            from local markets to global prices are typically weak.
            Following Iran’s nuclear agreement, the country’s 40 million
            barrels in floating storage can be made available almost
            immediately upon sanctions being lifted; and, within a few
            months, Iran can increase its crude oil production toward
            pre-sanctions levels. The impact of Iranian exports on
            global oil and natural gas markets can be large over the
            longer term provided that Iran attracts the necessary
            foreign investment and technology to extract its substantial reserves.
