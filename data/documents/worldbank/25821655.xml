EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
Technological adoption and innovation will play a crucial role in delivering the&#13;
goals laid out in the Government of Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s Growth Transformation Plan&#13;
(GTP). Innovation is now widely recognized as a major engine for productivity&#13;
growth. â&#128;&#156;Innovation implies technologies or policies that are new to a given country&#13;
context or society. They are not necessarily new in absolute terms but can be&#13;
technologies and practices that are being diffused or absorbed in that society or&#13;
economy1.â&#128;&#157;This is particularly important for Ethiopia that is aiming to move up the&#13;
domestic value chain and move up the quality ladder. The role of government in&#13;
fostering innovation is crucial. In addition to facilitation and enhancing enabling&#13;
environment, the state may have to play a more active role to address market failures&#13;
and coordination across multiple stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
While the world is becoming increasingly competitive, it is important for many&#13;
businesses to be innovative by challenging themselves to come up with new and&#13;
different ways of doing things. Innovation is widely regarded as the important&#13;
element that enables firms to thrive in today's global business environment.&#13;
However, empirical evidence shows that there is a low level technological&#13;
innovativeness amongst Ethiopian firms.2&#13;
&#13;
Innovation also plays an important role in the GTP which seeks to transform of&#13;
the Ethiopian economy from a predominantly agrarian to an industrialized&#13;
economy. Ethiopia has not been able to foster and accelerate structural&#13;
transformation as envisioned in the GTP. In fact, Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s past high growth decade&#13;
has been fueled by large services and agricultural sectors. These two sectors are very&#13;
important to the economy, together accounting for almost 90 percent of GDP between&#13;
2003/04 and 2013/14. At the same time the manufacturing share in GDP is at just&#13;
above 4.1 percent of GDP3.&#13;
&#13;
The Government plays a pivotal role in facilitating inclusive innovation as well.&#13;
The large size of the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) calls for innovative ways to ensure&#13;
that this population has access to basic services such as health and education. 66&#13;
percent of the population comprises the BoP in Ethiopia subsisting on less than US$&#13;
2 a day. â&#128;&#156;Inclusive innovation4â&#128;&#157; is any innovation that leads to affordable access of&#13;

&amp;#12;    Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                               3&#13;

&#13;
quality goods and services creating livelihood opportunities for the excluded&#13;
population, primarily at the base of the pyramid and on a long term sustainable basis&#13;
with a significant outreach. It seeks to provide better access to essential goods and&#13;
services with affordable prices, thereby improving quality of life, and enhancing&#13;
economic empowerment of the excluded populations, primarily at the BoP.&#13;
&#13;
With this in mind, this study seeks: (i) to empirically analyze the extent of&#13;
innovative activities that formal firms are undertaking in Ethiopia using the World&#13;
Bank Enterprise Survey data; (ii) to conduct a review of the existing innovation&#13;
landscape; and (iii) to identify challenges and opportunities to foster innovations at&#13;
the base of the pyramid (BoP) in Ethiopia. By drawing on lessons from ongoing&#13;
innovation-focused interventions around the world, this study aims to provide&#13;
concrete policy recommendations to create an enabling environment for private&#13;
firms to undertake innovative activities to increase productivity, as well as to provide&#13;
innovative solutions to help alleviate poverty and facilitate more equitable growth in&#13;
the economy.&#13;
&#13;
Innovation Performance in Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s innovation performance stifles its overall competitiveness. According&#13;
to the World Economic Forumâ&#128;&#153;s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), Ethiopia ranks&#13;
109th out of 140 countries with a score of 3.7 out of 7.0 in the 2015-16 report. While&#13;
the overall score of innovation indicators increased 0.5 points in the past six years&#13;
(3.2 in 2015-16 from 2.7 in 2009-10), Ethiopia still lags behind in global&#13;
benchmarking on key innovation indicators and has room for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
Increase in the R&amp;D budget was a result of the increased headcount of R&amp;D&#13;
personnel5 and not researchers. From 2010 to 2013, Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s spending on&#13;
R&amp;D, increased from 931.3 million ETB to 5,242.6 million ETB. As such, the share of&#13;
R&amp;D spending as a share of GDP has increased from 0.24 percent to 0.61 percent.&#13;
However, a large share of this increase is on account of the increased headcount of&#13;
R&amp;D personnel. The number of R&amp;D personnel in the country has increased to 18,435&#13;
in 2013 from 13,095 in 2010, which is approximately a 41 percent increase.&#13;
Meanwhile, the percentage of the number of researchers6 that increased during the&#13;
same period was about 13 percent (from 7,283 to 8,218). This implies that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5 R&amp;D Personnel are all persons employed directly on R&amp;D (researchers, technicians and equivalent staff), as well&#13;
as those providing direct services such as R&amp;D managers, administrators, and clerical staff.&#13;
6 Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes,&#13;
&#13;
methods and systems and also in the management of the projects concerned (UNESCO Institute for Statistics)&#13;
&amp;#12;    Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                               4&#13;
    in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
majority of the increase of R&amp;D personnel was on account of the increase of personnel&#13;
other than researchers.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, business sector spending on R&amp;D has sharply declined.&#13;
Contrary to higher education and government institutions, the R&amp;D spending by&#13;
business sector has decreased from 144.6 million ETB to 61.5 million ETB during the&#13;
same period, which accounts for only 1.2 percent of the total R&amp;D spending in 2013.&#13;
Given increased global competition, success of Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s industrial sector depends&#13;
on the firmsâ&#128;&#153; ability to innovate7.&#13;
&#13;
Innovation has a positive correlation to firm performance in Ethiopia. This&#13;
study explores the patterns of innovation levels and attempts to establish innovation&#13;
correlates in Ethiopia using data from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Enterprise Survey (ES)8.&#13;
Innovation is captured by product, process, marketing and organizational changes&#13;
and improvements. Firms that have introduced product or process innovations in&#13;
Ethiopia show higher sales growth than those that have not. Similarly, process&#13;
innovation and spending on R&amp;D appear to be triggers for employment creation in&#13;
Ethiopia, and finally, the analysis shows that process innovation and spending on&#13;
R&amp;D enhance labor productivity.&#13;
&#13;
Firm level innovation compares less favorably to other comparator countries.&#13;
About a third of the surveyed firms report having introduced new products or having&#13;
improved their production or business processes (Figure A). However, the country&#13;
performs unfavorably vis-Ã -vis the selected comparators, as the share of firms that&#13;
innovate in Ethiopia is about half of the share of the firms that do so in both China and&#13;
Kenya.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Larger firms undertake a disproportionately large share of innovative activity&#13;
in Ethiopia. Among large firms, the share of firms who do innovate is larger,&#13;
especially in Ethiopia where the figure reaches just under 70 percent. In line with this,&#13;
smaller firms are less likely to spend in research and development, a fact that is&#13;
particularly noticeable in Ethiopia once again, vis-Ã -vis similar countries. Smaller&#13;
firms in Ethiopia report a lower rate of product or process innovation than similar&#13;
firms in China and low income countries and almost half the corresponding figure for&#13;
Kenya. Also, innovation varies depending on certain firm characteristics, such as the&#13;
sector in which the firm operates.&#13;
&#13;
Ethiopian manufacturing firms are more likely to innovate than service firms&#13;
are. While this pattern is not specific to Ethiopia, the gap is substantially larger in&#13;
Ethiopia than in the comparator countries. This could be due to the fact that services&#13;
firms are more heterogeneous than manufacturing firms, pulling the average for the&#13;
services sector firmsâ&#128;&#153; down. Another possible explanation is that services firms tend&#13;
to be smaller than manufacturing firms. Further, firms in the textile and garment, and&#13;
in the food sectors seem to have a higher prevalence of product and process&#13;
innovation than firms in other sectors. This is also consistent with the finding that&#13;
Ethiopian exports of textiles and apparel goods increased from 0.1% to 3.3 % of total&#13;
goods exported between the period 1997 â&#128;&#147; 2013.&#13;
&#13;
Access to credit and the quality of the human capital, and the firmâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
commitment to invest in developing it, are also important for innovation. The&#13;
analysis shows that limited access to credit poses a significant barrier to product&#13;
innovation in Ethiopia. Firms that are credit constrained are about 14 percentage&#13;
points less likely to undertake product innovation than are non-credit constrained&#13;
ones, everything else remaining equal. The analyses also shows that providing&#13;
training to employees and allowing employeesâ&#128;&#153; time to experiment are both factors&#13;

that positively correlate with the probability to engage in product innovation. These&#13;
findings corroborate the importance of human capital for innovation.&#13;
&#13;
Role of Government&#13;
&#13;
The Government plays an essential role in ensuring entrepreneurs, financial&#13;
institutions, academia and industry create wealth for the society through&#13;
innovation. By providing a conducive regulatory and policy environment, promoting&#13;
greater competition through openness to trade and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)&#13;
and promoting an education system that is responsive to industry needs, the&#13;
government plays a central role in promoting innovation. The State will play a&#13;
particularly important role in increasing innovation for the BoP before the private&#13;
sector is able to build a profitable and scalable business solution. Hence, the&#13;
successful implementation of the STI policy would be one of the most critical factors&#13;
to ensure that innovative activity is undertaken in the economy and there are returns&#13;
to firms on these innovation investments in terms of increased firm level&#13;
productivity.&#13;
&#13;
The Government of Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to establish an enabling environment for&#13;
innovation have been initiated more than two decades ago, but its weak&#13;
implementation has deterred its effective establishment. The national Science&#13;
and Technology (S&amp;T) policy of the country was originally adopted by the transitional&#13;
Government of Ethiopia in 1993 to boost innovation activities for economic&#13;
development through the application of science and technology9. However, it was not&#13;
followed up by detailed implementation of strategies and programs aimed at&#13;
achieving the envisaged policy objectives. Recognizing the important role and the&#13;
urgent need for innovation to increase the countryâ&#128;&#153;s sustainable development,&#13;
Ethiopia adopted a new Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy in February&#13;
201210. In addition, the Government has developed the STI policy implementation&#13;
strategy which supports the implementation of strategies envisioned in the GTP.&#13;
&#13;
The implementation of the STI policy is crucial to facilitate linkages between&#13;
different actors and institutions involved in the innovation ecosystem. Figure B&#13;
shows the various actors and institutions relevant to the policy areas envisioned in&#13;
the STI policy. The key actors are structured into three broad stakeholder categories&#13;
namely: public sector; academic institutions; and industry. The public sector, include&#13;

government and its relevant agencies, support the import, adoption, and creation of&#13;

researcher, scientists and engineers affiliated with universities and research&#13;
institutions generate innovative knowledge, while industry, including large&#13;
corporation, SMEs, and start-up companies, produce goods and services.&#13;
Furthermore, academic institutions and industry would need to collaborate to&#13;
introduce and create new innovations that contribute to increased industrial&#13;
productivity.&#13;

Implementation of the Science, Technology and Innovation Policy&#13;
&#13;
The implementation of the STI policy for Ethiopia is crucial to facilitate linkages&#13;
between different actors and institutions involved in the innovation ecosystem.&#13;
While the current implementation arrangement is in line with international practice,&#13;
key lessons learned from global experience emphasize the importance of inter-&#13;
ministries and inter-agency bodies creating a coordinated and coherent&#13;
implementation of STI-policies. A few recommended policy actions that Government&#13;
of Ethiopia (GoE) could undertake include:&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            8&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Good Coordination mechanism. Given that the STI policy covers a wide range&#13;
       of topics which involve a number of organizations/institutions, a clear&#13;
       communication strategy among these stakeholders needs to be developed.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Monitoring &amp; Evaluation mechanism implemented. To monitor the&#13;
       progress of STI policy (and implementation strategy), the Key Performance&#13;
       Indicators need to be developed in line with GTP, national development&#13;
       strategy and disclosed to the public, together with their progress. This could&#13;
       potentially help inform future policy making.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Feedback Mechanism from the Private Sector. Given the crucial role that STI&#13;
       Policy plays in the move towards an export led industrial growth&#13;
       transformation, the implementation of the policy needs to have clear&#13;
       ownership from the private sector.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Robust National Quality Infrastructure (NQI). The STI Institutional and&#13;
       policy framework needs to support the development strategies for further&#13;
       strengthening the NQI which is crucial for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s transformation to an&#13;
       industrial led economy.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Framework for Inclusive Innovation Policy. The STI Policy has been framed&#13;
       under the vision of â&#128;&#156;alleviating poverty and joining the mid-level income&#13;
       earning countriesâ&#128;&#157;. Herein lies the clear role for Government to spearhead a&#13;
       strategy to develop an adequate policy framework for inclusive innovation.&#13;
&#13;
Promoting Greater Firm Level Innovation&#13;
&#13;
Facilitating Early Stage Financing and Capacity Building&#13;
&#13;
The distinct credit constraints for young and small firms in Ethiopia is a clear&#13;
impediment to innovation. Impediments to accessing finance for small and young&#13;
firms stem from the demand side of financial markets. Like in other developing&#13;
economies, credit in Ethiopia is more readily available to businesses that have fixed&#13;
assets such as land or buildings to be used as collateral than to those having movable&#13;
assets, as banks strongly prefer property to secure a loan. An increase in the support&#13;
in other areas of the economy towards early stage innovation financing would be&#13;
beneficial to entrepreneurs who are unable to find sources of financing through&#13;
commercial banks.&#13;
&#13;
Facilitating Learning from Exporting and Fostering Backward Links through Foreign&#13;
Direct Investment Growth&#13;
There is a need to promote linkages with and spillovers from foreign&#13;
investments with domestic firms. The Government has adopted policy focused on&#13;
the development of the manufacturing sector through the use of industrial parks to&#13;
&amp;#12;     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                                9&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
attract FDI and to support SMEs11. It would be beneficial for the investment agency to&#13;
work actively with the investor community and seek out input providers and support&#13;
services they require that could be provided by domestic SMEs. The Government thus&#13;
acts as a facilitator and gathering information on possible opportunities for links,12&#13;
assisting in identifying partners (and arrangements) by matching suppliersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
capabilities and buyersâ&#128;&#153; needs (legal assistance, fairs, missions, conferences and&#13;
exhibitions, and so forth), and providing economic incentives to multinationals to&#13;
promote training and technology transfer from buyer firms to local supplier firms and&#13;
for SMEs to invest in training and capacity building.&#13;
&#13;
Upgrading the National Quality Infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s continued support to develop NQI is crucial for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
transformation to an export led economy. Access to a good NQI is imperative to&#13;
assure that Ethiopian firms are able to enter and be competitive in international&#13;
markets by assuring that the quality of their services and products are aligned with&#13;
required standards in the international markets. To support innovation in the firm&#13;
level, in particular for exports, NQI services should be developed by incorporating&#13;
demand from the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
There is a need to develop a long term implementation strategy for the NQI&#13;
policy framework in Ethiopia. While the NQI institutions have developed their&#13;
strategies, in particular the steps required to obtain international recognition, it is&#13;
important to develop a long term strategy which includes the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
commitment of budget allocation, as all NQI institutions require long term financial&#13;
support from the government. This will ensure that all these institutions can make&#13;
medium to long term action plans to implement their strategies.&#13;
&#13;
To increase client satisfaction, the development of demand-driven NQI&#13;
institutions is important. NQI institutions need to ensure that firms and academic&#13;
and research institutions that receive NQI services are able to market their products&#13;
and services successfully. However, weak participation from these key stakeholders&#13;
in the governance of NQI institutions often hinders the development of demand-&#13;
driven NQI services. The development of a robust monitoring and evaluation system&#13;
is also critical to regularly review the effectiveness of the council and operation of&#13;
these NQI institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11World Bank (2015b)&#13;
12 Either directly or by supporting private institutions, governments promote the creation of information&#13;
exchanges that could range from lists of inputs and materials available locallyâ&#128;&#148;which might include prices and&#13;
qualitiesâ&#128;&#148;to names, locations, and profiles of local suppliers.&#13;
&amp;#12;     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                                10&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Promoting Effective Industry- Research Linkages&#13;
&#13;
Government can also provide its support to strengthen university-industry&#13;
linkages in order to promote innovation. A critical misalignment exists between&#13;
the research outputs from academic institutions and the technology needs of&#13;
industry. Furthermore, the type of curricula and skills endowments of the graduates&#13;
of universities do not match the immediate skill needs of industry13. To promote&#13;
collaboration and partnership between university and industry, government&#13;
programs; such as mini-grants and matching grants, to increase the incentives for the&#13;
cooperation is required. There is a need to better utilize the technology transfer&#13;
system that has been initiated in the Institute of Technologies (IoTs). Creating&#13;
incentives for researchers to collaborate with industry with this experience counting&#13;
towards a tenure track could ensure that researchers would be motivated to work&#13;
with industry. Finally, academic institutions should tap into the vast Ethiopian&#13;
diaspora to leverage on the global expertise and knowledge that they have by offering&#13;
them attractive short term assignments to work in the universities.&#13;
&#13;
The development of the national implementation strategy for the newly&#13;
established Ethiopian Agricultural Research Council (EARC) is crucial. While the&#13;
development of innovation in agriculture sector has been prioritized, the emphasis&#13;
on the effective coordination among the relevant stakeholders and improvement of&#13;
the quality of the staff and research needs to be stressed. According to the&#13;
Agricultural and Transformation Agency (ATA) annual report, the establishment of&#13;
EARC was approved by the government. The EARC will coordinate and oversee the&#13;
integration of various research efforts made by the different research institutions. To&#13;
support the existing coordination issues, the development of the detailed strategy to&#13;
address the existing issues and strengthen the national agricultural research system&#13;
is critical. This should be actively coordinated with the National Science, Technology&#13;
and Innovation Council that plays an important role in promoting and implementing&#13;
the necessary support mechanisms to adopt innovative technologies.&#13;
&#13;
Providing an Incentive Framework to foster Inclusive Innovation&#13;
&#13;
It is important role for the government to increase innovation for the BoP by&#13;
addressing their low demand due to limited access to information. Inclusive&#13;
innovation can boost the welfare of the BoP by providing innovative products and&#13;
finding innovative ways to address their needs. However, several examples show that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13&#13;
  Working paper prepared by Open African Innovation Research &amp; Training in 2012. Also, situation analysis of&#13;
research activity at Addis Ababa University found that none of the units at the university had set research&#13;
priorities based on national development objectives (Lemma 2008).&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            11&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
low levels of education among the BoP population hinder opportunities to gain&#13;
knowledge about potentially useful products. Establishing partnership with local&#13;
NGO or intermediaries to reach out to the targeted BoP population will be an&#13;
important element. The government has a role to play in developing a market for&#13;
inclusive innovation technologies that bear a high upfront cost leading to a lack of&#13;
incentives for the private sector to produce. The case of AAKASH Tablets in India&#13;
indicates the market for inclusive innovations can be developed by the government,&#13;
wherein the Government of India used demand side policies such as public&#13;
procurement by creating a market for low cost tablets. The government can also&#13;
provide its support to stimulate the adoption, adaptation, and generation of&#13;
innovative technologies by entrepreneurs, before the private sector is able to build a&#13;
profitable and scalable business solution. Ethiopia can leverage on existing initiatives&#13;
around the world by facilitating international linkages with firms and industry-&#13;
academia linkages to work on providing solutions.&#13;
&#13;
Raising Awareness&#13;
&#13;
The government has a key role to play in raising awareness of the private&#13;
benefits of undertaking innovative activities. This study has elaborated on how&#13;
government can facilitate innovative activity both to increase firm level productivity&#13;
and provide solutions aimed at addressing issues faced by the base of the pyramid.&#13;
Key barriers to inclusive innovation include consumer behavior, traditional business&#13;
models and information asymmetries that exist. The low rate of farmersâ&#128;&#153; adoption&#13;
rates of improved seeds is a case in point of risk aversion behavior that exists&#13;
preventing farmers from trying out something new. It is thus important for the state&#13;
to address this by increasing awareness and showcasing successful pilots to ensure&#13;
greater adoption of new technologies and processes. Finally, there is a role for&#13;
innovation to be encouraged amongst the young minds and for the school curricula&#13;
to encourage an innovation driven culture.&#13;
&#13;
The objective of all the policy instruments reviewed here is to create an ecosystem&#13;
that fosters greater levels of innovative activity promoting greater productivity and&#13;
increasing Ethiopian firm competitiveness and increasing the supply of innovative&#13;
ideas aimed at addressing the needs of the base of the pyramid thus bridging growth&#13;
and equity for the Ethiopian economy.&#13;

&#13;
CHAPTER 1: Innovation and Economic Growth in Ethiopia&#13;
1. Country Context&#13;
&#13;
1.      Rapid and consistent economic growth of Ethiopia over the past decade&#13;
has contributed to reducing the number of people living in poverty. The country&#13;
has shown rapid and robust growth at a steady pace of around 9 percent since 2000,&#13;
when it was ranked the second poorest in the world, to around 10 percent in the last&#13;
ten years. This growth has been accompanied by a consistent decline in poverty rates:&#13;
in this same period of time, the proportion of people living under the national poverty&#13;
line has dropped from a staggering 44 percent14 to 29 percent. Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
macroeconomic conditions have also improved; deficits have declined and inflation&#13;
is lower.&#13;
&#13;
2.     Nevertheless challenges to sustain its economic growth remain. In&#13;
relation to other countries in the region, Ethiopia has one of the lowest participations&#13;
of industry and manufacturing in GDP. Trade and services and manufacturing have&#13;
steadily grown since the 1990s, but remain relatively small when compared to&#13;
agriculture: in Gross Value Added (GVA) terms, agriculture represents about 45&#13;
percent of the economy, while trade and other services represent 19 and 21 percent,&#13;
respectively. Manufacturing, which is often most associated with structural change&#13;
only represents 4 percent of total GVA. In employment and productivity terms, the&#13;
gaps are spread even further.&#13;
&#13;
3.     As is the case with economic growth, the challenges to reduce poverty&#13;
remain. While poverty incidence has declined, it still remains high. The poorest, who&#13;
despite being engaged in agricultural activities, tend to be net buyers of agricultural&#13;
goods. Productivity rates and exports have performed poorly (in 2013; the trade and&#13;
services deficit was around 16 percent of GDP), and the countryâ&#128;&#153;s output is highly&#13;
concentrated. Indeed, the share of agricultural employment to total employment in&#13;
2011 was around 78 percent, while its share in GDP was 45 percent15. Trade, other&#13;
services and agriculture are between 3 and 10 times less productive than the most&#13;
productive sectors, while employing almost 95 percent of the population16. This&#13;
renders Ethiopia both uncompetitive, as its trade deficit continues to creep up, and&#13;
highly vulnerable, especially to price shocks and natural phenomena such as&#13;
droughts, common in the region.&#13;

                                                                                                14&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.     The Government of Ethiopia has created the Growth and Transformation&#13;
Plan (GTP)17, focusing on two overarching themes: fostering competitiveness and&#13;
employment and enhancing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities. This plan&#13;
recognizes that for poverty reduction and economic growth to be sustainable, the&#13;
Ethiopian economic structure will have to undergo a fundamental transformation.&#13;
Workers engaged in low-productivity jobs in the agricultural and informal sector&#13;
need to be reallocated to economic activities of higher productivity such as&#13;
manufacturing18.&#13;
&#13;
5.     However, there still remains an unfinished agenda for the successful&#13;
structural transformation from a predominantly agrarian to an industrialized&#13;
economy. Economic growth in FY2014, which grew real GDP by 10.3 percent&#13;
compared with 9.8 percent in FY2013, was driven mainly by the services sector,&#13;
which accounted for 5.3 percentage points of the growth, followed by industry of 2.8&#13;
percentage points thanks to a construction boom19. Agriculture, in turn, contributed&#13;
2.3 percentage points. However, the manufacturing sub-sector contributed only 0.5&#13;
percent to the GDP growth, less than the 0.7 percent contribution of the preceding&#13;
year. Moreover, the share of employment in the manufacturing sector has changed&#13;
only slightly and is virtually unchanged since 1999 at below 5 percent of total&#13;
employment.&#13;
&#13;
6.     In accordance with a focus on poverty reduction and economic growth,&#13;
the GTP has identified five main levers for change: public sector investment in&#13;
infrastructure to lay the ground for private sector development, enhancement of&#13;
policies and regulations to provide an environment conducive to competitiveness and&#13;
productivity, expanding access to credit for small and medium size enterprises,&#13;
provision of training and education to augment the supply of skilled labor and&#13;
improved access to land. While a new GTP, covering FY 2016 and forward will still&#13;
consider agriculture as a fundamental element for growth, there will be an added&#13;
emphasis to structural change and an additional focus to foster the development of&#13;
the private industrial sector.&#13;
&#13;
2. Role of Innovation&#13;
&#13;
7.    Technological adoption and innovation will hence play a crucial role in&#13;
delivering the goals laid out in the GTP. Innovation is now widely recognized as a&#13;
major engine for productivity growth. â&#128;&#156;Innovation implies technologies or policies&#13;

&#13;
that are new to a given country context or society. They are not necessarily new in&#13;
absolute terms but can be technologies and practices that are being diffused or&#13;
absorbed in that society or economy20.â&#128;&#157; This is particularly important for developing&#13;
economies that have potential for tremendous gains from tapping into the global&#13;
knowledge pool and adapting these to the local context. This ability will be important&#13;
notably in service industries, improving agricultural and industrial productivity and&#13;
for increasing service delivery in social sectors such as health and education.&#13;
&#13;
8.     The large size of the BoP calls for innovative ways to ensure that this&#13;
population has access to basic services such as health and education. With the&#13;
majority of the population residing in the rural areas, agriculture is still the major&#13;
source of national income, accounting for about 40 percent of GDP, more than 80&#13;
percent of employment, and 70 percent of national export earnings in 2013/14,&#13;
according to the African Economic Outlook. 66 percent of the population comprises&#13;
the BoP in Ethiopia subsisting on less than US$ 2 a day. Ethiopia ranked 172nd out of&#13;
187 countries on the United Nations Development Program's 2013 human&#13;
development index, and average per capita incomes are less than half the current sub-&#13;
Saharan average21.&#13;
&#13;
9.     â&#128;&#156;Inclusive innovation22â&#128;&#157; is important to address the needs of the BoP. It&#13;
seeks to provide better access to essential goods and services with affordable prices,&#13;
thereby improving quality of life, and enhancing economic empowerment of the&#13;
excluded populations, primarily at the BoP. The Government would play a pivotal role&#13;
in promoting technology either by directly supporting the development (and&#13;
adoption/absorption) of technologies or more indirectly by creating the enabling&#13;
environment to foster greater technological capabilities and innovative activity.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Most industrial sectors in Ethiopia are highly fragmented and&#13;
characterized by a large number of very small enterprises and a small number&#13;
of large firms. This structure favors heavily large businesses, and leaves small and&#13;
medium businesses small and uncompetitive, constrained by lack of access to land, to&#13;
capital, to inputs and to markets at large23.&#13;

22 Inclusive Innovation is any innovation that leads to affordable access of quality goods and services creating&#13;
&#13;
livelihood opportunities for the excluded population, primarily at the base of the pyramid and on a long term&#13;
sustainable basis with a significant outreach. Ramesh A. Mashelkar and Vinod K. Goel, â&#128;&#156;Inclusive Innovation:&#13;

                                                                                            16&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
11.      This competitive structure inhibits innovation across the economy (see&#13;
Aghion et al. 2005). Firms far behind the technological frontier may find investment&#13;
in innovation far too costly, while firms far ahead in the technological frontier see&#13;
little incentive in innovating, as their technological edge keeps them ahead of their&#13;
competitors in their current operating markets without the need for additional&#13;
investment.&#13;
&#13;
12.   Promoting competition in the Ethiopian economy would therefore create&#13;
greater incentives to innovate. Moreover, further enhancing competition by&#13;
promoting openness to trade and FDI would increase the presence of foreign&#13;
competitors, which would in turn increase exposure, search and adoption of more&#13;
advanced technologies by both export and import competing firms (see Schiff and&#13;
Wang, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
13.     Participation in foreign markets also induces firms to become more&#13;
innovative, a phenomenon known as â&#128;&#156;learning through exportingâ&#128;&#157;, as observed&#13;
among Ethiopian leather exporters. As firms begin participating in foreign markets,&#13;
customers begin providing signals such as quality standards and requirements for&#13;
market access, which serve as an incentive to absorb methods and technologies to&#13;
become or remain competitive. Lederman (2009) shows using firm-level data from&#13;
enterprise surveys in several countries, that a firmâ&#128;&#153;s export status (whether the firm&#13;
exports more than 10 percent of its sales) is positively correlated with the probability&#13;
that a firm innovates.&#13;
&#13;
14.     Furthermore, research and development (R&amp;D) is also a crucial&#13;
determinant of the ability for firms to innovate. In the same study, Lederman&#13;
(ibid.) finds evidence that a firmsâ&#128;&#153; investment in R&amp;D is significantly and positively&#13;
correlated with the probability that it will innovate. In developing countries however,&#13;
R&amp;D falls within what Cohen and Levinthal (1989) refer to as the â&#128;&#156;second face of&#13;
R&amp;Dâ&#128;&#157;, that is research and development oriented at absorbing new technologies and&#13;
keeping up with existing technologies worldwide, more so than aimed at developing&#13;
technologies that are new in absolute terms, an objective mostly limited to innovators&#13;
from the developed world.&#13;
&#13;
15.    Another vital determinant of innovative activity is the accumulation of&#13;
human capital and the skill level of the workforce. An educated workforce can be&#13;
considered a pre-condition for a country to have the capacity for knowledge&#13;
acquisition and adaptation, especially in an environment in which firms face&#13;
competitive pressures that call for frequent changes in product mix and production&#13;

     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
technology24. In his study, Lederman (ibid) finds evidence that the probability that a&#13;
firm innovates is related to the level of education of its personnel, and that there is a&#13;
link between the firmâ&#128;&#153;s level of training and its degree of technological adaptation. It&#13;
follows therefore, that higher levels of skills and training typically will lead a firm to&#13;
identify new technologies that need to be adopted, in order to increase&#13;
competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
16.    Ethiopia, not unlike other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa presents&#13;
significant potential to vastly increase its output for the manufacturing sector:&#13;
a broad base of low-skilled labor and low wages and labor costs relative to&#13;
competitors. It also enjoys an abundant endowment of natural resources, and&#13;
Ethiopian exports receive preferential tax and tariff-free access to the US and&#13;
European markets. The potential is particularly latent in light manufacturing, which,&#13;
if spurred by innovation should provide the ideal platform to help Ethiopia move&#13;
away from exports of primary commodities and become an export of value added&#13;
products. While certainly not the sole substitute to agriculture, light manufacturing&#13;
presents the advantage within the context of Ethiopia of not requiring large capital&#13;
investments while being able to absorb a large pool if low-skilled laborers.&#13;
&#13;
17.     In pursuing industrial upgrading, Ethiopia can fill the missing links in the&#13;
domestic value chain and move up the quality ladder, given the competitive&#13;
nature of the globalized economy. Moving up the value chain ladder is instrumental&#13;
if the Government of Ethiopia is to capitalize on the countryâ&#128;&#153;s comparative advantages&#13;
to foment growth and increase welfare. While the process of structural&#13;
transformation in many cases has been propelled by the private sector, in a&#13;
transitional landscape such as that of Ethiopia, the role of government in fostering&#13;
innovation is crucial.&#13;
&#13;
18.    On the other hand, by helping reduce reliance on natural resources,&#13;
innovation can also foster resilience, especially among populations in exposed&#13;
areas or regions. In agriculture, for instance, innovation can come in the form of&#13;
improved crops or irrigation systems to help insulate vulnerable populations from&#13;
the effects of weather or plant diseases. In manufacturing, on the other hand&#13;
innovation could represent improved production systems, better machinery&#13;
improved inputs or new management techniques.&#13;
&#13;
19.    Inclusive innovation however, can only thrive within a supportive&#13;
institutional framework. In many cases, institutional reforms are essential in order&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
to eliminate constraints such as policies that favor rent-seekers, or that favor a&#13;
particular social group or a gender over the other. Moreover, inclusive innovation&#13;
should needs to be demand-driven and include stakeholder in the business model&#13;
design and value chain. Stakeholders have to be involved in the process of identifying&#13;
their own needs such that innovation truly adapts to the local realities.&#13;
&#13;
20.    The private sector can play an important role in fostering inclusive&#13;
innovation. It could do so by creating and generating products and services that&#13;
serve low-income markets, and by integrating small producers into their supply and&#13;
distribution chains. In doing so, firms should be encouraged to participate in the&#13;
process of identification of challenges of those most in need, and to help in the&#13;
creation and dissemination of solutions to these problems, thus bolstering the&#13;
participation of the private sector in servicing the needs of the poor.&#13;
&#13;
21.    Enacting public policies that encourage companies to develop and use&#13;
technology, along with their marketing and distribution capabilities to provide&#13;
goods and services at affordable prices to the poor can have effects in more than&#13;
one level: they can help satisfy the needs of the poorest, generate profit for the&#13;
companies while spurring growth, and help create jobs. By including the Ethiopian&#13;
poor in the value chain, companies are ultimately helping enhance human capital and&#13;
increase incomes. This will in turn deepen their own market and increase their&#13;
potential for additional business. To this end, government policies should further&#13;
focus on removing legal and regulatory constraints while establishing public-private&#13;
partnerships that entice investment in the poor.&#13;
&#13;
22.    Within the framework of inclusive innovation, the Government of&#13;
Ethiopia could also provide stronger and targeted incentives and funding to&#13;
incite public and private institutions and universities to engage in R&amp;D focused&#13;
on socially relevant issues. Universities, for instance, can support inclusive&#13;
innovation in four specific ways: they can train future creators of innovation, they can&#13;
engage in research that develops new systems, products and processes, they can&#13;
provide technical assistance to innovators and finally, they can establish network&#13;
systems that promote research and development of innovative approaches and&#13;
solutions. NGOs, laboratories and research institutions can collaborate in a similar&#13;
manner to the process of innovation of the country, provided the government creates&#13;
appropriate mandates, grants, and research prizes for pro-poor initiatives to&#13;
guarantee the creation and dissemination of pro-poor knowledge.&#13;

3. Objective, Scope and Methodology&#13;
&#13;
23.     With this in mind, this study seeks: (i) to empirically analyze the extent of&#13;
innovative activities that formal firms are undertaking in Ethiopia; (ii) to conduct a&#13;
review of the existing innovation landscape, and (iii) to identify opportunities to&#13;
foster innovations at the base of the pyramid (BoP) in Ethiopia. By drawing on lessons&#13;
from ongoing innovation-focused interventions around the world, this study aims to&#13;
provide concrete policy recommendations to create an enabling environment for&#13;
private firms to undertake innovative activities to increase productivity, as well as to&#13;
provide innovative solutions to help alleviate poverty and facilitate more equitable&#13;
growth in the economy.&#13;
&#13;
24.   This study seeks to analyze the level of innovative activities that formal&#13;
private sector firms are undertaking as well as conduct a review of the existing&#13;
innovation landscape with a view to identify opportunities to foster&#13;
innovations for the base of the pyramid. To do so, it follows the following&#13;
methodology:&#13;
&#13;
25.    The empirical analysis will be conducted using the World Bank&#13;
enterprise surveys with the aim of distilling the specific traits that differentiate&#13;
innovative private sector firms from those that do not innovate. The analysis will&#13;
be conducted at two levels using the World Bank Enterprise Survey (2011) and the&#13;
specific Innovation module (2011). The enterprise survey will enable comparison&#13;
across a greater number of countries.&#13;
&#13;
26.    The variables in the database that would represent entrepreneurial&#13;
activity would include:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Introduction of a new or improved product;&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Introduction of a new or improved process; and&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Introduction of a new or improved technology.&#13;
&#13;
27.    The objective here would be to determine the variables that are&#13;
correlated to innovative activity within these existing private sector firms. The&#13;
surveys examine wide range of factors affecting the business environment. These&#13;
data possess many indicators of the factors that would enhance the underlying&#13;
capability of firms to undertake innovative activities â&#128;&#147; including, among others, the&#13;
skills mix of the workforce, training levels, R&amp;D spending, and measures of&#13;
international connectedness and both domestic and international competition. The&#13;
data would be used to analyze how innovative firms differ from non-innovative ones&#13;
within countries- in terms of age, size, productivity and industry.&#13;

 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28.     At the more detailed level, the innovation module that has been&#13;
conducted in Ethiopia will be analyzed to gain greater insights into the&#13;
characteristics of innovative firms. The focus of the detailed innovation module&#13;
will be to understand better the determinants of innovative activity amongst existing&#13;
firms. There will be an attempt to identify in greater detail specific links between the&#13;
firmâ&#128;&#153;s exposure to international technical best practices through trade and FDI, its&#13;
skill levels, and investments in R&amp;D to the level of innovative activity. The detailed&#13;
analysis would help investigate better the incentives for the firms to undertake&#13;
innovative activity. However since this was one of the pilot countries and is not a&#13;
representative sample, this analysis will not use comparator countries. The empirical&#13;
analysis has been conducted in the context of the national innovation ecosystem.&#13;
&#13;
29.     This study is structured as follows: Chapter 2 provides a detailed overview&#13;
of the characteristics of growth and innovation, by providing key insights based on&#13;
the enterprise survey analysis on the characteristics, motivations, operational and&#13;
market environment and constraints of the innovators in Ethiopia. Chapter 3 assesses&#13;
the innovation landscape in Ethiopia, by looking at the governmental and private&#13;
agencies responsible to promote innovation, as well as active programs, and donor&#13;
initiatives which may play a role in promoting firm level and pro-poor innovations.&#13;
Chapter 4 provides policy recommendations to promote innovation in Ethiopia both&#13;
at the firm level and in the form of pro-poor initiatives.&#13;

CHAPTER 2: Firm Level Innovation in Ethiopia&#13;
This chapter uses data from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Enterprise Surveys to analyze innovative&#13;
activity in existing private sector firms. Identifying what types of firms undertake&#13;
innovation activities, how much they innovate, and how they differ from firms that do&#13;
not innovate is essential for policymakers. While average innovation rates among&#13;
Ethiopian firms is modest, they are low compared to other comparator countries.&#13;
Innovation also has a relationship with firm level performance indicators in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
30.    As discussed in Chapter 1, modern theories of economic growth suggest that&#13;
sustained economic growth and improvement in living standards require sustained&#13;
technological progress, underpinned by innovation. In developing countries such as&#13;
Ethiopia, located well within the global technological frontier, innovation is&#13;
incremental and synonymous with adopting and adapting technologies developed in&#13;
advanced economies. Such incremental innovation is central to the growth and&#13;
survival of firms and to the process of industrialization and structural change.&#13;
&#13;
1. Data and Methodology&#13;
&#13;
31.    This chapter explores the patterns of innovation levels and attempts to&#13;
establish innovation correlates in Ethiopia using data from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Enterprise Survey (ES). Various empirical studies have explored firm-level&#13;
determinants of innovation and of technology adoption. Most studies, however, focus&#13;
on firms in developed (and upper middle income) countries, mainly because of data&#13;
availability but also because innovation is often considered to be the domain of large&#13;
firms with intensive R&amp;D structures, located in developed countries. Nevertheless,&#13;
growing firm-level data collection has allowed for an increasing number of studies to&#13;
explore the rates and the determinants of innovation in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
32.    Innovation is captured by product, process, marketing and&#13;
organizational changes and improvements. Starting in 2011, the ES questionnaire&#13;
introduced a section on innovation, designed to collect information about firm-level&#13;
innovative activities in selected developing countries. At its core, innovation is&#13;
conceptualized by the standard defined in the Oslo Manual (OECD, 2005)25. The&#13;
measures used to specify whether innovation activities have taken place are the&#13;
following four: i) product innovation, based on the following question in the survey:&#13;
â&#128;&#156;During the last three years, has this establishment introduced new or significantly&#13;
improved products or services?â&#128;&#157;; ii) process innovation based on the following&#13;

&amp;#12;     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                                22&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
question in the survey: â&#128;&#156;During the last three years, has this establishment introduced&#13;
any new or significantly improved methods of manufacturing products or offering&#13;
services?â&#128;&#157;; iii) R&amp;D activity based on the following question in the survey: â&#128;&#156;During the&#13;
last three years, did this establishment spend on formal research and development&#13;
activities, either in-house or contracted with other companies?â&#128;&#157;; and iv) process or&#13;
product innovation, indicating whether the firm has answered affirmatively to either&#13;
i) or ii) and hence introduced a new or significantly improved product or method of&#13;
production/rendering services.&#13;
&#13;
33.     It is important to note that a potential issue with these measures of&#13;
innovation is, that for an activity to be considered as innovation, suffice that it&#13;
be new or significantly improved to the firm. This means that there is a potential&#13;
for measurement error arising from the respondentâ&#128;&#153;s view as to what constitutes new&#13;
or significantly improved26. Although the ES questionnaire provides respondents&#13;
with lists of examples of new or significantly improved products or processes in order&#13;
to minimize this subjectivity, the responses are likely to vary based on the knowledge&#13;
and on the judgment of the respondent.&#13;
&#13;
2. Innovation and its Correlates&#13;
&#13;
34.    This section explores innovation by firms in Ethiopia and how its&#13;
incidence compares to that of selected comparators27. It further explores how&#13;
some of the key firm-level attributes correlate with a firmâ&#128;&#153;s propensity to innovate.&#13;
Finally, we look at certain measures of firm performance and how these relate to&#13;
whether a firm introduces a new product or introduces changes to its production or&#13;
business processes. It is structured in the following way: first we provide&#13;
comparisons between the incidences of innovation in Ethiopia and in selected&#13;
comparators, followed by a brief discussion of the nature of innovation in the country&#13;
using a follow-up innovation survey. We then proceed to present and discuss two sets&#13;
of regression analyses; in the first we attempt to establish links between key firm&#13;
specific attributes and the likelihood that firms will introduce innovations; followed&#13;
by analyses of the potential correlations between innovation and three different&#13;
measures of firm performance controlling for the same key firm attributes mentioned&#13;
above. The section concludes with a brief summary of the findings.&#13;
&#13;
26 Mairesse and Mohnen (2010) provide an excellent review of the potential issues with these types of&#13;
innovation measures.&#13;
27 We use two main comparators, Kenya (2013) and a group of low-income countries. The latter consists of low-&#13;
&#13;
income countries for which the latest Enterprise Survey has questions on innovative activities, excluding&#13;
Ethiopia (2011), namely: Afghanistan (2014), Bangladesh (2013), Central African Republic (2011), Democratic&#13;
Republic of Congo (2013), Kenya (2013), Myanmar (2014), Nepal (2013), Rwanda (2011), Tajikistan (2013),&#13;
Tanzania (2013), Uganda (2013) and Zimbabwe (2011). Where data is available, we also include China (2012)&#13;
as an additional comparator.or.&#13;

                                                                                                23&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
35.    Close to 40 percent of the firms in the country have engaged in either&#13;
product or process innovations, but this is lower rate than those of selected&#13;
comparators. Figure 2.1 summarizes the incidence of the four measures of&#13;
innovation in Ethiopia and in the selected comparators, as collected through the&#13;
Enterprise Survey. More than one third of the firms in Ethiopia report having&#13;
introduced new products or services during the course of the three years prior to the&#13;
time of the survey, while over 40 percent of the firms indicated introducing new&#13;
methods of production or new methods of rendering services during this same period&#13;
of time.&#13;
&#13;
36.    Only 20 percent of the surveyed firms in Ethiopia indicated spending on&#13;
R&amp;D. This low rate of spending on R&amp;D is, however, usual in low-income countries&#13;
like Ethiopia where most innovation involves adopting and adapting existing&#13;
products and methods of production which require limited R&amp;D activities, if any.&#13;
&#13;
37.    Overall, Ethiopia compares unfavorably to China, Kenya and a group of&#13;
low-income countries (LIC) in terms of innovation. The share of firms reporting&#13;
process innovation and spending on R&amp;D in China is almost double that of Ethiopia,&#13;
and, except for R&amp;D, the portion of firms that innovate in Ethiopia is about 10 to 20&#13;
percentage points smaller than that of the LICs. The difference between Ethiopia and&#13;
Kenya is particularly stark, as innovation rates in Kenya are almost double those of&#13;
Ethiopia in all four observed measures (Figure 2.1).&#13;

38.    Innovation varies depending on different firm characteristics, firm size&#13;
in particular. Firm size often serves as a proxy for other unobservable firm attributes&#13;
that could affect the propensity to innovate, such as access to finance and to product&#13;
and labor markets. Figure 2.2 presents shares of firms that have introduced&#13;
innovations, disaggregated by firm size using three categories: small (5 to 19&#13;
employees), medium (20 to 99 employees) and large (100 and more employees)29.&#13;
Results are reported only for two of the four measures of innovation: whether the&#13;
firm undertook either product or process innovation and whether the firm spent on&#13;
R&amp;D in the three years prior to the survey.&#13;
&#13;
39.    Over two thirds of large firms in Ethiopia undertook either product or&#13;
process innovation, that is about 20 percentage points more than the share of&#13;
small and medium firms. Moreover, the gap in innovation share between large and&#13;
small firms in Ethiopia is 26 percentage points, second only to that of China and 6&#13;
percentage points above the sample average. Notwithstanding, large firms in Ethiopia&#13;
tend to innovate less than those in the comparator countries: in China and Kenya, over&#13;
80 percent of large firms have engaged in either product or process innovation, while&#13;
77 percent of firms in the group of LICs have done so.&#13;
&#13;
40.     The share of small sized firms that report introducing product or process&#13;
innovation during the three years prior to the survey is 42 percent. This share is&#13;
smaller than the share of firms in the same category in China that introduced&#13;
innovations as well as the share in the group of low income countries (53 and 56&#13;
percent, respectively). The share of firms in this category in Kenya (82 percent),&#13;
which have innovated products or processes, is almost double the corresponding&#13;
figure for Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
41.       Existing evidence indicates that the limited amount of R&amp;D spending in&#13;
developing countries corresponds mostly to large firms. In line with this, there is&#13;
a clear difference in Ethiopia between small, medium and large firms in terms of their&#13;
respective R&amp;D spending: a third of both large and medium sized firms in the country&#13;
report having spent on R&amp;D while only 7 percent of small firms report to have done&#13;
so (Figure 2.2, Panel B). In fact, the rate of spending on R&amp;D by small firms in Ethiopia&#13;
is the lowest, when compared to China, Kenya and the group of LICs, by 24, 14 and 11&#13;
percentage points, respectively. The proportion of firms spending on R&amp;D is overall&#13;
higher in China than in all the other comparators in all the three size categories,&#13;
although the difference in proportions between the size categories is not as stark as&#13;
it is in the other three comparator countries (Figure 2.2 Panel B).&#13;
&#13;
29   The Enterprise Survey uses these three levels for classifying the firm size,&#13;

42.     The share of firms that report introducing innovations in the&#13;
manufacturing sector is larger than the share of firms that do so in the services&#13;
sector by between 18 and 20 percentage points. Figure 2.3 provides a closer look&#13;
at this, by splitting firms into two broad sectors: manufacturing and services. This&#13;
pattern is not specific to Ethiopia, although the gap is substantially larger in Ethiopia&#13;
than it is in the comparator countries. The lower rates of innovation in the service&#13;
sector could be explained by the fact that product and process innovations naturally&#13;
favor the manufacturing sector, while marketing and organizational innovation tend&#13;
to be the most common forms of innovation undertaken by firms in the services&#13;
sector. It could also be due to the fact that services firms are more heterogeneous than&#13;
manufacturing firms, which would pull down the average share of firms who innovate&#13;

                                                                                            26&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
in the services sector. Yet another possible explanation could be that services firms&#13;
tend to be disproportionately smaller than manufacturing firms, and as discussed&#13;
above, smaller firms are proportionally less likely to innovate. In Ethiopia for&#13;
instance, more than 30 percent of the sampled firms that operated in the&#13;
manufacturing sector fall into the â&#128;&#156;largeâ&#128;&#157; category, while only 11 percent of firms in&#13;
the services sector do so. Therefore, the lower proportions of innovation by firms in&#13;
the services sector is a reflection of the variation in the shares of innovation rates&#13;
across firm size.&#13;

&amp;#12;     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                                27&#13;

&#13;
generated through interactions with the external environment30. Thus, a critical&#13;
component of successful innovation is the ability of a firm to source and utilize&#13;
external knowledge. To better understand this in Ethiopia, information in a follow-up&#13;
survey that focuses on innovation, administered to manufacturing firms selected&#13;
from those included in the 2011 Ethiopia Enterprise Survey31 is analyzed.&#13;
&#13;
44.     Through this survey important insights regarding the main sources of&#13;
information that drive innovative activities within firms is captured. It is found&#13;
that almost one third of interviewed firms cited customer feedback as the main source&#13;
(See Table 2.1). The second most important source, according to 17 percent of the&#13;
interviewees, were products from other firms that already existed in the domestic&#13;
market, corroborating the view that most innovation in developing countries consists&#13;
of diffusion of existing knowledge. Transfer of knowledge from parent firms&#13;
constitutes the third most important source of information for innovation as cited by&#13;
13 percent of the firms. Further, and in line with anecdotal evidence of the limited&#13;
interaction between the private sector and formal education and research&#13;
institutions in Ethiopia, only 1 percent of the interviewed firms indicated that these&#13;
institutions were their main sources of information for innovative activities. Finally,&#13;
while not as important as the three main sources of information, still a noteworthy 7&#13;
percent of the interviewed firms said fairs, exhibitions and conferences were their&#13;
main source of information to innovate.&#13;

45.    About 47 percent of the firms that had introduced innovations to their&#13;
products indicated that they had done so by adapting existing goods. These had&#13;
been developed by someone else and were already available in the market32. About&#13;
12 percent of the firms recognized entirely reproducing an already existing product.&#13;
About a third of the firms reported that the innovation of their product resulted from&#13;
an original idea. About 15 percent of the firms said their product was developed&#13;
through a blueprint that was purchased or licensed from a third party.&#13;
&#13;
46.    Close to half of the interviewed firms indicated that the innovation&#13;
occurred entirely in-house and was developed by the firm, when attempting to&#13;
determine who was directly responsible for developing the new product. Meanwhile&#13;
a quarter of the respondents indicated that it was developed in collaboration with&#13;
other firms. Yet another quarter of the firms indicated that third parties were&#13;
responsible for the development of the new product.&#13;

3. Correlates of Innovation: Regression results&#13;
&#13;
47.     Relationship between firm characteristics and firm level innovative&#13;
activity exist. As discussed in the previous section, there seems to be a relationship&#13;
between the size of a firm and the sector in which the firm operates and whether the&#13;
firm is or isnâ&#128;&#153;t an innovator. In this section, regression analyses is applied to analyze&#13;
some of the key firm-level attributes that appear to be correlated with the propensity&#13;
&#13;
32 Firms that undertook product innovation are further asked questions on how the new or improved product was&#13;
&#13;
developed and who within the firm developed it.&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            29&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
of firms to engage in innovation. Given that the dependent variables of interest are&#13;
categorical33, the following probit equation for the conditional probability that a firm&#13;
will innovate was estimated:&#13;
&#13;
         Inov = Î± + Î²1 â&#136;&#151; Î² X + Îµ â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦.. (1)&#13;
&#13;
Where i is index for firms, j is index for the covariates,   is one of the four measures&#13;
we have established as innovation, namely product innovation, process innovation,&#13;
product or process innovations, and spending on R&amp;D. Various firm-level&#13;
characteristics that could influence the propensity of a firm to innovate are controlled&#13;
for and are represented by the vector X.&#13;
&#13;
48.      Existing studies indicate that firm size and age are among standard&#13;
observable covariates associated with various firm-level outcome measures. As&#13;
discussed above, the size of the firm may serve as a proxy for various unobservable&#13;
firm attributes that might affect the likelihood to innovate, such as the ability to&#13;
attract highly skilled workforce and talented managers. Size is measured as the (log&#13;
of) a firmâ&#128;&#153;s total employment, and firm age as the (log of) the year of the ES minus the&#13;
year in which the firm started operating. The sector in which the firm operates is&#13;
another important correlate, as it captures the fact that firms in different sectors have&#13;
different needs and capacities to innovate (Agarwal and Gort (2002)). In the&#13;
regression, sector is controlled for by disaggregating it into several subsectors: textile&#13;
and garments, food, leather, information technology, and retail. A residual category is&#13;
included to capture all other subsectors34.&#13;
&#13;
49.     A large body of literature shows that exposure to foreign markets can be&#13;
an important determinant of a firmsâ&#128;&#153; need and ability to innovate35. Access to&#13;
foreign markets, for instance, may force firms to innovate in order to be competitive&#13;
in international markets. Exposure to foreign markets can also enhance firmsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
innovative capability by improving their access to better human and better financial&#13;
capital. Two proxy measures are used to control for these phenomena: a dummy&#13;
variable indicating whether the firm is an exporter or not, and an indicator of whether&#13;
the firm is foreign-owned36 or not. The measure of investment in human capital is&#13;
controlled for by using a dummy to reflect whether the firm provides training to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
33 Equation is estimated using weighted probit to account for the fact that ES data is collected using a stratified&#13;
&#13;
sampling method.&#13;
34 The base (excluded) sectors include all other services, except Information Technology; and all other&#13;
&#13;
manufacturing sectors other than the textile &amp; garments, leather and food sectors.&#13;
35 For instance, Almeida and Fernandes (2008); Seker (2012); and Alvarez and Robertson (2004).&#13;
36 We consider a firm foreign-owned if 10% or more of its equity is owned by foreigners.&#13;

                                                                                                30&#13;

employees or not and another dummy to capture firms which give their employees&#13;
time to experiment.&#13;
&#13;
50.    A number of theoretical and empirical studies have shown that access to&#13;
external finance is one of the most critical factors to spur innovation37. The&#13;
dummy variable indicating whether a firm is credit constrained or not is used as a&#13;
control, constructed based on a series of finance-specific questions in the ES designed&#13;
to capture a firmâ&#128;&#153;s access to external finance38.&#13;
&#13;
51.     Firm size does not matter for innovative activity when controlling for&#13;
other firm level attributes. Table A2.1 provides estimates39 of the probit regression&#13;
for Ethiopia and for the three comparators. The first three columns of the table show&#13;
the estimation results when using product innovation as the dependent variable. The&#13;
model shows that firm size doesnâ&#128;&#153;t appear to have a significant correlation with&#13;
product innovation in Ethiopia or Kenya, indicating that the importance of size in&#13;
these two contexts disappears once we control for other firm-level attributes. In the&#13;
group of LIC countries, however, we observe that there is a positive effect of firm-size&#13;
over the firmâ&#128;&#153;s propensity to develop new products, albeit small in relative terms.&#13;
&#13;
52.     In Ethiopia, the results show that the older a firm gets, the less likely it is&#13;
that it will conduct product innovation. This falls in line with existing evidence that&#13;
performance tends to slow down as firms get older. In Kenya, however, the age of the&#13;
firm is positively correlated with the probability to innovate, suggesting that older&#13;
firms are more likely to engage in product innovation than young firms are. Finally,&#13;
the age of the firm is not significantly correlated with product innovation in the group&#13;
of low income countries.&#13;
&#13;
53.    The sector of the firm matters when it comes to the probability that a&#13;
firm will innovate in Ethiopia. Firms in the textile and garment and in the food&#13;
sectors in particular, are more likely to engage in product innovation than do those in&#13;
the base category. This is likely due to the recent emergence of the textile and&#13;
garment industry in the country as an alternative to traditional activities, and to the&#13;
inherent heterogeneity of the food sector. In Kenya, conversely, there doesnâ&#128;&#153;t appear&#13;
to be any correlation between the probability that a firm will innovate its product line,&#13;
and the sector in which it operates. Lastly, in our group of LICs, operating in the&#13;
leather sector increases the likelihood of engaging in product innovation.&#13;

 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
54.    Providing training to employees and allowing employeesâ&#128;&#153; time to&#13;
experiment are both factors that positively correlate with the probability to&#13;
engage in product innovation. This is not only true for Ethiopia but also in the&#13;
comparator group of LICs. In the case of Kenya, providing time to experiment&#13;
increases the probability that a firm will innovate, but there is no correlation between&#13;
providing training and product innovation. These findings corroborate the&#13;
importance of human capital for innovation.&#13;
&#13;
55.     Limited access to credit poses a significant barrier to product innovation&#13;
in Ethiopia. Firms that are credit constrained are about 14 percentage points less&#13;
likely to undertake product innovation than are non-credit constrained ones,&#13;
everything else remaining equal. Credit constraint however, does not affect the&#13;
likelihood to innovate in the two comparator countries. It is important to note that&#13;
practically none of the proxy variables for access to foreign markets predict&#13;
innovation, except in Kenya where exporter firms are more likely to innovate than&#13;
non-exporters are. In the case of Ethiopia in particular, this may be due to the fact that&#13;
exports are highly concentrated in commodities where margins tend to be very low&#13;
and value-added very limited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            Box 2.1: Ethiopian financial sector&#13;
 At present, the Ethiopian financial sector services only a small fraction of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
 population, with some estimates suggesting that less than 10 percent of Ethiopian&#13;
 households have access to formal credit (African Economic Outlook, 2013). For firms,&#13;
 the main source of funds is loans from banks or MFIs, since capital markets do not&#13;
 function effectively and more tailored and sophisticated financing products such as&#13;
 leasing and equity funds are not widely available.&#13;
  Constraints for â&#128;&#152;Start-upâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;Scale-upâ&#128;&#153; Innovators&#13;
  While access to finance is a major obstacle for all Ethiopian firms, the challenge is&#13;
  particularly acute for young firms and small firms, which are most likely to be the sites&#13;
  of innovation. According the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Enterprise survey data, only 1.9 percent of&#13;
  small enterprises have access to a loan or line of credit, compared to 6 percent of micro-&#13;
  enterprises and 20.5 percent of medium enterprises. Small firms are also much more&#13;
  likely to be rejected for a loan. Young firms, aged five years or less, also face distinctive&#13;
  barriers. Only 7.3 percent of young firms have a loan, compared to 14.0 percent of old&#13;
  firms. 55.9 percent of young firms have loan applications rejected, compared to 32.6&#13;
  percent of old firms.&#13;

&#13;
Impediments to accessing finance for small and young firms stem from the demand&#13;
side of financial markets. Like in other developing economies, credit in Ethiopia is more&#13;
readily available to businesses that have fixed assets such as land or buildings to be&#13;
used as collateral than to those having movable assets, as banks strongly prefer&#13;
property to secure a loan. The average value of collateral needed for loans in Ethiopia&#13;
(234 percent of the loan amount) is also very high compared to other regions of the&#13;
world as well as to other developed economies in Africa.&#13;
The distinct credit constraints for young and small firms in Ethiopia is a clear&#13;
impediment to innovation. The use of external financing is associated with greater&#13;
innovation (GFDR, 2014), because it allows firms to take innovative ideas from concept&#13;
to implementation, and to absorb the high-start-up costs related to design and proof-&#13;
of-concept stages of an innovative product or service. The constraints to finance not&#13;
only prevent innovative ideas from attracting investment to reach scale, they also deter&#13;
entrepreneurs from investing in start-up technologies.&#13;

                 Box 2.2: CASE STUDY: Credit Constraints for Scaling Up&#13;
&#13;
                   Online Hisab is an innovative Ethiopian tech start-up which offers&#13;
a cloud-based accounting package for Ethiopian SMEs. Online Hisabâ&#128;&#153;s innovative&#13;
product offering is premised on the idea that many Ethiopian SMEs donâ&#128;&#153;t use&#13;
accounting software because the licenses are too costly, the software is too difficult to&#13;
understand, or their computers are too dated to run the programs. Online Hisab allows&#13;
Ethiopian SMEs to use simplified, Amharic-language, cloud-based versions of the latest&#13;
accounting software developed on a subscription basis, removing the need for upfront&#13;
capital investment in terms of hardware and software, as well as upgrade costs.&#13;
Online Hisab has generated excitement and attention for its innovative product&#13;
offering. It was awarded the Pivot Prize for Innovation, East Africaâ&#128;&#153;s premier award for&#13;
innovative start-ups. It was also featured as one of the â&#128;&#152;Top Five Tech Companies to&#13;
Watch in Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153; by Selamta Magazine, and it was selected as one of the top 20&#13;
innovative ideas in Africa at this yearâ&#128;&#153;s Demo Africa technology conference.&#13;

&#13;
  Online Hisabâ&#128;&#153;s founder, Asmeret Gebre, describes herself as a â&#128;&#152;childhood&#13;
  entrepreneurâ&#128;&#153;, having had an entrepreneurial spirit from her earliest years. The&#13;
  expansion of her innovative idea, however, has stalled due to her inability to access&#13;
  credit. Asmeret used her own start-up capital to develop and pilot test the product, and&#13;
  identified significant market opportunity. She now needs a loan of 2.5 Million Birr to&#13;
  market the product, hire sales staff, and fund the scale-up of Online Hisab. She has been&#13;
  denied a loan from both commercial banks and MFIs, since the value of her collateral&#13;
  is not high enough to secure the loan size she needs. As a result, the scale-up of Online&#13;
  Hisab, a promising and tested innovation, seems likely to falter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
56.    In Ethiopia, three of the control variables, sector, measure of credit&#13;
constraint, and whether the firm provides employees time to experiment, are&#13;
correlated with process innovation. The second set of the three columns in the&#13;
Table A2.1 provides estimates for the likelihood of innovation of processes. Firms that&#13;
operate in the textile and garments, leather, food and IT sectors, show a significantly&#13;
higher likelihood of introducing new or upgrading existing methods of production or&#13;
rendering services. Operating in the food industry in particular, increases the&#13;
probability of introducing innovative processes by as much as 50 percentage points.&#13;
Operating in the IT and textile and garments sectors increases the probability of&#13;
process innovation by 36 and 41 percentage points, respectively. Finally, firms in&#13;
Ethiopia that offer employees time to experiment are about 40 percentage points&#13;
more likely to engage in process innovation than those who do not, while credit&#13;
constrained firms are about 17 percentage points less likely to undertake process&#13;
innovation.&#13;
&#13;
57.    Firm size, age, and sector have no significant correlation with the&#13;
probability of spending on R&amp;D in Ethiopia. Counterintuitively, in the case of&#13;
Ethiopia, the fact that the firm is at least partly owned by foreigners lowers the firmâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
propensity to spend on R&amp;D by 6 percent (Table A2.1). This may indicate that foreign-&#13;
owned firms in Ethiopia, particularly those that operate as subsidiaries of companies&#13;
headquartered in other countries, conduct all the necessary fine-tuning and&#13;
adaptation of their product lines or their production processes in their home country&#13;
and, therefore, do not need to conduct any R&amp;D activity in Ethiopia. While one would&#13;
expect that being an exporter could be correlated to whether a firm would spend on&#13;
R&amp;D, this was only the case of firms in the group of low income countries, where being&#13;
an exporter increased the propensity to carry out R&amp;D activities by 8 percentage&#13;

                                                                                                34&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
points. While surprising, further research is required in order to explore the role of&#13;
foreign firms in facilitating technological transfer to the host country40.&#13;
&#13;
58.     Based on traditional economic theories human capital would be an&#13;
important determinant of the likelihood to undertake R&amp;D activities. In fact one&#13;
would expect that it would be a more important determinant for undertaking R&amp;D&#13;
activity than it would be to affect the likelihood to generate product or process&#13;
innovations. In line with such expectations, the two proxy measures of human capital&#13;
have a positive and significant effect on the likelihood of spending on R&amp;D in Ethiopia:&#13;
firms that offer training to employees are about 13 and a half percentage points more&#13;
likely to spend on R&amp;D, while firms that allow employees time to experiment are 14&#13;
percentage points more likely to spend on R&amp;D than are those who donâ&#128;&#153;t provide&#13;
either one of these benefits. Similarly, providing training and allowing the employees&#13;
additional time to experiment has an effect on the likelihood of spending on R&amp;D in&#13;
both Kenya and in the group of low income countries, but the magnitudes of the&#13;
coefficients are still larger for Ethiopia than they are for these two comparators.&#13;
&#13;
59.     Finally, in Ethiopia, access to credit is another important predictor of&#13;
firmsâ&#128;&#153; propensity to spend on R&amp;D, as credit constrained firms are about 11&#13;
percentage points less likely to spend on R&amp;D than non-constrained firms. Similar&#13;
results hold for LICs, where credit constrained firms are about five percentage points&#13;
less likely to spend in R&amp;D. In Kenya, there does not appear to be any correlation&#13;
between access to credit and the likelihood that the firm will spend on R&amp;D.&#13;
&#13;
4. Innovation and firm performance&#13;
&#13;
60.     A stark difference between innovators and non-innovators in terms of&#13;
real sales growth is observed in Ethiopia. This section considers the association&#13;
between innovation and different measures of annual firm performance, namely:&#13;
employment growth, real sales growth and labor productivity growth. Firms that&#13;
innovate their product line present on average, annual real sales growth of about 8&#13;
percent, compared with a sales decline of 8 percent in those firms that have not&#13;
undertaken any product innovation (Figure 2.4, Panel A). A similar pattern holds for&#13;
process innovation: firms that have introduced new processes in Ethiopia present&#13;
real sales growth of around 9 percent, compared to a 9 percent sales decline in firms&#13;
that have not introduced any new processes. Similarly, in the three other&#13;
comparators, a similar pattern holds: firms that have introduced new products or&#13;
&#13;
40Almeida and Fernandes (2008) show, using firm-level data for a large set of developing countries, that major&#13;
foreign-owned firms are less likely to engage in innovation, perhaps because the firms fear expropriation in the&#13;
host country.&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            35&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
processes have performed better in terms of sales growth, on average, than those&#13;
firms that have not introduced either. In the case of Kenya, however, this translates&#13;
into a lower sales decline, as both firms with and without innovations present&#13;
negative sales growth, although the extent of the decline is smaller in the case of firms&#13;
that have indeed innovated. Notably, the magnitude of the sales growth performance&#13;
gap between innovators and non-innovators is considerably higher in Ethiopia than&#13;
it is in the comparators.&#13;
&#13;
61.    In terms of employment growth, a similar trend can be observed&#13;
between innovating and non-innovating firms in Ethiopia: firms that did innovate&#13;
added employment at about 20 percent per annum, 8 percentage points more than&#13;
did non-innovators. China and the LICs, show a similar pattern, although the&#13;
magnitude of the difference in employment growth between innovators and non-&#13;
innovators is less substantial than it is in Ethiopia. In Kenya, the difference between&#13;
the two groups is not distinctly clear, as firms that have introduced new products&#13;
have increased employment less than one percentage point more than firms that have&#13;
not introduced any new products, while firms with and without process innovations&#13;
have both presented similar employment growths at 2.4 percent.&#13;
&#13;
62.     In terms of labor productivity, the survey yields interesting results. While&#13;
in Ethiopia a similar pattern is observed as that of employment and sales growth, that&#13;
is firms that have introduced new products or new processes have outperformed&#13;
those that have not introduced a new product or process; the trend is not as cut-clear&#13;
across the other comparators except for Kenya. Further, a systematic deterioration is&#13;
observed in the labor productivity of firms across most comparators except China. In&#13;
the case of Ethiopia and Kenya the situation appears particularly dire, as labor&#13;
productivity has in fact declined between 10 and 22 percent per year depending on&#13;
whether the firm has introduced any innovations or not. In Ethiopia, Kenya and the&#13;
group of LICs, however there was a smaller decline when the firm had introduced&#13;
innovations. The difference is largest in Ethiopia, where companies without product&#13;
innovations experienced a labor productivity decline of 18 percent, while the decline&#13;
for firms with product innovations was of 11 percent. Similarly, Ethiopian firms that&#13;
did not introduce any innovations to their processes experienced a decline in labor&#13;
productivity of 19 percent, while firms who did introduce new processes only&#13;
experienced a 10 percent decline in productivity. In China firms did experience labor&#13;
productivity growth, but interestingly enough, firms with new products experienced&#13;
a larger productivity growth than firms without new products while firms with new&#13;
processes experienced less than half the productivity growth than did firms which&#13;
did not change their processes.&#13;
&amp;#12;     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                                36&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
63.    Overall, the association between innovation and firm performance&#13;
appears to be stronger in the case of Ethiopian firms. This will be explored in&#13;
more detail using regression analyses to see whether this association holds after&#13;
controlling for other firm characteristics. For this analyses the following&#13;
parsimonious model is estimated:&#13;
&#13;
           Perf = Î± + Î² Inov + Î² X + Îµ â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦â&#128;¦ (2)&#13;
&#13;
Where i represents firm id, j represents the id of the covariates; Perf represents one&#13;
of the three measures of performance; Inov represents one of the four measures of&#13;
innovation discussed in earlier sections; and Îµ is the error term. In addition to&#13;
controlling for the four measures of innovation that were introduced in earlier&#13;
sections, standard firm characteristics that would affect firm performance are also&#13;
controlled for, notably firm sector, age, size, exporting status, foreign ownership&#13;
status, and a measure of whether the firm is credit constrained or not. Equation 2 is&#13;
estimated using a simple OLS method41 and the results of the model for annual real&#13;
sales growth, employment growth and productivity, are presented in Tables A2.2,&#13;
A2.3 and A2.4 respectively.&#13;

&#13;
64.    Product and process innovations both show a positive and significant&#13;
correlation with sales growth in Ethiopia and Kenya. In Ethiopia in particular,&#13;
product and process innovations explain an increase in the sales growth of about 18&#13;
percent each, all other factors being constant (Table A2.1). Spending on research and&#13;
development, on the other hand, does not present a statistically significant&#13;
relationship with sales growth, suggesting either a limited role of R&amp;D in firm sales&#13;
performance or possibly the fact that there is a lag between the expenditure on R&amp;D&#13;
and it translating into increased sales revenue. In Kenya, product and process&#13;
innovations are positively correlated with sales growth as well, although the&#13;
magnitudes of the correlation coefficients are almost half of those observed in&#13;
Ethiopia. Product innovation accounts for about 8 percent of the change in sales&#13;
growth in Kenya, and process innovation for about 11 percent. In LICs, only product&#13;
innovation is correlated with sales growth: the fact that a firm has introduced new&#13;
products explains about 2 percent of the increase in the firmâ&#128;&#153;s growth in sales. There&#13;

                                                                                            38&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
is no correlation between sales growth and process innovation nor between sales&#13;
growth and spending on R&amp;D.&#13;
&#13;
65.     There is a significant correlation between access to credit and sales&#13;
growth in firms in Ethiopia. Access to credit is the only control variable that has a&#13;
significant correlation with sales growth in Ethiopia and in all comparators. While in&#13;
Ethiopia and in the group of LICs this relationship is negative, it is positive in Kenya.&#13;
This means that in Ethiopia and in the group of LICs, credit constraint drives a decline&#13;
in the sales growth of the interviewed firms, while in Kenya â&#128;&#147;surprisingly, lack of&#13;
access to credit is responsible for around ten percent of the increase in sales growth.&#13;
&#13;
66.    Firm age, on the other hand, is negatively associated with sales growth.&#13;
These associations are significant in Ethiopia and in the group of low-income&#13;
countries, and insignificant in Kenya. This would be in line with what one would&#13;
expect, that the older a firm is and the longer it has been in the market, the less sales&#13;
growth it will experience as revenue will plateau within a captive market. On the&#13;
other hand, and although not the case for all model specifications, firms that operate&#13;
in Ethiopia and that are owned at least in part by foreigners, present a deceleration&#13;
in sales growth of around 20 percentage points indicating that not only do foreign-&#13;
owned firms are less likely to spend on R&amp;D, but also that they have a lower sales&#13;
growth than do firms that are more than 90 percent owned domestically.&#13;
&#13;
67.     Product innovation is not significantly correlated to job creation in any&#13;
of the geographic areas of the study. In table A2.3 the results of the estimations&#13;
wherein employment growth is the dependent variable are presented. While&#13;
spending on R&amp;D is positively correlated with employment growth across all regions,&#13;
it is not clear whether this growth is directly related to additional employees directly&#13;
involved with R&amp;D activities. Finally, process innovation is positively correlated to&#13;
employment growth only in Ethiopia, where it explains 3 percent of the change in&#13;
employment growth, all other things equal.&#13;
&#13;
68.    The rate of employment growth is correlated to firm size. In Ethiopia this&#13;
relationship is negative while positive in the LICs. Thus, the larger a firm is in terms&#13;
of number of employees in Ethiopia, the slower its hiring rates will be, and possibly&#13;
the more jobs it will shed. The opposite occurs in the group of LICs. This further&#13;
suggests that labor in Ethiopia is not operating at full productivity, thus presenting an&#13;
output gap that results in idle employees. Firms in Ethiopia can thus easily cover&#13;
surges in demand, without the need for additional employees, and growth in revenue&#13;
would not necessarily translate into additional job creation. In Kenya, firm size and&#13;
employment growth appear to be independent.&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            39&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
69.    The age of the firm is also correlated with employment growth in&#13;
Ethiopia and in the LICs in a similar fashion as the size of the firm is; that is&#13;
negatively correlated to employment growth in Ethiopia and positively correlated in&#13;
LICs (except for one model specification in which a positive correlation is observed).&#13;
In Ethiopia this too may be connected with the productivity levels: as labor costs are&#13;
inherently low in the country, it is relatively cheap to start a business with excess&#13;
labor capacity. As the firm ages however, some of these extra labor is shed in favor of&#13;
more optimal productivity levels, and absent growth, employment growth rates&#13;
decline or become negative. There appears to be no correlation between the age of a&#13;
firm and employment growth in these model specifications in the case of Kenya.&#13;
&#13;
70.    In Ethiopia, there is a negative correlation between being an exporter&#13;
firm and employment growth rate. This could be due to the fact that exporters tend&#13;
to be more capital intensive than non-exporters, given the fact that most of the export&#13;
portfolio of the country consists on commodities.&#13;
&#13;
71.     There is a positive correlation between labor productivity growth and&#13;
innovation activity. When looking at labor productivity growth in the regression&#13;
analyses, there is a positive correlation of similar magnitudes with product and&#13;
process innovation in both Ethiopia and in Kenya, explaining between 8 and 10&#13;
percent of the change in productivity growth rates (Table A2.4), while spending on&#13;
R&amp;D doesnâ&#128;&#153;t seem to have an impact over labor productivity in either of the two&#13;
countries. None of the three measures of innovation however, appear to be&#13;
significantly correlated with labor productivity growth in the group of LICs. Credit&#13;
constraint is the only control variable that is correlated with labor productivity&#13;
growth, and we find this to be the case in Ethiopia, Kenya and in the LICs. However,&#13;
in Ethiopia and in the LICs, the relationship is negative while in Kenya not only is the&#13;
relationship positive, but the magnitude of the coefficient in fact larger than observed&#13;
on the two other comparators. This suggests that there may be a higher premium to&#13;
credit access in Kenya, causing additional pressure on the productivity of the&#13;
employees in Kenyan enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
5. Summary and Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
72.   Firm level innovation compares less favorably to other comparator&#13;
countries. About a third of the surveyed firms report having introduced new&#13;
products or having improved their production or business processes. However, the&#13;
country performs unfavorably vis-Ã -vis the selected comparators, as the share of&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            40&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
firms that innovate in Ethiopia is about half of the share of the firms that do so in both&#13;
China and Kenya.&#13;
&#13;
73.     Among large firms, the share of firms who do innovate is larger,&#13;
especially in Ethiopia where the figure reaches just under 70 percent. In line with&#13;
this, smaller firms are less likely to spend in research and development, a fact that is&#13;
particularly noticeable in Ethiopia once again, vis-Ã -vis similar countries. Also,&#13;
innovation varies depending on certain firm characteristics, such as the sector in&#13;
which the firm operates.&#13;
&#13;
74.    Ethiopian manufacturing firms are more likely to innovate than service&#13;
firms are. Further, firms in the textile and garment, and in the food sectors seem to&#13;
have a higher prevalence of product and process innovation than firms in other&#13;
sectors.&#13;
&#13;
75.     The quality of the human capital, and the firmâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to invest in&#13;
developing it, are also important for innovation. The analyses conducted shows&#13;
that firms that offer employees training and time to experiment tend to be the firms&#13;
that introduce new products or that develop new production processes or services.&#13;
&#13;
76.      There is no difference between foreign and domestic owned firms in&#13;
Ethiopia, and its likelihood to create new products or new or improved&#13;
processes. One of the arguments advanced in favor of foreign investment is not only&#13;
that it enhances job creation, but also that it facilitates the transfer of technology. That&#13;
doesnâ&#128;&#153;t seem to be the case in Ethiopia, at least based on this data. However, there is&#13;
a high possibility that FDI resulted in a one-off transfer of technology at the time of&#13;
establishment of a subsidiary which is not captured in the data.&#13;
&#13;
77.    Innovation also has a correlation to firm performance. Firms that have&#13;
introduced product or process innovations in Ethiopia show higher sales growth than&#13;
those that have not. Similarly, process innovation and spending on R&amp;D appear to be&#13;
triggers for employment creation in Ethiopia, and finally, the analysis shows that&#13;
process innovation and spending on R&amp;D enhance labor productivity. It is important&#13;
to note however, that all these results are associations, and while they do not&#13;
necessarily indicate a causal impact of innovations on firm performance they can&#13;
enrich future discussions for innovation policy or help guide further research.&#13;

CHAPTER 3: Innovation Landscape in Ethiopia&#13;
This chapter assesses the innovation landscape in Ethiopia, by reviewing the various&#13;
governmental and private agencies responsible to promote innovation, as well as active&#13;
programs, and donor initiatives which may play a role in promoting firm level and pro-&#13;
poor innovations, with the aim to highlight some potential gaps that need to be&#13;
addressed in order to increase innovation led industrial growth.&#13;
&#13;
1. Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s current innovation performance&#13;
&#13;
78.     Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s innovation performance stifles its overall competitiveness.&#13;
According to the World Economic Forumâ&#128;&#153;s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI),&#13;
Ethiopia ranks 109th out of 140 countries with a score of 3.7 out of 7.0 in the 2015-16&#13;
report. The overall score has gradually improved, compared to its performance in&#13;
2013-14 and 2014-15 where it ranked 127th with a score of 3.5 and 118th with a score&#13;
of 3.6, respectively. However, the comparison of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s GCI scores between&#13;
2009-10 and 2015-16 reveals significant improvements in the â&#128;&#156;Macroeconomic&#13;
environmentâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;Health and primary educationâ&#128;&#157; indicators, while progress was&#13;
slow in other areas, including Technological readiness, Business sophistication, and&#13;
Innovation (see Figure 3.1).&#13;
&#13;
                           Figure 3.1: Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s score on GCI&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                  Source: The Global Competitiveness Report 2009-10 and 2015-16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
79.    Although the overall GCI score of innovation increased 0.5 points in the&#13;
past six years (3.2 in 2015-16 from 2.7 in 2009-10), Ethiopia still lags behind in&#13;
Global Benchmarking on key innovation indicators and has room for&#13;
improvement (see Table A3.1 in annex). Even though the global ranking/score&#13;
shows weaknesses and strengths of competitor countries among the selected&#13;
&amp;#12;     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                                42&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
indicators, these countries keep and retain their competitive advantage in certain&#13;
innovation indicators. For instance, while China ranked lower in the indicators under&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Technological Readinessâ&#128;&#157; than the other four competitors, it is ranked higher in the&#13;
indicators â&#128;&#156;State of cluster developmentâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;Company spending on R&amp;Dâ&#128;&#157; as&#13;
compared to others. Development of the innovation capabilities is required to enable&#13;
increased innovation led growth in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
80.    Low level of Technological Readiness is indicative of the fact that modern&#13;
technology and knowledge, which provide economic benefits to the economy,&#13;
are not effectively adapted and utilized. According to the Oslo Manual (OECD,&#13;
2005), â&#128;&#156;an innovation is the implementation of a new or significantly improved product,&#13;
or process, a new marketing method, or a new organizational method in business&#13;
practiceâ&#128;&#157;. These new methods or practices are not necessarily new in absolute&#13;
terms42. In other words, for developing countries such as Ethiopia, acquiring new&#13;
technologies and knowledge plays a crucial role in increasing the competitiveness of&#13;
the business sector and the academic institutions. While these latest technologies and&#13;
knowledge are usually brought into the country through direct purchase from&#13;
overseas and technology transfer to domestic firms through FDI, the GCI rankings&#13;
show the lack of adoption and utilization of these in Ethiopia (Table 3.1).&#13;
&#13;
81.    In addition, â&#128;&#156;Business Sophisticationâ&#128;&#157;, which encourages and increases&#13;
efficient production of goods and services, needs to be improved. The quality of&#13;
a countryâ&#128;&#153;s business networks and supporting industries, as measured by the&#13;
quantity and quality of local suppliers and the extent of their interconnection (value&#13;
chain breadth), are regarded as important factors to foster innovation. Despite its&#13;
importance, Ethiopia is ranked poorly in these indicators. In particular, the quantity&#13;
and quality of local suppliers are ranked 127th and 125th out of 140 countries.&#13;
&#13;
82.     Adequate private sector R&amp;D spending and the quality of scientific&#13;
research intuitions as well as scientists and engineers are critical to increase&#13;
Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s innovative capabilities. The score of key innovation indicators showed&#13;
a significant improvement in the GCI 2015-16 report, compared to that of GCI 2014-&#13;
15 report. In the GCI 2015-16 report, â&#128;&#156;quality of scientific research intuitionsâ&#128;&#157;,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;company spending on R&amp;Dâ&#128;&#157;, and â&#128;&#156;availability of scientists and engineersâ&#128;&#157; indicators&#13;
were scored at 3.6, 3.5, and 3.8, respectively43, while these indicators in the GCI 2014-&#13;
15 report were 3.1, 2.6, and 3.3. This is considered a good trend, but it is also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
42   World Bank (2010)&#13;
43   These improvements were achieved partially because of the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s investment in R&amp;D.&#13;

                                                                                                43&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
important for the Government and relevant institutions to further strengthen the&#13;
foundations that support the innovation capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s current investment in innovation (R&amp;D)&#13;
&#13;
83.     The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s expenditure on R&amp;D has significantly increased. From&#13;
2010 to 2013, Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s spending on R&amp;D, increased from 931.3 million ETB to&#13;
5,242.6 million ETB (see Table 3.1). As such, the share of R&amp;D spending as a share of&#13;
GDP has increased from 0.24 percent to 0.61 percent. Ethiopia is thus well positioned&#13;
to achieve one percent of GDP share of R&amp;D spending, a target which was endorsed&#13;
by the 2006 Executive Council of the Africa Union on Science and Technology held in&#13;
Khartoum to introduce and foster innovation in African countries. Although&#13;
Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s R&amp;D spending to GDP share is smaller than competitor countries, its 2013&#13;
R&amp;D spending is similar to the level of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s R&amp;D spending in 2006 and South&#13;
Africaâ&#128;&#153;s R&amp;D spending in 2010 (see Figure 3.2).&#13;

84.    Increase in the R&amp;D budget was a result of the increased headcount of&#13;
R&amp;D personnel44 and not researchers. In 2013, about three-fourth (74.1 percent)&#13;
of Government spending was allocated to higher education, and 24.5 percent went to&#13;
government institutionâ&#128;&#153;s R&amp;D activities. The number of R&amp;D personnel in the country&#13;
has increased to 18,435 in 2013, which is approximately a 41 percent increase,&#13;
compared to 13,095 in 2010, according to the 2014 Science Technology Information&#13;
Center Report. Meanwhile, the percentage of the number of researchers45 that&#13;
increased during the same period was about 13 percent (from 7,283 to 8,218). This&#13;
&#13;
44 R&amp;D Personnel are all persons employed directly on R&amp;D (researchers, technicians and equivalent staff), as&#13;
well as those providing direct services such as R&amp;D managers, administrators, and clerical staff.&#13;
45 Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes,&#13;
&#13;
methods and systems and also in the management of the projects concerned (UNESCO Institute for Statistics)&#13;

                                                                                                44&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
implies that the majority of the increase of R&amp;D personnel was on account of the&#13;
increase of personnel other than researchers.&#13;
&#13;
85.     In addition, the increase in R&amp;D spending can be explained by the rapid&#13;
expansion of the higher education sector and the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s continued&#13;
investment in research institutions, but coordination is critical to use the&#13;
limited budget effectively. Since 2000, Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s higher education sector has grown&#13;
from three public universities to 22 public universities by 201146. At present, there&#13;
are 35 public universities47. Many of the new public universities are located in rural&#13;
areas, and it often requires new investment both in R&amp;D personnel and facilities.&#13;
Moreover, the government has continued providing investment in agricultural&#13;
research, given the fact that agriculture is still the major source of national income.&#13;
The main governmental agricultural research institute, the Ethiopian Institute of&#13;
Agricultural Research (EIAR) has increased its federal research centers from 13 (in&#13;
2011) to 16 (as of today). Increasing the number of graduates from universities and&#13;
researchers at research institutes is a key component of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s development&#13;
with skilled personnel. At the same time, however, these efforts will be in vain, if&#13;
effective quality assurance of education and research is not implemented.&#13;
&#13;
86.    On the other hand, business sector spending on R&amp;D has sharply&#13;
declined. Contrary to higher education and government institutions, the R&amp;D&#13;
spending by business sector has decreased from 144.6 million ETB to 61.5 million&#13;
ETB during the same period, which accounts for only 1.2 percent of the total R&amp;D&#13;
spending in 2013. Given increased global competition, success of Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s industrial&#13;
sector depends on the firmsâ&#128;&#153; ability to innovate48.&#13;
&#13;
Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s Current Research Strengths&#13;
&#13;
87.    Ethiopia ranks 80th out of 239 countries on the measure of scientific&#13;
influence of academic journals. According to SCImago Journal &amp; Country database,&#13;
which takes into account the number of research articles, total number of citable&#13;
documents, number of citations and self-citations, citations per document published&#13;
and h-index49 , Ethiopia ranks 80th, while China, Turkey, South Africa, and Kenya are&#13;
ranked 2nd, 20th, 35th, and 67th, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
46 Ashcroft and Rayner (2012)&#13;
47 According to website of Ministry of Education (MoE), 31 universities are owned by the MoE plus the Ethiopian&#13;
Civil Service University, Defense University College, Kotebe College of teacher education, and Telecommunications&#13;
and IT College. Also, here were 59 accredited non-government universities or colleges awarding degrees.&#13;

received in other publications. The index can also be applied to the productivity and impact of a group of scientists,&#13;
such as a department or university or country, as well as a scholarly journal.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
88.    Ethiopia has strengths in two specific research fields which could serve&#13;
as the basis for strengthening R&amp;D and applying it towards sectoral&#13;
development. In terms of research specification (see Figure 3.3), Ethiopian science,&#13;
as measured with quantity and quality of scientific output (i.e., number of citable&#13;
documents, citations and h-index) appears to perform well in the following areas:&#13;
Medicine and Agricultural and Biological Sciences. Medicine accounts for&#13;
approximately 25 percent of academic journals produced by Ethiopia in 2011-12,&#13;
while Agricultural and Biological Sciences accounts for about 20 percent. Major&#13;
subjects that are written in Medicine are: infectious diseases; and public health,&#13;
environmental and occupational health. Under Agricultural and Biological Sciences,&#13;
agronomy and crop science and animal science and zoology are leading subjects.&#13;
Given the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic conditions, the health and agricultural sectors are&#13;
considered primary areas in which advanced research could provide substantial&#13;
benefits to the society at large.&#13;

2. Enabling Environment - Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s Policy:&#13;
&#13;
89.   The Government of Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to establish an enabling&#13;
environment for innovation have been initiated more than two decades ago, but&#13;
&amp;#12;     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                                46&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
its weak implementation has deterred its effective establishment. The national&#13;
Science and Technology (S&amp;T) policy of the country was originally adopted by the&#13;
transitional Government of Ethiopia in 1993 to boost innovation activities for&#13;
economic development through the application of science and technology50. The S&amp;T&#13;
policy served to provide general directions to guide scientific and technological&#13;
activities for innovation. However, the policy was not properly implemented, due to&#13;
the fact that it was not followed up by detailed implementation of strategies and&#13;
programs aimed at achieving the envisaged policy objectives. Also, there was no&#13;
strong and legitimate body that could coordinate the use of limited resources among&#13;
key stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
90.     Recognizing the important role and the urgent need for innovation to&#13;
increase the countryâ&#128;&#153;s sustainable development, Ethiopia adopted a new&#13;
Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy in February 201251. The STI&#13;
policy envisaged the establishment of a national innovation system that would&#13;
support the building of a sound science and technology foundation in technological&#13;
learning, adaptation, utilization, and creation through searching, selecting and&#13;
importing effective foreign technologies in manufacturing and service providing&#13;
enterprises. In addition, the Government has developed the STI policy&#13;
implementation strategy which supports the implementation of strategies envisioned&#13;
in the GTP.&#13;
&#13;
91.     The new STI policy has identified direction and major strategies under&#13;
11 critical policy areas that the government intends to support. Based on the&#13;
analysis conducted by the government, the identified areas include the followings: i)&#13;
technology transfer; ii) human resource development; iii) manufacturing and service&#13;
providing enterprises; iv) research; v) financing and incentive schemes; vi) national&#13;
quality infrastructure development; vii) universities, research institutes, Technical&#13;
and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions and industries linkage;&#13;
viii) intellectual property system; ix) science and technology information; x)&#13;
environmental development and protection; and xi) international cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
92.    The implementation of the STI policy is crucial to facilitate linkages&#13;
between different actors and institutions involved in the innovation ecosystem.&#13;
While it is true that key changes in society are brought on by innovation deriving from&#13;
science and research efforts, innovation driven by sources other than science and&#13;
&#13;
50Ethiopian Science and Technology Agency (2006)&#13;

research also have a considerable impact on the origin of new industries, jobs, and&#13;
incomes52. Figure 3.4 shows the various actors and institutions relevant to the policy&#13;
areas envisioned in the STI policy. The key actors are structured into three broad&#13;
stakeholder categories namely: public sector; academic institutions; and industry.&#13;
The public sector, include government and its relevant agencies, support the import,&#13;
adoption, and creation of innovation knowledge and goods and services. Academic&#13;
institutions, including researcher, scientists and engineers affiliated with universities&#13;
and research institutions generate innovative knowledge, while industry, including&#13;
large corporation, SMEs, and start-up companies, produce goods and services.&#13;
Furthermore, academic institutions and industry would need to collaborate to&#13;
introduce and create new innovations that contribute to increased industrial&#13;
productivity.&#13;

93.    Although the policy specifies a major set of directions and strategies, the&#13;
inclusion of the BoP into the nationâ&#128;&#153;s innovation system needs to put in place.&#13;
While Ethiopia achieved rapid economic growth with an average of 10 percent per&#13;
year during the last decade, the country remains the ninth poorest country in the&#13;
world (in income per capita), leaving about 30 percent of the population who live&#13;

below the national poverty line. 66 percent of the population comprise the BoP&#13;
subsisting on less than USD2.0 a day. In 2013, approximately 83 percent of the&#13;
population was living in rural areas, where income generation is mainly from&#13;
agriculture relying on limited land. The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s focus on improved linkages&#13;
among various actors under STI can create a foundation of innovation which&#13;
contributes to job creation, social development, and export promotion for the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s growth. However, this will not be achieved without addressing the need for&#13;
improved access to services and improved quality of life for the BoP. Potential areas&#13;
of intervention on inclusive innovation are included in Table 3.2.&#13;

&#13;
94.      Inclusive innovation is important to address the needs of the BoP. In&#13;
particular, innovative solutions, such as using advanced technologies, can contribute&#13;
to filling the shortfalls in critical areas of education, health and social safety net&#13;
services in rural Ethiopia. Several attempts have been initiated by the government to&#13;
provide better access to public service to the BoP by using technologies such as&#13;
mobile phone, laptop, tablet, and other ICT tools.&#13;
&#13;
95.     To deliver quality education in all regions of the country, ICT has been&#13;
one of the priority areas for the education sector. Funded in part by the United&#13;
Nations Development Program (UNDP), the government has introduced broadband&#13;
connections to all government secondary schools in the country in order to provide&#13;
nationally broadcasted lessons of about 45 minutes. This approach addresses the&#13;
issues of access by enabling the students to use the same material and standards at&#13;
all government schools, regardless of their geographic location. It is important to&#13;
highlight the need for the content used in these materials to be produced keeping&#13;
international standards in mind. Furthermore, the One Laptop per Child (OLPC)&#13;
initiative piloted in Ethiopia revealed immediate improvements in the classroom&#13;
environment mostly through the utilization of e-books, while showing significant&#13;
potential to expand both media and computer literacy among students.&#13;
&#13;
96.    As with the education sector, ICT in the health sector has also&#13;
contributed to improving the healthcare delivery for the BoP. Using ICT in supply&#13;
chain management allows hospitals and clinics to keep sufficient supplies and&#13;
medicines by monitoring the number in the system. Moreover, the government has&#13;
supported telemedicine as a tool to provide primary healthcare services to remote&#13;
areas. Health extension workers in distant posts can access health information&#13;
systems remotely and connect with health professionals and receive information and&#13;
assistance to diagnose, treat and refer patients. The patient data can also be collected&#13;
by using mobile phones and tablet for records.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       Box 3.1: Productive Safety Net Program&#13;
                 â&#128;&#147; using electronic payment system for cash transfer â&#128;&#147;&#13;
  The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) is a multi- donor financed program, started&#13;
  with the aim of shifting focus away from short-term food needs met through emergency&#13;
  relief to addressing the underlying causes of household food-insecurity. PSNP IV is the&#13;
  fourth phase of the program with an objective to increase access to safety net and&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            50&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  disaster risk management systems, complementary livelihoods services and nutrition&#13;
  support for food insecure households in rural Ethiopia.&#13;
  Under the Program, the government had initiated a pilot program to use electronic&#13;
  payment systems to reach to PSNP beneficiaries who did not have access to financial&#13;
  services. The electronic payment system required an appropriate technological&#13;
  platform which could be used by the selected Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs)&#13;
  enrolled in the Program.&#13;
  The pilot of the electronic payment system targeted Oromia region, with a total of&#13;
  52,000 beneficiaries. An evaluation of the pilot found that the electronic payments&#13;
  increased the security and speed of the payment system, with 99% of participants in&#13;
  the pilot reporting that the electronic payment system was safer and more secure than&#13;
  the traditional manual payment system.&#13;
  In addition to increasing security and reliability of transfers, the pilot also revealed&#13;
  several other positive results, including increased financial literacy and savings&#13;
  amongst beneficiaries. This was achieved, since they became more familiar with&#13;
  financial institutions through the mobile transfer process. The pilot also noted the&#13;
  significant cost savings that could be realized from an electronic transfer system, which&#13;
  would eliminate the need for extensive staffing and local intermediaries. The estimated&#13;
  cost per transaction of a scalable electronic payment system would be less than 2% of&#13;
  the amount of each transfer, representing significant savings over the current manual&#13;
  transfer system.&#13;
  Several challenges were also observed during the pilot phase, including the limited&#13;
  availability of telecom coverage in rural Ethiopia and the need to develop a sustainable&#13;
  business model that is profitable and makes sense for financial institutions and&#13;
  technology providers. Based on the largely positive results of the pilot, discussion are&#13;
  underway with mobile money provider to further expand the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
97.    A functional organizational structure is required to implement the STI&#13;
policy. The STI policy covers a broad range of areas, government needs to have a&#13;
strong and legitimate body that can mobilize the relevant ministries. Currently, the&#13;
main actors of innovation system are the National Science, Technology and&#13;
Innovation Council (NSTIC), Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST), and other&#13;
related ministries. To facilitate the efficient development of the national innovation&#13;
system, these main actors require a clear mandate and increased capacity for policy&#13;
implementation. The key roles of these main actors are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   National Science, Technology and Innovation Council. According to the&#13;
       policy, the council is the highest decision making body for the STI policy and&#13;
       is chaired by the Prime Minister. Participation and active engagement from all&#13;
       key ministers, along with top representatives of the business, academic, and&#13;

                                                                                                51&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           civil society are required. The council is focused on developing strategic&#13;
           policies, priority setting and policy coordination which are articulated in the&#13;
           STI policy. The Councilâ&#128;&#153;s long-term focus reduces inconsistencies in&#13;
           policymaking generated by the political cycle and the subsequent short-term&#13;
           horizon of many policy decisions.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Ministry of Science and Technology. MoST serves as a secretariat of the&#13;
           NSTIC, and it has the overall responsibility of coordinating, supporting,&#13;
           monitoring STI development activities based on the strategic decisions made&#13;
           at the NSTIC. MoST plays a pivotal role in the implementation of the STI policy,&#13;
           together with other respective ministries. Also, the Science and Technology&#13;
           Information Center, established in 2011, will play an important role in&#13;
           collecting and disseminating the information gathered.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Other ministers and relevant governmental agencies. It should be noted&#13;
           that all science and technology related ministries and their relevant agencies&#13;
           have significant roles to play in the national innovation system through their&#13;
           active involvement in human resource development, research, and technology&#13;

           Development; Ministry of Industry; Ministry of Trade; Ministry of Agriculture;&#13;
           Ministry of Health; Ministry of Education; Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs;&#13;
           Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, etc.&#13;
&#13;
98.    Given the complex organizational arrangements involving various&#13;
stakeholders, strong political leadership is critical to facilitate communication&#13;
and collaboration to implement the STI policy. While the current organizational&#13;
structure is in line with international practice, key lessons learned from global&#13;
experiences emphasize the importance of inter-ministries and inter-agency bodies&#13;
creating a coordinated and coherent implementation of STI-policies. These lessons&#13;
include: (i) involvement of the right people with the needed qualities (experienced,&#13;
and both knowledgeable on content and process) at implementing/coordinating&#13;
body; (ii) fairly broad mandates for implementing/coordinating body to enhance&#13;
coordination between the various actors involved; and (iii) early identification of&#13;
cross departmental themes in order to keep the interdepartmental agenda fulfilled53.&#13;

3. Industry-Research Linkages - Effectiveness of academic and research&#13;
   institutions&#13;
&#13;
99.    Successful implementation of STI activities also depends on the&#13;
effectiveness of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s academic institutions: universities; research&#13;
institutes; TVET institutions; and industry development institutes (e.g. Leather&#13;
Industries Development Institute, Textile Industries Development Institute, etc.).&#13;
Strong leadership led by Ethiopian academic institutions plays a central role in&#13;
establishing and strengthening the linkages with industry. Effective and well&#13;
organized linkages between academic institutions and industry would help Ethiopia&#13;
transform its economy from an agricultural led to a knowledge-based industrial led.&#13;
For industry, in spite of the fact that integration of innovation into products and&#13;
services is critical for their existence and competitiveness, they are often reluctant to&#13;
invest their own resources into activities related to innovation, as the result of&#13;
acquired innovation is uncertain.&#13;
&#13;
100. Effective and efficient linkages between academic institution and&#13;
industry, which contribute to increased industrial productivity have not been&#13;
established in Ethiopia. A critical misalignment exists between the research outputs&#13;
from academic institutions and the technology needs of industry54. Cooperation with&#13;
industry is important for academic institutions to create scientific and innovative&#13;
knowledge and address solutions that address industry needs. Research conducted&#13;
by academic institutions could increase agricultural productivity and expand&#13;
investment in the industrial sector (particularly in small and micro enterprises of&#13;
manufacturing industry). These in turn could increase economic growth by providing&#13;
solutions for the BoP population. Industry-research linkages can vary ranging from&#13;
joint research and consultancy services, to creating opportunities for student&#13;
internships, staff exchanges, and curriculum development for students.&#13;
&#13;
Public Universities&#13;
&#13;
101. There has been a steady increase in the number of universities in&#13;
Ethiopia. Currently, there are 31 public and approximately 80 private universities in&#13;
Ethiopia. The rapid increase of the number of universities is accompanied by a huge&#13;
increase in student numbers, teaching staff and administrative personnel. While in&#13;
2000 only a few thousand students had a chance to receive a university degree,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
54Working paper prepared by Open African Innovation Research &amp; Training in 2012. Also, situation analysis of&#13;
research activity at Addis Ababa University found that none of the units at the university had set research&#13;
priorities based on national development objectives (Lemma 2008).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
mostly at Addis Ababa University (AAU)55, more than 500,000 students were enrolled&#13;
in public universities in 2012/13.&#13;
&#13;
102. Some government initiatives that were carried out to facilitate the&#13;
university-industry linkage in the past were not continued, due mainly to the&#13;
lack of financial support. These initiatives include: i) the cooperation program&#13;
between AAU and the Ministry of Industry (1986- 1991), which focused on research&#13;
relevant to industry and provided university generated technologies and training to&#13;
industry; and ii) establishment of Technology Faculty - Industry Linkage Unit under&#13;
Faculty of Technology of AAU in 2000, which provided research, training, and&#13;
consultancy services to industry. However, these programs were discontinued when&#13;
governmentâ&#128;&#153;s financial support was terminated.&#13;
&#13;
103. Recent positive fundamental change undertaken by the government was&#13;
the establishment of Technology Transfer Office (TTO)56 in the reformed or&#13;
newly established Institute of Technology (IoT) across the country. University&#13;
Capacity Building Program (UCBP)57 supports the setting up of IoTs in Ethiopia by&#13;
converting the Engineering and Technology Faculty of the existing universities or&#13;
establishing new IoTs. While remaining accountable to the university, IoTs are&#13;
considered as autonomous units which have flexibility in their budgets and programs.&#13;
More importantly, the IoTs are allowed to use any unused funds from the State on a&#13;
rolling basis, and are allowed to generate revenue from various income activities for&#13;
their own purposes, which increase the sustainability of the programs. Under the&#13;
organizational structure of IoTs, there are TTOs which are responsible for leading&#13;
direct linkage with industry. Selected IoTs established under the UCBP are as shown&#13;
in Table 3.3.&#13;

 Institute of Textile and Fashion Technology (iOTEX) of Bahir Dar University is the only&#13;
 higher education institution in Ethiopia focused on the level of 'Institute of Technology'&#13;
 to educate specialized professionals in the field of textile, garment and fashion design&#13;
 in the country.&#13;
 The iOTEX Institute has a history of more than 40 years. Currently, more than 1,300&#13;
 students are receiving education through five undergraduate Programs (Fashion&#13;
 Design, Garment Engineering, Textile Engineering, Technical and Vocational Education&#13;
 and Training (TVET) in Textile Engineering, TVET in Garment Engineering), and one&#13;
 graduate programs (Textile Technology).&#13;
 The Government of Ethiopia has identified the textile and garment industry as a priority&#13;
 industry keeping in view its potential as an engine that generates employment&#13;
 opportunities, import substitution, export earnings, and easy linkages to pursuing the&#13;
 Agriculture Development Led Industrialization Strategy for the development of the&#13;
 country.&#13;
 However, the major challenges hampering the competitiveness of the Ethiopian textile&#13;
 and garment sector are:&#13;
 - Lack of sufficient raw materials;&#13;
 - Lack of Qualified Human Resources;&#13;
 - Low quality and productivity;&#13;
 - Unsatisfactory product development capability;&#13;
 - Lack of strategic company and production management philosophies; and&#13;
 - Lack of Sustainability&#13;
 To address these issues, the following measures have been put in place.&#13;
 1) Involvement of industry professionals in restructuring the curriculum at iOTEX - All&#13;
    programs in the institute were developed in response to industry needs.&#13;
 2) Establishment of Student Industrial Internship through Institute â&#128;&#147; Industry Linkage&#13;
    Office for one semester in all curriculums. This helps the student to understand the reality&#13;
    of different kinds of work and allows them to apply what they have learnt.&#13;
 3) Established Institute â&#128;&#147; Industry Linkage Office (Technology Transfer Office) to:&#13;
    coordinate the work of student internships; establish a strong relationship between&#13;

           industries and the institute for their common benefits; identify core problems of the&#13;
           textile and garment industries and research areas through interns and mobilizing iOTEX&#13;
           staff members to tackle these problems.&#13;
      Some results from the iOTEXâ&#128;&#153;s initiative include the establishment of partnership with&#13;
      Bahir Dar and Kombolcha Textile Share Company, state owned fabric manufacturing&#13;
      company established in 1961. The company faced some problems, including low&#13;
      capacity in management, lack of technical and marketing professionals and a lack of&#13;
      maintenance personnel.&#13;
      The first initiative for student internship and research collaboration started in 2011.&#13;
      Through the collaboration, iOTEX estimated that the company could save as much as&#13;
      ETB 10 million/year to ETB 30,493,769 /year only with the implementation of simple&#13;
      changes.&#13;

104. While university-industry linkages has gradually begun in Ethiopia, new&#13;
initiatives to strengthen the direct linkages with industry have been initiated.&#13;
These are: technology business incubation at AAU and the establishment of Research&#13;
Park planned by Adama Science and Technology University58. The objectives of these&#13;
initiatives are to strengthen the local economy through enhanced knowledge and&#13;
technology transfer from university research to the industry.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Addis Ababa University â&#128;&#147; Technology Business Incubation:&#13;
           In 2012, the first Technology Business Incubation was launched as a pilot&#13;
           program at AAU and admitted a few entrepreneurs from the university. In&#13;
           2015, AAU is planning to expand its program by increasing the number of&#13;
           entrepreneurs (from AAU academic staff and students) who will receive&#13;
           comprehensive incubation support at Technology Business Incubation Center.&#13;
           The main activity is classified into the following three: pre-incubation&#13;
           activities; activities during incubation; and post-incubation activities59.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Adama Science and Technology University (ASTU) â&#128;&#147; Research Park:&#13;
           With the support of University of Leipzig and Conoscope GmbH, ASTU is&#13;
           setting up a Research Park in Ethiopia. According to ASTU, the Research Park&#13;
           is intended to be an important mechanism for the interaction between&#13;
           academia and industry in terms of transferring academic research findings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
58 Establishing a strong tie with German institutions since its inauguration in May 2006 as Adama University, it&#13;
has established strengthening on training students in engineering, technology and applied sciences. The&#13;
Ministry of Education has nominated the university as Center for Excellence in Technology in 2008.&#13;

           other value addition services.&#13;
&#13;
105. Rapid expansion also brings several challenges to universities. University&#13;
and research infrastructure has not expanded in response to the increase in the&#13;
student numbers. Despite the construction of new buildings there is a shortage of&#13;
suitable classrooms and laboratories. Academic staff, particularly in new public&#13;
universities, are very young and are often found to be underqualified. Department&#13;
heads hold Bachelor or Master degrees only, and in one exceptional case a PhD.&#13;
Freshly graduated Bachelors or Masters or even current Master students are&#13;
employed as instructors or teachers60. One of the other issues that prevents qualified&#13;
personnel from entering the academic profession is the low salary scales for academic&#13;
staff leading to low levels of motivation amongst academics. Finally, academia do not&#13;
have the incentives to closely interact with industry implying that their research is&#13;
often not linked to the industrial needs and on the other hand, industry does not&#13;
recognize the potential resource academia can bring to firm capabilities and needs.&#13;
&#13;
Agricultural Research Institutes&#13;
&#13;
106. Significant public efforts have been made in the Agricultural sector.&#13;
Recognizing the agricultural sector as a key economic engine to transform Ethiopia&#13;
into an industrial led economy and to support the BoP population, the Government&#13;
has made significant public efforts in the agricultural sector. Agriculture is the major&#13;
source of livelihood for the majority of Ethiopians, and it contributes to&#13;
approximately 40 percent to the national GDP and employed over 80 percent of the&#13;
population in 2013/14. Since the 1990s, the Government has been implementing&#13;
agriculture support programs through various strategies: notably; the adoption of the&#13;
Agricultural Development Led Industrialization Strategy in 1994; the Plan for&#13;
Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (2005-2010); and the&#13;
Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP, 2010-2015).&#13;
&#13;
107. Innovation plays a critical role in addressing issues facing Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
agricultural sector, dominated by small-scale farmers with low productivity. In&#13;
spite of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s continuous commitment to the development of the sector,&#13;
there is still large room to improve its productivity, production processes and market&#13;
linkages. By recognizing the importance of innovative technology to support the&#13;
growth of the agricultural sector, the Government has invested in the development of&#13;
the National Agricultural Research System, which is comprised of the Ethiopian&#13;
Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR), Regional Agricultural Research Institutes&#13;

     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(RARIs) and Universities/Higher Learning Institutions (HLIs). The research outputs&#13;
vary from improved agronomic and protection practices that can be used in crop&#13;
diversification and specialization for both traditional food crops, to introducing high&#13;
value crops such as vegetables, spices and other horticultural crops61. The&#13;
Government established the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) to support&#13;
the introduction of innovative technologies into the agricultural sector (Box A3.1 in&#13;
annex).&#13;
&#13;
108. Total number of public agricultural researchers has grown significantly&#13;
since 2000. While the number of full-time researchers at government agricultural&#13;
institutions was 743 in 2000, the number increased to 1,410 personnel in 2008 and&#13;
1,876 personnel in 2011. This number is very high compared to neighboring&#13;
countries such as Kenya (1,150), Uganda (353), and Tanzania (814). According to the&#13;
Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI 2014)62, Ethiopia is considered&#13;
to have one of the fastest-growing pools of agricultural researchers in Africa. The&#13;
rapid increase has been due to both the increase in the number of universities in the&#13;
country which have faculty in agriculture and the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s decentralization of&#13;
the agricultural research system from the mid-1990s, which resulted in the&#13;
establishment of RARI administrated by regional state governments.&#13;
&#13;
109. Several initiatives, which adopt and introduce innovation to increase&#13;
agricultural productivity, have been implemented. These typically include:&#13;
research, product introduction, rural infrastructure, education, improving quality of&#13;
inputs, improving land property rights or land distribution, etc. The key initiatives&#13;
that have been introduced in Ethiopia are mainly structured around the following&#13;
areas: product innovation; process innovation; and knowledge innovation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Box 3.3: Pocket sensors for precision agriculture â&#128;&#147; Product Innovation&#13;
      A new pocket-sized sensor could bring precision agriculture within the reach of&#13;
      smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. Precision agriculture&#13;
      uses data from high-tech observations to assess and&#13;
      address crop variability and help farmers to employ&#13;
      their resources more effectively.&#13;
      Crop performance readings from satellite or sensor-&#13;

&#13;
 handheld crop sensor reads near-infrared and red light reflected from plants to&#13;
 measure photosynthesis rates and crop vigor. When used with the normalized&#13;
 difference vegetation index, the readings can help farmers decide exactly how much&#13;
 nitrogen fertilizer to apply to get the best yields.&#13;
 This is especially important in Ethiopia whose soils â&#128;&#147; like those in many parts of Africa&#13;
 â&#128;&#147; typically lack nitrogen, a highly mobile element whose availability is affected by&#13;
 rainfall and soil characteristics. At a cost of about US$500, the sensor could make&#13;
 precision agriculture affordable for farmers in Ethiopia. It does not have the accuracy&#13;
 of bigger sensors, but is less expensive and better adapted to smallholder&#13;
 circumstances.&#13;
 Because most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa import fertilizer, this input is relatively&#13;
 expensive. On average, farmers in the region apply only 9 kg/ha of nitrogen fertilizer,&#13;
 compared to an average of 100 kg/ha in South Asia or more than 70 kg/ha in Latin&#13;
 America. This greatly limits their crop yields. When farmers do apply fertilizer, most&#13;
 follow broadly-targeted application rates recommended by extension agents, rather&#13;
 than site- or season-specific rates that would make the best use of this costly input to&#13;
 raise crop yields.&#13;
 CIMMYT agronomists with the Nutritious Maize for Africa project, funded by the&#13;
 Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD, formerly CIDA) of&#13;
 Canada, have introduced handheld sensors in Ethiopia and are testing them with&#13;
 agronomists from the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR).&#13;

&#13;
            Box 3.4: Household Irrigation Help Line â&#128;&#147; Process Innovation&#13;
 Typically, extension information is cascaded through various levels of the extension&#13;
 systems before reaching its intended recipient. For example, agronomic information is&#13;
 developed and crafted by the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research and the&#13;
 federal Ministry of Agriculture for use by smallholder farmers. This information is then&#13;
 passed down to regional, zonal and woreda staff during annual training sessions. The&#13;
 information will then be delivered to Development Agents (DAs), who will eventually&#13;
 disseminate it to smallholder farmers at training meetings. This modality is often&#13;
 stretched out over the course of 6-9 months, with many instances when the intended&#13;
 information may never actually reach the smallholder farmer.&#13;
 In order to enhance the existing approach, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and ATA&#13;
 have come up with an inventive way of distributing information to smallholder&#13;
 farmers. The Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and Short Message Service (SMS)&#13;
 system is a technology that will allow individuals to call into a hotline and access a wide&#13;
 range of relevant agronomic information. Through the IVR/SMS system, once the&#13;
 information has been agreed upon and uploaded, smallholders and DAs will have direct&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   access to the pertinent agronomic content whenever it is needed. Users will be able to&#13;
   access pre-recorded messages, in a wide range of languages, at their own convenience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Distributing agricultural extension materials can be costly and time consuming;&#13;
   however, through this new system, information will be available around the clock.&#13;
   Once the content has been agreed upon, it will be available for anyone to access. Based&#13;
   on the userâ&#128;&#153;s responses to various prompts, and information they enter using their&#13;
   keypads, the user will get specific, tailored agronomic information, in local languages&#13;
   they can understand, thus supplementing the training provided by DAs in the&#13;
   traditional approach.&#13;
   During 2013, this mobile based IVR/SMS system was piloted with smallholder farmers&#13;
   engaged in irrigated agriculture (more details in the Special Projects section of this&#13;
   Annual Report). Based on this success, the ATA and MoA have begun to scale up this&#13;
   approach to all farmers in Ethiopia.&#13;

110. There is an important role for Government interventions to support&#13;
agricultural innovation adoption. While there have been various efforts made by&#13;
government research institutes to support smallholder farmers to adopt innovative&#13;
technologies, all innovation adoption decisions are typically influenced by the&#13;
farmersâ&#128;&#153; individual risk preferences and their ability to bear the risk of a new and&#13;
uncertain endeavor. They require certain guarantees that their future access to land,&#13;
inputs and outputs will not be a point of uncertainty. Without some level of assurance&#13;
that their access to future benefits is not at risk, farmers have little incentive to invest&#13;
their time, labor and capital into technology adoption.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢    Farmerâ&#128;&#153;s adoption rates of improved seeds are low. While Ethiopian seed&#13;
        research is quite established and has released hundreds of new varieties,&#13;
        farmer adoption rates of improved seeds - even in reliable rain fed areas - are&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            60&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        low. Around 12 to 15 percent of farmers use improved wheat and maize; less&#13;
        than 1 percent of farmers use improved seed for teff, barley, and sorghum&#13;
        (International Food Policy Research Institute 2010).&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢    The availability of financial services is very much associated with the&#13;
        capacity of smallholders and emerging commercial farmers to adopt&#13;
        improved agricultural practices. Access to credit or finance is considered a&#13;
        major constraint in adopting almost all types of innovative technologies&#13;
        (Tiwari 2010, Olaleye 2005, Doss et al. 2003 on production technologies). This&#13;
        includes both short term seasonal credit for crop inputs and medium-longer&#13;
        term finance for capital investments.&#13;
&#13;
111. In order to transform Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s farmers, in particular smallholder&#13;
farmers, into innovative and market oriented producers, strengthening the&#13;
value chain is critical. The core assumption behind â&#128;&#152;pro-poorâ&#128;&#153; value chain&#13;
interventions is that vulnerable upstream agents (such as smallholder farmers) can&#13;
be â&#128;&#152;pulledâ&#128;&#153; into specific markets, and therefore successfully integrated into economic&#13;
dynamics from which they were excluded, or, at best, only participated under very&#13;
unfavorable conditions. To service the end market downstream actors need to secure&#13;
a regular supply of produce from upstream smallholders. This requires processors,&#13;
traders or exporters to invest in the upstream supply side of the chain in order to&#13;
secure desired products in the right quantity and quality. Such investments may&#13;
include sharing market intelligence with farmers or providing them with specific&#13;
services including technical, financial and organizational services.&#13;

  The objective of the Wheat Program is to support significant and sustainable increases&#13;
  in the productivity and incomes of smallholder farmers producing the crop, through&#13;
  the promotion of several key interventions, including access to high quality seeds and&#13;
  fertilizers, training in new and better agronomic practices (i.e., planting in rows with&#13;
  the appropriate seed rate), more efficient post-harvest processing and handling by&#13;
  using agricultural machineries, and access to financing resources. The program further&#13;

      aims to support the growth of efficient, sizeable, and sustainable markets to help&#13;
      farmers convert their increased production into additional income.&#13;
      As has now been demonstrated by many farmers in various regions of the country,&#13;
      wheatâ&#128;&#153;s national average yield can be easily doubled simply by improving agronomic&#13;
      practices, providing improved access to technologies, and addressing market&#13;
      problems, such as the price difference between local wheat and subsidized imports. In&#13;
      2013, 400,000 farmers were targeted for productivity enhancing training and support.&#13;

112. Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural sector continues to face challenges. The&#13;
development of Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector has been supported by the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
strong commitment; however, rapid expansion of the supporting system is&#13;
confronted with challenges to maintain its quality. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s research system&#13;
relies on highly skilled professionals to identify, test, and avail of innovative&#13;
technologies and techniques that can help Ethiopian farmers grow a higher volume&#13;
of better agricultural commodities more efficiently. However, this system has&#13;
suffered from systemic and operational bottlenecks.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Quality of researchers. Although the total number of researchers employed&#13;
           at governmental institutions has dramatically increased, many of the new&#13;
           recruits are young and only trained to the BSc level (Table 3.4). As of 2011,&#13;
           according to ASTI 2014, more than half the countryâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural researchers&#13;
           held BSc degree, and 48 percent were under 31 years old. Also, the share of&#13;
           PhD researchers is significantly low, compared to the neighboring countries63.&#13;

&#13;
   â&#128;¢   High Staff Turnover. Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural research system has suffered&#13;
       from high staff attrition rates, negatively impacting the quality of the work and&#13;
       its potential to positively contribute to the transformation of the agricultural&#13;
       sector as a whole. The primary reasons for the high turnover rates have been&#13;
       low researcher salaries, unfavorable working conditions, and dissatisfaction&#13;
       with the current career path/incentive structure (ATA Annual Report&#13;
       2013/14). Also, since the EAIRâ&#128;&#153;s restructuring process undertaken by the&#13;
       government in 2008, a number of long-serving researchers have continued to&#13;
       leave EAIR in pursuit of better remuneration and working conditions. During&#13;
       2008-2012, 195 researchers, including 38 PhD researchers left the EIAR.&#13;
       Though efforts to improve researchersâ&#128;&#153; salary package have been initiated,&#13;
       whether this actions will be sufficient to halt the high rate of staff attrition&#13;
       remains uncertain (ASTI 2014).&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Coordination among research institutions. Research and extension&#13;
       activities are carried out by different organizations without much&#13;
       coordination (International Food Policy Research Institute 2010). At least 55&#13;
       research centers conduct agricultural research in Ethiopia. While EIAR is&#13;
       responsible for the overall coordination, the linkages among research&#13;
       institutions are insufficient. In fact, the low quality of researchers and high&#13;
       staff turnover often makes it difficult for the EIARâ&#128;&#153;s coordination mechanism&#13;
       to work properly.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Facility of the research institutions. Despite the development of the&#13;
       agricultural research system, studies have shown that all the research centers&#13;
       are not well equipped or laboratory facilities are not updated. (Dept.&#13;
       Agriculture, ESTC, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
4. National Quality Infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
113. A well-functioning National Quality Infrastructure (NQI) supports the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s transformation to an industrial led economy. NQI services support the&#13;
acquisition, handling and use of, maintenance, and disposal of scientific equipment at&#13;
various facilities, including academic and research institutions, where a number of&#13;

                                                                                                63&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
laboratories exist. Access to a good NQI is imperative to assure that Ethiopian firms&#13;
are able to enter and be competitive in international markets by assuring that the&#13;
quality of their services and products are aligned with required standards in the&#13;
international markets.&#13;
&#13;
114. Recognizing the importance of NQI, significant reforms have been&#13;
initiated to modernize Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s existing NQI institutional framework and&#13;
technical regulations. One of the key reforms undertaken was the MoSTâ&#128;&#153;s initiative&#13;
in February 2011 that restructured the former Quality and Standards Authority of&#13;
Ethiopia into four separate institutions which are responsible for the fields of&#13;
metrology, standards, accreditation, and conformity assessment. These are: National&#13;
Metrology Institute of Ethiopia (NMIE); Ethiopian Standards Agency (ESA); Ethiopian&#13;
National Accreditation Office (ENAO); and Ethiopian Conformity Assessment&#13;
Enterprise (ECAE).&#13;
&#13;
115. The reforms contributed to establishing a foundation of NQI institutions&#13;
for improved NQI services and international recognition. The reform brought a&#13;
clear division of responsibilities among NQI institutions, allowing them to handle&#13;
each task efficiently and further meet the pre-conditions for international&#13;
recognition. Major responsibility of each NQI institution and their achievements&#13;
through the reform are provided in Table A3.2 in annex.64.&#13;
&#13;
Importance of International Recognition&#13;
&#13;
116. Continuous efforts to create internationally recognized NQI institutions&#13;
are critical to introduce innovation that supports the integration of Ethiopian&#13;
firms into global markets and update the quality of research facilities at&#13;
academic institutions. Ethiopian exports are dominated by semi- or un-processed&#13;
and undifferentiated agricultural products65. Internationally recognized NQI&#13;
institutions can support the Ethiopian firms to improve their competitiveness in&#13;
international markets with higher value-added products by ensuring that their&#13;
products meet the required quality and standards in international markets. They can&#13;
also support the academic institutionsâ&#128;&#153; adoption of innovation by updating the&#13;
standards of their facilities, resulting in better research to support the development&#13;
of businesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
64   The reform was implemented through the GIZ programs, which have completed in September 2015&#13;

     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
117. Active engagement in regional metrology organizations and proper&#13;
operation of the established laboratories will be required to obtain&#13;
international recognition for NMIE. NMIE has the primary responsibility of&#13;
ensuring that any measurements made in Ethiopia can be traced to the international&#13;
system of units by using international standards. While calibration services provided&#13;
by NMIE are not yet internationally recognized, Ethiopia has been an active member&#13;
of the continent-wide Intra-Africa Metrology System (AFRIMETS)66. The proactive&#13;
engagement with the regional metrology organization is very important for&#13;
international recognition, as NMIEâ&#128;&#153;s calibration and measurement capabilities needs&#13;
to be recognized through key comparisons and peer evaluations from the AFRIMETS.&#13;
Currently, NMIE holds metrology laboratories, which have been accredited by&#13;
German accreditation organizations in March 2014, in the following six fields: mass;&#13;
temperature; pressure; volume; electricity; and weight. In order to apply for the&#13;
international recognition, NMIEâ&#128;&#153;s continued engagement with AFRIMETS and service&#13;
provision through its laboratories is critical.&#13;
&#13;
118. Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s active membership of international organizations is&#13;
important for standards. While there is no formal international recognition system&#13;
in standards, becoming members of international organizations is a key element to&#13;
adopting international standards. ESA has become a member of the International&#13;
Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Codex Alimentarius Commission67. It has&#13;
been a member of the African Regional Organization for Standardization since its&#13;
beginning, and also has close relations with the International Electro-technical&#13;
Commission (IEC)68. Maintaining the active engagements with these international&#13;
organizations are crucial for ESA to deliver required services on standardization and&#13;
technical regulation for its customers.&#13;
&#13;
119. Gaining international recognition for ENAO is a positive development.&#13;
ENAO has already applied for a full membership of the International Laboratory&#13;
Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and has received its peer evaluation. Availability of&#13;
competent accreditation services to local laboratories and certification/inspection&#13;
bodies will reduce the requirement for re-testing, re-inspecting, and re-certification&#13;
of Ethiopian products in importing countries. Since its establishment, ENAO sets its&#13;
target to obtain full membership of ILAC and to be a signatory to the Mutual&#13;
Recognition Agreement managed by ILAC and the International Accreditation Forum,&#13;
&#13;
66 Ethiopia hosted the AFRIMETSâ&#128;&#153;s 8th general assembly from July 16-20, 2014&#13;

     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
which grant international recognition to ENAO. This can be achieved when ENAO&#13;
receives and passes the peer evaluation by an international team at ILAC. As of date,&#13;
ENAO is waiting for the feedback and result from the peer review.&#13;
&#13;
120. Recognition of international level of conformity assessment services is&#13;
provided by accreditation. ECAE is responsible for inspection, laboratory testing&#13;
and certification services. The facilities of ECAE are currently accredited by ENAO.&#13;
The international recognition of ENAO will also provide ECAE with access to&#13;
international recognition as a competent institution in international markets.&#13;
&#13;
Common Challenges to be addressed&#13;
&#13;
121. To ensure sustainable service, the contributions of the state budget and&#13;
financing from NQI services and projects need to be defined. In the case of the&#13;
metrology services, the development of the national measurement standards is&#13;
usually considered as a public good, and the metrology institutions in almost all&#13;
countries are maintained significantly through the state budget. As accreditation is a&#13;
fee-based service, an accreditation body can in theory become self-sufficient. While&#13;
ENAO has committed to accredit 60 conformity assessment bodies seeking&#13;
accreditation, it has been shown empirically that 200 to 250 accredited organizations&#13;
are required to be self-sufficient69. Until ENAO becomes internationally recognized&#13;
and develops a market, financial support from the state will be required. In most&#13;
countries, the national standardization activities are not financially sustainable and&#13;
require additional sources of revenue. The government mostly leaves conformity&#13;
assessment to the private sector in developed countries, while the state still plays a&#13;
major role in developing countries. It is ideal for the government to facilitate the&#13;
development of conformity assessment provider from the private sector as well,&#13;
while maintaining its services until the market for conformity assessment services&#13;
grows.&#13;
&#13;
122. To ensure the provision of qualified services, development of strategies&#13;
to further strengthen the NQI institutions is critical. While the implemented&#13;
reforms to date were articulated in the NQI strategy for 2009-2015, the development&#13;
of another mid- and long-term strategy and time bound action plan is critical to&#13;
further strengthen the NQI institutions. It is also important that the new strategy will&#13;
be consistent with the vision and goals envisioned in the GTP and relevant sector&#13;
strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
69   Kellermann and Keller (2014)&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            66&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
123. To increase client satisfaction, the development of demand-driven NQI&#13;
institutions is important. NQI institutions need to ensure that firms and academic&#13;
and research institutions that receive NQI services are able to market their products&#13;
and services successfully. However, weak participation from these key stakeholders&#13;
in the governance of NQI institutions often hinders the development of demand-&#13;
driven NQI services. For example, each NQI institution has set up a council for its&#13;
fiduciary and strategic responsibilities. Common practice in developing countries is&#13;
to fill these with representatives from the public sector, while the private sector&#13;
remains underrepresented. In the case of ESA, the Ethiopian National Standardization&#13;
Council has one member representing the private sector out of the total of 12&#13;
members. It is important to have greater private sector representation such that&#13;
client demand feeds into the decision making process as well as the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of the NQI services provided.&#13;
&#13;
5. Government Initiatives to support the development of innovative&#13;
   enterprises&#13;
&#13;
124. Several programs to improve the access to finance for entrepreneurs&#13;
have been initiated by the government. While access to finance is one of the&#13;
pressing issues for the private sector to be innovative, it has been critical for the&#13;
government to provide direct and indirect support to the private sector. The most&#13;
successful of these interventions are those that have injected much-needed liquidity&#13;
into the financial sector, and have targeted the right segment of the client. However,&#13;
considering the major limitations of the financial sector in Ethiopia in lending to small&#13;
and young entrepreneurs, there remains much need for targeted support to improve&#13;
access to finance for innovative firms. The existing programs serve only a fraction of&#13;
the enormous demand from innovative enterprises for access to financial services.&#13;
Some of the major existing programs are summarized in the Table A3.2 (annex).&#13;
&#13;
125. The World Bank Info Devâ&#128;&#153;s initiative- Ethiopia Climate Innovation Center&#13;
(ECIC), supported through a multi donor trust fund provides entrepreneurial&#13;
support to early stage, growth oriented SMEs participating in the clean tech&#13;
sector. The ECIC targets early stages of innovation as well as more advanced growth-&#13;
oriented entrepreneurs reach their objectives. The types of support provided by the&#13;
ECIC includes: i) access to finance, by providing grants up to US$50,000 as well as&#13;
investment facilitation for more advanced firms; ii) business advisory support&#13;
through mentorship, seminars, and trainings; iii) marketing support, by providing&#13;
market studies and case reports relevant to the clean tech sector; iv) networking&#13;

agriculture; bio-fuels and bio-mass; transportation technologies; hydropower;&#13;
energy efficiency; waste management; and other clean-tech or clean-tech support&#13;
businesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Role of the government to support Innovation in Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
126. The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s strong initiative to foster the innovation eco-system&#13;
in Ethiopia is crucial, but it requires a lot of coordination among stakeholders.&#13;
Promoting innovation for the Ethiopian economy, including the BoP requires more&#13;
resources and redistribution of resources to policy implementation and relevant&#13;
action plans articulated in the STI policy. Also, policies for innovation cannot be&#13;
considered in isolation. They must take into account the entire innovation ecosystem,&#13;
market failure affecting the development of inclusive innovations, and the roles&#13;
played by different agents in the generation, transfer, and dissemination of&#13;
innovations for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s development71.&#13;
&#13;
127. The role of the government should be focused on the creation of a&#13;
functioning innovation infrastructure. The major role should be to facilitate,&#13;
support, incentivize and leverage the strengths of all stakeholders in order to create&#13;
sustainable inclusive solutions with significant outreach at maximum efficiency with&#13;
the least possible burden on the public resources. Contributions from the private&#13;
sector, the research and academic community, NGOs, and global partnerships â&#128;&#147; as&#13;
well as the BoP itself are essential to an effective innovation ecosystem.&#13;

CHAPTER 4: Recommendation and Policy Options for&#13;
Promoting Innovation in Ethiopia&#13;
This study has analyzed the extent of innovative activity that formal firms in Ethiopia&#13;
are undertaking and has reviewed the existing innovation ecosystem. The analyses&#13;
reviewed the ongoing initiatives to promote innovation in firms as well as those targeted&#13;
to the Base of the Pyramid. This chapter informs policymakers on how the environment&#13;
can be made more conducive for firms to undertake more innovative activities to&#13;
increase productivity as well as to provide innovative solutions to help alleviate poverty&#13;
and facilitate more equitable growth in the economy.&#13;
&#13;
128. The Government plays an essential role in ensuring entrepreneurs,&#13;
financial institutions, academia and industry create wealth for the society&#13;
through innovation. By providing a conducive regulatory and policy environment,&#13;
promoting greater competition through openness to trade and FDI and promoting an&#13;
education system that is responsive to industry needs, the government plays a central&#13;
role in promoting innovation. The State will play a particularly important role in&#13;
increasing innovation for the BoP before the private sector is able to build a profitable&#13;
and scalable business solution. Hence, the successful implementation of the STI policy&#13;
would be one of the most critical factors to ensure that innovative activity is&#13;
undertaken in the economy and there are returns to firms on these innovation&#13;
investments in terms of increased firm level productivity.&#13;
&#13;
1. Implementation of the Science, Technology and Innovation Policy&#13;
&#13;
129. The implementation of the STI policy for Ethiopia is crucial to facilitate&#13;
linkages between different actors and institutions involved in the innovation&#13;
ecosystem. Recognizing the important role and the urgent need for innovation to&#13;
increase the countryâ&#128;&#153;s sustainable development, Ethiopia adopted a new STI policy in&#13;
February 201272. As described in Chapter 3, there are various actors and institutions&#13;
relevant to the policy areas envisioned in the STI policy for Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
130. Strong political leadership is critical to facilitate the effective&#13;
communication and collaboration among key stakeholders, given the complex&#13;
organizational arrangements involved in the implementation of the STI policy&#13;
(See Figure 4.1). While the current implementation arrangement is in line with&#13;
international practice, key lessons learned from European countries emphasize the&#13;
&#13;
72The Ethiopian Science and Technology Agency, which is the current Ministry of Science and Technology,&#13;

&#13;
importance of inter-ministries and inter-agency bodies creating a coordinated and&#13;
coherent implementation of STI-policies. These lessons include: (i) involvement of&#13;
the right people with the needed qualifications (experienced, and both&#13;
knowledgeable on content and process) at implementing/coordinating body; (ii)&#13;
fairly broad mandates for the implementing/coordinating body to enhance&#13;
coordination between the various actors involved; and (iii) early identification of&#13;
cross departmental themes in order to keep the interdepartmental agenda fulfilled .&#13;

&#13;
131. Based on the key lessons from the European countries and the&#13;
importance of the implementation of an effective STI policy, there are a few&#13;
recommended policy actions that GoE could undertake.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   The development of STI policy implementation strategy. While the policy&#13;
        identifies basic objectives and strategies, it is important for all the&#13;
        stakeholders to understand a clear path to promote innovation in Ethiopia,&#13;
        including the BoP. The development of the implementation strategy for the STI&#13;
        policy will also support the identification of the priority sectors and cross-&#13;
        cutting areas, such as agriculture and health for this initiative.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Good Coordination mechanism. Given that the STI policy covers a wide range&#13;
        of topics which involve a number of organizations/institutions, a clear&#13;
        communication strategy among these stakeholders needs to be developed.&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            70&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Monitoring &amp; Evaluation mechanism implemented. To monitor the&#13;
       progress of STI policy (and implementation strategy), the Key Performance&#13;
       Indicators need to be developed and disclosed to the public, together with&#13;
       their progress. This could potentially be done through the website of MOST&#13;
       and can help sensitize the public to developments in the area and initiate&#13;
       feedback and discussion from the public including the private sector to help&#13;
       inform future policy making.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Feedback Mechanism from the Private Sector. Given the crucial role that STI&#13;
       Policy plays in the move towards an export led industrial growth&#13;
       transformation, the implementation of the policy needs to have clear&#13;
       ownership from the private sector. Ensuring representation from the private&#13;
       sector in stakeholder consultation and working groups would be pivotal to this&#13;
       exercise.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Robust National Quality Infrastructure. The STI Institutional and policy&#13;
       framework needs to support the development of the NQI which is crucial for&#13;
       the countryâ&#128;&#153;s transformation to an industrial led economy.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Framework for Inclusive Innovation Policy. The STI Policy has been framed&#13;
       under the vision of â&#128;&#156;alleviating poverty and joining the mid-level income&#13;
       earning countriesâ&#128;&#157;. Herein lies the clear role for Government to spearhead a&#13;
       strategy to develop an adequate policy framework for inclusive innovation.&#13;
&#13;
2. Promoting Greater Firm Level Innovation&#13;
&#13;
132. Analyses shows that firms in Ethiopia undertake lower levels of&#13;
innovative activities than those in comparator countries. The analysis conducted&#13;
in Chapter 2 shows limited access to credit poses a significant barrier to product&#13;
innovation in Ethiopia. Firms that are credit constrained are about 14 percentage&#13;
points less likely to undertake product innovation than are non-credit constrained&#13;
ones, everything else remaining equal. The analyses also shows that providing&#13;
training to employees and allowing employeesâ&#128;&#153; time to experiment are both factors&#13;
that positively correlate with the probability to engage in product innovation. These&#13;
findings corroborate the importance of human capital for innovation.&#13;
&#13;
133. Innovation also has a correlation to firm performance in Ethiopia.&#13;
Analyses conducted shows that firms that have introduced product or process&#13;
innovations in Ethiopia show higher sales growth than those that have not. Similarly,&#13;
process innovation and spending on R&amp;D appear to be triggers for employment&#13;
&amp;#12;     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                                71&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
creation in Ethiopia, and finally, the analysis shows that process innovation and&#13;
spending on R&amp;D enhance labor productivity. The government thus has a role to play&#13;
in alleviating some of the market failures that exist to ensure that there is adequate&#13;
skills and training and there is an incentive for firms to undertake innovative&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
134. In particular, a wide range of funding options can be used to stimulate&#13;
the supply of the innovation. Government funding for skills development for firms,&#13;
early stage technology, and pre-commercialization technology is a vital element of&#13;
many innovation systems, including direct funding of public labs and universities;&#13;
grants, matching grants, and indirect R&amp;D tax subsidies (which allow firms to choose&#13;
the most profitable research opportunities, switching some marginal projects from&#13;
being unprofitable to profitable)73.&#13;
&#13;
Facilitating Early Stage Financing and Capacity Building&#13;
&#13;
135. The distinct credit constraints for young and small firms in Ethiopia is a&#13;
clear impediment to innovation. Impediments to accessing finance for small and&#13;
young firms stem from the demand side of financial markets. Like in other developing&#13;
economies, credit in Ethiopia is more readily available to businesses that have fixed&#13;
assets such as land or buildings to be used as collateral than to those having movable&#13;
assets, as banks strongly prefer property to secure a loan. The average value of&#13;
collateral needed for loans in Ethiopia (234 percent of the loan amount) is also very&#13;
high compared to other regions of the world as well as to other developed economies&#13;
in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
136. Through the Ethiopia Climate Innovation Center (ECIC) the government&#13;
provides support to early stage financing in green sectors. The ECICs target early&#13;
stages of innovation, they also support more advanced growth-oriented&#13;
entrepreneurs reach their objectives. The types of support provided by the ECIC&#13;
includes: i) access to finance, by providing grants up to US$50,000; ii) mentoring&#13;
through seminars and trainings; iii) marketing support, by providing market studies&#13;
and case reports; iv) networking among entrepreneurs by creating regional hubs&#13;
within Ethiopia74; and v) policy support which provides advice on policy framework&#13;
of climate change to stakeholders. An increase in the support in other areas of the&#13;
economy towards early stage innovation financing would be beneficial to&#13;
entrepreneurs who are unable to find sources of financing through commercial banks.&#13;

     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Facilitating Learning from Exporting and Fostering Backward Links&#13;
through Foreign Direct Investment Growth&#13;
&#13;
137. Openness to trade is an important source of knowledge transfer and an&#13;
important motivation for firms to undertake innovative activities that increase&#13;
market share, productivity, and growth. Referred to as â&#128;&#156;learning from exporting,â&#128;&#157;&#13;
exporting firms are often under pressure to meet quality standards, including safety&#13;
and environmental regulations, established by their customers or the regulatory&#13;
authorities of destination countries. Such pressures can either strengthen incentives&#13;
for exporting firms to upgrade their technology or hinder other firms that lack the&#13;
requisites for exporting to more sophisticated markets.&#13;
&#13;
138. There are a few initiatives that have been introduced in Ethiopia to&#13;
address this market failure. These include the Ethiopian Competitiveness Facility&#13;
(ECF) which is a matching grants program initiated under the World Bank funded&#13;
Private Sector Capacity Building project and now further supported under the DFID&#13;
funded Private Enterprise Program Ethiopia (PEPE), managed by Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s MoI. The&#13;
ECF is designed to improve the competitiveness of the Ethiopian private sector, in&#13;
particular those focused towards the export market. The facility provides matching&#13;
grants up to US$200,000 to qualifying enterprises and funds are channeled through&#13;
four windows that include the export development window; the institutional&#13;
development window, chamber of commerce and sectoral association window and&#13;
domestic firms that are currently not exporting. Exporters were able to access&#13;
business development services and training to increase their firm level productivity&#13;
and decrease costs by using better production methods. The relative success of the&#13;
export window under the ECF led to the introduction of a new window under the&#13;
PEPE for the domestic firms that are not exporters which is a positive development&#13;
as many SMEs would benefit from the access to these business development service&#13;
and training opportunities that can be funded through the ECF. Firms benefit from&#13;
not having to bear the entire cost of the investment, and since they match the portion&#13;
paid for by the government, the program attracts genuinely committed firms.&#13;
&#13;
139. There is a need to promote linkages with and spillovers from foreign&#13;
investments with domestic firms. The GTP for Ethiopia seeks to transform the&#13;
economy towards an industrialized economy and to increase per capita income of its&#13;
citizens by 2025. To this effect, the Government has adopted policy focused on the&#13;
development of the manufacturing sector through the use of industrial parks to&#13;
attract FDI and to support SMEs75. It would be beneficial for the investment agency to&#13;

work actively with the investor community and seek out input providers and support&#13;
services they require that could be provided by domestic SMEs. The Government thus&#13;
acts as a facilitator and gathering information on possible opportunities for links,76&#13;
assisting in identifying partners (and arrangements) by matching suppliersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
capabilities and buyersâ&#128;&#153; needs (legal assistance, fairs, missions, conferences and&#13;
exhibitions, and so forth), and providing economic incentives to multinationals to&#13;
promote training and technology transfer from buyer firms to local supplier firms and&#13;
for SMEs to invest in training and capacity building. The Global Supplier Program was&#13;
an initiative that was successful in developing SME capabilities in the Malaysian&#13;
electronics industry and integrating them into the global value chain (see Box 4.1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Box 4.1: Malaysia: Skills Development for SMEs through matching grants&#13;
      The Global Supplier Program (GSP) funds training and skill development for SMEs in&#13;
      order to make them more innovative firms and to allow them to participate in global&#13;
      supply chains. Originally created in 2000 as an initiative by the regional Penang Skills&#13;
      Development Center, the GSP was quickly expanded at the country-level. Under the&#13;
      GSP, grant which covers up to 80 percent of training cost at a variety of regional centers&#13;
      and institutes are provided by government to SMEs. The key element of the GSP in&#13;
      terms of linkage creation is that Multinational Corporations (MNCs) representatives&#13;
      design the content of the training programs and participants are selected based on MNC&#13;
      criteria. Also, the selected SMEs are requested to co-finance at least 20 percent of the&#13;
      training cost; thus, acquiring the practical skills through the training is considered as a&#13;
      critical financial investment for the companies.&#13;
      Within its first year, the GSP had trained 813 employees from 225 SMEs, with the&#13;
      involvement of 23 MNCs or large domestic companies. Intel, for instance, has made&#13;
      significant use of the PSDC and the GSP.&#13;

3. Upgrading the National Quality Infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
140. The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s continued support to develop NQI is crucial for the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s transformation to an export led economy. Access to a good NQI is&#13;
imperative to assure that Ethiopian firms are able to enter and be competitive in&#13;
international markets by assuring that the quality of their services and products are&#13;
aligned with required standards in the international markets. To support innovation&#13;
in the firm level, in particular for exports, NQI services should be developed by&#13;
incorporating demand from the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
141. There is a need to develop a long term implementation strategy for the&#13;
NQI policy framework in Ethiopia. While the NQI institutions have developed their&#13;
strategies, in particular the steps required to obtain international recognition, it is&#13;
important to develop a long term strategy which includes the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
commitment of budget allocation, as all NQI institutions require long term financial&#13;
support from the government. This will ensure that all these institutions can make&#13;
medium to long term action plans to implement their strategies.&#13;
&#13;
142. There is a need to develop career paths and incentive structures for&#13;
skilled staff in NQI institutions. The delivery of NQI service relies heavily on trained&#13;
and skilled staff. While international donor agencies spend large amount of time for&#13;
training of staff, continued support to develop the necessary skills at each staff level&#13;
is required for NQI institutions. Moreover, these skilled people often leave NQI&#13;
institutions, because their salary and benefits sometimes do not meet their&#13;
expectations. The development of the new career path, including provision of various&#13;
training programs, and incentive structures for skilled staff will have a positive&#13;
impact on the stable operation of NQI institutions.&#13;
&#13;
143. To increase client satisfaction, the development of demand-driven NQI&#13;
institutions is important. NQI institutions need to ensure that firms and academic&#13;
and research institutions that receive NQI services are able to market their products&#13;
and services successfully. However, weak participation from these key stakeholders&#13;
in the governance of NQI institutions often hinders the development of demand-&#13;
driven NQI services. For example, each NQI institution has set up a council for its&#13;
&amp;#12;     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                                75&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
fiduciary and strategic responsibilities. It is important to get representatives from key&#13;
stakeholders, including prominent industry, and academic and research institutions,&#13;
to serve on these councils. This would ensure that NQI institutions obtain direct&#13;
feedback from stakeholders, and additionally that these stakeholders act as&#13;
marketing agents in their fields. The development of a robust monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system is also critical to regularly review the effectiveness of the council&#13;
and operation of these NQI institutions.&#13;
&#13;
4. Promoting Effective Industry- Research Linkages&#13;
&#13;
144. Government can also provide its support to strengthen university-&#13;
industry linkages in order to promote innovation. There is a need to strengthen&#13;
the effective linkages between academic institutions and industry, which contribute&#13;
to increased industrial productivity in Ethiopia. A critical misalignment exists&#13;
between the research outputs from academic institutions and the technology needs&#13;
of industry. Furthermore, the type of curricula and skills endowments of the&#13;
graduates of universities do not match the immediate skill needs of industry77.&#13;
&#13;
145. Measures to increase incentives for greater academia-industry&#13;
collaboration need to be introduced. Industry-research linkages can vary ranging&#13;
from joint research and consultancy services, to creating opportunities for student&#13;
internships, staff exchanges, and curriculum development for students. To promote&#13;
collaboration and partnership between university and industry including foreign&#13;
direct investors, government programs; such as mini-grants and matching grants, to&#13;
increase the incentives for the cooperation is required (see Box 4.2). In addition, there&#13;
is a need to better utilize the technology transfer system that has been initiated in the&#13;
IoTs. The successful operation of technology transfer system is a big task, but it is also&#13;
a good opportunity to improve the income situation of staff by generating new&#13;
projects and even jobs (see Box 4.3). Measures to include â&#128;&#156;on the job trainingâ&#128;&#157; that&#13;
contribute towards the credit for a student could provide incentives for students to&#13;
take these internships seriously as a source of learning and for firms to benefit from&#13;
new ideas and research to help solve real issues that it may face. Creating incentives&#13;
for researchers to collaborate with industry with this experience counting towards a&#13;
tenure track could ensure that researchers would be motivated to work with&#13;
industry. Finally, academic institutions should tap into the vast Ethiopian diaspora to&#13;
leverage on the global expertise and knowledge that they have by offering them&#13;
attractive short term assignments to work in the universities.&#13;
&#13;

  Working paper prepared by Open African Innovation Research &amp; Training in 2012. Also, situation analysis of&#13;

 Box 4.3: Technology Transfer Office: Case of University of Antioquia (Colombia)&#13;
 The University of Antioquia (UA) is a public university located in Medellin, Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
 second largest city. Founded in 1803, it is Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s oldest public university with 12&#13;
 regional campuses. The UA is also recognized as Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s highest percentage of&#13;
 excellence research group according to the National Board of Science and Technology.&#13;
 In 2000, UA recognized the importance of creating the linkage between the University,&#13;
 Industry and Government in the region in order to identify and develop business&#13;
 partnerships. By April of 2002, UA established â&#128;&#156;Technological Management Programâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
 with the responsibility of developing guidelines and managing policies on R&amp;D&#13;
 activities with private partners. This led to an increase in the share of research projects&#13;
 being financed by outside sponsors to 60 percent in 2004 from a mere 10 percent in&#13;
 1994.&#13;
 This positive shift was achieved through the establishment of the University and&#13;
 Industry Committee on Research and Technology, which is comprised of University&#13;
 board members and successful private businesses in the region. The committee is&#13;
 divided by sector and is led by a CEO of a successful private company. The committee&#13;
 meets the first Friday of every month at UAâ&#128;&#153;s R&amp;D Headquarters by representing&#13;
 strategically chosen sectors in the region, including food, car manufacturer, energy,&#13;
 textiles, chemistry, health, wood, and agricultural. The topics discussed at the&#13;
 committee include: i) identification of R&amp;D needs of the private sector; ii) interaction&#13;
 between university and industrial research groups; and iii) promotion of a risk capital&#13;
 fund for R&amp;D projects and new enterprises.&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            77&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  A key result from this active collaboration with the private sector included the&#13;
  Development of a low-cost and effective car paint: While a Colombian enterprise that&#13;
  assembles imported RENAULT requested to develop a six-year anticorrosive paint for&#13;
  the car manufacturing, a UA professor and the mechanical engineers came up with the&#13;
  new design of Surface Treatment Tunnel by which the outer casing of the car is&#13;
  submerged in a tunnel where anticorrosive paint is spread over every part of the car&#13;
  structure. This new Colombian engineering design was approved by RENAULT and the&#13;
  cost for development was half of what it would have cost them to use the available&#13;
  foreign technology. Through this development, UA received approximately $200,000&#13;
  USD for technology invention and around 13 local small companies benefited with this&#13;
  technology.&#13;

&#13;
While the development of innovation in agriculture sector has been prioritized, the&#13;
emphasis on the effective coordination among the relevant stakeholders and&#13;
improvement of the quality of the staff and research needs to be stressed.&#13;
&#13;
146. The development of the national implementation strategy for newly&#13;
established Ethiopian Agricultural Research Council (EARC) is crucial.&#13;
According to the ATA annual report, the establishment of EARC was approved by the&#13;
government. The EARC will coordinate and oversee the integration of various&#13;
research efforts made by the different research institutions. To support the existing&#13;
coordination issues, the development of the detailed strategy to address the existing&#13;
issues and strengthen the national agricultural research system is critical. In&#13;
particular, the national strategy should identify activities which have quick impacts&#13;
on increasing productivity, activities which would address medium term (upgrade of&#13;
value chain), and long term objectives to support agricultural sector development in&#13;
Ethiopia. Brazil was successfully able to develop an agricultural research institute&#13;
which served to create solutions that benefited the farmers and were thus readily&#13;
adopted (see Box 4.4).&#13;
&#13;
147. Coordination with National Science, Technology and Innovation Council.&#13;
There is a need to actively coordinate these initiatives with the National Science,&#13;
Technology and Innovation Council that plays an important role in promoting and&#13;
implementing the necessary support mechanisms to adopt innovative technologies.&#13;
&#13;
148. Development of career path and incentive structure for researchers.&#13;
Currently, MoA is working with Oxfam America and ATA to introduce attractive&#13;
career paths and incentive structures in line with international benchmarks. The&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
development of these new career paths and incentive structures will have a positive&#13;
impact in increasing the quality of agricultural research.&#13;

                                 Case of Embrapa&#13;
  One of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s initiatives to strengthen Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector and food&#13;
  security was the establishment of an effective and leading agricultural research&#13;
  organization, which is Embrapa (Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa AgropecuÃ¡ria).&#13;
  Embrapa has succeeded in adapting, creating, and transferring technologies to&#13;
  Brazilian farmers for the past 30 years, helping transform Brazil into one of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
  largest food exporters.&#13;
  Since its founding in 1973, Embrapa has created and transferred to Brazilian farmers&#13;
  more than 9,000 technologies and built an intellectual property portfolio of more than&#13;
  350 cultivars and about 200 international patents. It is currently considered as the&#13;
  worldâ&#128;&#153;s leading tropical research institute. Embrapa generated and transferred new&#13;
  technologies and techniques tailored to Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s climate and soil conditions. The use of&#13;
  these technologies by Brazilian farmers facilitated the expansion of Brazilian&#13;
  agriculture and increased exports at internationally competitive prices.&#13;
  The main success factor of the initiatives conducted by Embrapa is Embrapaâ&#128;&#153;s mission&#13;
  orientation, focusing from the outset on the improvement of agricultural productivity&#13;
  rather than the production of scientific work. Its mission driven culture has been&#13;
  supported by various elements, including: i) an open IPR policy and a network of offices&#13;
  spread throughout the country which help to facilitate the dissemination of Embrapaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
  discoveries; ii) adequate level of State funding to support its activities for more than&#13;
  two decades; and iii) its priority to invest in the human capital of researchers.&#13;
  As a result, researchers worked on finding solutions for the agricultural sector, and&#13;
  technology and innovations sourced through Embrapa were quickly adopted by&#13;
  farmers. By reacting to market signals and focusing on activities for which demand was&#13;
  increasing in international markets, Embrapa avoided being supply driven.&#13;

5. Providing an Incentive Framework to foster Inclusive Innovation&#13;
&#13;
149. The government will also play a particularly important role in increasing&#13;
innovation for the BoP by addressing their low demand due to limited access to&#13;
information. Inclusive innovation can boost the welfare of the BoP by providing&#13;
innovative products and finding innovative ways to address their needs (i.e., energy-&#13;
efficient cook stoves, water purifiers, or certain vaccines). However, several examples&#13;
show that low levels of education among the BoP population hinder opportunities to&#13;
&amp;#12;     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                                79&#13;
     in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
gain knowledge about potentially useful products and about how best to use them78.&#13;
Also, poor individualsâ&#128;&#153; investment decisions tend to be inefficient, thereby lowering&#13;
demand for innovative products.&#13;
&#13;
150. As is the case for Ethiopia as well, the strong community involvement is&#13;
critical. For this purpose, it is important to establish partnership with local NGO or&#13;
intermediaries which communicate with the targeted BoP population through&#13;
regular and well publicized visits about the benefits of adopting innovative products&#13;
as well as innovative service delivery. Using the existing community network and&#13;
their knowledge; such as door-to-door distribution and advertising strategies, has&#13;
been used as successful practices by businesses to reach to the BoP, and this approach&#13;
can be replicated for the government initiative. The examples are the followings79:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   VisionSpring, a social enterprise, is a network of women in India and El&#13;

       â&#128;¢   Hindustan Unilever (India) through the Shakty Initiative trains women to&#13;
           become micro-entrepreneurs by selling personal care products. Consumers&#13;
           benefit through better personal hygiene and prevention of illness, and the&#13;
           women improve their bargaining positions inside their households and their&#13;
           communities; and&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   The NGO Gyan Shala provides primary education in India at low cost by using&#13;
           standardized curricula and lesson plans to exploit economies of scale. The&#13;
           approach has also made it easier to monitor the quality of the education&#13;
           service provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
151. The government has a role to play in developing a market for inclusive&#13;
innovation technologies that bear a high upfront cost leading to a lack of&#13;
incentives for the private sector to produce. The case of AAKASH Tablet (see Box&#13;
4.5) indicates the market for inclusive innovations can be developed by the&#13;
government, wherein the Government of India used demand side policies such as&#13;
public procurement by creating a market for low cost tablets.&#13;

&#13;
    Box 4.5: AAKASH Tablet: Bringing Low-Cost Computers to Students in India&#13;
 The Aakash Tablet is a good example of how public procurement can help create a&#13;
 market for inclusive innovations and of the importance of setting clear procurement&#13;
 evaluation to avoid disruptions in the process.&#13;
 In 2010, the Indian government announced the development of the Aakash tablet to&#13;
 provide low-cost computers to the nationâ&#128;&#153;s growing college student population. It&#13;
 assigned the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Rajasthan the task of producing the&#13;
 first 100,000 tablets at the US$35 price point. IIT Rajasthan followed an open bid&#13;
 process and selected the lowest bidder (DataWind) among all bids deemed eligible. In&#13;
 mid-2011, DataWind sent three batches of tablets for testing, all of which did not meet&#13;
 the standard required by IIT Rajasthan. Despite these disagreements, the Indian&#13;
 government unveiled the manufactured tablet at the scheduled launch in October 2011.&#13;
 The government also announced that there would be two versions of the tablet: (i)&#13;
 Aakash computers, subsidized by the government and distributed to students at US$35;&#13;
 and (ii) the Ubi Slate 7, commercially available at US$60. Continued testing of the&#13;
 Aakash tablets by students highlighted the need for several improvements, such as&#13;
 longer battery life and a faster processor. In November 2011, the government and&#13;
 DataWind agreed that the remaining tablets of its 100,000 order would have such&#13;
 upgrades and IIT Rajasthan would send its specific testing criteria. However, the testing&#13;
 criteria included measures such as ability to withstand four inches of rain, which Data&#13;
 Wind contended was not included in the original specifications.&#13;
 While the effort was eventually successful, it was delayed a long time. Quad Electronics,&#13;
 Data Windâ&#128;&#153;s consortium partner, had never manufactured a tablet before and was&#13;
 producing fewer than 700 tablets a day. DataWind opened new manufacturing facilities&#13;
 in India to raise its productivity and eventually ended its agreement with Quad&#13;
 Electronics. Several financial and legal disputes also contributed to the delays. Quad&#13;
 Electronics and IIT Rajasthan claimed that DataWind owed them US$1.12 million and&#13;
 almost US$500 million, respectively. DataWind in turn claimed that the school owed it&#13;
 US$100,000 from a bid deposit. The Indian government maintained that production&#13;
 would continue and that Aakash 2 would be unveiled to the rest of the students in&#13;
 November 2012. The government and DataWind met that goal. The device was sold at&#13;
 US$21 for students of engineering colleges, with the government subsidizing the other&#13;
 half of the cost.&#13;
 The case of the Aakash tablet provided several lessons:&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Clear procurement evaluation criteria. First, clear procurement evaluation&#13;
      criteria are necessary. Because of the unclear criteria in the initial public&#13;
      procurement, expectations were not met. Furthermore, the government chose a&#13;
      company that had never produced a tablet before, making timely and cost-&#13;
      efficient production difficult.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Market Creation. Second, while procurement processes hampered the&#13;
      government from providing tablets to students at the price point it wanted, it did&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            81&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        succeed in creating a market. Because DataWind proved it could make a tablet&#13;
        for under US$60, more tablet makers entered the market at this price point.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Incorporating customer feedback. Third, the government listened carefully to&#13;
        the feedback from customers and endeavored to improve the design based on&#13;
        that feedback. Such public procurement of a consumer product, while it was&#13;
        delayed by several disputes, represents a first of its kind in India.&#13;

&#13;
152. The government can also provide its support to stimulate the adoption,&#13;
adaptation, and generation of innovative technologies by entrepreneurs, before&#13;
the private sector is able to build a profitable and scalable business solution. An&#13;
example where the government has played a pivotal role in fostering inclusive&#13;
innovation is India. A Public-private partnership model, the Inclusive Innovation&#13;
Fund (see Box 4.6) in India is built on the principle that innovative enterprises can&#13;
profitably, scalably, and competitively engage the BoP: and, in doing so, provide goods&#13;
and services that will transform their lives for the better. Ethiopia can leverage on&#13;
existing initiatives around the world by facilitating international linkages with firms&#13;
(through joint ventures) and industry-academia linkages in other countries to work&#13;
on providing solutions relevant for the BoP in Ethiopia. The large Ethiopian diaspora&#13;
provides a further opportunity to effectively leverage these linkages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         Box 4.6: India Inclusive Innovation Fund:&#13;
  India Inclusive Innovation Fund (IIIF) is one of the examples for the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
  financial intervention to address social issues by increasing access to finance for&#13;
  innovations aimed at tackling inclusive businesses.&#13;
  Despite having a large publicly funded science and technology infrastructure and an&#13;
  established higher education system, India has not fully exploited its innovation&#13;
  potential. While a number of initiatives to enhance the countryâ&#128;&#153;s innovation ecosystem&#13;
  have been implemented, one of the critical actions undertaken was to establish the&#13;
  National Innovation Council in 2010 as a high level coordination body to develop a&#13;
  national roadmap for innovation over the next decade and to manage various&#13;
  innovation-related activities.&#13;
  Inclusive growth has been one of the most important economic strategies of the Indian&#13;
  government, being incorporated into its national development strategy â&#128;&#147; both in 11th&#13;
  five year plan 2007-12 and the 12th five year plan, 2012-17. While majority of the labor&#13;
  force is in the informal sector, this sector lacks science, technology, and innovation&#13;
  support mechanism. In an effort to address more than half of India's population who&#13;
  are considered as the BoP, three years after announcing the setting up the IIIF, the&#13;
  National Innovation Council and the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            82&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  (MSME) officially announced the launch of the IIIF in January 2014 with the initial&#13;
  capital of Rs 500 crore. The IIIF would be eventually scaled up to ten (10) times of the&#13;
  fund size over the next two years by raising funds from external investors.&#13;
  The IIIFâ&#128;&#153;s principle concept is to combine innovation and the dynamism of business to&#13;
  solve the problems the BoP is facing in India. The IIIF focuses on creating a new class of&#13;
  capital which helps set up and scale entrepreneurial skills and innovation. The fund will&#13;
  invest in innovative ventures that are scalable and sustainable, but address social needs&#13;
  of the population in areas of agriculture, healthcare, education and skills development,&#13;
  energy, financial inclusion, water, sanitation employment generation, etc.&#13;
  While conventional commercially-focused companies do have access to finance to some&#13;
  extent, ventures and start-ups which focus on BoP business find it much harder to&#13;
  access finance, in particular risk funding, ranging from seed to early-stage ideas. The&#13;
  IIIF supports the entire ecosystem in this space, including incubators, angel groups, and&#13;
  also public research and development programs and laboratories to support the&#13;
  commercialization and deployment of socially relevant innovative technologies and&#13;
  solutions.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
153. At the same time, there are several elements that need to be considered&#13;
when it comes to government supported fund for inclusive innovation. Main&#13;
issues are: having an appropriate business model and exit strategy. There are&#13;
opportunities for for-profit driven inclusive innovation. However, relatively few&#13;
companies have so far managed to realize the potential of inclusive innovation for&#13;
business growth and development impact at larger scale. While high sensitivity to&#13;
price is the most obvious characteristic of the BoP, the appropriate economic model&#13;
with reasonable returns is critical for the sustainability and expansion of the business.&#13;
Moreover, without clear exist strategies, including valuation of the companies, and&#13;
regulatory framework on early stage financing, it would be difficult to justify the use&#13;
of the public fund in terms of accountability and transparency.&#13;
&#13;
154. As access to the BoP markets often involve higher costs due to the costs&#13;
imposed by intermediaries and other distortions, public intervention for the&#13;
inclusive innovation can be effective by supporting the establishment of the entire&#13;
ecosystem, including lack of information, access to local resources, distribution&#13;
channels, and supportive business regulations.&#13;
&#13;
6. Raising Awareness&#13;
&#13;
155. The government has a key role to play in raising awareness of the private&#13;
benefits of undertaking innovative activities. This chapter has elaborated on how&#13;
&amp;#12; Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation&#13;
                                                                                            83&#13;
 in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
government can facilitate innovative activity both to increase firm level productivity&#13;
and provide solutions aimed at addressing issues faced by the base of the pyramid.&#13;
Key barriers to inclusive innovation include consumer behavior, traditional business&#13;
models and information asymmetries that exist. The low rate of farmersâ&#128;&#153; adoption&#13;
rates of improved seeds is a case in point of risk aversion behavior that exists&#13;
preventing farmers from trying out something new. It is thus important for the state&#13;
to address this by increasing awareness and showcasing successful pilots to ensure&#13;
greater adoption of new technologies and processes. Finally, there is a role for&#13;
innovation to be encouraged amongst the young minds and for the school curricula&#13;
to encourage an innovation driven culture.&#13;
&#13;
156. The objective of all the policy instruments reviewed here is to create an&#13;
ecosystem that fosters greater levels of innovative activity promoting greater&#13;
productivity and increasing Ethiopian firm competitiveness and increasing the&#13;
supply of innovative ideas aimed at addressing the needs of the base of the pyramid&#13;
thus bridging growth and equity for the Ethiopian economy.&#13;

            Unlocking firm level productivity and
            promoting more inclusive growth : the role of innovation in Ethiopia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Rapid and consistent economic growth of
            Ethiopia over the past decade has contributed to reducing
            the number of people living in poverty. The Government of
            Ethiopia has created the growth and transformation plan
            (GTP), focusing on two overarching themes: fostering
            competitiveness and employment, and enhancing resilience and
            reducing vulnerabilities. This plan recognizes that for
            poverty reduction and economic growth to be sustainable, the
            Ethiopian economic structure will have to undergo a
            fundamental transformation. In accordance with a focus on
            poverty reduction and economic growth, the GTP has
            identified five main levers for change: public sector
            investment in infrastructure to lay the ground for private
            sector development, enhancement of policies and regulations
            to provide an environment conducive to competitiveness and
            productivity, expanding access to credit for small and
            medium size enterprises, provision of training and education
            to augment the supply of skilled labor, and improved access
            to land. Technological adoption and innovation will play a
            crucial role in delivering the goals laid out in the GTP.
            Participation in foreign markets also induces firms to
            become more innovative, a phenomenon known as learning
            through exporting, as observed among Ethiopian leather
            exporters. Another vital determinant of innovative activity
            is the accumulation of human capital and the skill level of
            the workforce. This study seeks: (i) to empirically analyze
            the extent of innovative activities that formal firms are
            undertaking in Ethiopia; (ii) to conduct a review of the
            existing innovation landscape; and (iii) to identify
            opportunities to foster innovations at the base of the
            pyramid (BoP) in Ethiopia. This study is structured as
            follows: chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two
            provides a detailed overview of the characteristics of
            growth and innovation, by providing key insights based on
            the enterprise survey analysis on the characteristics,
            motivations, operational and market environment and
            constraints of the innovators in Ethiopia. Chapter three
            assesses the innovation landscape in Ethiopia, by looking at
            the governmental and private agencies responsible to promote
            innovation, as well as active programs, and donor
            initiatives which may play a role in promoting firm level
            and pro-poor innovations. Chapter four provides policy
            recommendations to promote innovation in Ethiopia both at
            the firm level and in the form of pro-poor initiatives.
