            Global scaling up sanitation : utilizing
            community-based registers to monitor improved access to
            sanitation and hygiene in Tanzania
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In Tanzania, the Water and Sanitation
            Program (WSP) has been supporting the Government of Tanzania
            in 10 districts to increase access to improved sanitation.
            This initiative to improve rural sanitation at large scale
            combines Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), behavior
            change communication, and sanitation marketing approaches,
            and supports both local and national governments to develop
            capacity to create sustainable change. In recent years,
            there has been limited progress in establishing a
            standardized, systematic monitoring system to track
            sanitation and hygiene conditions in Tanzania. Manually
            generated reports are used to capture data on an ad hoc
            basis. Two challenges exist. First, even though it is
            commonly used in fieldwork, manual data collection is always
            subject to error. For example, a check is made in the wrong
            box or numbers are added inaccurately. A certain level of
            error is acceptable and is built into the interpretation of
            data, but it is important to establish the exact level of
            error in order to know how representative and accurate the
            information is. Second, without a standardized framework,
            comparing the data between districts or villages or
            capturing an accurate picture of the current situation is
            difficult. To increase standardization and accuracy of data
            collection, WSP is working with local governments and CLTS
            committees to implement community-based and managed
            registers. The registers are designed to monitor progress
            toward improved hygiene and sanitation at the household
            level. The registers have been introduced by local
            government at the sub-village level during CLTS triggering
            and are the primary tool that the sub-village CLTS committee
            uses to monitor progress.
