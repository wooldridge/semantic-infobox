HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Project Summarv&#13;
Borrower:          India, acting by its President&#13;
Implementing       Central Water Commission (CWC), Central Groundwater Board (CGWB),&#13;
Agencies:          Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS), and National Institute of&#13;
Hydrology (NIH) within the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR); India&#13;
Meteorological Department (IMD) within the Ministiy of Science and&#13;
Technology); and the Governments of Andra Praldesh (GOAP). Gujarat (GOG).&#13;
Kerala (GOK), Madhya Pradesh (GOMP), Maharashtra (GOM), Orissa (GOO),&#13;
and Tamil Nadu (GOTN) through their agencies responsible fro surface water&#13;
and groundwater hydrology.&#13;
Amount:            IDA Credit SDR 90.1 million (US$ 142.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:             Standard terms with a 35 years maturity&#13;
Re-lending Terms:   From the GOI to the states, as part of the central assistance to the State&#13;
development on terms and conditions as applicable at that time.&#13;
Project Description:  The Project would assist GOI and the seven participating states to develop&#13;
comprehensive, easily accessed and user friendly data bases covering all&#13;
aspects of the hydrological cycle, including suiface water and groundwater&#13;
in terms of quantity and quality and climatic measurements, particularly of&#13;
rainfall. The project supports the objectives of GOI's National Water Policy&#13;
and the Bank's strategy for India's water sector and policy regarding water&#13;
resources management. Special attention would be paid to standardization of&#13;
criteria, processes and procedures for measurement of hydrological&#13;
parameters and for storage and retrieval of information so that data series&#13;
would be compatible and the data bases would be interactive. The project&#13;
would be structured as a six-year operation and include support of:&#13;
upgrading and expanding the physical infrastructure for all aspects of the&#13;
collection, collation, processing and dissemination of hydrological and&#13;
hydrometeorological data; provision of equipment and materials;&#13;
institutional strengthening including technical assistance and training and;&#13;
new buildings and incremental operating and maintenance costs.&#13;
Benefits and Risks:  The project would generate substantial indirect benefits by assisting in the&#13;
development of more reliable and spatially intensive data on the quantity and&#13;
quality of water resources and making information available to legitimate&#13;
users from computerized data banks. The main project risks are generally&#13;
known fiom the work undertaken for project preparation and appraisal. The&#13;
project has been designed to address and minimize specific risks, as&#13;
described below. The institutional risks include the ability to achieve and&#13;
maintain organizational arrangements envisaged, adequate staffing and&#13;
operating budgetary resources. Actions proposed to address these risks&#13;
include: (i) the six-year project period; (ii) improved inter-agency&#13;
coordination; and (iii) provision of technical assistance, training and&#13;
institutional support. Technical risks are relatively small and relate mainly to&#13;
quality control issues. All proposed technologies have been tested and used&#13;
outside (and some inside) India and have proven effective. However, sorne&#13;
may be novel to some agencies involved and may proceed more slowly than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
anticipated. This risk is contained by flexible process approach with annual&#13;
reviews of work programs and by: (i) standardization of data collection,&#13;
validation and storage; (ii) special attention to quality control and monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of project impact: and (iii) ensuring that lessons learned and&#13;
experience gained are shared among hydrology data users and stakeholders.&#13;
The environmental risks associated with the project are minimal. The overall&#13;
environmental impact would be positive due to reliable data to improve all&#13;
aspects of water resource development and management.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
I. SECTOR AND PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.01   The development and efficient use of India's water resources for a wide range of purposes&#13;
is critical to the country's economic well-being and to the overall welfare of its people. Meeting the&#13;
food demands of the very large and growing population has required the development of&#13;
essentially all the available land that is suitable for agricultural production and the commitment of a&#13;
very large proportion of the available water resources to irrigation in order to increase cropping&#13;
intensities and crop yields on the land. Meanwhile, there are growing and competing demands for&#13;
water resource development to provide supplies for municipalities and urban populations, rural&#13;
communities, industry and power generation. It is also recognized that sufficient water of&#13;
appropriate quality must be left in-stream during the low flow season to sustain wildlife and meet&#13;
other environmental demands. And in some cases it is necessary to maintain river flows for&#13;
navigation. In contrast, there is need in many parts of India to develop flood control works to&#13;
protect populations and their property, which are increasingly forced to occupy flood-prone lands.&#13;
1.02  A reliable data base providing historical records for all aspects of the hydrological cycle is&#13;
essential for planning and management of water resources development. This is particularly&#13;
important when the development of this unitary resource approaches its limits in any basin area and&#13;
conflict and competition between users becomes a common occurrence. In this situation, a&#13;
scientifically designed data base, with appropriate coverage of all important aspects of hydrology in&#13;
space and time, is required for analyses of potentials for new water resources developments, for&#13;
long-term planning and real-time management of the resources, and for preservation of the&#13;
resources within the overall environment in both quantitative and qualitative terns.&#13;
1.03 The concerned agencies in the Government of India (GOI) and in the State Governments of&#13;
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala, Orissa and Tamil Nadu have&#13;
recognized the need: (a) to improve their hydrological data bases in terms of coverage and&#13;
accuracy; (b) to improve their capabilities for storage, retrieval and interpretation of data elements&#13;
through use of computers with appropriate peripherals and software; (c) to ensure rapid transfer of&#13;
data between concerned agencies by connecting computerized data bases through satellite and land&#13;
communication links; and (d) to enhance the publication and access of information to eligible users&#13;
in the public domain. The concerned agencies recognize that achievement of the above goals will&#13;
need improvement of institutional and staff capabilities at all levels through focused institutional&#13;
strengthening and a large-scale trainini g exercise, and will need some organizational changes in the&#13;
agencies. The proposed project is designed to assist in the achievement of the above objectives.&#13;
Background&#13;
1.04 The land surface of India, coveting about 3.3 M km2, may be subdivided into six major&#13;
physiographic regions. The Himalayan ranges occupy large areas of the extreme northwest and&#13;
northeast of the country. The great Indo-Gangetic plain encompasses an area of about 650,000&#13;
km2, which extends from the deserts of northern Rajasthan to the high rainfall area of West&#13;
Bengal. The central highlands lie between the Indo-Gangetic plain and the peninsular plateaus.&#13;
They include the divide between the northward-draininig tributaries of the Ganges river system and&#13;
the rivers which drain eastward to the Bay of Bengal or westward to the Arabian Sea. The plateaus&#13;
form the largest of the physiographic units. They are bounded on the west by the escarpments of&#13;
the Western Ghats which rise fi-om a narrow coastal plain. The Eastem Ghats mark the eastern&#13;
edge of the plateaus with escarpments which overlook an alternation of deltas and coastal plains.&#13;
The seven states which will participate in the project (para 1.03) form a contiguous block of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
country covering about 0.98 M km2 (about 30% of India's total area) which includes part of the&#13;
central highlands region, the whole of the peninsula plateaus, the whole of the Western Ghats and&#13;
the whole of the Eastern Ghats.&#13;
1.05  India has a diversity of tropical and subtropical climates ranging from oceanic along the&#13;
coasts to continental in most of the land mass. Rainfall conditions range from arid to humid. The&#13;
incidence of rainfall is controlled mainly by the occurrence of the monsoons. The southwest&#13;
monsoon reaches the whole of India during June to September. The northeast monsoon passes&#13;
over the southern end of the peninsula during October to December. Thus, the marked seasonality&#13;
of rainfall reflects the distribution and timing of the monsoons. The spatial variation in annual&#13;
rainfall amounts in India is extremely wide, ranging from less than 100 mm in parts of the&#13;
Rajasthan desert to more than 4,000 mm in parts of the Western Ghats and in the extreme northeast&#13;
of the country. A similar spatial variation in annual rainfall occurs within the area covered by the&#13;
eight states participating in the project.&#13;
Surface Water and Groundwater Resources&#13;
1.06 Water Availability. A 1988 publication by the Central Water Commission (CWC) estimates&#13;
that the average annual natural run-off available to India is about 1,880 billion cubic meters&#13;
(BCM). Of this total, about 600 BCM (32%) is generated in the Brahmaputra and Barak (Meghna)&#13;
basins and about 500 BCM (27%) in the Ganges basin, leaving only 780 BCM (41%) from the&#13;
remaining basins of India, which cover 56% of the country's land surface. The average annual&#13;
run-off from the basins which cover the seven states participating in the project (excluding the run-&#13;
off to the Ganges river from Madhya Pradesh) totals about 520 BCM or 28% of the run-off&#13;
available to India.&#13;
1.07  The amounts of unit area run-off from the various basins of India vary widely, reflecting&#13;
the spatial distribution of annual rainfall intensity. As examples, the unit area run-off from the&#13;
catchment areas totaling about 60,000 km2 covering the Saurashtra peninsula in Gujarat is about&#13;
35,000 m3/km2 (equivalent to a depth of 40 mm on the area), as compared to about 472,000&#13;
m3/km2 on the Mahanadi basin of 141,600 km2 (equivalent to a depth of 470 mm on the area).&#13;
The problems of the spatial diversity of surface water run-off in India are exacerbated by the&#13;
marked seasonality of run-off reflecting the incidence of the monsoons. Most of the rivers carry&#13;
about 80% of their annual flows during the months of June to September when the southwest&#13;
monsoon crosses the entire country. Generally, the rivers carry 90% of their annual flows during&#13;
the period June to November. Thus, there is a marked low flow season in December-May, and the&#13;
rivers draining the cenitr-al highland and plateau regions (which lack snow melt run-off) have&#13;
extremely low flows by the end of the dry season. The problem of the marked seasonality of&#13;
natural river flows is compounded by wide inter-annual variation of run-off from any basin&#13;
reflecting variation in annual rainifall amounts on the catchments. As an example, the 1948-79 data&#13;
series of annual run-off from the Narmada basin provides a mean annual value of 45 BCM, but the&#13;
extreme range in the series is 21-76 BCM -or 47% to 169% of the mean.&#13;
1 .08  The most recent estimate of the replenishable groundwater resources of India, excluding the&#13;
resources of the Brahmaputra and Barak basins. is about 450 BCM/yr. Of this total, about 207&#13;
BCM (45%) are estimated to occur in the seven states which will participate in the project. The&#13;
Indian practice is to allocate about 15% of the estimated resource to present and future community&#13;
water supplies and industrial uses and regard the balance as utilizable groundwater for irrigation.&#13;
However, this estimate is made without accounting for outflows from the groundwater systems to&#13;
the rivers and for groundwater consumed by natural wild vegetation. Most of these 'losses' are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
essentially uncontrollable. Moreover, groundwater outflows to the rivers are the source of&#13;
essentially all the natural dry season flows of the river systems of India which do not have a snow-&#13;
melt contribution.&#13;
1.09  It should be noted that the natural run-off estimates developed by CWC (para. 1.06) are&#13;
inclusive of the groundwater outflows to the surface water systems. However, as noted above&#13;
(para 1.08), the methodology used by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and the state&#13;
groundwater organizations (SGO) for evaluating groundwater resources does not specifically take&#13;
account of this contribution to surface water when calculating groundwater availability. Thus,&#13;
there is a definite problem that surface water and groundwater availability are not assessed&#13;
conjunctively, and this results in double accounting and over-estimation of the total water resource.&#13;
1.10  Constitutional and Legal Aspects of Water Resources. Under the Indian Constitution,&#13;
every State Government has power to legislate in respect of water, and can exercise this power for&#13;
the whole or any part of the state. The state's authority extends to all works for use and control of&#13;
water within its jurisdiction. Thus, water and its development is primarily a state subject.&#13;
1.11  The Union has power under the Constitution to legislate through Parliament for the&#13;
regulation and development of interstate rivers and river basins. Thus, the authority of the State&#13;
Government over water can be exercised within such limitation as may be imposed by law by&#13;
Parliament, but the Union cannot acquire the rights of user or of constructing water development&#13;
works within a state. Except with regard to a few specific projects (for example, the Damodar&#13;
Valley Development), Parliament has not considered it expedient to impose any general limitations&#13;
on the development of interstate rivers and their basins.&#13;
1. 12 Parliament gave authority to Central Government under the River Boards Act of 1956 to set&#13;
up a River Board for any interstate river, but the Boards are entirely advisory and cannot restrict or&#13;
control State Governments regarding water. The Constitution authorizes Parliament to provide for&#13;
the adjudication of any disputes between the riparian regarding use of water in an interstate river or&#13;
basin by law. Using this provision, Parliament passed the Interstate Water Disputes Act of 1956,&#13;
which sets out the conditions under which a water dispute can arise, and authorizes Central&#13;
Government to refer any water dispute, which cannot be settled by interstate agreement, to a legal&#13;
tribunal for adjudication. In this respect, any of the riparian states can also ask GOI to set up a&#13;
tribunal. The tribunal findings are regarded as final for the specified period of the award - typically&#13;
about 50 years.&#13;
1.13  Under the rights laid down by the Constitution, the power to legislate the control of&#13;
groundwater development rests with the State Governments. The degree to which the states have&#13;
exercised this power to date has been minimal.&#13;
1.14 Water Sharing Arrangements between Riparian. Essentially all the important river basins&#13;
of India cover two or more states, and the Indus and the Ganges have basin areas which extend&#13;
beyond the boundaries of the Union. The major river basins of the states which will participate in&#13;
the project are listed below together with the proportions of their basins occurring in the riparian&#13;
states; none of those rivers are international rivers.&#13;

1. 1 5 Within the project's participating states, parts of the surface water resources are shared&#13;
according to various agreements between the riparian or under tribunal awards. The Godavari&#13;
waters are shared by interstate agreement with a tribunal award permitting Andhra Pradesh to make&#13;
a water transfer from the Godavari to the Krishna. The waters of the Narmada and Krishna are&#13;
shared between the riparian according to tribunal awards (with an allocation to the non-riparian,&#13;
Rajasthan, from the Narmada). In the cases of the Subernarekha, Tapi and Mahi, parts of the&#13;
waters are shared under interstate agreements. Developments on the Mahanadi, Brahmani and&#13;
Baitarani have not as yet caused disputes or required interstate agreements. An interstate dispute&#13;
between Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala regarding the Cauvery waters remains unresolved&#13;
since the previous agreement terminated in 1974 (the dispute is now under adjudication by a&#13;
Tribunal). All the tribunal awards are time-bound and may be subject to reassessment at a&#13;
specified future date. A weakness of all the agreements is that they generally allocate proportions&#13;
from an estimated dependable yield without specifying the timing when withdrawals may occur.&#13;
None of the existing agreements make arrangements for sharing groundwater.&#13;
Hydrology in India&#13;
1. 16 General. Hydrology may be defined as the science that deals with the processes governing&#13;
the depletion and replenishment of the surface water and groundwater resources of the earth. In&#13;
this respect, it may be regarded as a branch of physical geography. Engineering hydrology&#13;
includes those segments of the very broad field of hydrology pertinent to the design and operation&#13;
of engineered projects for the control and use of water.&#13;
1. 17 Hydrometry is the technology of water measurement, covering all aspects of water&#13;
movement within the hydrological cycle. Thus, sound hydrometry is basic to the science of&#13;
hydrology in that it provides the data which are essential for all hydrologic computations and&#13;
quantifications. Essentially all the field work in hydrology is concerned with hydrometry. A&#13;
major objective of the project will be to improve the performances of the concerned Indian Federal&#13;
and State Government agencies in carrying out their hydrometric tasks in order to provide basic&#13;
data which are more reliable and have an appropriate spatial distribution. This will include water&#13;
clualitv monitoring for general and environmental purposes. The availability of such data will&#13;
enhance the accuracy of the hydrological analyses which provide the information on which all&#13;
water planning and management decisions should be made and all water project design and&#13;
operation concepts should be based.&#13;

resources has been led, since the 1 850s, by the need to create large public sector irrigation schemes&#13;
to secure and increase food production to support the growing population. Until around the end of&#13;
the 19th century, navigation--on rivers, irrigation canals and single purpose navigation canals--&#13;
was an important water resource use, but this declined rapidly in the early 20th century. Planning&#13;
and design of large river diversion structures, their appurtenant canal systems and any reservoir&#13;
storage created to support these facilities required detailed knowledge of the hydrological&#13;
characteristics of the river on which they were placed. Thus, hydrological skills were developed in&#13;
state irrigation departments or public works departments which had responsibility for irrigation.&#13;
Hydrological skills are also required for the design of road and rail systems (particularly their&#13;
bridges), and for the design of hydro-electric schemes.&#13;
1. 19  Surface Water Hydrology. Surface water measurement networks were located originally for&#13;
project planning and design purposes, and measurements were often discontinued after the short-&#13;
term purpose had been achieved. Some early networks were established on major rivers mainly&#13;
for flood warning purposes, and often observed only the iiver stages. Historically, the networks&#13;
were not designed to evaluate the surface water resources of a river basin or sub-basin. While the&#13;
water resources were relatively undeveloped or uncommitted, the lack of total resource information&#13;
had little consequence. But as levels of development of surface water resources have increased and&#13;
conflicts between riparian states and users have emerged. the need for such information has&#13;
grown. Unfortunately the development of the river gauging networks has not been planned, in&#13;
most cases, to meet basin water resource evaluation needs and/or to support basin water planning&#13;
and management.&#13;
1.20 Apart from the relative sparsity of properly located river flow observation stations in many&#13;
basins, a fundamental weakness relates to the practice of hydrometry and the poor quality of the&#13;
data produced, particularly in state agencies. This can be related to many reasons--poorly chosen&#13;
measuring site locations, poor hydrometric practices, inadequately maintained equipment, and&#13;
poorly motivated gauging and supervisory staff among others--but the result has been to place in&#13;
question the validity of the hydrological analyses which used the data. And the sparsity of data&#13;
alone caused design decisions to be made for many projects on the basis of empirical formulae&#13;
relating rainfall (for which long records were available) to runoff.&#13;
1.21  Groundwater Hydrology. The development of skills in groundwater hydrology expanded&#13;
rapidly after the creation of the CGWB in 1972 and the SGOs early in the 1970s. The central and&#13;
state agencies now  have very extensive observationi networks for measuring water level&#13;
fluctuations and water quality.  Though the periodicity of water level observation needs&#13;
improvement in most ot the networks, and pul-pose--bUilt obser-vation tubewells with water level&#13;
recorders are required for key sites. a fundamenital weak-ness is apparent in how hydrological data&#13;
are analyzed to provide estimates of tCe resource available for development (para 1.08).&#13;
1.22  Water Quality. In the Indian peninsula, water pollution monitoring has so far only received&#13;
low-profile attention. and the interest in water qjuality has been concerned mainly with its use for&#13;
irrigation and domestic water supplies.  However, it is now  widely recognized that rapid&#13;
industrialization and urbanization processes, as well as use of fertilizers and pesticides in&#13;
agriculture, will contribute conisiderably to the deteriorationi of the quality of water resources. The&#13;
main government agencies involved in the project with an interest in water quality are CWC,&#13;
CGWB  and the State Irrigation or Water Resources Departments and State Groundwater&#13;
Organizations in the participating states. The Pollution Control Boards (PCB) at central and state&#13;
levels are conceerned with particular aspects of water quality and with imposing the related&#13;
regulations, but the PCBs are not project implementationi agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
Future Challenges in the Water Resources Sector&#13;
1.23 Water Policy. Provision of domestic water supplies for urban and rural populations and&#13;
assuring drinking water supplies for livestock are given first priority under the National Water&#13;
Policy (MOWR, 1987). The document recognizes the water needs of irrigation, hydropower,&#13;
thermal power, industry and navigation and identifies the need to maintain minimum flows on&#13;
rivers for flushing pollutants, maintaining wildlife and other environmental reasons. The policy&#13;
gives irrigation second priority in allocation, but allows that this prioritization might be modified&#13;
with reference to area-specific considerations. As presently developed, the policy paper is&#13;
essentially a guideline. There is a need to evolve more definite criteria for allocation of water&#13;
amongst different users within the framework of the National Water Policy. But proper application&#13;
of such criteria in any specific situation would demand a sound understanding of the available&#13;
water resources and their existing uses supported by reliable hydrological analyses based on&#13;
sufficient and accurate data.&#13;
1.24 Water Resources Planning and Management. Effective planning and coordination of water&#13;
resources development are essential if India's water resources are to be efficiently managed. GOIs&#13;
National Water Policy (para. 1.23) provides a framework guideline for coordinating water&#13;
development for alternative uses and across state boundaries, and it emphasizes the need for river&#13;
basin planning. A recent Bank policy paper on water resource management 1 emphasizes the need&#13;
for development of the resource in the context of a national water strategy which reflects a nation's&#13;
social, economic and environmental objectives. This paper, and the India Irrigation Sector Review&#13;
(Report No. 9518-IN, December 1991), stressed the importance of the river basin as the primary&#13;
unit for planning and management of water resources and for making water allocations to meet&#13;
multi-purpose demands.&#13;
1.25 A major constraint to implementing such policies in India relates to the structure of the&#13;
Federation and the status of water in the Constitution as a state subject (para. 1.10). Even if this&#13;
constraint could be removed, other problems would remain relating to the limited and often&#13;
unreliable water resource data and the absence of clearly defined mechanisms for sharing data&#13;
between states and between users within states. For essentially all river basins in India, data&#13;
collection facilities are inadequate for measuring stream flow, monitoring diversions and storage,&#13;
and monitoring water quality and existing records provide an incomplete basis for planning&#13;
development. Groundwater resource assessments are based on crude water balances which use&#13;
specified norms for balance components which have little relationship to site specific conditions.&#13;
And, moreover, what data is available is not always published and often is not readily accessible&#13;
between the riparian states of a basin or even between departments and other agencies within&#13;
states.&#13;
1.26 Environmental Issues. The Parliament of India has enacted two acts to control pollution of&#13;
water bodies--the Water (Preservation and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974 amended 1988, and&#13;
the Environmental (Protection) Act of 1986. These acts provided for the creation of Central and&#13;
State Pollution Control Boards. They set rules for pollution control and define standards for&#13;
effluent. Other environmental concerns relating to water, such as maintenance of minimum low&#13;
flows on rivers and the preservation of lakes, wetlands and deltas for the protection of wildlife and&#13;
the environment in general, are not clearly defined in law but are covered generally in the National&#13;
Water Policy. However, application of such water environment-related laws and policies and the&#13;
regulations and standards that relate to the laws requires an appropriately designed and operated&#13;
l Water Resource Management; The World Bank, Washington DC, 1993 (A World Bank Policy Paper).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
system for data collection, analysis and dissemination. Yet this is not the case in India, and these&#13;
activities remain scattered and inadequate, and grossly under-funded.&#13;
II. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
Bank Involvement in India's Water Resources Sector&#13;
2.()1 The Bank has supported a wide variety of projects involving development of water&#13;
resources in India since the beginning of its lending operations in the country in the 1950s. By the&#13;
end of 1990, Bank funding had been provided to some 65 projects which had some aspect of water&#13;
resource development or control as their primary purpose. About 42 (65%) of the projects were&#13;
for ilTigation and 13 (20%) were community water supply and/or sanitation projects. In addition, a&#13;
number of urban and rural development projects have had significant water resources development&#13;
components within their broader programs.&#13;
2.02 A feature of many of the projects, particularly in the irrigation subsector, has been the&#13;
inadequacy and inaccuracy of the hydrological analyses which formed the basis on which the&#13;
projects were planned, designed, constructed and subsequently operated. Such analytical failings&#13;
almost all related to the inadequacies of the hydrological data available for computations. Despite&#13;
the known shortcomings of the hydrological analyses and their impact on the actual performances&#13;
of completed projects, the Bank has made only limited attempts through the lending program, to&#13;
improve the hydrometric networks and practice of hydrometry which provide the data on which all&#13;
hydrological analyses are made. Though Bank funding has been commonly used for preparation&#13;
of surface water development projects, the studies rarely emphasized collection of accurate&#13;
hydrometric data for better evaluation of the availability of water resources. The Bank-supported&#13;
Madhya Pradesh Major Irrigation Project (Credit No. 1177-IN, 1982) included a clearly defined&#13;
component for expanding the networks of river gauging and climate observation stations at an&#13;
estimated cost of US$ 8.8 M. But the outcome was less than satisfactory. Only 40% of the&#13;
program was actually completed, mainly because the project authority was predominantly&#13;
concemed with construction of irrigation works and the planned effort to improve the hydrometric&#13;
network was given low priority.&#13;
2.03 The Bank had an influence in causing most of the states of India to establish state&#13;
groundwater organizations (SGOs) with a mandate to evaluate the groundwater resources within&#13;
their jurisdiction. The massive development of groundwater for irrigation by the private sector,&#13;
which was initiated in the 1960s, was supported by the Bank through a series of state and nation-&#13;
wide credit projects. And the scale of the development required the establishment of specialized&#13;
groundwater agencies in the states--a move which the Bank encouraged.&#13;
2.04 Bank involvement with hydrological thinking in India has been closely integrated with the&#13;
development of GOI and state thinking, and has also been paralleled by major analysis and&#13;
reflection by India itself. Of particular note is the GOI and state governments' think-piece on the&#13;
sector termed the "High Level Technical Committee on Hydrology (HILTECH) report prepared in&#13;
1985. This major exercise was steered by the National Institute of Hydrology (NIH) and MOWR&#13;
and included a broad cross spectrum of Indian hydrologists and representatives of all national&#13;
hydrology institutions and water agencies and state governments. The resultant analytical report&#13;
provided a diagnostic of the prevailing situation and future needs and made recommendations&#13;
regarding the future development of the sector encompassing both institutional development needs&#13;
and the technical requirements for a program to upgrade India's hydrological network and service.&#13;
It also recommended assistance from the Bank in the proposed program. Overlapping with the&#13;
HILTECH report preparation was preparation of GOI's "National Water Policy" (NWP) by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
MOWR in 1987. This provided an overall policy framework for the water sector and is an&#13;
important document in providing the policy framework from GOI's side within which HP has been&#13;
prepared. Substantial diSCuSSiOnl iS devoted in the NWP to water and basin planning and the need&#13;
to upgrade hydrological data in order to achieve this. Reflection by the Bank has also been&#13;
intensive (paras 2.12 to 2.15). The broader policy context for thc water sector is addressed in such&#13;
papers as the Bank's "Water Resources Management" policy paper issued in 1993, and, specific to&#13;
India, the 1991 "India, Irrigation Sector Review". Both reports emphasized holistic multi-sectoral&#13;
water planning and allocation and the need for a strong hydrological data base for such work. For&#13;
the hydrology sector itself, a special study - the "Hydrology Sector Review" was undertaken by&#13;
the Bank in collaboration with government in 1987. focussing on three state's (Andhra Pradesh,&#13;
Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh). A comprehensive report was issued in draft and provided an&#13;
important analytical understanding of the sector and its technical and institutional issues. setting the&#13;
stage, along with the policy context documents mentioned above, for the later preparation phase of&#13;
the proposed project.&#13;
Issues and Lessons Learned Regarding Hydrology in India&#13;
2.05 Organizational Issues. Because water resource development in India has been dominated by&#13;
the need to develop irrigation, the historical incentive to collect information on the availability of&#13;
water resources has been in irrigation agencies of both Central and State Governments. As a&#13;
result, the core central agencies responsible for surface water and groundwater hydrology--Central&#13;
Water Commission (CWC) and Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) respectively--are placed&#13;
within the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR), which despite its name, remains dominated by&#13;
interests in irrigation activities and flood protection of agricultural lands. At state levels, surface&#13;
water hydrology is carried out almost exclusively by Irrigation Departments (IDs) or Public Works&#13;
Departments (PWDs) with a major involvement in irrigation (some of which -- for instance,&#13;
Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Orissa -- have changed their names to Water Resources Departments&#13;
(DOWRs) and are broadening their roles in the water sector). The SGOs, regardless of the&#13;
department in which they are located, always have a groundwater development function, with&#13;
irrigation as the main user.&#13;
2.06 As noted (para 1.23). the National Water Policy recognizes the use and demands of water&#13;
for a wide variety of purposes and prioritizes allocations in situations of resource shortage and&#13;
conflict. But, in practice, allocations must be made on the basis of sound evaluations of the total&#13;
resource and the existing commitments which have established user rights on the resource. Such&#13;
hydirological evaluations can be made only by the use of appropriate data bases. In situations of&#13;
conflict or competition, the producers of the data base should be seen as unbiased. Developed&#13;
countries have generally resolved this problem by recognizing comprehensive data collection and&#13;
documentation as an independent function in the water sector and by placing the responsibility with&#13;
a non-user government agency. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) satisfies this&#13;
requirement for hydrometeorological data, and may be seen to provide an unbiased information&#13;
service to the public at large.&#13;
2.07 The time may not be right to separate the responsibility for provision of basic surface water&#13;
and grioundwater hydrological information from the user agencies where it now resides. But a first&#13;
step could be made in the states by creation of free-standing entities within the existing user&#13;
departments to provide clearly-defined hydrological services to all users in government agencies&#13;
and the eligible users in the private sector. Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are taking this step by&#13;
creating hydrology directorates, with responsibility for surface water and groundwater quantity and&#13;
quality, under a Chief Engineer reporting directly to the Engineer in Chief of their Departments of&#13;
Water Resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.08 Development of Specialized Cadres for Surface Water Hydrology. This problem refers to&#13;
the situation in the State Government organizations (essentially irrigation departments) where&#13;
hydrology is not treated as a "specialist" subject. Most hydrological units are staffed with&#13;
generalists civil engineers who are not given specific training in the subject. Posting of&#13;
professional officers tend to be temporary, and they are then posted on to carry out other duties.&#13;
Even when officers have received specialist training in hydrology, there is no certainty that they&#13;
will be used for this work.  Since there are few specialists to set standards, the performance&#13;
expected from supporting technical staff tends to be low, and these staff generally receive&#13;
inadequate formal or on-the-job training. The solution to this problem is evident--specialist&#13;
professional staff should be recruited or existing staff should be given adequate training, and these&#13;
officers should then be provided with a career structure and incentives so that they can be retained&#13;
within hydrology units. This will require creation of a surface water hydrology unit (or.&#13;
preferably, a hydrology unit for both surface water and groundwater) which has a mandate and&#13;
autonomy to develop a staff cadre as suggested.&#13;
2.09 Access to Data Bases. Given that water resources development is a state subject and that all&#13;
the important basins of India have two or more riparian states, it is not surprising that most states&#13;
do not give easy access to the water resource information that they collect, and particularly to&#13;
surface water data. Processed stream flow data in the way of averages or statistical probabilities of&#13;
monthly or annual flows may be available, but the raw data from which these were calculated&#13;
rarely can be obtained. And reliable information on diversions and storage is, in many cases,&#13;
difficult to obtain. Moreover, because the responsibility for collection and storage of hydrological&#13;
data is vested at state levels with major user agencies responsible for irrigation development, the&#13;
basic data produced tends to be regarded as the property of the agency and the concept of providing&#13;
a need-based hydrological service to other users has to be broadened. This is in conformity with&#13;
the National Water Policy which states that'the prime requisite for resource planning is a well&#13;
developed information system' and 'there should be fi-ee exchange of data among the various&#13;
agencies'.&#13;
2.1 0 Quality of the Basic Data. This concerns mainly the surface water data and that collected by&#13;
the state agencies. The methodologies employed for obtaining instantaneous river discharge&#13;
measurements are not standardized, and when procedures are clearly specified they are not always&#13;
followed by the field units. Maintenance of current meters and ancillary equipment is poor, and the&#13;
arrangements for calibration and overhaul of current meters and ancillaries are inadequate. These&#13;
circumstances inevitably result in poor quality data. The situation can be rectified by equipping&#13;
gauging stations with appropriate instruments and ancillary equipment; making proper provision&#13;
foI maintenance of the equipment; training staff to calTy out measurements according to clearly&#13;
defined procedures; and providinig an appropriate system of supervision by properly trained staff&#13;
who are also responsible for validating the measuremenlts and discharge computations.&#13;
2. 1  Financial Constraints. These constraints are felt mainly in inadequate capital investments in&#13;
offices and office equipment, laboratory buildings and equipment, and transport for field staff.&#13;
Recurrent budgets are consumed mainly by personnel emoluments with limited funding for&#13;
hydrological activities and effective maintenance of monitoring equipment. This is most evident in&#13;
some state agencies, and particularly those involved in surface water hydrology. As the latter&#13;
rarely have autonomy, their activities are usually the first to suffer when budgets are constrained.&#13;
The solution lies with creating agencies that are mandated only for hydrological tasks and then&#13;
providing them directly with budgets that are adequate for those tasks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Project Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.12 Government Strategy. GOI regards the core elements of the proposed project as essential&#13;
inputs for implementing the National Water Policy. The policy states 'a standardized national&#13;
information system (for water resources) should be established with a network of data banks and&#13;
data bases, integrating and strengthening the existing Central and State level agencies, and&#13;
improving the quality of data and the processing capabilities '. The longer term aim of GOI is to&#13;
plan development of water resources on the basis of basin units, and the availability of reliable data&#13;
bases which are easily accessible to the planners and other concerned agencies is essential to proper&#13;
execution of this task.&#13;
2.13 Bank Strategy. The Bank's policy paper "Water Resources Management" (1993), covered&#13;
all actions necessary to ensure the equitable, efficient and sustainable development of water&#13;
resources. From within this very broad coverage, the most important concepts that relate directly&#13;
to the objectives of the proposed project are that: water resources should be managed in the context&#13;
of a national water strategy which reflects a nation's social, economic and environmental objectives&#13;
and is based on an assessment of the country's water resources; and achievement of these&#13;
objectives will require development of a comprehensive analytical framework for water resource&#13;
management at the basin, region and national levels. The policy paper recognizes that inadequate&#13;
and unreliable data may constitute a serious constraint to developing and implementing a country's&#13;
water resource strategy and to managing water effectively. The policy paper states:&#13;
'To meet these information needs, countries should: (a) define information requirements for&#13;
national water resources, taking particular account of the multiple demands for water; (b) review&#13;
institutional arrangements linking the providers and users of data; (c) identify and implement new&#13;
mechanisms for funding hydrological services, where such mechanisms are required to provide&#13;
adequatefinancial resources; (d) select appropriate technologies for collecting data, particularlv data&#13;
on water quality and on groundwater, and for implementing user friendly data management&#13;
systems; (e) establish national data banks for information on water resources; and (f) define the&#13;
human resources needed for hydlrological information systems and provide education and training&#13;
to ineet those needs'.&#13;
The major components of the proposed project are in accord with the Bank's requirements for&#13;
improvements to India's capabilities to collect, collate and disseminate information on surface&#13;
water and groundwater hydrology and water quality. Similar recommendations were made in the&#13;
India Irrigation Sector Review (1991) which explained that improved hydrological data was&#13;
essential for improved planning and design of water resource development on a multi sectoral&#13;
basis.&#13;
2.14 The Bank's policy paper indiL ates that Bank lending in the water resources sector will be&#13;
seriously curtailed in countries where governments are not committed to implementation of&#13;
necessary reforms to assure appropriate water resources management capability. It states:&#13;
Progress in implemeniting the priorities identified will be monitored through normal Bank&#13;
interactions with the country. If the absence of adequate progress on priority actions is judged to&#13;
produce serious misuse of resources and to hamper the viability of water-related investments, Bank&#13;
lending in this area will be limited to the provision of potable water to poor households and to&#13;
operations designed to conserve water and protect its quality without additionally drawing on a&#13;
country's water resourcesx.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
Improving the quality and accessibility of hydrological data in India. as proposed under the project,&#13;
would be one of several important priority actions that would have to be undertaken to improve&#13;
India's water resource management capabilities in line with the Bank's policy requirements.&#13;
2.15 Rationale for Bank Involvement. As discussed above (paras 2.12-2.14), the project's&#13;
objectives are in line with India's "National Water Policy" requirements, with the Bank's policy on&#13;
"Water Resources Management". and with the strategy for India's water sector, developed with&#13;
Government, in the "India Irrigation Sector Review". Previous experience indicates that any&#13;
attempt to improve the quality of hydrological data and its availability to users of the data as an add-&#13;
on component of a construction-oriented project is not likely to be successful. A free-standing&#13;
project dedicated primarily to improvement of institutional aspects and staff skills in collection and&#13;
management of hydrological and meteorological data, and the systems by which the data is stored&#13;
and made accessible to users is considered to have a high probability of success. The project's&#13;
main objectives are in line with the Bank's recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No.&#13;
14509-IN, May 19, 1995 discussed on June 20. 1995) which supports the deployment of IDA&#13;
resources in accelerating the development of human resources, and in supporting the sustainable&#13;
use of India's scarce water resources. India's interest in undertaking a hydrology project along the&#13;
lines described in the report should be regarded as a 'window of opportunity' which should not be&#13;
missed.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Concept. Objectives and Scope&#13;
3.01 Project Concept. The project concept is to assist the Central Government and the&#13;
participating State water resource agencies in the development of valid, comprehensive, interactive,&#13;
easily accessed, and user friendly data bases covering all important aspects of the hydrological and&#13;
meteorological cycle, and to the strengthening of the capabilities of the institutions concerned. The&#13;
data bases will therefore cover occurrences of both surface water and groundwater in terms of&#13;
quantity and quality, and hydrometeorological measurements. Provision of the data bases is&#13;
regarded as a service to all legitimate entities involved in management and development of water&#13;
resources, and the range of information stored and its formatting and accessibility will be designed&#13;
to meet the requirements of such users. The project would be supportive of GOI's stated objectives&#13;
under the National Water Policy (para. 1.23), which has been endorsed by the States, of the Bank's&#13;
strategy for India's water sector (expressed in the 1991 Irrigation Sector Review), and of the&#13;
Bank's general policy regarding water resources management and recent CAS published in 1995.&#13;
3.02 The responsibility for development and archiving of the data bases would reside with&#13;
organizations which are, to the extent practically possible, institutionally separated from user&#13;
agencies. Special attention would be paid to standardization of criteria, processes and procedures&#13;
for measurement of hydrological parameters and the arrangements made for storage and retrieval of&#13;
this information so that data series of specific elements would be compatible.&#13;
3.03 Project Objectives. The main objectives of the project would be to improve the institutional&#13;
and organizational arrangements, technical capabilities and physical facilities available for&#13;
measurement, validation, collation, analysis, transfer and dissemination of hydrological,&#13;
hydrometeorological and water quality data, and for basic water resource evaluations within the&#13;
concerned agencies at Central Government level and in the seven participating states. The nature of&#13;
the project would demand significant technical assistance and training to support the improvement&#13;
of institutional and technical capability objectives. The development of the data bases would&#13;
support major aspects of India's National Water Policy, particularly with regard to water allocation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
and planning and management of water resources development at the national, state, basin and&#13;
individual project levels.&#13;
3.04  Project Strategy. The project would be structured as a six-year operation. The first year&#13;
would cover mainly the elaboration and launching of the institutional strengthening program and&#13;
detailed preparation of work programs initiating training programs and procurement. In principle,&#13;
most of the physical works and instrumentation for improving and expanding hydrological and&#13;
hydrometeorological observation networks, water quality laboratories and provision of the&#13;
computing facilities and communication systems for storage and transfer of data would be provided&#13;
during the first three years of the project. This would leave the last three years for testing the data&#13;
collection, storage and transfer systems in function and as a service to the various users of the&#13;
information, and making necessary refinements to the system. However, it is recognized that&#13;
many aspects of the project concept are complex and that implementation rates may differ in&#13;
practice, more than anticipated in some agencies. A 'Process Approach' (para. 5.01) will therefore&#13;
be applied to adequately address these considerations. This process approach provides the&#13;
necessary project implementation flexibility. Progress and proposed annual work programs would&#13;
be subject to an annual review process scheduled to fit with India's budgeting procedures (para&#13;
5.21). Each annual review would be preceded by an Institutional Development Review of States&#13;
and national level workshops to enable the necessary focus on institutional development and user&#13;
needs that are integral to the project. The review process would permit adjustments of&#13;
implementation schedules to reflect user needs, institutional capabilities and actual progress made&#13;
by the concerned agencies, and would allow clients' feedback and lessons learned to be&#13;
incorporated, as necessary, as the project proceeds.&#13;
3.05  Project Scope. The support that the project would provide to the concerned State&#13;
Government and Central agencies may be summarized as follows:&#13;
Project States&#13;
(a) Hydrometry and Data Management&#13;
upgrading and expanding the physical infrastructure for hydrometric activities related to the&#13;
quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater resources and for monitoring of&#13;
hydrometeorological parameters through construction of observation site works and&#13;
buildings, and provisions of measuring instruments and equipment, and laboratory&#13;
facilities;&#13;
-     upgrading systems for collection, validation and processing of data on reservoir operations&#13;
and river diversions and return flows from surface water diversions and on groundwater&#13;
withdrawals, through the provisions of buildings and measuring instruments and&#13;
equipment;&#13;
-     upgrading and standardization of data management facilities by establishment of&#13;
computerized data banks for the storage and retrieval, analysis and dissemination of data&#13;
related to the quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater resources and for&#13;
monitoring of hydrometeorological parameters, including provision of equipment and&#13;
buildings;&#13;
-     provision of communication systems, including equipment and services to inter-connect the&#13;
project computerized data centers;&#13;

The project activities are summarized below (management features at Chapter V) and described in&#13;
thematic Annexes 3 to 11 of this report and the detailed work programs and the related implementation&#13;
schedules of the participating agencies are given in the Annexes.&#13;
B. Detailed Features of the Project&#13;
Surface Water Hydrology (US$ 31.3 million, 22.0 % of base cost)&#13;
3.06  Upgrading and Expansion of River Flow Observation Facilities (Annex 3). The CWC&#13;
maintains a nation-wide network for measuring river flow characteristics in all major basins. State&#13;
agencies maintain networks on river systems which flow within their jurisdictions. Most stations are&#13;
permanently manned. At most regular gauging stations, measurements are made of the river stage&#13;
level using a staff gauge and of the instantaneous discharge by current metering. Continuous records&#13;
of river stage are collected at some stations using a water level recorder installed in a stilling well.&#13;
Some observation sites are equipped to sample the stream flow for measurement of the suspended&#13;
sediment load and/or to determine the chemical quality of the water. Some state agencies maintain&#13;
stations where only stage level is observed and discharge is computed from a rating curve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
3.07 The project would upgrade and expand the river flow observation networks in the participating&#13;
states. This would include improvements to the existing stations in the CWC and state agency&#13;
networks by provision of additional, or replacement of existing, measuring equipment, and by&#13;
expansion of all the state agency networks by installation of new stations. To finalize the annual work&#13;
programs, provision is made for carrying out some additional survey, investigation and design of the&#13;
existing and new networks. The existing networks in the participating states comprise 235 stations&#13;
maintained by CWC and some 787 stations under the concerned state agencies. The total number of&#13;
stations under state agencies would be increased to about 1096 under the project. Annex 1, Table 1&#13;
shows a breakdown of the above totals by states, agencies and parameters observed for the existing&#13;
and improved observation networks.&#13;
3.08 Every observation station has site specific characteristics relating to the river geometry, the range&#13;
of flow conditions to be observed, and how measurements are made. Where available and&#13;
appropriate, bridge sites are used for making measurements. At other locations, cableways with winch&#13;
and cradle or boat are installed or powered boats are used independently on large rivers. Flow velocity&#13;
measurements are typically made using standard cup-type current meters. Propeller-type current&#13;
meters are required when velocities are very high. Pigmy-type current meters are used to measure low&#13;
velocities where river depths are very shallow and observations can be made by wading. River depth&#13;
measurements may be made by sounding rods or echo sounders, as appropriate. Punjab-type&#13;
samplers are most commonly used for taking samples for suspended sediment analyses. The types of&#13;
measuring instruments and other equipment for improvement and expansion of the CWC and state&#13;
agency river flow and sediment observation networks are shown with cost estimates in Annex 2. Table&#13;
2, Part A, discussed in general in Annex 3 of this report, and for individual agencies in Annexes 15,&#13;
and 20 to 26.&#13;
3.09 Improvements to Surface Water Laboratory Facilities (Annex 5). Four basic types of laboratory&#13;
facilities are recognized: (a) Level I laboratories which are located at flow gauging sites where&#13;
chemical quality of the water is monitored and equipped to measure unstable parameters - EC, pH,&#13;
total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature (one laboratory may serve two&#13;
or three sites); (b) Level II laboratories are equipped to analyze water samples for some 29 basic&#13;
parameters covering the main cations and anions and general water characteristics; (c) Level II+&#13;
laboratories have capabilities for analyses of heavy metals and organic micro-pollutants in addition to&#13;
the basic parameters measured by Level II facilities; and (d) Level Ti laboratories with similar capacity&#13;
to Level II+, but with more advanced and accurate equipment.&#13;
3.10  The CWC has established 131 river gauging stations in the project area where water quality is&#13;
monitored and, in principle, these sites should be equipped with Level I laboratory facilities. The&#13;
Commission has eleven Level II laboratories in the project area. These are located with divisional&#13;
offices of which eight are under the jurisdiction of the South Central Region and three under the&#13;
Southern Region. The facility buildings are generally inadequate and most of the equipment has&#13;
exceeded its useful life. With the exception of Maharashtra, the state agencies concerned with river&#13;
flow hydrometry have made limited provisions for systematic collection of water quality data or&#13;
development of their own laboratory facilities.&#13;
3.1 1 Provisions are made under the project to improve CWC's surface water quality monitoring&#13;
capability by providing equipment sets and building for 75 Level I laboratories, nine Level II&#13;
laboratories, and one each of Level II+ and III laboratories. All the facilities will be replacement items&#13;
for existing facilities which are regarded as inadequate. The concerned agencies in the participating&#13;
states would be provided with 78 Level I, eight Level II and one Level II+ laboratories, most of which&#13;
require new buildings. In addition, 11 Level II and two Level II+ laboratories will be shared with&#13;
groundwater organizations. The distribution of laboratories between the state agencies are shown by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Annex 1, Table 2. Details of the equipment provisions for each type. of laboratory are given in Annex&#13;
2, Table 2, Sheets 7-8. Analyses to be carried out by each type of laboratory are discussed in Annex&#13;
5.&#13;
3.12 Monitoring of Reservoir Operations. Diversions and Return Flows. A surface water data base&#13;
for a river basin would be incomplete without information on storage, releases and diversions at&#13;
reservoirs, on diversions from rivers at barrages, weirs and pumping stations, and on return flows of&#13;
used water to the river system. The operating agencies at reservoirs and river diversion structures&#13;
usually maintain fairly good records of water movements at their facilities. In this situation, the task of&#13;
the agency concerned with surface water hydrology would be to devise and implement a process for&#13;
collecting (and validating) the data from the operating agencies. The information could then be&#13;
incorporated in the project data bases.&#13;
3. 13 Estimation of return flows from irrigation diversions presents a complex problem. Waste water&#13;
returns by way of natural and artificial drains can include both return flow and excess rainfall runoff.&#13;
Effluent groundwater to the surface water system may include both natural groundwater outflows and&#13;
return flows of used water by way of the groundwater system. In general, serious attempts have not&#13;
been made in India to quantify return flows to river systems from irrigation diversions, which&#13;
constitute by far the largest use of surface water.&#13;
3.14 Most of the participating states have made proposals for improving their monitoring systems for&#13;
reservoir operations. These involve provision of instrumentation to provide more accurate information&#13;
on reservoir storage and on releases to the river and to canals. Several states have proposed pilot&#13;
projects to obtain estimates of return flows from surface water irrigation schemes. The proposals&#13;
typically entail stream gauging operations on key elements of the natural drainage system which&#13;
evacuates waste water from an irrigation command area. The studies are described for individual states&#13;
in Annexes 20 - 26. Provision is made under the project to support implementation of the above&#13;
activities, and developing the water balances by which return flows will be evaluated will be supported&#13;
as an R&amp;D activity (Annex 8).&#13;
3. 15 Establishment of Flood Forecasting Systems. Flood forecasting is a specialized activity of&#13;
hydrological science in that it demands that rainfall, river flow and any existing reservoir performance&#13;
data be analyzed for a river basin or sub-basin on a real-time basis during a flood event. This requires&#13;
secure and often dedicated communication systems--radio or space satellite--for data transmission to&#13;
the flood forecasting center where computer models may be used to integrate and analyze incoming&#13;
data on a continuous basis through the event.&#13;
3.16 Provision of a real-time flood warning system in Orissa for the Brahmani river delta and for&#13;
operation of the Rengali reservoir would be supported under the project (Annex 26). In the first stage,&#13;
the observation network would cover only the two thirds of the basin area located in Orissa, but&#13;
provision would be made for a future extension of the network into the upper basin in Bihar. The&#13;
telemetry would communicate river flow measurements at selected stations in the basin in real-time to a&#13;
data analysis center. And the project would support development of a flood forecasting model for the&#13;
Brahmani river system. The project would also provide wireless communications equipment and&#13;
necessary buildings to enhance the flood forecasting capabilities of the surface water organizations in&#13;
Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, and a consultancy input is provided for the&#13;
development of a flood forecasting model for the Tambraparani river system in Tamil Nadu.&#13;
3.17 Reservoir Sedimentation Surveys This type of activity does not fall strictly within the broad&#13;
objectives of the project to develop hydrological data bases with the concerned agencies in the project&#13;
area. Nevertheless, the need to undertake sedimentation surveys in reservoirs was given a high&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
priority by all but one (Madhya Pradesh) of the participatincg states. The project would therefore&#13;
support such activities.&#13;
3.18  The proposed programs for reservoir sedimentation surveys vary in scale between states.&#13;
Equipment items required include: motor powered boats with trailers and vehicles for road transport;&#13;
electronic and standard surveying equipment; trisponder satellite positioning equipment; echosounding&#13;
equipment; sediment sampling and analysis sets; digital planinmeters; and walkie talkie communication&#13;
sets. Computers and ancillaries are provided for computationis and graphics A list of equipment for&#13;
this project component is given with detailed cost estimates in Annex 2, Table 1.&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology (US$ 29.8 million, 21.0 % of base cost)&#13;
3.19 Improvement and Expansion of Groundwater Observation Facilities (Annex 4). The CGWB&#13;
has established a nation-wide network at about 16,000 locations for observation of groundwater level&#13;
changes and taking water quality samples, and about 8.700 of the monitoring sites are in the&#13;
participating states. The SGOs of the participating states have developed their own groundwater&#13;
monitoring networks to provide some 19,475 observation sites. Thus, within the project area of about&#13;
0.98 M km2, groundwater level observations are being made at some 31,090 locations, giving an&#13;
average network density of about 60 km2/site.&#13;
3.20 The observation points are predominantly hand dug, open wells which are not owned by the&#13;
monitoring agencies--tubewells represent only about six percent of all observation points. Except for a&#13;
few, relatively small areas, the networks are designed to monitor the phreatic aquifer systems which&#13;
provide by far the greatest proportion of the groundwater used for irrigation. Water levels are&#13;
measured manually, except for a few tubewell locations where autographic water level recorders have&#13;
been installed. Throughout the CGWB network, water levels are measured during fixed ten-day&#13;
periods in January, May, August and November. State agencies follow individual practices--Tamil&#13;
Nadu makes monthly measurements; in Andhra Pradesh, observation intervals by department staff&#13;
range from twice yearly in most of the network to bimonthly or monthly in a few wells; Maharashtra&#13;
and Madhya Pradesh make measurements four times a year; Gujarat mainly makes pre- and post-&#13;
monsoon measurements; most of Orissa's network is measured only pre-monsoon; and Kerala's&#13;
network is measured only pre-monsoon. The CGWB and most state agencies sample their networks&#13;
for water quality immediately prior to the monsoon, but the Oiissa and Madhya Pradesh agencies have&#13;
yet to start systematic monitoring of water quality.&#13;
3.21 The use of privately owned, open wells for water level and water quality observations has&#13;
become an increasing problem. Some tend to go dry before the end of the dry season and others fall&#13;
into disrepair after being abandoned by their owners. Both situations can cause the loss of an&#13;
important observation site. The CGWB has had the intention to gradually replace open well&#13;
observation sites by purpose-built observation tubewells, but has yet to make significant progress in&#13;
this respect. The Karnataka state agency is adopting this practice.  The project provides for&#13;
replacement of key open well observation sites by purpose-built tubewells.&#13;
3.22 As noted (para 3.20), the existing networks were designed mainly for monitoring the shallow&#13;
aquifers which support most of the irrigation development. This will remain a priority, and provision&#13;
is made under the project for strengthening these networks by providing additional or replacement&#13;
observation tubewells. However, deeper aquifers are being exploited increasingly for community&#13;
water supplies, municipalities and irrigation. Sometimes this exploitation is in fragile situations with&#13;
complex water quality relationships adjacent to the coast. In these circumstances, networks of&#13;
properly designed observation tubewells are required to monitor piezometric relationships and changes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
in the deeper aquifers and/or water quality relationships. The pri-Ject provides for such network&#13;
improvements.&#13;
3.23 The present practice of relying mainly on manual measurements of water levels can produce data&#13;
of questionable accuracy for a variety of reasons. Moreover. the intervals between measurements of&#13;
levels on the CGWB networks and many of the state agency networks (para 3.20) result, at best, in a&#13;
very crude hydrograph and, at worst, in a poor indication of high or low water levels. The provision&#13;
of purpose-built observation wells in the CGWB and state agency networks makes installation of&#13;
automatic water level recorders a practical proposition at appropriate observation sites where&#13;
reasonable security can be assured. Autographic recorders with a float and clock mechanism have long&#13;
been manufactured in India, but such instruments have well known problems for use on tubewells.&#13;
However. a battery powered, digital recorders with a hand-held electronic instrument for data transfer&#13;
to a computer are now being manufactured in India. As the probe of the digital instrument can be&#13;
inserted in a smaller diameter observation well than that required to take the float of an autographic&#13;
recorder, this results in a comparative cost saving. Digital water level recorders would be provided to&#13;
enhance the quality of the hydrometric data from selected sites in the CGWB and state agency&#13;
networks.&#13;
3.24 The improved CGWB network in the project area would comprise about 8,800 observation sites&#13;
of which some 2,500 (28%) would be observation tubewells of which about 1,700 would be equipped&#13;
with digital water level recorders. State agency networks would comprise about 20,500 observation&#13;
sites of which some 5,242 (26%) sites would be observation tubewells, and digital water level&#13;
recorders would be installed at about 3,790 of the tubewell sites. To finalize the annual GW work&#13;
programs, provision is made for carrying out some additional survey, investigation and design of the&#13;
existing and new networks. Annex 1, Table 1 B, shows a breakdown of the above totals by state area,&#13;
agency and type of observation site for the existing and improved groundwater monitoring networks.&#13;
Cost estimates for tubewells and recorders to be provided for CGWB and the SGOs are discussed in&#13;
Annexes 16 and 20 to 26. Details of the monitoring facilities are discussed in Annex 4.&#13;
3.25 Field Measuring Equipment for Monitoring. All observers involved in maintaining the&#13;
groundwater monitoring networks must be equipped with field instruments such as water level&#13;
sounders (biaxial electric tapes), portable EC and pH meters and thermometers. These instruments&#13;
should be a personal issue. Provision is made under the project for supply of the instruments in the&#13;
required quantities for use by the regional office staff of CGWB and by the state agencies. Portable&#13;
compressors or portable generators with submersible pumps are also provided for obtaining&#13;
unstagnated samples for water quality analyses from observation tubewells&#13;
3.26 Improvements to Groundwater Laboratory Facilities (Annex 5). The CGWB has established&#13;
laboratories at all 12 of its regional headquarters, with the facilities at Lucknow being designated the&#13;
central laboratory of the organization under a Director. The central laboratory is intended to have full&#13;
Level III capabilities to carry out analyses relating to heavy metal and micro-organic pollution. The&#13;
remaining eleven regional laboratories (of which seven are in the project area) are intended to have&#13;
Level II capabilities. Much of the equipment in all the laboratories has low serviceability and has&#13;
passed its useful life. Moreover, some of the buildings in which the work is now carried out are&#13;
inappropriate. The creation of a CGWB regional office at Madras with responsibility for operations in&#13;
Tamil Nadu (para 5.04) will require the establishment of a laboratory facility to serve this office. The&#13;
CGWB Training and Research Institute to be established at Raipur (para 3.45) will also require a Level&#13;
I11 laboratory to support both its training and research activities.&#13;
3.27 Provisions are made under the project to improve the laboratory facilities at the 12 existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
regional headquarters of CGWB2 and for the establishment of a laboratory to serve a newly created&#13;
regional office at Madras. The central laboratory at Lucknow will be fully equipped up to Level III&#13;
capability, and thus able to undertake a wide range of pollution related analyses. Reflecting the&#13;
growing need for water pollution investigations in all the regions, the remaining regional laboratories&#13;
wil each be provided with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and gas chromatograph to enable&#13;
some anorganic and organic pollution analyses, in addition to the standard equipment required for&#13;
Level II laboratories to upgrade them to Level 11+. The quantities of equipment to be provided assume&#13;
that most existing equipments require replacement. Provision is also made for improvement to existing&#13;
laboratory buildings and provision of a new laboratory building in Madras.&#13;
3.28 The SGOs of the seven participating states have each established several laboratory facilities.&#13;
The standards of these facilities vary widely. Only a few can presently function as Level II facilities,&#13;
although that is their intended standard. Most of the equipment has exceeded its useful life, and many&#13;
of the buildings are unsuitable for laboratory work.&#13;
3.29 The project will upgrade 32 laboratories established by the SGOs of the participating states and&#13;
provide four additional facilities for Madhya Pradesh and two in Kerala. Under proposed&#13;
reorganizations in Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to establish water resource departments, 12&#13;
facilities (eight in Madhya Pradesh and four in Tamil Nadu) will be used to provide information on the&#13;
quality of both surface water and groundwater. The remaining 26 laboratories will be used exclusively&#13;
for groundwater analyses. One laboratory in each state, located in the state capital, will be upgraded to&#13;
Level II+ category with equipment for pollution investigations. The remaining laboratories will be&#13;
upgraded to Level II facilities. It has been assumed that most existing equipment requires replacement.&#13;
Provision is also made for constructing 12 new laboratory buildings replacing 13 existing laboratory&#13;
buildings and for improvements to the remaining seven laboratory buildings. The distribution between&#13;
agencies and states of the laboratories to be provided is shown in Table 2 of Annex 1. Details of&#13;
equipments to be provided and analyses to be carried out at each laboratory type are given in Annex 5.&#13;
Hydrometeorologv (US$ 4.2 million, 3.0 % of base cost)&#13;
3.3() The IMD, CWC and various state agencies (including all the state agencies involved in surface&#13;
water hydrometry excepting Orissa) have established networks to measure rainfall. All rainfall stations&#13;
are equipped with standard rain gauges (SRG) and provide daily rainfall data. A relatively small&#13;
proportion (18%) of the rainfall stations are also equipped with] autographic rain gauges which provide&#13;
infoTmation on rainfall intensity and duration. The IMD maintains a network of climatological stations&#13;
which are fully equipped to World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standards with eye-reading&#13;
and autographic instruments for observation of all standard climatic parameters, including rainfall. The&#13;
state agencies involved in surface water hydrometry in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have also&#13;
established climatic station networks. In addition to observing rainfall, the stations are generally&#13;
equipped to measure parameters for calculation of evapotranspiration. However, equipment&#13;
provisions are variable. Gujarat has installed five automatic weather recording stations equipped with&#13;
rainfall, wind speed and direction, solar radiation, temperature, humidity and evaporation measuring&#13;
sensors, and Orissa is in the process of procuring three such facilities for installation at remote sites.&#13;
3.31  Table I of Annex 6 lists the numbers and types of rainfall and climate observation stations&#13;
maintained by the agencies in each participating state, and indicates the improvement to the networks&#13;
proposed to be undertaken by the project. It should be noted that the improvements proposed relate to&#13;
the networks maintained by CWC and the state agencies responsible for surface water hydrometry.&#13;
2  The need for improvements to laboratories at the five facilities located outside the project area is as critical as that of&#13;
the laboratories in CGWB Regional Offices located within the project area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
The proposed improvements cover both the rain gauging and manned climate station networks, and in&#13;
Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu include installation of automatic weather recording stations. The project&#13;
also makes provision for repair/replacement of faulty equipment at existing observation sites. Because&#13;
of the unknowns related to the existing hydrometeorological facilities not under IMD control, provision&#13;
is made for carrying out some additional survey, investigation and design of the existing network of&#13;
climatological stations and rainfall gauges.&#13;
3.32 Upgrading of Calibration Facilities. The CWPRS and the IMD have facilities to test and&#13;
calibrate scientific instruments used for hydrometric and hydrometeorological measurements.&#13;
Provision is made under the project to upgrade and improve these facilities to improve the quality of&#13;
the work undertaken and to reflect the increased numbers of instruments which will have to be testing&#13;
and calibrated on a routine basis.&#13;
Upgrading of Data Management Facilities (Annex 7) (US$ 18.8 million, 13.0 % of base cost)&#13;
3.33 General. This component would upgrade and improve data management systems employed by&#13;
the CWC, CGWB and the state agencies responsible for collection and storage of water quantity and&#13;
quality data relating to surface water and groundwater resources and of rainfall and climatic data using&#13;
computerized systems. The IMD has a well established computerized system for handling the rainfall&#13;
and climate data that it processes, but additional computing facilities will be provided for the national&#13;
data center at Pune and for the meteorological centers covering the participating states.&#13;
3.34 The CWC makes fairly extensive use of computers for storage and processing of the&#13;
hydrometric data collected from its river gauging networks. Raw stream flow data are processed at&#13;
divisional offices on computers using software developed by CWC, and the processed data are then&#13;
transferred upwards on diskettes for storage on computers at the concerned regional offices and at&#13;
CWC headquarters. The CGWB makes use of computers for storage and retrieval of raw groundwater&#13;
data collected from its observation network in the regional and headquarters offices. The historical data&#13;
is in the process of being computerized. In general, the state agencies responsible for surface water&#13;
hydrometry have made only Limited advances in using computers for data storage and processing. In&#13;
contrast, several of the SGOs of the participating states have stored their groundwater observation&#13;
network data on computers and have some programs for data processing. However, the data storage&#13;
and retrieval systems that have been set up by the cenitral and state agencies are rarely compatible.&#13;
3.35 Establishment of Data Banks. The project plans to develop computerized data banks within&#13;
CWC, CGWB and the state agencies responsible lor surface water and groundwater hydrology&#13;
respectively. Thus, each agenicy will have a data banking system for the data it collects. This places&#13;
responsibility for verifying data and maintainiing the integrity of the information with the collecting&#13;
agency. However, the agencies will use the same progr-ams for data storage. Communication linkages&#13;
(satellite or land line) will be provided, as appropriate, so that data can be exchanged between&#13;
concer-ned agencies by electronic file transter. To this degree. the data bases would be semi-&#13;
interactive.&#13;
3.36  Computerization) of the CWC data storage and processing system would start at the sub-&#13;
divisional level which is where raw data first accumulates. The computer facility at the sub-division&#13;
will be used for storage of verified raw data of iiver flows and processing of this data. Copies of this&#13;
entire data base will be transferred by a dial-up NICNET linkage, or by diskette, to the controlling&#13;
divisional office for further verificationi. Copies of the processed data will then be transferred by&#13;
diskette or dial-up satellite commullication to the controllinig circle and regional offices. Each regional&#13;
office would create a data banking system  cover-ing all surface water resources and&#13;
hydrometeorological information collected by CWC units under its jurisdiction. Copies of regional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
office data bases would be transferred upwards to CWC headqualters by a satellite communication link&#13;
as part of the central surface water data bank.&#13;
3.37  The CGWB will establish computerized girotundwater data banks for storage and processing of&#13;
data collected by each of the regional offices. In cases where the r eglonial office has a subordinate unit&#13;
office, that office will be provided with computer facilities ftor storage and processing of all data&#13;
actually collected. Copies of this information will be transfelred into the regional offices' data banks&#13;
by a dial-up NICNET linkage or by diskette. Copies of the data bases held in regionial office banks&#13;
will be transferred upwards to CGWB headquarters by a satellite communiication link to form the&#13;
central groundwater data bank.&#13;
3.38 For the establishment of data banking systems for the surface water and groundwater&#13;
information collected by state agencies, entry of verified data into a computerized storage system will&#13;
normally be undertaken at divisional office level or equivalent. Copies of this information will then be&#13;
transferred by a dial-up NICNET linkage or by diskette to the headquarters of the state agencies to be&#13;
incorporated into the state water data banking system. The sul'iace water and groundwater data bankine&#13;
systems will be separate in all states even when the activities are canied out within a single Hydrology&#13;
Unit, as in Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.&#13;
3.39 Hardware and Software for Data Centers. Similar computing facilities will be provided for the&#13;
data centers to be established in the headquarters of CWC and CGWB. The computer hardware will&#13;
be a network system based on a file server for data storage and retrieval connected to eight PCs and&#13;
with provision for connection to additional PCs. The system would run the specialized hydrology and&#13;
water quality data management programs selected for use in the water data centers and other&#13;
appropriate hydrology program and general purpose applications. Ancillary equipment would include&#13;
monitors, digitizers, scanners and plotters to assist in the production of maps - this is of particular&#13;
importance for the data center established at CGWB headquarters.&#13;
3.40 The computing facilities provided for the CGWB regional offices and the state centers for&#13;
suiface water and groundwater data will have similar capabilities. The computer hardware will also be&#13;
a network system based on a file server connected to five PCs with provisions for connection of&#13;
additional PCs. The system would run the specialized hydrology and water quality data management&#13;
programs selected for use in the data centers and other hydrology program and general purpose&#13;
applications. Ancillary equipment to assist with map and graphics production would be provided for&#13;
the CGWB regional office and the state agency facilities. The CWC regional offices will be provided&#13;
with a pair of PCs plus ancillaries, such as plotter and printers, plus surface water and water quality&#13;
data management programs and other specialized hydrology and general purpose software.&#13;
3.41 Divisional offices of the CWC and of the state organizations will enter verified data into&#13;
computer systems for storage and tranisfer to data banks (paras 3.36-3.38). In CWC and in some state&#13;
agencies, there are intermediate command levels between the data collection units and the level at which&#13;
the data banks are established. These need to have computerized filing systems for storage of data&#13;
collected within their jurisdiction. All data collecting and intermediate offices would be provided with&#13;
two PCs of appropriate capacity, printers and data management software suitable to the function of the&#13;
office. Where unit offices of CGWB regions exist, they will be provided with similar computing&#13;
facilities. Two PCs of appropriate capacity would be provided in all laboratories of Level II or Level&#13;
II+ (paras 3.09 and 3.22), together with a printer and software appropriate for use in water quality data&#13;
management. Level III laboratoijes will have enhanced computing and ancillary facilities.&#13;
3.42 Communication Networks for Data Transfer. Data transfer between central, regional and state&#13;
water data banks would be by satellite communication using India's NICNET system. Data transfer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
from computerized offices the data banking centers would also use the NICNET system with a backup&#13;
using diskettes (para 3.34).&#13;
3.43 The CWC headquarters in New Delhi, being the location of the central surface water data bank,&#13;
will be provided with a NICNET ground station to provide communication links to its regional offices&#13;
in Hyderabad and Coimbatore and to the surface water data banks with the concerned agencies of the&#13;
participating states in Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad, Madras, Bangalore, Nasik, Trivandrum, Ahmedabad&#13;
and Bhopal. All major cities in India now have a NICNET ground station. These stations will be used&#13;
for linking the CWC regional office and state agency data banking systems to CWC's central system.&#13;
The CWC regional offices and the state surface water data centers will be provided with modems and&#13;
dedicated telephone lines to the NICNET ground stations. The CGWB headquarters at Faridabad&#13;
would be provided with a NICNET ground station to establish linkages with all of its regional offices&#13;
and with the headquarters of the SGOs in the eight participating states. The CGWB regional office and&#13;
the SGO groundwater data centers would be linked to the local NICNET groundstation through a&#13;
modem and dedicated land telephone line.&#13;
3.44 All data collection and processing offices below CWC and CGWB regional data centers and&#13;
below state surface water and groundwater data centers would communicate with superior offices&#13;
using a dial-up modem connection to their local NICNET groundstation. If dial up access lines are not&#13;
available or are of poor quality, data would be transferred by diskette.&#13;
Research and Development Activities (Annex 8) (US$ 1.1 million, 1.0 % of base cost)&#13;
3.45 The NIH is an apex agency of the Central Government funded through MOWR with a mandate&#13;
that places strong emphasis on hydrological research. The CWPRS has practical hydrological research&#13;
capabilities and has particular expertise with respect to specialized instruments for surface water&#13;
hydrometry. The CWC and the state agencies responsible for surface water data collection undertake&#13;
very limited hydrology research that relates directly to project objectives. By contrast, the CGWB and&#13;
some of the SGOs of the participating states undertake groundwater research works, in addition to&#13;
their routine exploratory drilling, hydrogeological mapping and resource evaluation activities.&#13;
Moreover, the CGWB is establishing a National Institute for Groundwater Research and Training&#13;
(NIGRT) at Raipur., and funding to support this undertaking would be provided under the project.&#13;
3.46 The Hydrology Project (HP) would support demand driven applied research in all relevant&#13;
aspects of surface water and groundwater hydrology and of water quality through funding specifically&#13;
identified research studies which are approved by a Research and Development Evaluation Committee&#13;
(RDEC) to be established under the project. The evaluation process is aimed at the applied research&#13;
activities that may be undertaken by NIH, CWPRS, or any other qualified research agency, on behalf&#13;
of the central and state surface water and groundwater organizations using funds provided by the&#13;
project.&#13;
3.47 As most of the applied research activities to be undertaken using project funds have yet to be&#13;
fully identified and approved by the RDEC, the funding for these activities is covered by a lump sum&#13;
allocation of some Rs. 40.0 million (excluding physical and price contingencies) in the project budget.&#13;
Some Rs. 5.0 and 15.0 million respectively support the NIH and CWPRS for their on-going R&amp;D&#13;
programs. The remaining Rs. 20.0 million will be placed in a project applied research fund to be&#13;
drawn on by qualified research agencies when a proposed study on behalf of a central or state agency&#13;
has been approved by the evaluation committee and confirmed by the Bank. Some applied research&#13;
inputs to be undertaken by CGWB and the SGOs have been identified and their fundings are specified&#13;
in the detailed cost estimates for the specific agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
Institutional Support (Annex 9) (US$ 46.2 million, 31% of base cost)&#13;
3.48 The recipients of institutional support will be central and state surface water and groundwater&#13;
agencies. Institutional capability needs to be strengthened for organization and management in general&#13;
and, in particular, for survey, investigation and design, and for the collection, validation, storage and&#13;
dissemination of data (Annex 7). An incentive structure would be developed conducive to sustainable&#13;
professional performance. Methods of supervision and quality control must be strengthened as well,&#13;
to ensure data validity. Appropriate skills would have to be developed to operate the computing and&#13;
laboratory facilities provided by the project and to maintain the expanded hydrometric networks. A&#13;
high level of inter-agency coordination would be required for development of computerized data banks&#13;
which are inter-active between data centers, and readily accessible by the concerned agencies and other&#13;
legitimate users in the public and private sectors.&#13;
3.49 The project would finance institutional strengthening costs directly related to implementation and&#13;
administration of programs undertaken departmentally and through local consultants' services (for&#13;
some SID activities). For the first three years of the project period, almost all incremental operating&#13;
costs relate to organizational strengthening, staffing and support for project implementation. It is&#13;
anticipated that, from the fourth year of the project period, incremental operating costs would relate&#13;
mainly to routine operation of the upgrading and expanded observation networks and data processing&#13;
facilities. The incremental O&amp;M costs would be supported on a declining scale, including project staff&#13;
and other inputs to support the new institutional initiatives to be undertaken under the project and&#13;
training programs. To ensure sustainability of hydrological activities in the future after external&#13;
financing is withdrawn, Bank funding of O&amp;M costs would be phased out during the project period&#13;
and substituted by government funding of O&amp;M. An assurance was obtained from GOI and the&#13;
participating states that they would provide in a timely manner all the funds needed for O&amp;M of the&#13;
project. This funding would reflect the phasing-out of Bank funding and provide full O&amp;M funding&#13;
once Bank support is withdrawn. The O&amp;M support would include provision of: office facilities,&#13;
equipment and services; vehicles and their operational costs; consultancy services; and project-specific&#13;
staff training.&#13;
Training (Annex 10) (US$ 5.9 million,4.0 % of base cost).&#13;
3.50   The project would provide both formal training and on-the-job training, particularly for state&#13;
agencies. Though most of the training would be carried out by trained staff of the national and state&#13;
agencies. The NIH, CWPRS. IMD and the training consultants (para 3.51) would assist in running&#13;
courses for training of trainers. The project would assist the CWC in the establishment of an academy&#13;
for teaching surface water hydrology which would become a source of training under the project for&#13;
professionals involved in surface water hydrology and hydrometry. The project would also support&#13;
CGWB in the establishment of a groundwater research and training institute which is expected to&#13;
become the main source of training for professional staff in hydrogeology. Sub-professional staff&#13;
would be given formal training in groundwater hydrology through courses which could be run using&#13;
the facilities of the several Water and Land Management Institutes (WALMIs) in the project area.&#13;
Specialized consultant services (para 3.51) would be directly employed on training-specific&#13;
assignments. Provision is also made for training fellowships in foreign and Indian institutions,&#13;
advaniced training in NIH, and for study tours in India and abroad.&#13;
Consultancy Services (Annex  11) (US$ 7.9 million, 5.4 % of base cost)&#13;
3.51 Consultancy services would be employed to assist the project implementation agencies at&#13;
national, regional and state levels. Local consultant services would be employed to assist in the&#13;
survey, investigation and design of project works, facilities and services. In addition, the main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
consultants' services would consist of general technical assistance for project implementation, and&#13;
specific assistance in the project training activities (Annex I 1). The consultancy would be a joint&#13;
team of about 251 foreign consultant months and some 709 local consultant months of which about&#13;
162 foreign and 596 local consultant months would be for general project assistance and 89 foreign&#13;
and 1 13 local consultant months would be for training. The arrangements, specializations and&#13;
scheduling for the consultancy are discussed in Annex 11. Further elaboration of international and&#13;
national consultancy details and adjustment as needed would be made during the "project launch"&#13;
mission and in annual reviews. The main consultant teams would be based in New Delhi. They&#13;
would be required to visit the participating states to support the local consultants posted in the capital&#13;
of each participating state to work with concerned state agencies and regional offices of the national&#13;
agencies. An assurance was obtained from GOI that it would employ consultant services, not later&#13;
than March 31, 1996 to assist with the implementation and supervision of the project, under terms&#13;
of referenice satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
3.52 The main tasks of the general assistance consultanits would include: (a) general assistance to&#13;
the project coordination group and the national and state agencies involved, in both institutional&#13;
development and technical areas; (b) standardization of technical criteria and procedures relating to&#13;
all aspects of hydrometry including water quality and suspended sediment; (c) review/preparation of&#13;
specifications for specialized equipment items to be procured under the project; (d) selection of&#13;
hardware and software for data storage systems and other hydrological applications; (e) devising&#13;
methods and criteria by which historical stream flow data may be adjusted and improved; (f) review&#13;
of annual work programs; and (g) monitoring of project progress. The training consultants would be&#13;
concernied mainly with preparation of training course curricular, preparation of seminars and&#13;
workshops, provision of formal training of trainers from state agencies, and monitoring the&#13;
effectiveness of training activities. Local consultanits posted with the states would have similar duties&#13;
to support the state surface water and groundwater agencies.  Short-term foreign and local&#13;
constultants would be employed on special training and other technical assistance assignments.&#13;
C. Status ot Preparation and Implementation Schedule&#13;
3.53  Status of Preeparatiotn. T he project has been prepared by the central and state government&#13;
agencies concernied, steered by MOWR, CWC and CGWB and with the assistance of the Bank,&#13;
FAO/CP. the UK's Overseas Development Agency (ODA) and the Netherland's Directorate General&#13;
for Inter-national Cooperation (DGIS). An initial preparation report covering surface water and&#13;
TrounJdwater proposals (including water quality) was submnittt-d by Government in July 1993. and an&#13;
updated proposal for groundwater was issued in October 1993. A revised proposal for groundwater&#13;
related activities by CGWB aund the SGOs was issued in July 1994. The IMD prepared its proposal&#13;
in August 1994. Consultancy iniputs, financed by the Japanese General Trust Fund and the Dutch&#13;
andi Danish TruLst Funids, were available from Octobei' 1993 thlough September 1994 to provide for&#13;
technical review of the project proposals and to assist central and state agencies in finalizing the&#13;
project scope. Work programs for the first year of the project were reviewed during project&#13;
appraisal. Management and institutional arrangements were further reviewed subsequent to appraisal&#13;
by the Bank, DGIS and ODA in consultationi with Government, and adjustments to reflect this&#13;
review wvere also incorporated in the project design and its management features (Chapter V).&#13;
3.54  Implementation. The project implemeniting agencies are listed in Chapter 5 of this report,&#13;
described further in Annex 9 andl detailed' in the respective Annexes. An assurance was obtained&#13;
fronm GOI and the participating states that they would implement the project in accordance with&#13;
technical, finanicial, administrative, environmenital and hydrololgical practices, standards and criteria&#13;
satisfactor-y to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
3.55 The project investment program and implementation schedule are summarized in Annex l, Table&#13;
4 and shown schematically in Annex 9, Figure 1. The annual investment schedule shown underTable&#13;
4, Annex I would be subject to review during the annual project review process. Estimated&#13;
expenditures and physical investments are shown by state and agency in Annex 1, Table 3. and by&#13;
agency and component expressed as annual expenditures in Annex 2, Table 4. The estimated&#13;
expenditures for each project agency by items in physical and financial terms are given in Table 1 in&#13;
each of the Annexes 15 to 26. These estimates are likely to vary by agency depending on their&#13;
implementation progress and stage of achievement of their institutional development objectives. The&#13;
management process discussed in Chapter V provides the mechanism for steerage of the project and&#13;
attainment of its institutional and physical development targets. The annual implementation review&#13;
(para 5.22), and its supporting and preceding workshops and Institutional Development Reviews&#13;
allows the program planning process and implementation schedules for any agency to be updated and&#13;
adjusted annually to reflect institutional and technical development progress in the previous year and&#13;
adjustments to reflect the agencies water sector objectives and feed-back from state and central&#13;
authorities and water sector stakeholder. An assurance was obtained from GOI and the participating&#13;
states that they would: (i) undertake in collaboration with IDA, not later than October 31 of each year,&#13;
starting October 31, 1996, an annual review of the project, and shall incorporate the findings of such&#13;
review in work programs for the following year; and (ii) furnish to IDA for its review and comments,&#13;
not later than December 31 of each year, starting December 31, 1996, work programs, cost estimates,&#13;
and budget proposals for the project for the following fiscal year.  Assurances were also obtained&#13;
from GOI and the participating states that they would make budgetary provisions sufficient to&#13;
implement the agreed work programs for the fiscal year FY 1995/96 and each subsequent fiscal year&#13;
thereafter until project completion.&#13;
D. Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.56 By improving hydrological data necessary for sound water planning, allocation and management&#13;
which is responsive to the country's physical, economic and environmental needs, the project would&#13;
have strongly beneficial impact on the sustainability of water resources development including its&#13;
environmental management. The negative environmental impacts of the project would be minimal,&#13;
infrequent and temporary. The physical works are individually small and scattered, and do not cause&#13;
any permanent disturbance. The construction of water gauging stations, observation wells,&#13;
meteorological data collection sites, or buildings would constitute the maximum type of disturbance&#13;
envisaged under the proposed project. In most locations, there would be some flexibility in the siting&#13;
of physical infrastructure to accommodate local needs. On the other hand, the beneficial effects of&#13;
having a reliable and accessible scientific data for future planning and management of surface and&#13;
groundwater resources will be substantial and far outweigh any such small and temporary&#13;
disturbances. Of special importance, the proposed strengthening of the water quality data base and the&#13;
importance given to water pollution would provide substantial environmental and social benefits to a&#13;
large array of development and preservation/conservation issues which at present cannot be effectively&#13;
evaluated or managed because of the lack of reliable data.&#13;
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
4.01 Total project cost, including physical contingencies and expected price increases, is estimated at&#13;
US$ 162.4 million equivalent. The direct and indirect foreign exchange component is estimated at&#13;
about US$ 33.9 million, or about 21% of total costs. The cost estimates are based on July 1994 prices&#13;
and include local taxes and duties computed at about US$ 4.0 million. Cost estimates for works are&#13;
derived from costs of activities recently completed by CWC, CGWB and state agencies, updated to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
reflect price increases. Cost estimates for equipment, materials and vehicles are based on recent price&#13;
quotations from suppliers, or prices of similar goods recently purchased, or being procured bv various&#13;
government agencies. Consultant staff costs are based on experience with recent contracts for&#13;
foreignand local consultant services in India. Physical contingencies to allow for possible quantity and&#13;
design variations were applied at 10% of works, equipment and incremental operating costs, 5% for&#13;
training activities and zero for consultancies and R&amp;D activities. Price contingencies were applied to&#13;
the foreign exchange component at 1.5% in 1995, 1.8% in 1996, 2.6% in 1997 and 2.5% in 1998 and&#13;
thereafter. For local costs, price contingencies were applied at 9% in 1995, 8.5% in 1996, and 8% in&#13;
1997, 7% in 1998, and 6% in 1999 and thereafter. The cost estimates take into account the expected&#13;
changes in the currency equivalent over the project period. Project cost estimates are summarized in&#13;
Table 4.1 below and in Annex 1, Table 3 by States, agencies and components. The cost estimates are&#13;
further detailed in Annex 2 and given by item for each participating agencies in the respected annexes.&#13;

Project Financing&#13;
4.02 The proposed IDA Credit of US$ 142.0 million equivalent would finance about 90% of the total&#13;
project costs net of taxes, or about 88% of total costs including taxes. It would finance 100% of direct&#13;
and indirect foreign exchange costs and about 84% of the local currency costs. GOI would finance the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
remaining project costs of US$ 20.4 million from its development budget. The project financing plan&#13;
is summarized in Table 4.2 below.&#13;

Totals         128.5          33.9          162.4        100&#13;
In this respect, prior to negotiations, GOI obtained an approval for the project of the Expenditure&#13;
Finance Committee (EFC) of the Ministry of Finance, and each of the participating seven states&#13;
confirmed the financial clearance of their respective programs under the project. In addition, since this&#13;
is a project involving central agencies, GOI cabinet approval of the project would be obtained prior to&#13;
Board presentation.&#13;
Procurement (Annex 13b)&#13;
4.03 The procurement under the project would be undertaken by the implementing agencies at&#13;
national and provincial levels, as appropriate. To expedite procurement and promote the&#13;
standardization of specification, processes and procedures where possible, prior to negotiations, GOI&#13;
would cause CWC, CGWB and IMD to set up Project Procurement Committees satisfactory to IDA&#13;
as detailed in Appendix 1 of Annex 13b. An assurance would be sought from GOI that it would&#13;
maintain the Project Procurement Committees with terms of reference and membership agreed with&#13;
IDA.&#13;
4.04 The civil works (US$ 42.8 million), including construction of surface water observation&#13;
stations. climate observation sites, observation tubewells and buildings, would be widely dispersed&#13;
at many locations in the participating states. Works would therefore be procured by the concerned&#13;
central and state agencies under LCB contracts acceptable to IDA up to an aggregate of US$ 28.5&#13;
million and force account procedures acceptable to IDA would be used for contracts costing less than&#13;
US$ 20,000 each, up to an aggregate of US$ 14.3 million.&#13;
4.05 Instrumentation and ancillary equipment and laboratory equipment (US$ 21.8 million) would&#13;
be procured partly following ICB procedures (US$ 13.9 million), and where available and readily&#13;
serviced locally and in contracts of less than US$ 200,000 equivalent, following LCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA (US$ 4.7 million) and through local shopping procedures acceptable to IDA (US$&#13;
3.2 million). Computers, ancillaries and software and communication equipment (US$ 21.6 million)&#13;
would be procured partly following ICB procedures (US$ 17.0 million) and, where required, in&#13;
contracts less than US$ 200,000 equivalent following LCB procedures acceptable to IDA (US$ 3.1&#13;
million), with some propriety equipment and software directly purchased in accordance with&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA up to an aggregate of US$ 1.5 million. Specialized survey equipment.&#13;
office and training equipment and equipment of use in R&amp;D studies (US$ 5.1 million) would be&#13;
required by scattered project offices in the States over the six year project period. The procurement&#13;
would therefore be, either by LCB contracts let by the concerned agencies (US$ 2.2 million), or local&#13;
shopping procedures (US$ 2.9 million), acceptable to IDA. Vehicles (US$ 6.1 million) would be&#13;
required by each of the various implementing agencies and at various times during the life of the&#13;
project. The vehicles required for the first six months of the project (15% of total requirements)&#13;
would be procured by the concerned agencies following local shopping procedures in packages&#13;
below US$ 50,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate of US$ 0.9 million. Subsequent procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
would follow ICB procedures (US$ 2.5 million) and prudent shopping procedures acceptable to&#13;
IDA, depending on the contract size, up to an aggregate of US$ 2.7 million.&#13;
4.06 Incremental Operating Costs (US$ 49.5 million) and training activities (US$ 6.4 million)&#13;
would be provided using administrative procedures acceptable to IDA. Services related to research&#13;
and development (US$ 0.7 million) would be provided by the concerned agencies using&#13;
administrative procedures acceptable to IDA. Consultancv services (US$ 8.4 million) would be&#13;
procured under "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World&#13;
Bank as the Executing Agency".&#13;

4.08 Review of Contracts. All contracts for works or equipment estimated at US$ 200,000&#13;
equivalent and above would be subject to the Bank's prior review. The first five contracts, both for&#13;
works and goods, irrespective of value, would be subject to prior IDA review. Contracts of lesser&#13;
value than US$ 200,000 would be reviewed by IDA on a post-award sample basis. Invitation&#13;
documents, proposed awards and contracts for consultants' services valued at US$ 100,000 or&#13;
above for firms, or US$ 5.0(00 or above for individual consultants, would be reviewed by IDA.&#13;
This would result in about 50% of the project procurement being subject to prior review. The nature&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
of the project, consisting of simple works and standard equipment, is such that a higher level of IDA&#13;
review would not have a significant impact on procurement quality.&#13;
Credit Allocation and Disbursements&#13;
4.09 Implementation Period. Disbursements under the Credit are expected to be completed by&#13;
December 31, 2001. The disbursement profile for past investment projects in physical infrastructure&#13;
for water resources development in India has stretched over about eight years. However, the&#13;
proposed project constitutes a six-year investment program to improve the capabilities of&#13;
hydrological agencies to collect, store and disseminate data and infoination. These activities are not&#13;
expected to be susceptible to the delays experienced in completing large physical infrastructure&#13;
projects.  The schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 1, Table 5, and the detailed&#13;
implementation schedules of the project components indicate that this disbursement schedule is&#13;
feasible. The project completion date is September 30, 2001 and the closing date is March 31. 2(X)2.&#13;
4.1(0 Credit Allocation. The proposed allocation of the Credit and percentage of expenditures to be&#13;
financed are given in Annex 1, Table 6. Disbursements would be as follows: (a) 80% of&#13;
expenditures on works; (b) 100% of foreign expenditures (CIF) for directly imported equipment,&#13;
100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured equipment, or 80% of locally&#13;
procured goods; (c) 100% of expenditures for consultant services and training; and (d) for&#13;
incremental operating costs at 90% until March 31, 1999, 75% until March 31, 2000, and 50%&#13;
thereafter. With respect to item (d), almost all incremental operating costs until March 3 1, 1999&#13;
relate to project implementation; thereafter the incremental costs relate mainly to operating and&#13;
maintaining completed systems.&#13;
4. 1 1 Disbursements. Expenditures on contracts for works, goods and equipment valued at less&#13;
than US$ 200,000; for contracts for consultant firms and training services valued at less than US$&#13;
100,000; for individual consultant services valued at less than US$ 50,000; for works executed by&#13;
force account; and for incremental operating costs would be disbursed against Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursement for all other expenditures would be on the basis of full&#13;
documentation. Documentation for SOE expenditures would not be submitted to IDA for review, but&#13;
would be retained by the project implementation units and made available for inspection by IDA&#13;
supervision missions. Disbursements against SOEs are expected to amount to about US$ 80.0&#13;
million equivalent, or some 56% of the Credit amount.&#13;
4.12 Retroactive Financing. To expedite the project start-up, IDA would finance retroactively&#13;
project expenditures incurred after March 31, 1995 to the date of Credit signing, up to a limit of SDR&#13;
3.8 million (US$ 6.0 million equivalent), provided that procurement procedures acceptable to IDA&#13;
were followed. Expenditures in equipment, training and other preparatory activities and inci-mental&#13;
operating costs would be eligible.&#13;
4.13 Special Account. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account in US$ would be established&#13;
in the Reserve Bank of India with an initial deposit of US$ 6.0 million (equivalent to about four&#13;
months of project expenditures). It would be used for all eligible payments made against all&#13;
disbursement categories. A monthly statement on the Special Account would be submitted to the&#13;
Bank by the MOF.&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.14 For all Government agencies, each accounting section is headed by a qualified accountant who&#13;
reports monthly on budget and financial status. Therefore, the project would be subject to normal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
Government accounting and audit procedures. The accounting procedures now in place are adequate&#13;
to support SOE applications. Although annual audits are carried out in a timely manner, the&#13;
finalization is a lengthy process involving the presentation of the Statutory Audit Report to the&#13;
Legislature. Therefore, it would be essential to have an independent auditor prepare an interim&#13;
certification of the annual financial statements. Such statements certified by the responsible State&#13;
Accountant General or his designee, supported by an itemized account, a summary of the&#13;
expenditures, plus the auditor's opinion and comments would be submitted to IDA as soon as&#13;
possible, but within nine months after the end of each fiscal year. An assurance was obtained from&#13;
GOI and the participating states that they would cause each project executing agency to: (i) maintain&#13;
records and accounts adequate to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the&#13;
operations, resources and expenditures in respect of the Project; (ii) have the records and accounts&#13;
for each fiscal year audited, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied,&#13;
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; (iii) furnish to IDA, as soon as available, but in any case&#13;
not later than nine months after the end of such year, a certified copy of the report of such audit by&#13;
said auditors, or such scope and in such detail as IDA shall have reasonably requested; and (iv)&#13;
furnish to IDA such other information concerning said records, accounts and financial statements and&#13;
the audit thereof as IDA shall from time to time reasonably request.&#13;
4.15 An assurance was obtained from GOI and the participating states that they would cause each&#13;
project executing agency to: (i) keep all project related contract documents, documents related to the&#13;
SOEs, and orders and receipts for at least one year after IDA has received the audit report for the&#13;
fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the loan account was made; (ii) maintain the Special&#13;
Account, including records and documentation of receipts and withdrawals, as deemed satisfactory&#13;
by IDA; (iii) complete annual consolidated financial statements of the project for independent audit&#13;
within nine months of the close of each Government fiscal year; and (iv) undertake independent&#13;
audits of each year's consolidated project accounts, including the audits of SOEs and the Special&#13;
Account, and submit such audit reports to IDA within nine months of the close of each Government&#13;
fiscal year.&#13;
V. ORGANIZATION. MANAGEMENT and IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Process Approach&#13;
5.01 Given the complexity of institutional and management challenges, and the number of agencies&#13;
involved in the project, a flexible, responsive, approach would be appropriate.  Project&#13;
implementation and the interrelated strengthening of capabilities of each participating central and state&#13;
agency would be steered and managed through a "Process Approach"3. to project management. The&#13;
concept of the approach is that, while the general objectives and direction of the project are defined,&#13;
the specific work programs will need continuous monitoring, feedback from users and adaptations as&#13;
experience is gained. The project activities would be phased into manageable portions and a clear set&#13;
of objectives for each year in light of overall objectives would be defined. By allowing changes in&#13;
the project process after each annual review and in the design of annual plans, a flexible strategy is&#13;
envisaged, responsive to technical and institutional development objectives, and user feedback.&#13;
5.02 The "process-approach" would ensure that participating institutions are fully involved in the&#13;
preparation of institutional strengthening programs and related annual project work programs. The&#13;
approach would also ensure that staff of the agencies involved are encouraged to take responsibility&#13;
3     Elaboration of the project's organization and management features has been assisted by specialists&#13;
from DGIS (Netherlands) and ODA (UK).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
for attitudinal changes and improvements in the performance of their organizations. Full participation&#13;
of the staff will consequently contribute to the sustainability of the required institutional development.&#13;
5.03 The "process approach" is also characterized by built-in flexibility in project implementation&#13;
and by the ability to learn and adjust through experience gained, progress made, and feed-back from&#13;
users and stakeholder. Implementation of the project, including procurement and disbursement,&#13;
would be planned and organized for the forthcoming year based on outcome of the feed-back on the&#13;
past year's experience, and tailored to each participating agencies' stage of institutional development&#13;
and capability.&#13;
5.04 A flexible and process-oriented approach requires strong coordination of activities and&#13;
management of the project both at the Central and the State Government level. A strong steering&#13;
mechanism would be developed to enable the project to be well directed and controlled. The Annual&#13;
Project Review (APR) would provide an effective basis for an on-going dialogue between the Indian&#13;
authorities and the Bank about the physical and institutional progress made under the project and for&#13;
adjustments in the work program as required (para 5.21).&#13;
5.05 The main elements of project management are, in summary:&#13;
(a)   A "Hydrology Institutional Development Action Plan" (HIDAP) (para 5.15) would be&#13;
prepared by each institution involved. The IDAP would be monitored through an annual&#13;
"Hydrology Institutional Development Review" (HIDR) (para 5.16) focusing on the&#13;
management, organizational, and institutional development aspects of the project to be carried&#13;
out by each state and central agency.&#13;
(b)   Feedback on user orientation and satisfaction with hydrological information provision would&#13;
be obtained through establishment of Hydrology Data User Groups (HDUG) (para 5.17) at&#13;
central and state levels with representation of all agencies which have a legitimate interest in&#13;
the output of the project. The conveners of the HDUGs would organize annual&#13;
Hydrology Development Workshops (HDW) (para 5.18).&#13;
(c)  A National Coordination Committee (NCC) (para 5.10) would be maintained, including its&#13;
Secretariat which would be responsible for overall monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
(d)  A  State Project Coordinationi Committee (SPCC) would be maintained within each&#13;
participating state including a unit in each (para 5.11) responsible for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of the physical implementation and institutional development components of the&#13;
project.&#13;
(e)  Annual Project Reviews (APR) (para 5.21) would be carried out by each participating state&#13;
and central agency using the HIDR's, hydrology workshop findings, and project monitoring&#13;
information as key inputs. These key elements of the project management will be discussed&#13;
and further detailed during the Project Launch Mission (para 5.23).&#13;
B. Implementation and Management Arrangements&#13;
Project Agencies&#13;
5.06 The project would be implemented by the concerned existing central and participating state&#13;
agencies. Project implementing agencies are the: Central Water Commission (CWC), Central&#13;
Groundwater Board (CGWB), Central Water and Water Research Station (CPWRS), and National&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
Institute of Hydrology (NIH) within the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR); the India&#13;
Meteorological Department (IMD) within the Ministry of Science and Technology; and the&#13;
Governments of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP), Gujarat (GOG), Kerala (GOK), Madhya Pradesh&#13;
(GOMP), Maharashtra (GOM), Orissa (GOO), and Tamil Nadu (GOTN) through their agencies&#13;
responsible for surface water and groundwater hydrology. The existing and new organizational&#13;
arrangements of the participating agencies are described in Annex 9 and detailed in Annexes 15 to 26.&#13;
GOI and each participating state would provide staffing, facilities, services and the other resources&#13;
required to carry out the project in a manner satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
5.07 The work programs to be undertaken by each agency individually are clearly defined and&#13;
detailed in the respective annexes. In most respects, they are divided into activities in support of&#13;
surface water hydrology and groundwater hydrology respectively. This reflects the fact that the main&#13;
implementing agencies at the center--the CWC and CGWB--have mandates which define this&#13;
division, and most of the participating states have separate agencies responsible for surface water and&#13;
groundwater hydrology. The NIH would be responsible for some training activities and would be&#13;
available for some of the R&amp;D activities in the states (Annex 8). The CPWRS would provide advice,&#13;
training and research on instrumentation and could also be selected to undertake other project R&amp;D&#13;
activities. The IMD would be responsible for survey, investigation and design, supervision and&#13;
training for all aspects related to hydrometeorology.&#13;
5.08 Though the programs to be undertaken by each agency are individually defined, there is&#13;
spatial overlap between some activities to be undertaken by the CWC and the state surface water&#13;
agencies and between the programs of the CGWB and the SGOs. This applies particularly to the&#13;
upgrading and expansion of the stream flow measurement networks and the groundwater observation&#13;
networlks respectively. Coordinated planning will be required to define the spatial disposition of the&#13;
facilities to be installed by individual agencies in order to avoid duplication and unnecessary&#13;
expenditure. The CGWB Regional Office and the corresponding SGOs are well advanced in&#13;
developing joint programs.&#13;
Project Implementation Arrangements&#13;
5.09 In each state, several central agencies and normally two participating state agencies will be&#13;
involved in implementing the project, and similar and comnplementary programs will be implemented&#13;
by central and state agencies in the same area. It has therefore been necessary to establish&#13;
coordinating committees at central and state levels to ass;st in management of the project. The&#13;
committees will be responsible, at their respective levels tor: (a) monitoring and evaluating the project&#13;
progress and performance: (b) prepaiing consolidated annual progress reports for submission to the&#13;
Bank for review and comment; anid (c) collating anlual work programs developed by the project&#13;
coordiniating committees of the participating agencies to be discussed and agreed with the Bank at the&#13;
annual review of the project.&#13;
Project Coordination (Annex 9. Appendix I)&#13;
5. 1 () Central Coordination has been established. First, a National Level Steering Committee&#13;
(NLSC). chaired by the Secretary, MOWR. with representations at secretary levels of all&#13;
participating governments and central agencies has been formed in the MOWR. This Committee&#13;
would meet, as required, to resolve project policy and strategy and generic implementation issues.&#13;
Second, under the Steering Committee, a National Coordination Committee (NCC) has been set up,&#13;
chaired by the Member (RM). CWC. It would deal directly with the concerned central agencies&#13;
which are within its jurisdictioln--CWC,CGWB,CWPRS and NIH--in matters relating to project&#13;
coordination, and would act in an advisory capacity to the project coordinating committees at state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
level. The IMD would be represented on the NCC and parLtcipate in technical and project&#13;
management activities (para 3.40). The IMD would implement its program through its own&#13;
administrative chain of authority. The CWC, CGWB, IMD and NIH will for-m project coordinating&#13;
committees within their agencies to manage their own specific programs. Third, the MOWR has put&#13;
in place a Secretariat within the Ministry (under a Deputy Secretary) to assist the NCC in the&#13;
undertaking of day-to-day management of the project. The Secretariat and other participating&#13;
agencies would also be assisted by consultants (para 3.51).&#13;
5.11 Project Coordinating Committees at State Level. In states where the surface water and&#13;
groundwater hydrology entities are placed within the jurisdiction of a single department--Andhra&#13;
Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu--the State Project Coordination&#13;
Committees (SPCC) have been set up within, and report to, the Secretary of the controlling Irrigation&#13;
or Water Resources Department. In states where the surface water and groundwater hydrology&#13;
entities are controlled by separate departments--Maharashtra, and Orissa--the state will decide how to&#13;
create and where best to locate the coordination committee. An important function of the State&#13;
Project Coordination Committees will be liaison with the CWC authorities and CGWB regional&#13;
offices that are implementing project activities within their state jurisdictions, and with NIH. CWPRS&#13;
and IMD when their programs occur within state boundaries. An assurance was obtained from GOI&#13;
and each participating state that they would maintain project coordination arrangements in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
Organizational Framework&#13;
5. 12 The organizational and management challenges have been summarized in paras 2.05 to 2. 1 1.&#13;
One of the important project concepts is that responsibility for basic data collection on surface water&#13;
and groundwater resources, establishment of national and state level data bases, and dissemination of&#13;
this information to all legitimate user entities should, so far as is possible, be placed with agencies at&#13;
central and state levels which do not have direct responsibilities for developing water resources. The&#13;
IMD fulfills these requirements perfectly as a central agency responsible for hydrometeorological&#13;
information, and CWC and CGWB do not have direct physical development functions.&#13;
5.13  Major changes in organizational structures will not be necessary to achieve an acceptable level&#13;
of separation of responsibility for hydrological data collection, storage and dissemination, from the&#13;
other responsibilities of the water user agencies. The two agencies with data base creation functions&#13;
at the center--the CWC for surface water and CGWB for groundwater---are non-user agencies&#13;
reporting to the MOWR. The SGOs of the participating states have the required level of autonomy&#13;
within their parent agencies to peiform their tasks with regard to groundwater data without excessive&#13;
exposure to outside pressures and bias. Some important organizational changes have been agreed&#13;
with state surface water hydrology units to achieve the necessary levels of independence. Madhya&#13;
Pradesh has created a free-standing hydrology unit dealing with both groundwater and surface water&#13;
under an independent CE in its DOWR. The reorganization by Tamil Nadu of its PWD under the&#13;
Tamil Nadu Water Resources Consolidation Project to form a DOWR will result in a similar free-&#13;
standing unit under a CE with responsibility for surface water and groundwater hydrology. This&#13;
could be a model to follow in all states where groundwater and surface water evaluation entities are&#13;
within a single agency. The organizations that will be in place to implement the state programs are&#13;
discussed in the state Annexes 20-26.&#13;
5.14 Although changes in the overall organizational structure of the agencies involved will not be&#13;
necessary, there is substantial scope for institutional strengthening and development of their sub-&#13;
entities implementing the HP. In particular, institutional capability needs to be strengthened for the&#13;
collection, analysis and dissemination of data, inter-agency coordination to ensure a broad use of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
hydrological information, and the establishment of an effective working relation with stakeholder&#13;
and users.  Action plans will support the agencies involved in implementing the institutional&#13;
development in a structured and manageable way.&#13;
Hydrology Institutional Development Action Plan (HIDAP)&#13;
5. 15   An important element for sustainable and successful implementation and management of the&#13;
project will be the preparation of comprehensive action plans for each of the participating agencies.&#13;
An Institutional Development Action Plan (HIDAP) will be based on the assessment of the capacities,&#13;
potential and constraints of each agency with a view to identifying required resources, changes of&#13;
procedures, or technical assistance which could usefully be introduced with support of the project to&#13;
strengthen institutional capabilities. The IDAP should present in summarized tabular form, indicating&#13;
the problems identified, the corresponding objectives of the Hydrology Project, the measures to be&#13;
tak-en, the executing agencies concerned, an indicative timetable for the intended actions, the required&#13;
budget and need for technical assistance (i.e. training), and relevant performance indicators to&#13;
facilitate monitoring (in terms of outputs, key administrative steps or deadlines). The HIDAPs would&#13;
be submitted to the Project Coordinating Committees at central and state level for their scrutiny,&#13;
possible amendment and approval. Details of the HIDAP would be reviewed and agreed at the&#13;
Project Launch Mission.&#13;
Annual Hydrology Institutional Development Review (HIDR)&#13;
5.16. An annual Hydrology Institutional Development Review (HIDR) report would be prepared&#13;
based on results and recommendations of its preceding workshops and progress achieved in&#13;
implementation of IDAP separately by each central and state institutions involved in the&#13;
implementation of the Hydrology Project. The review would provide the mechanism for a specific&#13;
focus on the management, organizational and institutional development aspects of the project to be&#13;
used for the annual project review purposes (before October). Details of the purpose and mechanism&#13;
of HIDAP and the HIDR would be reviewed, further refined, and agreed during the Project Launch&#13;
Mission.&#13;
Linkages to Data Users&#13;
5.17 There are several central agencies that use hydrological and climatic data and that are not under&#13;
the jurisdiction of MOWR. Similarly, many state agencies, other than those controlling the surface&#13;
water and groundwater organizations, have use for the data produced. In addition, there are&#13;
important non-government organizations which would have use for the data produced. Although&#13;
these agencies will be not directly involved in project implementation, they should be used in an&#13;
advisory capacity. Moreover, as the users of project data, they have a direct interest in this basic&#13;
aspect of the project objectives. Thus, the MOWR and each of the participating states would set up a&#13;
Hydrology Data User Groups (HDUG), with representation of all the project implementing agencies&#13;
and any other agency which has a legitimate interest in the project's product (Annex 7, Appendix 1).&#13;
This forum would be used to discuss interests of agencies and other users outside the jurisdiction of&#13;
MOWR and IMD, and its main task would be to agree on arrangements by which the requirements of&#13;
such interests could be met effectively by the project. Similar consultation will be organized through&#13;
state level groups. In this respect, an assurance was obtained from the GOI and each participating&#13;
state that, not later than December 31, 1995, they would cause each project agency to set up and&#13;
thereafter maintain hydrology data user groups with membership and terms of reference agreed with&#13;
the Association.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
5.18 The conveners of the HDUGs will organize Annual Workshops to obtain feedback from users&#13;
on quality of service, type of demand, and satisfaction with existing arrangements. The Hydrology&#13;
Development Workshops (HDW) would be broad-based in representation, with particular focus on&#13;
stakeholder and users and including the private sector, NGOs and academics, as well as user&#13;
government agencies. Details of this workshop will be reviewed, further refined, and agreed during&#13;
the Project Launch Mission.&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
5.19 Monitoring in terms of both physical and institutional implementation, and system&#13;
performance will be carried out by each participating agency. The overall monitoring of project&#13;
perfromance will be undertaken by the project coordination secretariats at the center and at state&#13;
levels. The NCC will have responsibility for compiling information received from the concerned&#13;
central agencies and from the State project coordination committees in a form suitable for the annual&#13;
project review as well as management information useful to the implementing agencies. The Central&#13;
Project Coordination Secretariat would be manned with full time professional staff to design and&#13;
manage the monitoring systems, to guide and oversee the monitoring units at state level and prepare&#13;
the consolidated progress report for the annual project review. Consultants will assist in the project&#13;
mnonitoring activities.&#13;
5.20   Semi-annual progress reports would be prepared for each participating state and for the&#13;
central agencies involved in project implementations, collated by the NCC and submitted to the Bank&#13;
for review and comment. Each report would contain a brief description of the main events during the&#13;
reporting period and would cover progress on: (a) physical aspects, based on procurement and&#13;
construction plans; and (b) institutional aspects, based on the HIDAP mentioned above. In addition,&#13;
a Project Implementation Review (in standard Bank format) would be submitted by GOI to the Bank&#13;
no later than six months after project completion.&#13;
Annual Project Review&#13;
5.21 GOI and each participating state would carry out in collaboration with IDA, an annual review&#13;
of the project, not later than October 31 each year (para. 3.55), starting October 31, 1996. The&#13;
findings and recommendations of such review would be incorportated in the work programs of the&#13;
project agencies for the following fiscal year. The annual review arrangement would provide&#13;
flexibility to amend central and state agency programs to reflect performance during the previous&#13;
year. and to incorporate into the programs any lessons learned in the course of the previous year.&#13;
The National and State Project Coordination Committees would have responsibility for collecting and&#13;
collating the information presented foi review. The proposed work program for FY 1995/96 was&#13;
reviewed at appraisal and agreed at negotiations. The annual review process would be based on&#13;
information collated from: (a) the Institutional Development Review; (b) findings from the HDUG&#13;
workshops; and (c) results of routine project monitoring.&#13;
5.22 The annual review of the third year of the project period would also serve as the project's mid-&#13;
term review. Special attention would be given to recurring problems of implementation and to the&#13;
necessity of restructuring the project during mid-term as needed.&#13;
Project Launch Mission&#13;
5.23 A Project Launch/First Supervision mission including management and institutional as well as&#13;
technical specialists would be mounted within three months of Credit effectiveness to help the project&#13;
with appropriate technical, management and institutional orientation. Particular focus would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
placed on assisting the project entities to further elaborate its process management arrangements&#13;
described above and to review, revise as needed, and finalize consultant terms of reference.&#13;
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
Project Justification&#13;
6.01 Economic Justification. The project would generate substantial indirect benefits by improving&#13;
the water resources and climatic data base of the participating states, and making data easily available&#13;
to legitimate users from computerized data banks. The project objectives are directly supportive of&#13;
statements regarding water information systems in India's National Water Policy (paras. 1.23 and&#13;
2.12), the Bank's recent water resources management policy statement (para. 2.13), and the India&#13;
Irrigation Sector Review (para. 2.13). In fact, reliable water data, with adequate coverage in content,&#13;
time and space are the foundations on which all water resource planning, development and&#13;
management exercises must be based. Without substantial strengthening of the hydrological data&#13;
bases and making the data easily accessible to users, it is unlikely that the National Water Policy or&#13;
the Bank's Water Resources Policy can be successfully implemented in India.&#13;
6.02 Analytical Approach. Specific quantification of project benefits is not feasible because it is&#13;
not possible to estimate the value of India's existing hydrological data, or to quantify the marginal&#13;
benefit of any improvement to the hydrological data base resulting from project investments.&#13;
Consequently. a conventional marginal economic analysis cannot be made for the project. Instead, a&#13;
"risk assessment approach" has been adopted which calculates the value that a rational agent would&#13;
pay to acquire a data base to make a sound and realistic development decision I At the margin, the&#13;
premise tested is that an agent would be indifferent between the marginal value of more informnation&#13;
and the cost of acquiring it. The margin is taken as the estimated project costs in present value terms&#13;
and then testing what indirect benefits or savings. also in present value terms, could result from a&#13;
mor-e informed decision-making process and would be needed to pay for the project cost.&#13;
6.()3 Indirect Benefits. Project justificationi depends on identifying and quantifying marginal&#13;
returns in indirect benefits (or savings in indirect costs) that would justify implementing and&#13;
sustaining the improved data bases. In this respect, it is concluded that the economic and financial&#13;
impact of improved hydrological and hydrometeorological information can accrue in two classes of&#13;
decision making in the public or private sectors: (a) investment decisions in which water resources&#13;
availability is a dominant determinant (i.e., irrigated agriculture, water supply and sanitation,&#13;
industlial water use, etc.), and (b) operational decisions in existing enterprises in which water is an&#13;
essential input to achieve predicted impact.&#13;
6.04 To pay entirely f(1r the project. the investment decisions in the public sector need save only&#13;
0.6% of likely futuri-e investnmenlts in the sectors of irTigation, hydroelectricity power production,&#13;
infrastructure such as bridges, water supply and sanitation, and many other areas affecting by river&#13;
levels or flooding, etc. For example, the project costs would be paid for entirely through an annual&#13;
saving of only 1.3%  of the likely investment expenditures in irrigation, flood control and water&#13;
conservation which could be achieved by, inter alia. reducing overdesign costs in critical investments&#13;
in surface water structures such as dams, barrages. buunds. irrigation systems and command areas,&#13;
major water supply. etc. In this respect, there are numerous examples in India and elsewhere of&#13;
The project econonfic justilication is 1baLsed on Lhe following detailed assessment: "National&#13;
Hydrology ProJect, An Econmic Appraisal", by London Economics, Consultants, October 1994&#13;
(Commissioned by ODA, UK).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
discrete investments (many partly financed by multilateral and bilateral donors) that will not achieve&#13;
predicted impact because water requirements have been either overestimated at the design stages or&#13;
overcommitted due to subsequent development in the river basins concerned. Furthermore, without&#13;
sound hydrological information, the consequences of having to make 'best guess' decisions on&#13;
availability, allocation and use of finite water resources is likely to become more damaging to the&#13;
Indian economy as water becomes more scarce in many of the Indian river basins and the competition&#13;
between users increases.&#13;
6.05 The quantity and quality of water is a dominant determinant in enterprises generating some&#13;
22% of the Indian economy (predominantly in agriculture, food, fishing and hydroelectricity power&#13;
generation). If routine operational decisions in the public sector where water is a critical determinant&#13;
improved by only about 0.005% due to better quality of hydro-meteorological data, this would pay&#13;
entirely for the project. In fact, project costs would be paid for entirely through an increase of only&#13;
one sixth of one percent (0.016%) of extra agricultural production in the eight participating states&#13;
(which could be achieved through expansion of irrigated areas through water savings).&#13;
6.06 It is concluded that with very small improvements in the decision making processes related to&#13;
development of water resources and operation of existing development, the project investment to&#13;
improve and sustain hydrological data base is justified. The value of the extra and better data&#13;
obtained far outweighs the costs of the improved information base.&#13;
Risks&#13;
6.07 General and Institutional. A basic risk with a service project is that the service will not prove&#13;
as useful as expected. For this project, there is a risk that user agencies will not use the improved&#13;
hydrological and climatic data, even when it is readily available.  This risk will be naturally&#13;
contained and diminish over time by the increasing scarcity of water resources in India and the&#13;
growing competition between users for these scarce resources. This situation will put increasingly&#13;
strong premiums on state governments and users to reap the benefits from better and more thorough&#13;
analysis of water availability and water quality - which can only be done using an improved&#13;
hydrological and climate data base. In turn, GOI and donor agencies can be expected to increasingly&#13;
seek more resource information to evaluate development opportunities under conditions of increasing&#13;
resource scarcity. As indicated in paras 6.04 to 6.06, only very small improvements resulting from&#13;
improved water planning, allocation and management and investment decisions are required to justify&#13;
the investment under the Hydrology Project. Even substantial shortfall in the project's physical and&#13;
institutional development objectives would likely still yield substantial benefits from whatever&#13;
improvements in the hydrological system that are achieved. Nevertheless, maximum achievement&#13;
under the project is desirable and is aimed for. Accordingly, to maximize the possibility to yield as&#13;
fruitful an outcome as possible, and to help implement the project as near to its full potential as&#13;
possible and in a manner that will be sustainable after project completion, special management&#13;
features have been built into the project emphasizing a focus on progressive institutional&#13;
strengthening and continuous monitoring and feedback from stakeholder, and enabling adjustment of&#13;
the work programs of each agency in line with lessons learned and feedback from users and policy&#13;
makers. This is based on the "Process Approach" discussed at Chapter V, utilizing annual&#13;
workshops including stakeholder and policy makers, annual Institutional Development Reviews and&#13;
action plans feeding into preparation of each year's annual work program. This would be supported&#13;
by enhanced monitoring procedures and usage of development and impact indicators to provide focus&#13;
on the ultimate usage of the improved hydrological service. This approach is also supported by the&#13;
special inter-agency coordination arrangements provided for under the project, extensive consultancy&#13;
and training in both technical and management areas funded under the project, and by other&#13;
management features and arrangements discussed in Chapter V.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
6.08  The technical risks are relatively small. All the proposed technologies have been tested and&#13;
used outside India--and many within India--and proven effective. However, although the proposed&#13;
technologies are generally accepted, they may be novel to some of the agencies and thus their uptake&#13;
may proceed slower than anticipated. This risk is also contained in the process approach which&#13;
enables a (rigorously managed and evaluated) flexible project planning with adjustable annual work&#13;
programs for agencies decided at annual review process (para. 5.2 1 ). The project would also contain&#13;
technical risks by:  (a) screening through survey, investigation and detailed design; (b)&#13;
standardization of data collection, validation and storage; (c) attention to quality control and to&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of all aspects of project performance; and (d) ensuring that lessons learned&#13;
are shared with all concerned agencies as soon as possible.&#13;
6.09 The environmental risks associated with implementing the project are minimal. The overall&#13;
environmental impact of the project should be positive if the benefits of having reliable data for water&#13;
resources planning are taken into account.&#13;
VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
7.01 At negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOI and each of the participating states that&#13;
they would:&#13;
(a)    provide in a timely manner all the funds needed for O&amp;M of the project (para 3.49);&#13;
(b)    implement the project in accordance with technical, financial, administrative,&#13;
environmental and hydrological practices, standards, and criteria satisfactory to IDA&#13;
(para. 3.54);&#13;
(c)    (i) undertake in collaboration with IDA, not later than October 31 of each year,&#13;
starting October 31, 1996, an annual review of the project, and shall incorporate the&#13;
findings of such review in work programs for the following year; and (ii) furnish to&#13;
IDA for its review and comments, not later than December 31 of each year, starting&#13;
December 31, 1996, work programs, cost estimates, and budget proposals for the&#13;
project for the following fiscal year (para 3.55);&#13;
(d)    make budgetary provisions sufficient to implement the agreed work programs for the&#13;
fiscal year FY1995/96 and each subsequent fiscal year thereafter until project&#13;
completion (para 3.55);&#13;
(e)    callse each project executing agency to: (i) have project accounts, including Special&#13;
Account, maintained and audited annually in accordance with sound accounting and&#13;
auditing standards consistently applied by independent and qualified auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA; and (ii) submit to IDA, no later than nine months after the close of&#13;
each fiscal year, certified copies of the annual consolidated financial statements and&#13;
SOEs together with the auditor's report (paras 4.14 and 4.15);&#13;
(f)    maintain project coordination arrangements in a manner satisfactory to IDA&#13;
(para 5. 11); and&#13;
(g)    cause each project agency, not later than December 31, 1995, to set up, and thereafter&#13;
maintain, hydrology data user groups with membership and terms of reference agreed&#13;
with IDA (para 5.17).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
7.02 At negotiations, an assurance was also obtained from GOI that it would: employ consultant&#13;
services, not later than March 31, 1996 to assist with the implementation and supervision of the&#13;
project, under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA (para 3.51).&#13;
7.03 With the above assurances and understandings, the project would be suitable for an IDA credit&#13;
of SDR90. 1 million (US$ 142.0 million equivalent) on standard terms with a 35-year maturity.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Hydrology Project will assist the
            Government of India (GOI) and the seven participating states
            to develop comprehensive, easily accessed and user friendly
            data bases covering all aspects of the hydrological cycle,
            including surface water and groundwater in terms of quantity
            and quality and climatic measurements, particularly of
            rainfall. The project supports the objectives of GOI's
            national water policy and the Bank's strategy for
            India's water sector and policy regarding water
            resources management. Special attention will be paid to
            standardization of criteria, processes and procedures for
            measurement of hydrological parameters and for storage and
            retrieval of information so that data series will be
            compatible and the data bases will be interactive. The
            project will be structured as a six-year operation and
            include support of: upgrading and expanding the physical
            infrastructure for all aspects of the collection, collation,
            processing and dissemination of hydrological and
            hydrometeorological data; provision of equipment and
            materials; institutional strengthening including technical
            assistance and training; and new buildings and incremental
            operating and maintenance costs.
