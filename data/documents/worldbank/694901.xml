Project Objectives:    The proposed project establishes institutional and financial mechanisms&#13;
neededfor the long-term development of the housing sector. The goal is to&#13;
have housing production and financing carried out by private sector&#13;
developers and financial institutions. Lower-income households will benefit&#13;
from all project components.&#13;
Project Description:   The proposed project has three components:&#13;
a)  Institutional and Policy Development support through a program of&#13;
institutional capacity building to install and facilitate the development&#13;
of appropriate policies and institutional mechanisms for the housing&#13;
sector;&#13;
b)   Housing Finance, to establish the Secondary Mortgage Facility&#13;
(SMF), initially as a conduit for donor funds to commercial banks&#13;
making mortgage loans, to be developed at an early date as a market-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
driven intermediary, inter alia, through the recruitment of private&#13;
investors (IFC could become a shareholder when this transition is&#13;
complete) and a technical partnership with an existing similar&#13;
institution; a Mortgage Indemnity Fund (MIF); and a transparent and&#13;
well-targeted Housing Assistance Fund (HAF) to provide direct&#13;
assistance to lower-income buyers; and&#13;
c)   Housing Development, by introducing procedures and construction&#13;
finance, starting with a demonstration site, to encourage private&#13;
developers to produce lower-cost housing units.&#13;
Benefits and Risks:      The main benefit of the proposed project will be to put in place an&#13;
institutional and policy framework for the housing sector. During the initial&#13;
phase of the housing finance component, household borrowers will benefit&#13;
directly through the ability to access mortgage credit to purchase housing.&#13;
Lenders will benefit by the provision of long-term loans and through a&#13;
reduction in their liquidity risk. An increased flow of funds to housing may&#13;
increase employment in construction. Suppliers will also benefit from&#13;
increased certainty of demand. Although donor funds are the only resources&#13;
available to the SMF at the outset, technical work on both the SMF and the&#13;
regulatory environment for long-term savings during the project are&#13;
anticipated to lead to a subsequent conversion of the SMF to a full market-&#13;
driven refinance intermediary. Efforts are already underway to seek&#13;
investors for the SMF and to establish a technical partnership with a&#13;
successful similar institution in another country.&#13;
The project seeks to introduce policies and mechanisms which will&#13;
encourage a responsive flow of private resources to the housing sector and&#13;
the production of more, lower-cost dwellings. The risks associated with a&#13;
strategy based on voluntary participation by private entities are substantial.&#13;
They are: (a) those risks associated with developing and implementing&#13;
sound public sector policies and institutions, (b) the financial and business&#13;
risks inherent in the highly uncertain economy of the WBG, and (c) the&#13;
technical and institutional risks associated with project specific options.&#13;
Public policy and institutional development is necessarily the core of a&#13;
project whose objective is longer-term sustainable development of the&#13;
sector. The particular risk is that the consensus building and decision-&#13;
making required for successful implementation will take longer than&#13;
expected. The robustness of the project concept based on experience in many&#13;
countries and the lack of credible alternatives make this risk worth taking.&#13;
Similarly, the banks and developers may from time to time be reluctant to&#13;
play the expected role in the time-frame forecast. Anticipating changing&#13;
circumstances, the project has been designed with the flexibility to adjust the&#13;
incentives to private business. The technical and institutional risks of the&#13;
project design are largely related to unknown reaction of the market to the&#13;
proposed solutions. Again, the incremental nature of project outputs allows&#13;
for adjustment and mitigation of this risk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
Poverty Category:       The project is not a part of a core poverty program but will support Palestinian&#13;
efforts to alleviate poverty by creating lower-skilled jobs in urban areas where&#13;
poverty is most widespread.  Moreover, improvements to infrastructure&#13;
networks and services will also have a positive impact on surrounding&#13;
neighborhoods and city-wide reduction of health-problems associated with&#13;
poor sanitation services, which most often affect the poor.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return: Although it is not possible to estimate an IRR for this project, the initiation of&#13;
mortgage lending potentially creates substantial benefits. For lenders, the&#13;
SMF offers an opportunity to reduce the liquidity risk of mortgage lending.&#13;
For household borrowers, the availability of mortgage loans creates a benefit&#13;
equal to the substitution of lower cost debt for equity. For those without&#13;
adequate equity, it provides access to higher quality housing sooner.&#13;
Broader significant external benefits may be generated by the SMF as an&#13;
increase in the demand for housing spurred by mortgage lending, stimulates&#13;
the economy more widely.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1      With the signing of the Cairo agreement in April 1994, Gaza became relatively autonomous.&#13;
As a result of signing the Interim Agreement on September 28, 1995, similar autonomy has now been&#13;
extended to parts of the West Bank. These agreements open up new opportunities for Palestinian&#13;
development, but they also pose new challenges. Among the more important of the opportunities is the&#13;
chance to begin systematically addressing critical economic, social, institutional and infrastructure&#13;
problems. The challenge is to do so efficiently and equitably, and in a manner which best promotes long-&#13;
term economic and social development objectives.&#13;
1.2      The Economy. Using a "poverty line" of annual earnings of US$650 per capita, about half a&#13;
million people (one-fifth of the population) live in absolute poverty, on less than US$2 per day. This&#13;
includes approximately 40% of Gazans. Despite some recent easing the Palestinian economy is currently&#13;
under severe pressure. During the last months of 1995 and into early 1996, the economic situation had&#13;
begun to improve. A mini-boom in construction was in progress, particularly in Gaza. However, the&#13;
closure imposed on Gaza and West Bank beginning February 25, 1996, following a series of bombings in&#13;
Israel, has changed this picture dramatically. The IMF's latest projections' suggest a decline of GDP and&#13;
GNP of 4.6 and 6 percent respectively for 1996 as a whole, which translates into a loss of per capita&#13;
magnitude of about 7 and 10 percent respectively. A fiscal deficit of US$127 million is forecast&#13;
(compared with US$108 million for 1995). This scenario is based on two main assumptions: that&#13;
restrictions on merchandise trade with Israel will not be a factor in the latter part of the year, and that an&#13;
average of 25,000 workers in Israel will be employed in Israel from July 1 through December 1996&#13;
(currently 32,000 permits have been issued by Israeli authorities though actual employment still falls&#13;
short of this).&#13;
1.3      Employment. According to surveys conducted in October 1996, unemployment stood at 21%&#13;
with a further 12% of the workforce severely under-employed. These figures represent a modest&#13;
improvement from data collected six months earlier but unemployment is still very high. About 55,000&#13;
permits have been issued for Palestinians to work in Israel as of January 1997 although Palestinians&#13;
estimates suggest that due to the presence of guest workers in Israel, only about 45,000 Palestinians are&#13;
currently finding employment.&#13;
1.4      Demography. The West Bank and Gaza (WBG) comprises some 6,000 sq. km with a&#13;
population estimated at 2.5 million in 1994. This population has been growing at a rate of about 4&#13;
percent per annum. The West Bank and Gaza differ in demographics, infrastructure and economic&#13;
status. About 65 percent of the WBG population resides in the West Bank. More than 50 percent of the&#13;
combined populations are 15 years old or younger. High birth rates, relatively low mortality rates and&#13;
changing migration patterns are contributing to the rapid rise in population in both areas.&#13;
1.5      The West Bank population is widely dispersed among 422 small towns and villages. The&#13;
West Bank has only six larger urban centers and a population density of 267 persons per square&#13;
kilometer. The Gaza Strip, by contrast, has a density of 2,225 persons per square kilometer, with 16&#13;
larger cities (municipalities) and towns, and only a few small villages. Registered refugees represent 32&#13;
"Report on Fiscal Developments during the first half of 1996 and revised macroeconomics and fiscal projections for the second half of&#13;
1996", IMFIPA, June 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
percent of the West Bank population, of which only one-quarter live in refugee camps. In Gaza, 72&#13;
percent of the population are registered refugees, of which about 55 percent live in camps. GNP per&#13;
capita is significantly lower in Gaza than in the West Bank. Gaza was previously administered by Egypt,&#13;
while the West Bank was an integral part of Jordan. As a result there are differences in legal regimes,&#13;
land tenure and transfer procedures, service provision, and even housing types and preferences.&#13;
1.6      The Housing Sector. In the past twenty-five years the construction of new housing has been&#13;
severely constrained both by formal restrictions on land and housing development and by low and&#13;
uncertain incomes. Strong restrictions were imposed on the transfer of funds into WBG and on the&#13;
establishment and development of local banking and credit institutions. Housing construction during&#13;
occupation did not keep pace with needs. Even those with resources faced administrative and legal&#13;
difficulties in buying or building better housing.&#13;
1.7      As a result, Palestinian housing, particularly in the Gaza strip, is characterized by high&#13;
occupancy densities, poorly functioning land markets and deficient infrastructure. It is estimated that&#13;
around one-third of all Palestinian households live in situations where there are more than 3 persons per&#13;
room, and that almost 10 percent live with more than 5 persons per room. About one-quarter of all&#13;
households have no running water, one fifth have no electricity and over one third have no sanitation&#13;
facilities. Unlike other countries with housing shortages or populations unable to afford housing,&#13;
Palestinian families do not usually opt for informal housing such as squatting on public land, renting in&#13;
slums, etc. Rather, the norm is to expand nuclear households, creating highly crowded conditions.&#13;
Another problem is the lack of investment in infrastructure and services such as schools, transport, and&#13;
maintenance to serve existing communities and areas of cities which are expanding with new house&#13;
construction.&#13;
1.8      Until the start of the peace process, the political, economic and institutional constraints&#13;
affecting the West Bank and Gaza precluded formulating a housing policy or strategy. Palestinian&#13;
authority over key aspects of the housing sector, such as land markets, regulation, finance, etc. did not&#13;
exist. Palestinian institutions responsible for the planning, implementation and management of the&#13;
housing sector are newly established. Their capacities are limited and their policies, regulations, norms&#13;
and processes are nascent. The Ministry of Housing, established in 1994, has identified the priorities and&#13;
elements of a housing strategy and policy which are communicated to the Bank in a letter of policy&#13;
development attached as Annex 1. However, much needs to be done to put the institutions, policies and&#13;
financing in place so that the housing sector can begin to operate and make progress.&#13;
1.9      Since the signing of the Declaration of Principles in 1993 there has been somewhat of a boom&#13;
in residential construction, especially in Gaza. Although precise data are not available, the total value of&#13;
new residential construction may be as high as 13.4% of GDP in recent years2 and the total number of&#13;
new units built in Gaza may be as high as 2,000 per year in 1994 and 1995. This represents a&#13;
considerable increase over previous periods and reflects in part the uncertainty concerning other&#13;
investments and business opportunities. The characteristic of much of the new housing is cash-financed,&#13;
multi-family structures often built in anticipation of demand from returning Palestinians. As a result new&#13;
units are typically large with high standards and selling prices from US$40,000 to over US$100,000.&#13;
Most observers of the real estate industry believe this phenomenon to have run its course and that&#13;
broader stable demand with term financing will be necessary for a healthy housing industry.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
A.    Housing Sector Issues and Strategy&#13;
1.10       The main housing sector issues fall into four categories:&#13;
a. the role and structure of the public sector in policy formulation and implementation;&#13;
b. the high price of housing; the absence of a well-functioning land market; and the limited&#13;
housing choices available to lower-income households;&#13;
c. the absence of forrmal financing for the construction or purchase of housing; and&#13;
d. the need for mechanisms to assist the poor to improve their access to housing.&#13;
1.11       Although the need for more and lower cost housing is large and obvious in the West Bank&#13;
and Gaza, there is considerable uncertainty as to how and when that will be translated into effective&#13;
demand. The major unknowns are the number and timing of returnees, the disposition of those now&#13;
living in refugee camps and the general stabilization and growth in incomes for all Palestinians.&#13;
Although internal migration may not be a significant factor in the housing market given the small&#13;
geographical area and many established settlements, the demographic pressures both from high birth&#13;
rates and delayed family formation will continue to stress the housing sector.  The deteriorated&#13;
conditions of many units may also lead to considerable repair and expansion of existing units as is&#13;
already visible in many areas of the WBG.&#13;
1.12       Given the widely varied estimates of the demand for housing, the strategy must necessarily&#13;
concentrate on creating strong and flexible public and private institutions rather than on planning for a&#13;
specific output target. In particular, the capacity to finance the sector must be augmented. A well-&#13;
functioning housing sector will require, in addition to the creation of new institutions, an intensive&#13;
upgrading of the administrative, managerial and technical capabilities of the local authorities in order to&#13;
increase their capacity to plan, implement and administer infrastructure extensions and improvements.&#13;
1.13       World Bank Strategy. Since 1993, the Bank Group has been actively involved in a broad-&#13;
based donor effort to assist the WBG. Apart from lending $150 million for 7 projects to date from IBRD&#13;
profits and net income through the TFGWB, the World Bank has received well over $500 million in&#13;
cofinancing pledges or trust fund commitments from other donors. The World Bank's strategy for WBG&#13;
as outlined in the Board paper "Replenishing the Trust Fund for the West Bank and Gaza'" (R96-25 1)&#13;
focuses on three priority areas: (a) restoring and further developing basic and social infrastructUre: (b)&#13;
building policy-making and institutional capabilities; and (c) supporting the emergence of the private&#13;
sector. This project is consistent with these strategic objectives.&#13;
1.14       The past year has demonstrated the need for a flexible strategy so that if events require it, the&#13;
Bank can expand the emergency components of its program. However, the primary goal remains the&#13;
establishment of a basis for sustained growth in the medium term. In line with the above strategy&#13;
objectives, the current fiscal year's program and the pipeline of projects for future years focuses on&#13;
developing infrastructure, capacity building and private sector development. In addition to the efforts&#13;
already made to-date by the Bank to provide for an enabling environment for private sector development,&#13;
a significant portion of the US$90 million replenishment of the TFGWB approved in February of this&#13;
year by the Board of Governors will fund initiatives to further promote the environment necessary for&#13;
private sector development and developing basic physical and social infrastructure in WBG.&#13;
1.15       The Palestinian Authority's Public Investment Programs (PIP)3 which included about&#13;
US$780 million in physical infrastructure for the 1995-98 period reaffirmed the centrality of basic&#13;

physical and social infrastructure rehabilitation, but pointed to the urgent need to rationalize service&#13;
delivery; establish the policy and institutional arrangements for greater private sector participation; and&#13;
reduce dependence on external funds to finance recurrent costs.4 The Bank supported this program with&#13;
a set of five key infrastructure projects: Municipal Infrastructure Development (FY96); Water and&#13;
Sanitation Services (FY97, focused on Gaza only); Housing Project (FY97-this project); Industrial&#13;
Estates (FY98); and Electricity Sector Investment and Management (FY98). The first two of these&#13;
projects are already under implementation; together with a second Emergency Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(ERP II), they have been funded through a US$90 million replenishment of the TFGWB in 1995. A&#13;
second US$90 million replenishment was approved by the Governors in February 1997, and the Housing&#13;
Project will be financed out of these proceeds.&#13;
1.16      The severity of the economic crisis which began in late February 1996 also required an&#13;
immediate emergency response. This was necessary to relieve unemployment, minimize social hardship,&#13;
and avoid permanent damage to the peace process. In response to the crisis, an emergency employment&#13;
generation program was developed which created some 15,000 to 20,000-full-time equivalentjobs. This&#13;
program has been financed through the Holst Fund and more recently by ERP II.&#13;
1.17      The Bank has had a continuing relationship with the authorities on housing sector issues.&#13;
The study, Developing the Occupied Territories: An Investment in Peace, includes a chapter on housing.&#13;
Bank staff and consultants have led the substantive work on these issues funded by the Technical&#13;
Assistance Trust Fund (TATF). The assistance provided on housing finance issues directly underpins the&#13;
present proposals and the policy development work provided the enabling framework adopted by the&#13;
MOH. This leadership and experience should be an advantage in mobilizing donor financing for this&#13;
project and for the housing sector. The proposed project is central to situating and linking housing sector&#13;
policy to key aspects of economic management. The role of the public sector must be consistent with the&#13;
fiscal realities for the economy. The development of a competitive market-based housing finance system&#13;
can strengthen and accelerate the development of the financial sector rather than introduce unmanageable&#13;
risk as often occurs. Bank leadership on housing issues can facilitate these objectives.&#13;
2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.1      Sector and Project Strategy. The present cash-financed production of new housing targeted&#13;
to wealthy returning Palestinians is not a good long-term basis for a stable and healthy housing sector. A&#13;
sustainable level of investment with less volatility will materialize if the considerable existing capacity&#13;
and vigorous output of the private sector is able to shift some production to the construction of lower-&#13;
cost products and if households wanting to purchase are able to obtain long-term financing. Since&#13;
increasing the purchasing power of low- and moderate-income households is essential to stimulating the&#13;
private production of lower-cost housing, some carefully considered incentives are necessary to start this&#13;
process. The initial phase of the housing finance initiative provides the mechanisms and incentives for&#13;
formal financing to begin to flow to the housing sector.&#13;
2.2      In order to define and launch a Palestinian housing policy, the proposed project seeks to&#13;
demonstrate that appropriate, lower-cost housing options can be achieved and that financing can be made&#13;
available on a sustainable basis. The PA has made known its policy toward housing in a number of&#13;
official documents including a recent communication from the Minister on sector policy and a previous&#13;
letter to the Bank concerning financing issues, both available in Annex I and other documents listed in&#13;
Annex 15. At the same time this project initiates a process of policy development and institutional&#13;
strengthening which is urgently needed to sustain the housing sector in the longer-term. This project is&#13;
41 To date these costs have been supported by the Bank Group managed Hoist Fund, a component of EAP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
part of a larger strategy to address different aspects of the housing problem in the WBG. The target&#13;
beneficiaries for new housing construction and support under this project are the households who can&#13;
reasonably be expected to save for downpayments and make payments on mortgage loans. This group&#13;
can also include some households whose income is somewhat below that level that are provided with&#13;
appropriate but modest assistance. The housing conditions of even lower-income families will be&#13;
improved through a program of upgrading infrastructure in lower-income neighborhoods supported&#13;
under the Municipal Infrastructure Development Project, FY96 (Project No. 43339, Report No. 15400-&#13;
WBGZ).&#13;
2.3      The PA requested that the World Bank Group, donors and commercial banks finance 10,000&#13;
dwelling units. However, the financial requirements and implementation capacity are currently not&#13;
available. Therefore, the PA and the Bank have agreed to proceed with a Housing Project funded, in&#13;
part, by the Bank that over a four-year period will put in place a sustainable system to produce lower-&#13;
cost housing. To do so the proposed Project is phased to a) establish the institutional and policy&#13;
environment for the sector, b) install and build the financial mechanisms for starting mortgage lending&#13;
by commercial banks and assistance for lower-income households, and c) develop an initial&#13;
Demonstration Site of 1,000 housing units, with a goal of developing an additional 3,000 dwelling units.&#13;
2.4      In the absence of established policies, norms, financial instruments, and institutions, the&#13;
proposed project provides donors, local institutions, and private developers a strategic framework for: a)&#13;
a quick response to the needs of lower-income households; and b) installing the foundations for building&#13;
and guiding the housing sector. The physical investment components aim at quickly producing needed&#13;
housing and supporting urban infrastructure, while demonstrating that the production of appropriate&#13;
standard, lower-cost housing by private developers is viable. The financing initiative provides the&#13;
mechanisms and incentives for formal financing to begin to flow to the housing sector. The MOH will&#13;
be the coordinating and executing agency for the project, with implementation largely in the hands of&#13;
private sector developers, financial institutions and local authorities.&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
2.5      The project helps launch and support a long-term  strategy and program  of financial,&#13;
investment, institutional and policy development. These actions are intended to remove specific&#13;
bottlenecks in the housing sector in order to improve the functioning of the housing market, particularly&#13;
for lower- to moderate-income households. A fundamental goal of the project is to put into place a&#13;
financial system for mortgage lending through the existing commercial banks. Complementary actions&#13;
include encouraging land development and construction of new lower-cost housing by private&#13;
developers, providing infrastructure related to the development of new housing, and strengthening sector&#13;
policies and institutions.&#13;
2.6      The project improves access to shelter for lower-income groups by encouraging the&#13;
construction and acquisition of appropriately designed plots of land, basic dwelling units and apartments&#13;
based on the response of private supply to effective market demand. A structured schedule of policy&#13;
formulation and institutional capacity building will help establish a firmer institutional base and provide the&#13;
much needed regulatory and enabling environment for the effective evolution of the housing sector.&#13;
2.7      Because the project is to support the PA's first steps towards the development of the housing&#13;
sector (including policies, programs, financing, production, and markets), the specific objectives of the&#13;
project are to:&#13;
a. put in place institutions, policies and actions necessary to build and sustain a well-&#13;
functioning housing sector;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
b. make housing more affordable by initiating the development of a competitive, market-&#13;
based mortgage system, accompanied by well-targeted assistance to lower-income&#13;
households;&#13;
c. reduce house prices for lower-income households by (i) reducing obstacles to the&#13;
availability of land; (ii) promoting a competitive development process for lower-cost&#13;
alternatives; and (iii) providing assistance for the capital costs of infrastructure.&#13;
B.    Project Components&#13;
2.8      The three project components are presented below and detailed in Annexes 4 to 8:&#13;
A. Institutional and Policy Development Component to facilitate the development of&#13;
appropriate policies and build an institutional capacity to guide the sector. The component&#13;
will fund a four-year program of policy and institutional building measures and equipment&#13;
which will promote the formulation of key physical planning and regulatory instruments,&#13;
permit the analysis and preparation of policy options, and provide a sequence of capacity-&#13;
building measures to help the newly forming public and private institutions involved in the&#13;
housing sector.&#13;
B. Housing Finance Component to activate commercial mortgage lending to WBG&#13;
households by assisting commercial banks manage the risks of entering this new business.&#13;
The component will also initiate the establishment of regulatory and institutional mechanisms&#13;
to support a sustainable system of mortgage lending, including:&#13;
(i) A Secondary Mortgage Facility (SMF), to provide liquidity and help lenders manage&#13;
term intermediation risks by refinancing their long-term mortgage loans, initially with&#13;
TFGWB funding. The SMF has been established as a private shareholding company.&#13;
Founding shareholders are the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Monetary&#13;
Authority with board representation also from the housing sector. Commercial banks&#13;
have been invited to become shareholders in the SMF and, together with an experienced&#13;
technical partner, build the SMF as a commercially viable entity. The IFC is prepared to&#13;
join as an investor in the capital of the SMF if the transition to sustainable commercial&#13;
operations can be achieved in a reasonable time.&#13;
(ii) A Mortgage Indemnity Fund (MIF), to share credit risk with mortgage lenders in&#13;
WBG. The MIF has been established as a fund initially to be administered by the SMF.&#13;
Funding for this risk-sharing facility will come from a reserve created from the&#13;
concessionality of funding provided to the SMF.&#13;
(iii) A Housing Assistance Fund (HAF) (Funding for this component will be entirely&#13;
borne by the PA), to provide direct assistance to lower-income home buyers. The HAF&#13;
will provide subsidies to qualified lower-income households to improve their ability to&#13;
purchase a dwelling unit. The assistance will help make-up the downpayment for&#13;
modest-cost housing and 'o lower the loan repayment burden.&#13;
C. Housing Development Component to help the MOH put in place a mechanism to&#13;
encourage the production of lower-cost housing by private developers. The MOH/private&#13;
developer partnership is expected to produce dwelling units estimated to sell for an average of&#13;
US$25,000 to US$30,000 each, on either: (i) tracts of state land provided with off-site&#13;
infrastructure on which private developers will bid for the production of qualifying housing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
units; and/or (ii) qualifying private lands on which private developers propose and produce&#13;
qualifying dwellings. In both cases qualifying dwelling units can be either single-family&#13;
houses or low-rise condominium or cooperative apartment units meeting price ceilings and&#13;
minimum specifications. This component will help finance:&#13;
(i)   the off-site infrastructure and basic community facilities, initially to a&#13;
Demonstration Site and to additional sites, as needed in Gaza and West Bank&#13;
cities, to service tracts of land on which private developers will build and market&#13;
eligible units;&#13;
(ii)   a Demonstration Site on state-owned land in Gaza City (Tal El-Hawa) for 1,000&#13;
units, including infrastructure and facilities, on which developers will design,&#13;
build and market units; and,&#13;
(iii) Construction Finance for developers.&#13;
C.    Project Description&#13;
2.9      The proposed project establishes and helps build the institutional and financial mechanisms&#13;
needed for the long-term development of the housing sector. The project will help the MOH implement&#13;
its policy of having lower-income housing production largely in the hands of private sector developers&#13;
and financial institutions.&#13;
2.10      The Institutional and Policy Development Component. The PA's strategy for improving&#13;
housing conditions in WBG is to have the public sector adopt an enabling role, while the private sector&#13;
undertakes the production and financing of housing. The private sector has already demonstrated the&#13;
engineering and financial capacity to undertake large-scale housing development in the WBG, albeit&#13;
targeted to the upper-income levels. Commercial banks have considerable liquidity in the form of short-&#13;
term deposits collected in WBG. They are ready to provide initial lending for housing with the support&#13;
features included in this project. The public sector institutions, however, are newly established. Housing&#13;
policy is largely the responsibility of the MOH, which is developing and implementing the regulatory&#13;
regime necessary for a competitive market-oriented housing system. Under the project, a program of&#13;
institutional strengthening will be provided to relevant MOH and financial institutions and their service&#13;
units on: (a) sector planning and regulatory instruments; (b) physical development standards; (c)&#13;
monitoring and supervision of ongoing projects; (d) procurement planning and contracting (civil works&#13;
and equipment); (e) training; (f) specialized information and data systems; and (g) coordination and&#13;
administration of capacity building activities. These capacity building measures will be funded by the&#13;
project in the form of a structured four-year program to develop policies and norms, and to build the&#13;
capacity of the financial institutions and the MOH. At negotiations understanding was reached on the&#13;
program's scope and structure. The first part of the plan will consist of a consultative needs assessment&#13;
to be carried out as part of the project launch and which will lead to the preparation of a Program&#13;
Implementation Plan, which will be acceptable to IDA, and finalized no later than July 1, 1997 (para.&#13;
7.1). The component includes support for: studies to help introduce institutional reform (staffing,&#13;
organizational and operational recommendations) proposals; studies and workshops to formulate and&#13;
deliberate sector policy; on-the-job staff training and specialized training courses; development standards&#13;
formulation and implementation workshops; advisory services and contracts for developing sector data&#13;
base information; and providing the MOH with equipment and vehicles needed for maintaining data&#13;
systems and for implementing the project. Annex 8 describes the program and its elements in greater&#13;
detail.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.11      Activating Commercial Mortgage Lending. In order to stimulate and encourage the&#13;
provision of affordable housing to all employed households and encourage financial sector development&#13;
in WBG, the project seeks to create a sound and sustainable financial system that features an effective set&#13;
of institutional mechanisms for providing housing finance. At the core of such a system is the provision&#13;
of credit by private financial institutions to qualified borrowers. The project envisions the creation of&#13;
specialized institutions to reallocate a portion of mortgage risk and enhance the affordability of housing.&#13;
2.12      The project helps establish the Palestinian Secondary Mortgage Facilitv SMF as a private&#13;
shareholding company with the purpose of providing long-term finance to banks to reduce the liquidity&#13;
risk incurred in mortgage lending. A fund to share credit risk with banks making mortgage loans within&#13;
WBG, termed the Mortgage Indemnity Fund MIF has also been established. Both the provision of long&#13;
term loans to banks and the sharing of credit risk will facilitate the introduction of mortgage lending in&#13;
an uncertain economic, legal and regulatory environment. The activities of the SMF and the MIF will&#13;
increase the flow of funds to housing and improve the affordability of housing finance in WBG. In&#13;
addition, as the SMF moves to raising funds through the issuance of bonds it may contribute to the&#13;
development of the local capital market.&#13;
2.13      The SMF was registered as a company on March 10, 1997 (Registration # 563122563) with&#13;
authorized capital of $6 million of which $2 million has been subscribed equally by the PA and the&#13;
PMA. Private financial institutions have been invited to invest in the SMF and are expected to do so in&#13;
the near future. The institutional structure within which the SMF will operate is shown below. It will&#13;
raise funds initially through long-term loans from donors made to the PA who will make these funds&#13;
available to the SMF for on-lending to qualified' banks in W"G. The terms of the on-lending agreement&#13;
between the banks and the SMF will include the definition of qualified mortgage loans, standards for&#13;
bank documentation, loan terms, reporting and underwriting, and the extent of bank provision of&#13;
mortgage loans from own funds. The SMF will earn a spread between its funding and loan rates. A&#13;
small portion will be used to cover its administrative costs but most of this spread will be transferred to&#13;
MIF to be used to share future default losses of the banks.&#13;
2.14      The MIF is structured as a fund to share default loses on mortgage. The formula for sharing&#13;
loses is based on an advanced agreement on the division of loses, most likely on a pari passu basis.&#13;
Total claims on the MIF are limited by the transfer of funds from the SMF which will grow with SMF&#13;
operations. In exchange for MIF risk sharing, the originating banks will be restricted either by borrower&#13;
income or house price in order to encourage banks to move down market as they introduce mortgage&#13;
lending.&#13;
2.15      The SMF's activities will be complemented by a Housing Assistance Fund (RAF), described&#13;
below, that will provide up-front grants to qualified households to assist in meeting downpayment&#13;
requirements.&#13;
s The SMF Operational Guidelines will define a qualifying bank.&#13;

2.16       The proposed Palestinian Housing Assistance Fund (HAF) will provide targeted assistance&#13;
to lower- and moderate-income households for the purchase of a primary residence. Separating HAF&#13;
from the remaining project components is essential in order to separate subsidies (a fiscal issue) from&#13;
lending (a banking issue). Beyond the scope of this initiative, the MOH intends to develop HAF as the&#13;
institution that permnanently assumes responsibility for the personal assistance programs in Palestinian&#13;
housing policy.&#13;
2.17       Families belonging to the income stratum eligible for HAF6 assistance will utilize savings&#13;
and bank loans in conjunction with assistance grants to purchase housing in the US$20,000 to&#13;
US$30,000 price range. By providing a strong incentive for saving, the fund can reduce the credit risk of&#13;
bank mortgage lending, both through increasing the downpayment for residence purchase and by&#13;
providing banks with a positive signal about the financial capabilities and discipline of households.&#13;
Table I displays the envisaged financing solution for the median recipient:&#13;

2.18       The amount of assistance will be based on need, with those at the lower end of the targeted&#13;
income range receiving the largest amount of assistance. Nevertheless, a cap is proposed in order to&#13;
minimize distortions to work incentives and to stretch funds, implying a higher effort for households&#13;
with less income. A major issue in providing housing assistance payments to residents of WBG is&#13;
equitability. As long as fully need-driven programs are unaffordable for the PA, eligibility criteria will&#13;
have to be formulated in a way that minimizes the potential for administrative arbitrariness. Parameters&#13;
will include income, a no-homeownership condition, the requirement of a financing and savings plan,&#13;
61  The envisaged stratum includes families with monthly standardized income under US$600. Standardization is a method for making the&#13;
incomes of families of different size and age structure comparable. All affordability calculations are based on the standardized income&#13;
concept.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
and a maximum wealth limit. The strategy is to minimize public expectations, and gradually step up the&#13;
program as more resources become available.&#13;
2.19      The HAF will obtain its initial resources in the form of public land (estimated to be worth&#13;
US$5 million) for the construction of lower-cost housing. In the future, donor resources and eventually&#13;
budgetary resources will be necessary to sustain the operation of the HAF. The public land will be&#13;
included as a cost in housing production and any discount given to eligible price of the buyers will be&#13;
deemed a HAF subsidy.&#13;
2.20      The HAF will be a separate government entity under the supervision of the Ministry of&#13;
Housing. Since the initial resources are limited to public land the program can be administered with a&#13;
small staff within the Ministry. In the longer term the organizational design of the HAF will based on&#13;
the idea of task-sharing with other public entities and participating banks.&#13;
2.21      The Housing Development Component will help the MOH stimulate private developers to&#13;
produce appropriate lower-cost housing units. The key instrument for this is the Developers 'Prospectus,&#13;
(detailed in Annex 5), the model of which was agreed to at negotiations (para. 7.1). The Prospectus&#13;
helps developers identify and make housing proposals that qualify for participation in the project. It&#13;
details how developers are to participate, how proposals are evaluated and how marketing of the new&#13;
housing units relates to the financing and assistance programs. The Prospectus specifies development&#13;
norms/standards, and land clearance/review/approval procedures that must be followed by the MOH and&#13;
the developer.  Using the Prospectus, developers design, produce and market qualifying units.&#13;
Prospective buyers will apply for mortgages from commercial banks and/or assistance from the HAF, to&#13;
help finance the purchase of units produced.&#13;
2.22      In order to quickly put in place and test the procedures, as well as to show developers,&#13;
buyers, and financial institutions the type of products, a 55 dunum (550 ha.) Demonstration Site of state-&#13;
owned land called Tal El-Hawa in Gaza City will be developed. Off-site and on-site infrastructure and&#13;
basic community facilities for about 1,000 demonstration apartment units will be built, and developers&#13;
will competitively bid for developing units that meet the specifications of the agreed Developers'&#13;
Prospectus for the Tal El-Hawa Demonstration Site. Issuing the invitation to bid will be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness (para. 7.2). The infrastructure and site development plan for the Tal El-Hawa site will be&#13;
subject to IDA approval, and will be a condition of disbursement of the civil works category (para. 7.2).&#13;
Developers' construction financing will be available through the MOH (with commercial banks as&#13;
agents) to help developers enter the program quickly. These construction loans will be short-term and not&#13;
to exceed 50% of the estimated cost exclusive of the price of land (para. 7. 1).&#13;
2.23      The number and location of units that could be produced is dictated by the market and&#13;
proposals of private developers. The four-year project period provides the lead time needed for&#13;
establishing procedures and instruments and a learning period for the agencies and private developers in&#13;
applying these. Another factor determining the number of units developed is the availability of land for&#13;
lower-cost housing. State-owned land, of which the Demonstration Site is the first assigned to the&#13;
project, while limited is available (Annex 4a) in Gaza and West Bank cities. The MOH proposes to also&#13;
use land adjacent to the Demonstration Site for its Housing Cooperatives program.  About 2000&#13;
apartment units are to be developed by cooperative members. The Tal El-Hawa site can accommodate&#13;
over 3,000 apartment units. The Tal El-Hawa site (described in detail in Annex 4a) has been subject to&#13;
the required environmental and antiquities surveys, and necessary clearances have been obtained (para.&#13;
5.3). Many smaller, privately owned plots of land suitable for this type of development are expected to&#13;
be proposed by developers. Based on estimated growth and demand patterns, it is expected that about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
two-thirds of new housing units to be developed will be in the Gaza strip and the others in West Bank&#13;
cities.&#13;
2.24      Private developers will produce on-site infrastructure, design, construct, and sell qualifying&#13;
housing units, as specified in the Developer's Prospectus. Qualifying units will be determined with&#13;
reference to sales price ceilings based on affordability/eligibility criteria for beneficiaries (households&#13;
with monthly incomes of between US$400 and US$1,000).  The housing will be produced by&#13;
competitive bidding on tracts of state-owned land, or as qualifying proposals on developers' privately&#13;
held lands deemed eligible. Single dwelling plots (mostly in West Bank cities) will range in area from&#13;
22                                              2       2&#13;
125m2 to 250m . Condominium apartments will vary from 90m  to 130m , depending on location and&#13;
site construction cost ceilings established in the call for proposals (on state land) or invitation to&#13;
participate (for private lands). Off-site infrastructure, schools, and community facilities will be provided&#13;
through the MOH, as needed for each development site.&#13;
D.    Program Objective Categories and Environmental Impact&#13;
2.25      The project is classified mainly under the category "Private Sector Development." The&#13;
project is rated under Environmental Category "B." Since the project aims to promote increased&#13;
efficiency in the housing finance system, environmental problems derived from sub-standard housing&#13;
conditions should be reduced. The proposed project will have a beneficial impact on the environment by&#13;
contributing to the orderly development of land and construction by the private sector. New housing&#13;
construction facilitated by the project will be in established population centers, mostly on sites which the&#13;
beneficiaries themselves will select, so displacement and relocation of residents will not be an issue.&#13;
Titles will be awarded to final beneficiaries upon sale of the units. Construction standards are adequate&#13;
to satisfy building and environmental regulations. The project will support the Palestinian effort to&#13;
address the shelter needs of lower-income households, build institutional capacity, improve and protect&#13;
the environment, and create an enabling environment for sustainable private sector development. In the&#13;
short run, the Housing Development and the Demonstration Site sub-component will generate a&#13;
significant number of lower-skilled jobs in urban areas of the Gaza strip where poverty due to under-&#13;
employment is most widespread. This component should also help create and preserve public assets and&#13;
create opportunities for private consultants, contractors and suppliers.&#13;
3. PROJECT FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
A.    Project Financing&#13;
3.1      The project aims to: (a) establish the institutional and policy framework needed for the&#13;
sector-capacity-building investments; (b) provide the seed funding for financing housing mortgages&#13;
and buyer assistance-start-up investments for housing finance; and (c) make available infrastructure,&#13;
construction financing and demonstration units to accelerate the private sector development of lower-&#13;
cost housing units-investments to stimulate development.&#13;
3.2      The proposed project will bring approximately US$30 million equivalent of new public&#13;
resources to the housing sector (US$25 million from TFGWB) in support of the initial four-year&#13;
activities. This will establish the financial mechanisms, install the institutional procedures and capacity,&#13;
and will jump-start the participation of private developers, so that the system can progressively expand&#13;
production over time. The following table shows the sources and applications of funds.&#13;

3.3      The project will also stimulate considerable additional private resources for housing in the&#13;
West Bank and Gaza. The allocation for Infrastructure &amp; Facilities supports the initial demonstration&#13;
site of 1,000 new units as well as infrastructure to service additional sites in West Bank and Gaza cities&#13;
as the program expands. Construction finance, initially for the demonstration project, permits developers&#13;
to quickly and efficiently produce new housing without having to rely solely on their own equity or&#13;
presale. The HAF will offer about 1,000 grants to lower-income home purchasers with the proposed&#13;
allocation which will induce downpayments of at least an equal amount-US$5 million. The SMF (and&#13;
associated MIF) will refinance about 2,000 mortgages in the initial round which will be combined with&#13;
approximately US$10 million from the commercial banks and about US$30 million from household&#13;
downpayments (a combination of HAF grants and recipients savings).&#13;
3.4      The trust fund credit of US$25 million represents 83% of the total project funding. The PA is&#13;
unable to provide cash counterpart funding at this point. However, land representing a value of US$5&#13;
million for the new housing sites is being provided by the PA and will be used to partially fund the HAF.&#13;
The project has been designed in a modular fashion and packaged to permit parallel cofinancing for&#13;
donors after Board approval. Extensive efforts have been made to contact potential co-financiers, several&#13;
have expressed interest.&#13;
3.5      The proceeds of the proposed TFGWB credit will finance: (a) the institutional and policy&#13;
development measures; (b) start-up funding of the Secondary Mortgage Facility (SMF); the Mortgage&#13;
Indemnity Fund (MIF); (c) the incremental off-site infrastructure and facilities; and (d) a demonstration&#13;
program of land, infrastructure and construction finance. These start-up investments will cover a four-&#13;
year period.&#13;
3.6      To estimate the scope of investment needed to launch the production of new housing units,&#13;
the cost of the physical components are calculated on unit costs of housing construction in both the West&#13;
Bank and Gaza. Adjustments have been made to allow for lower costs/standard construction techniques&#13;
and finishes. The level of off-site and on-site infrastructure requirements is calculated for an inventory&#13;
of suitable state lands that could be available for the program, plus unitary estimates for providing off-&#13;
site infrastructure to private lands. The unitary costs represent the best estimates as of June 1996, for the&#13;
development of new housing, and for various types of infrastructure needed. Indicative unitary costs&#13;
(Annex 4), based on anticipated construction specifications are used to establish cost ceilings and&#13;
estimate the number of units that will be developed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
B.     Procurement&#13;
3.7       A large portion of the loan is to be used by the banks as intermediary institutions for SMF&#13;
mortgage refinancing and construction finance loans; these operations will follow commercial practices&#13;
accepted by IDA. Physical components financed under the project include small infrastructure works&#13;
(costing less than US$2 million per item) for which National Competitive Bidding, acceptable to IDA,&#13;
will be the most appropriate procedure, and small quantities of office equipment, fumiture and vehicles,&#13;
for which International and Local Shopping are the most appropriate procedures. Consultants will be&#13;
retained to assist and train the Project Unit (PU) of the MOH and other Project implementation agencies.&#13;
The PU of the MOH will be responsible for monitoring and coordinating the re-lending operation by the&#13;
banks, administering the procurement of the physical components and services, and collecting and&#13;
recording the appropriate documentation. Details of procurement arrangements are summarized in Table&#13;
3 below and explained and justified in Annex 9, which also includes the review requirements.&#13;

3.8       The PU of the MOH will be responsible for managing disbursements. The implementation&#13;
period is four years, and the trust fund credit will be disbursed over a four-year period. The proceeds are&#13;
to be disbursed at the rate of 100%12 of all expenditures as indicated in Annex 10. The disbursement&#13;
percentage, which is the practice in previous credits from TFGWB, are justified by the current financial&#13;
constraints in WBG.&#13;

3.9      Disbursements are expected to begin on July 1, 1997 with implementation completed by June&#13;
30, 2001; disbursements will be completed by December 31, 2001. Most technical assistance inputs (i.e.,&#13;
for institutional development, standards and regulations production, management support activities and&#13;
various capacity building-training, etc.), will be provided during the four-year implementation period&#13;
and will be completed in advance of the closing date. The proposed WBG Trust Fund credit of US$25&#13;
million equivalent will be disbursed against the main categories stated as follows: (i) for mortgage sub-&#13;
loans (US$16.0 million); (ii) for construction sub-loans (US$1.5 million); (iii) for works (US$3.5&#13;
million); (iv) vehicles, equipment and supplies (US$0.25 million); for incremental operating expenses&#13;
(US$0.25 million); for technical assistance, studies, workshops and training (US$0.5 million); and&#13;
unallocated (US$3.0 million). Details of disbursement categories and estimated quantity disbursements&#13;
are presented in Annex 10.&#13;
3.10      The main user of funds will be the SMF, which will withdraw funds on the basis of loans&#13;
made to banks for the refinancing of mortgages. Withdrawals will be made against documentation that&#13;
qualifying loans had been made to eligible households for the purchase of program units.&#13;
3.11      Special Accounts and Required  Documentation.   In order to facilitate quick&#13;
disbursements, three Special Accounts (SA) will be established by the MOF, which will designate the&#13;
MOH, through the PU to handle all disbursement matters: i) for the SMF and the HAF; ii) for the&#13;
construction financing loans; and iii) for the MOH to implement the infrastructure and institutional&#13;
development components. At negotiations it was agreed that these SAs will be established in a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to IDA (para. 7.1). The MOH has been designated by the MOF to manage&#13;
and operate the SAs. The total initial deposits to the three Special Accounts will not exceed US$2.0&#13;
million, representing a four-month expenditure. These SAs will be maintained in US Dollars as separate&#13;
identifiable accounts to be used exclusively for project expenditures and all supporting documentation&#13;
will be retained for ex-post review by IDA supervision missions. The MOH will provide IDA with a&#13;
monthly statement of the special accounts. Applications for replenishment will be submitted on a&#13;
monthly basis, or when the amounts withdrawn are equal to 30% of the initial deposit, whichever occurs&#13;
first. The minimum size of withdrawal applications, except for replenishment applications, will be 20%&#13;
of the authorized allocations to the special accounts.&#13;
3.12      On a monthly basis, or when one-half of the SA deposit has been utilized, whichever comes&#13;
first, replenishment requests will be submitted to IDA with the necessary supporting documentation,&#13;
including monthly bank statement of funds withdrawn from the SA. Disbursements will be fully&#13;
documented, except for the following: Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) procedures will be used for&#13;
disbursements against contracts for works and goods valued below US$250,000; those below&#13;
US$100,000 for consulting contracts with firms; and, below US$50,000 for consulting contracts with&#13;
individuals and for works carried out under force account for which the supporting documentation will&#13;
be retained for subsequent review by local IDA supervisory staff or visiting IDA supervision missions&#13;
(para. 7.2). Applications other than for special account replenishment must be at least 20% of the value&#13;
of the authorized allocation of the relevant special account.&#13;
D.    Accounting, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
3.13      The following accounting and auditing arrangements were agreed at negotiations: for Project&#13;
Accounts, that consolidated accounts will be maintained by the MOH on a basis satisfactory to IDA for&#13;
all components of the project; and for audits, the project accounts, including the Special Account and all&#13;
disbursements against SOEs will be audited separately and on an annual basis by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA and submitted annually to IDA no later than six months after the end of each financial&#13;
year. In order to ensure maintenance of annual accounts on a satisfactory basis and timely completion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
final accounts, the MOH will be staffed with suitably qualified accountants supported by appropriate&#13;
technical assistance (para. 7.1).&#13;
3.14      The following arrangements for project monitoring and reporting were agreed at&#13;
negotiations: that the MOH, acting in close consultation with the MOF, SMF, MIF, and HAF, provide,&#13;
on a quarterly basis, consolidated reports on project implementation progress covering (i) projections for&#13;
project financing and implementation; (ii) the status of project finances, procurement of consulting&#13;
services, goods and works; (iii) training; (iv) incremental operating expenses, vehicles and equipment&#13;
components; (v) statements of income and expenditure for the current and previous quarters; and (vi)&#13;
monthly cash flow projections for the next tw., quarters. Any major variances from budget will be&#13;
explained and corrective measures proposed. These reports will be submitted to IDA within one month&#13;
of the end of the relevant quarter, and will provide the basis for monitoring the progress of the project&#13;
and for discussions at the formal joint bi-yearly reviews (and a formal mid-term review) by IDA and the&#13;
MOH. The half-yearly reviews will be conducted no later than March 31 and September 30 of every&#13;
year. In preparation for these reviews, the MOH will submit annual and mid-year project progress&#13;
reports to IDA no later than four weeks before the date of the half-yearly joint reviews (para. 7. 1).&#13;
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Institutional Arrangements and Responsibilities&#13;
4.1      The PLO will be the Borrower for the benefit of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and will enter&#13;
into a Subsidiary Agreement with the PA with respect to the implementation of the project. Execution of&#13;
the Subsidiary Agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA will be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness. The project will be implemented over a four-year period beginning July 1997 and ending&#13;
June 2001. The Closing Date will be December 31, 2001. The Implementation Schedule is presented in&#13;
Annex 12. Project implementation arrangements are summarized below.&#13;
4.2      Policy  and  Program   Guidance  and  Coordination: Overall policy  and  project&#13;
implementation guidance will be provided by a steering committee comprised of representatives of the&#13;
Ministries of Finance, Housing, Planning and Monetary Authority.&#13;
4.3      Project Implementation: Given the objectives of the project, the MOH will be responsible&#13;
for sector policy formulation and management. The responsibility for implementing specific parts of the&#13;
project will rest with the MOH, which will help establish and build the capacity of the SMF and the&#13;
HAF; and with the commercial banks, which will be responsible for their mortgage operations. To&#13;
coordinate its responsibilities for implementing the project, the MOH has established a Project Unit&#13;
(PU). The Project Coordinator (Assistant Deputy Minister) is responsible for the WBG Housing Project&#13;
and is the contact person, authorized signatory, and project supervisor for the MOH with donors. The&#13;
Deputy Project Coordinator for Development is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the&#13;
project and is responsible for project operations within the MOH, maintaining implementation schedules,&#13;
operating guidelines and project progress reporting. This PU is composed of existing MOH staff&#13;
reorganized to provide the necessary monitoring and reporting functions. The PU will be supported by&#13;
consultants and technical specialists provided by the Capacity Building Component of the project. The&#13;
PU will also draw upon the services of existing MOH departments. At negotiations it was agreed that the&#13;
PU will be provided with full-time technical and administrative support by 3-4 well qualified housing,&#13;
management and finance professionals, and by fixed term consultants to the MOH. The key senior staff&#13;
is in place and a plan to hire additional staff, as needed, has been agreed. These will be financed under&#13;
the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
4.4       The functions of the PU are to provide project monitoring and reporting and to facilitate&#13;
project development and implementation with other MOH departments and with PA institutions,&#13;
municipalities, financial institutions, etc. The PU will also coordinate TA and capacity building&#13;
activities for the MOH and will organize and start operations of financial mechanisms (SMF, HAF, and&#13;
MIF). The PU will engage consultants to conduct studies and research to help define policies for the&#13;
financing and production of lower-cost housing for lower-income groups. Specifically the PU will&#13;
manage the day-to-day functions of the project's implementation. It will encourage and facilitate the&#13;
participation of private developers in the production of lower-cost housing by applying the project's&#13;
operating guidelines and the Developers' Prospectus. The PU will act as the MOH contact point and&#13;
liaison for monitoring and reporting functions of the MOH with the donors.&#13;
4.5       The SMF Organizing Committee (SMFOC), composed of representatives of the MOH, MOF&#13;
and the PMA, worked with the Ministry of Justice to prepare the articles of incorporation establishing the&#13;
SMF. The SMFOC also launched a search for a suitable individual to run the SMF who will be&#13;
appointed as Managing Director as a condition of effectiveness. Signing of a financing agreement with at&#13;
least one commercial bank will be a condition of the credit's effectiveness (para. 7.2). The SMF will&#13;
prepare and submit to IDA an annual Business Strategy which will include, inter alia, the terms and&#13;
conditions of loans to be made to banks originating mortgages (para. 7. 1 ). Similarly, an HAF Task Force&#13;
will be created at the MOH to help structure and launch the HAF operations, and will approve draft&#13;
Regulations and Operational Guidelines, eligibility criteria, the program scale and coverage, and the&#13;
points system. The PU will monitor and assist in the establishment and start up of the SMF and the&#13;
HAF, until those entities have independent status (Annex 6 &amp; 7).&#13;
4.6       To ensure flexibility in the face of uncertain and rapidly changing circumstances, the structure&#13;
of the project and the implementation arrangements will be reviewed at formal, joint half-yearly review&#13;
meetings between IDA and the MOH. A fornal mid-term review will also be jointly undertaken, with&#13;
similar objectives. During these meetings, steps necessary to ensure effective project implementation&#13;
and ensure the attainment of project objectives will be agreed, including, if necessary, steps to restructure&#13;
and re-focus the project and the program. To help provide a framework for project monitoring and&#13;
review, a set of performance and impact indicators were agreed at negotiations. These are presented in&#13;
Annex I 1.&#13;
B.    Supervision Requirements and Monitoring&#13;
4.7       Due to political and institutional issues, implementation of the ERP and WBG  donor&#13;
assistance program incurred initial delays. Border closures, fluctuations in the numbers of Palestinians&#13;
working in Israel, as well as the slow pace of capacity building in general have led to difficulties in&#13;
absorbing assistance. Lessons from ongoing operations in the WBG were used to ensure that this project&#13;
is sufficiently flexible in that implementation can be started on a relatively small scale. In addition, the&#13;
Supervision Plan includes intensive supervision throughout the four years of implementation and&#13;
particular attention during the first year. A Bank disbursement specialist will conduct a disbursement&#13;
workshop for the MOH and financial institutions benefiting from the project. The Technical Assistance&#13;
Trust Fund (TATF) is providing technical assistance for the Ministry on the establishment of centralized&#13;
accounts and internal audit functions'3.&#13;
4.8       The project will be supervised intensively by IDA according to a plan (Annex 12) agreed to at&#13;
negotiations. Particular attention will be paid to supervision of activities leading to the procurement of&#13;
the major infrastructure and facilities to ensure that procurement starts as soon as possible. Special&#13;
3'3 Not part of the design of this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
attention will be given to the launching and start-up activities of the financial institutions and&#13;
instruments. In addition, since supervision missions will be expected to provide substantial technical&#13;
assistance, mission members will be carefully selected with the requisite skills needed to respond to&#13;
issues relating to project activities under implementation.&#13;
4.9      Annual and Final Reviews. Implementation progress will be monitored on the basis of&#13;
annually formulated work plans, and reports sutmitted quarterly by the PU. During negotiations, it was&#13;
agreed that on behalf of the PLO the MOH will: (a) by September of every year, commencing September&#13;
1997, prepare and furnish to IDA an annual work program for the following calendar year; (b) by&#13;
December every year, commencing in December 1997 review that program with IDA; and (c) thereafter,&#13;
taking into account the Association's comments, implement the program in a manner satisfactory to the&#13;
Association. The Annual Review will discuss progress of project implementation over the preceding&#13;
twelve months, propose the work plan for the next twelve months, and resolve project issues.&#13;
4.10      Staff of the PU of the MOH and the financial institutions will coordinate the preparation of&#13;
the Annual Work Program and organize the annual reviews. The MOH will be responsible for all&#13;
evaluation related activities under the project, including: (a) monitoring key project indicators; (b)&#13;
collecting information on project achievements; (c) consolidating information received from the&#13;
financial institutions and other sources; and (d) summarizing information for quarterly presentation to&#13;
the PLO, the MOH, financial institutions, IDA and donors.&#13;
4.11      At negotiations it was agreed that the SMF, MIF, HAF and the financing institutions will&#13;
prepare a plan by no later than July 1, 1997 which will include proposals for: (a) standardizing data&#13;
collection according to key monitoring indicators (to be designed by the SMF and MOH with assistance&#13;
from IDA); and (b) undertaking statistical analyses of mortgages, the HAF and MIF operations. The&#13;
information and analyses prepared will be reviewed with IDA during the Annual Reviews.&#13;
5. ENVIRONMENTAL, CULTURAL HERITAGE AND RESETTLEMENT ASPECTS&#13;
A.    Environmental Aspects&#13;
5.1      The project has been placed in environmental screening category "B" and the procedures for&#13;
the environmental, cultural heritage and resettlement review of activities proposed for project support are&#13;
described in Annex 14. In establishing development norms and regulatory measures for new housing, an&#13;
understanding was obtained at negotiations that the MOH and municipalities will assure that sound&#13;
urbanization, construction and planning regulations are observed and that adequate sanitation, waste&#13;
water, and source water conservation standards are implemented. In addition, housing developments will&#13;
be located on sites deemed appropriate by the MOH and which afford adequate access to public services&#13;
and community facilities for future residents.&#13;
5.2      At negotiations it was agreed that all housing development sub-project sites (state-owned or&#13;
sites proposed by developers) will be subject to screening for potential environmental impact,&#13;
resettlement issues and the protection of cultural heritage, in accordance with local regulatory&#13;
requirements and those of IDA. Interested developers will obtain appropriate clearances according to the&#13;
requirements and guidelines specified in the Developers' Prospectus (Annex 5). They will also be&#13;
supervised during implementation by environmental specialists and representatives of the Environmental&#13;
Planning Directorate (EPD) for the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation and the&#13;
Palestinian Department of Archaeology (PDA) of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. Formal&#13;
clearances will be obtained from the EPD and PDA for all sub-projects proposed for funding under the&#13;
project, consistent with current Palestinian environmental and cultural heritage procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
B.    Resettlement and Antiquities&#13;
5.3      An analysis of the tract of land (Tal El-Hawa) to be used for the demonstration site for the&#13;
first phase of the project, confirmed that there are no formal title holders nor informal encroachers on the&#13;
site and therefore there will be no resettlement. The MOH presented, at negotiations, a plan for&#13;
compensation of a small number of informal fruit tree growers on the site. All necessary clearances were&#13;
obtained by the MOH from the appropriate authorities. No known archaeological or historical sites are&#13;
anticipated to be affected by activities supported under the proposed project due to the need for&#13;
clearances from the PDA. However, given the high density of archaeological and historical sites in the&#13;
West Bank and Gaza, provisions will be made in construction contracts for the use of "chance find"&#13;
procedures should archaeological or historical materials be discovered in the course of project&#13;
implementation. In order to support effective implementation of the proposed project, a series of three-&#13;
day training courses on the application of the Bank's procedures for environmental assessment,&#13;
resettlement and cultural heritage will be conducted in cooperation with the EPD, PDA and the&#13;
implementing agencies. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the MOH will certify that land to be&#13;
used under the project will be screened and cleared consistent with local regulatory requirements and&#13;
those of IDA (Annex 4). It was also agreed at negotiations that, in the event that a site may have a&#13;
resettlement requirement, the resettlement plan shall be reviewed and approved by the Bank (EMTEN),&#13;
before that site is approved for participation under the project.&#13;
6. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
6.1      Project Sustainability: The SMF can meet its initial objective of encouraging mortgage&#13;
lending by a number of commercial banks by refinancing their loans with donor money as proposed.&#13;
However, the sustainability of the SMF itself is critical if the project is to have a lasting effect on the&#13;
housing finance system. Once established, the sustainability of the SMF depends upon its ability to raise&#13;
funds on the domestic and even international markets at some point in the future. At least two rounds of&#13;
donor support may be necessary to build a proven record and reputation before direct mobilization by the&#13;
SMF can be achieved. With this in mind the SMF has been established with detailed oversight in respect&#13;
to its legal structure and governance provisions which will permit and encourage its development as a&#13;
commercially sustainable institution. The two key events in this transition will be equity investment by&#13;
private entities and the collaboration with an experienced technical partner.&#13;
6.2      Initially the credit risk sharing provision of SMF lending is to be treated as a special loss&#13;
reserve, created within, but separate from, the SMF's own resources. The pari passu nature of the&#13;
proposed loss sharing contract with mortgage originators establishes the correct incentives to minimize&#13;
losses. After some experience it may be possible to set up a Mortgage Insurance Fund on a financially&#13;
sustainable basis. In the meantime the MIF strategy offers a transparent way to share risks with banks.&#13;
6.3      Sustainability of the HAF depends on the fiscal health of the PA. Donor funds are required to&#13;
maintain this program at present. However, by setting the levels of assistance much lower than&#13;
previously used in donor housing programs and by requiring considerable financial effort from the&#13;
household first, the HAF may serve as the model for programs which the PA could eventually finance.&#13;
As always, the sustainability of the policies and institutions established by a donor-supported project&#13;
depend on the ownership within the host environment.&#13;
6.4      Benefits. The main benefit of the proposed project will be to put in place an institutional and&#13;
policy framework for the housing sector which will enable housing supply to efficiently respond to the&#13;
demand for more and better housing and will enhance affordability through the development of a&#13;
sustainable system of finance combined with directed assistance to poorer families.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
6.5      Household borrowers will benefit directly through the ability to access mortgage credit to&#13;
purchase housing. Lenders will benefit by the provision of long-term loans and through a reduction in&#13;
their liquidity risk. An increased flow of funds to housing may increase employment in the construction&#13;
industry and promote stability in the economy. A future benefit of the SMF may be to enhance the&#13;
development of long-term debt markets.&#13;
6.6       Suppliers of housing will primarily benefit from the increased certainty of demand based on&#13;
the availability of loans to build and purchase new housing. The competitive private sector led process&#13;
of designing, building and selling the new units will, in an environment of minimal factor price&#13;
distortions, provide incentives to keep the economic return positive on new housing constructed in&#13;
conjunction with this project.&#13;
6.7      Risks. The project seeks to introduce policies and mechanisms which will encourage a&#13;
responsive flow of private resources to the housing sector and the production of more, lower-cost&#13;
dwellings by private developers. The risks associated with a strategy based on voluntary participation by&#13;
private entities are substantial. They are: (a) those risks associated with developing and implementing&#13;
sound public sector policies and institutions necessary for the creation of a conducive business&#13;
environment, (b) the financial and business risks inherent in the highly uncertain economy of the WBG&#13;
and (c) the technical and institutional risks associated with project specific options selected here.&#13;
6.8      Public policy and institutional development is necessarily the core of a project whose&#13;
objective is longer-term sustainable development of the sector. The particular risks are that concept&#13;
development, consensus building, decision-making and successful implementation will take longer than&#13;
expected. There is every possibility that different views and interests will alter progress along the way.&#13;
The robustness of the project concept based on experience in many countries and the lack of credible&#13;
alternatives, make this risk worth taking. Similarly, the banks and developers may, from time to time, be&#13;
reluctant to play the expected role in the time-frame forecast. Anticipating changing circumstances, the&#13;
project has been designed with flexibility in several key areas which affect the incentives to private&#13;
business. The technical and institutional risks of the project design are largely related to unknown&#13;
reaction of the market to the proposed solutions. Again, the incremental nature of project outputs allows&#13;
for adjustment and mitigation of this risk.&#13;
7. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1      Agreements and understandings were reached at negotiations on: (i) the vesting of the&#13;
responsibility for the housing finance component in the SMF and other parts of the Project in the MOH;&#13;
(ii) the submission on an annual basis, by the SMF, of a Business Strategy (para. 4.5); (iii) the details of&#13;
the Demonstration Site and its development, including selection criteria for developers and approval of&#13;
projects according to the Developers 'Prospectus (para. 2.21 and Annex 5), (iv) the terms and conditions&#13;
of construction loans to developers for the Demonstration site (para. 2.22) and (v) the process and timing&#13;
of a preparation of a full plan for institutional and policy development (para. 2.10); (vi) conditions&#13;
pursuant to which funds on-lent to participating banks will be passed on the beneficiaries (with&#13;
safeguards against the financing of land) (para. 4.5 and Annex 6); (vii) the details of procurement,&#13;
disbursement, accounting and reporting requirements including the establishment and operations of the&#13;
Special Accounts (para. 3.11); and (viii) the scope, content and modalities of the formal annual and mid-&#13;
term joint project and program reviews (paras. 4.9, 4.10 and 4.1 1).&#13;

Mr. Kemal Dervis&#13;
Vice Prsident, Middle East and North Africa Reg,on&#13;
The World Bank, Washingtm D.C.&#13;
The purpose of this lettr is to inform the World Bank about the housing policy and the howing strattgy&#13;
of the Palestinian Autbonty.&#13;
lousing can play a major rle in the socal and economic development of Palestine. It aUeviates one ot&#13;
the mosm obvious conditions associated with poverty amd ganerates economic activily ano employment.&#13;
The successfu plhnning and managemgnt of human settlements requires, however, financial and&#13;
technical resources as well as improved capacity for positive change through institutional improvements.&#13;
We, the Palestinians, um at the initial sage of natioobuilding and, therefore, have not yet developcd a&#13;
complete or adequate framework for houing policy. However we fully acknowledge the importancet of&#13;
the housing sector in the developzental process of owr nation.&#13;
Okicedvcs f  the H=sina SeG   id  be, LMolcationis for 11gusin  yQc&#13;
Our long-term objeutive for housing policy is to provide all Palestitians with .adequate shelter at&#13;
affordable pnces even for the lower income brackets. This meaus that all people will evenru ally be able to&#13;
enjoy the stability and securty of more suitable housing and thus will be better able to make maximum&#13;
conriburion to the proslrty of Mhe nation. We expect all ctizens to be able to choose wvhere and how&#13;
they wish to be homsed. We seek an efficient and equitable housing sector. Efficiency rvcams that our&#13;
citizens get as much housing as pible for the issurcus udlized and equity means that e ^.n the po-rest&#13;
have access to decent housing.&#13;
Our strategy for achieving tbese objeclives is to adopt an enabling role for government in the housing&#13;
sector. This means that we will rely primarily an the actons and the resources of privute i"idividuals and&#13;
firms to make a stong and vibrant market for housing. Government efforts will be focmused in tbree areas.&#13;
First, to assist those mcst in need. We will do this dirctly by offering support to disadvantaged and&#13;
deserving grops and indirectly by making all housing more affordable. Second, the government will&#13;
regulate the housing sector in all necessary aspects for the benefit of all participants. The objective of&#13;
regulation will be a housing market where everyone can easily, quickly and efficiently cany out their&#13;
activities. Tird. the government wil spply citical infasutture In support of housing developmenit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
We expect this projec to be a vehicle for the further development and implemnentation of our srtlegy for&#13;
housing. In particular, we intend to use the policy and institutional component as a mechanism lo&#13;
examine. debate and strengthen our intentions ad owu ability to cny tbetn aout. We will seek the views of&#13;
all parties -with a stake in housing and provide an oppoutunity for them to contribute to the directions we&#13;
take. Ihe Ministry of Housing will develop its own ole better dough this process to citable us to guide.&#13;
lead and enable other pazties. Wc intend to focus in paicular on the coades and regulations wbich govern&#13;
housing development as well as the support which our builden and developers need to upgradc their&#13;
activities. The demonstraion site and the Developers' Prospecus approach arc both lahoratories for&#13;
tesdag these ideas in Palestine.&#13;
The sitnation of those no( able to take care of themselves in respect to bousing is of paznmount&#13;
importance to the govenment and the Ministry. 'Under this projea we intend to launch the Housing&#13;
Assisunce Fund which wfil target thos able to purchase now modest housing through their own efforts&#13;
augmented by an affordable gr_L We intend to monitor closly the impact of this progrum as a mean to&#13;
structure ur broadex' and ftzinc assistance pTogams.&#13;
We recognize that broadly avdlablh long-term fitiancr for housing will have the greatest impact on the&#13;
performance of our shelter actor. For this reason, we join with the World Bank in launching a facility&#13;
(the SMF) which wilI not only use donor rsources at the beging to stimulate mortgage lending by the&#13;
commercial banks but which can be built into a sustainable institution to serve all of our poople. Together&#13;
with the private institutions which make up our financial system, we intend to create a legal and policy&#13;
euvironsr;^nt which incouraps safe and sound investment in this sctor.&#13;
In summary, ws wish to inform you that it is our intention lo pursue a policy for the housing sector which&#13;
builds upon the strengths and resources of al participants The public role wil be to facilitate, to enable&#13;
orhers. not to replacr them We intend to use our relationship with the internadonal community to benefit&#13;
our policies and prgm  here in Palestine.&#13;
We wish to continue and expand out cooperation with the World Bank&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
Features of the Housing Development Component&#13;
The Housing Development Process&#13;
1.      The project aims at quickly putting in motion a process to test and demonstrate viable options&#13;
in the special political, institutional and developmental constraints facing Gaza and the West Bank. The&#13;
Housing Development Component helps the MOH put in place a mechanism that encourages private&#13;
developers to produce lower-cost housing. The MOH guides the process of housing development on: (i)&#13;
tracts of State-owned land provided with off-site infrastructure on which private developers will bid for&#13;
the production of qualifying housing units-either low-rise condominium apartment units or single&#13;
family houses; (ii) qualifying private lands with apartments and/or single family houses proposed and&#13;
produced by private developers, (iii) single plots of private land for either single-family houses or low-&#13;
rise condominium apartments or cooperatives.&#13;
2.      Because the Housing Project launches the process without the benefit of a full set of tested&#13;
policies nor with experienced institutions, the project's approach is one of learning-by-doing. The&#13;
concepts, and options proposed are intended to: (a) quickly respond to the urgent need to provide&#13;
affordable, appropriate housing to lower- and middle- income households presently without options; and&#13;
(b) test the options with a view to helping shape policies and capacities to attend to the growing process.&#13;
3.      The development of land and houses will be done entirely by the private developers. Houses&#13;
and condominiums will be sold, not leased nor rented, on the basis of installments or final sales,&#13;
depending on the availability of buyer finance and mortgage collateral. The goal is to have lower cost&#13;
units and sales prices that reflect full cost recovery. Complementary and parallel to these objectives is&#13;
that of helping define policies and strategies that will encourage and foster a vigorous housing market.&#13;
4.      The role of PA Institutions. The Ministry of Housing will supervise the fulfillment of the loan&#13;
obligations and implement the project on behalf of the PA. The MOH will oversee the operation in terms&#13;
of consistency with general sector policies. The MOH will guide the process by which developers&#13;
produce housing units on state or private lands that qualify under the project's financing and assistance&#13;
programs. To do so the MOH will use a normative instrument called the Developers' Prospectus, in&#13;
issuing specific calls to developers for proposals to develop specific state lands or to make proposals on&#13;
developers' own lands (the model document is in Annex 5).&#13;
5.      Municipalities. will have a supporting role, regulating and approving zoning, construction&#13;
activities, and in providing maintenance and municipal services to the completed project areas. The&#13;
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project, FY96 (No. 43339) is providing technical assistance to&#13;
municipalities to build their capacities to provide this support.&#13;
6.      The Role of the Developer. The types of private developers operating in Gaza and the West&#13;
Bank range from very large international firms with the capacity to produce over one thousand&#13;
apartments per year to small, family-led operations building a few dozen units annually. The bulk of&#13;
housing construction aimed at the lower end of the housing market is presently covered by the smaller&#13;
developers (building up to about 100 units, and a very large number of single-site developers building or&#13;
expanding existing apartments). The project will encourage the participation of all developer types. For&#13;
this reason the Developers' Prospectus will have editions geared to each site and type of developer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 14&#13;
7.      Development options. Developers are encouraged to test a combination of dwelling types, such&#13;
as partially finished core dwellings and low-rise condominiums-all ways of reducing the purchase price&#13;
of a unit, while making it more adaptable to the buyer's preferences. There are considerable differences&#13;
between Gaza and West Bank cities with respect to land availability, land costs, topography and&#13;
traditional housing practices/preferences. The program will be flexible in developing options for each&#13;
locality, based on those considerations, but also intends to demonstrate the viability of housing types and&#13;
development options. The type of units and condominiums and their proportional distribution will vary,&#13;
based on local demand and land/ characteristics as determined by the developers. There is a tradition of,&#13;
strong market preference for, condominium apartments in the Gaza strip. This is linked to land scarcity&#13;
and cost, as well as to a desire for extended families to live in close proximity. On the other hand,&#13;
preferences in the West Bank cities are likely to be for single household core units that can be expended&#13;
and completed over time by the buyer. The distribution of units and types will respond primarily to&#13;
market forces.&#13;
8.      The developer will market and sell the units.  The developer will propose designs and&#13;
marketing strategies using the Developers' Prospectus as a guideline. Qualifying design proposals&#13;
(based on sales price, minimum structural and design characteristics, and responsive to good&#13;
development practices), will be eligible for buyer financing, the housing assistance fund, etc., making the&#13;
marketing features more attractive to developers and buyers. The size of core units will be determined&#13;
by the developer based on a knowledge of market preferences, but apartment buildings will not to exceed&#13;
5 stories. Tracts of developed land will likely have a mix of plot/unit types. This will encourage&#13;
maximizing densities and land values within each site, and increasing the efficient use of scarce land.&#13;
9.      Role of the purchaser. Households have the option to buy either apartments or single-family&#13;
units as produced by the private developers. Depending on the type of unit marketed, a buyer may want&#13;
a unit which an be expanded or completed over time, as household income allows. Individual&#13;
households purchasing a single-unit plot with basic infrastructure (water, sewerage and storm drainage,&#13;
and electrical connectors), core dwellings or condominium units which could be partially finished to&#13;
allow for immediate owner occupancy and completion/expansion in stages, depending on the owner's&#13;
ability to pay for improvements. Basic partially-finished units adopt more easily to individual needs and&#13;
preferences. This also provides the option of self-help construction or contracting to small construction&#13;
firms.&#13;
10.     Compatibility with on-going programs. Certain elements of the proposed housing component&#13;
will lend themselves to complement or be logical extensions of on-going donor programs, and could be&#13;
funded as such. Specific sites and/or components such as community facilities could be earmarked for&#13;
funding and development of donors on agencies presently active in these areas.&#13;
Land for Development&#13;
II.     Developers will be offered to make bid proposals for specifically selected, reviewed and&#13;
cleared and tracts of State-owned land for development. Alternatively developers may make proposals&#13;
on privately-owned land, which will meet specific review and clearances as described below. For&#13;
purposes of the project, MOH will not use lands which have formal title holders or informal encroachers&#13;
which will require relocation , nor will it use lands which have graves. Therefore it is not likely that sites&#13;
will involve involuntary resettlement nor the relocation of graves. In the event that such a condition&#13;
arises, all activities which require involuntary resettlement will be reviewed by both the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Site Review and Clearances&#13;
12.    For each tract of land to be used under the project, the MOH the following clearance procedures:&#13;
a.     An assessment of the off-site infrastructure needs for each site. This investigation will&#13;
take into consideration the infrastructure and services needs of the adjacent communities&#13;
as well as the plans which the corresponding municipalities have for developing the&#13;
surrounding areas.&#13;
b.     The MOH, in consultation with the relevant municipalities will prepare a report on each&#13;
site containing the site location and characteristics data, topography, boundaries,&#13;
special features/constraints, off-site infrastructure requirements, etc. Maps and&#13;
development costs estimates for infrastructure servicing will be prepared.&#13;
c.     A review concerning environmental, resettlement and cultural heritage issues as&#13;
outlined in the documents: (a) Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment;"&#13;
(b) Operational Directive 4.30, "Involuntary Resettlement;" and (c) Environmental&#13;
Assessment Sourcebook Update Number 8, "Cultural Heritage in Environmental&#13;
Assessment.". The requested review of the sites will determine the suitability of each&#13;
proposed site for housing development, as formally reviewed and cleared by both the&#13;
Environmental Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Planning and International&#13;
Cooperation and the Palestinian Department of Archeology of the Ministry of Tourism&#13;
and Antiquities. The IDA will also require detailed information on possible resettlement&#13;
of residents, businesses and/or agricultural operations at these sites whether the affected&#13;
parties have a formal or informal right to the use of these lands. This information will be&#13;
used by the IDA, supplemented by site visits and consultations by affected parties, to&#13;
determine measures which will be incorporated into the Project supported activities to&#13;
address these concerns.&#13;
13.     Required additional actions. Prior to approval by IDA of state lands to be used in the project,&#13;
the following actions will be undertaken by the concerned cooperating Palestinian organizations with&#13;
regard to the proposed sites:&#13;
a.     Consultation with Physical Planning Department. Consultations will be conducted with&#13;
the Physical Planning Department of the Ministry of Planning and International&#13;
Cooperation to assure the proposed actions are consistent with the principles of the&#13;
Physical Master Plan for the Gaza Strip and the Special Physical Master Plan for Gaza&#13;
City. Information will be provided to IDA concerning the outcome of these&#13;
consultations.&#13;
b.     Environmental Review and Clearance. The Environmental Planning Directorate of the&#13;
Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation will be contacted and requested to&#13;
conduct an environmental review of proposed Project activities to be undertaken at both&#13;
sites to assure they are consistent with current Palestinian requirements. The preparation&#13;
of this review may require a field visit by representatives of the Environmental Planning&#13;
Directorate to the concerned sites. It is requested that a formal record of this review&#13;
concerning the acceptability of the proposed activities be obtained from the&#13;
Environmental Planning Directorate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 4 of 14&#13;
c.     Resettlement and Compensation Issues. Under the provisions of the IDA the potential&#13;
impact of the proposed Project activities on parties with both formal and informal land&#13;
use rights at all sites need to be evaluated. Compensation may be required for parties&#13;
with informal rights as well as for those with formal rights. It is requested that the&#13;
following information be collected and made available for IDA review:&#13;
d.     Legal Status of the Site. Information will be provided which evaluates the official land&#13;
ownership status of the proposed site and identify any outstanding claims or disputes&#13;
concerning title to all or any portion of this site.&#13;
e.     Survey of Current Land Use on the Sites. A map will be prepared for each of the sites&#13;
which shows the current land use, including both authorized and unauthorized activities.&#13;
This will identify areas which are being used for informal housing or have structures,&#13;
locations of grape and fruit trees, sand excavation and waste disposal sites, and other&#13;
uses.&#13;
f.    Identification of Formal and Informal Users. A list will be made which will be keyed to&#13;
the map which will identify to the fullest extent possible the names of the formal and&#13;
informal users and provide information on the basis for their land use activities on the&#13;
sites. To the extent they are available information or copies of leases or other&#13;
authorizations for agriculture or other activities will be collected.&#13;
g.     Estimation of Potential Compensation for Formal and Informal Users. Preliminary&#13;
information will be prepared concerning potential costs of compensation for parties with&#13;
either formal or informal land use rights. This will include costs for the relocation of&#13;
squatters, relocation of structure, payment for trees and grape vines, etc.&#13;
h.     Archaeological Review and Clearance. The Palestinian Department of Archaeology of&#13;
the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities will be contacted and requested to conducted an&#13;
archaeological and historical sites review at the proposed housing development sites. It&#13;
should be anticipated that this will require a preliminary field survey to be conducted by&#13;
archaeologists acceptable to the Palestinian Department of Archaeology. It is requested&#13;
that a formal record of this review concerning the acceptability of the proposed activities&#13;
be obtained from the Palestinian Department of Archaeology.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
The Demonstration Site: Tal El-Hawa&#13;
1.      Land for Phase 1: the Demonstration Site at Tal El-Hawa. The MOH has identified three&#13;
tracts of State-owned land in the Gaza Strip that are suitable and reserved for the project. The sites could&#13;
accommodate approximately 6,000 units, depending on type and design. The largest site called Tal El-&#13;
Hawa (described below), is located in Gaza City, has a capacity of about 3,800 units, and is planned for&#13;
an incremental development and including the MOH program of Housing Co-operatives, which are&#13;
invited to apply for financing and assistance under the project. A first development phase of about 1,000&#13;
units is programmed for the Demonstration Site, where the development process will be tested and the&#13;
first call for proposals by private developers will take place. The other sites, as well as those in West&#13;
Bank cities, could be available at a later stages of the project.&#13;
2.      Tal El-Hawa. The site has an area of 406 dunums (40.6 ha.) and located about 3.0 kms. south&#13;
of Omar Al-Mukhtar street inside Gaza municipal boundaries. The site has an irregular shape but due to&#13;
its large size and having main streets surround it from three sides make the site very good potential for&#13;
development. It is also possible to adjust the irregular boundary form the north side by making some&#13;
trade-off with land owners on that side. The original site topography is fairly flat, but due to sand&#13;
extraction and excavation activities has created large areas which will require filling and leveling at the&#13;
time of development. The Demonstration Site will be about 55 dunums within the Tal El-Hawa site.&#13;
MOH plans to also develop a program for housing cooperatives at Tal El-Hawa, which will be planned&#13;
and developed so as to assure complementarity.&#13;
3.      The off-site infrastructure needed to service the site requires some additions and improvements&#13;
to existing nearby water and drainage mains. The access road adjacent to the site from the west needs&#13;
paving and upgrading of existing high tension power lines. Some water wells are also being dug next to&#13;
the site to supply Gaza city with water, which will also supply the site.&#13;
4.      The site has a potential of accommodating over 175 one-dunum plots, each capable of housing&#13;
16-20 apartments ranging in area between 100-130 m2. Total site capacity is estimated at about 3800&#13;
families, or about 26,000 persons, when fully developed.&#13;
5.      Planning And Design Criteria For Tal El-Hawa Site. The following are special features of the&#13;
preliminary designs of the Tal El-Hawa site, that assure development efficiency, appropriate land use,&#13;
provision of amenities and integration to the surrounding city fabric. These are to serve as a guide in&#13;
preparing the final designs as well as guide of future developments.&#13;
6.      The fundamental efficiency criteria is the design of the circulation network, utility&#13;
infrastructure and plot subdivision, while reserving sufficient area for necessary schools, clinics, and&#13;
other public uses. The individual plots will be allocated to other entities either co-ops or private&#13;
developers who will undertake the detailed design and construction of the buildings. Approximately&#13;
4000 units are planned for the site. The reserved open space for public uses will be designed separately.&#13;
7.      Road Categories. Roads are grouped into 4 categories, instead of 6. The right of way (ROW)&#13;
widths lOim and 14m are not used in this scheme. The road widths recommended are:&#13;
a.     30 m: Main highway Route #8, planned by municipality on south side of the site.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4a&#13;
Page 6 of 14&#13;
b.     16m.  Main N-S and E-W internal roads structuring development and connecting to&#13;
outside of site. These will contain the main infrastructure lines, and they are presumed&#13;
attractive to commercial uses parallel to the roads.&#13;
C.     12m. Internal circulation roads.&#13;
d.     8m. Secondary access roads to plots, considered with parking and small open spaces.&#13;
8.      Parking.  The interior streets (8m  ROW) include parking spaces for abutting buildings.&#13;
Additional spaces will need to be provided on the ground floors of the buildings to accommodate future&#13;
automobile ownership.&#13;
9.      Slope of the E-W central access road. A deep depression results in a 8% slope on the spine, the&#13;
maximum for vehicular traffic. This pit requires a booster pump to drain properly. Fill was considered,&#13;
but will be costly and a booster pump will still be required.&#13;
10.     Four Categories of Plot Sizes are considered:&#13;
a.     a one dunum plot: Standard 1000 m2. plots (30x33m or 25x40m), as customary in Gaza.&#13;
These will be located along wider streets.&#13;
b.     3/4 dunum plot. An alternative 'standard' in the range of 750 to 850 m2. (24x35m,&#13;
22x35m, etc.) to test the acceptance of smaller, more economical plots. They are located&#13;
in lower value, interior locations, on smaller streets.&#13;
c.    large plots. Prime location plots, increased for anticipated additional commercial&#13;
demands; generally located on corners. Area and size varies, generally over 1 dunum.&#13;
The plots also provide the flexibility in the land subdivision geometry.&#13;
d.     special plots. Odd plots resulting from the irregular shape of the site. The target is to&#13;
keep the area greater than 750 m2., preferably larger to facilitate fitting buildings into&#13;
the irregular plot.&#13;
11.     Allocation of Plots for Co-operatives. A bidding process is proposed for plots that are not the&#13;
standard one-dunum plot, with a premium price set for special location; larger sizes; 3/4 dunum plots; the&#13;
odd sized plots, etc. All plots will have a pro-rata cost premium added for infrastructure development&#13;
cost, added on a per square meter basis.&#13;
12.     Infrastructure Service Connections. Water and sewer service connections are recommended to&#13;
be brought to each property edge in the initial infrastructure contract. The added cost is justified because&#13;
of the anticipated rapid development, and the avoidance of digging up the street for connections;&#13;
connection costs will be paid for by developer/co-operatives.&#13;
13.     Connection to Adjacent Developments. The internal streets have been extended to allow future&#13;
connection to streets in adjacent developments. The goal is to maintain a network integrity to facilitate&#13;
circulation at the city scale. Future developments should be encouraged to accept the improved road&#13;
alignments. The extensions of roads on the site are unpaved with only ROWs demarcated. As adjacent&#13;
development occurs, infrastructure will be extended through these ROWs and the surface paved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4a&#13;
Page 7 of 14&#13;
14.     Design of Public Areas. For the areas designated for the housing co-operatives, the large&#13;
public open spaces require detailed planning to accommodate the schools, parks, planting reserves and&#13;
commercial areas. This may be done by the MOH in the continued development of Tal El-Hawa.&#13;
15.     Staging. Four areas of staged development are designated (site plan).&#13;
a.     The first requires the installation of a major infrastructure line connecting the 30m road&#13;
with the existing networks on the north side, and installation of interior networks for an&#13;
initial 46 plots. This stage defines the large public open space, with areas for a school&#13;
and clinic, and defines the commercial areas for sale at market rate. The commercial&#13;
areas are largely located in site depressions, which can provide for the additional costs of&#13;
building foundations.&#13;
b.     The second stage requires only interior infrastructure networks, paralleling interest by&#13;
developers in the demonstration portion.&#13;
c.     The third stage requires extension of the main infrastructure line as well as interior&#13;
networks. This stage assumes that allocation mechanisms, financing, etc. have been&#13;
satisfactorily tested in the initial stages and the largest number of plots can rapidly be&#13;
provided (86).&#13;
d.     The last stage completes the network with connection to the adjacent areas. Only 14&#13;
plots will be allocated, in addition to schools and other services necessary at the final&#13;
densities.&#13;
16.     Increasing Heights of Buildings.  Initial considerations limited the height to 5 stories as&#13;
customary throughout Gaza. However, in order to increase the number of units on the site, and to&#13;
maximize value of certain plot locations, it is advisable to zone the site for multi-story buildings to adjust&#13;
to the size of co-operatives - from 16 members (5 stories) to 32 members (9 stories). The ground floor of&#13;
each co-op will be reserved by parking or commercial uses. A table is attached which indicates the&#13;
maximum number of units in the Tal El-Hawa site according to height of building.&#13;
17.     Allocation of these higher rise buildings is suggested along the 16m ROW streets. The wider&#13;
streets provide extra space to accommodate the effects of the increased height.&#13;
18.     Elevators will be necessary if over 5 stories, despite 1) the extra cost; 2) the irregular electricity&#13;
supply, and 3) the lack of repair services. Considerations also need to balance the added cost of&#13;
construction with building height.&#13;
19.     Density. Appropriate density for development is difficult to determine and subject to much&#13;
debate. Five stories are customary in Gaza and thus considered providing acceptable densities. The&#13;
setbacks of 2m, 3m and 4m (if enforced) provide sufficient 'breathing space' between units - a 3m&#13;
sideyard results in 6m of space between buildings, a 4m backyard results in a 8m space. The higher&#13;
buildings will be limited to the 1 6m ROW streets and in many cases fronting the larger open spaces, both&#13;
which provide extra space between dwellings on the front. The large amount of open space in deference&#13;
to the existing plantings provides additional relief from a too high density.&#13;
20.    Comparison of Preliminary Layout Options. The preliminary infrastructure calculations, costs,&#13;
and road profiles, for the preparation of the tendering documents is the "first Plan". The "second plan"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Note: Calculations are approximate but sufficiently accurate to give a general indication of project&#13;
layout efficiency and preference. Total street lengths include all public access circulation.&#13;
* Elimination of the interior block streets lowers the total length to 7, 621m.&#13;
21.     Beit-Lahia (El-Atatra). The site that could b used by MOH for developers' participation is&#13;
composed of two separated large parcels, the first has an area of 195 dunums and the other 55 dunums.&#13;
Both parcels are near each other in the same locality within Beit-Lahia municipal boundaries. Both sites&#13;
have fairly flat slopes but some squatting has started on the smaller plot. High tension power line is on&#13;
the site boundary. A number of water wells are available in the area and supply the area as well as Gaza&#13;
city with water. Total site capacity is estimated at 2300 families.&#13;

HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
Land for Low-Cost Housing&#13;
1.      The availability and use of land is one of the critical issues facing WBG development. How&#13;
land is used allocated and planned for are central to the housing sector. Politically, economically, as well&#13;
as technically, land management is the most difficult function facing the sector.&#13;
Land Inventory&#13;
2&#13;
2.      Gaza Strip. Gaza Strip has a total area of 360 km  and a population estimated at 1,050,000.&#13;
There are four major urban centers namely Gaza, Dir El-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah. Due to high&#13;
density of the population, the urban centers (areas within Municipal or sub-municipal jurisdictions) are&#13;
often linked or interconnected. Refugee camps and settlements of makeshift (temporary types or&#13;
squatter) housing dwellings have been in place for decades. According to IJNRWA estimates some 65%&#13;
of Gaza Strip inhabitants are registered UNRWA refuges of whom more than half live in camps and have&#13;
an income of around $200 per household per month. Within urban centers, undeveloped land is scarce,&#13;
commanding very high prices, out of reach of low income households. Outside municipal boundaries&#13;
there are about 250 hectares of State-owned land, most of which could be earmarked for housing&#13;
development. However at the present time, development approval for these lands requires lengthy and&#13;
difficult approvals from Israeli authorities. The total land distribution for the Gaza Strip is shown in&#13;
table 1, below.&#13;

(3) State land squatted upon in 23 sites (localities).&#13;
(4) Land available for new development.&#13;
3.     Summary. In Gaza Strip, only about 250 ha. of State-owned lands are available for development.&#13;
Of those, only about 180 ha. are within present municipal boundaries. The largest share (460 ha.) of land&#13;
for potential housing development is privately owned. The vast majority of those lands are small plots-&#13;
below 8 dunums. There are very few large tracts of undeveloped lands (private of State-owned)&#13;
available within existing municipalities.&#13;

Potential Land for the Project-Gaza&#13;
4.      The MOH identified the State lands that will be suitable and available for the proposed project.&#13;
Three sites were agreed to, and reserved for the project, in a letter from the Minister of Housing, dated&#13;
Oct. 15, 1995. The sites are:&#13;
a.    Tal El-Hawa, located in Gaza Municipality, totaling 406 dunums (see Annex 4a).&#13;
b.    Two sites in El Atatra, located in Beit Lahyia Municipality, one totaling 195 dunums and&#13;
one totaling 55 dunums.&#13;
5.      These sites, if fully allocated for use under the Project, could accommodate a large share (over&#13;
6000 units) of the project. However it is understood that there will also be new housing units developed&#13;
in several West Bank municipalities. It is also anticipated that developers participating in the project&#13;
could propose private lands for development in any of the municipalities. The distribution of units will&#13;
therefore depend on sites made available during the implementation of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4b&#13;
Page 12 of 14&#13;
6.      The Tal El-Hawa site will be the focus of the first phase of the project. Therefore the technical&#13;
preparation of the site includes a plan for the staged development of the site is prepared, along with the&#13;
development plan for the first 1,000 units.&#13;
Potential Land for the Project-West Bank Cities&#13;
7.      Three main urban centers in the northern part of the West Bank are considered by MOH&#13;
potential sites for housing development (primarily for single-family schemes).  These centers are&#13;
Toulkarem (population 40,000), Jenin (population 40,000) and Nablus (population 150,000). These three&#13;
towns are among the first major urban centers turned over to PA for self-rule. Other urban centers in the&#13;
West Bank include: Ramalla (40,000), Beireh (40,000), Jericho (20,000), Bethlehem (20,000), and&#13;
Hebron (80,000). A survey of the most appropriate lands for development is summarized below.&#13;
8.      Toulkarem. Toulkarem consists of the city center built on a flat terrain surrounded by four&#13;
distinct areas that were villages in the past but are now part of Toulkarem Municipality. Green fields&#13;
separate some sections of the city but are privately owned and under cultivation. These sites are not&#13;
2&#13;
suitable for low cost housing because of their agricultural use and high cost ($200/m ). Fairly good&#13;
water, electricity and road networks are available all throughout. The four areas surrounding the center&#13;
lack sewerage system but this service is to be handed under a separate program. Land new few housing&#13;
schemes is available in sufficient quantities along side the main artery crossing the town from cost to&#13;
West just before entering Municipal boundaries coming from Nablus. One site has over 100 hectares of&#13;
2&#13;
state land estimated at 415/m . The main constrains are: steep slopes of 20% and the forestation on the&#13;
upper edges of the site. The other identification site is smaller in area (17 hectares) and owned by&#13;
Muniicipality of Anabta. Access road and electricity are within 100 meters from the sites but water-&#13;
mains and sewer truck lines are 5 km. away. (The sites are opposite each other.) The site in Anabta site&#13;
2&#13;
has a similar value of $15/mr&#13;
9.      Jenin. In Jenin, two sites were identified. One is called "M\arah Sa'ad" with an area of 12.5&#13;
hectares with reasonable slopes but with thick forestation. The site is state owned and off site main's are&#13;
within 300-1000 meter distance from site. Cost of land is $40/m2 because it falls within municipal&#13;
boundaries. The other site, El-Hadaf, is also within municipal boundaries it has a total area of 20&#13;
2&#13;
hectares and are estimated cost $ 1 0/mr&#13;
10.     Nablus. The city is built on two opposite mountains with the city center located in between.&#13;
The main highway crosses the from cost to West passing through the center. The city has 150,000&#13;
people with fairly raped expansion as it is considered the main urban center in the northern region of the&#13;
West Bank. The city dwellings seem to have sufficient basic infrastructure services basically water,&#13;
electricity and access roads. Sewerage networks cover areas of the city. Hence upgrading schemes seem&#13;
to be non-existent. As regards new sites development, four sites were identified-two on each mountain.&#13;
The price of land ranges between $70-170/m . One site has thick forestation and very steep slopes&#13;
reaching 30%. The other sites have no forestation but also have steep slopes ranging from 30-40%.&#13;
However, all sites within Municipal boundaries have steep slopes but these are the only parcels of&#13;
substantial size for housing development and are also state land.&#13;
11.     Ramalla/Biereh. Both towns are joined together forming one urban center of 80,000 people&#13;
(split equally between both towns). Ramalla spreads westward towards Beir Zeit but has very small&#13;
amounts of State lands. Vacant land between Ramalla and Beir Zeit has steep slopes and slopes away&#13;
from the city which makes it difficult to drain its sewage by gravity towards Ramalla. Provision of off-&#13;
site infrastructure in terms of roads and water will also be very costly and hence area west ward from&#13;
Ramalla is not suitable for large housing schemes. However, east of Biereh, There are few state and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4b&#13;
Page 13 of 14&#13;
Wakf land (administered by Ministry of Religious Affairs ) suitable for housing. The most suitable&#13;
location is known as Shiban site located (2.0) kms. east of Biereh center. The site area is 29 (ha) which&#13;
makes it feasible for a housing project of 1000 new units. The site slopes into two wadis draining&#13;
towards Beireh. Estimated cost of land is $2/m2.&#13;
12.     Jericho. The Jericho self-rule area has a potential of 2125 hectares of state land located in&#13;
Jericho, Ouja, Duke and Nweimeh areas. Most sites are under 10 hectares and few are above. The most&#13;
suitable site recommended for new housing schemes is located in Duke which is 1.0 km north-east of&#13;
Jericho city center. The site area is 26 (ha) and has a flat terrain. Off-site access road and water main is&#13;
1.0 km away, and sewage can be drained by gravity towards Jericho in the future (when Jericho and&#13;
surrounding localities will be served with sewerage system). The site is suitable for development of&#13;
about 800 housing units. Estimated cost of land is $5/m2.&#13;
13.     Bethlehem. Bethlehem has a population of 20,000 people and located south east of Jerusalem&#13;
by about 5 kms. There is no State land available within municipal boundaries. There is one site of 7&#13;
hectares of state land located south of town on the way to Hebron close to Dheisheh Refugee Camp. The&#13;
land has a slop of about 15% and has an estimated value of $ 30/m2. All basic infrastructure services are&#13;
passing near the site. The site will be appropriate to house 300 units.&#13;
14.     Hebron. Hebron has no state land either inside nor outside municipal boundaries. However&#13;
there are a few privately owned lands suitable for housing development. Further investigation will be&#13;
made to assess other possibilities. There are three potential sites. The first site is owned by The Russian&#13;
church which is willing to lease to the Municipality of Hebron for 99 years. The City Mayor stated that&#13;
lie would pursue the matter. The site has an area of 10 hectares outside Hebron located in Beit Ummar&#13;
10 kms. north of Hebron. No services are available near the site. The other potential site is privately&#13;
owned by one family and has an area of about (15-20) hectares. Cost of land is estimated at $8/m2.&#13;
Infrastructure mains are away from site by about 600 meters. No sewerage system is available in the&#13;
area. Slope of site is about 20%. The site is called Kabrah (Beit Kahel land) 3.0 km outside Hebron&#13;
municipal boundaries. The third site is called Ukbet Ingeel, 2.0 kms south of Hebron. The land is owned&#13;
by one family and has an estimated value of $9/m2. All basic infrastructure mains are 2.0 kms. away&#13;
from the site. The site has a rocky land and slopes of 10%. Total site area is about 15-20 hectares&#13;
suitable for a housing project of 450-600 housing units.&#13;

HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
The Developers' Prospectus and Procedures for Developer Participation&#13;
I.    The agreed draft model documents of the Developers' Prospectus are to be used by MOH to&#13;
invite participation of private developers, or to call for private developers to present housing proposals&#13;
on private lands. These documents will be the instruments used by the MOH to guide developers in the&#13;
production of housing for the project. The draft prepared is for developers who will bid on tracts of State&#13;
land such as the Tal El-Hawa site. There are similar documents prepared for cases where developers put&#13;
forward proposals with their own land. There is also be a document for use by smaller developers. These&#13;
are in the project's file.&#13;
2.     The prospectus is the document that will invite developers to participate in the project and that&#13;
spells out the rules, responsibilities, and roles of the MOH, the developers and other agencies such as the&#13;
municipalities. The prospectus provides guidelines on eligibility, pre-qualification, proposal submission&#13;
(forms, etc.) and evaluation criteria.&#13;
Summary Description&#13;
3.     The Developers' Prospectus is the instrument used by MOH to encourage the participation of&#13;
private developers in the Housing Project; explain the process for participating, and facilitate their&#13;
application to participate in the production of housing on a tract of State-owned land, proposed by the&#13;
Ministry of Housing for this purpose.&#13;
4.     The prospectus is a call for proposals from development companies for the production of low&#13;
cost housing through a competitive bidding process involving a partnership with private developers&#13;
and the MOH. Therefore private development firms are asked to submit recommendations for designs,&#13;
preliminary engineering plans, cost estimates, specifications, and implementation plans for tracts of state&#13;
land which the MOH will make available for development.&#13;
5.     The various sections of this document are intended to help the developer understand the process&#13;
and to prepare and submit a proposal to participate in the project.&#13;
6.     There are three types of documents (i) a Prospectus for inviting bids on large tracts of State-&#13;
owned land; (ii) a Prospectus that invites developers to submit qualifying proposals on private land;&#13;
and (iii) a highly simplified version for small developers using small or single building sites of private&#13;
land. The Draft Prospectus for use with State-owned lands follows.&#13;

THE HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING&#13;
Program Overview&#13;
I.    There is a growing need to help the lower income families of Gaza and West Bank cities to buy&#13;
appropriate, affordable housing. There are obstacles to making suitable land, infrastructure and financing&#13;
available for the construction and purchase of low cost housing units. There is a need to draft and update&#13;
existing laws, regulations and procedures concerning the development process to make it easier and&#13;
advantageous for developers to produce housing for lower income Palestinian families. The Ministry of&#13;
Housing and the municipalities are taking measures to stimulate and guide a process to encourage the&#13;
efficient production of affordable and appropriate housing for households with monthly incomes between&#13;
US$400 and US$1,000. To do so, the MOH is seeking private developers to participate in a program that&#13;
will test a system of design, construction and financing appropriate to existing circumstances in the West&#13;
Bank and Gaza-The Housing Project.&#13;
The Housing Project&#13;
2.    The PA Ministry of Housing (MOH) is the implementing agency for The Housing Project,&#13;
supported and funded by the World Bank and other donors. The main objective of the housing project is&#13;
to remove obstacles in the production and purchase of low-cost housing for low- and middle-income&#13;
Palestinian households.&#13;
3.    To accomplish this the project seeks to stimulate and guide investment for low cost housing by&#13;
making land and infrastructure available, finding ways to make the housing affordable, providing&#13;
financing for buyers and developers and to make it worthwhile for private developers to produce&#13;
appropriate housing for these households.&#13;
4.    The MOH is also:&#13;
*  making recommendations for revising relevant regulations and procedures and&#13;
encouraging the rapid development of lower-cost housing;&#13;
*  applying appropriate, least- cost housing designs for the lower- income groups;&#13;
*  involving local techniques, materials and contractors;&#13;
*  encouraging cost-lowering options such as the provision of partially finished units that&#13;
could be finished by purchasers.&#13;
5.    The overriding goal of this program is to provide sound, appropriate housing that is affordable to&#13;
low- and moderate-income households. There are two ways which this housing is made affordable: a) by&#13;
reducing total development costs; and, b) by packaging financial resources for the buyers, such as&#13;
financing and access to the Housing Assistance Fund.&#13;
6.    This prospectus describes in detail (Part 4), the steps to be taken by the MOH and the&#13;
participating Developer to produce housing units.&#13;

Part 1: Guidelines for Developer Participation&#13;
This section provides the requirements that the participating developer must meet. It explains how&#13;
developers will be deemed eligible to participate in the project..&#13;
Definitions&#13;
1.    For purposes of this project a Developer is considered to be a private company established and&#13;
chartered to operate in Gaza and the West Bank, for the purposes of financing, designing, building and&#13;
selling housing units. Consortia of contractors, investors, land owners, and architectural and engineering&#13;
firms are also considered to be Developers.&#13;
Registry of Developers&#13;
2.     The first step for a Developer to participate in the program is to register with the PA Ministry of&#13;
Housing (MOH). This registry describes the Developer's experience, capacity, and financial solvency.&#13;
By registering with the MOH developers will be informed of future development opportunities for&#13;
producing housing on state lands.&#13;

Part 2: General Proposal Guidelines&#13;
This section provides the participating developer proposing to submit a bid to develop a tract of State-&#13;
owned land witl information on wlhat considerations must be addressed in the proposaL It explains&#13;
what can and cannot be included in the proposaL&#13;
Design Standards and Parameters&#13;
1.    The site should be developed with the following general requirements:&#13;
* The site is to be developed for residential use, mixed residentisi and commercial uses, and&#13;
other associated uses, such as limited commercial, community facilities, parking, and open&#13;
spaces.&#13;
*  A minimum  density of   _   units, or _        persons per-hectare is recommended.&#13;
(Buildings should maximize the number of units that can be developed.)&#13;
* Land for residential use (areas to be sold) should be no less than 60% of the total site area.&#13;
* Land areas circulation (streets, etc.) should be no more than 25%, with a target of 20%.&#13;
* Land for public facilities, open space, etc. should be a maximum of 20%, with a target of&#13;
10%.&#13;
* Efficiency of land use, innovation and appropriateness to buyers needs, functionality of the&#13;
site plan, building configuration, and parking and other amenities is encouraged&#13;
* All open space should be delineated legally and accurately and relate directly to the&#13;
individual buildings/units.&#13;
* Plot proportions should be in a minimum ratio of 2:3, with the narrow dimension fronting the&#13;
access street.&#13;
2.    Buildings (houses and apartments) should be designed with the following general guidelines:&#13;
* Apartment buildings should be a maximum of five floors.&#13;
* Plot coverage ratio should be no more than 70%.&#13;
* Viability and requirements of off-site infrastructure needed.&#13;
3.    Other desirable features of the proposal are:&#13;
* Strong emphasis on a well defined marketing plan.&#13;
* A mix of unit sizes, costs and types attractive to a range of family sizes and incomes.&#13;
* Provision of community facilities or amenities to enhance the quality of the dwelling&#13;
environment.&#13;
Zoning Guidelines&#13;
4.     All construction on the site is subject to the Zoning Regulations of the Municipality of in which&#13;
the development will take place. For example the code mandates the maximum height, number of stories,&#13;
sizes of plots, building coverage, etc. Selected proposals must either satisfy the zoning regulations or&#13;
obtain a variance. MOH will help coordinate and expedite the application of zoning variances, if needed.&#13;
5.     For all tracts of land (sites) being proposed, developers should first assess the most efficient and&#13;
appropriate parcellation layout, types of units (and their mix), and the numbers of units to be developed.&#13;
This should be done with preliminary site designs (plot layouts, circulation/access networks, public&#13;
spaces, community facilities -  if any- , infrastructure to be provided on the site, connections to&#13;
existing networks, etc.). In addition proposals should be presented for the types of housing units to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 7 of 13&#13;
developed on the site, options in terms of sizes, costs, development methods (contractor/owner built or&#13;
finished, etc.), construction specifications, schedules of materials and finishes, etc. Unit prices (house or&#13;
apartment type) and complete site development cost estimates and sales price estimates should be&#13;
prepared based on the preliminary engineering studies. Developers should also review existing laws,&#13;
rules, regulations, standards, including those proposed in this call for proposals, to make&#13;
recommendations that might improve or make more appropriate the designs and layouts proposed. Using&#13;
those, Developers may make recommendations to adjust the development standards for the site.&#13;
Developers may analyze alternative changes to zoning considering, inter-alia, existing development&#13;
densities and uses, infrastructure loading issues and consistency with overall city development plans,&#13;
including expected patterns of social and economic growth.&#13;
Calculating Price, Costs and Financing&#13;
6.     Total development costs for all proposals will be compared and evaluated. Proposals that provide&#13;
the best product for the lowest selling price will be most competitive.&#13;
7.     The developer will market the finished buildings and apartments as owner-occupied housing.&#13;
Buyers may apply for buyer financing to [names of commercial banks] and apply for the Housing&#13;
Assistance Fund through the Ministry of Housing. However developers can also propose alternative&#13;
financing resources which could be used to make these projects more affordable. For example, if a&#13;
developer has access to financing which can be used, this can be proposed for the project. Alternative&#13;
financing plans should clearly describe the financing source, ownership structure, project time lines, and&#13;
what affordability levels will be.&#13;
Guidelines for Defining the Selling Price&#13;
8.     The following assumptions should be used for calculating the total development cost and&#13;
proposed selling price of a housing unit.&#13;
* If your proposal is selected and you are requested to build a different number of buildings&#13;
and/or number of apartments, the MOH will then negotiate a new final price.&#13;
*  For the specific site the land price is: $_   per square meter.&#13;
* Include the costs for any technical evaluation such as sub-soil tests, etc. that may be to&#13;
design and build the project.&#13;
*  Identify and include the cost of any problems or unusual costs associated with connections to&#13;
off-site infrastructure.&#13;
* Include costs for all survey work. Survey work should include costs for any engineering&#13;
plans required to obtain permits and approvals to sell complete units.&#13;
* Include all legal fees associated with the project, including obtaining the necessary permits,&#13;
and selling the units.&#13;
* Include all fees associated with obtaining construction financing (if needed).&#13;
* Include all carrying costs for the construction period plus 30 days.&#13;
* Include all other development fees such as architectural, utility hookups, permit fees, etc.&#13;
* Include any costs for marketing the units.&#13;
* Review Part 3, Specific Proposal Guidelines, for specific building requirements and&#13;
standards, and include costs for these items.&#13;
* If your proposal /price contains any conditions or constraints, specify those.&#13;
9.     The total development costs quoted are made up of all physical (construction) costs, the given&#13;
price of the land, development/license fees, overheads, fee or profit, and any premium or allowance paid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

for timely or advance completion, etc. This total development cost should also reflect the delivered sales&#13;
price of each finished apartment unit, and the whole building, including its share of the total site&#13;
development, including profit and contingencies. Successful applicants will sign a contract with MOH to&#13;
sell the units/buildings at that price. Developers should make sure the price is one that they can deliver&#13;
on.&#13;

Pricing and cost-lowering guidelines&#13;
10.     To ensure that the units produced are affordable to the intended income groups (households&#13;
earning about US $ 400 to US $ 1,000 per month) the Developer is encouraged to explore design options&#13;
that lower the selling price of a unit. One options that could be used is to offer construction options as&#13;
follows:&#13;

As a guideline for the design of the proposal, the following price guidelines are suggested:&#13;
Unit size                                                 Skeleton            Minimum  Finish             Basic&#13;

Marketing and Housing Finance Initiatives&#13;
11.      The PA  has created  a Housing  Financing  Initiative with  the objective  of stimulating  and&#13;
encouraging the provision of affordable housing to all employed households in the West Bank and Gaza.&#13;
The Housing Finance Initiative provides:&#13;
* Home buyer financing for qualified borrowers through private financial institutions-&#13;
[participating commercial banks to be listed here].&#13;
cost estimates are based on mid-1995 prices of larger scale projects, including on-site infrastructure, net of the cost of land; and on a&#13;
I OOm2 unit.&#13;
21  Skeleton is a building with foundations, structural columns, beams, roof and about 50% of intemal block walls. Included are&#13;
infrastructure connections and fees (water and electricity) and building permit fees. This option is marketed for families or co-&#13;
operatives that want to complete the unit to their own specifications over time, as they can obtain the financing to do so.&#13;
31  hlininuwn Finish is a unit as above, plus lowest-cost extemal finishes, doors and windows; some intemal doors, basic plumbing,&#13;
electrical conduits, and drains in bath and kitchen. Families that want a lowest-cost unit that they can move into, and upgrade or&#13;
develop the interior finishing and room configuration to their specifications over time.&#13;
X   Bsic includes the features of the Minimum Finish, plus modes quality tiles for all floors, all internal doors and partitions, power&#13;
receptacles and fixtures, interior paint, and exterior plastering and painting.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
Features of the Housing Finance Component&#13;
Purpose&#13;
1.    In order to stimulate and encourage the provision of affordable housing to all employed households and&#13;
encourage fnancial sector development in WBG, the project seeks to create a sound and sustainable financial system&#13;
that features an effective set of institutional mechanisms for providing housing finance. At the core of such a system is&#13;
the provision of credit by private financial institutions to qualified borrowers. The project supports the creation of&#13;
specialized institutions to reallocate a portion of mortgage risk and enhance the affordability of housing.&#13;
2.     The project helps establish the Palestinian Secondary Morgage Facility (SMF) as an private shareholding&#13;
company with the purpose of providing long-term finance to banks to reduce the liquidity risk incurred in mortgage&#13;
lending. The operations of the SMF will also produce an excess interest rate spread (described below) tha will&#13;
facilitate credit risk sharing with banks making mortgage loans to qualified borrowers within WBG. The excess&#13;
spread, termed the Mortgage Indemnitv Fund (MF), will be operated by the SMF apart from its normal refinancing&#13;
operations. Both the provision of long term loans to banks and the sharing of credit risk will facilitate the introduction&#13;
of mortgage lending in an uncertain economic, legal and regulatory environment. The activities of the SMF and the&#13;
MIF will increase the flow of funds to housing and improve the affordability of housing finance in WBG. In addition,&#13;
as the SMF moves to raising funds through the issuance of bonds it may contribute to the development of the local&#13;
capital market.&#13;
3.     The institutional structure within which the SMF will operate is shown in Figure 1. It will raise funds initially&#13;
through long-term loans from donors which will be made to the Palestinian Authority, the official borrowing entity.&#13;
The borrower will make these funds available to the SMF which will on-lend the funds to qualified banks in WBG.&#13;
The terms of the on-financing agreement between the banks and the SMF will include the definition of qualified&#13;
mortgage loans, standards for bank documentation, loan terms, reporting and underwriting and the extent of bank&#13;
provision of mortgage loans from own funds. These terms and conditions are discussed in more detail below. The&#13;
MWF will use the excess spread from SMF operations to provide credit risk sharing to banks.&#13;

Structure&#13;
4.     Organization. The SMF has been registered on March 10, 1997 (# 563122563) as a shareholding company&#13;
for the purpose of providing long-termn finance for qualified mortgage lenders. The two founding shareholders are the&#13;
PA and the PMA. Each has subscribed $1,000,0000in equity and the initial authorized capital is $6.0 million.&#13;
5.     The SMF will have a Founding Board of Directors appointed by the PA. In its initial configuration, the&#13;
SMIF will have five directors:&#13;
Public Directors One representative of the Ministry of Finance, one representative of the&#13;
Ministry of Housing and one representative of the Palestine Monetary Authority; and&#13;
Private Directors Two senior representatives. One from a financial institution qualified to do&#13;
business with the SMF and one from the housing sector to be nominated by the Minister of&#13;
Housing.&#13;
6.     The founding shareholders will invite private institutions, commercial banks in particular, to invest in the&#13;
SMF at as early a date as possible. Private shareholders shall be able to vote their shares as soon as their capital is paid&#13;
in and the board shall be restructured as soon as the equity paid-in by private investors is double than of the public&#13;
owners (i.e. $4 million from private investors and a total capital of $6 million). At that time, envisioned to occur&#13;
within 18 months of creation, the shareholders will elect representatives to the Board of Directors. The Board will be&#13;
reconstituted as follows:&#13;
Public Directors One representative of the Ministry of Finance, one representative of the&#13;
Ministry of Housing and one representative of the Palestine Monetary Authority; and&#13;
Private Director Four Directors elected by shareholders and the Managing Director, appointed&#13;
by the Board.&#13;
7.     Regulatory and Tax Treatment. As a unique and specialized institution in WBG, the treatment of its loans&#13;
and securities, lending and investment authority and tax status must be determined in advance. The regulations should&#13;
ensure that the SMF operates in a safe and sound manner and that qualified banks have an incentive to use the&#13;
services of the institution. SMF advances should be exempt from any future PMA reserve requirements as they&#13;
represent a source of liquidity and long term finance. SMW debt securities, when issued, should be eligible&#13;
investrnents for banks and institutional investors, reflecting their high credit quality. The securities should be accorded&#13;
a lower risk-based capital weight of 20 percent as interbank debt obligations. As a financial institution, the SMF will&#13;
be supervised by the Palestine Monetary Authority. The PMA will establish capital adequacy requirements for the&#13;
SMF and monitor both the financial condition of the SMF and its adherence to its charter powers.&#13;
Sources of Funds&#13;
8.     Donor Fun. The initial source of funds for the SMF will be long termn loans from donors. These funds will&#13;
be available on a variety of terms and conditions (and currencies) ranging from heavily subsidized loans (e.g., World&#13;
Bank TFGWB on IDA terms) to near market-rate loans. In general, it is anticipated that donor funds will be long term&#13;
in nature (i.e., over 10 years) at fixed rates of interest.&#13;
9.     Own Funds. The SMF will generate own funds through the repayment of principal and interest on its loans&#13;
and eventually through the issuance of debt and obtaining bank loans. The SMF will obtain equity from investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
10.    Ban*ing. The SMF will need to establish normal banking arrangements (i.e., having deposits in and&#13;
receiving a line of credit from one or more local banks).&#13;
Uses of Funds&#13;
11.    Loans. The primary activity of the SMF will be the provision of long term loans to qualified mortgage&#13;
lenders. The terms of the loans can be simple (e.g., non-amortizing term) or complex (amortizing, prepayable)&#13;
depending on the needs of its customers. In general, its loans will be long term (e.g., 7 to 10 years or more) facilitating&#13;
liquidity risk management of mortgage lenders. Initially, the loans will be secured by an assignment by the bank to&#13;
the SMF of all or part of the bank's right to the security underlying the bank's loan together with a general obligation&#13;
of the bank to repay the SMF.&#13;
12.    The terms and conditions of the loans will specify the requirements for the participating banks. The&#13;
requirements will include (but not be restricted) to the following:&#13;
a.     registration of a mortgage against the home of the borrower;&#13;
b.     definition of an eligible mortgage;&#13;
C.     specification of a set of standard loan terms, documentation and underwriting&#13;
requirements;&#13;
d.     requirement that the bank match SMF loan funds (e.g., 70% SMF funds and 30% bank&#13;
funds); and&#13;
e.     specification of the reporting and servicing requirements of the banks.&#13;
13.    An example ofthe lending relationship between the banks and the SMF is shown in Figure 2.&#13;

Page 4 of 6&#13;
14.    In this example, the SMF will provide 70 percent of the funds made available to borrowers and the&#13;
participating bank will provide 30 percent. The SMF will make a loan to the bank at a fixed rate of interest (e.g., 7.5&#13;
percent) and the bank will add a fixed margin (e.g., 2.5 percentage points) to cover its administrative costs, risk and&#13;
profit.&#13;
15.    Investments. The SMF will invest in high quality government issued or related securities in order to manage&#13;
its liquidity risk and enhance the MTF.&#13;
16.    The SMF will earn a spread -between its funding and loan rates. This spread will be used to cover its&#13;
administrative costs and risk. In order to fund the Mortgage Indemnity Fund (NM) (discussed below) most of this&#13;
spread will be transferred to the MIF as a reserve against future default loss.&#13;
Mortgage Indemnity Fund (MIF)&#13;
17.    The MIF is structured as a facility to share default loses on mortgage lending. The formula for sharing will&#13;
be agreed in advance, most likely on aparipassu basis. Loans eligible for MIF risk sharing will be restricted either by&#13;
borrower income or house price in order to encourage banks to move down market as they introduce mortgage&#13;
lending. The MIF will be segregated from the operations and capital base of the SMF. Total claims on the NI4F are&#13;
limited by the transfer of funds from the SMF which will grow with SMF operations.&#13;
Palestinian Secondary Mortgage Facility: Organization Structure&#13;
18.    Structwue. In general, because the SMF will be a purely wholesale, institution, dealing in relatively few but&#13;
large financial transactions, its staff and expenses should be much smaller relative to assets employed than the typical&#13;
retail deposit-taking bank. The suggested basic organization of the SMIF is shown below.&#13;

Staffing&#13;
19.    Managing Director. This individual will be responsible for creating the organization. He/she should be an&#13;
experienced banking executive with strong knowledge of finance financial markets in particular, strong&#13;
entrepreneurial and marketing drive and the necessary personal standing for political and capital market credibility.&#13;
Education Graduate degree in business administration or economics with an emphasis on finance&#13;
or accounting.&#13;
Experience At least five years of experience at a senior level with a financial institution. The&#13;
candidate should have considerable administrative and decision-making experience and at least&#13;
five years of experience with a financial institution in an Arab country.&#13;
20.    Staff Functions. The legal department reports to the Managing Director (MD). The Legal staff should&#13;
include expertise in both real estate and banking law. In the early stages of development, the Legal department may&#13;
also include the human resources function of the SMF. Internal Audit reports functionally to the Board and&#13;
administratively to the MD. Internal Audit needs to be a strong function, reflecting the high credit quality of the&#13;
institution and the need for strong internal controls (e.g., credit risk and asset-liability management).&#13;
21.    Line Functions. Three principal line functions are suggested:&#13;
a.     Credit. Conservative and effective management of credit is essential to the success of the&#13;
SMF. The Credit department must provide thorough analysis of financial institutions,&#13;
including developing information sources to monitor the performance of and trends in&#13;
and comparisons across its bank borrowers. The SMF must obtain on a timely basis&#13;
financial information on the performance of its borrowers and their mortgage portfolios.&#13;
One aspect of the Credit function will be to conduct field audits of its borrowers (e.g., to&#13;
check on documentation, underwriting and performance of mortgagc portfolios). The&#13;
Credit department will have the immediate responsibility to create the Credit Policy of&#13;
the SMF which will require the approval of the Board. The Credit Policy will contain,&#13;
among other items, appropriate documentation, underwriting and servicing guidelines&#13;
for bank mortgage lending funded by the SMF, appropriate reporting requirements from&#13;
the banks to the SMF, and the appropriate collection and loss documentation procedures&#13;
of the banks. In addition, the Credit Policy will set the standards for qualification of&#13;
individual banks as a borrowers of the SMF (e.g., staffing, capital adequacy,&#13;
procedures). The Board will approve all on-lending contracts with individual banks. The&#13;
head of the Credit function should have significant experience in the analysis of and&#13;
extension of credit to financial institutions as well as the underwriting of loans to&#13;
consumers (in particular housing loans).&#13;
b.     Finance. The key Finance function is the management of the SMF's own investment&#13;
portfolio, liquidity, exchange rate and interest rate risk and, in general, the maintenance&#13;
of a well controlled, conservative balance sheet. Finance will have the immediate&#13;
responsibility to create the Asset-Liability Management Policy of the SMF, which will&#13;
require approval by the Board. In the future, if the SMF begins issuing its own debt&#13;
securities, Finance will be responsible for management of relationships with investors,&#13;
capital market regulators, underwriters, market makers and rating agencies. The Finance&#13;
function includes both financial accounting and the preparation of public statements, and&#13;
managerial accounting including budgeting, cost analysis and performance&#13;
measurement. The head of the Finance department should have significant banking and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
capital market experience.&#13;
c.     Operations. The Operations function has the responsibility for transaction processing&#13;
which keeps the SMF functioning day-to-day, as well as various support services. Thus&#13;
its responsibilities include funds transfer, safekeeping, collateral administration,&#13;
information technology development and data processing, loan processing, purchasing,&#13;
management of the physical premises, security, internal and external mail and&#13;
telecommunications, etc. Its top priorities are efficiency, control and cost effectiveness.&#13;
A key role will be to develop the data processing systems that will allow the facility to&#13;
obtain and analyze real time information from its customers. The head of the Operations&#13;
department should be an individual with significant operational experience in a banking&#13;
institution.&#13;
22.    Transition Staff It is not expected that the SMF will be fully staffed prior to making its first loans. At a&#13;
minimum, the SMF must have hired a Managing Director, obtained office space and administrative help, retained&#13;
local counsel to structure its initial contracts with borrowers, and hired both a credit analyst to assist in reviewing bank&#13;
mortgage lending procedures and developing a database to track performance and a financial analyst to begin&#13;
developing the SMF's intemal asset-liability management reports and guidelines.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
Housing Assistance Fund: Organization and Operations&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The proposed Palestinian Housing Assistance Fund (RAF) is designated to provide targeted&#13;
assistance to low- to moderate-income households for the purchase of a primar7 residence. Households&#13;
will utilize their own savings and loans from banks in conjunction with grants from RAF to purchase&#13;
housing in the $20,000 to $30,000 price range. The HAF will provide funds (or reduced priced inputs&#13;
such as land) directly to households, thereby maximizing the transparency and equity of the program.&#13;
Direct provision of funds allows the Ministry of Housing to target those households most in need of&#13;
support and ascertain that benefits flow to the intended recipients. The grants will be conditioned on the&#13;
savings performance of Palestinian households, thus leveraging scarce donor funds and providing a&#13;
transparent basis for allocating funds. By providing a strong incentive for saving, the fund can reduce the&#13;
credit risk of bank mortgage lending, both by increasing the downpayment for residence purchase and by&#13;
providing banks with a positive signal about the financial capabilities and discipline of households. The&#13;
amount of assistance will be based on need, with those at the lower end of the proposed income range&#13;
receiving the largest amount of assistance.&#13;
2.     Beyond the scope of the present housing project it is intended to develop RAF as the institution&#13;
that permanently assumes responsibility for personal assistance programs in Palestinian housing policy.&#13;
Future HAF functions could include housing allowances for rental tenants, support of savings that&#13;
households could devote to housing, and support for the renovation and upgrading of homes. RAF will&#13;
thereby exercise a core function of Housing Policy; following the guidelines of the Ministry, but&#13;
operating independently.&#13;
3.     The structure of the HAF is shown in Figure 1. It will raise funds from donors, through both&#13;
direct grants and the concessionary portion of loans, and from the Palestinian Authority through the&#13;
contribution of land and funds. Using guidelines developed by the Palestinian Ministry of Housing, the&#13;
HAF will allocate grants to qualifying households. Qualification for and level of assistance will be based&#13;
on household characteristics, such as saving a necessary amount, and on obtaining a loan from a&#13;
mortgage lender in West Bank and Gaza (WBG).&#13;
Since the only resource available to HAF at the outset is public land, the initial grants will be in the form of reduce&#13;
charges for land to households deemed eligible. The full procedure discussed here will be put in place as other&#13;
resources become available to the HAF.&#13;

4.     By all accounts, there is an enormous demand for housing among the residents of the WBG. A&#13;
majority of the residents of these areas live in overcrowded units, particularly those living in the refugee&#13;
camps. Much of the problem can be attributed to extended, multi-generational families that share a single&#13;
dwelling unit. A core issue is therefore to enable the families of the second and third generations to&#13;
finance a home, thereby alleviating the overcrowding of the remaining families and at the same time&#13;
catering to the demand for homeownership. These so-called nuclear families (couple and unmarried&#13;
children) are typically not the homeowners of the dwellings they share; their head of household will be in&#13;
his twenties or thirties and have a strong motivation for initiating a continuous process of savings&#13;
towards purchasing his own dwelling.&#13;
5.     Although there is a strong desire among these families for their for own homes, it is difficult to&#13;
translate this desire into effective demand due to low and unsteady income. Under the present level of&#13;
house prices, a standard unit which costs $50,000 would only be affordable for families with a net&#13;
income over $1,200, provided there is 70% loan-to-value debt finance available. As a consequence of the&#13;
unavailability of both formal finance and housing assistance, large amounts of personal savings of&#13;
families in the low- and middle-income ranges remain unmobilized. The HAF is intended to help tap&#13;
these resources by assisting those families who in principle could get a bank loan for the purchase or&#13;
construction of a home. It is envisaged that eligible households will fall within a target income range for&#13;
support that will allow them access to the homeownership market.2 Starting from this point, the intention&#13;
is to push down the threshold for formal financing among families ranked by their income as far as the&#13;
limits of available funds for housing assistance allow.&#13;
6.     Because present economic and administrative circumstances in WBG limit the number of&#13;
families with formal income documentation, care must obviously be taken over whether income is&#13;
feasible as the main parameter for assistance. In principle, altematives are available: for instance,&#13;
limiting the maximum house price, or restricting assistance to certain, well defined groups. If funds were&#13;
less limited, giving a flat housing assistance to all prospective homeowners will be a feasible strategy.&#13;
However, the strategy is to develop the foundations of an economically sustainable program with&#13;
minimal susceptibility to political and economic intervention. This approach requires necessarily the&#13;
2 Lower-income households will continue to have access to other assistance programs, including rental assistance&#13;
and home improvement grants from agencies such as UNRWA and USAID.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 3 of 14&#13;
continuous development of standard income documentation in cooperation-operation with the PA entities&#13;
involved. There are numerous approaches to providing personal assistance for housing. Experience has&#13;
shown that a very effective approach is the provision of cash assistance directly to families to support&#13;
their downpayment or periodic housing expenses. Cash based assistance can be targeted most effectively&#13;
to those in need, is transparent to donors, and can be managed on a cost effective basis (particularly&#13;
relative to in-kind assistance wherein housing units are built for recipients). Furthermore, cash-based&#13;
assistance to households does not distort financial institutions or markets and need not distort housing&#13;
markets if production is relatively free to respond to demand. The assistance will most likely be given as&#13;
an up-front subsidy as a substitute for bank loans, thereby reducing the threshold needed to obtain formal&#13;
finance. Substituting bank loans rather than buying down the interest paid on the loan has the further&#13;
advantage of maximizing the financial return on the assistance while reducing administrative costs for a&#13;
limited assistance program.&#13;
7.     A major issue in providing housing assistance payments to residents of WBG is equitability.&#13;
Ideally, benefits should be distributed to those most in need based on a consistent demand oriented&#13;
program that does not discriminate among families other than by setting some general guidelines. A fully&#13;
demand driven program will presuppose a steady source of budgetary financing for housing assistance&#13;
which is not available at this point in time. Eligibility criteria for the program will therefore be&#13;
formulated in a rather restrictive way, so that all further administrative steps taken by HAF will have the&#13;
character of queuing up families rather than creating a second, non-transparent selection mechanism.&#13;
This strategy has the advantage of minimizing public expectations and reducing the potential discomfort&#13;
of families that devote much time and effort to applications. Eventually, eligibility criteria will be&#13;
reformulated in order to broaden the range of families who will be considered for assistance. The&#13;
institution building aspect here is to establish the principle of self-selection of applicants, breaking with a&#13;
long standing tradition of administrative discretion.&#13;
8.     The eligibility criteria for assistance will rely on the subsidiary principle, enabling families that&#13;
can contribute some of their own resources for housing to leverage scarce donor funds, while&#13;
maintaining a maximum income limit. A program that makes use of existing savings and the&#13;
accumulation of new savings for housing can expand the pool of long-term resources in the economy. If&#13;
such resources are accessible to financial institutions, they can support increased lending and reduce&#13;
funding risks. In order to qualify for assistance, families must present a finance and savings plan for the&#13;
planned investment, thereby fostering a substantial commitment to housing finance that further reduces&#13;
the risks of mortgage lending.&#13;
9.     The amount of savings will be the primary basis upon which households are prioritized to&#13;
receive assistance. In a first phase, sufficient downpayment capacity for the fulfillment of the financing&#13;
plan will be required in order to start the program. This restriction will soon be relaxed, allowing for a&#13;
period of 9-15 months over which the household can accumulate funds for downpayment in a formal&#13;
savings plan with the participating banks. The households that demonstrate a stable savings behavior&#13;
over the required period will be given priority. Requiring potential beneficiaries to generate savings&#13;
provides several advantages:&#13;
a. The accumulated savings used toward the down payment will lower the need for assistance,&#13;
thereby stretching donor funds;&#13;
b. If the savings are to be deposited in a bank account over a period of time, the household&#13;
shows his discipline to set aside money on a regular basis, providing a signal about the&#13;
creditworthiness of the household;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 4 of 14&#13;
c. Generating savings over a period of time assists in managing the time sequencing of the&#13;
program. Because housing will become available only gradually, the phased savings plan&#13;
assists in matching housing availability with the eligibility of program beneficiaries.&#13;
10.   In addition to savings performance, the family size and income as well as the housing situation&#13;
of the family will be taken into account. Prioritization will also reflect special social situations, such as&#13;
single parenthood or special groups defined by the PA, as far as these families are eligible for formal&#13;
sector finance. HAF will develop a limited capacity to survey the applicants on a random basis, in order&#13;
to minimize a misuse of the program.&#13;
l.    Families selected for housing assistance that can produce the necessary downpayment will be&#13;
given grants which, when combined with a loan from a financial institution, will allow them to purchase&#13;
a modest cost house. HAF will play the role of an intermediary between the family and the participating&#13;
banks in case of disagreement. The assistance will be accessible to the customers of any bank lending to&#13;
qualified families. Banks will play the role of assisting the borrower's application for housing assistance&#13;
in order to realize the envisaged financing plan.&#13;
Structure&#13;
12.    Organization. The Housing Assistance Fund (HAF) will be an official government entity&#13;
charged with providing cash grants to assist households in obtaining housing. The HAF will be&#13;
administered by the Ministry of Housing according to guidelines developed jointly between the Ministry&#13;
and donors based on information on surveys of WBG households. These guidelines will be reviewed&#13;
annually. HAF will, however, operate and select beneficiaries independently from the Ministry.&#13;
13.   Procedures. The most important design element of HAF from a political and an institution&#13;
building point of view is the application procedure. There are two competing sequences:&#13;
a.    Direct HAFApplication. Families may apply directly to the HAF, bringing all necessary&#13;
documentation. HAF will maintain an extensive customer relations service, which will&#13;
assist families in applying. HAF will register the application, establish the total number&#13;
of points for the household, and decide upon eligibility and priority. After appropriation&#13;
of the subsidy, the household will receive a voucher and then approach a bank for a loan.&#13;
In the first stage of the project, banks contracting with the SMF will also have to check&#13;
the eligibility criteria for benefiting from an SMF-refinanced loan.&#13;
b.    Pre-Screening by Banks and Consequent HAFApplication. Initiating the application&#13;
procedure in a bank that contracts with the SMF will be the principal alternative. Based&#13;
on a specific contract structure with SMF (which requires a minimum lending to low-&#13;
income households), banks will advertise the program, thereby announcing both the&#13;
existence and guidelines of HAF. During the first stage of the project, while the&#13;
availability of SMF refinancing is limited, banks will select borrowers by dividing their&#13;
family income into three baskets:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 5 of 14&#13;
*      families not eligible for an SMF-refinanced loan (basket A);&#13;
*      families eligible for an SMF-refinanced loan, but not eligible for HAF assistance&#13;
(basket B);&#13;
*      families eligible for an SMF-refinanced loan and HAF assistance (basket C).&#13;
14.    The bank and the prospective client belonging to basket C will strive to agree on a financing and&#13;
savings plan, stating the financing deficit that will occur under the condition of an affordable debt&#13;
service. Borrowers will be handed HAF applications to submit together with the financing and savings&#13;
plan. HAF will then survey and prioritize applicants for a subsidy voucher.&#13;
15.    The first alternative will give the HAF considerable discretion about the selection of families.&#13;
The threshold needed for the household to approach HAF will be lowered, as no formal negotiation with&#13;
a bank is required in the initial stage of the process. However, eligibility requirements will have to&#13;
include the existence of savings/downpayments in a bank. Also, the application effort and costs for the&#13;
applicant will be high in dealing directly with the HAF as it has a limited infrastructure. Most&#13;
importantly, HAF cannot force banks to lend if the selected families are not acceptable credit risks.&#13;
16.    Pre-screening the application through participating banks will instead give a signal of principal&#13;
creditworthiness to the HAF that may be the only reliable way to select the target group. Banks will&#13;
receive an administrative fee for this duty. Not having selected beneficiaries according to a feasible&#13;
financing plan has been a serious shortcoming in previous housing projects in WBG, leading to an&#13;
undesirable high level of subsidies. Sharing the screening tasks with participating banks will also serve to&#13;
minimize HAF's administration. Banks will certainly do their own technical and financial examination of&#13;
the applicant's project, a service which will be very expensive for HAF to perform. HAF could thus&#13;
minimize its administrative functions. In the unlikely case of every single one of the participating banks&#13;
declining to develop a financing and savings plan with the applicant, it should be left open to the&#13;
borrower to appeal with HAF. The likelihood of such an event will be reduced by accordingly adjusting&#13;
the contract over SMF refinancing (e.g. condition of splitting between basket B and basket C).&#13;
17.    The RAF will organize its application procedures around four principal tasks: (1) setting&#13;
program eligibility guidelines and communicating them to participating families and banks; (2)&#13;
surveying, prioritizing, and selecting beneficiaries; (3) providing funds to selected beneficiaries on the&#13;
basis of a complete financing plan; and (4) monitoring beneficiaries to ascertain whether funds were&#13;
spent as intended. For these operations, HAF will have to coordinate with banks, as well as with central&#13;
and local government institutions.&#13;

18.   Setting Eligibility Guidelines. Eligibility criteria serve to effectively select the envisaged target&#13;
group while limiting the number of applications and the related administration costs for HAF. In order to&#13;
target the assistance in line with the objectives of the program:&#13;
a.    the standardizedfamily income level for assistance will be limited to $   . To facilitate&#13;
comparisons of affordability between families, a standard method is to deduct&#13;
consumption equivalents for each family member from the family income&#13;
(standardization). Consumption equivalents are calculated and updated by the Palestinian&#13;
Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) based on its on-going, 4,800 household&#13;
Consumption and Expenditure Survey. In the case of banks and HAF, standardization&#13;
will only require the number and age of family members as additional information to&#13;
income. The HAF will update information in cooperation-operation with the PCBS;&#13;
b.    the family shall not be homeowners already. As a default, it is assumed that nuclear&#13;
families living with their parents are not homeowners. Homeowning families living in an&#13;
overcrowded situation will be eligible as well, after a procedure of how to measure&#13;
overcrowding has been established. Housing quality will not be considered as a criterion,&#13;
as other programs available already address the issue of home improvements;&#13;
c.    the family should not have received other benefits from PA, or donors, over a specified&#13;
limit;&#13;
d.     being full aware of the constraints on measurement, the family should not possess&#13;
financial wealth over a limit of $   . Methods of measurement shall be developed over&#13;
time. Real wealth in the form of land should not be restricted, if the size does not exceed&#13;
the needed size for an single-family house;&#13;
e.     afinancing and savings plan for the targeted house price, including the envisaged&#13;
subsidy, shall be produced as an addendum to the HAF application. A technical&#13;
assistance program to train banks will be set up as a part of the initiative. In the initial&#13;
stage of the program, evidence of the complete downpayment (20-25%) will be required.&#13;
In the final stage, this will be replaced by a short-term savings plan over 9-15 months.&#13;
19.    Surveying, Prioritizing and Selecting Applicants. As a principle, prioritization and selection&#13;
should be done through an equitable, understandable system. This is necessary as available resources&#13;
have to be matched with demands. This queuing up of applicants does not entail a second selection&#13;
process. Before prioritization, eligible applicants are socially surveyed on a random basis (10-25% of&#13;
applications) by HAF social surveyors in order to counter fraudulent applications and update the&#13;
accuracy of the eligibility criteria/point system. No technical surveys will be undertaken by HAF, as&#13;
banks (with technical assistance from HAF) will take over this task as part of their normal mortgage&#13;
lending business.&#13;
20.    A point system can be used to prioritize potential beneficiaries. The point system must serve the&#13;
dual purposes of encouraging conformity with Housing Program goals and queuing up potential&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
a.     Social cases. These should be given a low weight in prioritization in order not to distort&#13;
the probability of a normal applicant being selected. Points will be given to handicapped&#13;
persons, families that suffered losses under Israeli occupation, and single parent families,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 8 of 14&#13;
Larger groups of social cases, as returning policemen, must be addressed under a special&#13;
programs.&#13;
b.     Overcrowding. Housing density will be evaluated by a persons-per-room figure of the&#13;
applying nuclear family. The number of nuclear families per household, being the main&#13;
incentive for a nuclear family to build its own dwelling, will be considered as well. For&#13;
both criteria, a simple documentation procedure, based on the forthcoming PCBS&#13;
housing census, and administered by municipalities will be developed.&#13;
c.     Standardizedfamily income. Will be given a low weight, reflecting the trade-off between&#13;
available funds and affordability.&#13;
d.     Savings and rent payments. Savings are weighted heavily in prioritization as they&#13;
demonstrate the ability of the applicant to achieve financial goals. Savings effort will be&#13;
measured in the final stage of HAF through three indicators:&#13;
*      Length of savings period: Beginning with application, 9-12 months, if savings&#13;
are larger than 20% of income. In the initial phase, because full downpayments&#13;
are required, the length of the savings period will be canceled as an item on the&#13;
point list.&#13;
*      Amount of savings: Any additional savings over the required minimum over the&#13;
established time period will yield additional points, up to a limit.&#13;
*      The amount of current housing expenditure establishes both a cost-push&#13;
motivation for building a family owned house and an indication of housing&#13;
related effort. The level of rent plus utility payments will be considered.&#13;
e.     Downpayment effort. The points will relate downpayments to income, as banks will&#13;
require an absolute minimum downpayment. The number of points here will be low for&#13;
the same reasons as income.&#13;
21.    The HAF will exist in order to assist households to purchase a residence. To do so will require a&#13;
combination of the grant, savings, and a loan. After prioritization, a final review of the financing plan&#13;
will be performed that decides the appropriation of the subsidy. If the downpayment is missing or&#13;
insufficient, the applicant is requeued for the next prioritization round. If no loan has been approved&#13;
despite the financing and savings plan, a negotiation process with the participating bank will be started.&#13;
In the initial stage of the program a central matter will be to develop a case-by-case settlement&#13;
mechanism in dispute cases.&#13;
22.   Disbursement. The actual provision of assistance can be through a voucher. A voucher is a&#13;
certificate reflecting contractual obligation of the HAF to pay a part of the purchase price of a residence.&#13;
As housing becomes available, vouchers can be awarded to those who have fully qualified for assistance,&#13;
which requires that they are high in the point system queue and have qualified for a loan. The voucher&#13;
can be delivered to the mortgage lender at settlement as a supplement to the participant's contribution to&#13;
the down payment. It can then be redeemed by the participating financial institution for cash with the&#13;
HAF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 9 of 14&#13;
23.   Follow-up. The final task will be to develop a system for enforcing HAF standards. Funds must&#13;
be used for the construction or purchase a qualified house. Beneficiaries should be expected to live in&#13;
their residences. Rules about selling a residence that has been subsidized have to be established; standard&#13;
rules existing in other countries prohibit sales within 3 to 10 years after purchase.&#13;
Sources of Funds&#13;
24.   The HAF will obtain its funds from donor grants or from concessional loans provided by donors.&#13;
In addition, the PA will contribute public land for the construction of low cost housing and, in the future,&#13;
budgetary resources to sustain the operation of the HAF. HAF funds can be channeled directly from&#13;
donors or through the Secondary Market Facility (SMF). To the extent that donor loans to the SMF are at&#13;
concessional (below-market) rates, the difference between the concessional rate and market rate can be&#13;
provided to the Housing Assistance Fund.&#13;
25.   Under the proposed structure of the subsidy scheme, an amount of $20 million can facilitate&#13;
home purchase by approximately 4,000 low-income households. The funds will be needed as qualifying&#13;
units are produced. Interest rate buydowns can serve to spread out a portion of the assistance payments&#13;
over the lives of the loans and can be combined with up-front grants.&#13;
Uses of Funds&#13;
26.   The HAF's role is to provide funding to help bridge the affordability gap for low- to moderate-&#13;
income households in WBG. The envisaged family income range to qualify for assistance is $350 to&#13;
$600 per month Without assistance, the small denomination mortgage for which such a household could&#13;
qualify will not enable it to purchase acceptable housing. The household will be expected to apply&#13;
approximately one year's income toward the down payment on a residence.&#13;
27.   The subsidy will be given to fund the deficit in the proposed financing plan, based on the&#13;
assumption of a house price of US$25,000. The deficit is calculated on the basis of a norm effort ratio,&#13;
which will vary to a limited extent with income (between 25%/$600 and 35%/$350) in order to stretch&#13;
donor funds. The contract between SMF and banks will be designed accordingly in order to cushion the&#13;
additional credit risk exposure of banks.&#13;
28.   In addition, the assistance grant will be capped at a level of US$6,000 in order to control the&#13;
subsidy-to-income relation, thereby minimizing disincentives to work and rent-seeking behavior. The&#13;
assistance has to be capped in the first stage of the program in order to reach as many households as&#13;
possible. A target is an average grant volume of under $5,000. For very low-income families the cap will&#13;
require a combination of additional debt service effort and more than one-year's income in&#13;
downpayments. This drawback trades off against a higher number of low-income families that can be&#13;
reached. This aspect is particularly important with regard to future financing of HAF from the PNA&#13;
budget. Table I shows how a median recipient household will finance a residence:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Grant                          $5,160           20.6%&#13;
29.   In this example, the median recipient household, assumed in the first stage to have a monthly&#13;
income of $500, purchases a $25,000 residence. If the borrower obtains a 15 year loan at 9 percent in&#13;
dollar terms and pays a maximum of 27.5% percent of income to service the mortgage, the monthly&#13;
payment would be $138. The maximum loan the borrower can obtain is $13,840. Thus, the household&#13;
would have to raise an additional $11,160 to purchase the house. This monthly payment may be feasible&#13;
for many households earning $500 per month, but the down payment of could be unreachable. To make&#13;
this purchase feasible for a household earning $500 per month, assistance with the down payment is&#13;
necessary. Assuming that the borrower has an initial downpayment upon HAF application of 10% of the&#13;
house price ($2,500) he would have to save 27.5 percent of his salary for two years, in order to&#13;
accumulate $6,000 towards the downpayment. The required assistance for this household to purchase the&#13;
residence would be $5,160.&#13;
30.   The relative proportions of loan, grant, and savings will depend on the income of the household.&#13;
Appendix 1 contains examples of the grant, loan, and savings amounts for households of differing&#13;
incomes in the program. A household choosing to buy a more expensive home will be expected to cover&#13;
the full incremental expense of the higher priced residence out of its own funds (savings). The results of&#13;
this analysis are shown in Figure 3. The following general principles are evident:&#13;
a.    As income increases, a beneficiary should provide more savings toward the down&#13;
payment;&#13;
b.    As income increases, a beneficiary should obtain a larger mortgage;&#13;
c.    As income increases, a beneficiary should receive less donor assistance;&#13;
d.    Regardless of income variation, subsidies should remain capped in order to stretch donor&#13;
funds, raise work incentives and reduce rent-seeking behavior.&#13;

31.    An equivalent amount of subsidy can be given either as a lump-sum subsidy; i.e., a once-and-for-&#13;
all payment that reduces the necessity for other financing sources such as loans, or as an interest buy-&#13;
down subsidy; i.e., a subsidization of current debt service payments. The advantages of a lump-sum&#13;
subsidy strategy are that:&#13;
a.    it alleviates the credit rationing problem of the borrower by reducing the loan volume&#13;
and thereby the loan-to-value level, which helps targeting low-income borrowers.&#13;
b.    it yields a financial return equal to the market loan interest rate as the loan is substituted.&#13;
c.    it is easy and inexpensive to administer.&#13;
32.    A disadvantage is that, given as cash subsidy, a lump-sum grant is difficult to recover in case of&#13;
fraud, i.e., the cost of monitoring is higher. The advantages of an interest buy-down are that:&#13;
a.    it allows control of the borrower, as subsidies can be withdrawn (relevant if the lump-&#13;
sum is a cash subsidy);&#13;
b.    it can mean a reduced subsidy if income growth is taken into consideration. It remains to&#13;
be seen whether HAF will be able to continuously review income under minimum&#13;
administrative costs.&#13;
33.    The disadvantages of interest buy-down include an inferior financial return as unused funds can&#13;
only be invested at deposit rates, i.e., the interest buy-down finances the spread of the banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 12 of 14&#13;
Furthermore, it will entail higher administrative costs. Ultimately, a buy-down strategy will require a&#13;
higher loan volume, with adverse effect on HAF's ability to target low-income families.&#13;
34.    Under the present high spreads of the banking system and the difficulties to monitor beneficiary&#13;
incomes, interest-buy-down is certainly an inferior financial strategy. However, the borrower's covenants&#13;
may be more effectively controlled than in the case of a lump-sum, where RAF might lose the whole&#13;
subsidy amount. Therefore, HAF, in cooperation with lenders, must vigorously control the borrower's&#13;
creditworthiness in a lump-sum procedure. Alternatively, HAF could finance a combination of a grace&#13;
period for capital repayments and lump-sum subsidies. This will lead to a deferment of scheduled&#13;
amortizations under the fixed-rate annuity and will allow for a better matching of lending and income&#13;
conditions.3&#13;
Organization&#13;
35.    The HAF will be a separate government entity under the supervision of the Ministry of Housing.&#13;
It will have a Director appointed by the Minister of Housing with complete responsibility for&#13;
administering the fund, screening and monitoring beneficiaries, and appropriating the assistance grants.&#13;
The proposed organization structure of the HAF is shown in Figure 4.&#13;
36.    There will be two main divisions of the RAF. The first, Social Affairs, will be in charge of&#13;
developing and administering eligibility guidelines and the point system for prioritization. As Figure 2&#13;
shows it organizes the entire application process and prepares the dossier for final decision making. In&#13;
addition, it will be responsible for cooperation with banks on all relevant issues. The Finance and&#13;
Operations division will be in charge of disbursing funds (both up-front grants and subsidy payments to&#13;
lenders in the case of interest rate buy-downs) and following up to determine that HAF funds were spent&#13;
properly. An important responsibility of the Operations division will be to develop a computer system to&#13;
track household eligibility and Fund disbursements. An External Auditor reporting to the Minister of&#13;
Housing, not displayed in this chart, will provide an independent review of how households are qualified&#13;
and funds are disbursed.&#13;
3 A well-known disadvantage of constant annuity loans, as a typical fixed-rate mortgage, is that under the&#13;
assumption of positive nominal income growth the effort ratio is highest in the beginning of the loan term. As&#13;
graduated payment mortgages will remain unavailable in WBG for the foreseeable future, introducing grace periods&#13;
for repayment could well reduce the maximum effort ratio, and hence will allow for a reduction of the lump-sum&#13;
subsidy.&#13;

37.    The organizational design of HAF is based on the idea of task-sharing with other public entities&#13;
and participating banks, as well as of administrative parsimony. HAF needs to concentrate scarce funds&#13;
on genuine social policy issues, such as design of program guidelines and priorities, social surveying,&#13;
review of applications, and administration of funds. HAF also needs pre-screening of applications by&#13;
participating banks in order to minimize its workload while maintaining a high level of control. The HAF&#13;
will therefore conduct its business only out of two central locations (Gaza City and a West Bank city).&#13;
Risk Mitigation&#13;
38.    There are three principal risks of HAF operation. The first is program risk is that funds are not&#13;
channeled to beneficiaries in accordance with the guidelines determined by the HAF. There may be&#13;
several sources of that risk, among other things:&#13;
a.     Mistargeting of families due to insufficient income documentation and lack of other&#13;
relevant information; and fraud.&#13;
b.     Political intervention in the beneficiary selection process due to a lack of independence&#13;
of HAF. Politically important groups or government employees could be given priority&#13;
over the normal applicant. Conversely, political intervention might lead to an exclusion&#13;
of camp dwellers from assistance.&#13;
39.    The second risk is the discomfort of the population with the initially reduced scope of HAF,&#13;
following the misperception of HAF as a comprehensive solution to Palestinian housing problems. HAF&#13;
can only be developed over time as donor funds are limited, and the scope of the program is to enable&#13;
mortgage lending; i.e., accessing the complete range of sources for housing finance. The potential&#13;
negative outcome of overstretched expectations commands a defensive communication policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 14 of 14&#13;
40.    The third risk is operations risk, meaning that the HAF has too high an operating cost ratio (i.e.,&#13;
too small a fraction of donor funds actually end up in the hands of beneficiaries) or that beneficiaries&#13;
misuse donor funds. It is up to the Director to ensure that the HAF runs efficiently. The role of the&#13;
External Auditor is to provide a check against program risk and the risk of funds misallocation.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
41.    The HAF can be an important component of the housing policy in WBG. Donor funds, when&#13;
available, can be channeled through the HAF directly to beneficiaries to assist them in their housing&#13;
purchases. Fundinig of the HAF can increase the effective demand for housing among low and moderate&#13;
income Palestinian households. By linking grants to savings the HAF can provide positive incentives for&#13;
funds accumulation and provide banks with a powerful signal about the creditworthiness of such&#13;
households.&#13;
42.    The HAF will become a reality as a result of the work of a preparation task force and as funding&#13;
is secured. The staff responsible for creation and administration of the HAF will develop statutes,&#13;
operations manual and job descriptions for the entity. The HAF will require the administrative&#13;
cooperation of other government entities. This cooperation will cover elaboration of a strategy together&#13;
with MOF to enhance permanently the share of employees with formal income documentation, in&#13;
particular througlh the handing out of income tax receipts to individual employees. Documentation on&#13;
noni-lhomeowniership and overcrowding will be required from municipalities. A formal work relations&#13;
with the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, including an exchange of information, and a regular&#13;
submission of statistical material and feedback on needs of the ministry is also required. Collection and&#13;
preparation of all statistical material that is relevant for the empirical quantification of target groups,&#13;
special social groups, etc. will be undertaken.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
Features of the Institutional and Policy Development Component&#13;
Building Normative and Regulatory Capacity for the Housing Sector&#13;
1.      There is no official regulatory structure for the housing sector. To facilitate the development of&#13;
appropriate policies, as well as a strong institutional framework to guide the sector, the project includes&#13;
funds (the Institutional and Policy Development Component) for a program to develop policy and&#13;
regulatory measures. This would help formulate key physical planning and regulatory instruments, would&#13;
permit the analysis and preparation of policy options and implementation of the regulatory instruments,&#13;
and would provide a sequence of initiatives to introduce appropriate standards with the institutions&#13;
(public, municipal, private and developers) involved in the housing sector.&#13;
2.      General sector policy as well as sector norms such as physical development standards and&#13;
development practices, either by the public or private sector is ad hoc, and based on imported (mostly&#13;
Jordanian and Egyptian) codes/models. At the outset, design standards, zoning and physical design codes&#13;
must be flexible and experimental in order to allow the proper testing of these concepts. This is&#13;
particularly key in the area of urbanization (land sub-division) design. Given land scarcity and high cost&#13;
layouts will need to be highly efficient with regard to land use densities, plot sizes, etc. to maximize the&#13;
use of costly and scarce land --one of the key future issues in Gaza and the West Bank&#13;
3.      The bulk of the capacity building work will be carried out as part of the project's&#13;
implementation. However the analysis and search for appropriate local standards has been initiated in the&#13;
project preparation stage. Because appropriate design standards for infrastructure, land subdivision,&#13;
circulation design, and housing construction is critical to least-cost housing production and future&#13;
infrastructure maintenance, a Standards Workshop was organized in Gaza during the project's&#13;
preparation to review issues and advance the preparation of standards. A draft paper on standards was&#13;
produced (listed in the project's files) and will be updated to serve as a guidelines for developers, the&#13;
MOH, and other normative institutions in establishing official development standards for Gaza and the&#13;
West Bank.&#13;
4.      The project will help develop of procedures for use by the MOH for resettlement and land&#13;
acquisition. The development of these procedures would be undertaken in coordination with&#13;
development of laws and regulations by the recently elected Palestinian Assembly. This process would&#13;
be complemented by project-supported training courses concerning environment, cultural heritage and&#13;
resettlement issues.&#13;
Building Capacity for the Housing Finance Institutions&#13;
5.      A critical element for the stability and health of the housing sector is a sustainable system of&#13;
finance both for buyers and suppliers. The project begins this process by establishing three institutions -&#13;
the SMF, MIF and HAF. The institutional strategy and specific implementation plan for each of these&#13;
institutions is discussed in the relevant section of this document. There are however associated policy&#13;
and institutional issues which need to be addressed for the whole system to mature and function in a&#13;
sustainable fashion. The main activities to accomplish would be:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
a.  a review of the legal and institutional framework for debt recovery in WBG. Since a&#13;
system of collateralized mortgage lending depends on the ability of the lender to&#13;
efficiently access the collateral this topic is at the core of building the housing finance&#13;
system. The review will assess the shortcomings of the present legal and institutional&#13;
frameworks, identify the main constraints and impediments facing creditors in WBG in&#13;
connection with the recovery of debt, especially those arising from the use of real estate&#13;
mortgages as collateral security, propose appropriate solutions to overcome such&#13;
constraints and impediments and provide detailed proposals, including justification, for&#13;
any new law or regulation, or amendment of any existing law or regulation, that may be&#13;
proposed.&#13;
b.  the commercial banks who will be the retail lenders to households will need to&#13;
considerably strengthen their capability to assess credit worthiness of households and to&#13;
process and manage this new type of financial product. An exercise to jointly assist all&#13;
banks joining in the housing finance scheme will be designed and implemented. Some&#13;
aspects of this program may be carried out in collaboration with other small scale credit&#13;
programs.&#13;
c.  the successful implementation of the Housing Assistance Fund depends upon&#13;
cooperation and close working relationships with a number of public and private bodies.&#13;
A program to develop the work-sharing arrangements will be implemented for statistical&#13;
agencies, local governments and participating commercial banks.&#13;
The Institutional and Policy Development Program (IPDP)&#13;
6.      The institutional and policy development measures would be carried out over the four-year&#13;
period as an organized and sequential program of capacity and policy enabling activities. Therefore a&#13;
four-year Institutional and Policy Development Program (IPDP), based on an initial needs assessment,&#13;
would be developed. An IPDP Steering Committee would be established to guide the program.&#13;
Objectives of the IPDP&#13;
7.      The general objective of the IPDP is supporting the long term development of the housing&#13;
sector through policy formulation and institutional development.&#13;
8.      The specific objectives are:&#13;
a.  to contribute to the physical and financial success of the "housing finance and&#13;
development" components, ensuring in the process that their expected demonstration&#13;
effect materializes;&#13;
b.  developing the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Housing, the private sector, and&#13;
local governments;&#13;
c.  developing key policy elements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
Priority Areas and Clients of the IPDP&#13;
9.      First, the IPDP is intended to build capacity of relevant institutions just by supporting the&#13;
process of inception and operation of the newly created institutions and/or units: the Project Unit (PU),&#13;
the Secondary Mortgage Facility (SMF), the Mortgage Insurance Fund (MIF), and the Housing&#13;
Assistance Fund (HAF). Also, the IPDP will help in assessing the performance and elaborating proposal&#13;
to ensure the sustainability of these same institutions. The IPDP will assign high priority to supporting&#13;
the definition, follow-up and revision of procedures for secondary mortgage operations, the extension of&#13;
risk protection against defaults, allocation of subsidies, and construction finance management&#13;
10.     The IPDP will also support the Ministry of Housing in the process of business planning, the&#13;
development of appropriate coordination mechanisms with other central and local government&#13;
institutions, and the operation of mechanism for policy consultation and consensus building. As part of&#13;
its work in the institutional area, the IPDP will work with the PU and other institutions of the housing&#13;
sector, including local governments, in identifying needs and delivering activities that increase their&#13;
administrative, managerial, and technical capacities. The IPDP will also support the Ministry of Planning&#13;
in its role of regulating and planning land utilization.&#13;
11.     Another area of priority for the IPDP is policy development. the focus will be on the regulatory&#13;
framework, property rights, title registration and procedures for transfer of titles; debt recovery, land&#13;
markets, provision and management of infrastructure and basic services; property taxation and user fees,&#13;
and the operation of the construction industry.&#13;
12.     One issue that needs special attention is that of developing the regulatory framework:&#13;
standards, codes, and regulations for land development, sub-division, infrastructure provision, housing&#13;
construction; and the construction industry. Existing practices in both Gaza and the West Bank, as well&#13;
as other international experiences require analysis, study, and debate. A system of registering the&#13;
experience and disseminating lessons from the Tal El-Hawa demonstration project will be put in place by&#13;
the program. A major output of the IPDP will be the preparation of options concerning the future&#13;
regulatory framework in Palestine, and alternative strategies for adopting the selected framework. Within&#13;
this area, the IPD component will support increased capacity for policy formulation as well as increased&#13;
capacity for policy management by MOH, and local governments. The application and supervision of&#13;
standards, codes and regulations is a local issue, involving municipalities.&#13;
13.     In spite of the financial strength and the experience in other types of operations, mortgage&#13;
financing is a new business area for the financial institutions currently operating in Palestine. In addition,&#13;
successful operation of the HAF, and MIF calls for support and technical assistance to private sector&#13;
financial institutions, expected to perform functions of risk analysis, and prescreening of low income&#13;
candidates needing special assistance from the HAF. The construction industry also requires support to&#13;
increase their volume of operations and increase their level of efficiency. The IPDP will contribute to the&#13;
development of the private sector, in both the financial and construction sector, by helping develop&#13;
procedures, administrative procedures, organizational arrangements, and the management skills required&#13;
by primary and secondary mortgage operations.&#13;
Operation of the IPDP&#13;
14.     The IPDP will operate under the guidance of a Steering Committee that will ensure that&#13;
activities respond to clients needs, and facilitate proper coordination with other projects and capacity&#13;
building initiatives. The PU Project Coordinator will be the Steering Committee's Secretary. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
Steering Committee will include a representative of the Ministries of Local Governments and Planning,&#13;
and individual Palestinian housing experts and/or practitioners.&#13;
15.     The Institutional and Policy Development Program will prepare an "annual plan of activities"&#13;
in a participatory manner. It is anticipated that the plan will be prepared during the project launch&#13;
workshop. In preparation for the workshop, "needs assessments" will be organized to identify problems,&#13;
needs, priorities, as perceived by the main clients.&#13;
16.     In parallel with the needs assessment and the preparation for the planning workshop, the IPDP&#13;
will begin working in a "core set of activities", whose design and implementation cannot be delayed. The&#13;
core set of activities responds to problems critical for the Palestinian Housing Initiative, the newly&#13;
created institutions, the demonstration project (Tal El-Awa), and/or the Ministry of Housing.&#13;
17.     Core activities will be selected from the following list prepared on the basis of discussions&#13;
during the project's preparation.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
1.      The project elements, their estimated costs, and the procurement arrangements for the&#13;
components to be financed by IDA are summarized in Table 1. A General Procurement Notice will be&#13;
published in the UN Development Business. With reference to the project components described in the&#13;
project description in Section 1.C., the procurement arrangements will be as follows:&#13;
a.     SMF mortgage financing made by the participating banks (typical maximum mortgage&#13;
will be about US$15,000, of which the SMF would match about US$10,000) will use&#13;
commercial practices and will not involve procurement procedures;&#13;
b.    construction finance loans (not likely to exceed US$400,000) will be awarded following&#13;
applications submitted to the PU of the MOH and channeled to commercial banks which&#13;
will act as agent; these operations will also follow commercial practices;&#13;
c.    infrastructure and facilities works for the demonstration sites and the off-sites&#13;
infrastructure and facilities will be administered by the PU of the MOH. These works are&#13;
many, widely dispersed geographically, and small scale, costing no more than US$2&#13;
million each. Procurement will be packaged and scheduled taking into account the nature&#13;
of the works, the stage of preparation, and the implementation capacity of local&#13;
contractors. Procurement will follow National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures&#13;
based on the pre-1967 procurement laws of Egypt (with some elements of the Palestine&#13;
Mandate Law and Israeli Civil Administration regulations ) and Jordan Law, which are&#13;
in force in Gaza and the West Bank, respectively. The procurement procedures described&#13;
by these laws are being followed by the MOH. These are satisfactory to IDA with the&#13;
following provisos: (i) tenders will be advertised for at least two consecutive days in a&#13;
local newspaper of wide circulation; (ii) prospective bidders will be allowed a minimum&#13;
of 30 days between the first appearance of notification and bid submission; (iii) bidding&#13;
documents will follow the forrnats of IDA's Standard Bidding Documents; (iv) if&#13;
interested, foreign bidders will be allowed to submit bids, and will not be required to&#13;
have local agents to be able to participate in bidding; (v) bids will be submitted in sealed&#13;
envelopes, and both mailed and hand-carried bids will be accepted; (vi) all bids will be&#13;
opened at the same time in public; (vii) contracts will be awarded to the lowest evaluated&#13;
bidder; (viii) bidders will not be asked, nor allowed, to change the substance of their bids&#13;
after the bid closing date, and price negotiations with the lowest evaluated bidder will be&#13;
confined to those cases listed in IDA's Procurement Guidelines; and (ix) in the absence&#13;
of prequalification, postqualification criteria will be explicitly stated in the bidding&#13;
documents;&#13;
d.    equipment supplies, vehicles and spares for the project, to be procured by the PU of the&#13;
MOH, will consist of small quantities of computer systems and peripherals, software,&#13;
simple telecommunications equipment, office equipment, books, training aids and other&#13;
related supplies. Vehicles will be needed by the PU for project management and site&#13;
supervision. Procurement will be in small packages likely to be won by agents or local&#13;
suppliers. Therefore, International Shopping (IS), with at least three quotations from two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
eligible countries, will be used for contracts estimated to cost less than US$250,000&#13;
each, and not to exceed US$1,000,000 in the aggregate, and Local Shopping (LS) with at&#13;
least three quotations, will be used for off-the-shelf, locally available items costing less&#13;
than US$25,000 per package and not to exceed US$500,000 in the aggregate. Direct&#13;
Contracting (DC) will also be allowed for items of a proprietary nature or requiring&#13;
compatibility with already installed equipment;&#13;
e.    the Institutional and Policy Development component will be administered by the PU of&#13;
the MOH and will include consultancy assignments for studies, technical assistance, and&#13;
training services to the MOH, banks and other agencies for housing and urbanization&#13;
policy studies and implementation advice, detailed technical aspects of off-site&#13;
infrastructure (water, wastewater, sanitation and roads), as well as assistance to the&#13;
MOH and the banks in dealing with the mechanisms of the participating commercial&#13;
banks. There are several local consultants and trainers (including the management and&#13;
engineering departments of the universities) with the requisite experience and&#13;
background which are likely to participate in the above mentioned assignments.&#13;
Consultants and trainers will be selected in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency&#13;
(August 1981), using IBRD's standardized Letter of Invitation (LOI) and Sample Form&#13;
of Contract for Consultants' Services;&#13;
f.    incremental operating expenditures will include MOH salaries, payments for office rents,&#13;
and bills for utilities and vehicle operating costs. These will be disbursed on a declining&#13;
basis during the four-year period of the project.&#13;
2.      In addition to its role in coordinating and monitoring all procurement activities of the&#13;
implementing agencies, and procuring items under paragraphs c), d), and e), above, the PU of the MOH&#13;
will (i) take actions required by the Grant Agreement's prior or post review provision, and (ii) maintain&#13;
records required for accountability in the use of the Grant funds. In addition, all civil works contracts&#13;
about US$250,000, all consultant appointments over US$]00,000 for consulting firms and US$50,000&#13;
for individuals, and the first two contracts of each implementing agency will be subject to prior review&#13;
by the IDA. These conditions are imposed due to the number and small size of contracts in\olved in the&#13;
project. All other contracts will also be subject to selective ex-post review by the IDA in order to cnsure&#13;
that IDA's Procurement Guidelines have been followed.&#13;

PALESTINIAN HOUSING INITIATIVE&#13;
Disbursement Schedule&#13;
1.    The project will be implemented over a four-year period from the estimated date of loan&#13;
effectiveness, with a completion target date of June, 2001. The commitment deadline for the credit line will&#13;
be April 30, 2001. The loan Closing Date will be December 31, 2001, six months after the project&#13;
completion date. The disbursement period of about 4 years or 16 quarters is short, but appropriate and is&#13;
deemed achievable because: (a) there are no complex, major civil works or equipment contracts; (b) the&#13;
institutional reforms should be completed within a planned four-year program; and (c) the subsidiary loans&#13;
(mortgages) and construction finance loans are small relative to anticipated demand.&#13;
2.    The proposed Bank credit will be disbursed against the project components as shown in TablelO.1&#13;
The projected disbursement profile for the Bank loan is shown in Figure 10.1. Disbursements for mortgages&#13;
of the SMF will be made against SOEs submitted by the SMF and participating banks evidencing that the&#13;
mortgages being refinanced are for new housing or for new renovations of existing housing. For this&#13;
purpose, participating banks will be required to separate out and certify to the SMF, those mortgages for&#13;
new or renovated housing that are included in the packages of mortgages that they submit to the SMF for&#13;
refinancing.&#13;

Supervision Plan and Project Implementation Schedule&#13;
1.  During the project implementation period, it is estimated that about 12 supervision missions will be&#13;
needed, with one large project inception mission initially to launch the project (a Project Lunch&#13;
workshop is planned). Total staffweeks for supervision is estimated to be on the order of 60 staffweeks&#13;
distributed among a project team (task manager; housing finance specialist; financial analyst; economist;&#13;
architect/urban planner; municipal engineer) and other specialists. Project supervision will be based on&#13;
an agreed set of project monitoring and development impact indicators. Bank field supervision inputs are&#13;
indicated in Table 12.1 below. These inputs are in addition to regular supervision needs at headquarters&#13;
for handling correspondence and reviewing/commenting on procurement actions, disbursement requests,&#13;
progress reports, annual audits, consultants' inception/draft final/final reports, etc., which are estimated&#13;
to require about 12 staffweeks in total, comprising about 7 staffweeks during the two first years of&#13;
project implementation and about 5 staffweeks during the remaining years. The other specialists&#13;
indicated in Table 12.1 who may participate in supervision missions could include a mortgage market&#13;
specialist, a financial markets specialist, and an institutional development/training specialist. This level&#13;
of supervision inputs is considered necessary because of the expected complexities associated with the&#13;
start-up and operations of the SMF, and also by the importance of close collaboration with the&#13;
Government and MOH in the implementation of the institutional and policy development component.&#13;

HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis of Housing Finance Institutions&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The project envisions the creation of two specialized Housing Finance institutions to provide&#13;
long-term funds and reallocate a portion of mortgage risk for providers of housing finance in West Bank&#13;
and Gaza (WBG). The entities are a secondary mortgage facility (SMF) that will provide long term&#13;
finance to banks and other lenders originating mortgage loans in WBG, and a mortgage indemnity fund&#13;
(MIF)l that will provide partial default risk insurance for lenders.&#13;
2.     The SMF will provide liquidity and long-term finance to primary mortgage lenders in order to&#13;
reduce the liquidity risk incurred in their provision of long term loans for housing. The activities of the&#13;
SMF will stimulate a flow of funds to housing, improve the affordability of housing finance in WBG and&#13;
reduce the liquidity risk of the banking sector.&#13;
3.     The MIF will share potential default loss on residential mortgage loans with lenders in WBG.&#13;
The MIF should stimulate greater lending for housing in WBG by providing lenders with partial&#13;
protection against mortgage default loss. The activities of the MIF will stimulate a flow of funds to&#13;
housing, the development of mortgage credit risk management skills and techniques and in the future&#13;
allow for a degree of pooling of credit risk among lenders.&#13;
4.     Household borrowers will benefit through the ability to use mortgage credit to purchase housing&#13;
and through more favorable terms on mortgage loans. Lenders will benefit through higher portfolio&#13;
returns and diversification. An increased flow of funds to housing may increase employment in the&#13;
construction industry and promote stability in the economy. A future benefit of the SMF may be to&#13;
enhance the development of long term debt markets.&#13;
Anticipated Benefits of the SMF&#13;
5.     There is virtually no formal financial sector lending for housing in WBG. Banks operating in the&#13;
region cite two major reasons for the lack of such lending; the high perceived liquidity risk of extending&#13;
long term loans in a volatile climate and the high perceived credit risk of extending long term loans in an&#13;
environment with uncertain property rights and lack of information about or experience with potential&#13;
mortgage borrowers.&#13;
6.     The liquidity risk of mortgage lending arises from the fact that in order to be affordable and&#13;
match the anticipated benefit stream of housing, mortgage loans must be relatively long-term (e.g., 15 or&#13;
more years). The banks currently fund themselves with a mix of short-term deposits (approximately&#13;
95%) and equity (approximately 5%). They are reluctant to provide mortgage loans funded with deposits&#13;
because they perceive a significant risk that instability in WBG could lead to a substantial outflow of&#13;
deposits. If a substantial portion of their assets are in the form of long-term loans, they may have&#13;
insufficient funds available to meet depositors' demands. Although shareholder equity is a longer-term&#13;
source of funds, the banks are unwilling to invest such funds in an activity that they believe offer a low&#13;
risk-adjusted rate of return.&#13;
I/ Initially the MIF will be introduced as a separate account within the SMF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
7.      The benefits of the SMF for lenders arise from  the reduction in liquidity risk for mortgage&#13;
lending. If a bank uses SMF loans to finance a portion of its mortgage portfolio, it can achieve a duration&#13;
match between its mortgage assets and liabilities. Furthermore, if the SMF is perceived to be a source of&#13;
liquidity (i.e., a lender of first resort) the banks may be more likely to extend mortgage loans funded by&#13;
deposits. Banks offering mortgage loans may be able to earn a higher risk-adjusted rate of return on their&#13;
asset portfolios (i.e., arising from  switching from  other assets to mortgage loans) and provide a more&#13;
compete range of services to their customers.2&#13;
8.      The benefits for household borrowers arise from the availability of mortgage loans. The value to&#13;
consumers currently depends on their ability and willingness to borrow for the purchase of a home. As&#13;
there is no mortgage lending in WBG, it is impossible to formulate the willingness to pay for home&#13;
mortgage loans. For some households, the benefit will be the substitution of lower cost debt for equity&#13;
finance. However, we have no information on the investment choices or returns on Palestinian&#13;
households. For other households with no savings, the value of the loans will be in the form of access to&#13;
higher quality housing. Presumably this could be measured by the difference in the housing consumption&#13;
before and after receiving the loan. This is also very difficult to measure as many households share space&#13;
and expenditure with extended family members. Over time, as more lenders enter the market, borrowers&#13;
should also benefit from competition among lenders in the form of more favorable mortgage loan terms&#13;
(lower cost of funds and a longer term on loans being offered).&#13;
9.      In addition to the benefits for lenders and households, there are also potentially significant&#13;
external benefits generated by the SMF. An increase in housing demand spurred by mortgage lending&#13;
can lead to expanded employment in the construction industry. This benefit may be substantial given the&#13;
high rates of unemployment in WBG. Developing a private sector housing finance system will take the&#13;
pressure off the PA to develop its own sources of housing finance, resulting in a greater ability to focus&#13;
scarce subsidy resources on lower income households. A steady supply of mortgage finance could lead to&#13;
increased stability in WBG if housing overcrowding is reduced. Finally, the SMF could be a catalyst for&#13;
bond market development in the future.&#13;
10.     Lenders in WBG  also view  mortgage lending as a business with potentially high credit risk.&#13;
There are several reasons for this perception. First, most Palestinians have been without banking services&#13;
for over 25 years. Thus, they have no track record of having serviced and repaid debt, and no customer&#13;
history that banks can draw on to assess ability or willingness to pay. Second, the legal system&#13;
supporting mortgage lending is untested. Although the legal basis for property ownership, mortgage and&#13;
foreclosure exists, the property registries are incomplete (many transactions are not consummated with a&#13;
definitive transfer of title) and the ability of the court system to have claims enforced against owners is&#13;
unknown. A third factor is the political instability in the area. Both the West Bank and Gaza are subject&#13;
to frequent border closings that disrupt the income earning ability of residents.&#13;
11.     The high perceived level of credit risk is at least a strong deterrent to mortgage lending as the&#13;
high perceived level of liquidity risk. Thus, term loans from the SMF are currently perceived as&#13;
insufficient to stimulate mortgage lending in WBG. The MIF provides additional risk reduction to&#13;
2/  It is envisioned that the initial loans from the SMF, made with donor funds to selected banks, will specify the terms and conditions of the&#13;
mortgage loans made by the banks to ensure that the benefits of both the credit and liquidity risk reduction are passed on to borrowers. A&#13;
related benefit to the banks is the reduction of political risk. Currently, they are facing significant pressure from the govemment to expand&#13;
their lending in WBG, particularly in the area of housing. By agreeing to the terms and conditions of SMF loans, the banks may reduce&#13;
the risk of regulations requiring them to provide a certain amount of mortgage loans, at terms and conditions specified by the govemment.&#13;
3/  Mortgage loans are available, in limited supply, in Jordan. The economic analysis of the proposed SMF in Jordan valued the ability of&#13;
constrained Jordanian households to expand their loan-to-value ratios by 20 percentage points (e.g., from 50 to 70 percent) at 50 basis&#13;
points. This estimate is likely to significantly understate the value to Palestinian households who currently have no access to mortgage&#13;
finance. Reference&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
participating lenders in the form of a default risk sharing arrangement. The benefits of the MIF are&#13;
conceptually the same as those of the SMF. Lenders will benefit if the risk adjusted returns on mortgage&#13;
lending are higher than their investment alternatives and borrowers will benefit through the availability&#13;
and eventually through reductions in the cost of mortgage finance. The MIF may be a catalyst for the&#13;
introduction of mortgage credit risk underwriting and management techniques and in the future facilitate&#13;
the pooling of credit risk among lenders.&#13;
Costs of Intermediation&#13;
12.    The SMF's and MIF's costs of operation must be accounted for in determining net social&#13;
benefits. The costs of operation are difficult to estimate with certainty as both organizations will be new&#13;
with uncertain volumes of activity. Unlike the Jordanian SMF, the Palestinian SMF would incur no&#13;
expenses to issue bonds in its early years. Thus, its operating expenses should be lower (approximately&#13;
100 basis points per annum in years 3 through 5).&#13;
Net Social Benefits&#13;
13.    Because the benefits are so difficult to quantify for this project, the net social benefit of the SMF&#13;
and MIF are almost impossible to determine. However, it is almost unquestionably large in WBG. The&#13;
housing needs of Palestinian households are enormous with ample evidence of overcrowding. The&#13;
preference for homeownership in the Palestinian culture is also quite high. The political pressure to&#13;
stimulate affordable housing development in WBG is substantial.&#13;
14.    The only feasible way to provide resources for housing is by mobilizing the savings of&#13;
Palestinians, through the financial system and abroad. The most effective way to do so is through the&#13;
banking system, which has achieved remarkable results in acquiring deposits in recent months. The&#13;
activities of the SMF and MIF will get the banks to enter this business with the thought that as political&#13;
stability is established, the carrot of donor funds for refinance and loss sharing can be reduced with the&#13;
banks accepting more of the responsibility on their own. The ultimate objective is the creation of a&#13;
sustainable housing finance system, an integral part of the financial system of all modem economies.&#13;

HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
Environment, Cultural Heritage and Resettlement Aspects&#13;
Overview&#13;
1.    Objective. The objective of the Project is to support the Palestinian Authority (PA), working&#13;
through the Ministry of Housing (MOH), in removing obstacles in the production and purchase of low-&#13;
cost housing for low- and middle-income Palestinian households. To accomplish this the Project seeks to&#13;
stimulate and guide investment for low-cost housing by making land and infrastructure available, finding&#13;
ways to make the housing affordable, providing financing for buyers and developers and to make it&#13;
worthwhile for private developers to produce appropriate housing for these households. Two ways to&#13;
make housing affordable are by reducing total development coats and by packaging financial resources&#13;
for the buyers, such as financing and access to the Housing Assistance Program which will provide&#13;
support to targeted households. Preparation of the Project has included the integration of measures to&#13;
address environment, cultural heritage and resettlement issues under investment and institutional&#13;
strengthening activities.&#13;
2.    Preparation Process. A series of International Development Agency (IDA) missions prepared the&#13;
Project during late 1995 and early 1996. These missions included the participation of a World Bank&#13;
environmental specialist who worked with representatives of the MOH in the review of potential&#13;
environment, cultural heritage and resettlement issues associated with the Project. MOH and World&#13;
Bank/IDA staff conducted field visits to Tal El-Hawa and El Atatra to assess environment, cultural heritage&#13;
and resettlement issues associated with the proposed use of these sites under the Housing Development&#13;
Component as demonstration areas. Consultations were conducted with representatives of the&#13;
Environmental Planning Directorate (EPD) of the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, the&#13;
Palestinian Department of Archaeology (PDA) of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and the Ministry&#13;
of Culture (MOC) to review current and proposed Palestinian Authority policies and procedures with regard&#13;
to environment and cultural heritage. Current land acquisition procedures were also reviewed with&#13;
representatives of the MOH.&#13;
Applicable Environmental Procedures and Review Process&#13;
3.    Applicability of Environmental Procedures. The following environmental procedures will apply to&#13;
the review and implementation of the proposed project: (a) World Bank/IDA procedures concerning&#13;
environment, resettlement and cultural heritage as outlined in Operational Directive, 4.01, "Environmental&#13;
Assessment; Operational Directive, 4.30 "Involuntary Resettlement; and the guidance of the Environmental&#13;
Assessment Sourcebook and it's Updates, especially Update No. 8, "Cultural Heritage in Environmental&#13;
Assessment;" (b) for Gaza, the pre-1967 legislation of the Government of Egypt concerning water quality&#13;
inspections by health authorities and the protection of antiquities and historical monuments; and (c) for the&#13;
West Bank, the pre-1967 legislation of the Government of Jordan concerning water quality inspections by&#13;
health authorities and provisions for protection of antiquities and historical monuments.&#13;
4.    Development of New Procedures. The procedures of Egypt and Jordan will be phased out of use&#13;
as environmental procedures and guidelines are developed and issued for use by the Palestinian Authority.&#13;
The development of new environmental legislation and procedures, including environmental standards and&#13;
environmental assessment guidelines for use by the Palestinian Authority, is currently being undertaken by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
the EPD. The PDA and the MOC are developing complementary legislation and procedures for the&#13;
conservation of cultural heritage. The Bank supported Technical Trust Fund (TATF) and a number of&#13;
donors are supporting these activities.&#13;
5.     Applicability of Other Directives. A review was conducted concerning the possible application of&#13;
Operational Directive, 4.30, "Involuntary Resettlement" to activities to be supported under the proposed&#13;
project. At present, there are no sub-project proposals whose implementation is anticipated to result in&#13;
involuntary resettlement; however, a number of activities could require purchase by local authorities of&#13;
privately-held land from its owners or compensation of parties with informal use rights for agricultural or&#13;
other purposes. No known archaeological or historical sites are anticipated to affected by activities to be&#13;
supported under the proposed project due to site specific review by PDA. However, given the high density&#13;
of archaeological and historical sites in the West Bank and Gaza, provisions will be made in construction&#13;
contracts for the use of "chance find" procedures should archaeological or historical materials be discovered&#13;
in the course of project implementation.&#13;
6.     Activity Review Process. The primary instruments to address environmental and cultural heritage&#13;
aspects of the type of small-scale investments to be supported under the Project are the effective use of&#13;
planning, zoning and environmental and cultural heritage regulations in the review and permitting process&#13;
used for activities supported under the Project. IDA environmental assessment procedures will be used for&#13;
the review process until the Palestinian environmental assessment procedures are available for use, at which&#13;
time both sets of procedures will be in effect for project activities. Proposed activities to be supported under&#13;
the Housing Development Component of the Project will be subject to an environmental review process&#13;
which will be coordinated by the environmental specialist assigned to the MOH in cooperation with&#13;
representatives of EPD, PDA and MOC. To facilitate effective coordination with EPD, PDA and MOC&#13;
direct contacts will be established with their representatives based in Ramallah for the West Bank and Gaza&#13;
City for Gaza.&#13;
Environmental Screening of Project Components&#13;
7.     Environmental Screening Category. The Components of the Project have been reviewed&#13;
consistent with the provisions of Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment." The activities to&#13;
be included in the proposed project have been placed in the following environmental screening categories:&#13;
a.   Institutional and Policy Development Component (Category C). The Component will support a&#13;
four year program of policy and institutional building measures. This wili promote the&#13;
formulation of key physical planning and regulatory instruments, permit the analysis and&#13;
preparation of policy options, and provide a sequence of capacity building measures to help the&#13;
newly forming public and private sector institutions involved in the housing sector. This&#13;
component has been placed in category "C" as the activities will not result in adverse&#13;
environmental impacts.&#13;
The Component will include activities to assist development of low-income housing in a manner&#13;
which is environmentally sound, minimizes adverse impacts to cultural heritage and addresses the&#13;
concerns of parties which may be subject to involuntary resettlement or face the loss of informal&#13;
land use rights. It will support the development of procedures for use by the MOH for involuntary&#13;
resettlement and land acquisition. Under the Project a series of short-termn training courses will be&#13;
conducted for MOH and other parties conceming the management of environmental, cultural&#13;
heritage and resettlement issues in the Housing sector. These courses will make use of the&#13;
&#13;

recently completed Arabic translation of the Environmental Assessment Sourcebook and related&#13;
materials concerning environment, cultural heritage and resettlement.&#13;
b.   Housing Finance Component (Category C). The Component will support: (i) Secondary&#13;
Mortgage Facility (SMF); (ii) Mortgage Insurance Fund (MIF); and (iii) Housing Assistance&#13;
Fund (HAF). The SMF will provide long-term, market rate loans to the Housing Bank and&#13;
commercial banks to refinance their mortgage loans and the Mortgage Insurance Fund (MIF) will&#13;
provide limited credit risk insurance to mortgage lenders in the West Bank and Gaza. The&#13;
Housing Assistance Fund (HAF) will provide subsidies to qualified low-income households to&#13;
improve their ability to purchase or upgrade adequate shelter. The assistance will be in the form&#13;
of grants to eligible households to assist in the downpayment for modest-cost housing to lower&#13;
the loan repayment burden. This component has been placed in category "C" as the SMF, MIF&#13;
and HAF will not result in adverse environmental impacts.&#13;
c.   Housing Development (Category B). The Component will support the MOH to encourage the&#13;
private sector to produce lower-cost housing through: (i) development of off-site infrastructure on&#13;
State-owned lands on which private sector developers could bid for the production of qualifying&#13;
housing units; (ii) qualifying private lands with apartments and/or single family houses proposed&#13;
and produced by private developers; and (iii) single plots of private land for either single-family&#13;
houses or low-rise condominium apartments or cooperatives. These housing units will be&#13;
provided with infrastructure services for water supply, sewage, solid waste and stormwater&#13;
drainage. The use of improved layouts will allow for high density housing and more efficient use&#13;
of scarce land.&#13;
This component has been placed in environmental screening category "B" due to its limited&#13;
scope and the restricted nature of its potential impacts; all sub-projects under the Component will&#13;
be subject to screening for potential environmental impacts, cultural heritage concerns and&#13;
resettlement issues. All use of State-owned lands and development of private land will require&#13;
formal review and clearance procedures in consultation with the environmental staff of the&#13;
Resident Mission. Implementation of mitigation actions resulting from these reviews will be&#13;
monitored by the MOH and reviewed as part of Bank supervision for the project. Issues at the&#13;
proposed demonstration site at Tal El-Hawa in Gaza is reviewed in Attachment A.&#13;
8.     Special Issue - Construction Materials Industry. Implementation of the Project will require the&#13;
extensive use of local construction materials. Currently in both the West Bank and Gaza the illegal&#13;
quarrying of rock, gravel and sand is a serious problem which is resulting in serious damage to public and&#13;
private property. The illegal removal of massive quantities of sand in Gaza has been identified by the EPD&#13;
as a major environmental management problem in coastal and inland sites. The PDA has also identified&#13;
these operations as a major cause of destruction, especially in Gaza, of antiquities. In addition, inadequately&#13;
supervised rock, gravel and sand operations could result in locally significant air pollution from dust, water&#13;
pollution from improper disposal of lubricants from heavy equipment, and localized flooding during storms&#13;
due to the transport of poorly controlled sediment from excavation sites into surface drainage features.&#13;
While the proposed project will not directly fund these operations, measures will be taken with local&#13;
authorities and contractors to attempt to minimize these problems. To support this objective, measures will&#13;
be adopted under the Project to assure that, to the extent possible under local conditions, that construction&#13;
materials used are being collected from authorized sites.&#13;

Review of the Housing Development Component&#13;
9.     Main Issues. Development of affordable housing in the West Bank and Gaza is critical for the&#13;
long-term development of these areas and for the improvement of living conditions, including&#13;
environmental health. Large numbers of Palestinians are living in inadequate shelter which often has no&#13;
direct access to reliable water supply, no or inadequate connection with the sewage system and generally&#13;
unacceptable solid waste management. At the same time due to the extremely high density of population in&#13;
Gaza, the critical need to protect already seriously degraded environmental values, especially critical&#13;
groundwater supplies; and the need to maintain a rich cultural heritage the development of housing must be&#13;
undertaken in a manner which effectively integrates environment, cultural and resettlement issues.&#13;
10.    HDC Design Approaches and Review Procedures. The Housing Development Component&#13;
(HDC), has adopted a series of design approaches and review procedures to address environmental, cultural&#13;
heritage and resettlement aspects of housing development. The approaches adopted for the HDC are&#13;
consistent with the policies and objectives of the concemed agencies of the PA. These procedures have been&#13;
incorporated into the Prospectus for Investors for public land and private land which will be used by the&#13;
MOH to give guidance to private sector developers participating in the Project.&#13;
Il.    Design Approaches. The design approaches used in the HDC will focus on the cost-effective&#13;
development of land parcels suitable for development of housing by the private sector. These sites will be&#13;
required to be consistent with the general zoning provisions and to have proper access to water supply,&#13;
connections to the sewage system, provision for solid waste storage and collection and proper designs for&#13;
the management of stormwater. The HDC will also assist in the use of innovate lay-out and design&#13;
approaches which will allow for the more effective use of limited land while providing for safer and more&#13;
accessible public areas for use by extended families and neighbors. These layout innovations will reduce the&#13;
current tendency toward urban sprawl in the West Bank and Gaza.&#13;
12.    Overview of Review Procedures. In order to integrate environment, cultural heritage and&#13;
resettlement issues into the normal review and approval process for proposed activities under the HDC, the&#13;
following procedures will be used:&#13;
a.   State Owned Lands. The MOH will obtain for activities to be undertaken on state lands&#13;
formal clearances from the EPD and PDA on environment and cultural heritage issues prior&#13;
to making these plots available to the developers. The MOH will also obtain formal&#13;
clearances from the Ministry of Culture for any proposed actions on state lands which&#13;
involve the modification and/or demolition of historical structures which are 50 years or&#13;
older. The MOH will also conduct a site visit to determine if the proposed development&#13;
would require the involuntary resettlement of parties with either formal or informal land use&#13;
rights. The MOH will take measures, in coordination with the Resident Mission, to assure&#13;
that these are resolved in a manner consistent with World Bank/IDA Operational Directive&#13;
4.30, "Involuntary Resettlement." The relocation of any graves will be done in consultation&#13;
with religious authorities and the Resident Mission.&#13;
b.   Privately Owned Lands. In the case of activities to be undertaken on private lands, the MOH&#13;
will certify that the developer had obtained formal clearances from the EPD and PDA. The&#13;
MOH will also certify that any proposed actions involving the modification and/or&#13;
demolition of historical structures, 50 years or older, had obtained a formal clearance from&#13;
the Ministry of Culture. The MOH will also conduct a site visit to determine if the proposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 5 of 12&#13;
development would require the involuntary resettlement of parties with either fornal or&#13;
informal land use rights. The MOH will take measures, in coordination with the Resident&#13;
Mission, to assure that these are resolved in a manner consistent with World Bank/IDA&#13;
Operational Directive 4.30, "Involuntary Resettlement." The relocation of any graves will be&#13;
done in consultation with religious authorities and the Resident Mission.&#13;
Specific information on the required review procedures is provided Paras. 13-19 (below).&#13;
13.    Consultation with Physical Planning Department. Consultations will be conducted with the&#13;
Physical Planning Department of the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation to assure the&#13;
proposed actions are consistent with the principles of the Physical Master Plans for the West Bank and Gaza&#13;
Strip and special physical master plans which are being developed for Jericho, Ramallah and Gaza City&#13;
among others. The findings of this consultation will be provided as an element of the approval package for&#13;
the proposed activity.&#13;
14.    Consultation with Municipality. Consultations will be conducted with the Planning Department&#13;
and Infrastructure Departments of the concerned Municipal Government. These consultations will include&#13;
review and formal clearance of the proposed site with regard to zoning. The consultation will also include a&#13;
review of current and required access to municipal infrastructure services including water supply, sewage&#13;
systems, solid waste collection and storm water management. The municipality, MOH and private sector&#13;
developer will be required to reach an agreement on the services to be provided, which parties will be&#13;
responsible for their funding and installation, and the timing of the installation of these services. The&#13;
findings of this consultation will be provided as an element of the approval package for the proposed&#13;
activity.&#13;
15.    Environmental Review and Clearance. The Environmental Planning Directorate of the Ministry&#13;
of Planning and Intemational Cooperation should be contacted and requested to conduct an environmental&#13;
review of proposed Project activities to be undertaken to assure they are consistent with current Palestinian&#13;
requirements. The preparation of these reviews may require a field visit by representatives of the&#13;
Environmental Planning Directorate to the concerned sites. It is requested that a formal record of these&#13;
reviews concerning the acceptability of the proposed activities be obtained from the Environmental&#13;
Planning Directorate and made part of the review process and project record.&#13;
16.    Archaeological Review and Clearance. The Palestinian Department of Archaeology of the&#13;
Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities will be contacted and requested to conduct an archaeological and&#13;
historical sites review at each site proposed for support under the HDC. It should be anticipated that this&#13;
will require a preliminary field survey to be conducted by archaeologists acceptable to the Palestinian&#13;
Department of Archaeology. A formal record of these reviews concerning the acceptability of the proposed&#13;
activities be obtained from the Palestinian Department of Archaeology. In addition, all contractors retained&#13;
by the MOH and private sector developers will be required to used "archaeological chance find procedures"&#13;
given the potential for unknown archaeological materials to be uncovered at sites in the West Bank and&#13;
Gaza.&#13;
17.    Historical Buildings Review and Clearance. The Ministry of Culture will be contacted and&#13;
requested to conduct an on site review of any proposed activity under the HDC involving the modification&#13;
and/or demolition of any historic buildings over 50 year old. A formal record of these reviews conceming&#13;
the acceptability of the proposed activities be obtained from the Ministry of Culture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 6 of 12&#13;
18.    Relocation of Graves. Religious authorities and the relatives of the buried persons will be formally&#13;
consulted prior to the relocation of any graves. A formal record of these consultations and the decision of&#13;
the religious authorities will be provided to the MOH and Resident Mission for review and approval prior to&#13;
the relocation of graves. Design measures will be used to the fullest extent possible to avoid the relocation&#13;
of graves under the HDC.&#13;
19.    Resettlement, Land Acquisition and Compensation Issues. The evolving status of the&#13;
Palestinian administrative procedures and determination of lines of authority, including operational&#13;
differences between West Bank and Gaza, requires that proposed activities under the HDC be reviewed for&#13;
resettlement aspects by the MOH on an individual basis, with the close supervision of the Resident Mission&#13;
and support of EMTEN. This will involve site specific reviews and preparation of proposed compensation&#13;
packages which will require Bank review and approval. A condition of the loan will be that the Palestinian&#13;
Authority, acting through the MOH, will agree to use the following review process for activities to be&#13;
supported under the Housing Development Component of the proposed Project:&#13;
a.  Legal Status of the Proposed Site. Information will be provided on the official land ownership&#13;
status of each proposed site. This review will identify any outstanding claims or disputes&#13;
concerning title to all or any portion of the site.&#13;
b.  Survey of Current Land Use on the Site. A map should be prepared for each site which shows&#13;
the current land use, including both authorized and unauthorized activities. This will identify&#13;
areas which are being used for informal housing or have structures, locations of agricultural&#13;
activities, sand or rock excavation, waste disposal sites, and other uses.&#13;
c.  Identification of Formal and Informal Users. A list will be made, keyed to the map, which&#13;
will identify to the fullest extent possible the names of the formal and informal users and&#13;
provide information on the basis for their land use activities on the sites. To the extent they are&#13;
available, information or copies of leases or other authorizations for agriculture or other&#13;
activities will be collected. Under the provisions of World Bank/IDA resettlement procedures,&#13;
compensation may be required for parties with informal rights as well as for those with formal&#13;
rights.&#13;
d.  Consultation with Formal and Informal Users. In the development of sites larger than 20&#13;
dunums in area, the MOH will organize a public consultation process with formal and&#13;
informal users of the proposed site. This consultation will include a review of the proposed&#13;
activity, the rights of the affected parties, and the procedures to be used for compensation. The&#13;
process will provide for an opportunity for potentially affected parties to express their views&#13;
and preferences with regard to compensation. A record will be made of these consultations by&#13;
MOH which will be maintained in the Project files and provided to the Resident Mission.&#13;
e.  Estimation of Potential Compensation for Formal and Informal Users. Preliminary&#13;
information should be prepared concerning proposed costs of compensation for parties with&#13;
either formal or informal land use rights. A review will be prepared which will provide&#13;
information on the value and replacement costs of structures, outbuildings, fences, vines, trees&#13;
and other non-moveable assets. Preference will be given to the provision of altemate housing&#13;
for parties subject to involuntary resettlement and all compensation will be based on real&#13;
market rates which reflect real market value and replacement costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 7 of 12&#13;
f.   Review of Proposed Compensation and Payment. Given the wide variations in costs&#13;
between the different sections of the West Bank and Gaza, determinations for all proposed&#13;
compensation packages, including the provision of alternative housing, will be made on a&#13;
case-by-case basis in consultation with the MOH, municipal government, and affected&#13;
parties. In addition, the payments will be made in a transparent and public manner in which&#13;
the affected parties receive payment in a public location with a public notice being given of&#13;
the compensation and the individual who received the award. All proposed compensation&#13;
activities will be formally reviewed and approved by the Resident Mission with the support&#13;
of EMTEN as required.&#13;
20.    Review of Proposed Demonstration Site in Gaza. A review of environment, cultural heritage and&#13;
resettlement issues at the proposed Tal al Hawa demonstration site in Gaza is provided as Attachment A.&#13;
This site has been subject to a field survey by representatives of MOH and IDA which has confirmed that it&#13;
does have any known formal or informal housing which would require involuntary resettlement.&#13;
Development of Palestinian Resettlement Procedures&#13;
21.    Under the Institutional and Policy Development Component of the Project support will be provided&#13;
for the development of procedures for use by the MOH for involuntary resettlement and land acquisition.&#13;
The development of these procedures be undertaken in coordination with development of laws and&#13;
regulations by the recently elected Palestinian Assembly. This process will be complemented by Project&#13;
supported training courses concerning environment, cultural heritage and resettlement issues.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
22.   In order to support effective implementation of the Project, as an element of the Institutional and&#13;
Policy Development Component, a series of short training courses on environment, cultural heritage, and&#13;
resettlement issues related to the HDC will be conducted for public and private interests in cooperation with&#13;
EPD, PDA and MOC. These courses will be conducted in Arabic and make use of the recently completed&#13;
translations of relevant Operational Directives, the Environmental Assessment Sourcebook (3 volumes) and&#13;
selected updates to the Sourcebook, including procedures concerning cultural heritage. Additional materials&#13;
will be prepared in Arabic concerning resettlement and land acquisition issues.&#13;
Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
23.    Monitoring of the implementation of environment, cultural heritage and resettlement aspects of the&#13;
Project will be conducted by the MOH with the support of the Resident Mission. These issues will be&#13;
elements of the routine supervision missions to be conducted for the Project and IDA staff andlor&#13;
consultants with expertise in environment and resettlement issues will participate as members of the&#13;
supervision missions. EMTEN will provide specialized support to the Resident Mission, as required, in&#13;
undertaking monitoring and supervision activities.&#13;

HOUSING PROJECT&#13;
Housing Development Component&#13;
Tal El-Hawa Demonstration Site&#13;
Environment, Cultural Heritage And Resettlement Review&#13;
Overview&#13;
1.    Introduction. Under the Housing Development Component (HDC) of the Palestinian Housing&#13;
Project (Project) it is proposed to implement a demonstration activity at Tal El-Hawa in Gaza Municipality.&#13;
Consistent with procedures adopted by the Ministry of Housing (MOH) of the Palestinian Authority and the&#13;
International Development Association (IDA) this site has been the subject of field based reviews of&#13;
environment, cultural heritage and resettlement issues.&#13;
2.     Field Survey. To support the review process a field survey was conducted of the sites by&#13;
representatives of the MOH and IDA (MN2WG, TWURD, ENVLW). This inspection covered the entire&#13;
area of the site by the team which was assisted by the chief surveyor for Gaza. The inspection of the site&#13;
was done on foot, local residents were consulted and sketch maps were prepared of the site. The survey&#13;
confirmed that the proposed site does not have any known formal or informal housing which would require&#13;
involuntary relocation.&#13;
3.     At the request of IDA, the MOH is having detailed maps prepared of the location which will show&#13;
current land use and identify the parties involved. The project team is working with the MOH and the&#13;
concerned municipal governments to develop proposed compensation measures for parties which are&#13;
engaged in agriculture on a formal and informnal basis. The proposed compensation packages and their&#13;
method of payment will be subject to review and approval by the Resident Mission and EMTEN as a&#13;
condition for negotiation of the Trust Fund Credit Agreement and payments will be made to affected parties&#13;
prior to undertaking the demonstration activity.&#13;
4.     Review by Palestinian Agencies. The demonstration site has been subject to field visits by&#13;
representatives of the Environmental Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Planning and International&#13;
Cooperation and the Palestinian Department of Archaeology of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.&#13;
Both these organizations have provided formal clearances for the proposed demonstration activity. No site&#13;
visits were required by representatives of the Ministry of Culture since the proposed activities did not&#13;
involve any historic structures.&#13;
Tal El-Hawa Demonstration Site&#13;
5.     Tal El-Hawa. The Tal El-Hawa site is located in the southern part of Gaza Municipality and covers&#13;
and area of 406 dunums. The field review indicates that the area is suitable for development for housing&#13;
under the HDC. The site is surrounded on all four sides by existing housing and is bordered by three sides&#13;
by large roads which provide adequate access to the site. Current land use at the site includes areas which&#13;
are used, under both formal leases with the municipality and under informal use rights established during&#13;
the Israeli occupation, for the cultivation vegetables, vines and trees. A portion of the site is covered with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 11 of 12&#13;
trees, brush and other vegetation. Several sections of the site are being illegally excavated for sand and used&#13;
as solid waste disposal sites. The site does not have any housing units which will be subject to voluntary or&#13;
involuntary resettlement.&#13;
6.     Potential Impacts. The potential impacts from implementation of the proposed activity are limited&#13;
in their scope and can be addressed through implementation of mitigation actions and monitoring. The&#13;
primary impacts include:&#13;
a.   Conversion of Open Area. The site will be converted from an open area into a housing&#13;
development which will include planned public and family use areas. Trees, brush and other&#13;
types of vegetation will be removed from most of the site and the topography of the site will&#13;
be altered to allow for development of the land and to assure proper stormwater drainage.&#13;
The change in land use will be irreversible.&#13;
b.   Loss of Areafor Cultivation. The site will cease to be used for the low intensity cultivation&#13;
of vegetables, vines and fruit trees. The site is composed of mobile sand and does not&#13;
possess valuable soil types which should be conserved for agricultural production.&#13;
c.   Control of Unauthorized Sand Excavation and Waste Disposal. A major positive benefit&#13;
of the proposed activity will be the ending of extensive unauthorized excavation of sand&#13;
from two extensive pits which have been illegally established on the site. These are up to 15&#13;
meters deep and create a hazard for local residents and result in seasonal ponding of water&#13;
resulting in the creation of breeding habitat for mosquitoes. It will also result in the ending&#13;
of the use of the site for waste disposal purposes by a wide range of unauthorized parties.&#13;
7.     Mitigation Actions. Proposed mitigation actions for this activity are:&#13;
a.    Conservation of Acacia Trees. Field review of the site by the Environmental Planning&#13;
Directorate resulted in a formal request that the design for the site include provision for the&#13;
protection of an area of acacia trees located in the central and eastern portion of the site. The&#13;
MOH has agreed to this proposal and adopted it as a mitigation for development of the site.&#13;
b.    Compensationfor Agricultural Users. A compensation package, acceptable to IDA, should&#13;
be provided to those parties which have established formal and informal land use rights at&#13;
the site and have established trees and grapevines on portions of the site. The compensation&#13;
package should be developed following the procedures outlined in the next steps section in&#13;
Para. 9 (below).&#13;
c.    Use ofArchaeological Chance Find Procedures. The MOH will require its contractors and&#13;
private sector developers to use "archaeological chance find procedures" given the potential&#13;
for unknown archaeological materials to be uncovered at this site during the excavation and&#13;
construction process.&#13;
8.     Monitoring Actions. Implementation of the proposed activity will be monitored by the MOH and&#13;
Resident Mission. Both parties will assure that no construction activities will be undertaken until the&#13;
activities outlined in Para. 9 (below) are completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 12 of 12&#13;
9.     Next Steps. Prior to approval of the proposed activity the following actions should be taken by the&#13;
MOH to resolve the compensation of parties which have formal and informal land use rights at the site as&#13;
follows:&#13;
a.  Complete Review of the Legal Status of the Site. The MOH should complete the review of&#13;
official land ownership status of each proposed site. This review will identify any outstanding&#13;
claims or disputes concerning title to all or any portion of the site.&#13;
b.  Complete the Survey of Current Land Use on the Site. A map should be prepared for each&#13;
site which shows the current land use, including both authorized and unauthorized activities.&#13;
c.  Complete the Identifcation of Formal and Informal Users. A list should be made prepared&#13;
which will be keyed to the map which will identify to the fullest extent possible the names of&#13;
the formal and informal users and provide information on the basis for their land use activities&#13;
on the sites. To the extent they are available information or copies of leases or other&#13;
authorizations for agriculture or other activities should be collected.&#13;
d.  Conduct a Consultation with Formal and Informal Users. The MOH should organize a&#13;
public consultation process with formal and informal users of the proposed site. This&#13;
consultation will include a review of the proposed activity, the rights of the affected parties,&#13;
and the procedures to be used for compensation. The process will provide for an opportunity&#13;
for potentially affected parties to express their views and preferences with regard to&#13;
compensation.&#13;
e.  Prepare an Estimate of Potential Compensation for Formal and Informal Users.&#13;
Preliminary information should be prepared concerning proposed costs of compensation for&#13;
parties with either formal or informal land use rights. All compensation will be based on real&#13;
market rates which reflect real market value and replacement costs.&#13;
f.  Payment of Compensation. The MOH, in consultation with the municipal government and&#13;
affected parties, will prepare a proposal for payment of compensation which will be formally&#13;
reviewed and approved by the Resident Mission with the support of EMTEN as required.&#13;
Following IDA approval the MOH will make payments and the site will be available for&#13;
development under the HDC.&#13;

            West Bank and Gaza - Housing Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The housing project seeks to demonstrate
            that appropriate, lower cost housing options can be achieved
            and that financing can be made available on a sustainable
            basis. The specific objectives of the project are to: a) put
            in place institutions, policies and actions necessary to
            building and sustain a well-functioning housing sector; b)
            make housing more affordable by initiating the development
            of a competitive, market-based mortgage system, accompanied
            by well-targeted assistance to lower -income households; and
            c) reduce house prices for lower income households by
            reducing obstacles to the availability of land; promoting a
            competitive development process for lower cost alternatives;
            and providing assistance for the capital costs of
            infrastructure. The three project components are: a)
            institutional and policy development component; b) housing
            finance component, including, a secondary mortgage facility,
            a mortgage indemnity fund, and a housing assistance fund; c)
            housing development component which will help finance the
            off-site infrastructure and basic community facilities, a
            demonstration site, and construction finance.
