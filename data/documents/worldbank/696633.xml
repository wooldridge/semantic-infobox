RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
COMMUNIfY SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:              Russian Federation&#13;
Benericiaries:         Ministry of Nationalities and Federal Affairs, Novosibirsk and Rostov Oblast&#13;
Administrations, and suboblast administrations in these oblasts.&#13;
Amount:                US$200 million&#13;
Terns:                 Payable in seventeen years, including five years of grace, at the standard&#13;
variable interest rate for LIBOR-based dollar single-currency loans.&#13;
On-lending terns:      The two participating oblasts would receive $194 million, half on a grant basis&#13;
and half as a loan at a variable rate of interest of up to 2.5 percent above the&#13;
World Bank's lending rate, payable in twelve years, including three years of&#13;
grace. Repayment obligations of raions and other local beneficiaries will be&#13;
determined by their revenue capacities, but should not be smaller than 10%&#13;
of their share of the loan.&#13;
Project Objectives:    This is intended as a replicable demonstration project, designed to: (i) reduce&#13;
the present deterioration of education, health, and water supply and sanitation&#13;
facilities in Novosibirsk and Rostov oblasts; (ii) improve the efficiency of&#13;
managing public resources; (iii) foster private sector development;  (iv)&#13;
promote broad participation, including non-governmental participation, in&#13;
decision-making; and (v) monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of new&#13;
financial, procurement and participatory practices and disseminate the reults&#13;
in order to improve such practices elsewhere in the Russian Federation.&#13;
Project Description:    The proposed Loan would finance small-scale investments in selected types of&#13;
education, health and water supply and sanitation infrastructure and would&#13;
introduce new mechanisms for appraising and implementing such subprojects.&#13;
(i) The Education Component would finance the rehabilitation of schools&#13;
providing general education (including an expansion of capacity in a small&#13;
number of schools, and two to three new schools).  (ii) The Health&#13;
Component would include the rehabilitation and upgrading of the core&#13;
functions of selected municipal and emergency hospitals and polyclinics. (iii)&#13;
The Water Supply and Sanitation Component would include small-scale&#13;
investments to rehabilitate and upgrade existing water and wastewater&#13;
infrastructure. Each sectoral component would include consulting services and&#13;
training to strengthen local subproject design and implementation capacity and&#13;
financial, managerial and environmental practices. (iv) A Budgetary and&#13;
Expenditure Management component would provide consulting assistance to&#13;
the administrations to reform budgetary processes and control expenditures.&#13;
(v) A Monitoring and Evaluation Component would focus on the lessons for&#13;
project replication, and assistance would be provided to prepare future&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
Benefits:               The project would meet an urgent need by preserving and improving essential&#13;
community services that are fundamental to social well-being. It would also&#13;
demonstrate important improvements in the efficiency of use of public&#13;
resources, through innovations in: (i) the process of determining expenditure&#13;
priorities and project selection at a local level; and (ii) improvements to the&#13;
quality of social infrastructure, through design improvements and greater&#13;
attention to construction quality. Approved subprojects would meet a set of&#13;
selection criteria, would be cost-effective, and where appropriate would show&#13;
positive present values at a 15% rate of discount. The project would also&#13;
foster private sector development by encouraging the break-up and&#13;
privatization of existing architectural and engineering design institutes and&#13;
introducing competitive bidding procedures to private construction companies.&#13;
The project would promote broad participation, including non-governmental&#13;
participation, in decision-making, which should itself contribute to&#13;
improvements in design and construction quality of social facilities, and&#13;
improved maintenance procedures. More generally, it should contribute to a&#13;
sense of local ownership of, and responsibility for, social infrastructure, and&#13;
contribute to the Russian Government's policy of decentralization.&#13;
Risks:                  The complexity inherent in a multi-sectoral project in two oblasts could&#13;
impede implementation. To reduce this risk, the project has sharply limited&#13;
the range of eligible subprojects within each sector. The introduction of new&#13;
methods of subproject selection and implementation is being done in a phased&#13;
manner, beginning with a strategy of "preparation by doing" which has&#13;
involved extensive training in issues of subproject selection, appraisal and&#13;
design of model subprojects, and procurement processes. An alternative risk&#13;
is that in the interests of rapid implementation, the longer term benefits of the&#13;
project in changing the way subnational administrations do business would be&#13;
neglected. To reduce this risk, a strong emphasis would be placed on local&#13;
ownership and participation, and the use of the established administrative&#13;
structures at oblast level to the extent possible. A Mid-Term Project Review&#13;
would focus on ways to ensure that the proven methods of implementation and&#13;
other lessons from the project are gradually transferred into the regular&#13;
programs of the oblast. Similarly there may be a reversion to construction&#13;
methods that speed up subproject completion at the expense of construction&#13;
quality, higher maintenance costs, and shorter life of the facility. To reduce&#13;
this risk, there will be extensive training of architects, engineers, site&#13;
supervisors and clients, and regular supervision by consultants until a new&#13;
implementation culture takes hold.&#13;
Poverty Category:       Although the project is not part of the Program of Targeted Interventions,&#13;
because its benefits are spread broadly among the population as a whole,&#13;
preservation of universal access to basic social services is an essential element&#13;
in any safety net. In Russia, this is particularly important because there is&#13;
virtually no private provision of health or basic education services outside&#13;
major metropolitan areas, both as a consequence of Soviet policy, and because&#13;
the vast majority of the population have suffered a severe decline in living&#13;
standards, and could not afford private social services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Environmental&#13;
Aspects:                    This project has an environmental rating of "B".  Environmental aspects&#13;
related to the rehabilitation of hospitals and schools are limited to the use of&#13;
non-hazardous materials and proper management of medical waste and other&#13;
solid waste. Subprojects of the water and sanitation component as well as&#13;
construction of new schools and extensions and medical facilities would&#13;
require appropriate environmental analysis. The project would have a positive&#13;
envirommental impact as it would: (i) improve overall hospital and school&#13;
conditions and waste management in these facilities; (ii) facilitate access to&#13;
water supply and sanitation; (iii) reduce environmental damage to underground&#13;
water supplies; (iv) augment wastewater treatment capacity and improve the&#13;
standards of treatment and quality of water delivered to the supply networks;&#13;
and (v) limit losses of treated water from leakage and pipe failures. The&#13;
project includes an environmental institutional strengthening program which&#13;
consists of three subcomponents: institutional support, training and&#13;
environmental studies. Some of the training activities took place during&#13;
project preparation, partially financed by the Black Sea Environmental&#13;
Program (BSEP). Support from this source is expected to continue, and&#13;
additional grant financing is being sought.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. Econoniic and Sectoral Background&#13;
1.1            Decentralization is the cornerstone of Russian economic and political reform. This has&#13;
been particularly rapid and dramatic in the social sectors, where, since 1992, subnational authorities have&#13;
had increasing financial responsibility, and considerable freedom of policy action, for most education and&#13;
health activities.'' The importance of municipal budgets in the provision of social services is growing.&#13;
In 1992, the Federal budget share in the total social expenditure (without housing subsidies) was 32%;&#13;
in 1993 and 1994, it declined to 18%. Meanwhile the share of enterprise-financed services (including&#13;
housing and social services) has been decreasing as enterprises have been struggling to survive during&#13;
a period of severe economic decline, and as privatization encourages and sometimes forces the transfer&#13;
of their social assets and the costs of their maintenance to municipality budgets. In the past, enterprises&#13;
often provided maintenance services to an adopted school or public building, even where they had no&#13;
ownership or formal responsibility to do so. Such help is less and less available.&#13;
1.2             The fiscal position of subnational authorities varies considerably, and although a&#13;
reallocative mechanism intended to reduce these disparities improved in transparency and automaticity&#13;
during 1994, the capacity to cope with increased expenditure responsibilities remains very unequal.&#13;
Difficulties have been compounded by a fall in tax revenues. Tax contributions by enterprises have in&#13;
many cases dropped substantially, as large enterprises have encountered serious financial difficulties and&#13;
mechanisms for taxing a growing private sector remain weak. For many subnational administrations, the&#13;
fiscal situation is extremely grave.&#13;
1.3             Although budgetary reform  was intended to eliminate the automatic norm-based&#13;
budgeting of the Soviet period, many authorities find it difficult to exercise any budgetary discretion.&#13;
Salary scales for workers paid from the budget are established in Moscow, and other recurrent&#13;
expenditures are likely to follow established norms-for example, a norm for class size and teaching hours&#13;
may determine school staffing ratios, and the number of hospital beds for a particular sort of treatment&#13;
may determine a norm for expenditures on pharmaceuticals and patient food. In these circumstances, a&#13;
municipal government facing a fiscal crisis is apt to defer most maintenance and capital repairs. Of the&#13;
very limited resources available for investment, most are going to housing and public utilities, with little&#13;
remaining for social infrastructure and services. For example, in the city of Novosibirsk in July 1994,&#13;
only about 20% of the minimum requirements for the regular winterization program of schools was met.&#13;
In many of the local jurisdictions., no resources have been allocated to the maintenance of facilities in the&#13;
last three years.&#13;
1.4            This proposed demonstration project would focus on the rehabilitation of infrastructure&#13;
to provide basic health, education, and water supply and sanitation services. These sectors were selected&#13;
because of their importance to household welfare and the immense need for additional investment. The&#13;
need to continue to supply such services is unchallenged, although new financial mechanisms to be&#13;
' In this Report, the term "oblasts' is used to refer to the first level down of sub-national governments--i.e. to&#13;
the 'subjects of the Federation"--and "raions" to refer to the second level--i.e. municipal governments and&#13;
rural raions.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                                    CHAPTER 1&#13;
developed in this project can increase efficiency. Moreover, rehabilitation can often be justified from&#13;
the potential savings in recurrent costs alone.&#13;
The Soviet Legacy&#13;
1.5             Lack of maintenance is only partly responsible for the very poor state of social&#13;
infrastructure. The root causes lie in a Soviet system that underinvested in education and health facilities&#13;
and housing, regarding such investment as "unproductive" compared with investment to produce&#13;
commodities, misallocated the investment that did take place, and vastly overcentralized processes of&#13;
decision-making, design and implementation, ignoring local circumstances and distorting individual&#13;
incentives.&#13;
1.6             Underinvestment in educational facilities can be seen in the fact that multiple shift&#13;
schools are common throughout the country, and the share of children assigned to the second or third&#13;
shift has been growing steadily over the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1992/1993 academic year, 24% of&#13;
pupils attended second and third shifts, ranging from 10% in Komi-Permyatsky Autonomous Okrug to&#13;
38% in Chechen and Ingush republics. The most advanced area was the North-West with an average&#13;
coefficient of 15%; the city of St. Petersburg had only 12% of students attending the second shift. In&#13;
general, the European part of Russia tends to be better placed than average, and Siberia, the Caucasus&#13;
and especially the Far East, worse than average. Although there may be efficiency reasons in favor of&#13;
a two-shift system (in terms of space and premises utilization), the pressure on facilities is great, the&#13;
length of the school day is short, and the quality of education can suffer; and the third shift is clearly&#13;
undesirable. In addition, there has been marginal investment in basic maintenance of existing facilities.&#13;
Schools are often very poorly equipped in terms of basic sanitary facilities. This has led to facility&#13;
closing and placed additional pressure on the education system.&#13;
1.7             Some health facilities were originally designed for other uses. Another manifestation&#13;
of underinvestment in, and misallocation among, health facilities is the fact that some of the world's&#13;
highest ratios of doctors and hospital beds per head of population are found in under-equipped and often&#13;
unsanitary facilities. A 1988 government survey of the condition of health facilities found that 20 percent&#13;
of Russian hospitals lacked piped hot water, three percent lacked piped cold water, and 17 percent lacked&#13;
appropriate sanitation facilities. The survey also found that among hospitals and polyclinics, one in seven&#13;
buildings needed basic renovation. A 1988 inventory of facilities found substantial underinvestment in&#13;
maintenance of polyclinics and hospitals, with 19 percent of polyclinics and 23 percent of hospitals rated&#13;
as either "disastrous" or as "requiring reconstruction" 2-' Poor facilities, together with outdated technology&#13;
and medical approaches, may have contributed to the stagnation in Russian life expectancies in the 1970s&#13;
and 1980s, in contrast to sustained improvement in OECD countries.&#13;
1.8             A well developed infrastructure of water supply and distribution and wastewater&#13;
collection and treatment appears to exist only within urban centers. Wastewater facilities in rural areas&#13;
generally rely on individual septic tanks, with municipalities' providing an emptying service. Much of&#13;
the infrastructure was developed in the early 1960s and some school buildings and polyclinic (and their&#13;
plumbing) date back to the early 1900s. Owing to a combination of poor quality construction materials&#13;
and standards and subsequent lack of maintenance, much of the infrastructure is in a very deteriorated&#13;

CHAPTER 1                                                                                    3&#13;
condition. For example, most pipelines for water and wastewater are of unprotected steel construction.&#13;
As a result of corrosion there are now high leakage losses from water mains (believed to be in excess of&#13;
30% of water supply) and high levels of infiltration of ground water into water mains and sewers. Little&#13;
attention has been paid to standards of quality in plumbing and sanitary installations in building&#13;
developments with the result that water wastage within properties is excessive.&#13;
1.9             Over-centralization has had many adverse consequences. For example, the design of&#13;
facilities has generally been standardized, and local design institutes have normally only adapted central&#13;
designs to local conditions. The extent of local adaptation has varied considerably, depending on the&#13;
climate, soil conditions, and the local availability of building materials. Appropriate adaption was not,&#13;
however, always possible --for example, the introduction of quantity-oriented prefabrication in the 1960's&#13;
led to very simplified designs for schools, which could not easily be adapted to site conditions or to the&#13;
individual wishes of the clients. More cost-effective and efficient designs should be developed.&#13;
1.10            Architects and engineers have worked in isolation from technological improvements&#13;
elsewhere--for example, the design of hospitals has continued to incorporate inappropriate facilities which&#13;
reduce cost-effectiveness and even success of treatment. Designers and builders have paid little attention&#13;
to existing Government building standards, without fear of adverse professional consequences or financial&#13;
retribution. The inefficiency of the water supply system is largely due to technical faults. Water losses&#13;
are excessively high and although water consumption varies widely, it is generally far above levels&#13;
commonly found in Western Europe and North America. Distribution systems generally rely only on&#13;
pumps to control the pressure, which results in high energy costs (over two-thirds of the operating costs&#13;
in some cases) and frequent pressure fluctuations and network disruptions and breaks. Such designs&#13;
therefore lead to very high general operating costs and prevent municipal water authorities from&#13;
controlling or cutting costs, or improving the condition of the water system. In wastewater treatment,&#13;
many costly investments have been made in projects that have proved to be inoperable. This applies&#13;
particularly in the field of sludge treatment and disposal, where the technology used is significantly below&#13;
international standards.&#13;
1.11            Distorted incentives created many problems. Building programs were inefficient -- too&#13;
many projects were started, and relatively few were completed, at least in the past decade; it may have&#13;
been felt by their initiators that the more construction that was started, the larger would be the subsequent&#13;
construction budget. It is not unusual for construction of schools and water supply treatment works and&#13;
pipelines, and sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants to take up to 12 years to complete. In&#13;
some cases, steel pipelines failed through corrosion before other construction on the project was&#13;
completed.&#13;
1.12           There has been little attempt at a careful analysis of priorities and needs, resulting in&#13;
an imbalance between new investment and maintenance. Maintenance and repair of the existing water&#13;
and wastewater infrastructure have been significantly less than required for efficient operations.&#13;
Investments have been largely directed towards the construction of new capital works to meet inordinately&#13;
excessive per capita norms for drinking water supply and wastewater treatment. (A water consumption&#13;
figure of 360 liters per person per day is considered the norm, compared with about 200 liters in Western&#13;
Europe.) Moreover responsibility for public investments in the social sectors was previously carried out&#13;
by the relevant central branch ministries (e.g., Ministry of Health or Ministry of Education) whereas&#13;
responsibility for maintenance expenditure was vested in local budgets.0 Decisions about new investment&#13;
did not consider sustainability, and there was little incentive to maintain the facilities properly since their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                                  CHAPTER 1&#13;
replacement would be financed by another budget. As a result, maintenance has been neglected and&#13;
repairs made only on an ad hoc basis when something has gone seriously wrong, with the result that&#13;
buildings have progressively deteriorated.&#13;
1.13            Little attention has been given to cost-effectiveness in design, especially given the&#13;
distortions in prices compared with international ones, which kept the price of energy low. Insulation&#13;
of buildings and pipes is lacking, resulting in three times the input of energy compared with normal&#13;
international standards3'. Designs of many schools have an excessive proportion of corridor space to&#13;
teaching space, and are poorly adjusted to needs; classrooms frequently have the same design and&#13;
equipment for all grades. In health, the use of hospital beds as the primary budgetary norm led to an&#13;
overemphasis on bed capacity and lack of attention to other medical requirements. The ultimate users&#13;
of facilities have played no part in the design process.&#13;
1.14            The inadequate state of existing infrastructure owes even more to the low quality of&#13;
construction than of design. Such things as material for sealing the junction between window frames and&#13;
walls, or seasoned timber for roof trusses, might be specified by the architect, but not readily available&#13;
to the contractor. As a result the windows leak and roof trusses warp, and buildings are uncomfortable&#13;
and waste energy.  In general, the quality of construction deteriorated after the introduction of&#13;
prefabrication in the 1960s; as a result, older buildings are often in better condition than comparatively&#13;
new ones. In addition, on-site supervision was lax: nobody involved in a civil works project had any&#13;
incentive to reject construction work because of its low quality and the city building inspectors still lack&#13;
power to reject poor workmanship or materials. By the time a Department of Education took possession&#13;
of a new school, it might be too late to do anything to correct its faults. The problem was a systemic&#13;
one, rather than a lack of construction skills; well constructed buildings can be found, reflecting either&#13;
the political clout of the original user, or an unusually tough and energetic construction supervisor.&#13;
Sectornd Situation in Novosibirsk and Rostov Oblasts'-&#13;
1.15           The oblasts of Rostov and Novosibirsk have been selected for the Project as being both&#13;
different from each other in economic structure and geography, but also representative of a large number&#13;
of oblasts. The sectoral situation in both oblasts does not differ significantly from the national picture.&#13;
1.16           In education, insufficient funds have been allocated to carry out even minimal&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation. In Novosibirsk Oblast, while the school population has remained&#13;
relatively constant, the number of school places is actually declining due to a decreased number of&#13;
classrooms available for instruction. Rostov Oblast has been able to finance school rehabilitation at a&#13;
level that is only marginally better than Novosibirsk and substantial rehabilitation work is required there&#13;
as well. In addition, substantial new construction is required due to lack of investnent in new schools&#13;
during the past decade and in order to meet the needs of growing school age populations in the suburbs&#13;
of major municipalities.  The settlement of new migrants in the suburbs has resulted in severe&#13;
overcrowding in surrounding catchment areas -- double shifting of schools is the rule and triple shifting&#13;
is common. Oblast and municipal levels of government do not have adequate capacities for school facility&#13;

CHAPTER 1                                                                                    5&#13;
planning consistent with their new responsibilities in this area. School facilities planning has only&#13;
recently devolved from the Federal level of government.&#13;
1.17           In health, in 1988, 22 percent of the hospitals in Rostov oblast lacked access to sewage&#13;
systems and about the same percentage lacked access to hot water. For Novosibirsk oblast, only&#13;
information about access to hot water is available: 20 percent had none. Russia's allocation to health,&#13;
which was estimated to be about four percent of GDP in 1993, has been low compared to that of other&#13;
industrial economies, particularly in view of liberalization of prices of equipment, pharmaceuticals, and&#13;
other supplies over the last several years, although Russia still benefits from the favorable ratios of&#13;
medical personnel and hospital beds inherited from the past. Recent estimates suggest that per-capita&#13;
health expenditure levels reverted in 1993 to 1990-91 levels, but the state of medical facilities must have&#13;
further deteriorated in 1992-1993. This is certainly likely to be the situation in the project oblasts where&#13;
levels of health finance are still only about 70-80 percent of 1990 levels.&#13;
1.18           The water supply and sanitation situation is particularly serious. In recent years, the&#13;
income of water utilities has fallen and in consequence investment in operational repairs and maintenance&#13;
has been further curtailed. In most municipal water supply systems there are daily interruptions in supply&#13;
-- e.g. water availability is confined to two hour periods in the morning, afternoon and evening. In many&#13;
districts leakage levels from the distribution network are so high that it is not possible to maintain&#13;
adequate pressure to properly supply dwelling apartments at the 4th or 5th story level and above. Lack&#13;
of maintenance at water treatment works coupled with inefficient treatment systems are responsible for&#13;
water quality problems both chemically and bacteriologically. The problems in bacteriological quality&#13;
are further exacerbated by lack of investment in cleaning and re-lining of the water main distribution&#13;
network. Many municipalities obtain raw water for drinking water by abstraction from rivers, which are&#13;
usually heavily polluted due to untreated or inadequately treated sewage or industrial effluent discharges.&#13;
In both oblasts great reliance is placed on high levels of pre-chlorination in order to overcome the&#13;
problems of pollution of the raw water abstractions. The operational condition and standard of&#13;
maintenance of the chlorination stations is not considered to be satisfactory.&#13;
1.19           Sewerage systems in all the municipalities visited during project preparation are in a&#13;
deteriorated state. In many rural municipalities sewer cleaning equipment is not available. Sewer&#13;
blockages occur frequently due either to hydraulic overloading, poor design, insufficient gradients or&#13;
structural failure of the pipeline. Most sewer networks depend on pumping stations at some point in the&#13;
system. Standards of electrical and mechanical maintenance at these stations are inadequate as finance for&#13;
the purchase of spare parts is not available. Much of the electrical and mechanical equipment in the&#13;
pumping stations is now past its recognized life span (15-20 years) and is in need of replacement. Where&#13;
pumping stations break down, pollution of an adjacent watercourse by a sewage overflow is usually&#13;
inevitable. Similarly the vehicle fleets used for providing the municipal cesspit emptying service are in&#13;
poor operating condition due to the age of the vehicles and the lack of spare parts. As a result the&#13;
municipalities are not able to empty cesspits as frequently as required and as a consequence there are&#13;
health hazards arising from cesspit overflows. The continuing deterioration in the condition of the&#13;
sewerage and wastewater infrastructure is the cause of enviromnental damage particularly with respect&#13;
to pollution of both surface and underground waters.&#13;
1.20           Water demand management (control of water leakage, water wastage and misuse within&#13;
properties) has been ignored. In both oblasts, there are high levels of water wastage due to the poor&#13;
condition of plumbing and sanitary installations within most residential properties. Most factory&#13;

enterprises have metered water supplies but meters are old and have not been adequately maintained. In&#13;
the cities of Rostov-on-Don and Novosibirsk the water undertakings are operated on behalf of the&#13;
municipal authorities by vodokanals (water companies). Revenue income to meet operational costs has&#13;
in the past been derived largely from factory enterprises with shortages in operating budgets being made-&#13;
up by subsidies from either municipal budgets (in the case of the larger cities of Rostov and Novosibirsk)&#13;
or by oblast budgets. For domestic consumers water charges are based on norms and cost recovery is&#13;
only a fraction of the true cost of supply, although it is planned to phase out these subsidies by year&#13;
20055'. Rural raion administrations have neither the financial resources nor the professional expertise&#13;
required to enable them satisfactorily to operate and maintain the existing facilities.&#13;
B. The Government's Reform Strategy&#13;
Economic and Budgetary Reforms&#13;
1.21           Economic reform is the establishment of new systems of responsibilities and incentives.&#13;
However, old habits are difficult to change and today, the Russian economy resonates with echoes of all&#13;
the problems of the Soviet system. Nevertheless, since 1991, major advances have been made towards&#13;
a system in which decisions have been genuinely decentralized, and are increasingly taken in the light of&#13;
true social costs and benefits. These include the substantial liberalization of prices and foreign exchange&#13;
markets, and also of most import and export controls. Despite obvious pressures for protection, average&#13;
tariffs on imports are only about 14%, and the recent Stand-by Agreement with the IMF reduces&#13;
maximum import duties to 30%. The massive subsidization of food and housing expenditures that&#13;
characterized the Soviet regime has been considerably reduced, in some instances being replaced by&#13;
targeted assistance. Of particular relevance to this project is the phased elimination of subsidies on house&#13;
maintenance and public utilities to domestic consumers which is due to be completed by the end of 1998.&#13;
This should enable municipal vodokanals, such as those in Rostov-on-Don and Novosibirsk, which would&#13;
benefit from this project, to recover their costs after that time.&#13;
1.22           A centerpiece of the economic reform program has been the largest privatization&#13;
program ever undertaken. By the time the voucher program ended in October 1994, over two-thirds of&#13;
large and medium enterprises and over 80% of small enterprises had either been privatized or had a&#13;
majority interest auctioned for vouchers. The construction industry is now almost entirely privatized, and&#13;
there have been some moves in the direction of competitive bidding for publicly-financed civil works.t'&#13;
1.23           As already noted, the centralized budgetary system has been replaced by a system of&#13;
fiscal federalism, based on pre-assigned shares of the major taxes7'. However, the Federal budget still&#13;
retains a significant redistributive function. In 1992 regions of the Russian Federation received transfers&#13;
5/ Removal of all subsidies to housing maintenance and public utilities by year 2005 is a Federal legal mandate.&#13;
There have been suggestions that the time period may be lengthened but the policy objective is clear.&#13;
6' Annex 1.2 discusses the results of a survey of private construction firms in Novosibirsk and Rostov-on-Don,&#13;
undertaken as part of the preparation of this project.&#13;
7/In 1995, subnational govermments retain 25% of VAT, up to (but usually) 63% of profit taxes, 90% of&#13;
personal income taxes, and 50% of the excise tax on alcohol.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 1                                                                                 7&#13;
from the Federal Government of 13.5% of their other revenues; in 1993, 17.8%, and in 1994, 24.9%.&#13;
This is still a low proportion by international standards and the 1995 budget law as passed by the Duma&#13;
proposes a significant reduction in this percentage.-8) In 1992 and 1993, the principles on which these&#13;
transfers were distributed were far from transparent and invited a negotiation process between oblasts and&#13;
the Federal Government, which was not conducive to fiscal discipline, and results were far from&#13;
equitable. In July 1994, the Government formed the Fund for Financial Support to Subjects of the&#13;
Russian Federation to which it allocated 22% of VAT revenues (raised to 27% in 1995) to be distributed&#13;
on a lump-sum basis among the regions in need of budget transfers in proportion to (a) the tax capacity&#13;
of the region and/or (b) an estimate of expected expenditure needs. The latter has tended to reduce the&#13;
transparency and equity of what in principle could be a much improved arrangement. The introduction&#13;
of this Fund has not eliminated targeted transfers. To ameliorate problems created by enterprise&#13;
divestiture of social assets, for example, the Government included funds in the 1994 budget to contribute&#13;
to the costs of operating the transferred facilities. Oblasts submitted requests that greatly exceeded the&#13;
amounts budgeted, and again the resulting allocation lacked transparency.&#13;
1.24           Much less attention has been paid to fiscal relations between oblasts and raions, since&#13;
these are entirely an oblast responsibility. Sub-oblast authorities continue to lack an incentive to manage&#13;
expenditures efficiently. The extent to which the levy of authorized local taxes can augment existing&#13;
revenues is in most cases less than 2-3 % of the budget2'. Moreover, the budget preparation/management&#13;
system currently in place is reactive rather than proactive. This reflects both uncertainty of revenue&#13;
yields in a declining economic situation, and unpredictability of expenditure needs. The prior-year&#13;
collection information is used and prior-year (enterprise) production information is used to forecast&#13;
revenue yields. Both of these sources have proved ineffective in a hyper-inflationary situation. While&#13;
desirable from a macroeconomic standpoint, the biggest problem for local budgets, and the single&#13;
significant contributor to the deficits being experienced from Rostov to Vladivostok, is the price of energy&#13;
--fuel oil and coal. Funds provided in the beginning of a budget year to lay in fuel stocks at seasonally&#13;
low summer prices are being diverted to other areas of expenditure and then when winter sets in,&#13;
additional funds are sought from the oblast or other higher government.&#13;
1.25           Current practices of budget preparation are partly "norm" based and partly "prior-year&#13;
actual" based. In both cases, real needs are ignored and the "bottom-line" budget is a result of&#13;
negotiations with the higher government. These methods do not provide the necessary transparency for&#13;
budget preparation. Often budgets are balanced on paper, but in fact operate at a substantial deficit due&#13;
to deferred payments.&#13;
Sectoral Reforms&#13;
1.26           The Government has initiated reforms in each of the social sectors. The Government&#13;
strategy for education reform was reflected in the 1992 Education Law which encouraged curricular&#13;
diversity and decentralized responsibilities for finance and management of compulsory education to&#13;
subnational governments. The same objectives provide the main thrust of the 1993 Federal Program for&#13;
Educational Development. Gradual redistribution of governance and management functions is evidently&#13;
!' See Fiscal Manaiement in the Russian Federation (World Bank Report No. 14862-RU, November 29,1995),&#13;
Chapter 2.&#13;
2' Annex 1.3 describes the recent budgetary situation in Novosibirsk and Rostov.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a                                                                                CHAPTER 1&#13;
underway. Elements of new funding principles are being discussed and introduced, and the content of&#13;
education is changing. Institutional autonomy is increasing in areas of curriculum development, selection&#13;
of teaching methods, and budget management. The pace of reform, however, has been uneven and a lack&#13;
of clear distribution of functions, appropriate institutional structures and incentive systems make effective&#13;
implementation of government plans very difficult, and in some cases unlikely.&#13;
1.27            In health, an April 1993 amended health insurance law fundamentally changed the&#13;
structure of health system finance, organization, and management according to basic principles common&#13;
to most OECD countries. The legislation separates systems of (a) financing health care; (b) organizing&#13;
and managing it or purchasing of care through "insurance companies" or sick funds; and (c) providing&#13;
care. While the first function remains primarily "public," so as to ensure universal access and equity,&#13;
it is anticipated that the two other functions, especially the third (provision of care), will eventually&#13;
become decentralized and "non-governmental," possibly private, so as to promote production efficiency&#13;
and client satisfaction. The separation of functions and the changes in ownership and management of the&#13;
provision of care potentially revolutionize the system. Implementation of the reforms has varied widely,&#13;
however. One element in the health component of this project will be to introduce new financing&#13;
procedures on a pilot basis.&#13;
1.28           Reforms are also affecting the water supply and sanitation sector. In major cities,&#13;
vodokanals have been established as notionally independent enterprises, expected to make an operating&#13;
surplus to be invested in system improvements. This surplus is generally not sufficient for any major&#13;
investment and has been eroded by the rate of inflation which has been much greater than permitted&#13;
increases in tariffs. The Anti-Monopoly Committee, for example, allows a 30% margin on costs when&#13;
setting tariffs, but excludes many customary costs from the rate base including Environment Committee&#13;
fees and fines. In addition, household fees only cover 10 to 20% of costs and have to be cross-subsidized&#13;
by other users. As was noted above, the government has legislated changes in this situation by raising&#13;
user fees. Existing cross-subsidies and accounting practices tend to distort decision-making (for example&#13;
by encouraging vodokanals to inflate costs or enter into barter arrangements with enterprises). However,&#13;
many of the costs are beyond the control of vodokanals and their inability to set tariffs further limits their&#13;
capacity for rational and effective financial management and planning.&#13;
1.29           Financial problems are further exacerbated by existing institutional arrangements. The&#13;
municipal vodokanals lack management autonomy and in many cases do not control investment priorities&#13;
or planning. Distorted financial incentives bias investment towards new capacity expansion projects even&#13;
when the existing facilities are in critical need of rehabilitation and improvement. In many cases, deferred&#13;
and under-funded maintenance has led to further operational inefficiencies.&#13;
C. The Bank's Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.30           The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board on June 6, 1995;&#13;
a CAS Progress Report was discussed with the Board on March 28, 1996. Since the last CAS, the Bank&#13;
has continued to operate under an Intermediate Case scenario, which remains broadly appropriate in the&#13;
current environment. This scenario assumes that there will be continued progress in macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization, as evidenced by the recent agreement with the IMF on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF)&#13;
program. In this situation, the Bank would aim to provide around $1.2-1.5 billion annually in investment&#13;
lending, including a "core" program of relatively straightforward projects in infrastructure and the social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 1                                                                                    9&#13;
sectors. In addition, the Bank would be willing to provide up to $1.5 billion annually in relatively fast-&#13;
disbursing assistance if substantial progress was achieved on key structural reforms in specific areas of&#13;
the economy, such as agriculture and the social sectors, that are critical to the long-term sustainability&#13;
of the stabilization process. Over the past year, the Bank has been working with the Government, both&#13;
within the framework of the EFF negotiations and in separate discussions, to develop a consensus on&#13;
specific programs of structural reforms that would allow these latter operations to move forward. In the&#13;
meantime, the Bank has continued to prepare 6-7 priority investment projects as the basis for a sustained&#13;
program of Bank support for the Russian economy over the medium term.&#13;
1.31            The proposed operation is fully consistent with the CAS described above and has been&#13;
developed in close collaboration with the Government. The project directly supports two of the Bank's&#13;
priority objectives described in the CAS: (i) the development of public sector institutions and procedures&#13;
that would be supportive of open and competitive markets and oriented toward the provision of physical,&#13;
social, legal and institutional infrastructure not normally provided through the private sector; and (ii)&#13;
measures to moderate the impact of transition on socially vulnerable groups by, among other things,&#13;
maintaining social services and infrastructure while improving the efficiency of public expenditures.&#13;
1.32           The proposed project emphasizes more strongly the specific needs of subnational&#13;
governments, and especially the need to reduce the likely social and fiscal problems resulting from the&#13;
withdrawal of enterprises from their traditional role of providing social services to their workers and&#13;
others in their local communities. The proposed project would also respond to the problem that&#13;
investments in constructing, equipping, and maintaining educational and medical facilities and public&#13;
utilities were often made by Soviet enterprises, even where the operating costs were paid from the State&#13;
budget. Since these expenditures were often on an ad hoc basis, there are no data on amounts spent.&#13;
However, it is certain that the withdrawal of this assistance has clearly contributed to the deterioration&#13;
of social infrastructure, which is being addressed in this project. The need to address these concerns was&#13;
expressed in communiques of the July 1993 Summit by the G-7 countries and at the meeting of the&#13;
Finance Ministers in January 1994. It was requested that World Bank assistance be directed towards&#13;
ameliorating this problem. The proposed project was to be the first response to this request; however,&#13;
it soon became apparent that the issue was too complex to be addressed in a single project.&#13;
1.33            Eventually, three potential projects emerged. A reallocation of part of the Privatization&#13;
Implementation Assistance Loan (Loan No. 35460-RU, 1993) is being used to facilitate the transfers of&#13;
kindergartens to municipal administrations, responding to the fact that enterprises have frequently&#13;
abandoned the provision of kindergartens and day care, which accounted for about one-third of enterprise&#13;
social expenditures. Other planned projects would focus on issues of housing maintenance and utility&#13;
subsidies which were the most important social expenditures of enterprises. Although national legislation&#13;
requires these subsidies to be phased out over three years, the withdrawal of this enterprise support&#13;
threatens an immediate fiscal crisis; a Housing Divestiture Project to deal with housing maintenance and&#13;
improvements is also under preparation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE&#13;
2.1           This proposed project would be the first IBRD loan to the Russian Federation where&#13;
prime responsibility for implementation would be that of oblast administrations, involving the three&#13;
sectors: education, health, and water supply and sanitation1!'. Nevertheless there are lessons from the&#13;
experience of projects in other sectors in Russia, and from similar multisectoral, regionally-oriented&#13;
infrastructure projects in other countries.&#13;
A. Lessons from other projects in Russia&#13;
2.2           The 1994 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) observed that almost all projects&#13;
approved by the Bank up to that time had experienced difficulties in implementation. Not all the&#13;
problems were those of project design. However, it was observed that most Project Preparation and&#13;
Implementation Units were established when the process of preparation was largely complete, and that&#13;
this had reduced the participation of the implementing agency in the definition of the project, as well as&#13;
resulting in start-up delays. For the preparation of this proposed project, a small Preparation Unit&#13;
(financed by a Japanese Grant) was established in the Ministry of Nationalities and Federal Affairs&#13;
(MINNAT) soon after the project was identified, and it has worked very closely with regular Ministry&#13;
staff.  In addition, oblast-level project coordinators were nominated by the two project oblast&#13;
administrations in consultation with the Ministry. These preparation units would become fully operational&#13;
PIUs (to be known as Project Bureaus.)&#13;
2.3           The CPPR also highlighted the need for training and other assistance to develop a strong&#13;
local capacity for procurement management. An explicit objective of this proposed project is to improve&#13;
methods of public procurement, especially of civil works. Officials involved in project design and&#13;
coordination have already attended training in procurement; other relevant courses are under preparation.&#13;
2.4           Sources of delays reported in the CPPR include the time needed to receive necessary&#13;
internal approvals prior to loan effectiveness. Where these delays have prevented starting construction&#13;
at an optimum time, they have been very costly in terms of timeliness of output, given the short&#13;
construction season in Russia. Also, unfamiliarity with competitive bidding procedures and slow&#13;
contractor prequalification processes in other projects initially gave rise to skepticism about the openness&#13;
of the competitive bidding process and reduced the amount of competition. The preparation process of&#13;
this proposed project is addressing these potential problems, and is establishing mechanisms which would&#13;
eliminate unnecessary delays in 1996, once the loan is effective.&#13;
2.5           It was also found that Government priorities among subprojects initially put forward for&#13;
financing could change quite substantially between appraisal and the start of implementation, and that&#13;
there was a need for flexibility in the program. The substantial unidentified component would allow for&#13;
the adjustment of priorities over time.&#13;
° Projects in all three sectors are, however, in the lending program in the next two years. It is anticipated that&#13;
the preparatory work for this project and the eventual implementation experience will enable these other&#13;
projects to focus more on policy and institutional reform objectives and less on issues of design and&#13;
execution of civil works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11                                                                              CHAPTER 2&#13;
B. Lessons from Other Countries&#13;
2.6           The World Bank's support of Mexico's National Solidarity Program offers some useful&#13;
lessons. The Program combines Federal grants, loans from national development banks and state and&#13;
local government contributions, to finance over 30 subprogramns, including several types of social&#13;
infrastructure, often intended to complement and strengthen normal investments. Since 1989, for&#13;
example, Solidarity has provided over $600 million in additional financing for educational facilities in&#13;
poor communities. The program involves effective community participation in project selection and&#13;
implementation, and shared responsibility for programs with state and municipal governments (varying,&#13;
however, with the type of program).&#13;
2.7           Evaluations of the first Decentralization and Regional Development (DRD) Loan to&#13;
Mexico (3310-ME, 1990) made in support of the Solidarity Program have found that the project has been&#13;
successful in selecting investments that reflect community priorities and carrying these out cost-&#13;
effectively. Introduction of eligibility criteria eliminated a significant number of uneconomic investments&#13;
and led local agencies to appropriate planning and prioritization. The project was, however, spread too&#13;
broadly over sectors and institutions, which diluted the impact of institutional development, and made&#13;
project monitoring and supervision difficult. Consequently the second DRD Loan cut the number of areas&#13;
of project from ten to four, and the number of implementing state agencies from over 70-24 (three in&#13;
each of the eight states participating in the project). The proposed project establishes firm selection&#13;
criteria for subprojects and limits sharply the number of these; only a narrow range of subprojects in&#13;
three subsectors in two oblasts would be eligible.&#13;
2.8           The first DRD project found that there was a lack of institutional incentives and capability&#13;
on the part of the Federal agency managing the Solidarity program and other state agencies to provide&#13;
technical review and guidance. In the proposed project, each oblast Project Bureau (acting as a PIU) will&#13;
be advised by strong technical consultants with the mandate to monitor technical issues arising in the&#13;
project (which among other things, would reduce the burden of supervision and increase the capacity to&#13;
provide advice to all project beneficiaries as required).&#13;
2.9           One of the proposed project's objectives is to promote private sector development by&#13;
stimulating local competitive bidding for small public works. In its approach to local contracting by&#13;
construction companies with no previous experience of competitive bidding, the project is drawing heavily&#13;
on the successful Bank experience in Africa with projects using the approach of AGETIP (Agence&#13;
d'Execution de Travaux d'Infrastructure Publiques) (for example, Credit No. C2075 to Senegal, 1990).&#13;
The AGETIP experience emphasizes tailoring the approach to the situation in each country and taking&#13;
into consideration the capacity of the local construction industry. Part of project preparation has involved&#13;
surveys of the local construction industry (Annex 1.2). Among other things, experience suggests the&#13;
importance of training contractors how to respond to bidding documents, and the importance of ensuring&#13;
prompt payment to contractors. Attention would be paid to both of these during project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 2                                                                                     12&#13;
2.10          In emphasizing strongly the role of local beneficiaries and in having a substantial&#13;
unidentified component, the Project has a number of features of a Social Investment Fund111. It is likely&#13;
that if this project were to be replicated in other regions of Russia, more explicit Social Investment Funds&#13;
would be formed. A problem with such funds has been their tendency to by-pass line ministries, with&#13;
the danger that any improvements in decision criteria or manner of implementation has not been carried&#13;
into the regular program. In this project, the sectoral administrative departments have been the principal&#13;
players in the identification and design of subprojects, and they would play a critical role in the selection&#13;
of the unidentified components. Another issue has been a tendency for Social Investment Fund projects&#13;
to avoid traditional sector conditionality, such as cost-recovery. These elements have not been neglected&#13;
in either the water supply or the health components of this project.&#13;
2.11          Of the twenty-five municipal infrastructure fund projects approved in the 1980s, only a&#13;
few have operated long enough to show sustainable results. The major lesson appears to be, however,&#13;
that reforms in the structure of capital financing (more technical allocation procedures; shift from grant&#13;
to loan terms) or internal financial management (accounting, taxation, capital budgeting) do little to&#13;
improve local performance if functional responsibilities and revenue authority among different levels of&#13;
government are ill-defined. The intergovernmental fiscal dimension is critical. In most countries, a&#13;
corresponding reform is required in the design and administration of intergovernmental transfers (both&#13;
recurrent and for capital funding). Russia is just now instituting an explicit intergovernmental transfer&#13;
for recurrent purposes but does not have a directed grant or federal loan program for capital financing.&#13;
The proposed project would, in effect, initiate such a channel that might be replicated elsewhere. In&#13;
addition, it would focus on intraoblast fiscal relations between the oblast and local administrations. While&#13;
the project is not proposing any immediate change in fiscal mechanisms, consulting services are being&#13;
provided to help design a more transparent and efficient system, which may then be implemented on a&#13;
pilot basis.&#13;
IL' A review by Soniya Carvalho 'Social Funds: Guidelines for Design and Implementation' (ESP Discussion&#13;
Paper Series No. 24, March 1994) defines a social fund as "a mechanism through which resources are&#13;
channeled, according to pre-determined selection criteria, to demand-driven subprojects proposed by public,&#13;
private, or voluntary (formal or informal) organizations.' Individual subprojects are generally not designed&#13;
at the time the Fund is established, although often several are prepared for disbursement upon loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
HI. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Evolution&#13;
3.1           The proposed project evolved from discussions with the Russian Government on project&#13;
concepts that would support decentralization of Federal responsibilities, help to maintain a basic minimum&#13;
of social services, and respond to the additional problems created by enterprise divestiture of social assets.&#13;
In addition, there is a need to promote reforms in the management of public expenditures at a subnational&#13;
level. The concept agreed with the Government was for a project that would: (a) be multisectoral, to&#13;
stress the need to select expenditure priorities rationally, rather than relying on traditional norms; (b)&#13;
emphasize improved management of public expenditures, focusing both on the choice of activities and&#13;
the efficiency of implementation; and (c) be a monitorable and replicable pilot project in two or three&#13;
oblasts.&#13;
3.2           To facilitate project design, and, especially, implementation, only subprojects in health,&#13;
education and water supply and sanitation infrastructure would be included; subproject types within each&#13;
sector would be restricted to the basic services of polyclinics and general hospitals, to school facilities&#13;
providing a general rather than a vocational education, and to small-scale water and sanitation&#13;
investments. These priorities are all central to Russian Government policy of continuing to provide every&#13;
household with basic social services. It was also found that design and quality of construction of facilities&#13;
were often so unsatisfactory that it would be cost-ineffective to rehabilitate them; instead, it was suggested&#13;
that the proposed project could provide a valuable opportunity to improve design standards and foster an&#13;
implementation culture that would lead to improved construction quality, and to reduce implementation&#13;
and supervision complexities. The oblasts of Novosibirsk and Rostov were selected by the Russian&#13;
Government on the basis of agreed criteria. These are oblasts that are each reasonably representative of&#13;
a broad class of oblasts, but that differ substantially in geographical and economically setting.&#13;
Implementing the proposed project in only two oblasts reduced project complexity and length of&#13;
preparation, without seriously compromising the benefits from regional diversity.&#13;
B. Government Commitment and Beneficiary Participation&#13;
3.3           Although the project finances activities which are exclusively the responsibility of either&#13;
oblast or sub-oblast administrations, it is essential to have an active interlocutor at a Federal level to (a)&#13;
assist with the many preparatory activities that require Federal action; (b) serve as a coordinating agency&#13;
during the process of project implementation; (c) carry out monitoring and evaluation activities whose&#13;
results can be used in any future projects with similar objectives and more generally to ensure that lessons&#13;
from the project are disseminated to appropriate Federal ministries; and (d) represent the interests of the&#13;
Federal Government, which is not only the borrower and guarantor of repayment, but will also directly&#13;
finance half the loan repayment. The Ministry of Nationalities and Federal Affairs (MINNAT) was&#13;
selected for this role, and has been very active in assuming this responsibility. At the start of project&#13;
preparation, MINNAT provided facilities for the Preparation Unit, and staff of MINNAT have&#13;
participated in all major Preparation Missions, as well as in discussions in Moscow. The proposed&#13;
project has also been discussed with other concerned Ministries. An Interministerial Group has been&#13;
organized to comment on some of the proposed methodological or financial innovations, to review the&#13;
results and to disseminate project lessons for individual sectors. Under the Chairmanship of MINNAT,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                                                   CHAPTER 3&#13;
the Group includes representatives of the Ministries of Education, Health, Construction, Finance,&#13;
Economy, and Environment.&#13;
3.4            Project preparation has been mainly the responsibility of the two oblast administrationsL2.&#13;
Facilities have been provided for a project coordinator in each oblast, and a long list of suitable&#13;
subprojects of high priority was almost immediately proposed. All subprojects on which preparatory&#13;
work has been carried out were initially suggested by the oblast, in some cases following consultations&#13;
with the administrations of cities and rural raions. In most instances, the local governments have eventual&#13;
responsibility for operating and maintaining the facilities and the project is designed to ensure that these&#13;
administrations, together with the directors of the facilities concerned, would play a much more direct&#13;
role in implementation and in selecting future subprojects for consideration.&#13;
3.5           A major objective of the project would be to assist in introducing new methods of&#13;
appraising and implementing social infrastructure projects. Therefore, the preparation process has, to&#13;
the extent possible, been one of "preparation by doing." Appraisals and design work on some of the&#13;
identified subprojects prepared by local and international consultants have served as models for training&#13;
Russian consultants to do the same thing with other identified subprojects, and eventually with the&#13;
unidentified component. The latter represents 25% of the subprojects to be financed by the Loan, and&#13;
would prepare the way for eventual replication as a "Social Investment Fund" project (para 2.10). The&#13;
importance of beneficiary participation has already become evident. For example, work required for&#13;
school rehabilitation was originally assessed by a local firm which provided technically competent&#13;
assessments, but did not consult school staff adequately. Only when the survey results were subsequently&#13;
discussed with the school director and staff, did it become clear that there were many other items in the&#13;
school that were also in urgent need of attention, and the rehabilitation plans were modified accordingly.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
3.6            The principal goals of the proposed project are to:&#13;
(a)    Reduce the present deterioration of social infrastructure by financing the rehabilitation&#13;
and limited replacement of high priority facilities for providing health care, education,&#13;
water supply and sanitation;&#13;
(b)    Improve the efficiency of managing public resources by:&#13;
(i)    ensuring that the selection of subprojects is based on sound criteria;&#13;
(ii)   raising facility design standards and improving the incentives to observe them;&#13;
(iii)   improving the quality and sustainability of construction by improved site&#13;
supervision, and by encouraging beneficiaries to take a more active role as clients&#13;
during the design and the construction process;&#13;
(iv)   introducing competitive procurement practices;&#13;
(v)    introducing improved methods of expenditure programming and budgetary&#13;
management by public authorities; and&#13;
LI Funds to assist project preparation were provided by Japanese Grants (Nos. TF025243, dated November 2,&#13;
1994, and TF 029126 and TF 029234, dated July 24, 1995) totalling $1,650,000 equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 3                                                                             15&#13;
(vi)  strengthening environmental management practices through a program of studies&#13;
and training linked to the health and water supply and sanitation components;&#13;
(c)    Promote private sector development through:&#13;
(i)    encouraging the break-up and commercialization of existing design institutes into&#13;
independent engineering and architectural firms;&#13;
(ii)   providing training in procurement processes for engineers, architects, local&#13;
construction firms, and public bid evaluation committees; and&#13;
(iii)   providing an environment that can facilitate the emergence of private providers&#13;
of medical care.&#13;
(d)    Contribute to the Government's policy of decentralization by promoting broad&#13;
participation, including non-governmental participation, in project decision-making; and&#13;
(e)    Monitor the effectiveness of new practices, and disseminate the results, to promote their&#13;
use in similar activities elsewhere in the Russian Federation.&#13;
The indicators that will be used to monitor these objectives are described in Annex 3.7.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
Overview&#13;
3.7          The proposed project would introduce new mechanisms for evaluating and implementing&#13;
small-scale investments in social infrastructure, and finance a number of eligible subprojects to be&#13;
implemented using these mechanisms. To expedite project implementation, and to maximize benefits&#13;
from work carried out during the project preparation phase, preparation funds have been used to identify,&#13;
appraise and advance implementation of a number of selected subprojects in each sector. About 75%&#13;
of the subprojects have been identified and the remainder would be identified as experience is gained with&#13;
implementing the project. Each oblast would make a 10% cash contribution to the cost of each&#13;
subproject. These subprojects, together with other Bank-financed components, are described here as&#13;
World Bank Financed (WBF) subprojectsL''. In addition, the project includes a number of subprojects&#13;
that would be entirely financed by the Government, using the same selection and implementation&#13;
processes as those financed by the loan. These are brought into the project after about two years&#13;
experience has been gained with project implementation experience in order to encourage the use of&#13;
procedures developed under the project in the regular program of the oblast. These are described as Non-&#13;
Bank Financed (NBF) subprojects. The Bank and the Government would agree annually on the additional&#13;
NBF subprojects. At Negotiations, it was agreed that the review procedures to be adopted with respect&#13;
to these NBF subprojects would be the same as for the unidentified subprojects to be financed by the&#13;
Bank. The proportion of the loan to each sector (health, education and water supply and sanitation)&#13;
would be not less than 25% and not more than 40% of the total loan amount in each oblast. This&#13;
restriction would not apply to NBF subprojects. To ensure a broad geographic spread of the use of the&#13;
3/ The government contribution in WBF also includes other direct expenditures, such as incremental operating&#13;
costs for health facilities.&#13;
&#13;

1. Education Component&#13;
Summary&#13;
3.8          In Novosibirsk oblast, the identified parts of the education component include the&#13;
rehabilitation of 20 schools, the construction of two new schools and assistance to improve the planning,&#13;
management and operations of school facilities in the Novosibirsk municipality (MIS program). Energy&#13;
efficiency would be a major consideration. In Rostov oblast, the education component comprises the&#13;
rehabilitation of 14 schools, building extensions to four schools, and the construction of one new school.&#13;
One of these subprojects would be used to assist facilities planning, management and operations following&#13;
an evaluation of experience with the implementation of the MIS subproject in the Novosibirsk&#13;
municipality. A school in each oblast was selected as a pilot subproject to provide experience in design&#13;
and procurement procedures. In both oblasts, assistance would also be provided to assist the Department&#13;
of Education in all aspects of school facilities project management, including identification, preparation&#13;
and implementation of the unidentified education subprojects. A summary of the education project&#13;
components in each oblast is shown in Table 3.1.&#13;
Education Component Objectives&#13;
3.9           Recent World Bank education sector reports have called attention to the crisis in the&#13;
physical condition of school facilities and the lack of capacity of oblast and raion administrations to&#13;
perform newly assigned functions formerly performed by the central governmentL4. These general&#13;
findings were confirmed for Novosibirsk and Rostov oblasts by identification missions during visits in&#13;
July and October, 1994. The immediate objective of the education component would be to help relieve&#13;
an emergency situation in schools that have become so dilapidated, uncomfortable, inefficient and even&#13;
unsafe as to constitute a constraint on effective teaching and a threat to the welfare of students and&#13;
teachers who use them. This objective would be achieved by rehabilitating, extending or, in a few&#13;
instances, replacing existing schools. Three new schools would be built in unserved areas of new&#13;
settlement where there has been substantial in-migration and where students are now attending severely&#13;
overcrowded schools at some distance from their homes.&#13;
3.10          The long-term  objective would be to strengthen all aspects of school facilities&#13;
management, including planning and operations, through (a) improving methodologies for formulating&#13;
investment programs for schools; (b) demonstrating a facility management information system in the&#13;
Novosibirsk municipality; (c) introducing participatory processes for defining education specifications in&#13;
the design of facilities; (d) transferring recent technology and introducing modem building materials for&#13;
school buildings; and (e) providing examples of schools that are energy efficient, economically efficient&#13;
and environmentally benign.&#13;

3.11          Better methodologies for formulating investment programs for schools were introduced&#13;
during the preparation of the education component. The demonstration facility management information&#13;
system (MIS) is a multiphased subproject that would, through consultancy services, training, and&#13;
computerization, progressively introduce improved facilities management in the Novosibirsk municipality.&#13;
Selection Criteria for School Facilities Subprojects&#13;
3.12          The selection of schools to be rehabilitated is based upon a cost-effectiveness analysis&#13;
detailed in Annex 3.1. Generally, this analysis gives a higher priority to schools with large enrollments,&#13;
particularly those that are double- and triple-shifted and whose usage could be extended for at least 10&#13;
years at relatively low cost. A large number of existing schools, which were in other respects of high&#13;
priority, were rejected for rehabilitation or extension, because of severely damaged foundations or&#13;
unsatisfactory design features. School facilities planning in both oblasts is complicated by a precipitous&#13;
decline in fertility largely, but not entirely, offset by substantial in-migration during the last five years.&#13;
New construction would, therefore, be confined to situations where there is a need to replace existing&#13;
facilities or, where there are substantial shifts in the geographic distribution of the population due to&#13;
migration and/or the growth of new population centers. The Oblast would make a direct budgetary&#13;
contribution of 10% of the cost of the rehabilitation and construction of the selected subprojects; in&#13;
addition, the purchasing of all furniture, laboratory and other equipment required to make the school&#13;
operational would also be the responsibility of the Departments of Education in the two oblasts. Before&#13;
a school subproject was finally approved, the School Board would make a formal comrnitment to&#13;
maintaining the facility and would specify how this would be organized.&#13;
3.13          Specifically, the following selection criteria are applied:&#13;
(a)    For rehabilitation school subprojects, the selection criteria are:&#13;
(i)    The subproject is cost-effective in terms of costs per student place. This cost-&#13;
effectiveness measure compares the school with and without the project.&#13;
(ii)    After reconstruction, the school would have an extended life, of at least 10 years:&#13;
i In general, this implies that buildings with damaged foundations and unstable&#13;
load-bearing wails would not be eligible for repairs and reconstruction under the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
* In general, a school's eligibility for reconstruction would be enhanced if its&#13;
design and workmanship of its existing facilities are deemed to be of adequate&#13;
quality. Many older buildings superior to newer structures would be considered&#13;
as candidates for reconstruction.&#13;
(iii)   All required utilities serving the school are adequate.&#13;
(b)    School Extensions (in addition to the adequacy of utilities):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 3                                                                                19&#13;
(i)   the existing school should be rehabilitable to a standard comparable to the new&#13;
construction; and&#13;
(ii)   the new construction should be based upon established educational specifications.&#13;
(c)    For new schools, the specific criteria include, in addition to (a) iii above:&#13;
(i)    The school replaces an existing school that is no longer viable, or it reduces&#13;
overcrowding in the schools that are in adjacent catchment areas.  The&#13;
justification would be based upon an analysis of school age population projections&#13;
in the areas affected and careful analysis of all affected school catchment areas.&#13;
(ii)    The location of the school should be consistent with existing master plans.&#13;
(iii)   The site of the proposed new school should not involve the displacement and&#13;
destruction of existing valuable structures, and should be the property of the&#13;
oblast or raion government.&#13;
3.14          Consultancy Services and Training. The project would finance 15 person-months of&#13;
consultant services to train and assist oblast staff in both Rostov and Novosibirsk in selected aspects of&#13;
school facilities project management, including the identification, preparation and implementation of the&#13;
unidentified education subprojects. Consistent with training needs, particular attention would be given&#13;
to the location of schools, education specifications and to all aspects of procurement.&#13;
3.15          Demonstration School Facilities Management Information System Project (MIS&#13;
program). The work would require 22 person-months of consultancy services to advise the municipality&#13;
of Novosibirsk on a strategy for the progressive improvement in organization and management processes,&#13;
the design of a supporting management information system and to organize two study tours to examine&#13;
state-of-the-art school facilities organizations in Europe or North America. About 24 person-months of&#13;
local consultancy services would be required for programming software. In addition, about 120 person-&#13;
months of local technical staff would be employed to establish information data bases and arrange for&#13;
their maintenance. The component would finance networks for the central administration and links to&#13;
at least two of the ten raions in the municipality in a pilot demonstration project. This would include the&#13;
installation of about 50-80 computers. This pilot would be evaluated before the system is extended during&#13;
the project to the remainder of the municipality. See Annex 3.2 for details.&#13;
2. Health Component&#13;
Sunmary&#13;
3.16          The proposed project would finance the rehabilitation and upgrading of selected city and&#13;
raion hospitals. Each such component would include: (a) an emergency and admission rooms; (b) an&#13;
intensive care unit; (c) an operating room; (d) a central laboratory; (e) a central X-ray and imaging&#13;
facilities; (f) wards; and (g) a delivery unit. The first five items are "core" requirements to enable&#13;
hospitals to function adequately. Supplies for operating the diagnostic and imaging equipment procured&#13;
under the project would also be partially financed for the first two years of its operation. WBF also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                                                                   CHAPTER 3&#13;
includes equipment for selected facilities, whose rehabilitation is being financed by the Government as&#13;
part of NBF.  Consultancy services would be provided to assist the introduction on a pilot basis of new&#13;
financial mechanisms to promote efficiency and financial stability.&#13;
3.17          In addition, the proposed project would finance the rehabilitation and upgrading of&#13;
selected polyclinics. The polyclinic component would normally include: (a) rooms for medical specialists;&#13;
(b) laboratories; (c) x-ray and imaging; and (d) a day care unit for minor surgery.&#13;
3.18          The selection criteria listed below and elaborated in Annex 3.3 are met by many facilities.&#13;
The identified subprojects are shown in Table 3.2. They include three hospitals and two polyclinics in&#13;
Rostov, and four hospitals and two polyclinics in Novosibirsk.&#13;
3.19          Two sites, one in Rostov and one in Novosibirsk, have been chosen as pilots prior to full&#13;
project implementation, and the oblasts would receive substantial technical assistance to enable their&#13;
designers to utilize the lessons of international experience. These subprojects would both provide needed&#13;
lessons for the designs of the remaining facilities, and also establish building standards and provide&#13;
training that would enable Russian specialists to design the remaining facilities themselves under normal&#13;
project supervision.&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
3.20          The objectives of the health component are: (a) to rehabilitate and upgrade selected&#13;
medical facilities in the oblasts of Novosibirsk and Rostov; (b) to improve the methodology and&#13;
institutional capacity for similar efforts in the country as a whole; and (c) to develop new financial&#13;
mechanisms on a pilot basis and test these using project facilities. It is anticipated that achievement of&#13;
these objectives would serve the broader systemic goals of improving the quality, efficiency, and equity&#13;
of medical care in the country.1'5&#13;
3.21          Specifically, the proposed project seeks to improve access to modern care technology in&#13;
selected facilities and management of patients. These improvements would be achieved by a "package"&#13;
of mutually complementary program components, ultimately leading to:&#13;
(a)    better patient flow within and across facilities;&#13;
(b)    an  improved  physical infrastructure designed  to  support basic  medical&#13;
technology, equipment, and patient conditions;&#13;
(c)    access to equipment essential for proper and efficient diagnosis and treatment;&#13;
(d)    improved (acceptable) patient accommodation;&#13;
(e)    personnel who are trained to use and maintain the facilities and equipment; and&#13;
(f)    improved financial and institutional mechanisms to support the functioning of&#13;
rehabilitated facilities.&#13;
3.22          Accordingly, the proposed project is designed not only to rehabilitate facilities but also&#13;
to upgrade them; simply to reinforce existing, less effective, less efficient, and unsafe systems and&#13;

CHAPTER 3                                                                                  21&#13;
facilities for delivery of care would be counterproductive. Moreover, the rehabilitated facilities would&#13;
serve as prototypes and stimuli for similar efforts beyond the immediate scope of the project.&#13;
3.23          This component is also designed to improve methodology and local capacity to invest in&#13;
medical facilities through: (a) developing an initial investment program in medical facilities in each oblast;&#13;
(b) establishing criteria for setting investment priorities in medical care; (c) developing a financial&#13;
mechanism for investment in Russian medical facilities in conjunction with the territorial health insurance&#13;
funds; (d) developing guidelines for functional designs for buildings; (e) identifying and providing&#13;
essential equipment; (f) training programs; and (g) developing guidelines for maintenance of facilities.&#13;
3.24          Annex 3.3 illustrates some of the common problems in both the structure and layout of&#13;
existing medical facilities and how the subprojects would serve as models. It is expected that this health&#13;
component would improve the quality of care by improving diagnosis and treatment which could reduce&#13;
the length of patient stays by as much as one-third.&#13;
Subproject Selection Criteria&#13;
3.25          An oblast investment program  would be initiated as part of project planning and&#13;
implementation. Within this program, Bank finance would be provided for selected parts of city and&#13;
raion hospitals that would qualify as general hospitals in western terminology, and polyclinics. WBF&#13;
would not finance specialized facilities, whether these are separate institutions such as maternity homes,&#13;
psychiatric hospitals, and tuberculosis hospitals, or specialized departments within general hospitals.&#13;
These hospitals are the mainstay of the system dealing with the majority of the population; outside the&#13;
main cities these hospitals, usually with an adjacent polyclinic, are normally the only medical facility&#13;
available to the population. As such these facilities deal with the main causes of morbidity and&#13;
(preventable) mortality: cardiovascular problems and trauma. Better functioning of these hospitals should&#13;
shorten the average length of stay of patients and reduce the need to refer patients to higher-cost oblast&#13;
hospitals. Moreover, this focus reduces the potential complexity of the project and facilitates replicability.&#13;
This does not, of course, imply that all specialized facilities should be abandoned or neglected, and where&#13;
their rehabilitation is undertaken in conjunction with loan-financed investments, such rehabilitation could&#13;
be financed as part of the oblast contribution to the Project.&#13;

CHAPTER 3                                                                                  23&#13;
3.26          The following criteria have been established for selecting facilities for the project, and&#13;
used to identify a preliminary list of subprojects!Y:&#13;
(a)    Centrally located and easily accessible hospitals serving at least 50,000&#13;
population (and which are expected to continue to serve at least this size&#13;
population in the foreseeable future);&#13;
(b)    Hospitals with high levels of utilization--i.e. an occupancy rate of above 90%;&#13;
(c)    Hospitals which are in need of rehabilitating and upgrading of their (i)&#13;
emergency-cum-admission units, including ambulances, (ii) intensive care units,&#13;
(iii) surgery theaters, (iv) laboratories, and (v) X-ray and imaging units;&#13;
(d)    Hospitals which are likely to have a high load of emergency patients in need of&#13;
intensive care;&#13;
(e)    Hospitals which have access to: water supply, heating, sewage, and electricity;&#13;
(f)    Hospitals that with improved functioning can reduce the need for beds both&#13;
within the hospital and in other facilities;&#13;
(g)    Hospitals that would not be classified as "structurally dangerous" by local&#13;
building codes;&#13;
(h)    Hospitals whose structures are most flexible in terms of layout and design for&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading (e.g. spread-out facilities are given priority over&#13;
narrow high structures); and&#13;
(i)    Hospitals whose management and staff are most amenable to adoption of new&#13;
technology and functional reorganization.&#13;
Polydinic Facilities&#13;
3.27          Priority among urban polyclinics would be for those which have the capacity, mainly in&#13;
space and location, to serve also as diagnostic centers for a network of 6-8 existing polyclinics, combining&#13;
to serve a population of about 300,000. The rationale for this criterion is that it would raise the level&#13;
of care in the community, and among other things, save on the need for hospitalization. Services in the&#13;
community would become more efficient because of a more rational allocation and use of expensive&#13;
equipment. Moreover, such facilities could attract qualified personnel to care in the community and&#13;
would serve as in-service training centers.&#13;
3.28          The selected rural polyclinics would normally be adjacent to (or part of) a raion hospital,&#13;
on which they depend for almost all services. They have consequently been regarded as part of their&#13;
respective hospital complex, and are subject to the above criteria set for hospitals. They would need to&#13;
be upgraded as diagnostic centers serving the hospitals as well.&#13;
3.29          Different polyclinic services may be ultimately privatized (or given an independent not-&#13;
for-profit status), turning the polyclinic into a medical center, housing different services under the same&#13;
roof, and sharing a variety of supporting administrative and other non-medical services. Thus, the design&#13;
of the rehabilitated units provides to the extent possible for their operation as self-contained administrative&#13;
and financial units.&#13;
16Y The rationale for selecting these subprojects is described in Annex 3.3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                                                 CHAPTER 3&#13;
Financial Mechanisms&#13;
3.30          The current system for determining and financing medical investments provides little&#13;
incentive to make efficient choices, and indeed can be positively distorting. For example, where hospital&#13;
budgets still depend on the number of beds and their occupancy, hospital boards cannot be expected to&#13;
make rational investment choices that would lead a reduction in the required number of beds. Efficiency&#13;
requires that investments should be made only if these bring in a reasonable return, and this can be most&#13;
easily achieved if investment decisions are made by provider institutions that can anticipate receiving this&#13;
return through a compensation system which includes the costs of capital in the basis for reimbursements.&#13;
The financing mechanism also should provide a system of inter-facility incentives with respect to provider&#13;
compensation. For example, the proposal to establish diagnostic centers serving a network of polyclinics&#13;
will only be successful if all concerned have an economic incentive to make it function.&#13;
3.31          To address these issues, an effort would be made to stimulate work with regard to a&#13;
reimbursement system, using project facilities as a pilot. As part of project planning and implementation,&#13;
a simple but fundamental investment mechanism for the health system would be developed as a prototype&#13;
and on a pilot basis. This would have three aspects:&#13;
(a)    appropriate budgetary and other payment mechanisms to providers who benefit&#13;
from the project;&#13;
(b)    loan repayment by providers; and&#13;
(c)    financing the additional recurrent operational costs that the rehabilitated facilities&#13;
would incur following project implementation on a declining basis.&#13;
3.32          With respect to (a), it is proposed to develop a system for budgeting raions on a capitation&#13;
basis, with an intra-regional equalization mechanism, and to develop alternative payment or&#13;
reimbursement mechanisms, such as diagnostic related groups (DRGs), to medical providers. With respect&#13;
to (b) an investment facility will be established within the Territorial Compulsory Health Insurance Funds&#13;
(TCHIF) as part of the projectL'.  This facility would become an extra-budgetary means to finance&#13;
investments in medical facilities, with the ability to mobilize funds from external sources, such as World&#13;
Bank loans, and would on-lend these, along with matching local funds, to medical facilities. The&#13;
facilities would then repay the loan from the revenues they receive from the TCHIF (either directly or&#13;
indirectly through "insurers") for services rendered to the population. These revenues would include&#13;
compensation for capital cost.L" The investment facility of the TCHIF would in turn repay the loans it&#13;
received, including liabilities to the oblast budget for matching funds. The oblast authorities may use this&#13;
mechanism for some or all of the health components of the project. Annex 3.4 discusses this mechanism&#13;
in greater detail. Preparatory work on these reforms in Novosibirsk has been assisted by USAID and the&#13;
proposed project would include local consulting services to assist with the development of different&#13;
financial mechanisms, and these would be piloted in Cherepanovo Central Raion Hospital.  At&#13;
Negotiations, it was agreed that these mechanisms and the subprojects to be included in the pilot would&#13;
be agreed with the Bank before implementation of the pilot begins, which would not be later than one&#13;
year after the date of effectiveness.&#13;
2'' The TCHIF, created under Federal Health Insurance legislation in 1993, are described in Annex 3.4.&#13;
LI See Chernichovsky, D. and Potapchik, E., "Needed financial mechanisms for implementation of the Russian&#13;
health insurance and health sector reform". (project files)&#13;

3.33           With respect to (c), potential savings in length of patient stay could more than&#13;
compensate for increases in running costs associated with upgrading (see Annex 3.3).&#13;
Training&#13;
3.34          A substantial training (study tours) sub-component is proposed. (For each facility in each&#13;
oblast, 5 trainees would participate in these tours (see Annex 3.3). This would include:&#13;
(a)    Physician training courses in use of laboratories and imaging units, in emergency care&#13;
and resuscitation and on use of referral protocols. (12-week course)&#13;
(b)    Training of architects and engineers (already under way as part of project preparation)&#13;
to develop and adopt standards and/or guidelines for such things as the layout of units&#13;
in the general hospitals and polyclinics; the functional relationships among units; the&#13;
minimal size of units; and the technical requirements to meet electro-mechanical needs&#13;
such as heating, electricity, air conditioning. (7-week course)&#13;
(c)    Training for laboratory technicians, imaging technicians and maintenance engineers and&#13;
technicians and administrative personnel. (7 week-course for each specialty)&#13;
Health personnel would also participate in training activities as part of the enviromnental strengthening&#13;
program (see Annexes 5.4 and 6.1).&#13;
Consulting Services&#13;
3.35   (a)    A total of 110 person-months of foreign and 475 person-months of local consulting&#13;
services would be provided for design and supervision of facilities.&#13;
(b)    The development of new financial mechanisms would require 16 person-months of&#13;
foreign and 56 person-months of local consulting services.&#13;
(c)    A total of 21 person-months of foreign consulting services would be provided to conduct&#13;
training and supervise study tours.&#13;
3. Water Supply and Sanitation ComponentL'&#13;
Summary&#13;
3.36          The component would be targeted mainly at the rehabilitation, refurbishment and renewal&#13;
of the existing infrastructure, including the rehabilitation of water mains to reduce leakage levels, the&#13;
refurbishment of chlorination installations to provide better security in drinking water disinfection and&#13;
the renewal of electrical and mechanical pumping machinery that has outlived its useful operating life.&#13;
In wastewater, the work would include the rehabilitation of existing sewerage networks, the provision of&#13;
new cesspit tanker vehicles to improve cesspit emptying and the renewal of electrical and mechanical&#13;
L9 Grant assistance for the preparation of this component was received from the U.K. Know-How Fund.&#13;

plant at key pumping stations. Where new construction is proposed, it would be limited to providing&#13;
facilities to enable more efficient use of the existing infrastructure. Individual subprojects would be&#13;
limited in size and scope, with a ceiling of about US$2.0 million each. Consultancy services and training&#13;
would be provided in all aspects of design, construction, operations, and institutional and financial&#13;
management of water and wastewater services.&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
3.37          The central objectives are to sustain and/or restore basic water supply and sanitation&#13;
services, and to the improve the technical and economic efficiency of the supplying entities.&#13;
Subproject Selection Criteria&#13;
3.38          Subproject proposals would comply with the long-term strategy for development of water&#13;
and wastewater services in the municipality. Specific criteria are:&#13;
(a)    Subprojects would be self-contained and would not rely on other works to secure the&#13;
envisaged benefits;&#13;
(b)    Where there are alternative technical feasible options, these would be subject to a net&#13;
present value (NPV) analysis, to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the options;&#13;
(c)    Municipalities would be required to demonstrate sustainability by showing that&#13;
requirements for trained personnel could be met either by present staff or through&#13;
training programs that they propose, and that the supply of consumables for operation&#13;
and maintenance are adequately budgeted;&#13;
(d)    Where the water company (vodokanal) or other enterprise is operating the assets of the&#13;
water and wastewater infrastructure on a license or rental agreement from the&#13;
municipality, there would be an agreement on the respective responsibilities for&#13;
maintenance and renewal of existing assets and the provision of new infrastructure (i.e.&#13;
extensions to the existing installations); and&#13;
(e)    The environmental impact would be acceptable.&#13;
Financial Mechanisms&#13;
3.39          At present, vodokanals generally estimate that enterprises pay the full costs of water&#13;
supply services, but that households are still subsidized. Under the housing reform law, these subsidies&#13;
are due to be removed by 2005. Consultancy services to assist in developing standards to carry out the&#13;
eventual achievement of full cost-recovery by the major vodokanals would be provided. As an interim&#13;
measure, operating entities need to demonstrate to the Bank that their income is sufficient to cover all&#13;
operating costs and a reasonable standard of maintenance. Corporatized vodokanals would be required&#13;
to provide annual accounts and financial projections. Where water supply services have not been&#13;
corporatized, the departments that provide them should maintain separate accounts for them. At&#13;
Negotiations, it was agreed that as a condition of eligibility for a subproject in the water sector, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                             CHAPTER 3&#13;
operating entity would be required to present a financial projection acceptable to the Bank that would&#13;
document (i) that its projected receipts (including budgetary subsidies) will be adequate to meet its costs&#13;
of operation and maintenance, and (ii) that its dependence on such subsidies will decline steadily and will&#13;
be eliminated by 2005. The institutional study (see below para. 3.42) would include a review of cost-&#13;
recovery policy, and this agreement would be reviewed in the light of the recommendations of that study.&#13;
Oblasts would be asked to confirm that as a condition of eligibility for a subproject in the water sector,&#13;
the operating entity will demonstrate that its revenue is sufficient to cover its costs of operations and&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
Training&#13;
3.40  (a) With regard to architecture and engineering: training would be include workshops for the&#13;
design of water supply and sewerage systems to western standards; design of water and wastewater&#13;
treatment plants; the design and construction of structural buried pipelines; capital works programming;&#13;
project planning and appraisal; competitive bidding procedures and the supervision of construction works.&#13;
(b) In operational management: training would be include workshops and study tours in water&#13;
demand management; leakage detection and control; asset management and planning and sewer and water&#13;
main surveys.&#13;
(c) For the construction aspects of subprojects: workshops are proposed for preparation of&#13;
specifications and bills of quantities; construction planning and scheduling and site management;&#13;
reinforced concrete construction and the constructional aspects of structural buried pipelines.&#13;
(d) On institutional aspects: training would be include workshops and study tours in management&#13;
and administration; operational control; financial management; water demand management including cost&#13;
recovery and water metering; asset management and planning and manpower planning.&#13;
A total of about 20 person-months of consulting services would be provided to carry out the above&#13;
training, which would include seminars and study tours, for both oblasts.&#13;
Consulting Services&#13;
3.41         The difficulties experienced in the management and operation of the water utilities in both&#13;
the rural raions and the city municipalities (Rostov and Novosibirsk) require that an institutional&#13;
preparation study be undertaken on an oblast-wide basis in each oblast requiring a total of 12 person-&#13;
months. The prime objective of the studies would be to examine the rationale for a reorganization of the&#13;
water/wastewater utilities so that rehabilitation of existing assets and future capital investments in&#13;
extension and improvement of the infrastructure can, in the long term, be afforded and sustained by&#13;
efficient management throughout the whole of each oblast. Initially, the institutional preparation study&#13;
would make an appraisal of the management and operation of the existing structure and activities of the&#13;
water/wastewater services in each oblast. Following a preliminary report with recommendations, the&#13;
study would then be continued and would focus on the problem areas identified. Particular aspects to&#13;
be reviewed include water demand management; asset management planning; cost recovery; capital&#13;
investment planning and revenue budgeting and cost control. During project preparation, discussions&#13;
were held with the oblast and city municipalities and their respective vodokanals and in both oblasts there&#13;
is a willingness to cooperate in undertaking the institutional study described.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 3                                                                             29&#13;
3.42         Institutional development of the vodokanals and their respective design institutes would&#13;
be carried out in close collaboration with the Water Sector Study to be carried out by the EC3&#13;
Infrastructure, Energy and Environment Division and the Black Sea Environmental Initiative to ensure&#13;
a unified approach. This is particularly important where an oblast is common to two or more projects.&#13;
Institutional training programs would be addressed through a combination of training courses, studies and&#13;
secondments. They would include contributions to the environmental action plan for the Azov Sea&#13;
(Rostov), environmental audit workshops, management courses and study tours. Some of the training&#13;
activities took place during project preparation partially financed by the Black Sea Environmental&#13;
Program (BSEP). Support from this source is expected to continue and grant financing is being sought.&#13;
The institutional program also includes studies which would contribute to improving the financial and&#13;
administrative structure of the agencies,  budgetary and cost control, manpower planning and&#13;
privatization. During the early stage of implementation, missions to each oblast would include an&#13;
institutional specialist from the Water Sector Study, and at the appropriate time supervision of this&#13;
component may be subsumed under the Water Sector Study, as least as far as Rostov is concerned. This&#13;
would ensure full coordination of the content, timing and direction of institutional strengthening prografns&#13;
for both projects. (See also Annexes 5.4. and 6.1).&#13;
4. Budget and Expenditure Management Component&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
3.43         Consulting services would be provided to assist oblast and raion governments to improve&#13;
budgetary management and expenditure. This would include the development of a computerized Model&#13;
Budgeting System and improvements in fiscal relations between the oblast and raion governments. The&#13;
results would be used to reform budgetary and expenditure management processes for social expenditures.&#13;
This work would be closely coordinated with the introduction and monitoring of pilot financing reforms&#13;
to be introduced as part of the health component (see para. 3.32) and outlined in Annex 3.4.&#13;
Rationale&#13;
3.44         Annex 1.3 includes a discussion of budgetary processes at oblast level. Intra-oblast fiscal&#13;
relations are currently a function of negotiated budgeting, based on a set of traditional norms and&#13;
dominated by past allocations. The formats in which budgets are presented are inadequate as "stand-&#13;
alone" transparent documents. Sufficient detail is not requested, and it is not feasible to prepare detailed&#13;
reports manually without errors. This creates the appearance of many gray areas in the budget which&#13;
are not clearly justified, and therefore, are subject to arbitrary cuts by the oblast. Meanwhile, raions&#13;
reallocate money provided by the oblast for targeted programs to other programs without requesting&#13;
approval from the oblast on a timely basis. The timeliness of requesting approvals can be greatly&#13;
improved by an automated process.&#13;
3.45         In addition to reformed budgetary mechanics, reforming expenditure policies requires an&#13;
analysis of options for reducing, preferably eliminating, subsidies of all types, and placing greater reliance&#13;
on user-charges and/or privatization of service provision etc. For expenditures that remain a budgetary&#13;
responsibility, there need to be clear rules as to which level of government carries the responsibility.&#13;
Budget decisions should greatly reduce and preferably eliminate the use of traditional expenditure norms,&#13;
and should find other ways to ensure that the implications of investment for future recurrent expenditures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                                                              CHAPTER 3&#13;
are considered before investments are approved. On the revenue side it is necessary to analyze and&#13;
present options for ways to increase local revenues, for example, land and property taxes. More&#13;
transparent transfer mechanisms to redistribute revenues to poorer raions, which would also provide a&#13;
greater incentive to better budgetary management at the raion level, need to be developed. Mechanisms&#13;
are required to protect the poorest raions against a collapse of services if revenues decline dramatically.&#13;
An appropriate borrowing policy needs to be established.&#13;
Swnmary Description&#13;
3.46          Assistance would be provided with respect to the following:&#13;
(a)    Local revenues: Identify those local taxes which have significant potential and&#13;
prepare for their introduction and administration; formulate financing and cost&#13;
recovery strategies for public services for which charges are to be levied;&#13;
formulate policies for the use of borrowed funds;&#13;
(b)    Budgetformulation: Develop budgetary forecasting models which enable the&#13;
oblast to test the probable effects on revenues and expenditures of alternative&#13;
economic assumptions and policy strategies; consolidate budgets to encompass&#13;
all financial transactions at the sub-national level, including those relating to&#13;
extra-budgetary funds; review and improve procedures for drawing up annual&#13;
budgets; develop a medium-term financial programming system;&#13;
(c)    Expenditure management/budgetary control:  Devise adequate means of&#13;
controlling and monitoring expenditure and revenues against budget&#13;
allocations/targets, including systems of regular financial management reports,&#13;
supported by appropriate formal financial regulations. Implement controls on&#13;
restricted account for expenditures like utilities and seasonal expenditures.&#13;
Review self-governance legislation to possibly change expenditure authority based&#13;
on expenditure items and sub-national government; and,&#13;
(d)    Review social expenditure policy with a view to identifying areas of budgetary&#13;
expenditure for which expenditure authority might be decentralized, or wholly&#13;
privatized, or made in some way more efficient. (See Annex 3.4 on Health&#13;
Financing for a discussion of reforms that would be piloted under this project.)&#13;
3.47         The hardware component comprises 50 computers, network equipment and software in&#13;
each oblast (10 for each city or raion). System requirements are presented in Annex 3.6.&#13;
Public Finance Training&#13;
3.48          A training workshop for one week, for government budgeting and financial reporting&#13;
would be included in this component in each oblast. The course would be designed and presented by&#13;
practitioners and professors. Theory would be the first segment of the course, and followed with case&#13;
studies developed and led by practitioners. In addition, a one-month study tour is planned for about 15&#13;
financiers in each oblast.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 3                                                                                31&#13;
Consulting Services&#13;
3.49          A total of 44 person-months of consulting services would be required to complete this&#13;
component in both oblasts. About 192 person-months of local consulting services would be included for&#13;
both oblasts.&#13;
5. Monitoring and Evaluation Component&#13;
3.50          Annex 3.7 lists performance indicators for the project objectives as a whole and for each&#13;
of the three sectors. Responsibility for such routine monitoring--i.e., for collecting the data listed in the&#13;
third column of the Table of Indicators--would be that of the Project Bureau in each oblast. At&#13;
Negotiations. the Government and the oblasts confirmed their acceptance of these performance indicators&#13;
as the basis for routine monitoring. In addition there would be Consultants' reports and regular&#13;
supervision of the budget and expenditure management component. The Central Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (CPIU) in Moscow, reporting to the MINNAT would oversee an annual report on the project.&#13;
Causes of delays and actions to accelerate implementation would be identified by the Project Bureaus in&#13;
consultation with the CPIU.&#13;
3.51          Since this would be the first World Bank project with investments in any type of social&#13;
infrastructure in Russia, as well as representing several other innovations in implementation processes,&#13;
evaluation both of the process of project implementation and of its impact is extremely important.&#13;
MINNAT would have responsibility for recruiting academic institutions in each oblast to collaborate in&#13;
designing and implementing a series of studies to ensure that the experience of each oblast could be&#13;
evaluated on a comparative basis. Advice from foreign academics or consulting firms with experience&#13;
in the design, implementation and analysis of similar work elsewhere would be drawn on. The broad&#13;
objectives would be to assess: (a) what could be improved in the implementation of the on-going project,&#13;
and (b) lessons for the design of future projects.&#13;
3.52          The evaluation would be based on structured interviews with stakeholders. Policy makers&#13;
and implementors, such as mayors, deputy governors, politicians and financial officers in the oblast, raion&#13;
and city administrations, would be interviewed with respect to the overall shape of the project. Questions&#13;
to these stakeholders would include: Is there evidence that the sectoral mix of subprojects was very&#13;
different from what might have prevailed if there had been no constraints? What would be the results&#13;
if similar projects in the future offered a different or a wider menu to communities? What would have&#13;
been the consequence of changing the terms on which communities received finance for subprojects? Are&#13;
there any continuing constraints to wider community participation in project design?&#13;
3.53          Sector-specific stakeholders such as oblast and raion officials in charge of health,&#13;
education and water supply, school authorities, parents, hospital staff and patients in specific subprojects&#13;
would be interviewed concerning what they considered to be most important among selection criteria for&#13;
subprojects, and the extent to which these had been met, and component-specific questions designed to&#13;
complement routine measures of output in assessing the outcomes listed in the fourth column of Annex&#13;
3.7. They would also be asked to evaluate the preparation period (too long/short, use of preparation&#13;
funds, adequacy of consultation with stakeholders, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                                                               CHAPTER 3&#13;
3.54          Jointly with the CPIU, the oblast Project Bureaus would organize a Mid-Term Project&#13;
Review prior to December 31, 1998. It would endeavor to draw preliminary conclusions from the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation with respect to the future operation of the project and it would offer an&#13;
opportunity for the oblasts to exchange their experiences and possibly learn from each other. It would&#13;
give specific guidance on: (a) the selection of the unidentified component; (b) whether the project&#13;
management structure should be continued in its present form; (c) whether implementation procedures&#13;
have been developed that might usefully be adopted for other oblast investments; (d) implications of the&#13;
findings of the budgetary and expenditure management component, and health financing innovations, for&#13;
future fiscal and financial practices in the oblasts and raions; and (e) what, if any, measures might be&#13;
needed to ensure project sustainability. It would summarize the lessons for replicability of the project&#13;
to other oblasts.&#13;
6. Preparation of Future Projects&#13;
3.55          It is anticipated that, if the project results are regarded as successful, this project would&#13;
be followed by others of a similar type. A follow-on project might focus on oblasts contiguous to&#13;
Novosibirsk and Rostov, to maximize these oblasts' capacity to absorb the lessons from this project. (It&#13;
might also widen competition among design firms and contractors.) Close proximity of project oblasts&#13;
would also simplify supervision. The project includes US$1.25 million for consulting services to&#13;
facilitate the preparation of a second project. This component would be administered by the CPIU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Administration at the Federal Level&#13;
4.1          The Federal Government's responsibilities would be exercised by the Ministry of&#13;
Nationalities and Federal Affairs (MINNAT), through a Central Project Implementation Unit (CPIU)&#13;
which would have oversight and coordination responsibility for the administration of the project, and&#13;
would be responsible for ensuring that the Agreement between the Government and the World Bank&#13;
would be carried out in an efficient and effective manner. A Project Bureau (PB) established in each&#13;
oblast would have the responsibility for the implementation of those subproject components contained in&#13;
their respective subsidiary agreements. The Project Preparation Unit, established with financing from&#13;
a Japanese Grant (No. TF025243, dated November 2, 1994) would be expanded into a central juridically&#13;
independent unit (CPIU). Directors of these units have been nominated and approved by the Bank. At&#13;
Negotiations, the Government submitted to the Bank for its approval the Draft Charter of the CPIU&#13;
(which will serve as a model for the two PBs) and the further steps necessary for the legal establishment&#13;
of these three units were agreed. The Government also provided assurances that the CPIU and the PBs&#13;
would be adequately staffed and maintained throughout the project implementation period. A Condition&#13;
of Loan Effectiveness would be the legal establishment of the CPIU, and the appointment of its Director&#13;
and key staff.&#13;
4.2           The MINNAT's responsibilities would include:&#13;
(a)    Establishment and Chairmanship of an Inter-Ministerial Working Group. Membership&#13;
includes relevant Federal Ministries--Education, Health, Construction, Environment,&#13;
Economy and Finance. The Group's focus would be a technical one. It would discuss&#13;
proposed methodological and financial innovations, review reports on the progress of the&#13;
project, and help to disseminate any useful lessons that can be derived from activities in&#13;
each sector or for the preparation of similar projects.&#13;
(b)    Project Administration. The CPIU would maintain a Special Account (for eligible&#13;
expenditures under WBF) and ensure timely replenishment of subsidiary Project Accounts&#13;
in each oblast. It would oversee the work of the finance sections of each PB. It would&#13;
establish an appropriate financial accounts system to provide information on the proper&#13;
receipt and use of funds in accordance with the Loan Agreement. It would also&#13;
coordinate training programs. A CPIU architect or engineer would review civil works&#13;
documents, ensure consistency across oblasts and assist the oblast technical units with&#13;
problem-solving, training and identifying specialists where required.   A  CPIU&#13;
procurement specialist would monitor the procurement activities of oblast PBs, provide&#13;
advice where required and assist the evaluation of bids for works and goods and the&#13;
selection process for consultant services, as appropriate.&#13;
(c)    Monitoring and Evaluation. Activities would include: (i) submitting semi-annual progress&#13;
reports to the Government and the World Bank on implementation progress including&#13;
works in progress, procurement of goods and services, and disbursements by each oblast&#13;
(based on data from the local PBs); (ii) organizing (jointly with oblast PBs) a mid-term&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                                                CHAPTER 4&#13;
review (see para 3.54); (iii) contracting special studies of project benefits, to be carried&#13;
out by Russian and foreign experts; (iv) preparation of an Implementation Completion&#13;
Report; and (v) initiating requests on the Government's behalf for Bank review, should&#13;
modifications in the project design be required.&#13;
(d)    Representation on the Advisory Board in each oblast. The MINNAT would monitor&#13;
decision-making, and the overall effectiveness of project implementation.&#13;
(e)    Assisting Replication of the Project in other oblasts. Activities would include: (i) the&#13;
development of a Project Manual as a starting point for similar activities elsewhere in&#13;
Russia. This would be based on the Operational Manuals that will be developed by the&#13;
two PBs; (ii) soliciting interest in the project's methods and achievements from other&#13;
oblasts; and (iii) administering project preparation funds for these oblasts.  At&#13;
Negotiations, the Government confirmed that the Project Manual would be submitted to&#13;
the Bank for its review no later than September 1998.&#13;
B. Project Administration at the Oblast Level&#13;
4.3           Implementation of specific components as set forth in the Subsidiary Loans would be the&#13;
responsibility of Novosibirsk and Rostov Oblasts. To carry out this work, a PB and an Advisory Board&#13;
(NAB and RAB) would be established in each oblast, as a condition of effectiveness of the Subsidiary&#13;
Loan Agreements.&#13;
Project Bureau&#13;
4.4           Each Project Bureau would report directly to a First Deputy Governor. It would have&#13;
an independent juridical status, free from oblast regulations limiting numbers of oblast employees, and&#13;
allow for adequate pay to attract qualified and highly motivated personnel. The PBs would be established&#13;
initially for three years. At the Mid-Term Project Review (para. 3.54), a decision would be taken on&#13;
whether to merge its functions as a part of the administration organization or to maintain its separate&#13;
status. Incremental operating costs, including office facilities, of the PBs has been included in the WBF&#13;
Project cost and eligible expenditures may be reimbursed from the proceeds of the Loan.&#13;
4.5           Each Project Bureau would have three sections. The PB Implementation Sections would&#13;
include an architect, an engineer, a site specialist, and one to three junior staff. These staff would be&#13;
trained in all aspects of World Bank procurement procedures and would be assisted by a procurement&#13;
specialist.it' It would oversee all technical aspects of implementation, and would represent the oblast in&#13;
any formal contracts. They would be required to meet periodically with the clients, such as local sectoral&#13;
departments and the directors of facilities selected for rehabilitation. The PB staff would normally&#13;
determine whether it would attend particular meetings between clients and designers or contractors, but&#13;
would be required to do so if requested by the client or consultants. This section would work closely&#13;
with a Finance Section which would be responsible for maintaining an account in a local bank (the Project&#13;
Account) to be periodically replenished from the Special Account, for eligible WBF Project work, and&#13;
t" Training of Preparation Unit Staff has been given by The Crown Agents in Moscow (with assistance from&#13;
the U.K. Know-How Fund), and new Bureau staff would receive similar training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 4                                                                              35&#13;
into which the oblast would make its budgetary contribution to the project. This section would be&#13;
responsible for establishing an acceptable accounts system which would be audited on an annual basis.&#13;
It would be responsible for ensuring prompt payment to locally-based contractors and/or other appropriate&#13;
payments. It would be thoroughly familiar with World Bank disbursement procedures and auditing&#13;
requirements.&#13;
4.6           Each Project Bureau would also contain a Planning Section. The Section, which would&#13;
include a senior specialist in project evaluation and preparation and an assistant, and would draw on the&#13;
staff of sectoral departments and local consultants where needed, would oversee the selection of staff for&#13;
the design of subprojects. It would be responsible for ensuring that clients actively participate at the&#13;
design stage of subprojects. This section would also organize the collection of data required for the&#13;
measuring of outputs listed in Annex 3.7 on Performance Indicators. It would also be responsible for&#13;
developing the Operational Manual into a document that would serve future needs in the oblast, and&#13;
would assist the CPIU to develop a more general Project Manual to use for replication in other oblasts.&#13;
It should provide this document to the CPIU not later than September 1997.&#13;
4.7          A major part of the work of the Planning Section, beginning in the second year of the&#13;
project, would be the appraisal of a new set of subprojects to be proposed by the oblast sectoral&#13;
departments. At Negotiations, the Government confirmed that: (i) the basis for their selection and&#13;
appraisal would be the selection criteria as set out in Annexes 3.1, 3.3 and 3.5 (possibly modified in the&#13;
light of experience and agreed with the Bank); (ii) a list of these subprojects, sufficient to complete the&#13;
utilization of the loan, would be available for discussion at the mid-term project review scheduled for&#13;
about June 1998, and would be reviewed at that time, or earlier, by the Advisory Board; and (iii) detailed&#13;
design of each subproject would not begin until an appraisal report on it had been reviewed by the Bank.&#13;
At Ne2otiations, the Government also confirmed that except with the agreement of the Bank, these&#13;
proposals would ensure that: (a) no more than 40% or less than 25% of the Loan funds would be&#13;
allocated for any one sector; and (b) not more than 50% of the loan in each sector would be for&#13;
subprojects in the administrative capital of each oblast.&#13;
4.8          Each PB would be advised by an internationally-recognized consulting firm, to be selected&#13;
by the oblast authorities in accordance with agreed procedures. The consulting firm would provide an&#13;
engineer, an architect and a procurement specialist who would be stationed in the each oblast, with the&#13;
ability to call on other specialized advisors from the selected firm as might be required. It is anticipated&#13;
(although not required) that such firm or firms would form a joint venture with a Russian firm, and would&#13;
ensure that the standards adopted in every facet of WBF are consistent with those as set forth in the Loan&#13;
Agreement and to the extent practicable also for NBF. As a part of any joint venture, expatriate&#13;
specialists would train their local counterparts in international procurement and financial procedures,&#13;
including those of the World Bank and in addition would provide an independent review on the technical&#13;
aspects of the project, these specialists would:&#13;
(a)    provide training and advice to ensure that designs are of high standard and bidding&#13;
documents conform with agreed World Bank guidelines, where required;&#13;
(b)    provide assistance with the procurement process as may be required; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                                              CHAPTER 4&#13;
(c)    make periodic site visits to ensure that implementation of the subprojects involving civil&#13;
works are being carried out efficiently and effectively and to provide an independent&#13;
verification of progress of each subproject.&#13;
4.9           The training and advisory program would include training of architects, engineers, civil&#13;
works contractors, site supervisors and the clients in order to involve the clients in an active role to&#13;
ensure that the work is satisfactorily carried out as set forth in the subproject agreements.&#13;
The Advisory Boards&#13;
4.10          Each Advisory Board would meet on a regular basis (at least twice a year) to review the&#13;
progress of implementing the project. Its role would be strictly advisory, without formal votes, and its&#13;
views would be non-binding. Accurate records of its discussions of subprojects would, however, be&#13;
maintained and used by decision-makers in guiding the selection of future subprojects. The Board would&#13;
be chaired by the First Deputy Governor. It is expected that the majority of its members would be&#13;
prominent local citizens. The MINNAT would be represented on the Board. Meetings would be attended&#13;
by senior oblast officials concerned with their particular sector and by the Director and senior staff of&#13;
the PB.&#13;
4.11          While its meetings would be private, regular press conferences would be held to&#13;
disseminate their outcomes, and to foster public awareness and understanding of the project and of the&#13;
benefits that it provides to its citizens. In Novosibirsk, the Board members have been selected and the&#13;
in Rostov oblast, the selection process is underway. At Negotiations, it was agreed that meetings of the&#13;
Advisory Boards would be held at least twice each year until the Mid-Term Review.&#13;
4.12          Each oblast may decide whether to ask its Advisory Board to review and comment on the&#13;
initial subproject list. Because of the progress that has already been made in preparing these subprojects,&#13;
it would not be expected that this discussion would lead to any changes but this discussion could affect&#13;
and improve the criteria used for future subprojects. Each Board would receive the list of subprojects&#13;
to be financed from the unidentified portion of the project before the mid-term review, so that its&#13;
comments would be available to the Bank at the time of the review.&#13;
Project Supervision&#13;
4.13          World Bank Supervision missions would monitor all aspects of project implementation&#13;
along with the CPIU and the PBs to ensure due diligence of the Borrower in achieving the objectives of&#13;
the project. In particular, WBF would be reviewed for compliance with the Loan Agreement. Review&#13;
would include, inter alia, the monitoring of procurement activities, contract management, and record-&#13;
keeping, and use of the Special Account. Budgetary provision for adequate funds in the Health sector&#13;
for recurrent costs (incremental operating costs) financed under WBF would also be carefully reviewed.&#13;
Project Launch workshops would be undertaken in both Novosibirsk and Rostov Oblasts on or about June&#13;
1996, and a Mid-Term Review (see para. 3.54) would be undertaken prior to December 31, 1998. Upon&#13;
completion of the project, an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be prepared. All activities&#13;
would place special emphasis on the procurement progress and financial reporting.&#13;
4.14          The consultants to each PB would visit each subproject site regularly, and would report&#13;
their findings to MINNAT and to the Bank via the CPIU as a part of periodic progress reports. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 4                                                                             37&#13;
consultants would also carry out prior review of all proposed subprojects in order to streamline and&#13;
accelerate the Bank's review process. However, as this project is the first of its kind in Russia and&#13;
comprises three sectors, inter alia, about 29 weeks and two supervision missions are anticipated in FY&#13;
1997, with 20-35 person-weeks and two missions in each FY through 2002 followed by a mission in&#13;
FY2003 to discuss an ICR of the Project (Annex 4.2).&#13;
Flow of Funds, On-Lending and Repayment Arrangements&#13;
4.15   Except for the funds provided directly to MINNAT, proceeds from the Bank Loan would be on-&#13;
lent to the two participating oblasts. On-lending arrangements would be reflected in Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreements between the Ministry of Finance and the two oblasts. (This agreement would also include&#13;
a Schedule setting out the implementation obligations of each oblast.) Each oblast would be responsible&#13;
for repaying 50% of the funds provided to it. The repayment period would be 12 years including a three&#13;
year grace period. Interest paid by the oblasts will be at a rate which is not more than 2.5% above the&#13;
rate charged by the Bank on the Loan. Payments by each oblast would include its share of the Laon&#13;
committment fee.  The present state of macroeconomic instability makes it impossible to devise&#13;
appropriate ruble-based terms, and so repayment obligations would be denominated in US dollars.&#13;
Repayment obligations would be small in relation to the current budgets of the oblasts, and in relation&#13;
to the budgets that might be reasonably expected at the end of the Bank Loan grace period (see Tables&#13;
4R and 4N in Annex 1.3). A Condition of Loan Effectiveness would be the effectiveness of at least one&#13;
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Ministry of Finance and an oblast that reflect these terms and&#13;
obligations. A Condition of Disbursement to any oblast would be the effectiveness of a Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement between Ministry of Finance and that oblast.&#13;
4.16         Financial arrangements between oblasts and raions have been agreed in principle, but&#13;
details still need to be determined. Each Oblast Administration would be responsible for paying the&#13;
budgetary cash contribution of 10% of WBF subproject costs into the project account maintained by the&#13;
PB in advance of disbursements from that account. At Negotiations, the Government confirmed that each&#13;
oblast would make its budgetary cash contribution of 10% of WBF subproject costs into a Project&#13;
Account on a schedule to be agreed annually with the Bank in advance of anticipated disbursements.&#13;
4.17   Repayment obligations by beneficiary administrations and organizations would need to differ&#13;
according to their revenue capacities, but oblast officials agree that it is desirable that all beneficiaries&#13;
of the project recognize that the World Bank Loan has to be repaid. This should increase a sense of&#13;
ownership of project facilities and encourage future maintenance. In the case of budget-financed&#13;
subprojects (such as all the education subprojects), it is feasible for the budgets of major major&#13;
municipalities to assume the entire repayment and debt service obligations of the oblast incurred for that&#13;
subproject. In contrast, the budgetary expenditures of many raions already exceed their entire tax&#13;
revenues by very large amounts and they have little opportunity under current Russian law and practice&#13;
to increase these revenues. For these repayment obligations should be smaller, but nevertheless should&#13;
not be less than 10% of their share of the loan. Even if the effect of this small amount is merely to&#13;
increase the implicit subsidy from the oblast it is important that the investment not be regarded as an&#13;
entirely free gift, and it is also possible that a later reform to the system of property ownership and&#13;
taxation may change the revenue situation of such local governments, so that they can develop some&#13;
repayment capacity. Repayment obligations would therefore vary depending on the revenue situation of&#13;
the beneficiary agency. These obligations would be reflected in sub-loan agreements between the oblast&#13;
and the beneficiary. At Negotiations, the Government confirmed that sub-loan agreements would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                                                            CHAPTER 4&#13;
signed between the oblasts and the beneficiary agency before beginning to implement any subproject&#13;
(except where work has already begun as part of project preparation).&#13;
4.18         For education subprojects, the beneficiary agency would be a local government&#13;
department. This may also be the case for some of the health subprojc. However, for at least some&#13;
health subprojects a proposed pilot financial mechanism described above (para. 3.32) and in detail in&#13;
Annex 3.4 would, for the purposes of the loan, replace the local health department with the Territorial&#13;
Compulsory Health Insurance Fund (TCHIF). For these subprojects the TCHIF would on-lend the&#13;
proceeds of the loan to providers, and would itself be repaid by adjustments in the payments it makes to&#13;
these providers. Eventually the TCHIF would be responsible for repayment of such loans from the&#13;
revenues of medical facilities.  In the water supply and sanitation sector, there are corporatized&#13;
vodokanals (water and sanitation public utilities) in the principal cities that are organized as public&#13;
corporations, for which cost-recovery is scheduled, by law, to be completed by year 2005. These entities&#13;
would be required to make full repayment to the oblast. However, most raions operate water systems&#13;
through small government departments, which have only limited possibilities of cost-recovery, and their&#13;
obligations would need to be substantially lower.&#13;

V. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
Summary of Project Costs&#13;
5.1    Total Project Cost is estimated at US$288.1 million which is composed of WBF (IBRD Loan plus&#13;
Government cash contribution and applicable duties and taxes) and NBF (financed by the Government&#13;
on a parallel basis). The summary of costs by components is shown in Table 5.1 and a summary of&#13;
project costs by category of expenditure for WBF is shown in Table 5.2.  Annex 5.1 (Tables 1-13)&#13;
contains additional details of project costs, including a cost breakdown by oblast and the CPIU.&#13;

Basis of Cost Estimates&#13;
5.2             The costs for Civil Works, Goods (equipment, vehicles and supplies) and Services,&#13;
including local and overseas training have been based on current prices and recent fees paid in similar&#13;
projects financed by the Bank and other donor agencies in the Russian Federation. Costs for foreign&#13;
consultants have been estimated on the basis of the cost of fees, accommodation and subsistence in the&#13;
Russian Federation and include salaries, housing, subsistence, transportation, translation and interpretation&#13;
services, and miscellaneous fees. Base cost estimates reflect prices in March 1996.&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER 5                                                                             41&#13;
Foreign Exchange Component&#13;
5.3          For WBF, the foreign exchange component was estimated as follows: (a) Civil Works-&#13;
18%; (b) Goods (equipment, vehicles, and supplies), an average of 43%; and (c) Consulting Services:&#13;
foreign consultants-100%; local consultants and local training-O%; and overseas training and study tours-&#13;
100%. The foreign exchange component WBF is estimated at US$86.8 million (39% of total WBF, net&#13;
of duties and taxes).&#13;
Contingency Allowances&#13;
5.4          For WBF, physical contingencies representing about 6% of the base cost of the project&#13;
were based on an allowance of 15% for civil works and 5% for goods and services. Price contingencies&#13;
represent about 3 % of the base project cost plus physical contingencies. Project costs and contingencies&#13;
are estimated in US dollars only, based on World Bank forecasts that after 1996 the differences between&#13;
domestic and international inflation would be offset by frequent changes in the exchange rate and, that&#13;
changes in the country's general price level will match expected annual increases in international prices.&#13;
Annual international inflation rates used are as follows: 1997, 3.8%; 1998, 3.0% 1999, 2.5%; 2000,&#13;
2.3%; 2001, 2.5%, 2002, 2.0%, and 2003, 2.0%. In making these estimates, it is recognized that in&#13;
countries which have severe price inflation and have not yet completed a very major economic&#13;
adjustment, there is a serious danger of inflation of domestic costs in dollar terms. If price contingencies&#13;
are inadequate, the number of unidentified subprojects that can be financed from the loan would have to&#13;
be reduced.&#13;
Custom Duties and Taxes&#13;
5.5    WBF would be subject to duties and taxes estimated at US$40.7 million equivalent. These&#13;
estimates are based on an estimated 20% tax (VAT) levied on all local contracts for civil works and&#13;
goods. For imported goods (equipment, vehicles, materials and supplies), an average of 20% of the&#13;
estimated cost has been used to calculate customs duties (this average percentage is based on recent duties&#13;
paid by foreign firms for similar type of works and goods). Salaries of local consultants include 41 %&#13;
health and unemployment insurance and pension contribution. Project costs include an average of 30%&#13;
personal income tax on local consulting services. For foreign consultants, it is anticipated that due to the&#13;
short term assignments (less than 183 days per annum), local tax would not be applicable. Customs&#13;
duties and taxes were not calculated for the unidentified subprojects under either WBF or NBF.&#13;
B. Project Fincing&#13;
5.6    The proposed Loan of US$200.0 million would finance 90% of the cost of WBF net of duties&#13;
and taxes. The oblast administrations would finance US$24.2 million (10% of WBF) in cash and&#13;
US$40.69 million equivalent representing duties and taxes expected to be levied on the WBF. The Loan&#13;
would finance 100% of the foreign exchange cost and about 82% of local costs for the project, excluding&#13;
duties/taxes. NBF represents about 8% of the total project (WBF &amp; NBF) of which the Government&#13;
would finance 100%. Table 5.3 details the proposed financial arrangements.&#13;

Retroactive Financing&#13;
5.7           Retroactive financing up to US$15.0 million (8% of the Loan Amount) for works, goods&#13;
and services procured after March 1, 1996, under WBF, would qualify for retroactive financing provided&#13;
that payments would be for expenditures eligible under the Loan Agreement and that procedures for&#13;
procurement for Works, Goods and Services, and processing and clearance comply with the Bank's&#13;
Procurement and Use of Consultant Guidelines.  Documentation for expenditures claimed under&#13;
retroactive financing would be the same as those for disbursement against payment made after the Loan&#13;
Agreement is signed. The Executive Directors were originally notified through the Monthly Operational&#13;
Summary dated January 2, 1996. The purpose is to ensure that pilot subprojects would be implemented&#13;
during the 1996 building season.&#13;
Incremental Operating Costs&#13;
5.8           WBF includes the financing of incremental operating costs for: (a) the Health sector&#13;
consisting of consumable goods (supplies) required to operate diagnostic and imaging equipment to be&#13;
provided under WBF (US$23.8 million excluding duties and taxes; these consumables would be partially&#13;
financed by the IBRD); (b) the CPIU (US$0.75 million); and (c) the two PBs (US$0.62 million each) for&#13;
office rent and supplies, training materials, maintenance of office equipment, communications (including&#13;
international telephone calls and facsimile transmissions), and vehicle operation and maintenance.&#13;
Recurrent Cost Implications and Sustainability&#13;
5.9           Numerous proposed subprojects would result in cost-saving to the entities involved,&#13;
especially in Water Supply sector, as discussed in Chapter VI, and in Annexes 3.3 and 3.5. In the Health&#13;
component, it is anticipated that cost-savings measures would require several years to achieve measurable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 5                                                                            43&#13;
results, and therefore, some addition recurrent costs would be created. This is not expected to add any&#13;
undue burden on the budgetary allocations of the agencies receiving assistance under the project. Another&#13;
element in sustainability is the continuation of new implementation practices. This would be supported&#13;
by the implementation of Government-financed subprojects in the later years of the project.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
Implementing Agencies&#13;
5.10         The CPIU would monitor and have oversight responsibility for all procurement activities,&#13;
inter alia, of the PBs while the oblast's PBs would have the primary responsibility for the procurement&#13;
under their portion of the project. They would be responsible for the procurement of goods and services&#13;
financed under the CPIU, including the supervisory engineer and the medical procurement consultant&#13;
(para. 5.24). The CPIU would also be responsible for the preparation of a proposed follow-up project.&#13;
5.11         The Project Bureaus in Rostov and Novosibirsk oblasts would be responsible for project&#13;
coordination, including procurement, in their respective oblasts, together with Departments of Education,&#13;
water and health, of the oblast, municipality or raion where procurement would take place. The&#13;
procurement of some water supply and medical equipment, benefitting institutions in both oblasts, would&#13;
be coordinated between the two Project Bureaus.&#13;
Suummary of Procurement Procedures&#13;
5.12         WBF. All civil works, goods and services to be financed under WBF would be procured&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines-Procurement under IBRD Loans and Credits", dated January&#13;
1995 and "Guidelines-Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency", dated August, 1981. Standard Bidding Documents for Works, Goods, Supply and Installation,&#13;
Information Systems, Computer Systems, and Form of Contracts (Services) issued by the Bank would&#13;
be used to the extent practicable and as appropriate for the works, goods, specialized medical equipment,&#13;
computers, MIS, and services to be procured. Civil works, goods and services would be grouped to the&#13;
extent practicable to encourage competitive bidding. Major project elements, their estimated costs and&#13;
proposed methods of procurement summarized in Table 5.4 and Annex 5.3 contain a detailed procurement&#13;
plan and schedule of identified subprojects.&#13;

5.13         NBF. For civil works, goods and services to be financed in parallel under NBF (not&#13;
Bank-financed), the various Government agencies involved would be encouraged to follow the same&#13;
procurement procedures as required under WBF, although this would not be a mandated requirement&#13;
under this Loan/Project.&#13;
Unidentiried Project Components&#13;
5.14         WBF includes financing for subprojects (civil works and goods), not yet identified,&#13;
estimated at US$44.8 million (17% of total WBF). Procurement under these subprojects would follow&#13;
procurement procedures established for similar identified subprojects financed under WBF. The proposed&#13;
methods of procurement for the unidentified subprojects would be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
Procurement of Civil Works (VVBF)&#13;
5.15         Civil works under WBF are estimated at US$131.7 million equivalent of which US$102.2&#13;
million (78% of civil works under WBF) represents the identified works and the balance of US$29.5&#13;
million representing civil works to be identified.&#13;
5.16         Civil works under WBF would be grouped in packages that would encourage international&#13;
competition, while at the same time taking into account the scattered locations, the need to carry out the&#13;
work without disrupting ongoing operations, and extreme climatic conditions (i.e., the relatively short&#13;
Russian construction season, which only extends from April to September in the Novosibirsk area-&#13;
somewhat longer in the Rostov area), all influencing the various starting dates and packaging. Award&#13;
of contracts for bid packages combining subprojects would be based on the lowest evaluated bid on&#13;
individual subprojects contained in the package or the lowest evaluated combined bid for all subprojects&#13;
contained in the package. Annex 5.3 details the proposed procurement plan and includes the packaging&#13;
and timetable for civil works in the identified subprojects.&#13;
5.17         Civil works consisting of both new and rehabilitated works would be procured utilizing&#13;
the methods described below. Civil works not yet identified would follow procurement procedures&#13;
established for identified civil works and such procedures (including packaging) would be subject to prior&#13;
review by the Bank.&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (pCB) procedures would be utilized for civil works&#13;
estimated to cost US$2.0 million equivalent and above for a total of about US$73.1&#13;
million (56% of total civil works). Included are two bid packages estimated to cost&#13;
between US$1.0 million and US$2.0 million, for the installation of chlorination systems&#13;
in Novosibirsk and for installation of specific water supply equipment in Rostov,&#13;
involving installation techniques and equipment not available in Russia. Fourteen&#13;
separate bid packages are planned under ICB for the identified subprojects.&#13;
(b)    National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
para. 3.3 and 3.4 of the Guidelines would be permitted for the procurement of civil&#13;
works that cannot be grouped in packages above US$2.0 million, for a total of about&#13;
US$58.6 million (45% of total civil works). Such works are more suitably procured&#13;
under NCB due to the works' scattered location over a large geographical area making&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                                                                             CHAPTER 5&#13;
it unlikely that international contractors would be interested in bidding. Thirty-one&#13;
separate bid packages are planned under NCB for the identified subprojects.&#13;
5.18         To encourage participation of the local construction industry and to familiarize local civil&#13;
works contractors in the competitive type bidding process, inter alia, the staff of the CPIU and the PBs&#13;
would carry out short training courses to firms who express interest in bidding (para. 4.7). Local&#13;
contractors are expected to participate in bidding on the subprojects in various bid packages. Annex 1.2&#13;
provides an overview of the structure and capacity of construction enterprises in both Novosibirsk and&#13;
Rostov Oblasts and concludes that there should be no difficulty in obtaining effective local competition&#13;
in the bidding for civil works under the project.&#13;
Procurement of Goods (WBF)&#13;
5.19         Goods (US$98.4 million) consisting of equipment (computers, other office equipment,&#13;
medical equipment and supplies, electrical and mechanical equipment for water supply and sanitation&#13;
sector; vehicles; etc.) would be procured utilizing the following methods of procurement. All lists of&#13;
goods and proposed grouping for procurement purposes would be subject to review by the Bank.&#13;
Identified goods represent about US$83.6 million (85%). Goods to be identified represent the balance&#13;
of US$14.8 million (15%). A schedule and packaging of goods for the identified subprojects is contained&#13;
in Annex 5.3. Goods not yet identified would follow procurement procedures established for identified&#13;
goods and such procedures would be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be utilized for goods estimated&#13;
to cost US$96.5 million (98% of total goods) for contracts above US$300,000 equivalent&#13;
each, and for vehicles (except cesspit emptying vehicles), regardless of their value.&#13;
Twenty-nine bid packages are planned under ICB for the identified subprojects, including&#13;
two contracts for supply of health sector consumables for operation of 11 health facilities.&#13;
(b)    National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
para. 3.3 and 3.4 of the Procurement Guidelines would be permitted for the procurement&#13;
of goods that cannot be grouped in packages above US$300,000 equivalent. This would&#13;
include such items as office equipment. NCB procurement would be permitted up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$1.0 million (about I % of total goods). Four bid packages are&#13;
planned under NCB for the identified subprojects&#13;
(c)    Natfional Shopping (NS) procedures for contracts up to US$50,000 equivalent each may&#13;
be used for locally available, off-the-shelf items of small value and standard&#13;
specifications, mainly office supplies, up to an aggregate amount of US$0.5 million. In&#13;
addition, the procurement of cesspit emptying vehicles estimated at US$0.8 million would&#13;
be procured using NS due to their specialized technical requirements and the need for&#13;
compatibility with existing equipment. In accordance with para. 3.5 and 3.6 of the&#13;
Guidelines, at least three price quotations from qualified suppliers would be required.&#13;
(d)    Direct Contracting (DC) procedures, in accordance with para. 3.7 of the Procurement&#13;
Guidelines, would be permitted for the procurement of proprietary medical equipment,&#13;
supplies and spare parts, yet to be identified, with prior approval of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 5                                                                               47&#13;
Preference for Domestically Manufactured Goods&#13;
5.20          Contracts for Goods for WBF to be awarded on the basis of ICB, the Borrower may, as&#13;
set forth in the Loan Agreement, grant a margin of preference of up to 15% or the amount of applicable&#13;
customs duties, whichever is lower, to qualified domestic manufacturers of goods in accordance with&#13;
World Bank Procurement Guidelines (January 1995). Where appropriate, the technical specifications of&#13;
the equipment would be specified and the procurement packages would be designed so as not to preclude&#13;
domestic manufacturers from competing. It is anticipated that Russian suppliers and/or manufactures&#13;
would be competitive for the supply of goods.&#13;
Consulting Services (WBF)&#13;
5.21          WBF would include funds for about 37 person-years of international consultants (US$11.2&#13;
million) and about 350 person-years for local consultants (US$16.2 million) which would involve, inter&#13;
alia, project implementation support consisting of: design, supervision, procurement, auditing and other&#13;
studies, including preparation of a proposed follow-up project as contained in Annex 5.3. Draft Terms&#13;
of Reference (TOR) have been prepared (see Annex 5.4).&#13;
5.22          Consultants would be hired on terms and conditions (including review  of their&#13;
qualifications) in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the&#13;
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency", dated August 1981, and Standard Forms of Contract, where applicable, would be utilized.&#13;
5.23         Individual consultants to the CPIU and the two PBs previously hired under the Japanese&#13;
Grants may be considered for further consultancy under the project where this would be more efficient&#13;
and effective than any alternative. Retention of the services of these consultants would require prior&#13;
review by the Bank on a case-by-case basis.&#13;
5.24          Architectural and engineering (A/E) services for the preparation of detailed designs of&#13;
civil works, and supervision of construction of schools; water assets; hospitals; and clinics would be&#13;
grouped into packages which, because of their size, would be attractive for international consulting firms&#13;
to submit proposals. Such international firm(s) would be encouraged (although not required) to enter into&#13;
joint ventures with national A/E firms. From time to time specialized assistance would also be required&#13;
in the Health component for the preparation of procurement documentation for medical equipment and&#13;
supplies.&#13;
Training (WBF)&#13;
5.25          For overseas training and study tours (US$4.0 millon) and local training (US$1.7 million)&#13;
financed under WBF (total of US$5.7 million), the qualifications of candidates along with their course&#13;
of study, proposed training institutions and costs, and in-country local training courses would be subject&#13;
to prior review by the Bank. Staff would be selected on the basis of established criteria, to be agreed&#13;
upon with the Bank as part of the annual reviews. Details of the proposed training are contained in&#13;
Annex 5.3.&#13;
5.26         The Project Bureaus would organize workshops for all interested contractors on the&#13;
methodology of completing bidding documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48                                                                           CHAPTER 5&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF)&#13;
5.27         A PPF of US$1.5 million (Agreement Letter P275-0-RU, dated November 20, 1995) was&#13;
granted to the Russian Federation to finance further preparation of the Project (WBF) and would provide&#13;
funds for: (a) Consulting Services to assist in the design of (i) two health facilities, (ii) three water supply&#13;
and sanitation facilities, (iii) an educational management system, and (iv) the establishment of the two&#13;
Project Bureaus and the Central Project Implementation Unit; and (b) For the procurement of (i)&#13;
equipment to support to an educational Management Information System, and (ii) leak detection&#13;
equipment to enable engineers to complete designs of improvement to the water and sanitation&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
Notification of Business Opportunities&#13;
5.28         A General Procurement Notice (GPN) would be published in the UN publication&#13;
"Development Business" and, as appropriate, would be updated and published annually thereafter. For&#13;
civil works and goods to be procured through ICB, individual bidding opportunities would also be&#13;
advertised in one or more major local newspapers 30 days prior to availability of bidding documents and&#13;
transmitted to potential bidders who expressed an interest in bidding. These local advertisements would&#13;
be in the English and Russian language. The local advertising procedures would be repeated for all&#13;
bidding packages using NCB. These advertisements would be in the Russian language.&#13;
Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions&#13;
5.29         Scheduling of Procurement. Prior to the issuance of any invitation for bidding, the&#13;
proposed procurement plan (Annex 5.3) for the project (WBF) would be reviewed by the CPIU and the&#13;
PBs and the Bank advised of any proposed modifications for its review in accordance with the provisions&#13;
of para. I of Appendix I of the Procurement Guidelines of January 1995. Procurement of all works,&#13;
goods and services would be undertaken in accordance with the agreed procurement plan which would&#13;
adjusted as appropriate and included as a part of the semi-annual report and would be subject to Bank&#13;
review.&#13;
5.30         Prior Bank review:&#13;
(a) Civil works and goods. Prior review of the bidding documents for civil works and goods,&#13;
including review of evaluations and recommendations for award of contracts, would be carried out for&#13;
all procurement utilizing ICB procedures. For NCB, all bidding documents above US$1.0 million&#13;
equivalent; and (b) all documents and recommendations involving direct contracting would require prior&#13;
Bank review. Accordingly, about 75% (by value) of procurement transactions would be subject to prior&#13;
review by the Bank. Master list of goods to be procured would also be subject to prior review by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
(b) Consultants. Terms of Reference for all consulting assignments would be subject to prior&#13;
Bank review.  Terms and conditions of contracts, invitation packages and evaluation reports of&#13;
assignments costing more than US$50,000 each for individual consultants, and US$100,000 each for&#13;
firms would be subject to prior review by the Bank. All documents and recommendations involving sole&#13;
source selection of consultants would also be subject to prior review. Accordingly, about 80% (by value)&#13;
of these transactions would be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 5                                                                             49&#13;
5.31         Post Review. In respect to each contract not covered by the above would be carried out&#13;
in accordance with para. 4 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines for Procurement, dated January 1995 and&#13;
would also be reviewed during the Bank's project supervision missions.&#13;
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)&#13;
5.32         A CPAR for the Russia Federation is currently being discussed with the Government and&#13;
is expected to be issued about June 1996. For this proposed project, the Borrower would follow agreed&#13;
procurement procedures (in accordance with Bank Guidelines) as described above and as set forth in the&#13;
Loan Agreement.&#13;
D. Disbursement&#13;
Schedule&#13;
5.33         The proposed Loan would be disbursed over a period of six and one-half years which&#13;
includes six (6) months for finalization of accounts and submission of withdrawal applications. The&#13;
method of disbursement and schedule, shown in Tables 5.5 and 5.6. The Project is expected to be&#13;
completed by June 30, 2002, with a Loan Closing Date of December 31, 2002.&#13;
5.34         Disbursement procedures would be in accordance with those described in the&#13;

5.36         Disbursements would be fully documented except for items costing less than US$50,000&#13;
equivalent where certified Statements of Expenditures (SOE) would be used with payment from the&#13;
Special Account. Disbursement/procurement documents using SOE procedures would be retained by the&#13;
CPIU for a period of at least two (2) years after disbursement and made available to Bank staff and to&#13;
auditors.&#13;
Special Account&#13;
5.37         To facilitate payments of small and medium size amounts in foreign currency and all&#13;
payments in local currency, the CPIU would open and maintain a Special Account in US dollars in a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to IBRD. The selection process and criteria would follow the Bank's&#13;
standardized procedure. The maximum authorized allocation of the Special Account would be US$15.0&#13;
million. The initial amount to be deposited at the beginning of disbursements would be US$5.0 million.&#13;
This amount would be increased to the maximum authorized allocation once cumulative disbursements&#13;
have reached US$20.0 million. The allocation to the Special Account would be replenished on the basis&#13;
of satisfactory documentary evidence, to be provided to IBRD by the CPIU, of payments made from the&#13;
account for works, goods and services required for WBF. In addition, monthly bank statements of the&#13;
Special Account, which have been reconciled by the CPIU, would accompany all replenishment&#13;
applications. Payments not made through the Special Account, either through the issuance of special&#13;
commitments or direct payments to suppliers, would be at a minimum US$50,000. The CPIU would be&#13;
responsible for monitoring any funds from this special account which would be transferred to the PB's&#13;
Project Accounts, which would be in commercial banks acceptable to the IBRD, and replenishment&#13;
procedures, etc., as outlined above would apply.&#13;
E. Reporting&#13;
Semi-Annual Reports&#13;
5.38         Semi-annual progress reports covering all components would be prepared by the CPIU&#13;
and sent to the World Bank within one month of the end of each six (6) month period (i.e., by end-July&#13;
and end-January). The format would be mutually agreed upon prior to the date of the first submission&#13;
and would be modified as necessary during the implementation of the project. The purpose of the reports&#13;
would be to provide managers with timely information on implementation of projects components and&#13;
lesson learned. The CPIU would set up reporting guidelines and deadlines for the receipt of information&#13;
from the PBs in each oblast, in order to prepare the report. The first report would be issued before the&#13;
first World Bank supervision mission. The reports would include, inter-alia:&#13;
(a)  progress achieved against agreed implementation and disbursement schedules, and key&#13;
performances indicators;&#13;
(b)  the status of all contracts with special attention given to procurement activities;&#13;
(c)  work programs and proposed expenditures for the coming quarter;&#13;
(d)  status of compliance with covenants and major agreements under the Project;&#13;
(e)  description of issues and problem areas along with recommended corrective actions;&#13;
(f)  description of progress in resolving previous problems and addressing earlier recommendations;&#13;
and&#13;
(g)  status of the Special Account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52                                                                           CHAPTER 5&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR)&#13;
5.39         The CPIU would prepare an ICR upon completion of the Project and in any event not&#13;
later than six (6) months after final disbursement of the Loan Proceeds. Included in the ICR would be&#13;
an assessment on the execution and initial operation of the project, costs and benefits derived or to be&#13;
derived, the performance of the Borrower, the Bank and other agencies involved in the project regarding&#13;
their respective obligations and accomplishments, and including lessons learned. The ICR would include&#13;
plans for the future operation of the facilities which had been financed under the project, including the&#13;
indicators for monitoring and evaluating future operations.&#13;
Accounts and Auditing&#13;
5.40         The CPIU would be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the funds provided&#13;
under the loan and by the Borrower, would maintain consolidated accounts for the project and would&#13;
prepare monthly financial reports, and would ensure that audits of the financial statements or reports are&#13;
timely submitted to Bank. Accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all other project-&#13;
related accounts would be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. Project&#13;
accounts, including the Special Account, maintained by the CPIU would be audited annually in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by&#13;
the World Bank", dated March 1982.&#13;
5.41         For WBF, audits would also be carried out at the same time and for corresponding&#13;
periods, in accordance with Bank's guidelines, for SOEs against which disbursements have been made&#13;
or are due to be made from the loan and SOEs which would be included in the audit reports&#13;
accompanying the financial statements. The audited financial statements for the Special Account, project&#13;
accounts, and SOEs of the preceding fiscal year and the resulting audit report in such scope and detail&#13;
as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements made&#13;
against certified statements of expenditure, would be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the&#13;
Government's fiscal year. Funds to carry out the audits have been included in WBF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
Benefits&#13;
6.1           The proposed project would meet an immediate and urgent need to preserve and improve&#13;
essential community services that are fundamental to social well-being. So far, subprojects accounting&#13;
for 75% of WBF have been identified:&#13;
(a)    The education subprojects so far identified include rehabilitation of 34 schools, expansion&#13;
and rehabilitation of four schools, and three new schools.  Benefits from  these&#13;
subprojects include improvements to the learning environment, which should be safe,&#13;
hygienic, and warm in the bitter winters. School closings (because of heating and water&#13;
and sanitation failures) would be averted and instruction would not be interrupted.&#13;
Improvements to school design should improve pedagogical effectiveness. Education&#13;
subprojects already identified would provide such benefits for a total of about 40,000&#13;
pupils, and it is anticipated that several additional schools would later be identified for&#13;
upgrading in the later years of the project.&#13;
(b)    Health subprojects so far identified include the rehabilitation and upgrading of four&#13;
polyclinics and seven hospitals to benefit a total combined catchment population of about&#13;
1.5 million. Imminent closing of medical facilities because of unsafe structures would&#13;
be avoided, preventing a decline in access to care of people in their catchment areas.&#13;
Patients of upgraded facilities would receive higher quality and clinically more efficacious&#13;
and appropriate care as a result of better diagnostic and medical testing capacity. It is&#13;
estimated that the length of hospital stay would decline from an average of 17 days to an&#13;
average of 9-12 days (see Appendix to Annex 3.3).&#13;
(c)    Sixty-two water and sanitation plant rehabilitation subprojects have been identified. The&#13;
estimated beneficiary population for the identified is approximately one million in each&#13;
oblast. Benefits include the assurance of safe water and sanitary facilities, and improved&#13;
efficiency through the reduction of leakages.&#13;
6.2           The method of analysis carried out to ensure that all subprojects are individually justified&#13;
from an economic perspective is explained below, and illustrated through model appraisals for subprojects&#13;
in each sector (presented in Annexes 3.1, 3.3 and 3.5).&#13;
6.3           This project would also demonstrate important innovations in the efficiency of use of&#13;
public resources:&#13;
(a)   the process of determining regional and local expenditure priorities and subproject&#13;
selection would improve;&#13;
(b)    design improvements and better construction quality, and commitment of beneficiaries&#13;
to future maintenance in the selected subprojects would provide models for replication&#13;
elsewhere in the oblast and in other parts of Russia;&#13;
(c)    new methods of public procurement of goods and services would lead to cost-savings;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54                                                                                              CHAPTER U&#13;
(d)     pilot programs in education facilities planning and health financing would lead to more&#13;
efficient resource use in these sectors, also on a replicable basis; and&#13;
(e)     new systems of management of budgetary expenditure would be developed.&#13;
6.4              The project would also foster private sector development by promoting competition among&#13;
engineering and architectural firms and competitive bidding by private construction companies. Lastly,&#13;
the project would contribute to a sense of local ownership of, and responsibility for, social infrastructure,&#13;
and contribute to the Russian Government's policy of decentralization.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
6.5              Only the benefits of the project arising from  the individual subprojects can be readily&#13;
quantified. No attempt is therefore made to try to aggregate all the benefits from the project. As with&#13;
all Bank projects, the economic appraisals serve to reduce the risk of accepting subprojects that are cost-&#13;
ineffective, or benefit only very few peopleA'. Each subproject would therefore be subjected to separate&#13;
economic appraisal, and is expected to show a positive present value when its benefits and costs are&#13;
discounted using a 15% discount rate.&#13;
6.6              Benefits are calculated by estimating cost-savings resulting from the project rather than&#13;
trying to maintain the service in alternative ways. No attempt is made to put an monetary evaluation on&#13;
the services themselvesL'. In some cases, the alternative might be no service at all--for example, where&#13;
a facility might have to be closed if it is not rehabilitated. The only alternative to rehabilitation would&#13;
be a new facility-'. In others, there would be unacceptably poor quality or dangerous services--for&#13;
example, in facilities with inadequate sanitation or without water. Another possibility might be growing&#13;
repair costs and declining services for some limited period, and then the need to replace the asset at a&#13;
21/ Note that while the cost per beneficiary household or individual may be an indicator of priority, there would be no&#13;
suggestion that this should be minimized for the project as a whole. The result might be a concentration of subprojects&#13;
in urban areas, which might not only be politicafly unacceptable, but also would limit other project benefits, such as&#13;
improved government expenditure policies, to unnecessarily few places.&#13;
r For projects providing basic health and education services, it is normaly impossible to measure the streams of benefits&#13;
and costs in comparable ways--i.e. in terms of monetary flows. Although for certain education projects-those whose&#13;
objectives are relatively narrow training ones-it may be possible to measure a high proportion of the benefits in terms of&#13;
increased labor productivity of the beneficiaries, improved earnings are only one of the reasons why countries have&#13;
compulsory general education, and there is also no way to measure how such education affects earnings in countries&#13;
where it has been virtually universal for decades. While it sometimes may be possible to estimate the life-saving effects&#13;
of alternative health investments, it is not possible to express these in monetary terms. In water supply and sanitation&#13;
projects, there is greater interest in "willingness to pay" as an indication of benefits, but since many of the benefits are&#13;
health benefits and are not confined to the beneficiary household, such a measure can at best be partial.&#13;
The alternative of leaving the population without the service at all is not considered. For example, it has long been&#13;
Russian policy to make nine years of general education free and compulsory, and to provide two further years almost&#13;
universally (except to those students who attend vocational schools) and few would argue that this policy should be&#13;
abandoned. Similarly, there is universal access to polyclinics and to the lower levels of the hospital pyramid, and the&#13;
project's focus on core services that will continue to be provided free of charge to the user, is also not likely to be&#13;
disputed. The benefits to the population of clean water and sewage facilities are also not in dispute, and as noted,&#13;
Russia has now imposed user charges which are intended to rise progressively until they eliminate household subsidies&#13;
by year 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER 6                                                                                       55&#13;
higher future cost. A rehabilitation project is therefore "service-preserving" or "cost-saving" rather than&#13;
service-increasing.&#13;
6.7            The school rehabilitation subproject in Novosibirsk used as a basis for the model appraisal&#13;
illustrates the analysis. Without rehabilitation the school has little or no useful life, and it is assumed that&#13;
it would have to be closed in 3 years if not rehabilitated. This would mean that students would have be&#13;
transferred to two schools 8 and 12 km away, which would incur significant transport costs. This travel&#13;
is subsidized, both directly and through fuel subsidies, so there would be a difference in projected&#13;
economic and financial costs. There would be some small addition to maintenance costs in the alternative&#13;
schools. In addition, since both schools already operate two shifts, this alternative would entail a decline&#13;
in the quality of education, as well as higher recurrent costs. The alternative of building a new school&#13;
cannot yet be justified, although it is expected that in about 10 years an increase in school-age population&#13;
would justify the increase.&#13;
6.8            The cost-savings that arise in health are more complex. In one hospital for which a&#13;
detailed appraisal has been completed, it is anticipated that the improvements would enable the hospital&#13;
to operate with one-third fewer beds, and could lead to closing 256 of the present 770 beds in the system,&#13;
amounting to an annual saving of over US$800,000. Similar savings are likely to result from many of&#13;
the upgraded health facilities. Simulating on a system-wide basis--assuming that length of stay can be&#13;
reduced by 30%  and the number of beds by 35%, and 10% of patients currently treated in hospitals&#13;
would be able to be treated on an outpatient basis instead--would imply annual savings of approximately&#13;
US$5 million in a catchment area of 300,000. These benefits can be supplemented by an estimate of&#13;
health benefits to households, expressed in terms of years of life savedl'.&#13;
6.9            Evaluation of the rehabilitation of the water supply subprojects has much in common with&#13;
the education subprojects. Without the project operational, maintenance and environmental costs would&#13;
rise over time. (Environmental costs and benefits are difficult to measure and the analysis uses as a&#13;
proxy the penalties for non-compliance which are already being levied but which would rise substantially&#13;
in the absence of the project.) The model appraisal shows that the present value of these additional costs&#13;
of operating the facility in the absence of the project is greater than the present value of the capital costs&#13;
of the subproject plus the slight increase over current operating costs that the subproject would require,&#13;
when these are discounted at 15%.&#13;
6.10           Cost estimation is difficult in Russia, and the Bank and other foreign agencies have found&#13;
that estimates of civil works have frequently turned out to be underestimates. Where plausible, recent&#13;
comparative Russian estimates could not be found, European cost levels have been assumed. There seems&#13;
no need to depart from market prices either for labor or for tradable goods. The exchange rate no longer&#13;
seems very much undervalued; World Bank forecasts are that the ruble will appreciate about 10% in&#13;
1996, and thereafter will retain the same real relationship to international exchange rates. There is&#13;
therefore no longer a case for expecting a major increase in money wages in dollar terms. There is&#13;
growing unemployment, especially in Novosibirsk, but open unemployment remains below 10%, so there&#13;
M The model appraisal in health shows the very large potential for saving life, especially between ages 15 and 60.&#13;
Attempting to measure the specific health consequences of an individual subproject where such a high proportion of&#13;
health problems reflect behavioral, environmental or other factors beyond the control of an individual institution would&#13;
be excessively speculative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56                                                                                        CHAPTER b&#13;
is no case for using a shadow price for labor. On the other hand, there is plenty of capacity in the local&#13;
construction industry (see Annex 1.2) so there is no need for concern that the project might drive up&#13;
construction labor costs. With respect to tradables, Russia's price liberalization and relatively low&#13;
domestic protection make it unnecessary to perform cost-analyses using other than domestic prices. This&#13;
appears to be true even for energy, so long as industrial rather than household prices are used.&#13;
Social Beneits&#13;
6.11           The Project is designed to introduce stakeholder participation through the involvement&#13;
of all levels of government as key actors at all stages of the project cycle, and through the participation&#13;
of several non-governmental representatives on oblast Advisory Boards. One of the most important roles&#13;
of the Advisory Boards is to discuss and influence the selection of subprojects for the unidentified portion&#13;
of the loan. Although it is more costly per beneficiary to renovate rural schools, hospitals and water and&#13;
sanitation plants because of lower population densities, but subprojects clearly should not be concentrated&#13;
in urban areas for reasons of equity. Cities are likely already to be relatively favored because of a better&#13;
fiscal position, and because schools and health facilities already benefit from their capacity to find&#13;
sponsors among prosperous enterprises and affluent users or parents. The direct benefits of the project&#13;
should be well distributed over the oblast populations; similarly, the long-run benefits of improved&#13;
government expenditure policies and procedures should be widely spread over the two oblasts.&#13;
6.12           Local participation would be particularly important in relation to future maintenance and&#13;
sustainability. School Boards, which include parents, teachers, and senior pupils, already organize&#13;
programs of winterization, painting, clearing rubble and delegating to parents, teachers and school&#13;
children the task of completing it, using both voluntary labor and monetary donations.21' As a condition&#13;
of final approval of the subproject, the Board would be asked to make a formal commitment to&#13;
maintaining the facility and to describe how this would be organized. For subproject schools, Directors&#13;
together with selected Board members and a representative of the local administration would form a&#13;
construction committee to represent the client interest in the construction process. Workshops would be&#13;
held to introduce the staff of raion sectoral departments, headmasters, and representatives of teachers and&#13;
parents to key aspects of subproject implementation, and their own responsibilities26'.&#13;
6.13           Hospitals are currently managed by a hospital board headed by a chief doctor and heads&#13;
of departments in the facility. The Boards take decisions on the maintenance of the facility in consultation&#13;
with the local administration and to a lesser extent solicit the views of patients through patient satisfaction&#13;
questionnaires. However, in Novosibirsk oblast, there are plans to establish a Guardian Council&#13;
comprising the chief doctor, his first deputy, city administration officials and chiefs of some state and&#13;
private companies. The aim would be to educate the public on environmental and hygiene issues, and&#13;
generate enthusiasm in the private sector to contribute funds to the maintenance and modernization of&#13;
2' In one subproject (School No. 30 in Novosibirsk), out of approximately Rb5O million needed for maintenance in 1994,&#13;
about RblO million were given by the city Department of Education and a similar amount was collected from the&#13;
parents. In another school in Rostov (School No. 34) also included in the project, out of a similar amount needed for&#13;
maintenance in 1994, parents contributed about Rb30 million in cash and kind (labor), and the rest was drawn from the&#13;
raion budget. Schools in urban areas have been able to attract sponsorship from state enterprises and the military&#13;
industrial complex. However, in some areas, the level of contribution has dropped due to shutting down of these&#13;
enterpises.&#13;
E Such workshops have already been held as part of project preparation of the education component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER 0                                                                              57&#13;
hospitals. For hospitals, the role of Board and/or Guardian Council would be as described for the School&#13;
Boards above.&#13;
Future Selection of Subprojects&#13;
6.14         Oblast sectoral departments would be expected to consult with city and raion officials in&#13;
developing a list of proposed new subprojects for the unidentified component of the project, which would&#13;
be reviewed by the Advisory Board. These need to meet the agreed sectoral selection criteria. An annex&#13;
to the draft Operational Manual suggests procedures that might be followed, but these are not the only&#13;
possibility.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
6.15         The project is classified in Category B. Major environmental concerns have been&#13;
identified and addressed for the known and pre-appraised/appraised subprojects of the three project&#13;
components. The environmental aspects of the rehabilitation work of hospitals and schools (health and&#13;
education components) concern generally the use of non-hazardous building and insulation materials, the&#13;
proper disposal of building materials and old equipment and materials, proper management of medical&#13;
and solid waste, adequate storage and handling of pharmaceutical and chemical products and proper&#13;
indoor and outdoor safety of the facilities and its systems. In general, the environmental concerns of the&#13;
water and sanitation component of the project are related to: poor potable water, water availability,&#13;
leakage and loss of water, lack of water and wastewater treatment capabilities, lack of treated water&#13;
storage facility, inadequate storage and handling of chemicals, sewage flooding and sludge management&#13;
and disposal. Water leakage has the secondary effect of undermining building foundations and causing&#13;
structural damage. Environmental analyses with enhancement and mitigation measures have been carried&#13;
out for known subprojects as part of pre-appraisal/appraisal reports (see Annexes 3.1, 3.3 and 3.5). In&#13;
conformity with Bank and Russian requirements, detailed environmental guidelines and procedures have&#13;
been developed in the Operational Manual for subprojects not yet identified or appraised. These&#13;
procedures are intended for the use of the Project Implementation Unit and Bureaus, the Regional and&#13;
Local Environmental Committees, the Applicants and the regional/local Design Institutes.&#13;
6.16         In addition, the project has developed an environmental institutional strengthening&#13;
program which includes three subcomponents: institutional support, training, and environmental studies&#13;
(see Annex 6.1). Some of the training activities took place during project preparation, partially financed&#13;
by the Black Sea Environmental Program (BSEP). Support from this source is expected to continue, and&#13;
additional grant financing is being sought.&#13;
6.17         The project would have an important positive environmental impact in the three&#13;
components as it would: (a) improve overall hospital and school conditions and waste and system&#13;
management in these facilities; (b) facilitate access to water supply and sanitation; (c) reduce&#13;
environmental damage to underground water supplies and rivers; (d) augment wastewater and water&#13;
treatment and management capacities; (e) improve potable water quality; (f) reduce health risks; (g) limit&#13;
losses of treated water from leakage and pipe failures; (h) reduce environmental degradation of the Black&#13;
Sea through improvements in the Rostov wastewater and water systems; and (i) strengthen institutional&#13;
capacities through training and better knowledge of environmental conditions and management practices.&#13;

58                                                                              CHAPTER 0&#13;
Risks&#13;
6.18          A multi-sectoral project in two oblasts suggests that a major risk would be excessive&#13;
complexity that could impede implementation. To reduce this risk, the project has sharply limited the&#13;
range of eligible subprojects within each sector. The project would introduce new methods of subproject&#13;
selection and implementation but is doing so in a phased manner, beginning during the preparation phase.&#13;
The project itself would begin with the implementation of preappraised subprojects. During preparation,&#13;
training is being provided on methods of appraisal, design and implementation of model subprojects.&#13;
6.19          An alternative risk is that in the interests of rapid implementation, the longer term benefits&#13;
to the project in changing the way subnational administrations do business would be neglected, so that&#13;
after the project is completed, reliance on top-down direction and norm-based allocations would return.&#13;
To reduce this risk, a strong emphasis has been placed on local ownership and participation. Although&#13;
initial responsibility for project implementation at the oblast level would be given to a PIU that is not part&#13;
of the regular administrative structure, the Mid-Term Project Review would focus on ways to ensure that&#13;
the proven methods of implementation and other lessons from the project are gradually transferred into&#13;
the regular programs of the oblast. Similarly there may be a reversion to construction methods that speed&#13;
up subproject completion at the expense of construction quality, higher future maintenance costs, and&#13;
shorter life of the facility. To reduce this risk, there would be extensive training of architects, engineers,&#13;
site supervisors and clients, and regular supervision by consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
7.1    At Negotiations, agreements were be reached, or assurances given, as follows:&#13;

Review. Detailed design of each subproject would not begin until an appraisal report on&#13;
it had been reviewed by the Bank (para. 4.7).&#13;
(i)    Except with the agreement of the Bank, the selection of this new set of subprojects would&#13;
ensure that: (i) not more than 40% or less than 25% of the Loan funds would be&#13;
allocated for any one sector; and (ii) not more than 50% of the loan in each sector would&#13;
be for subprojects in the administrative capital of each oblast (para. 4.7).&#13;
(j)    Meetings of the Advisory Boards would be held at least twice each year until the Mid-&#13;

(a)    The legal establishment of the CPIU and the appointment of its Director and key staff&#13;
(para. 4.1).&#13;
(b)    The effectiveness of at least one subsidiary loan agreement between the Ministry of&#13;
Finance and a participating oblast (para. 4.15).&#13;
7.3    A Condition of Disbursement to any oblast would be:&#13;
(a)    The effectiveness of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Ministry of Finance and&#13;
that oblast (para 4.15).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
7.4          Subject to these agreements and conditions, the proposed project would be eligible for&#13;

ANNEX 1.11'&#13;
THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN NOVOSIEBIRSK AND ROSTOV OBLASTS&#13;
A. NOVOSIBIRSK OBLAST&#13;
1.     Novosibirsk Oblast, located in the southeast of the western Siberian plain, has a total area of&#13;
69,600 square miles and a population of 2.80 million. The oblast developed rapidly in the late 19th&#13;
century because of the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway. The city of Novosibirsk is at a&#13;
junction of several railroads, and also has two airports and a river port. The region is not as rich in&#13;
natural resources as the other parts of Siberia, but nevertheless, there are coal deposits in the south, oil&#13;
and natural gas deposits in the north, and numerous sources of mineralized water are available. The city&#13;
of Novosibirsk is the largest scientific, industrial, cultural, and administrative center in Siberia. About&#13;
70,000 students study in the city's 16 universities, and in various academies and institutes.&#13;
2.     Of the oblast's total population of 2.80 million, 2.05 million (74%) live in towns. However, in&#13;
1991, as in other parts of Siberia, the negative migration toward rural areas changed to positive for the&#13;
first time since 1960-65. Until 1991, the oblast had been losing its people to other regions of Russia and&#13;
the former Soviet Union. In 1991, the migration balance changed in the oblast's favor and was&#13;
responsible for 56% of the total increase in the population.&#13;
3.     The oblast's mortality rate rose during 1989-93, with life expectancy decreasing by 4 to 5 years&#13;
for men and more than 2 years for women. At the same time, birth rates decreased dramatically and the&#13;
number of abortions per thousand women of reproductive age increased, even in comparison with the&#13;
high figures of the mid-1980s. As a result, the 1994 birth rate was only 7 to 9 per thousand in urban&#13;
areas and 9 to 11 per thousand in rural areas.&#13;
Trends in Industry and Agriculture&#13;
4.     The oblast's major sphere of production is industry, especially machine building, light industry&#13;
and the food industry. The military industrial complex dominates industry in the oblast, which has one&#13;
of Russia's highest concentrations of military production facilities. However, this industry has suffered&#13;
greatly as demand for its products fell sharply and no financing was available for comprehensive&#13;
conversion to civilian enterprises. In 1991-93 the output of military products fell by two-thirds and their&#13;
share in the oblast's overall industrial output was halved. Currently, 19 major enterprises are being&#13;
converted.&#13;
5.     The decline in civil production has not been as dramatic. Production of consumer goods was&#13;
30% less in 1993 than in 1991 because demand dropped through a fall in incomes and increased&#13;
competition for inputs. Some of the more significant declines in output since 1990 have been in the&#13;
medical industry (70%), the ferrous metals industry (65%), and the chemical industry (60%). The&#13;
T his annex is based on material prepared by Mr. V. Silvestrov of the Institute of Economics and Industrial&#13;
Engineering, Academy of Sciences, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk; Mr. A. Kalashnikov, co-Director,&#13;
Project Coordination Unit, Moscow; Sobolev Consulting Agency, Moscow; and Messrs. V. Ovchinnikov&#13;
(director) and A. Kolesnikov, North Caucasus Scientific Research Institute of Economic and Social&#13;
Problems, Rostov State University, Rostov.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
62                                                                                ANNEX 1.1&#13;
nonferrous metals industry has been the only one that was not seriously affected, with a minor decrease&#13;
in production in 1991, followed by steady growth of 2.5% in 1992 and 5.2% in 1993.&#13;
6.    In recent years Novosibirsk has lost its relative status as a highly developed industrial region,&#13;
especially since prices were liberalized in 1991. In 1992 the oblast's contribution to Russia's total&#13;
industrial production fell to 0.97%, compared to 1.54% in 1991. Later, when fuel prices stabilized, the&#13;
oblast recovered lost ground in monetary terms, but output nevertheless decreased. In 1994 and 1995&#13;
the rate of industrial recession was higher than in Russia as a whole, and much higher than in other parts&#13;
of western Siberia.&#13;
7.     The oblast's share of all-Russia capital investment also decreased during the years of reform, and&#13;
it now receives 1.2% of investment, compared with 1.6% in 1991. Many of the military industrial&#13;
enterprises, which were financed by the government of Russia's budget, have experienced cuts in&#13;
budgetary transfers and purchase orders. This became especially important in the second half of 1994,&#13;
when the financing of salary adjustments for the enterprises' employees from the federal budget was&#13;
discontinued.&#13;
8.     The oblast is dependent on fuel and energy supplies from other parts of Russia: Krasnoyarsk and&#13;
Kuzbass for coal, Tomsk and Tyumen for natural gas, and Omsk for gasoline. In turn, Novosibirsk&#13;
provides considerable quantities of agricultural produce for domestic markets and exports machinery,&#13;
equipment, and raw materials to international markets.&#13;
9.     As concerns the distribution of labor, in 1994 state-owned enterprises accounted for 68% of&#13;
industrial production, enterprises with combined state private ownership structures and without foreign&#13;
participation accounted for 23%, and the private sector accounted for 9%.&#13;
10.   In contrast with industry, the banking and finance sector, whose activities are concentrated in the&#13;
city of Novosibirsk, has experienced a boom. However, the overabundance of financial operators, the&#13;
weakness of the real sector of the economy, and the city's decreased export potential have led to a flight&#13;
of financial resources.&#13;
11.    Reforms in agriculture have not yet had a positive impact. The oblast's administration managed&#13;
to obtain centralized credit from the federal budget, and in spring, for the first time, paid for grain and&#13;
vegetables purchases in advance. However, the situation remains tense as the structural reforms in&#13;
agriculture have failed to stabilize production.&#13;
Employment Trends&#13;
12.    About 10%  of the labor force is unemployed because of the negative industrial growth.&#13;
According to information from the oblast's employment center, by January 1955 30,377 people were&#13;
looking for jobs, of which 23,249 were registered as unemployed. About 13.3% of those registered as&#13;
unemployed were university graduates, 30.7% were people between the ages of 16 to 29, and 8.9% were&#13;
approaching retirement. Hidden unemployment, estimated at 266,000 people by the end of 1994, is&#13;
growing. For instance, the number of part-time workers and furloughed employees tripled in 1994&#13;
compared with 1993, and exceeded the number of people officially registered as unemployed. The high-&#13;
tech industries, which use highly skilled labor, have laid off the most people. During 1992-93 the largest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1.1                                                                                 63&#13;
reductions in industrial personnel occurred in light industry (42.5%), machine building (24.1 %), and the&#13;
timber processing and paper industry (22.5%). In some areas, however, employment has increased. The&#13;
largest increases have taken place in microbiological enterprises (42%), electric power plants (25%), the&#13;
fuel industry (17%). Banking employment has also grown rapidly.&#13;
Poverty&#13;
13.   The adverse impact of the decline of the military industrial complex can be seen in people's living&#13;
standards. About 30 to 40% of people in the oblast live below the poverty line, as average wages are&#13;
dangerously close to the minimum needed to survive. A random family survey at the end of 1994&#13;
revealed that the average income of about 41 % of the population was below the subsistence minimum&#13;
standard of living.2' About 20% more people in the oblast live below the poverty line than in the rest&#13;
of Russia. Among the 78 republics, oblasts and regions of the Russian Federation, in December 1994&#13;
Novosibirsk Oblast was 76th in terms of per capita income. Average per capita income was as low as&#13;
Rb 156,000 per month and the ratio of income to the survival minimum was 1.2, compared with Rb&#13;
876,000 and 4.6, respectively, in Moscow. For most of people, the main source of cash income is their&#13;
salary (63.7% of all income).&#13;
14.   By January 1995, social protection institutions had registered 521,000 people who needed urgent&#13;
help, including low-income families with children, handicapped people, old people living alone, and&#13;
children.&#13;
Social Sectors&#13;
15.   Of all the oblasts in western Siberia, Novosibirsk has the greatest range of educational&#13;
achievement. While the share of people with higher education is larger than the Russian average, the&#13;
oblast has the second largest proportion of people with less than a secondary education in western Siberia.&#13;
Rural areas of Novosibirsk have the largest proportion of people with only a primary education or less.&#13;
The decline in the number of educated people reflects a decline in enrollment. In 1988-93, total&#13;
enrollment in higher education institutions and professional secondary schools decreased by 2.5% to&#13;
28,000 students, yet during the same period, the number of young people in age 16 to 20 increased by&#13;
8,000 (5%).&#13;
16.    Despite the budget deficit, Novosibirsk has the best medical facilities in the region in terms of&#13;
the provision of hospital facilities and outpatient clinics. Ninety-seven percent of the population is&#13;
provided with medical insurance. The oblast has developed new ways to organize medical care, a&#13;
network including in-patient departments, 8 departments to train nurses and general practitioners. Other&#13;
social services are insufficient, especially homes for the elderly and the disabled.&#13;

B. ROSTOV OBLAST&#13;
17.    Rostov Oblast lies in southern Russia on the Don and Severski Donets rivers. With a population&#13;
of 4.4 million in 1994 that is growing at 0.4% annually, the oblast is the sixth largest in Russia. The&#13;
area of the oblast dates back to the 17th century, when Cossacks organized into military settlements to&#13;
protect the southern flank of Russia that lived there. By the middle of the 19th century, the area had a&#13;
military administrative center in the capital city of Novocherkassk, and an industrial and trade center in&#13;
Rostov-on-Don. The latter became a major transport hub with the completion of railroad construction&#13;
and presence of the biggest port in the Sea of Azov. The oblast was also one of the biggest agrarian&#13;
centers of the Russian empire because of the availability of the large areas of fertile black earth and arable&#13;
land. In the 20th century the oblast's development was based on the following: its economic and&#13;
geographic position at the junction of the Central European part of Russia, the North Caucasus and Trans-&#13;
Caucasia; its favorable agro-climatic conditions; the availability of labor; the well-developed transport&#13;
structure; and its natural resources (coal, quartzite, limestone, sand, and other minerals).&#13;
18.    About 68%  of the oblast's population lives in urban areas, concentrated in the Rostovo-&#13;
Shakhtinski industrial district, although migration to rural areas has increased in recent years. Migration&#13;
into the oblast has also risen with 562,000 people arriving in 1994, 30% more than in 1993. More than&#13;
half the migrants (52%) are from Central Asia and the Caucases, and 16% are from Ukraine. Migration&#13;
from north Siberia and the far east of Russia has doubled in the past 10 years. The birth rate (9.5 per&#13;
1,000) and death rate (15 per 1,000) are slightly higher than in the rest of Russia.&#13;
Economic Structure&#13;
19.   The oblast's economy is based on industry and agriculture. The main branches of industry are&#13;
engineering and metalworking (27.8% ), the food industry(18.7%), electrical energy (8.8%), and the fuel&#13;
industry (8.9%). The oblast produces about 90% of the Commonwealth of Independent States' (CISs)&#13;
bio-protection equipment for atomic power stations, 80% of combine harvesters and electric locomotives,&#13;
50% of cultivators, 33% of high capacity boilers, and 25% of oil pipes. In 1993 the largest volume of&#13;
exports was in machines and equipment (about 84%). Rostov is one of Russia's foremost oblasts in meat&#13;
processing, butter and vegetable oil manufacturing, canning, wine making, and cereal production. It is&#13;
also the largest cereal producer, with gross production of wheat, barley, rice, mustard, maize, and&#13;
sunflowers second only to Krasnodar Krai. In recent years, demand for electrical energy has exceeded&#13;
production by 30%, and this deficit is growing because of Russia's declining volume of coal production.&#13;
20.    During 1993, 1,507 enterprises were totally or partially privatized, more than half of them small&#13;
enterprises belonging to the municipal authorities. The private sector accounted for about 56.2% of the&#13;
total volume of industrial products and employed 42.8% of the oblast's manpower.&#13;
Unemployment&#13;
21.    The oblast's unemployment rate is 5% of the economically active population, about 2% less than&#13;
the Russian average. As of June 1, 1995, 25,539 people were registered as unemployed, most aged 30&#13;
to 49. About 30% of the employed work in industry; 17% in agriculture; 11 % in construction; 10% in&#13;
trade and public catering; and the rest in consumer services, education, and health.&#13;

ANNEX 1.1                                                                              65&#13;
Wages&#13;
22.   In March 1995 average annual wages were Rb 213,000. Real incomes fell by 26.5% during 1995&#13;
because of inflation. In 1994 the structure of income was as follows: 53.5% from wages, 23.9% from&#13;
pensions and subsidies, 8.0% from agriculture, 14.3% from participation in private enterprise, and 0.3%&#13;
from stipends. Wages in industry and the private sector are higher than in the social sectors. In&#13;
education, for instance, the average salary in 1994 was only 60% of the average salary in industry.&#13;
Living Standards&#13;
23.   About 64.5% of the oblast's population lives below the poverty line, which in December 1994&#13;
was Rb 148,500. This number has increased by 14% since 1993. More than half of those below the&#13;
poverty line consume less than 2 kg. of meat and 1 kg. each of fruit and sugar per month. Single&#13;
mothers and pensioners are among those swelling the growing ranks of the poor.&#13;
24.   In 1995 70% of housing was private. Roughly half of the apartments have water, sewerage,&#13;
central heating, and bathrooms. The population's health has deteriorated since 1991 because of a lack&#13;
of money, equipment and drugs. The oblast has 37 health institutions and 38 doctors per 10,000 people.&#13;
25.   Of the approximately 2.2 million members of the labor force, 41% have higher and special&#13;
secondary education (mainly engineers), 32% have secondary education, 18% have an incomplete&#13;
secondary education, and about 9% have a primary or no education according to the 1989 census. Since&#13;
1991, because of reforms in the economy and in education, the number of economists, lawyers, doctors,&#13;
and financial specialists has increased and the number of engineers has decreased. In 1994/95 the oblast&#13;
had 1,928 schools, of which 15 were professional-technical schools, 73 were specialized secondary&#13;
schools, and 18 were institutions of higher education. The number of students in state higher education&#13;
establishments has decreased during the last 10 years because of budgetary constraints and economic&#13;
reforms. As a result, 10 to 30% of students in higher education attend private establishments.&#13;

ANNEX 1.2&#13;
THE STRUCTURE AND CAPACITY OF CONSTRUCTION ENTERPRISES&#13;
in NOVOSIBIRSK and ROSTOVL'&#13;
1.     An important objective of the CSIP is to support the emerging private sector construction industry&#13;
capable of handling contracts for the CSIP subprojects. During the course of three missions to the&#13;
participating oblasts, a set of interviews was conducted by an international consultant, and a survey was&#13;
conducted. The survey questionnaire was designed in English, translated and used by Russian consultants&#13;
as basis for detailed interviews with firms in each oblast. The surveys took place in Novosibirsk in&#13;
October-December 1994, and in Rostov in January-March 1995.&#13;
The following issues were examined:&#13;
*      Structure of the enterprise (assets, principals' equity, turnover);&#13;
*      Type of construction capability;&#13;
*      Previously completed projects;&#13;
*      Overview of company accounts (simplified balance sheet);&#13;
*      Organization and management;&#13;
*      Economic data (Equipment, materials in stock, labor resources etc.); and&#13;
=      Current problems facing the enterprise.&#13;
2.     About 80 to 100 enterprises were identified by each oblast administration as being licensed for&#13;
construction work. In Rostov, 54 firms were selected as a sample for interview and initially contacted&#13;
by phone; of these 39 were successfully interviewed. In Novosibirsk, only 27 firms were successfully&#13;
interviewed. The interviews were also useful as a means of disseminating information about Bank&#13;
procurement practices which should be followed in each oblast.&#13;
Results&#13;
3.     Enterprises were grouped in three categories:&#13;
(I) Large enterprises, with:&#13;
* more than 10 professional engineers and directors,&#13;
* a 1994 turnover greater than $1 million,&#13;
* net value of fixed assets greater than $1 million, and&#13;
* more than 500 employees.&#13;
4.    In Novosibirsk, 5 enterprises in this category were interviewed. One of these, with a turnover&#13;
of about $30 million in the first nine months of 1994, was several times more active than any of the&#13;
others. All five had at least 50% state ownership. Most of the contracts continued to be for the public&#13;
sector, with the share of private clients in turnover ranging from 5% to 30%. The average was 13%.&#13;
5.    In Rostov, 9 enterprises in this category were interviewed. The two largest had turnovers of a&#13;
little over $10 million in 1994. Only four out of these 9 had 50% or more of public ownership. The&#13;
proportion of turnover for private clients ranged from 10% to 100%, averaging 56%.&#13;

(2) Medium enterprises, with:&#13;
* 2 to 10 professional engineers and directors,&#13;
* 1994 turnover between $200,000 and $1 million,&#13;
* net value of assets between. $200,000 and $1 million, and&#13;
* between 200 to 500 employees.&#13;
6.     In Novosibirsk, 12 enterprises in this category were interviewed. Four had a majority public&#13;
ownership, in five there was a minority state shareholding, and three were fully private. The proportion&#13;
of turnover for private clients ranged from 2% to 90%, averaging 49%. There is a correlation between&#13;
the type of ownership and their clients; the three fully private firms obtain 90% of their turnover from&#13;
private clients.&#13;
7.    In Rostov, 24 enterprises in this category were interviewed. Ten had a majority and five a&#13;
minority public ownership. Nine were fully private. Forty-four percent was the average proportion of&#13;
turnover for private clients, but it was at least 60% for all nine private firms.&#13;
(3) Small enterprises, with:&#13;
* only I or 2 engineers/directors,&#13;
* 1994 turnover between $40,000 and $200,000,&#13;
* net value of assets between $40,000 and $200,000, and&#13;
* between 20 to 40 staff.&#13;
8.    In Novosibirsk, 10 enterprises in this category were interviewed. Three had a majority public&#13;
ownership, in three there was a minority state shareholding, and four were fully private. The proportion&#13;
of turnover for private clients averaged 53%.  For the fully private firms, it was at least 80%.&#13;
9.    In Rostov, 6 enterprises in this category were interviewed, three of which were wholly privately-&#13;
owned. The firms with substantial state ownership did over 90% of their business with public contracts.&#13;
The three private firms did at least 50% of their work for private clients. The average share of private&#13;
clients was 26%.&#13;
Business Conditions and Constraints&#13;
10.    The following problems were cited in interviews with the construction companies:&#13;
(a)    Ruble inflation, affecting the completion time of projects and the inability to complete&#13;
certain projects at all.&#13;
(b)    Restrictive conditions and procedures for obtaining contracts or the opportunity to bid.&#13;
(c)    Only a few firms answered questions related to unfair competition and/or dumping. They&#13;
indicated that the market is still tightly controlled, and parastatals still enjoy a&#13;
near-monopoly.&#13;
(d)    Banking conditions make short-term  construction loans either very expensive or&#13;
impossible to obtain. Interest rates up to 60% p.a. were quoted.&#13;
(e)    Due to inflation, clients often delay payments for work completed.&#13;
(f)    Delayed payments frequently lead to problems in meeting payroll obligations and other&#13;
bills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

I.    These issues are fairly common across all sectors of the economy. Many enterprises have&#13;
diversified into other sectors. Both large and small enterprises have taken an interest in producing or&#13;
marketing building materials. Medium and small firms have also diversified into commercial activities,&#13;
equipment rental, or producing private homes or "cottages" if this is not already their primary activity.&#13;
The majority of firms that were diversifying their activities indicated that they planned to hire additional&#13;
employees in the near future.&#13;
12.    Larger enterprises were reluctant to admit that they subcontracted any of their work to smaller&#13;
specialized firms. Smaller firms, on the other hand, admitted that much of their work was subcontracted&#13;
to others in specialized fields, such as electrical work.&#13;
13.    Both oblasts indicated that they and the principal municipalities now use competitive bidding&#13;
procedures to select contractors. In reality, however, it appears that the list of contractors invited to bid&#13;
is usually small--sometimes two or three--suggesting that this is more a process of negotiation rather than&#13;
a fully transparent competition on price.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
14.    Although public ownership and contracts remain dominant in the construction  industry,&#13;
privatization and private contracting have been important elements in the construction industry. There&#13;
should be no difficulty in obtaining effective local competition for civil works contracts under this project.&#13;

FISCAL AND BUDGETARY SYSTEMS IN NOVOSIBIRSK AND ROSTOV OBLASTS&#13;
Revenues&#13;
1.     The financial condition of all Russian oblasts (regional) and municipal governments is heavily&#13;
dependent upon the manufacturing enterprises within their jurisdiction. VAT and corporate income tax&#13;
are shared with the Federal Government ( and from 1995 personal income tax although only to a very&#13;
limited extent).  These taxes are predominantly collected from enterprises. In addition, transfers are&#13;
made to oblasts ("regions" in Table 1.3.1) both on a block grant basis, through the so-called Fund for&#13;
Financial Support of the Subjects of the Federation which aims to equalize partially the fiscal position&#13;
of different oblasts and through a variety of other mechanisms, that are sometimes netted out against each&#13;
other through the so-called "mutual settlements" channel. As can be seen in Table 1.3.1, the structure&#13;
of tax revenue in Novosibirsk and Rostov is fairly similar to the average for Russian oblasts, but in both&#13;
oblasts, especially Novosibirsk, VAT provides a larger share of total revenue, and corporate profits tax&#13;
a smaller share.&#13;

2.     Faced with declining sales and reduced orders, especially serious in the defence industry which&#13;
is important in both oblasts, many enterprises have made losses and/or have been unable to pay their tax&#13;
obligations.  Moreover, a high proportion of employees are on involuntary leave (furlough) at&#13;
approximately one-fifth the regular wage, and such wages are not taxable which further reduces local&#13;
revenues.&#13;
3.     In Rostov revenues in constant rubles fell 37%  from  1991 to 1992, and were still 21 % lower&#13;
in 19941' (Appendix Table 2R). Revenues from federally-set taxes and federal subsidies were 32% and&#13;
57%  lower respectively.  An increase of 151% in revenues from locally-set taxes, reflected a shift in&#13;
policy, but these taxes still remain an insignificant proportion of the revenue base. Consequently, the&#13;
oblast still has very little control over its own revenues, which means that its creditworthiness cannot be&#13;
established independently of national fiscal policies.&#13;
4.     The trends were similar in Novosibirsk (Appendix Table 2N). Revenues in constant rubles fell&#13;
by almost 70% from 1991 to 1992, and were still 41 % lower in 1994. Federally-set tax revenues and&#13;
federal subsidies fell over the period by 33% and 57%, respectively. An increase of 157% was recorded&#13;
in revenues from locally-established taxes, but these still provide an insignificant proportion of total oblast&#13;
revenues.&#13;
5.     The great importance of the manufacturing sector as a source of tax revenue means that the Oblast&#13;
Administrations are dependent upon their principal cities for tax revenue. Both Rostov-on-Don and&#13;
Novosibirsk municipalities negotiate the proportion of their tax revenues that will be passed up to the&#13;
oblast budget. Primarily agricultural raions receive little tax. Other jurisdictions cannot meet 20 to 60%&#13;
of their expenditures even by retaining the entire oblast share of the federally-set taxes, plus their locally&#13;
established taxes.&#13;
6.      Oblast officials expected a recovery of Federal Government orders for local industry in the&#13;
autumn of 1994. When this did not happen, the oblasts were forced to borrow money in order to&#13;
continue operating. The municipality of Novosibirsk formed a bank and began issuing "veksals". A total&#13;
of Rb 1.8 billion (US$360,000) has been issued as a test.2' The oblast has been authorized to issue an&#13;
issue of Rb 50 billion ($10 million). In Rostov, city officials are borrowing from banks and recording&#13;
these receipts as revenues. The banks are issuing commercial paper (certificates of deposit) to attract&#13;
long-term deposits. The paper is being issued as a term-deposit at 140% per annum, with a maturity of&#13;
March 1, 1997. The City of Rostov is an equity holder in the commercial bank, "Doninvest" Bank.&#13;
7.     Appendix Tables IR and IN contain the financial statements as of December 31, 1994 for the&#13;
two oblasts. Both oblasts show balanced operations, in order to remain in compliance with the budgetary&#13;
law as mandated by the Russian federation. However, both oblasts had large amounts of payables that&#13;
were not reported officially. In Novosibirsk, the payables in the beginning of 1995 were reported at Rb&#13;
200 billion (US$50 million). Oblasts and principal cities within the oblasts admitted to being in arrears&#13;
with utility enterprises. The huge debts owed to the utilities are being passed on to the federal level.&#13;
' The accuracy of the large reported gaps between revenues and expenditures in 1991 and 1994 is being verified.&#13;
2' These are promissory notes, issued in connection with a specific program and payable in three months, that can be used&#13;
to settle all payments, including taxation, related to that program.&#13;

ANNEX 1.3                                                                                   71&#13;
Expenditures&#13;
8.     Appendix Tables 1R and IN summarize 1994 expenditures for each oblast, consolidated for the&#13;
whole of the oblast, and show how the total has changed in real terms over the last few years. The&#13;
structure of expenditure does not differ greatly in the two oblasts. In Rostov, expenditures classified as&#13;
for the "people's economy" consisting of agriculture, transport, housing and utilities, comprised 43 % of&#13;
the total expenditures. Housing and utilities were about half of this amount. In Novosibirsk, the&#13;
comparable figure was 39%; compared with Rostov a much smaller proportion went to housing and&#13;
utilities, and a much higher proportion went for assistance to agriculture.  Rostov made loans to&#13;
enterprises consisting 4.1 % of its budget. These were not recorded separately for Novosibirsk, but may&#13;
be included in the 9.3%, classified as "other expenditures."  In the summary budgets, capital and&#13;
recurrent expenditures are not disaggregated. As with revenues, total oblast expenditures fell in 1992&#13;
to 30% of its 1991 figure and had recovered to only about 60% in 1994. Contrary to expectations,&#13;
capital expenditures appear to have fluctuated less than recurrent expenditures, and actually is higher in&#13;
1994 in real terms than in 1991. (This may well reflect the inadequacy of the consumer price index as&#13;
a deflator, but the rise in real investment in Rostov appears to be especially remarkable. Although&#13;
unconfirmed, it is possible that these increases are directly related to increases in federal housing funds&#13;
allotted to construct housing for the decommissioned military personnel.)&#13;
9.    For this project, there is particular interest in social expenditures (Appendix Tables 3R and 3N).&#13;
In Rostov, health expenditures in 1992 were only 44% of their 1991 level in real terms, and education&#13;
expenditures were 43 %. The deflators are those of the consumer price index, and probably overstate&#13;
the rate of inflation for a labor-intensive social sector. There was then a marked recovery, and in 1994&#13;
budgetary health expenditures were 56% of their 1991 level and education expenditures were 78%.&#13;
Since the health data do not include expenditures by the Territorial Health Insurance Funds (THIF), the&#13;
fall in health expenditure has been less severe than these data indicate.  In both sectors, surprisingly,&#13;
wages fell more sharply than other expenditures. In Novosibirsk, the trends are similar but more&#13;
pronounced. In 1992 health expenditures fell to 36% of their 1991 level and recovered to 66% in 1994.&#13;
Education expenditures fell to 37% and recovered to 73%. Non-wage recurrent expenditures had&#13;
recovered to about their 1991 level by 1994. In both oblasts, therefore, the share of both sectors has&#13;
been protected, and has even risen slightly, especially if the THIF expenditures are included.&#13;
10.   In 1994, capital expenditure in health in Rostov Oblast was 21 % lower than in 1991; in education&#13;
they were II % lower. This is a substantially smaller drop than recurrent expenditures, which is&#13;
surprising. In Novosibirsk oblast capital expenditures in health were 26% and in education 59% lower&#13;
than in 1994. This is more in line with expectations at a time of severe economic difficulty.&#13;
Debt Capacity&#13;
11.   In both oblasts, with a loan of US$72.5 million each, the repayment amount on an annual basis&#13;
with interest capitalized (as worst case scenario), will amount to the equivalent of less than 2% of the&#13;
1994 budget (see Appendix Tables 4R and 4N). For most raions the situation is quite different. Scales&#13;
of repayment which will vary from 10% to 50% of the amount of the loan will be proposed by the oblast&#13;
authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72                                                                                ANNEX 1.3&#13;
Budget Preparation and Control&#13;
12.   The system of budget preparation, in both oblasts, continues to evolve from budgeting based on&#13;
expenditure norms to budgeting based on availability of revenues. The first step is to forecast revenues&#13;
based on prior-year collections. Expenditure requests from raions are based on prior year spending plus&#13;
an inflation index. The requested budgets are verified, by the oblast, for compliance with the established&#13;
norms. Expenditures are then programmed into the budget, taking into account the availability in&#13;
revenues, thereby implying across-the-board expenditure cuts. The oblast finance departments approve&#13;
the budgets of the raions only to the extent of determining the subsidy level. The raions are free to&#13;
re-program expenditures within reasonable guidelines. The entire budgetary process is in a constant state&#13;
of flux at the sub-national level due to the frequent changes in federal regulations. Year-to-year changes&#13;
in tax sharing arrangements mean that lower level authorities do not know their revenues until upper level&#13;
budgets have been finalized, and this process is often delayed. This does not encourage good budgetary&#13;
practice. While greater local budgetary control has been proposed and legislated, full autonomy over&#13;
local budget operations has not been approached.&#13;
13.   The City of Novosibirsk and City of Rostov-on-Don establish their own capital investment&#13;
priorities but capital spending priorities for rayons and smaller towns, dependent upon subsidies, are&#13;
determined at the oblast level. Capital expenditures are not separated from the recurrent budget, leading&#13;
to a loss of transparency and budgetary control. Novosibirsk and Rostov-on-Don have both a budget&#13;
and an "extra-budget." Extra-budgetary funds are obtained from user fees, and fines and other penalties&#13;
are used to provide working capital loans to municipal enterprises for various manufacturing activities.&#13;
These loans are on a revolving basis. The extra-budget fund is also used to finance some long-term&#13;
capital investments. The City of Novosibirsk utilizes extra-budget funding to finance housing construction&#13;
through the Municipal Bank of Novosibirsk.&#13;
14.    A typical budget format is shown in Table IR. The budget is a two-page summary of all&#13;
activities, and lacks transparency and a hierarchical format. Budget and accounting formats are still&#13;
those used in the Soviet period, although changes are now beginning to be implemented.&#13;
15.    Financial reporting in both oblasts is based on cash expenditures. Presently, encumbrance&#13;
accounting does not exist and although accrual accounting is in practice it is not represented on the&#13;
budget-to-actual reports. The accrued expenditure amounts are recorded and maintained only in the&#13;
sub-ledgers. Understandably, the necessary level of detail in reporting procedures would be difficult to&#13;
obtain under the manual systems of accounting currently in practice at the sub-national level. Senior&#13;
officials have requested urgent and immediate technical assistance in reclassifying the budget and&#13;
structuring a hierarchical reporting format. If effective autonomous municipal management is ever to&#13;
be realized, administrations at all levels of government must have automated accounting systems,&#13;
competent personnel, and sound technical assistance.&#13;

ANNEX 3.1&#13;
SELECTION CRITERIA AND MODEL APPRAISAL FOR EDUCATION SUBPROJECTS&#13;
A. Selection Criteria&#13;
I .    Each education facility subproject satisfies criteria that contribute to the achievement of accepted&#13;
strategic objectives of the education sector as they affect school facilities. In addition, project proposals&#13;
require the satisfaction of criteria that are more specific. While specific criteria appear commonsensical,&#13;
they require close attention in the particular circumstances in which they are applied in this project. For&#13;
example, all school subprojects should satisfy the following criteria:&#13;
a.     The capacities and conditions of the utilities serving the school should be adequate.&#13;
Rationale: The supply of water, heat from central heating plants, sanitary and drainage&#13;
sewers and of electricity is frequently problematic and subject to failures in the areas&#13;
served by this project.  For example, school facilities can be rendered relatively&#13;
ineffective and investments in them unproductive, if the supply of hot water from the&#13;
central heating plant is insufficient, if the supply of water is disrupted or polluted, if the&#13;
sanitary sewers are broken or blocked or if the electricity supply is disrupted. Further,&#13;
a common problem with utilities involving water is that failure, if uncorrected, leads to&#13;
the destruction of the facility itself through the undermining of foundations.&#13;
b.     Environmental considerations have been taken into account and the subproject is in&#13;
compliance with Russian rules and regulations.&#13;
Rationale: Russia has stringent environmental regulations and compliance with them is&#13;
particularly important given the often severe environmental problems that are confronted.&#13;
With school buildings, this means that particular concern needs to be directed to the&#13;
disposition of building materials, sanitation, the quality and control of water, safety, and&#13;
the cleanliness of schools and school grounds.&#13;
c.     The solution (rehabilitation, extension or the construction of a new school) proposed by&#13;
the subproject should be cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness is defined in terms of the&#13;
discounted per student costs of providing adequate teaching space. In practical terms,&#13;
it becomes important to estimate the remaining life of the facility, before and after the&#13;
project and operating cost, before and after the project. The cost of the project should&#13;
also include the value of structures that would be destroyed to make room for new&#13;
construction.&#13;
Rationale: Because of costs and measurement problems, it would not make sense to&#13;
undertake a full-blown cost benefit analysis of subprojects. Rather, cost-effectiveness&#13;
analysis should be performed that estimates the discounted per student costs of providing&#13;
a school place. The stream of costs to be taken into account include operating costs as&#13;
well as capital construction costs.&#13;
d.     The school facility which is of unusually high quality in terms of design and construction&#13;
and therefore high value should be given preference over schools of lower quality. This&#13;
is an extension of criterion (c) above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
83                                                                                   ANNEX 3.1&#13;
Rationale: There are a number of older schools that fall into this category. Here the&#13;
concern is the preservation of the more valuable facilities assets that may be threatened&#13;
by failures in systems such as roofs, water, heating and sanitation systems, that have&#13;
outlived their useful lives.&#13;
e.     It should be shown that there will be a demand for the services of the facility during the&#13;
remainder of its useful life (after the project). In effect this means that projections need&#13;
to be made of the school age population during this period and account is taken of the&#13;
designation of school catchment areas.&#13;
Rationale: This matter is of particular importance in the context of this project where&#13;
fertility rates have declined to unusually low levels and where there has been large&#13;
changes in the distribution of the population due to migration.&#13;
f.     For school extensions: the existing structure should be restorable to a quality consistent&#13;
with the new construction, and plans for the extended school include a reconsideration&#13;
of the allocation of all school space consistent with effectively teaching the curriculum.&#13;
Rationale: It does not make much practical sense if the standard of finish of an extension&#13;
is substantially superior to what already exists.  Further, by considering education&#13;
specifications of the curriculum, it is likely that a pedagogically more effective school&#13;
will result if existing space is reallocated concurrent with building the addition.&#13;
A Note on New Schools&#13;
2.     Although the thrust of the project would be on rehabilitating existing facilities, it would also&#13;
include three new schools. Decisions to invest in new schools in Novosibirsk and Rostov oblasts were&#13;
based upon analyses of the demand and supply of school places. The demand for school places has&#13;
several components: the demand for additional places; a replacement demand; and demand associated&#13;
with school consolidations or geographic redistribution of the population. Analysis of the supply of&#13;
school places includes considerations not only of numbers, but of the quality and distribution of the&#13;
spaces. These analyses show that in spite of an decline in fertility, there is a very substantial pent up&#13;
demand for replacement schools because of inadequate investments in the past and for new schools in&#13;
some new catchment areas because of the redistribution of population into suburbs.&#13;
3.      During project preparation, demographic surveys of the two oblasts with particular attention&#13;
given to the areas for which new schools were proposed. These survey results are available in project&#13;
files. The findings for the two oblasts were similar. Both have experienced substantial declines in&#13;
fertility during the last five years in particular. On the other hand, both are experiencing very sizable&#13;
increases in immigration from other parts of the former Soviet Union. Immigration does not entirely&#13;
offset the decline with the consequence that the total school age population will decline somewhat (by&#13;
5-8%) until 2005, when it is expected to increase again. There is, however, a substantial redistribution&#13;
of population underway in both oblasts, largely but not entirely associated with immigration. In Rostov&#13;
oblast, immigration is largely responsible for the growth of suburbs around the main towns which are not&#13;
well served by schools and other social services. In Novosibirsk oblast, immigration, in the short term&#13;
at least, is largely associated with a growing rural population with substantial stability in the population&#13;
of Novosibirsk municipality itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.1                                                                                   84&#13;
4.      The supply of school places is inadequate both in terms of numbers of places and in their quality.&#13;
In the first place, almost no new schools have been built during the last two decades and the schedule of&#13;
school rehabilitations is grossly inadequate. Except in some rural catchment areas, all schools are double-&#13;
shifted and many are triple-shifted. In Rostov oblast, suburbs are not served and students must travel&#13;
substantial distances to schools. There is a need to build new spaces in the suburbs and to redefine&#13;
catchment areas. (A report on the catchment areas for the proposed new schools is in Project Files.)&#13;
Second, very few new schools have been built during the last two decades to replace schools that have&#13;
little useful life remaining. Those that have been built since the mid-1960's are of very poor quality.&#13;
Almost all school have inadequate mechanical systems, are not insulated and are energy inefficient. The&#13;
design of space is poor and the schools' physical appearance is dismal, in spite of the considerable efforts&#13;
of teachers, parents and students. Designs are pedagogically antiquated. Because of their designs, they&#13;
are difficult to keep clean and to maintain. While virtually all schools require major rehabilitation, many&#13;
schools are not worth it because of major structural faults such as broken foundations and load-bearing&#13;
walls and generally poor initial construction and design. The new construction proposed for Novosibirsk&#13;
are for replacement facilities to accommodate students in facilities that would still be somewhat&#13;
overcrowded. The new construction in Rostov is proposed for suburbs where schools for adjacent&#13;
catchment areas are not only overcrowded, but are not worth rehabilitating.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
85                                                                                 ANNEX 3.1&#13;
3.     Description of School's Physical Condition (As reported by users: School Director, Teachers,&#13;
Parents Association).&#13;
I.     Exterior. The school was shoddily constructed in four months in 1963 as part of a large national&#13;
construction program that introduced the use of prefabricated concrete panels as a basic design&#13;
feature. The most notable features of the exterior of the building are rotten window frames and&#13;
broken windows, disintegrating masonry around windows and near the roof, missing or broken&#13;
gutters and down spouts, exposed cracks in concrete roof panels, broken steps at entrances.&#13;
There is a lack of provision for drainage of water away from the building.&#13;
(a)    Foundation and load bearing walls. The foundation on the south-west side of the&#13;
building has been gradually undermined by water from the heating, water and sanitation&#13;
systems. Currently, the loadbearing wall on that side of the building is not sufficiently&#13;
stable and requires reinforcement. Substantial work has already been done to reinforce&#13;
load bearing walls in the main stairwell. But recurring leakages in the main water system&#13;
continue to threaten the structure.&#13;
(b)    Roof and Drainage. The roof of the building leaks, has no further useful life and should&#13;
be replaced. At the same time, gaps between the concrete panels that comprise the roof s&#13;
structure should be filled. The gaps are particularly obvious and unsightly at the roof&#13;
overhangs. All gutters and down spouts are either rusted out, broken or have fallen away&#13;
from the building and have been removed. This causes water to flow down the side of&#13;
the building. This problem contributes to undermining the foundation that was noted&#13;
above. Water does not drain from the site.&#13;
(c)    Facade (integrity with respect to protection from  weather and appearance).  The&#13;
appearance of the facade was noted above in the discussion of the exterior. The facade,&#13;
lacking any grouting or caulking does not provide adequate protection from weather.&#13;
The condition of the windows leads to substantial heat loss.&#13;
(d)    Grounds. The grounds have been used several times as a dump site. There is no control&#13;
over vehicular and pedestrian traffic at the site. It is inadequately drained.&#13;
II.    Interior.&#13;
(a)    Heating. The system does not heat the building adequately. It has failed totally on three&#13;
occasions during the last five years because of broken lines or major leaks. The system&#13;
has been a major contributor to structural damage to floors, walls and foundations. The&#13;
exposed radiators and pipes in halls and rooms are a threat to children when they get too&#13;
hot.&#13;
(b)    Electrical. The electrical system was substantially renovated in 1992. But most rooms&#13;
are still too dark for reading. Provision has never been made for exterior lighting, which&#13;
is needed for security reasons. Being double-shifted, the school is open during evenings&#13;
and lighting is needed during this period. The school is also a community meeting place&#13;
during evenings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.1                                                                                 86&#13;
(c)    Water. Of all systems, the water system is in greatest need of repair. There have been&#13;
frequent and damaging leaks. Concrete floors have had to be torn up to effect repairs.&#13;
Leaks have damaged the foundation. The water itself is usually of minimally acceptable&#13;
standard, but on occasion becomes unsafe for drinking. There are an inadequate number&#13;
of water fountains. Similarly, there are an inadequate number of washbasins in latrines&#13;
and there is no sink available for custodial purposes.&#13;
(d)    Sanitation. There are two latrines and eight toilets currently in operation in the building.&#13;
One latrine was closed and converted into an inadequate cloak room. The sanitary pipes&#13;
have been subject to cracks and breaks, largely because of floor and foundation problems.&#13;
(e)    Floors. Wooden hallway floors and some classroom floors have rotted.  While fresh&#13;
coats of paint have been applied they are unsightly.&#13;
(f)    Walls.  Interior walls are cracked and dirty.  The tiled walls at the entrance are&#13;
unsightly.&#13;
(g)    Windows, caulking, insulation, etc. Next to the water system, the building's most&#13;
important problems relate to windows, caulking and insulation. The wooden casements&#13;
and frames for windows have, in most cases, rotted to a point where they cannot be&#13;
caulked. Some windows are broken. Masonry work is needed around many windows.&#13;
Since systematic preventive maintenance is never performed, it is likely that the windows&#13;
have not been painted or caulked since their original installation. There is no insulation&#13;
in the building.&#13;
(h)    Other (commentary on school closings and other constraints on teaching the curriculum).&#13;
During the last five years, the school has been closed on three occasions due to failures&#13;
in water and heating pipes. The heating system cannot heat the school to an adequate&#13;
level of comfort during cold weather.&#13;
In addition to the problems noted above, there is inadequate cloakroom space, inadequate&#13;
space for storage of materials of all kinds and no space or provision for custodial work&#13;
(equipment, supplies, a sink, etc.). Furniture in some classes is unsuitable for the age&#13;
of the students. The doors throughout the building are unsightly and inadequate. The&#13;
teaching staff do not have an adequate space for a staff room; it badly needs renovation.&#13;
4.     Governance.&#13;
(a)    Headmaster; Assistant Headmaster    -     Abrosimova Galina Ivanovna&#13;
(b)    Head of Parents Association        -      Natasha Pentovsky&#13;
(c)    Head of Teachers Association       -      (Not identified)&#13;
(d)    Process for vetting of subproject with governing bodies above. The director of the&#13;
school and the head of the teachers association were interviewed on site on two separate&#13;
occasions during the March 1995 preparation mission by Bank staff, with a representative&#13;
of the engineering firm, Elektron, and of the raion's chief building inspector. These&#13;
meetings followed the survey during December 1994 by Elektron. The upgrades proposed&#13;
here which augment the survey report are direct results of the interviews.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
87                                                                                 ANNEX 3.1&#13;
5.     Statements by School Director, Parents Association and the Teachers Association on the&#13;
impact of the school's condition on their work and the performance of their separate roles.&#13;
Teachers and the School Director should include comments on the quality of education.&#13;
(Example of school Director's statement is in Attachment A.) These statements should be part&#13;
of the school's and raion's application for financial assistance for school rehabilitation or school&#13;
extension.&#13;
Note: In future appraisals, Items I to 5 above, will be completed by school and raion officials&#13;
prior to the conduct of an official survey. The terms of reference of the surveying firm will&#13;
include official interviews and consultations with the director of the school, the heads of the&#13;
teachers and parents associations.&#13;
6.     Scope of Work. (The completed survey documents should be considered part of the appraisal.&#13;
They are summarized below.)&#13;
(a)    Surveyor                            -      Elektron (Engineering&#13;

(b)    Summary of scope of work and estimated costs.&#13;
Roof and drainage. The roof, gutters and down-spouts are to be replaced. The&#13;
slab-construction of the roof has cracks that will be plastered filling. A culvert&#13;
is to be built to drain water from the site.&#13;
ii.    Facade. All exterior walls require pointing up. Masonry work is required near&#13;
windows and near the top of exterior walls. The exterior steps at the entrance are&#13;
to be repaired.&#13;
iii.    Grounds. A fence is to be installed around the entire perimeter to prevent&#13;
vehicular and pedestrian trespassing and dumping on the site. The grounds will&#13;
be cleaned up.&#13;
iv.    Heating. The entire heating system requires replacement, including the filtration&#13;
system outside at the edge of the site. A double system is to be installed with&#13;
adequate cut-offs.&#13;
v.     Electrical. The entire electrical system is to be replaced and upgraded providing&#13;
for a larger number of circuit breakers and more intense lighting in the&#13;
classrooms. An exterior lighting system is to be installed as an upgrade.&#13;
vi.    Water. Both water and sanitation systems are to be entirely replaced.  A total&#13;
of four new water fountains are to be installed as an upgrade. The cement floor&#13;
at the entrance which covers the water pipes is to be breached and access&#13;
provided for routine maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 3.1                                                                                   88&#13;
vii.   Sanitation. The entire sanitation system is to be replaced and 16 new toilets&#13;
installed. Four of these will be a result of restoring the cloakroom to its use as&#13;
a latrine.&#13;
viii. Floors. Wooden floors on the 2nd and 3rd floors are to be replaced in hallways.&#13;
Floors in classrooms to be covered with sheet linoleum (imported to be of&#13;
adequate quality).&#13;
ix.    Interior walls. Cracks are to be filled and all interior walls are to be painted a&#13;
double coat.&#13;
x.     Windows, caulking, insulation. All windows are to be replaced. The entire&#13;
structure is to be caulked where needed.&#13;
xi.    Other. The foundation and exterior walls on the south side of the building are&#13;
to be reinforced. A steel band is to be installed around the entire structure at the&#13;
foundation level.&#13;
(c)    Notes on Upgrades (as opposed to repairs and replacements).&#13;
The new external culvert and fence (noted above).&#13;
The new water fountains and toilets (noted above).&#13;
The linoleum floors in classrooms (noted above).&#13;
The exterior lighting system (noted above).&#13;
All doors in the building are to be replaced. A new cloakroom is to be built. Storage&#13;
space is to be provided for equipment and materials, including maintenance and custodial&#13;
materials. The space will include a sink. Some classroom furniture is to be replaced&#13;
where grade school furniture is being used for secondary school students. The staff room&#13;
is to be renovated. The tiles in the entrance are to be replaced and the floor repaired.&#13;
7.     Envirommental Analysis.&#13;
(a)    Baseline Situation.  The school grounds have been used as a dump site and is&#13;
inadequately drained. There are safety problems within the school as one fire evacuation&#13;
door has been blocked, and fire extinguishers need servicing. Also, heating radiators&#13;
pose a hazard for children. The school lacks insulation, windows are broken and the&#13;
building is in need of caulking --it is very energy inefficient. Sanitary facilities are&#13;
inadequate and the water supply to the school sometimes poses a health hazard.&#13;
(i)    Heating system (central or individual; energy used, security aspects).  The&#13;
heating system is attached to a central heating plant for the raion that burns oil.&#13;
It is unknown how much energy is used by the school. It is known that the&#13;
current system is inefficient because of a lack of means for regulating&#13;
temperatures and because it is a single-pipe system. The situation is exacerbated&#13;
by a lack of insulation, caulking and inadequate windows on the building. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
89                                                                               ANNEX 3.1&#13;
main pipe entering the building is insufficiently insulated. Pipes and radiators&#13;
require covers to make them safe.&#13;
(ii)    Watersupply (canalization of pipes; water quality). The water pipes have had&#13;
major leaks that have undermined the foundation in one part. Nothing can be&#13;
done within the project to improve the quality of the city's water.&#13;
(iii)   Wastewater (canalization of pipes; discharges, etc.). Wastewater currently leaks&#13;
from broken and cracked pipes which are to be repaired under the project.&#13;
(iv)   Landscaping at end of rehabilitation work. The school site has been used as a&#13;
dump site. A fence is to be installed around the perimeter to prevent future&#13;
dumping and all refuse is to be removed. The grounds are to be landscaped with&#13;
trees and shrubs.&#13;
(v)    FYre security arrangements. One of the school's fire exits has been barred. This&#13;
is to be opened providing three fire exits at the bottom of three stairwells. The&#13;
site did not have workable fire extinguishers and this situation is to be rectified.&#13;
(b)    Regulatory  and  Institutional Considerations.    Record  of compliance  with&#13;
environmental and safety regulations.&#13;
(c)    Environmental impact of proposal. Proposed rehabilitation works will have positive&#13;
effects on the surrounding environment since many of the existing leaking pipes would&#13;
be replaced, and the school building would be more insulated, resulting in lowering total&#13;
heating required for its operation.&#13;
(d)    Mitigation and/or enhancement measures.&#13;
(i)    Disposal of Building and Insulation materials. The material is to be carried to&#13;
an officially approved dump site.&#13;
(ii)    How is waste material to be disposed of. Waste material is to be taken from the&#13;
site to an officially approved dump.&#13;
(iii)   How is solid waste from school disposed of? Solid waste from the school is&#13;
burned in an incinerator. Landscaping at completion of work.&#13;

TOTAL (Base cost)             $    700,000&#13;
9.     Estimate Remaining Life of School after the upgrades. In most circumstances, this school&#13;
would be retired from service and demolished because of its low standard of initial construction&#13;
and because there is little that can be done to make it energy and pedagogically efficient. It lacks&#13;
space for supplies, custodial services and staff. However inefficient in these respects, it can be&#13;
maintained in service for another 10 years for a total of about $1,200 per student place. By&#13;
comparison, a newly constructed school, with a life of about 25-30 years would cost a total of&#13;
over $12,000 per place which the government cannot currently afford.&#13;
10.   Implementation Schedule and Responsibilities (see Attachment B).&#13;
11.    Basis for Establishing the Priority for this Project.&#13;
(a)    Strategic or policy basis. Kirov micro raion has a population of 12,000 and a school&#13;
age population, ages 7 through 18, of approximately 1,900, 800 of whom attend school&#13;
170. Because of overcrowding, the remainder attend schools in adjacent raions or&#13;
vocational schools during grades 10 and 11. Currently, there is only a small increase in&#13;
population due to immigration but this almost exactly offsets the decline attributable to&#13;
historically low levels of fertility. The school age population of the micro raion is&#13;
projected to remain relatively static during the next few years and then begin to grow&#13;
rather gradually as fertility rates partially recover to earlier levels. Increases in school age&#13;
population are not expected until 2003-2005. Kirov School 170 should be replaced with&#13;
a new and larger school at the end of this period.&#13;
(b)    Economic evaluation. In its present condition, the school has little or no useful life. The&#13;
alternative to rehabilitating or replacing this school is to transport students to two schools&#13;
at 8 and 12 kilometers away. Both of these schools are already overcrowded operating&#13;
in two shifts.&#13;
Ideally, a new school should be built on the site that has a better allocation of&#13;
space among uses and separates primary from secondary students. A new structure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
91                                                                                   ANNEX 3.1&#13;
would result in substantial saving in energy, recurrent repair and upkeep costs and be&#13;
much more efficient pedagogically. It would provide for an enriched curriculum and the&#13;
eventual acquisition and efficient installation of computers and the use of television for&#13;
distance education. It would be safer and more comfortable. The capital costs of such&#13;
a structure would be about $7 million or about $12,000 per student place and have a life&#13;
of about 30 years.&#13;
The capital costs of the rehabilitation of school 170 in Kirov micro raion, would&#13;
be about one-tenth of that at $1200 per student place and extend the life of the structure&#13;
by about 10 years. The rehabilitated school and a new school are, of course, not directly&#13;
comparable in terms of the services that they would yield. The rehabilitated school would&#13;
have higher recurrent costs for repairs and maintenance and would remain energy&#13;
inefficient because of the lack of adequate insulation. However, a comparison of the&#13;
discounted costs of operating a new school and a rehabilitated school 170 yields an&#13;
overwhelming advantage to the rehabilitated school because of the high initial costs of&#13;
a new building. A discount rate of 15% substantially diminishes the importance of&#13;
differences in recurrent costs of operation between a new school and a rehabilitated&#13;
school. Given the enormous difference in the capital costs of these alternatives, a direct&#13;
comparison of the discounted operating costs seems unnecessary. The attached table (see&#13;
Attachment C) compares only the discounted capital and recurrent costs of the project (a&#13;
rehabilitated school) with the "without-project" alternative.  The "without-project"&#13;
alternative assumes that the school would close and that new transportation costs would&#13;
be incurred.&#13;
School 170 ranks in the upper decile of all schools that are eligible for&#13;
rehabilitation in terms of cost effectiveness ratio. Most schools in the upper decile are&#13;
those that have little or no remaining life and meet technical criteria in terms of&#13;
soundness of the basic structure. Other schools in the upper decile include structurally&#13;
sound schools whose lives are threatened by failures in heating, water and sanitation&#13;
systems. The cost-effectiveness ratio is equal to the discounted costs of the rehabilitated&#13;
school divided by the number of students at risk. The former reflects the life of the&#13;
school and a 15% discount rate. The latter is total enrollments rather than total student&#13;
places.&#13;
(c)    Social considerations. School 170 is an integral part of the Kirov sub-raion community.&#13;
Most residents, parents and many teachers are former students. The community&#13;
contributes substantially to the school in terms of in-kind services. They attempt to&#13;
remove debris that is dumped on the site by outsiders, they help teachers to maintain and&#13;
decorate classrooms and are involved as much as possible in painting and winterizing.&#13;
The teachers themselves, helped by parents, do virtually all of the custodial work.&#13;
The school provides space for community meetings and community social events&#13;
within the limits of the spaces that are there. It is the social center of the community.&#13;
(d)    Other considerations.  This analysis should include a description regarding the&#13;
importance of the school to local enterprises and its relationship to enterprises, and&#13;
community and extra curricular training activities that may occur in the school.&#13;

ATTACHMENT A&#13;
STATEMENT BY SCHOOL DIRECTOR&#13;
ON THE IMPACT OF THE SCHOOL'S CONDITION ON HER WORK&#13;
I was a student in this school, then later a teacher and, for the last five years, its director. The school's physical&#13;
condition is a source of considerable pain and embarrassment to me. It is unsightly and it is a difficult place to&#13;
teach in. It is difficult to maintain and to keep clean. I and my teachers are embarrassed when parents visit this&#13;
school. We spend a considerable amount of time cleaning and maintaining the place so that it is suitable for&#13;
students. The situation is aggravated because the school is overcrowded and operating in two shifts. The physical&#13;
condition of school 170 is nothing less than desperate.&#13;
Walking around the outside of the building, you will notice that the grounds have been used as a dump site. It is&#13;
not adequately drained particularly with respect to water coming from the roof. Looking at the exterior, one can&#13;
see that the building is clearly in need of major rehabilitation. Gutters and down spouts have rotted away and water&#13;
runs down the side of the building. In the winter, it freezes. The roof leaks. The mortar work around the top of&#13;
the building is disintegrating. There are gaps between the concrete slabs that make up the roof. Most of the&#13;
window frames are rotten and some windows are broken. Windows provide inadequate protection from cold Siberian&#13;
weather. The concrete steps into the building entrances have disintegrated and are a hazard. Also, you can see the&#13;
makeshift structure that I have had to put up to store school supplies, including such items as paint. We have no&#13;
storage space in the school except the cupboards that are installed in some classrooms.&#13;
Inside the building, you will note that there is no space for the building's custodial care supplies and equipment and&#13;
no sink for this purpose. There is inadequate provision for a cloakroom. The current cloakroom was made&#13;
converting a latrine that we also need desperately. We do have a staff room, but you will notice that it is in poor&#13;
condition and in need of renovation. We have only four drinking fountains in the building and a total of 12 toilets.&#13;
All of the doors in the building are make-shift and very unsightly. I would like to have them replaced. The&#13;
entrance to the building has tiles on the walls that are not particularly pleasant to see. The entrance hall floor has&#13;
been torn up several times to repair water pipes. The floor was restored by simply cementing over the hole made&#13;
in the floor. Leaks in our water pipes are a recurring problem that we never seem to solve permanently. The&#13;
system should be replaced.&#13;
Because we are double-shifted, we use the building after dark. The community also uses it for meeting and social&#13;
events after dark. Yet, there is no outside lighting for the building and this creates a hazardous condition for people&#13;
who use the building. The school is often uncomfortably cold in the winter, because of the condition of the&#13;
windows, lack of caulking and sometimes inadequate heat from the pipes and radiators. On the other hand,&#13;
sometimes the heat is so hot in the pipes and radiators that they are dangerous to the students. They do not have&#13;
protective covers.&#13;
The school covers grades 1-11 and this means that we need different furniture and facilities for primary and&#13;
secondary students. Currently, we have more primary school furniture than we need and insufficient furniture for&#13;
older students. Older students are crammed into seats and desks that make them most uncomfortable.&#13;
In closing, I want to say that I find this kind of international cooperation and assistance to help our school to be&#13;
most heartening and encouraging for the future.&#13;

Notes:&#13;
I. All choobs in the project are in desperate need of either rehabilitation or replacement. It is ssumed here that the 'without proje* scenario will involve closing the school after three yean and the rasuig _mea of&#13;
students and teachmer to adjacent school districts that are already overcrowded. They will be double- nd often triple-shifted in thee schools.&#13;
2. In the 'without project scenario, it is sumuted that: (a) Teacher and teaching materials costs will not change after the third year and reasignment to other schools. (b) Maintenace costs in the school to which&#13;
reasignmen  are made will increase marginally. Note that these costs re already extemeiy low reflecing the existing situation. (c) After the third year trunsportsion costs will be incurred. Trmnqoctation cost am&#13;
financed 50% by sudent with about a 50% subsidy from the sate. The higher economic cos reflect the continuing subsidy on energy. (d) Eletricity cots will not chanp. The schools to which stuet sre reassigned&#13;
will be operating patlilUy at time that will require illumirAtion.&#13;

ANNEX 3.2&#13;
EDUCATION FACILITIES MANAGEMENT&#13;
AND SUPPORTING MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM&#13;
NOVISIBIRSK MUNICIPALITY&#13;
1. THE SITUATION&#13;
A.    Educational Context&#13;
1.    Responsibilities for educational planning and investment have been devolved from central to lower&#13;
levels of government but these have not yet developed the necessary organization and staffing. Indeed&#13;
inadequate resources over an extended period of time has led to an erosion of capacity to manage&#13;
educational facilities. Long-standing responsibilities for routine maintenance, rehabilitation and the&#13;
operation of facilities have suffered from a lack of finance. The need to develop new systems of&#13;
organization and management of school facilities, including the necessary management information&#13;
systems, is made more difficult because currently, information about schools is scattered and incomplete,&#13;
often existing at the level of the school itself. Novosibirsk municipality has given a high priority to an&#13;
initiative to develop planning and management systems, including a management information system, for&#13;
schools, but progress is very slow because of a lack of resources. Assistance for a management&#13;
development and management information systems component has, therefore, been included in the&#13;
project. Lessons learned in Novosibirsk municipality should prove applicable to later investments&#13;
throughout the oblast and in other oblasts as well.&#13;
B.    Organization of the Novosibirsk Municipal Department of Education&#13;
2.     The municipality has 188 daytime general schools and 182 pre-school institutions containing a&#13;
total of 1.3 million square meters of space. The organization and management of these schools and&#13;
institutions is highly decentralized. The municipal Department of Education has management and&#13;
oversight responsibilities for 10 Raion District offices to whom the directors of individual schools report.&#13;
In practice, each individual school director has extraordinary responsibilities for the operation of the&#13;
school, including instructional, administrative, maintenance, and custodial responsibilities. The burden&#13;
of these responsibilities is excessive and diminishes the ability of the school directors to provide&#13;
educational leadership.&#13;
3.    The functions of a comprehensive facilities planninU organization include forecasting student&#13;
enrollments, designing catchment areas for schools, and developing a capital improvement program of&#13;
at least five years' duration. These functions require sets of decisions that should be based upon&#13;
systematically-gathered information about demographic factors and the physical status of each school.&#13;
In Novosibirsk municipality, the planning function is carried out by two staff members--an economist and&#13;
a statistical assistant--but their role is limited. Student enrolment data are kept only at individual schools&#13;
and projections of enrollments are usually made only for the next year for each catchment area. These&#13;
projections are, in fact, based upon canvasses of homes in school catchment areas carried out by the&#13;
teachers themselves. These projections are used to estimate the materials and supplies required as well&#13;
as to make decisions about double and triple shifting. Projections of space requirements are made at the&#13;
oblast and municipality levels and are based upon norms, such as the number of places per 1000&#13;
population. Population projections, if they are made, are done by local academic institutions, but there&#13;
is no evidence that their findings are used in practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
98                                                                                  ANNEX 3.2&#13;
4.     In Novosibirsk municipality, school design. construction and rehabilitation are performed by a&#13;
seven-person unit headed by a Deputy Chief for Technical Supervision. The unit is responsible for&#13;
construction, repairs, supplies, site plans, and technical documentation. Subsidiary units are located at&#13;
the raion level and are largely concerned with major repairs. Staffing levels at the raion level are based&#13;
on norms. But, for budgetary reasons, all positions are not filled and the raion level units are considered&#13;
to be seriously understaffed. The standards for school design and the materials and building systems used&#13;
are governed by norms that are acknowledged to have been inappropriate in the first instance.&#13;
5.     There is no organization at the municipal or raion school administrative offices to perform,&#13;
manage, or monitor routine school maintenance activities. Routine maintenance is the responsibility of&#13;
the school director and /or deputy director, and is performed by two maintenance workers assigned to&#13;
each school. Maintenance materials and salaries are budgeted at the school. Requests for major repairs&#13;
that cannot be handled by school maintenance staff are initiated by school directors and forwarded to the&#13;
raion administration and the municipal Department of Education. Occasionally these requests are sent to&#13;
the oblast department of education.&#13;
6.     The custodial function in schools is also managed by school directors. Custodial staffing is&#13;
governed by established 'norms' that are seldom met. Children help clean their classrooms. The&#13;
buildings are intensively utilized since almost all of the schools are double shifted (8:30 am to 1:30 pm&#13;
and 2:00 pm to 6:30 pm). Some schools are triple shifted. Because of their intensive utilization, schools&#13;
ar.  very difficult to keep clean. No formal custodial training and/or inspection is undertaken by the raion&#13;
or city school administrative offices.&#13;
7.    Information technology (computers) is a new responsibility of the city Education Department.&#13;
There is only one specialist overseeing this effort. The inventory and location of computers in the city&#13;
Department of Education is as follows:&#13;
Personnel                   2 IBM 286s&#13;
Economic Planning            I IBM 286&#13;
Curriculum/Innovation        I IBM 486&#13;
Accounting                   8 IBM 486s w/File Server (LAN)&#13;
Kindergarten                 I IBM 386&#13;
Director's Secretary         I IBM 486&#13;
8.     Except for accounting, computers are used for word processing and document preparation.&#13;
Accounting is the only function which uses computers for information storage, retrieval, and manipulation&#13;
for business systems applications.&#13;
C.    Problems&#13;
9.     There is no information base that would facilitate good system-wide decision-making. Instead&#13;
there are many micro-information bases mostly centered on individual schools, raion administrations and&#13;
the various offices in the municipal Department of Education. They are heterogeneous in form and&#13;
content and not accessible to each other. Access to information held in other locations is difficult and&#13;
time-consuming. There is no consolidated data base on historical or current year school enrollments.&#13;
Multi-year projections are not being made. Information on school capacities and other facility attributes&#13;
are not maintained. Most planning that now occur in the facilities area concerns finance. Methodologies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

for assigning priorities for rehabilitation and major repair work are being introduced under the project.&#13;
But a facilities data base containing the comprehensive physical attributes of all school buildings is needed&#13;
for the effective use and refinement of these methodologies.&#13;
10.   The design and construction of new schools, either as additional buildings to relieve overcrowding&#13;
or to replace inadequate facilities, is not occurring due to a lack of planning and funding. Previously&#13;
(under the Soviet system), this responsibility was centralized with little local control or involvement. Poor&#13;
design and quality of construction and years of under-investment in school facilities has lead to the current&#13;
overcrowding and poor condition of schools. The model school component (see Annex 3.4) will develop&#13;
improved educational specifications and school designs. The use of cost-effective construction materials&#13;
and methods will be demonstrated in the model school component.&#13;
11.   It was reported that the quality of construction and repair work performed is often not&#13;
satisfactory. Inspection and evaluation procedures must be developed and employed to assure an&#13;
acceptable quality of work.&#13;
12.   Maintenance of a complex school facility requires a broad base of trade skills, e.g. electrical,&#13;
plumbing, heating, carpentry, and masonry that are difficult, if not impossible, to find in one or two&#13;
maintenance personnel assigned to each school. Additionally, records of routine maintenance activities&#13;
and expenditures are not available at the city Department of Education. A preventive maintenance&#13;
program does not exist and a training program is needed. The methodology and organization of&#13;
maintenance activities needs to be examined. It appears that improved efficiency and effectiveness could&#13;
be achieved within the resources currently available.&#13;
13.    Poor construction and choice of surface materials makes cleaning very difficult. The major&#13;
problems observed in custodial/housekeeping activities are:&#13;
e     Inadequate cleaning equipment&#13;
3     Inadequate cleaning materials (chemicals)&#13;
3     Lack of training in proper cleaning methodologies&#13;
*     Lack of a creditable methodology for determining custodial staffing ('norms' are&#13;
not applicable to all schools)&#13;
14.   Computer technology does not exist to support the facilities planning, design and construction,&#13;
maintenance, and custodial activities at local schools, raions, or the city school administration.&#13;
Information is not available to facilitate good program management and/or decision making.&#13;
II. ASSISTANCE TO BE PROVIDED UNDER THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives of the Component&#13;
15. This component of the project is designed to establish a management information system for school&#13;
facilities planning, investments, program and project implementation and school maintenance in&#13;
Novosibirsk municipality, as a pilot to be evaluated. Based upon lessons learned, this would be modified,&#13;
and extended throughout the municipality. Sufficient resources are included in the component to launch&#13;
a municipality-wide implementation of the systems designed and piloted under the project. When the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
100                                                                              ANNEX 3.2&#13;
component is completed, almost all schools, all 10 raion school administrations and the municipal&#13;
Department of Education should be linked in a network. However, the precise specifications of these&#13;
systems are to be determined by tasks undertaken by consultants at the initial stages of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
B. Tasks&#13;
Task 1 - Management System Study&#13;
16.   Prior to any efforts to design a management information system to support school facilities&#13;
activities, a management study should be undertaken to examine current processes and make&#13;
recommendations regarding:&#13;
*     Organization&#13;
*     Staffing&#13;
*     Funding&#13;
*     Economic analysis&#13;
*     Management processes and decision making&#13;
Information (availability, needs, generation, storage, retrieval, distribution, etc.)&#13;
=     Training&#13;
17.   This task would require the efforts of two system management analysts, who should be familiar&#13;
with the best practices in facilities management methodologies and processes, for approximately six weeks&#13;
to assist with the preparation of a multi-year transitional strategy. Proposals must reflect Russian social&#13;
and organizational culture, rather than directly transplanting foreign systems.&#13;
Task 2 - Management Information System Study&#13;
18.   The recommended second task of this sub-component is a management information system study.&#13;
This task should overlap Task I by approximately two weeks to facilitate information transfer and task&#13;
coordination. This study effort should include and make recommendations regarding:&#13;
e     Technology needs in Facilities and its integration into a city-wide MIS&#13;
*     System configuration&#13;
*     Systems Software&#13;
*     Applications Software&#13;
*     Hardware - existing/new&#13;
*     Data base configuration&#13;
*     Staffing/Personnel&#13;
*     Telecommunications Issues - WAN connectivity&#13;
*     Training&#13;
*     Costs/Economics&#13;
*     Implementation schedule&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.2                                                                               101&#13;
19.   It should be noted that the city Department of Education is currently considering a letter of intent&#13;
with Apple computer for cooperation in the area of technology. The terms, conditions and intent of this&#13;
"feasibility" study could not be ascertained.&#13;
20.    A rough concept of a MIS configuration emerged in discussions with the city Department of&#13;
Education. This concept should be considered during the Task 2 MIS Study effort. The concept included&#13;
development of a MIS local area network within the City Department of Education Administrative&#13;
Building, connected via data lines to 2 to 3 computers in the raion administrative offices to form a&#13;
wide-area network. A computer would also be installed in the Administrative office at each school with&#13;
dial-up connectivity via modem to the raion offices. The initial efforts in the utilization of this conceptual&#13;
data network would be to facilitate better availability of information and management of school facilities,&#13;
particularly maintenance and major repairs.&#13;
Task 3 - Study Tours&#13;
21.   To assist in training and knowledge transfer in the area of information technology, study tours&#13;
would be organized for selected individuals in the city Department of Education Administration. School&#13;
districts in the United States, Canada, or Finland, that demonstrate good school facilities management&#13;
organizations and practices and the use of information technology in school facilities management would&#13;
be visited. The study tour would involve 5 to 6 city school administrators visiting 3 school districts. Visits&#13;
to private enterprises that provide technology services would be included. The duration of the study tour&#13;
should be approximately two weeks.&#13;
Task 4 - Consultation and Planning System Design of Pilot&#13;
22.    Following the study tours, consultants will work with municipal officials on a plan that would,&#13;
in the first instance, determine responsibilities for various functions in school facilities planning and&#13;
management. In a cooperative and consultative process, data needs for the performance of these functions&#13;
would be discussed and agreed. A plan would be agreed for gradual transition to the new system. The&#13;
plan would include substantial provision for training all of those responsible for using and maintaining&#13;
the system.&#13;
Task 5 - Implementation of Pilot&#13;
23.    A data base would be designed and local consultants hired to establish the base in the first&#13;
instance and to create new software, or to modify existing software that will provide access to the data&#13;
base on a network and to permit routine statistical analysis and data manipulation. Hardware would be&#13;
installed, tested, and evaluated for a small portion of the total network, perhaps two raions with 40&#13;
schools and the municipal administration. Training would be provided for users of the MIS. Evaluation&#13;
protocol would include the effectiveness of training and acceptance of the use of technology.&#13;
Understanding and user acceptance of installed applications software should be evaluated.&#13;
24.   The MIS component would finance as many as 85 high-end PCs with appropriate file servers,&#13;
communication devices, and data lines that are to defined in the systems configuration portions of the&#13;
Task 2 study effort.&#13;
&#13;

Task 6 - Development of Systems Implementation Plan&#13;
25.   Based on the experiences through Task 5, and particularly the test and evaluation data,&#13;
modifications to the management information systems hardware and software configurations would be&#13;
made. Following this re-engineering effort, a sequenced implementation plan for the city-wide network&#13;
would be developed.&#13;
Task 7 - Progressive Implementation of Citywide Program&#13;
26.   Based on availability of resources, staff training, and organizational readiness, implementation&#13;
of the city-wide network should proceed in accordance with the implementation plan developed in Task&#13;

ANNEX 3.3&#13;
SELECTION CRITERIA AND MODEL APPRAISAL&#13;
FOR HEALTH SUBPROJECTS&#13;
A. SELECTION CRITERIA&#13;
Hospitals must meet the following criteria in order to be considered for the project:&#13;
(a)    City and central raion hospitals must qualify as "general hospitals" as that term is understood in&#13;
Western terminology.&#13;
Rationale:&#13;
(i)    These hospitals are the mainstay of the system  and deal with the majority of the&#13;
population. Outside the main cities, these hospitals, usually configured with an adjacent&#13;
polyclinic, are the only medical facilities available to the population.&#13;
(ii)    Accordingly, these facilities deal with the main causes of morbidity and preventable&#13;
mortality: cardiovascular problems and trauma.&#13;
(iii)   Improved functioning of these hospitals should reduce hospitalization in upper-level&#13;
facilities, such as oblast hospitals that, although often better equipped, do not use&#13;
different care by approach and technology than that found in lower level facilities.&#13;
(b)    Hospitals must be centrally located and easily accessible and must serve a population of at least&#13;
50,000 (and must be expected to continue to serve such a population in the future).&#13;
Rationale: These criteria are intended to assure that facilities selected are needed and can operate&#13;
efficiently, the premises being that a population of this size requires hospital facilities and that&#13;
the minimal hospital size, from an efficiency perspective, is 250 to 300 acute beds.&#13;
(c)    Hospitals must have high levels of utilization--i.e an occupancy rate of above 90%.&#13;
Rationale: This criterion is intended to assure that the facilities selected are the ones most needed&#13;
and used.&#13;
(d)    Hospitals must be in need of rehabilitation and upgrading (as per the proposed functional&#13;
specifications described in this Annex and other project documents) of their: (i) emergency cum&#13;
admission units, including ambulances; (ii) intensive care units; (iii) operating theaters; (iv)&#13;
laboratories; and (v) X-ray and imaging units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
104                                                                                    ANNEX 3.3&#13;
Rationale:&#13;
(i)    These components constitute the "core" of a general hospital and are necessary for proper&#13;
management of patients, especially those in trauma and those suffering from&#13;
cardiovascular problems.&#13;
(ii)    This core, the laboratories cum X-Ray and imaging services in particular, serves the&#13;
entire hospital, as well as peripheral facilities in the community.&#13;
(iii)    A well-functioning core can provide more effective and efficient care, saving lives and&#13;
reducing the need for hospitalization at all levels.&#13;
(e)    Hospitals must have a number of emergency patients which is higher than the oblast average in&#13;
need of intensive care (with priority to the highest number).&#13;
Rationale. Given Russian morbidity and mortality patterns, these facilities can contribute most&#13;
to years of life saved.&#13;
(f)    Hospitals must have access to, in order of priority: a water supply, heating, sewage, and&#13;
electricity with priority given to facilities which have all the above.&#13;
Rationale. These elements of infrastructure are necessary for hospitals to function as hospitals&#13;
rather than as poor hotels.&#13;
(g)    Improved functioning of the hospital must result in reduction in beds both within the hospital&#13;
itself and in existing, nearby facilities.&#13;
Rationale: The objective here is to support downsizing of Russian hospital beds, which are&#13;
excessive by familiar standards.&#13;
(h)    The hospital does not have fundamental structural problems that would classify it as dangerous&#13;
by Russian building codes.&#13;
(i)    The hospital facility should be most flexible in terms of layout and design and be amenable to&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading, e.g., horizontal, single or two-floor, spread-out. Facilities are given&#13;
priority over narrow and high structures.&#13;
Rationale: For the same objective, the investment in spread-out facilities is smaller than that in&#13;
narrow, vertical structures, as patients need to be moved to upper floors.&#13;
(j)    Hospital management and staff must be amenable to adoption of new technology and functional&#13;
reorganization.&#13;
2.     For polyclinics, the following criteria were established:&#13;
(a)    (Urban) Independent polyclinics must have the capacity, in terms of space and location, to serve&#13;
as diagnostic centers for a network of existing polyclinics, all serving a population of&#13;
approximately 300,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.3                                                                                 105&#13;
Rationale:&#13;
(i)    Such polyclinics could substantially improve care in the community and reduce the need&#13;
for hospitalization.&#13;
(ii)    Services in the community would be more efficient due to a more rational allocation and&#13;
use of expensive equipment.&#13;
(iii)   The facilities could attract qualified personnel to care for the community and provider&#13;
training.&#13;
(b)    Rural polyclinics, which are usually adjacent to a raion hospital, must meet the general criterion&#13;
set for hospitals.&#13;
Rationale.- Rural polyclinics, which depend upon their adjacent hospitals for nearly all services,&#13;
cannot be looked upon as units separate from those hospitals and, therefore, need to be upgraded&#13;
as diagnostic centers serving the entire population.&#13;
3.     The above comprise a basic set of criteria; they will need to be refined, primarily in light of cost&#13;
and other feasibility considerations. Criteria for the community participation will eventually be added.&#13;
4.    It is noteworthy that, at this stage, no explicit effort is being made to establish criteria for&#13;
selecting between hospitals and polyclinics. This approach is being taken because, at least in rural areas,&#13;
hospitals and polyclinics are handled as a single entity providing a continuum of care. Essentially the&#13;
same approach is adopted for cities as far as "first line" hospitals are concerned. If well organized and&#13;
equipped, the city hospitals and polyclinics would be complementary rather than substitutes.&#13;
B. APPRAISAL OF PROPOSED HEALTH SUBPROJECT&#13;
REHABILITATION OF CHEREPANOVO CENTRAL RAION HOSPITAL AND POLYCLINIC&#13;
Type of Facility:                   General Hospital&#13;
Population Served:                  About 60,000&#13;
Present conditions of facilities:&#13;
I .    Structure&#13;
(a)    Without major structural repairs, part of the building will collapse.&#13;
(b)    Floors are not linked to structure of building, leading to their sinking.&#13;
(c)    Poor insulation of buildings in spite of harsh weather conditions. Most insulation is achieved&#13;
through wide external walls without added, relatively inexpensive covers either on the internal&#13;
or external walls. This is particularly notable in brick structures.&#13;
(d)    Wooden floors without appropriate drainage, leading to inability to keep them clean and sterile,&#13;
and to rotting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
106                                                                                ANNEX 3.3&#13;
2.     Utilities&#13;
(a)    Water. There are no water reservoirs; a breakdown in the municipal water systems&#13;
leaves medical facilities without water supply. Water is not treated. There is no 'reverse&#13;
osmosis' system  for 'soft water' needed for babies, and instruments.  No on-site&#13;
chlorination is available; water is chlorinated to the extent that it goes through the central&#13;
municipal system.&#13;
(b)    Sewage.  Central sewage systems are uncommon. There is a paucity of toilets and&#13;
showers for both staff and patients.&#13;
(c)    Air-conditioning and ventilation. Air-conditioning is inadequate for fresh air, especially&#13;
during the cold winters. Air-conditioning, when available, is usually not situated for&#13;
most effective operation. Most facilities lack centralized oxygen, compressed air, and&#13;
suction systems.  In operating rooms, no suction systems are available to remove&#13;
anaesthetic gases that could affect physician performance.&#13;
(d)    Heating. Heating systems depend on the municipal system which may be unreliable.&#13;
Especially where patients undress, unsafe electrical wall units were observed.&#13;
(e)    Gases. Compressed air needed for resuscitation equipment is generated in Russia by&#13;
compressors which are part of the equipment. This system is rather inefficient compared&#13;
with centralized gas, including oxygen, lines, the standard in the West.&#13;
(f)    Utility lines. There are virtually no utility lines (gases, power, and communication)&#13;
reaching the patient's bed.&#13;
3.     Electro-mechanical Systems&#13;
(a)    Electrical backup. Numerous care systems depend upon electricity for operation. These&#13;
include monitoring, operating, and resuscitation systems. Consequently, diesel generators&#13;
are needed as a backup power supply, with critical added UPS element that responds&#13;
instantly (0.5 second) to power failure and operate until the diesel generator supply takes&#13;
over. None of the hospitals visited had the necessary backup mechanism. Rather than&#13;
common diesel backup, the common power supply to the hospital emanates from two&#13;
different electrical sources or lines (each of which contains a voltage of 6kV). Each line&#13;
can back up the other. In case of an electrical failure in one line, the second line replaces&#13;
the first. Still both lines depend on city systems.&#13;
(b)    Each main switch-board in each floor receives its power supply from the two city&#13;
sources. The transfer from one line to the other is done by a manual switch-over which&#13;
takes time, precious in many instances for patients in intensive care or being operated.&#13;
There are some critical loads in which the transfer is done automatically. Some city&#13;
hospitals have generators that are below required capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.3                                                                                     107&#13;
(c)    The electrical system  in special medical rooms, such as in intensive care, operating&#13;
rooms, and in dialysis, are not built in accordance with codes common in the West; the&#13;
reliability of the electrical system is exceptionally low.&#13;
(d)    Grounding etc. Lacking in many instances are: an anti-static system on floors, grounding&#13;
(up to 0.2 OMS) and circuit breakers to avoid electromagnetic disturbances which affect&#13;
instruments, and explosions, especially in laboratories.&#13;
(e)    Lighting. Lighting is usually very poor even in operating rooms.&#13;
4.     Safety and Quality Assurance&#13;
(a)    Safety and general quality encompass (i) safety of patients, (ii)safety of personnel&#13;
processing tests, and (iii) safety of the public at-large in connection with disposal of&#13;
materials.  It was observed that these issues are highly disregarded.  In general,&#13;
structures are not divided so as to provide protection in case of fire, gas leaks, etc.; there&#13;
are no fire zones with special regulations, and there are no special doors to seal areas in&#13;
case of emergency. Electrical wiring is often exposed, endangering both patients and&#13;
personnel.&#13;
(b)    Electricity. Electrical switch-boards in the hospitals are in bad condition. The equipment&#13;
used is old, and spare parts are not available. The switch-boards situation is particularly&#13;
dangerous.&#13;
(c)    Radiation, and biological and chemical waste. In the case of laboratories and imaging&#13;
units, personnel, patients, and the general public are at risk, mainly because of the non-&#13;
use of high quality disposables, ineffective control of radiation, protection from radiation,&#13;
lack of electrical grounding, and inappropriate handling and disposal of biological&#13;
materials.&#13;
(d)    No facilities are available next to the laboratories for showering in case of contamination.&#13;
(e)    Fire. Neither smoke and fire detection systems nor sprinkler systems were observed.&#13;
Doors are not designed to open outward to facilitate escape in case of fire.&#13;
5.     Situation Without Project. Part of the hospital is already closed for safety reasons, and the&#13;
remainder would soon need to be closed.&#13;
6.     Principles of Redesign and Reconstruction&#13;
(a)    Overview. The subproject will encompass the following units:&#13;
(i)    Emergency and admission room&#13;
(ii)   Intensive care unit&#13;
(iii)   Operating room&#13;
(iv)    Central Laboratory&#13;
(v)    Central X-ray and imaging facility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108                                                                                ANNEX 3.3&#13;
(b)    The subproject will include some upgrading of wards, which will be accommodated under&#13;
the project. This core unit is planned as a continuum on the floor to comply with&#13;
management of patients common in the West.&#13;
(c)    All service units would be supported by appropriate infrastructure pertaining to structure,&#13;
water and sewage, electro-mechanical systems, and air-conditioning and ventilation.&#13;
Systems would be designed in a way that would enable rehabilitation and upgrading of&#13;
the same facilities in the future with more finance becoming available.&#13;

(ii)    Vacuum and pressurized air pumps&#13;
(iii)    Water tank&#13;
(iv)    Diesel generator (250 KVA)&#13;

I. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
Baseline Situation&#13;
8.     Medical waste in the hospital can be grouped into the following categories:&#13;
-      medical waste which is burned without primary disinfection (plastics except syringes;&#13;
bandages; rubber (gloves, catheter,etc.); others). They are burned in the hospital boiler.&#13;
-      medical waste which is sterilized and goes to the sewage system (blood, urine, etc.).&#13;
-      medical waste which goes to the sewage system without primary disinfection (reactives).&#13;
-      "reusable" medical waste - medical waste which is used after disinfection and washing&#13;
(part of bandages used in the units (except bandages of surgery and infection units). This&#13;
occurs because the facility does not have enough money for new supplies.&#13;
-      X-ray films and development solution are collected during the period of a year and once&#13;
a year are taken to a special factory for processing and extracting silver.&#13;
9.     Syringes are disinfected and chlorinated in the treatment room where there is a sterilization unit.&#13;
They are removed from the hospital monthly. During the month they are stored in a special room (with&#13;
strict accounting). There are special rooms for storage in all units.&#13;
10.    The hazard level is identified according to the level of toxic chemicals (chrome, mercury,&#13;
cadmium, plumbum, etc.) and the level of infectious substitutes (pathogenies bacteria, viruses, etc.). The&#13;
following substances are regarded as most hazardous (those included in Classes I and II of the Russian&#13;
classification of hazardous substances):&#13;
Chemicals             :      selen, dioxin, benzophuran, etc.&#13;
Bacteria pollution    :      hepatitis, AIDS, TB, plague, etc.&#13;
11.   It should be noted that toxic substances and hazardous bacteria can transform in any environment&#13;
(water, air, soil) and thus, generate more toxic substances, and can also accumulate in soil, plants, etc.&#13;
12.   In the case of laboratories and imaging units, personnel, patients and the general public are at&#13;
risk, mainly because of the non-use of high quality disposables, ineffective control of radiation, protection&#13;
from radiation, and lack of electrical grounding.&#13;
13.    In all project hospitals, storage and utilization of medical waste are identical. It should be noted&#13;
that the waste discussed above is handled in almost an identical manner in the West, in accordance with&#13;
the strictest regulations.&#13;
Regulatory and Institutional Considerations&#13;
14.   In the Russian Federation, the State Committee on the Epidemiological and Sanitary Surveillance&#13;
is responsible for development, approval and monitoring of the state sanitary codes.1' This Committee&#13;
!' Before 1991, State Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance Service was institutionally under the Federal Ministry of&#13;
Health of the USSR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.3                                                                                    111&#13;
comprises oblast and rayon sanitary and epidemiological stations (SES) which are responsible for&#13;
monitoring sanitary codes and environmental aspects of the medical facilities' activities at the local&#13;
(community) level. SES of the Cherepanovsky raion (Novosibirsk oblast) is responsible for monitoring&#13;
sanitary codes and environmental aspects of the Cherepanovo Central Raion Hospital.&#13;
15.    At the facility level, as a rule, staffing positions include positions for professionals responsible&#13;
for monitoring environmental and safety aspects of the management of care.&#13;
16.    The environmental and safety issues can be divided according to the following functioning&#13;
categories: construction, management of care, and waste control. While the first two concern mainly the&#13;
'one-time' construction and equipping processes with follow-up periodic maintenance and adherence to&#13;
regulations, waste control is a daily activity requiring careful regulation and monitoring.&#13;
17.    The different issues are stipulated in the following Russian regulatory documents':&#13;
(a)    "Manual on the Design of Medical Facilities", Ministry of Health of the USSR, approved&#13;
by the Director of the Central Health Design Institute, 1989.&#13;
(b)    "Sanitary Regulations on the Establishment, Equipment and Maintenance of Hospitals,&#13;
Maternity Hospitals and Other Medical Facilities." ("SanPiN 5179-90"), Ministry of&#13;
Health of the USSR, approved by the Chief Sanitary Doctor of the USSR, 1990.&#13;
(c)    Order of the Ministry of Health of the USSR (N520), 1981.&#13;
"Sanitary Regulations for Maintenance of Settlements" (N4690-88), 1988.&#13;
18.   In general, Russian "sanitary codes" governing environmental issues are strict and probably fall&#13;
in line with those common in the West for comparable technologies, as exemplified below with regard&#13;
to practices in medical facilities. At the same time, the general impression is that compliance with&#13;
regulations is low; in no facility could the person in charge of environmental and safety issues be&#13;
identified.&#13;
19.    Within the above general categories, medical waste management is probably the main issue in&#13;
Russian facilities today. There is no unified technological system of storage and utilization of medical&#13;
waste in Russia. The main problems in this area are as follows:&#13;
(a)    there is no appropriate standard equipment for waste management;&#13;
(b)    in many cases there are no special rooms in medical facilities for waste storage;&#13;
(c)    medical waste is transported without any special packing and is taken to the general&#13;
community dump;&#13;
(d)    there is no system of processing medical waste in order to remove materials (plastic,&#13;
metal, etc.) which can be reused.&#13;
20.    According to Russian regulations, after being sterilized, all specific medical waste must be burnt&#13;
in special stoves. Disinfection of sewage in hospitals must be done within the general community sewage&#13;
2 There are more regulations concerning special types of medical waste such as radiological waste. These are not,&#13;
however, relevant to the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
112                                                                                     ANNEX 3.3&#13;
system by the regular city (rural rayon) sewage processing stations. None of these regulations (some of&#13;
which may be unnecessary) appear to be followed.3'&#13;
Environmental Impact of Proposals&#13;
21.    The project would improve the environmental aspects of medical facilities in Russia through the&#13;
choice of construction materials, design of medical units, and choice of equipment. Under the&#13;
rehabilitation, the plan is to build new rooms for discarding materials (emergency and admission room);&#13;
for storage of equipment and disposables (intensive care unit); sterilization, autoclave, storage of sterile&#13;
materials, for discarding materials, storage of equipment (X-ray and Respirators), storage of non-sterile&#13;
consumables (operating theater); for waste disposal (ward); storage for reagents, for disposal of biological&#13;
materials (autoclave, central laboratory), chemicals and films (X-ray and imaging department).&#13;
22.    The project will use insulation materials, which are almost non-existent in most Russian facilities,&#13;
for the following:&#13;
(a)    insulation against cold;&#13;
(b)    insulation of water and electrical supplies; and&#13;
(c)    insulation of walls and ceilings.&#13;
23.    Hazards appear when the materials are: toxic; toxic only when on fire (combustible); and&#13;
carcinogenic. For these reasons, materials used for construction of any of the above would not contain&#13;
substances like asbestos, MDF, nor polystyrene.&#13;
24.    Fire hazards would be minimized by the construction of walls that span the height of the room&#13;
to the ceiling, corridors which are not obstructed, heavy metal doors which limit each fire unit and&#13;
enables the containment of the fire. In each room doors would open to the exterior and safety switches&#13;
for electricity and gas inlets would be present in special niches outside each room. These features would&#13;
be enhanced by the presence of smoke alarms and sprinklers.&#13;
25.    The air in project units would be heated, cooled and ventilated with external air circulated and&#13;
vented. Care would be taken to filter out contaminants in problematic locations such as the Microbiology&#13;
laboratory. Amounts of C02 and CO would be monitored in closed areas and gases like Halothane and&#13;
N02 would be monitored in operating theaters since the hazards of these gases to personnel is well&#13;
documented. Measures are taken in the structure to secure that external air is not contaminated.&#13;
Mitigation and Enhancement&#13;
26.    In general it should be emphasized that specific pollution in medical institutions is generated either&#13;
by local power plants or waste spillage. Since in Russia, central city power plants deliver heating and&#13;
hot water, environmental control should be exercised over them. The health component recommends the&#13;
use of a diesel generator, of course complying with regulations, namely, its location, noise level&#13;
produced, and automatic fire extinguisher capacities.&#13;
3' For example, no special treatment is necessary for hospital sewage since the same bacteria are present in the&#13;
population at large. Specific contaminants are diluted by the total fluids generated at the sites and further diluted&#13;
and handled by the sewage of a city/raion. This rather natural process complies with the most rigorous standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.3                                                                               113&#13;
27.   Building materials used during construction would be stored on site. However,upon their disposal&#13;
after construction or after being torn down, they would be transferred to central city or raion dump sites.&#13;
Old pipes and other metal objects would be transferred to smelting sites. Machinery of medical nature&#13;
would first be dismantled, parts for secondary use would be recuperated, and metal parts would be&#13;
transferred to smelting sites.&#13;
28.    Radiation exists at three different sites:  X-Ray department, laboratory, and at the site of&#13;
radioisotope imaging and treatment. Of the three, the last is irrelevant to the project. Construction&#13;
standards and specification of equipment under the project are governed by pertinent concerns.&#13;
Recommended modern X-Ray equipment is designed to secure minimum radiation exposure to patients&#13;
and personnel. At the radioisotopes work sites, care would be taken for safety of personnel during&#13;
construction (lead shields).&#13;
29.   The construction codes for X-ray departments specify the amount of radiation generated by an&#13;
X-ray machine and leakage of such radiation. Employees would be protected through the use of lead&#13;
(plumbum) coverings in walls and partitions. Gowns containing lead and other devices would be used&#13;
for the protection of patients' reproductive organs, and finally, warning signs for pregnant women would&#13;
convey the danger of X-ray exposure.&#13;
30.   The personnel working in these sites would be protected by the use of tunics and gloves, as well&#13;
as specifically designed non absorbent surfaces on the furniture and floors. Monitoring of personnel&#13;
would be mandatory and achieved through the use of tags to detect X and Gamma radiation in conjunction&#13;
with monthly and annual checkups.&#13;
31.    Chemicals that may be hazardous by being carcinogenic or combustible/explosive would be used&#13;
under a Laminar flow cabinet and used only by qualified and "hazard aware" personnel. Chemicals would&#13;
be stored in a specially designed storage facility, keeping the former and latter separate. Storage and&#13;
handling would be according to common NFPA (National Fire Protection Association-Boston, USA) and&#13;
NCCLS (National Committee For Clinical Laboratory Standards, USA) standards.&#13;
32.   The disposal of medical waste would be accomplished as follows. Biological waste would be&#13;
disposed in two phases: (a) collection in departments and laboratories; and (b) transfer to central disposal&#13;
units after decontamination (usually performed by auto-clavization suggested as part of the project).&#13;
33.   The collection would be in special plastic containers mounted with heat resistant bags present in&#13;
sufficient quantities in each ward, unit, laboratory. Needles would be collected separately in special&#13;
plastic containers. Placement into the container would be performed in a manner such that the pricking&#13;
of personnel would be avoided. At the end of the day, biological waste would be collected and transferred&#13;
to a centrally located autoclave. After the autoclave, waste would be ground and delivered to a dump (the&#13;
regular community dump could be used as all materials are sterile, hence non-hazardous).&#13;
34.    The lack of regard for environmental concerns in Russian medical facilities visited by consultants&#13;
during project preparation has been apparent in structures, equipment, management of care, and waste&#13;
control.  One of the most important potential contributions of the project would be in training&#13;
professionals to be aware of environmental issues, and to follow pertinent regulations. Environmental&#13;
safety issues would be included in the curricula of all training under the project, in addition to training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
114                                                                                    ANNEX 3.3&#13;
given during installation of equipment and introduction of new technologies as part of the installation&#13;
process. Special training courses on environmental issues are not required.&#13;
II. ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT&#13;
35.    The economic evaluation of the project entails assessing the additional recurrent cost the project&#13;
would impose on the system, vis-a-vis the project's social benefits comprising the financial gains from&#13;
savings on cost of medical services, mainly hospitalization, plus improvement in length and quality of&#13;
life. That is, the social value of the project depends on the valuation of additional years of life and&#13;
improvement in their quality that ultimately cannot be reduced to any monetary equivalent except as a&#13;
political judgment.4' Consequently, the economic evaluation constitutes estimating the net present value&#13;
of the investment in the health component of the project, and contrasting this value with the project's&#13;
potential non-monetary benefits. Thereby the evaluation provides the data for the political judgment.&#13;
36.    The Central Raion Hospital, Cherepanovo, operates along with 8 other smaller facilities, all with&#13;
a total of 595 beds, in a raion of 55,000 population. This population is also served by the oblast hospital&#13;
in Novosibirsk. According to official data, the Central Raion Hospital is designed for 365 beds. It has&#13;
been operating 315 beds as it has been under renovation for some time and one of the wings has been&#13;
closed. It has been operating these beds with a length of stay of 12 days and 60% occupancy rate, and&#13;
an annual budget of US$1.03 million (1994)1', reflecting an annual cost per available bed of US$3,175.&#13;
37.    By the hospital management's own assessment (provided it is not budgeted by the number of&#13;
beds), the hospital could operate well with 200 beds, two-thirds of its current size, with modern&#13;
equipment. This is true, as discussed below, for the system at large. It is expected, therefore, that&#13;
operating as a central rural facility with modern diagnostic and therapeutic facilities serving the entire&#13;
raion, the hospital can reduce the number of beds serving the entire population of 55,000, estimated at&#13;
770 beds, by one-third or by 256 beds. This would amount to an annual savings of $812,800 (256 x&#13;
1' The impact on net health care costs is also difficult to measure since this requires a somewhat speculative&#13;
assessment of what would have happened without the project. Several of the building are in danger of&#13;
collapse, and there is a prospect of a total loss of service. Such an assessment, however, is unnecessary in&#13;
view of the project's efforts to upgrade and modernize facilities and not just to prevent further deterioration.&#13;
51 Because of the state of the hospital, it is hard to assess the accuracy of these statistics. Complicated cases,&#13;
requiring longer and more extensive examination and treatment are transferred to oblast facilities in the city&#13;
of Novosibirsk. No data are available on such transfers. Russian averages are 14 beds per 1000 and an&#13;
average length of stay of 17 days (1991-92). The relevant averages of the European members of the OECD&#13;
are 9 beds per 1000 capita with an average length of stay of 12 (Schieber, G.J., Poullier, J.P. and&#13;
Greenwald, L.M., "Health Performance in OECD Countries: 1980-1992). It is argued that contrary to&#13;
these averages, the corresponding Russian data of 14 and 17, do not include beds for long-term care, mainly&#13;
for the aged, that by-and-large do not exist in Russia to the extend known in the West (Chemichovsky, D.,&#13;
Barnum, H. Potapchik, E., and Tulchinsky, T., "Health Sector Reform in Russia". Mimeo. World Bank,&#13;
1994).&#13;

$3,175).Y Part of this savings would be incurred through better outpatient services and a lesser need to&#13;
refer patient to treatment in oblast facilities outside the raion.&#13;

6' Based on Russian national averages, this figure assumes that the raion is using the equivalent of additional&#13;
175 beds in oblast facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116                                                                                  ANNEX 3.3&#13;
39.    The net present value (NPV) of the investment in the hospitals is based on a discount rate of&#13;
15%, 10 years until the project comes to full fruition, and 5 years until the additional cost are fully&#13;
realized. Given the benefits mentioned above, an investment of about $5 million plus additional annual&#13;
running cost of $0.37 million, the NPV is $(- 3.94) million. This means the population will have an&#13;
additional imputed recurrent cost of about $11 annually per capita (15% of $3.94 million for 55,000&#13;
capita) or about 18% increase over current spending. This would be the price of the non monetary&#13;
benefits from improved health associated with this particular facility, the potential of which is discussed&#13;
below.&#13;
40.    Simulating on a system-wide basis, assume that each hospitalization day costs, as at Cherepanovo,&#13;
about $11, based on an occupancy rate of 85%, and the Russian average of about 14 beds per 1,000&#13;
capita. Assume further that over a period of 5-10 years the modern technology implemented under the&#13;
project can reduce the length of stay by 30%, from 17 days to 12, and the number of beds by 35%, from&#13;
14 to 9 per 1000 population. Taken together, these data also mean that 10% of patients currently treated&#13;
in hospitals would be treated in the community, including treatment on an outpatient basis.2' On these&#13;
assumptions the number of beds serving a catchment area of 300,000 could be reduced from 4,200 to&#13;
2,730 and the 90% of the population currently hospitalized would be served spend 12 days, on the&#13;
average, in hospitalsY  This saving of 1,470 beds, would lead to annual savings of $5.0 million. The&#13;
present discounted values of these cost savings from the project for the system at large, by different&#13;
periods of fruition, are as follows:&#13;
Dis.   :      Years to fruition&#13;
Rate   :      5       7.5    10&#13;
US$ millions&#13;
15%    :      23.45  20.01  17.26&#13;
41.   It is estimated that the additional running cost of supplies and materials for the project would be&#13;
mainly those associated with the new and expensive laboratory and imaging equipment. They would&#13;
amount to $3.6 million in hospitals (ten-fold over the Central Raion Hospital in Cherepanovo) and about&#13;
7 This last figure is based on the identity: admissions = beds*365*occupancy rate/average length of stay.&#13;
Reduction in the number of beds by 35% and in the average length of stay by 30%, suggest about 9% fewer&#13;
hospital admissions, assuming identical occupancy rates in western Europe and in Russia.&#13;
s These are upper estimates for the potential reduction in beds. Given that Russian data do not include long-&#13;
term beds which are included in European data, the reduction in beds and length of stay can be even greater&#13;
than suggested here, up to 6 beds per thousand for general acute beds that are comparable to Russian&#13;
statistics. Further reductions, however, are not stipulated here because all reductions would require training&#13;
part of which is not included in the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.3                                                                                    117&#13;
$730,000 per polyclinic, for a total of $4.3 million.9' In other words, once the full reforms have been&#13;
achieved there is an annual recurrent cost saving. The higher running costs are likely to be incurred&#13;
before the hospital savings are fully made. Here again, if the new cost levels are reached in full after&#13;
5 years, the present discounted value of this amount, at a 15% discount rate, is $20 million.&#13;
42.    It can be seen that if the hospitalization savings were realized in 7.5 years there would be no net&#13;
recurrent cost. If a lower discount rate--for example that used to repay the World Bank--there would&#13;
even less of a recurrent cost. Even in the worst case scenario, with full hospital cost savings not achieved&#13;
for ten years, the present value of the additional running cost is only $2.9 million, or less than $10 per&#13;
head.  The cost of the improved services are principally the capital costs. On the basis of the&#13;
Cherepanovo and Rostov data, upgrading the entire hospital and polyclinic facilities serving a population&#13;
of 300,000, would be $60 to 70 million. Assuming the higher figure and using an interest rate of 15%,&#13;
this amounts to an annual cost of $35 per beneficiary. Using an interest rate of 7.5 %, roughly equivalent&#13;
to the rate on the World Bank loan, this amounts to an annual payment of about $18 per head of the&#13;
beneficiary population, or about 30% above current expenditure per capita.&#13;
43.    As demonstrated in Table 3.4.3, the potential for health improvement in the two project areas is&#13;
dramatic. The difference in life expectancy between Europe and both oblasts is dramatic, especially for&#13;
males in Novosibirsk. This difference cannot, of course, be attributed solely to differences in medical&#13;
care, but much of it is related to trauma and cardiovascular disease, on which project-financed facilities&#13;
can have a very marked effect, especially in age groups 15 to 60. (This can, in turn, raise productivity&#13;
and the economic returns to education. Quality of life would improve as well. These very substantial&#13;
benefits need to be valued against the annual project cost per capita inputted above.)&#13;
44.    Sustainability. Recurrent or running costs are presented above. These costs should be covered&#13;
substantially through savings in hospital cost and in the longer-term by gains in income and productivity.&#13;
These are incremental cost to the operations of the polyclinics and hospitals.&#13;
45.    Maintenance of Equipment and Supplies. As for equipment, the issues are affordability and&#13;
availability of regular maintenance and supplies, especially in view of the harsh economic circumstances.&#13;
Maintenance at the operator level at the local site would be achieved relatively easily with Russian know-&#13;
how and skill. Maintenance beyond this level may be an issue and needs to be secured. It is suggested&#13;
that under the project, suppliers of equipment (preferably a single one per oblast and beyond) would be&#13;
contractually committed to (a) "down time," namely, the time during which the supplier must repair non&#13;
operative equipment, (b) to a minimum quantity of spare parts it must maintain in Russia/Oblast, and (c)&#13;
to train and retain a local maintenance capability. As for supplies, it is clear that because of the general&#13;
economic conditions, and the need to establish new types and sources of supplies, it is essential that those&#13;
are secured initially through the project. It is proposed that under their contracts, suppliers of equipment&#13;
would be contracted for supplies for several years in a declining fashion, to allow the system to adjust.&#13;
2' This is an overstatement since current laboratory and imaging cost are disregarded. Depreciation and&#13;
interest costs are not considered as added costs because although not budgeted, they are equally present on&#13;
the current building and on existing equipment. It should be stressed, however, that, as discussed elsewhere,&#13;
these costs should be incorporated in the budgets or other compensation systems of facilities, and be used to&#13;
finance investments.&#13;

46.   No maintenance guidelines were found in the hospital. A general observation is that while&#13;
engineers and technicians are available in some facilities, they were not in others. Even when present,&#13;
the mix of expertise is not consistent; in some instances it is a building engineer and in another it is an&#13;
electrician, and so on. The general impression is that maintenance is not routine, but done only when&#13;
things breakdown. This situation must change under the project to sustain the renovated and upgraded&#13;
units. The solution to this issue may be easily found, given Russian expertise in hiring and training the&#13;
right people with the mix of skills needed in a hospital.&#13;
47.    Sustainability is not simply a question of meeting recurrent costs and providing routine&#13;
maintenance, but also of new skills and methods of work. For example medical staff will need to work&#13;
at a different pace and at different modalities; (b) acquire new technologies and to maintain abreast new&#13;
developments; and (c) overcome structural and institutional relationships whereby lower level facilities&#13;
depend now on upper level facilities, notably Oblast hospitals and special institutes. There is probably&#13;
least problem with technology. In general, Russian personnel and professionals have been aware of their&#13;
lagging technology and need. As for the other issues, it is possible to find Russian models that come&#13;
close to the rehabilitation concept and program proposed here. Training is provided under the project&#13;
to deal with these issues (see para. 3.34, Chapter III).&#13;
48.   Implementation.!'- Functional, architectural and engineering designs will be developed as part&#13;
of project preparation. The schedule is as follows for these pilot facilities:&#13;
(a)    develop a general functional and engineering manual with specifications of design and&#13;
engineering requirements for general hospitals (by end of May 1995);&#13;
(b)    develop an architectural and engineering designs according to common practice in the&#13;
west (by end of May 1995); and&#13;
(c)    adapt the designs to Russian specifications while training Russian architects and engineers&#13;
to develop designs which synthesize the common practice and specification of the west&#13;
with Russian (end of June 1995).&#13;
Contracting for Equipment&#13;
49.   In principle the project should promote competition among different suppliers as a way to enhance&#13;
quality of product and service. Unfortunately, this may not be a realistic option in Russia at this stage.&#13;
The project needs to secure continued service to the equipment procured under the project. Given the&#13;
limited size of the project, it would not be reasonable to require of suppliers to retain on-site regional&#13;
maintenance capacity and stocks of spare parts (e.g. imaging, laboratories).&#13;
50.   Therefore, the approach taken under the project is to contract all equipment in each region to&#13;
single suppliers, but within general equipment categories and specifying the minimum contract size that&#13;
would justify local service. For example, biochemical lab equipment will be tendered separately from&#13;
chemical lab equipment. In each case an effort will be made to tender the minimum size for which it is&#13;
reasonable to secure local service. This may bring in competition after all, as most often suppliers of&#13;
one type of equipment supply the other type as well.&#13;
E This model appraisal anticipated a faster start to implementation than proved feasible.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
120                                                                                ANNEX 3.3&#13;
51.   Installation of Equipment. The installation of equipment, especially for laboratory, needs an&#13;
on-site engineer for adjustment of infrastructure and exact location of equipment. For X-ray and imaging&#13;
equipment this service is rendered by the suppliers. Budget and contracts for civil works needed for&#13;
installation would also be secured (5% of construction cost), separately from the procurement of&#13;
equipment. Suppliers usually supervise the installation of equipment.&#13;
52.    Timetables and Sequencing. With work beginning in April 1995, a possible implementation&#13;
schedule is given below. The purpose is to indicate the lengths of time required for each stage, rather&#13;
than to provide a firm timetable.&#13;

APPENDIX&#13;
POTENT'IAL FOR COST SAVING THROUGH REDUCTION IN HOSPITAL STAYS&#13;
A.    Medical Concepts and Practice in Facilities Visited by Mission&#13;
1.    During the course of studying different medical facilities, efforts were made to differentiate&#13;
between a lack of resources and the existence of a non-western approach to care that, although possibly&#13;
effective, might be interpreted as inappropriate. It is acknowledged here that approach to care implicates&#13;
fundamental issues that do not necessarily relate to availability of resources; nonetheless, the effectiveness&#13;
of the Russian approach observed is considered here. It is noted that the discussion is based upon visits&#13;
to selected facilities and that the situations studied may not be representative of the two oblasts or for&#13;
Russia as a whole.&#13;
Primary Care: City and Other Community Polyclinics&#13;
2.    Primary care in Russia is delivered in polyclinics, where individuals seek and encounter the&#13;
primary physician. The population approaching the polyclinic often comes with the following problems:&#13;
cardiovascular diseases, e.g., hypertension, coronary heart diseases; lung diseases, e.g., chronic&#13;
bronchitis, asthma, pneumonia; minor trauma; and malignancies.&#13;
3.    In the large cities, the administrative organization of polyclinics follows the administrative&#13;
organization of the city. The city is divided into "raions" with populations of about 300,000 each. The&#13;
polyclinics may be free-standing or part of a hospital. In rural areas the polyclinic is usually associated&#13;
with the hospital.&#13;
4.    In each city raion there are between 3 to 4 polyclinics for adults and at least one children's&#13;
polyclinic. The adult and children polyclinics form two identical and parallel systems differing mainly&#13;
in size and some specialties. Above these polyclinics, hierarchically, in each rayon there is a dual&#13;
purpose polyclinic which serves both as the primary care provider for the population in its catchment area&#13;
as well as the site for trauma treatment and specialized medicine for the entire rayon.&#13;
5.     This polyclinic, open 24 hours a day, is equipped with limited X-ray and imaging equipment,&#13;
usually on the ground floor that enables images to be taken without transportation of patients to an upper&#13;
floor, as most building do not have elevators. Specialists in these polyclinics are assigned according to&#13;
predefined standards according to the size of different sub-populations. In Polyclinic No. I in the city&#13;
of Rostov, for example, the following specialists are available: urologist, surgeon/orthopedist,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
122                                                                                    ANNEX 3.3&#13;
ophthalmologist, E.N.T. (eye, nose and throat) and a part time oncologist.11' The specialists are usually&#13;
hospital physicians who work part-time in the polyclinic.&#13;
6.     When hospitalization and/or further in-depth investigation is deemed necessary, the patient is&#13;
referred to a city hospital where the final decision is made on whether or not to admit the patient.&#13;
7.     The Russian primary care physician is not a specialized family practitioner, a concept which, for&#13;
most practical purposes, is absent in Russia. Practitioners in clinics usually begin to work in this setting&#13;
with limited knowledge and experience, and a priori, they must rely upon specialists.&#13;
8.     The diagnostic and therapeutic tools available to the primary physician for dealing with the above-&#13;
referenced health problems even in the main polyclinics observed, are: chest X-ray, manual complete&#13;
blood count, and manual urine analysis. These tests are rather inadequate, by familiar Western standards,&#13;
to manage even the common medical issues facing the population.&#13;
9.     The situation is compounded when the physician, who may well be fully aware of the diagnostic&#13;
options, lacks access to diagnostic facilities due to the virtual nonexistence of modern diagnostic support&#13;
system for primary care that might otherwise allow a primary care physician to keep the patient in the&#13;
community. As a result, many, if not all, "complicated" cases are not being diagnosed, let alone treated,&#13;
in the polyclinic setting. At best, patients in need of specialists and diagnostic services--even those that&#13;
could be provided in the community--are hospitalized. As intermediate level or first hospitals have&#13;
limited capacity (see discussion below), patients have access to limited, or even worse, ineffective care.&#13;
10.    It is emphasized, however, that this state of affairs was addressed to some degree by the former&#13;
USSR, and one can observe a different approach to care, at the oblast level. In the former USSR, there&#13;
were "Diagnostic Centers," one of which was located in Novosibirsk, that served as a strategic support&#13;
for polyclinics in rural areas. In the center of Novosibirsk, one may find sophisticated laboratory and&#13;
radiographic equipment, as well as highly skilled medical personnel; however, the city polyclinics have&#13;
no access to this facility.&#13;
11.    In summary, the problems faced by primary care medicine in Russia are as follows: (a) lack of&#13;
specialization of the primary care physician; (b) lack of diagnostic support (X-ray and laboratory work-&#13;
up); and (c) inadequate specialist support.  Consequently, apart from  the health consequences,&#13;
hospitalization burdens the system, resulting in the following: (i) at city hospitals, where there is limited&#13;
access to diagnostic support, a very long turn-around for the patient (about 15 days in Russia as opposed&#13;
to 4 to 6 days in the West) and an immediate need for more hospital beds; and (ii) limited access by the&#13;
patient to modern, qualified, and promptly delivered medicine.&#13;
' Considerable manpower and space is allocated to what is called in Russia "physiotherapy". This is a branch&#13;
of internal medicine rarely found the West. It includes various methods of treatment with physical agents&#13;
such as application of heat, radiation, water-bath, etc. These methods are not alternatives to other modalities&#13;
but are key medical treatment. It is beyond the scope of this report to evaluate scientifically the adequacy of&#13;
these treatments.&#13;

ANNEX 3.3                                                                                 123&#13;
Hospital Care - Selected Units&#13;
12.    Emergency Care and "Hospital Admission" In spite of the common nomenclature ("Priyomni&#13;
Pokoi"), a western-type emergency room was not observed in the hospitals visited, except for some&#13;
elements in the newest city hospital in Rostov. Selection and referral of patients are not done at point&#13;
of admission; rather, patients are sent to wards according to insufficiently supported diagnoses by primary&#13;
physicians (see discussion above). The lack of diagnostic and therapeutic equipment and support at point&#13;
of admission appears to be attributable to approach to care rather than to lack of resources.&#13;
13.    The emergency room is not designed or equipped to deal with emergency care. Patients are&#13;
transferred immediately, without a definite diagnosis (to be established in the emergency room), to an&#13;
"appropriate" ward. Alternatively, if the case warrants, staff are called in from departments such as&#13;
therapeutics, surgery, orthopedics, and anaesthesia. In any event, patients are not immediately treated&#13;
and stabilized in the emergency room.&#13;
14.    Even in major city and oblast-level hospitals, the units consist of 3 to 5 small rooms (2 x 3&#13;
meters) served by narrow doors, at times with leading stairs that impede movement of stretchers and&#13;
wheel chairs. In each room one can find a bed, a table, and a chair. The dimensions of the room and&#13;
lack of medical equipment, e.g., syringes and other disposables, I.V. lines, electrical supply lines, central&#13;
gas systems, preclude immediate action in the case of a medical emergency involving one or more&#13;
patients.&#13;
15.    The need for X-ray and/or imaging warrant, in most instances, the transportation of a patient&#13;
across a hospital which often lacks suitable passages. Laboratory examinations are hampered since the&#13;
laboratory is situated away from the so-called emergency room, and there is virtually no system for&#13;
effective transfer of patients or specimens.&#13;
16.   Intensive Care. The Russian "Reanimazia" unit is conceptually close to the western intensive&#13;
care unit, which supplies close monitoring and supervision of critical patients and, when necessary, life&#13;
support. The Russian unit in most instances lacks appropriate infrastructure and equipment. It is&#13;
generally a converted hospital room with no special modifications for its proper functioning, e.g., a&#13;
central monitoring station, appropriate spacing between beds, central gas and electrical systems, arterial&#13;
lines and central vein catheterization, and specialized modern equipment including respirators and&#13;
monitors. To the extent equipment can be found, it is outdated. For example, in all hospitals visited,&#13;
respirators are operated by electricity rather than pressurized air. A power failure in these institutions,&#13;
which for the most part have no back-up electrical supplies, endangers critical patients in need of&#13;
respirators.&#13;
17.    Operating Theaters. The operating theaters visited do not meet standards common in the west.&#13;
The rooms are small and lack basic prerequisites necessary for their proper functioning. They have no&#13;
gas system, no anti-static floor, no air-conditioning with under pressure to support containment of&#13;
infection. In some hospitals, even the use of anesthetic apparatus was not observed. In one case,&#13;
anesthesia was administered by ether. Proper monitors for operations are not available, nor is it possible&#13;
to take X-rays or conduct laboratory examination during operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
124                                                                                ANNEX 3.3&#13;
18.   Wards. In principle, wards in Russian hospitals serve the same purpose as do wards in the west,&#13;
with the exception that infectious conditions, such as streptococcal infection of the throat, are separated&#13;
either in the ward itself or are treated in a separate hospital. In the facilities visited, the ward provides&#13;
at best "hotel" services. Medically speaking, the general layout of the ward, usually along a narrow&#13;
corridor, does not have a nursing station that enables effective monitoring of patients. Beds in the room&#13;
are not maneuverable and do not allow for changing of position or height or even transportation of&#13;
patients. Movement of equipment into the room is hampered because of the number of beds and their&#13;
layout. Signalling devices and central gas systems are completely lacking. Hence, in case of need there&#13;
is almost no mechanism to alert staff, and even when staff arrive, the opportunity for prompt intervention&#13;
is virtually non-existent.&#13;
19.    Laboratory. The Western concept of a centralized laboratory does not exist in any of the&#13;
facilities observed, including oblast-level hospitals. In Rayon hospitals visited, labs usually consist of 2-3&#13;
small units with diagnostic functions limited to: manual determination of urine chemistry, namely acetone,&#13;
bilirubin, specific gravity, glucose; microscopic observation of urinary sediment; manual hematology,&#13;
namely complete blood count and differential; glucose analysis by the glucose oxidase method; manual,&#13;
namely spectrophotometric, analysis of other analytes, such as Total Protein, AST, ALT, Creatinine,&#13;
Calcium and Inorganic Phosphorus. Electrolytes are determined manually by chemical methods and not&#13;
by-flame photometry or by Ion Selective Electrodes.&#13;
20.    Critical "analytes" or tests are neither performed nor requested by physicians. Such tests include:&#13;
total CPK, Iron, Transferrin, Amylase, and Lipase. Acute and common problems in Russia, such as&#13;
myocardial infarction and alcoholism, cannot be supported by standard laboratory technology.&#13;
21.    With regard to quality, critical Prothrombin and Partial Thromboplastin (PT, PTT), essential for&#13;
operations, are performed manually with no integrated quality control, rendering these tests exceptionally&#13;
unreliable.&#13;
22.    Microbiology laboratories needed for isolation of bacteria and viruses and determination of&#13;
susceptibility to antibiotics are almost non-existent in the hospitals, due in part to the approach to care&#13;
of infectious disease in Russia, i.e., microbiology is part of a separate administration. This limits access&#13;
by medical facilities to relevant tests. For example, even in the Novosibirsk oblast hospital, where the&#13;
microbiology laboratory is on hospital grounds, its impact on patient care is negligible because the&#13;
laboratory, which belongs to the State Committee for Epidemiological and Sanitary Surveillance and&#13;
Control, is not accessible for regular care.1W'&#13;
23.    Furthermore, other cultures for significant bacteria, like mycobacteria (tuberculosis) or other&#13;
communicable diseases, are not performed in this laboratory but in a special laboratory for infectious&#13;
diseases, which is located elsewhere.&#13;
24.    The situation here described leads to prolonged turn-around time of laboratory requests. For&#13;
example, for routine biochemistry, critically needed for all patients, results are not available to physicians&#13;
for at least 24 hours, rendering some of the results ineffective, as in case of heart failure; different&#13;
equipment and organization could enable effective results in 4 hours. Moreover, emergency tests take&#13;
about 6 hours in the facilities visited, while the standard is about 40 minutes.&#13;
'2 On pertinent institutional issues, see Chemichovsky, et al, Chapters 3 and 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.3                                                                               125&#13;
25.   The low level of use of the laboratory appears to be attributable not to lack of knowledge (at least&#13;
in the hospitals), but to lack of equipment. In most instances, physicians were aware of the technological&#13;
options, but required appropriate training.&#13;
26.   X-ray and Imaging. Paralleling the lack of centralized laboratory facilities is the lack of&#13;
centralized imaging facilities, in the community and in Rayon and city hospitals. In most cases, X-ray&#13;
and imaging services are scattered across facilities by wards, floors, or sections.&#13;
27.    While layout issues mainly concern efficiency, the major issue is outdated equipment leading to&#13;
both reduced effectiveness of diagnosis and major safety concerns. For example, fluoroscopy (needed&#13;
for stomatological exams) is executed through direct viewing rather than through image intensifiers and&#13;
TV  monitors.  This endangers both patients and operators and reduces the effectiveness of the&#13;
examinations. In the case of pregnant women, for example, the levels of radiation observed by the team&#13;
(10-15R) would warrant an abortion by western standards.&#13;
28.    Equipment for catheterization and examination of blood vessels, needed mainly for examination&#13;
of cardiovascular and vascular problems in hospitals dealing with such problems, is non-existent.&#13;
Similarly, equipment for diagnosis of tuberculosis should enable images of real size and, beyond that,&#13;
permit correct diagnosis.  In the facilities visited, however, the largest image was of l10 x  l10&#13;
millimeters. Processing of films is manual rather than automated, thereby reducing the quality of the&#13;
images and compromising diagnostic capabilities.&#13;
29.   Mobile equipment could, in the absence of a stationary alternative, be used in a variety of&#13;
locations, space and passages permitting, such as in operating and emergency rooms. The existing&#13;
equipment is outdated and lacks the necessary power for proper functioning.&#13;
30.   In sum, non-centralized nature of laboratory and imaging services for diagnosis and treatment is&#13;
conceptually inefficient in view of cost and capacity of equipment and is deficient in quantity and quality.&#13;
This undoubtedly contributes significantly to the ineffectiveness of the Russian health care system and to&#13;
its inefficiency as marked by high levels of clinic utilization and hospitalization.&#13;
Practice in Selected Procedures&#13;
31.   This section aims to show the different modalities in medical care delivered mainly at the raion&#13;
hospitals, as well as to suggest the implied overall expenditures incurred due to the observed practices.&#13;
The medical problems which are presented in this section are related to the major causes of morbidity&#13;
and mortality in Russia.&#13;
32.   Acute Myocardial Infarction. Myocardial infarction may serve as the best example to show&#13;
differences in technology and modus operandi that influence morbidity and mortality rates as well as use&#13;
of service. When examined, myocardial infarction is divided into two phases: the acute phase, and the&#13;
complete recovery or chronic-disease phase. In the West, direct mortality during or immediately&#13;
foilowing myocardial infarction (which is the acute stage) was reduced by 15 to 20 percent following the&#13;
introduction of intensive care units. Further reduction of late onset mortality and morbidity (chronic&#13;
stage) was recently achieved by minimizing the extent of the heart muscle involved in the infarction&#13;
process, and during the recovery stages by preventing the onset of chronic heart failure (dilative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
126                                                                                ANNEX 3.3&#13;
cardiomyopathy). This was achieved by the (essential) administration of streptokinase or other drugs&#13;
within 6 hours or other drugs, and the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.&#13;
33.   In the areas visited by the mission, after a call is received that a person is suffering from acute&#13;
chest pain, in the city an ambulance will be called, while in the rural areas a physician will be summoned.&#13;
In both instances, an E.K.G will be performed and the patient will be transported to the hospital. In the&#13;
city the maximum time lag between symptoms reported and arrival to the hospital is about 4 hours while&#13;
in the rural areas one may find time intervals up to 24 hours. These time period are exceptionally long&#13;
especially if the mobile team does not have the right medication. The patient, most likely with&#13;
complications already, will be transported in both cases directly to a cardiology or internal medicine&#13;
department.&#13;
34.    However, this does not fully explain the norm of prolonged hospitalization since not all cases of&#13;
myocardial infarction end in complications. It is hypothesized that the problem is that the Russian&#13;
medicine observed by the mission, ignores western statistics that show that major complications from the&#13;
disease occur within a week of its onset, and that other complications are not prevented by hospitalization&#13;
beyond this period.&#13;
35.    Currently, at raion hospitals (and even at some oblast hospitals) follow the only procedures as&#13;
outlined (under "Russia") in Table 3.1, the '-' sign indicating 'no-performance' as compared with the&#13;
West, a standard the project aims to achieve.&#13;
36.    Trauma. In recent years the number of road accidents and other causes of trauma have increased;&#13;
it is now of the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in Russia. Depending on place of accident,&#13;
in Russia the patient is brought in the city to an Emergency Hospital or the Department of Surgery in&#13;
raion hospitals, rather than to an emergency room and an intensive care unit.&#13;
37.   The main issue here is a rather fundamental lack of critical diagnosis as implied in Table 3.2.&#13;
This leads to improper and often late treatment, and prolonged and unnecessary hospitalization.&#13;
38.   Infectious disease. Treatment of infectious diseases in Russia are in a way a peculiarity, namely&#13;
the medical system seems to over emphasize in practice as well as in regulatory decrees the conduct vis&#13;
a vis infections. By law, infections of any kind must be hospitalized no matter what the state of the&#13;
patient, and he or she must be isolated in special departments or even hospitals, contrary to any such&#13;
notion in the West. This leads to a dual hospitalization system, redundant to a large part by Western&#13;
norms.&#13;
39.    This notwithstanding, the number of infections acquired in hospitals in Russia is far larger than&#13;
in the West, 17% and 6%, respectively. Furthermore, no attempt has been made by the medical&#13;
establishment to switch to the use of sterile disposable equipment, or to encourage the extensive use of&#13;
the bacteriology laboratory to establish the exact identity of bacteria or their susceptibility to antibiotics.&#13;
40.    Physicians are almost always ignorant as to the bacteria present, and antibiotics are given&#13;
according to the patients' response and not the established susceptibility of the bacterium. Antibiotics&#13;
administered are usually inappropriate, the amount delivered is not monitored by the minimal inhibitory&#13;
concentration (MIC), nor are side effects prevented by establishing the therapeutic level of the drug&#13;
(antibiotic) in a particular patient.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.3                                                                                    127&#13;
41.    On-site epidemiology is prevented by the paucity of data generated by the physicians and lack of&#13;
computerized systems. Indeed, in an oblast hospital of 1,600 beds, only 10 blood cultures are drawn a&#13;
day, where it should be around 120.  Furthermore, antibiotics tested for susceptibility are not&#13;
standardized since they are prepared in-house; hence, sensitivity of bacteria is not always accurate and&#13;
reproducible.&#13;
42.    As for several critical examples, a patient with pneumonia by rule has to be hospitalized and&#13;
confined to the infectious disease area. However, this is not always the case, and there are instances&#13;
where patients are treated at home. The example reviewed here deals with an elderly patient who suffers&#13;
from a mild Chronic lung disease and is in respiratory distress, as in this case the patient would also be&#13;
hospitalized in the West so that comparisons can be drawn. As demonstrated in Table 3.3, here too some&#13;
critical test are not performed, and hospitalization is considerably longer in the "Russian case".&#13;
43.    Hepatitis is a major concern today in Russia. Although well recognized, few actions are taken&#13;
at the level of daily care to contain this infection. Time and again emphasis is directed to the isolation&#13;
of the patient and not to true prevention by detecting infected patients and eliminating contact with&#13;
infected blood products. To date, at least 5 different hepatitis viruses are known. There are methods&#13;
for easy detection and classification by type, that is hepatitis A, B and C (there is a variant of B which&#13;
is called "delta"). Isolation is rarely needed.&#13;
44.    In this example one has to recognize that the problem faced here is not only management and&#13;
follow up of patients during the acute illness but the major impact is on morbidity and mortality of&#13;
patients in years to come. Namely with hepatitis B and C, in a minority of cases they can become&#13;
chronic diseases with persistent infection and may transform into chronic liver disease and ultimately&#13;
cirrhosis and death.&#13;
45.    Hepatitis C is particularly problematic in this case. The disease is relatively new (the virus was&#13;
only isolated a decade ago) and extremely contagious through blood and blood products and many&#13;
cirrhosis patients (previously known as cryptogenic cirrhosis) are infected with it. Diagnosis is easily&#13;
performed, though as stated, is not performed at all in establishments visited, and the problem as a whole&#13;
is not tackled by the medical establishment.&#13;
46.    In the West, the only true remedy offered, before liver transplantation is warranted, is injections&#13;
of interferon. This treatment is extremely costly and at present is not suggested to be a standard&#13;
procedure in Russia. However, prevention and detection is most warranted, which by and large will&#13;
decrease the future expenditure, prolong life expectancy and increase well being.&#13;
47.    From these few rather incidental but most common examples, it is evident that the number of&#13;
hospital beds in Russia is not only a consequence of secondary gains, following budgetary practices,&#13;
but also of medical practice which no longer exists in the West. This practice is, in turn, partially due&#13;
to medical technology in its broader sense, namely the availability of new technologies which influence&#13;
the outcome of patients and the management of late onset morbidity. The project aims to promote&#13;
Western standards.&#13;

ANNEX 3.4&#13;
PROPOSED PILOT REFORMS IN HEALTH FINANCING1'&#13;
1.      During the course of project preparation, proposals have been put forward regarding new&#13;
financing mechanisms and reformed institutional responsibilities in health. These include:&#13;
(a)    a capitation mechanism for the allocation of medical funds to raions and insurers;&#13;
(b)    a link between health finance provided through the budget and the payroll tax earmarked&#13;
for health financing;&#13;
(c)    a mechanism to establish the financial obligation of federal authorities to the overall&#13;
oblast health budget;&#13;
(d)    reimbursement systems for providers;&#13;
(e)    an investment fund for health facilities.&#13;
2.     Under (d)--i.e., reimbursement systems for providers--Abt, Inc. (a consulting firm financed by&#13;
USAID) would provide training, information and cost-accounting systems. This would be a part of a&#13;
joint effort by the World Bank, Abt and the local authorities of Novosibirsk, to turn the Cherepanovo&#13;
raion, selected under the project for a model hospital, into a model raion of a comprehensive health care&#13;
reform.&#13;
3.     Under (e), a revolving development fund (DF) under the Territorial Compulsory Health Insurance&#13;
Fund (TCHIF) would finance investments in medical facilities. TCHIFs were created at an oblast level&#13;
by legislation, signed in April 1993, which amended and complemented the Health Insurance Law of&#13;
1991. The TCHIF is to receive the payroll tax of 3.4% and make payments to "insurers"--which may&#13;
be insurance companies or types of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)--or, in circumstances&#13;
where these have not yet come into existence, directly to health care providers through "branches" of the&#13;
TCHIF. In principle, the TCHIFs are supposed to receive comparable payments from oblast or raion&#13;
health budgets for individuals who are not employed, which would imply that the TCHIF would channel&#13;
all direct payments for health care. In many oblasts, this has not yet occurred, and oblast authorities&#13;
continue to finance hospitals and polyclinics in much the same way as under the Soviet system. The role&#13;
of the TCHIF with respect to capital expenditures in the health system has not yet been established. The&#13;
objective of the proposed pilot is to try out a possible modality in order that health investment should&#13;
respond more efficiently to demand. Health investments financed by the World Bank loan would be&#13;
administered by TCHIF as though they had been financed by the DF. This aspect of the financial reform&#13;
is elaborated upon here.&#13;
4.     The Russian 1993 health insurance legislation (HIL) assigns investments of different unspecified&#13;
kinds to federal, oblast and municipal budgets. Article 11 of the HIL assigns to the State and Municipal&#13;
System (i.e., budgets) the responsibility for upgrading medical facilities. Article 24 stipulates, however,&#13;
that the price of medical services should include (a) depreciation (to maintain equipment) and (b) 'profit",&#13;
a part of compensation for service that can be used for purchasing equipment. Thus, while there is&#13;
1' The financial aspects of the Russian health care system that are of concern to the project and its environment are&#13;
detailed in the paper, "Necessary Financial Mechanisms to Achieve Health System Reform Under the Russian Health&#13;
Insurance Legislation" by Dov Chernichovsky and Elena Potapchik. This paper has been the basis for discussion with&#13;
the regional health administrations and regional health insurance funds on the proposals put forward in this annex.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
131                                                                              ANNEX 3.4&#13;
recognition that some types of investments need to continue to be subsidized by the state, there is also&#13;
an explicit provision in the HIL that would allow providers to invest and maintain capital on their own,&#13;
and to receive compensation for this.&#13;
5.    In Russia, neither capital markets nor compensation systems for medical services are at present&#13;
developed enough to allow the financing of non-budgetary ("private") investments in medical facilities&#13;
in any meaningful way. Second, given their public nature and deteriorated financial state, medical&#13;
facilities have no access to whatever capital markets may be emerging. Third, there are also no&#13;
regulations governing such access; medical facilities working under public contracts need to be regulated&#13;
in this regard in order not to enter into "excessive" financial liabilities and "over-investment" that could&#13;
be detrimental to the system's financial liability. Fourth, budgetary revenues are in fact being substituted&#13;
or displaced by the revenues from the earmarked tax. There is, however, no link between these and&#13;
investment responsibilities, and the declining budget remains the main investment source. This inhibits&#13;
attempts to denationalize and privatize these facilities whenever warranted as a means to introduce&#13;
decentralized management competition and thereby to improve service.&#13;
6.     A possible solution to this problem  may be as follows. As the TCHIF is responsible for&#13;
compensation of routine capital costs of providers (depreciation and 'profits'), the TCHIF can also&#13;
become an investment facility, responsible for a revolving development or investment fund which would&#13;
operate alongside the budget, but with clearly delineated responsibilities between the two. In other&#13;
words,&#13;
(a)    a revolving Development Fund would be established under each TCHIF;&#13;
(b)    oblast and possibly federal administrations would retain the regulatory role concerning&#13;
the need for facilities or equipment beyond a particular size and cost;&#13;
(c)    oblast and possibly federal administrations would remain responsible for subsidizing&#13;
investment in facilities, to be agreed upon periodically;&#13;
(d)    a permanent development committee comprising of representatives of different levels&#13;
from government, the TCHIF, and providers would be established. For funds for this&#13;
Project, the Project Bureau or the CPIU would be represented.&#13;
7.     Once established, the Development Fund would operate in the following manner:&#13;
(a)    The committee would draw up (i) a list of investments by type and cost to be subsidized&#13;
entirely or in part by the federal and oblast budgets, (ii) a list requiring the committee's&#13;
approval ("certificate of need"), and (iii) a list not requiring any approval. These lists&#13;
would be updated periodically according to need and changing circumstances.&#13;
(b)    The approval of the Federal Ministry of Health and the Medical Industry (FMOH) might&#13;
be required for particular investments, depending on regulations which are to be&#13;
developed.&#13;
(c)    At least while private financial institutions are developing, all providers, including private&#13;
and other non-governmental free-standing entities, working under a public contract,&#13;
would be allowed to apply for loans from the Development Fund for investments not&#13;
requiring the committee's approval.&#13;
(d)    Development funds would be lent to medical providers on the basis of the agreed&#13;
investment program and (financially) approved loans for free-standing providers.&#13;
(e)    Providers would, in turn, repay the loans from the TCHIF revenues.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 34                                                                                132&#13;
(f)    According to regulations to be developed, the TCHIF may borrow from financial&#13;
institutions and/or budgetary resources.&#13;
8.    Part of TCHIF revenues, some of which have been accumulating due to lack of appropriate&#13;
allocation mechanisms, can be used to initiate the Development Fund. In any event, shortages in the&#13;
agreed investment budgets may be supplemented by borrowing from financial institutions using&#13;
government guarantees. Borrowing from international and foreign institutions such as the World Bank&#13;
should be made possible under this scheme.&#13;

9.     Specifically with regard to the project, in addition to the regular agreements or contracts, the&#13;
following agreements are to be reached:&#13;
(a)    Agreements between the oblast government and the TCHIF transferring the loan&#13;
earmarked for health (excluding funds for training) from the oblast government to the&#13;
TCHIF, and establishing the Fund's responsibilities in lieu of the loan, such as: (i)&#13;
on-lending to the medical beneficiary facilities per the Loan agreement, (ii) assuring that&#13;
the beneficiary facilities are reimbursed for capital costs at least in lieu of the Project,&#13;
(iii) collecting loan repayments from beneficiary facilities, and (iv) repaying the oblast&#13;
government;&#13;
(b)    Agreements between the oblast government--which remains responsible for training&#13;
(except for those aspects which concern the DF)--and the beneficiary facilities regarding&#13;
training of medical personnel.&#13;
(c)    Agreements between the TCHIF and the beneficiary facilities, with the involvement of&#13;
insurers, where applicable, establishing the procurement and disbursement procedures for&#13;
construction and equipment.&#13;
10.   Interaction with the Federal Health Insurance Fund, which was established for regional&#13;
equalization purposes, is not proposed under the project. However, interaction with this Fund should be&#13;
seriously considered in the future as a means to channel funds to areas in comparative need for medical&#13;
infrastructure and for establishing federal mechanisms to identify such areas. Such mechanisms were in&#13;
place during the Soviet era but have not been in use since 1988.&#13;
i1.    The statutes of the DF and its mode of operations are currently being developed with the&#13;
Novosibirsk authorities. Accordingly, under the project, the DF could develop capabilities to handle the&#13;
following functions:&#13;
(a)    procurement of moneys from different sources;&#13;
(b)    provision of training and technical assistance to medical facilities in the preparation of&#13;
development and business plans, and of tender documents;&#13;
(c)    lending moneys for the development of medical facilities on the basis of the agreed&#13;
investment programs;&#13;
(d)    supervising the appropriate use of loaned moneys, including the review of bidding&#13;
documents;&#13;
(e)    collection of repayment of loans;&#13;
(f)    assurance of fee schedules for medical care under public contracts that secure a fair&#13;
return on capital;&#13;
(g)    prudent financial management of all moneys available to the fund at any time.&#13;
12.    Apart from consulting services in developing these capabilities, the DF would be assisted by the&#13;
PB in the preparation of all project documents on behalf of the raions and facilities included in the&#13;
project. Given its nature, this assistance would provide guidance and training to the DF especially with&#13;
regard to points (a), (b), (d) and (g) listed above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.4                                                                              134&#13;
13.   Specifically, the project tender documents would be prepared by TCHIF with the assistance of&#13;
the Project Bureau/CPIU  and under the latter's supervision.  After their approval by the oblast&#13;
administration, the Project Bureau/CPIU would issue tender documents.&#13;
14.   A special committee would be established for the health component to review bidding documents.&#13;
This committee would include representatives of the oblast administration, the oblast health authority, the&#13;
TCHIF, and the Project Bureau/CPIU. This committee would select winning bids.&#13;
15.   The DF should be involved in all relevant (health) work of the Project Bureau/CPIU so that once&#13;
the CPIU is abolished, the DF can assume all relevant functions. The flow of funds and operations of&#13;
the DF in conjunction with the CPIU is depicted in Figure 1.&#13;
16.   It is proposed under the project that the World Bank loan would initiate, at least in Novosibirsk,&#13;
this Development Fund and that the loan would be administered through this Fund for at least some&#13;
subprojects. In other words, the TCHIF would substitute for the direct involvement of the raion health&#13;
authority and of medical facilities. Eventually, as part of its responsibility for processing the loan, the&#13;
TCHIF would be responsible for repayment of the loan from the revenues earned by medical facilities.&#13;

ANNEX 3.5&#13;
SELECTION CRITERIA AND MODEL APPRAISAL&#13;
FOR WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SUBPROJECTS&#13;
A. RATIONALE FOR SUBPROJECT ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA-'&#13;
1.     Subproject Capital Cost. The estimated capital cost of subprojects should be in the range&#13;
$100,000 to $2.0 million.&#13;
Rationale. To ensure that the subproject is not so small that it could be financed directly by the&#13;
oblast from its capital budget nor that the subproject is too large and would require a&#13;
disproportionate amount of the total capital fund available for the water/sanitation component.&#13;
2.     Affordability. The appraisal for each subproject is to include a financing plan giving details of:&#13;
(a)    the estimated annual cost of loan repayment;&#13;
(b)    the estimated annual cost of operation and maintenance of the proposed installation; and&#13;
(c)    the source of revenue income to meet the loan repayment costs and the future operating&#13;
and maintenance costs.&#13;
Rationale. To focus the attention of the oblast and the municipal (raion) authorities, at the&#13;
subproject appraisal stage, on the future expenditure and budgeting implications arising from the&#13;
implementation of subprojects and to direct the authorities towards initiating a program for&#13;
improvement in cost recovery.&#13;
3.     Sustainability. The appraisal for each subproject is to set out the proposals for effective future&#13;
operation and maintenance of the installations to be provided.&#13;
Rationale. To ensure, at the appraisal stage, that the oblast and municipal (raion) authorities&#13;
recognize the need for skilled operation and maintenance manpower and there is provision for&#13;
appropriate training and for obtaining consumable items, spare parts, etc., to ensure that the&#13;
efficient operation of the installation is sustained over its planned life span.&#13;
' It can be observed that these criteria, together with the information in the model appraisal, do not provide&#13;
very sharp procedures for choosing priorities among subprojects, all of which can be easily justified in terms&#13;
of appraisal methods nornally employed in World Bank projects. Since there are practical limits to how fast&#13;
these subprojects can be undertaken, it is desirable to have other tools for ranking priorities. A U.K. water&#13;
company, for example, employs a ranking procedure based on the numbers and types of consumers affected,&#13;
the age, condition and capacity of the existing installation and the number and seriousness of past failures of&#13;
the installation. During the preparation phase, the use of such rankings, adjusted to local conditions, and the&#13;
process of developing them, are being discussed with Russian counterparts. The weighting given to each&#13;
consideration is, to some degree, arbitrary--or rather, is determined as much by political as technological&#13;
factors--and, as such, must be a decision of the oblast administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
136                                                                                ANNEX 3.5&#13;
4.     Institutional arrangements.  The subproject appraisal is required to substantiate that the&#13;
institutional organization of the water/sanitation utility will be competent to manage and operate the&#13;
proposed installation.&#13;
Rationale. To direct the oblast and municipal (raion) authorities towards undertaking the&#13;
necessary institutional reforms in the provision of water and wastewater services to provide for&#13;
future long-term efficiency in the delivery of service provision.&#13;
5.     Subproject loan beneficiary. In some municipalities (raions) some of the existing assets of the&#13;
water or wastewater infrastructure (i.e. pipelines, water sources, treatment plants, etc.) are in the&#13;
ownership of the major industrial enterprises in the municipality. In most, negotiations are being&#13;
completed for transfer of the assets of the existing infrastructure from the industrial enterprises to the&#13;
municipality. The subproject appraisal is required to confirm that the water or wastewater utility assets&#13;
which are to be rehabilitated or improved will be in the beneficial ownership of the municipality or&#13;
vodokanal.&#13;
Rationale. To ensure that subproject loan finance is only provided for the rehabilitation of oblast&#13;
or municipal infrastructure and is not directed to the assets of the industrial enterprises that may&#13;
in future be privatized.&#13;
6.     Environmental assessment. Subproject appraisals are to include an environmental analysis&#13;
prepared in accordance with World Bank Operational Directive No. 4.01 and Russian Federal guidelines,&#13;
and the analysis is to be approved by the Project Bureau and by the Regional Committee for&#13;
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources.&#13;
Rationale. To ensure that the impact of the subproject on the environment is taken into account&#13;
at its conception stage and that appropriate measures are taken to mitigate any adverse&#13;
environmental impacts.&#13;
7.     Subproject program.  An implementation program  is to be included with each subproject&#13;
appraisal. The program is to set out the periods allowed for design, contract procurement, construction,&#13;
and commissioning. Subprojects will be expected to be complete and operational within two years from&#13;
the commencement of detail design.&#13;
Rationale. To direct the oblast and municipal (raion) authorities towards ensuring that in the&#13;
implementation of subprojects, the disbursement of capital is undertaken in accordance with a&#13;
planned procedure and to provide for efficiency in the implementation and completion of&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
8.     Strategic planning. Subproject proposals in the oblasts and municipalities are to form part of&#13;
the long-term strategy for the development of water and wastewater services, and the appraisal of each&#13;
subproject is to show how this is to be achieved.&#13;
Rationale. To ensure that refurbishment and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure carried out&#13;
under the subprojects will be sustainable as part of the long-term development strategy for the&#13;
water and wastewater services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 3.5                                                                                       137&#13;
9.     Technical appraisal. Each proposed subproject will be required to have a technical appraisal&#13;
which is to include an evaluation of options and an economic appraisal based on a cost-benefit analysis.&#13;
Rationale. To ensure, at the planning stage, that all feasible options are carefully considered on&#13;
technical and economic merits before the subproject is included in the program for&#13;
implementation.&#13;

C. MODEL SUBPROJECT APPRAISAL&#13;
DONETSK - RENOVATION OF EMSTING SEWAGE TREATMENT FACILITIES&#13;
1.     Subproject: Renovation of Donetsk sewage treatment works!'.&#13;
2.     Beneficiary Population: 56000&#13;
Description of Existing Situation&#13;
3.     The mining town of Donetsk, population 56,000, has a gravity wastewater collection system and&#13;
a sewage treatment works, sized for a flow of 18,000 m3/d. The system is operated by the vodokanal.&#13;
In general, only domestic sewage is treated at the works.&#13;
2/ The information used in the appraisal was obtained during a single site visit on the November 29, 1994.&#13;
(Normally greater detail would be available.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
140                                                                                ANNEX 3.5&#13;
4.     Some of the sewers in the town are undersized and this prevents new areas, e.g., the miners'&#13;
living estate being connected to the system.&#13;
5.     Areas not served by the system are connected to cesspits, the contents of which are disposed of&#13;
at the sewage treatment works.&#13;
6.     All flows arriving at the central sewage treatment works are pumped up into the inlet. The works&#13;
provides preliminary, primary, secondary and tertiary treatment. Treatment units include coarse screens,&#13;
grit chambers, four settlement tanks, three aerated percolating filters, five humus tanks and an aerated&#13;
lagoon. Sludge is disposed of to six drying beds, used in rotation. The final use of the sludge was not&#13;
identified.&#13;
7.     At the time of the site visit only two of the three screens, three of the primary tanks, one of the&#13;
filters and four of the humus tanks were operable. In addition, the floating aerators in the tertiary lagoon&#13;
did not function.&#13;
8.     The works BOD consent was given as 10 mg/l (average), but presently can only achieve 20 mg/I.&#13;
9.     In addition to the central treatment facility, there is also a small undersized treatment works, sized&#13;
for 700 m3/d, which serves an outlying area. The works, which was not visited, was stated to be in poor&#13;
condition. The actual treatment capacity needed is 1200 m3/d.&#13;
Identification of Need&#13;
10.    There is a need to renovate the existing treatment units at the sewage treatment works to provide,&#13;
in effect, additional treatment capacity. This would either:&#13;
(a)    allow the existing flows arriving at the works to be treated to a higher standard, as&#13;
required by the discharge consent, or&#13;
(b)    allow additional flows to be passed to the treatment works while maintaining the present&#13;
performance level.&#13;
11.    The second approach would allow some unsewered areas to be connected to the system or would&#13;
allow the outlying area treatment works to be abandoned and the flow transferred to the central works.&#13;
Relaxation of the existing discharge consent would be a prerequisite.&#13;
12.    For the purpose of this report, objective (a) will be assumed as the basis for the project.&#13;
Options Considered&#13;
13.   The treatment units in need of urgent renovation include:&#13;
(a)    inlet screens (replacement of one screen),&#13;
(b)    renovation of one primary settlement tank, and&#13;
(c)    renovation of percolating aerated filters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.5                                                                               141&#13;
14.   Work would form the first phase of long-term project to increase the capacity of the treatment&#13;
capability by 9000 m3/d, to 27,000 m3/d.&#13;
15.   Renovation would permit the performance of the existing facilities to be optimized before work&#13;
can proceed on the design and construction of any new capital works. The approach would allow the&#13;
capacity of any extensions to be sized correctly and their construction costs to be minimized.&#13;
16.    No other technically appropriate options have been identified, other than not undertake a project.&#13;
Selection of Preferred Solution&#13;
17.   The preferred scheme will involve the renovation of existing sewage treatment facilities, to serve&#13;
as a self-contained first phase in increasing the treatment capacity at the works. The aim of the subproject&#13;
is to achieve compliance with the legal discharge standard and to improve the receiving water quality.&#13;
I. Environmental Analysis of Preferred Scheme&#13;
Baseline Situation&#13;
18.   The town, which has a population of 56,000, is partly served by a sewerage system. Wastewater&#13;
discharges by gravity to a central treatment plant which has a capacity of 18,000 cu.m. per day. The&#13;
sewerage system and the treatment plant, which are operated by the vodokanal, generally treat only&#13;
domestic wastewater. Industrial wastewater flow is of no significance.&#13;
19.   Some of the existing sewers are overloaded and, in consequence, new areas of housing cannot&#13;
be connected to the system. Those properties in areas that are not served by sewers have cesspits and the&#13;
municipality provides an emptying service to take cesspit contents by road tanker to the wastewater&#13;
treatment plant.&#13;
20.   The central wastewater treatment plant provides mechanical and biological treatment by aerated&#13;
percolating filters. Sludge is air dried on drying beds. At present many of the treatment units are not&#13;
able to be used. For example, one of the screens, one of the primary settlement tanks and one of the&#13;
humus tanks, are not in operating condition. In addition, the floating aerators in the tertiary lagoon&#13;
cannot be used due to mechanical failure&#13;
21.    Another small wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 700 cu.m. per day serves an outlying&#13;
area. This works is in poor structural condition and is also overloaded. The capacity required to provide&#13;
an acceptable level of treatment is 1,200 cu.m. per day.&#13;
Regulatory and Institutional Considerations&#13;
22.   The treatment works presently fail to comply with its consent of 10 mg/I BOD and as a&#13;
consequence, the vodokanal is liable to be fined for non-compliance. One of the contributing causes is&#13;
undoubtedly the loss of capacity because treatment units are out of service and are in need of renovation.&#13;
Failure to meet with the discharge consent means that up to two times the acceptable pollution load is&#13;
entering the receiving waters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
142                                                                                      ANNEX 3.5&#13;
23.    The lack of treatment capacity at the works also prevents unsewered areas being connected to the&#13;
central sewerage system.&#13;
Environmental Impact of Proposals&#13;
24.    The renovation of the existing treatment facilities will enable the efficiency of the works to be&#13;
improved, allowing the works to treat the existing flow to a higher standard. The environmental benefits&#13;
of the project would be:&#13;
(a)    anticipated compliance with the discharge consent;&#13;
(b)    reduced pollution to the receiving waters linked to improved water quality;&#13;
(c)    avoidance of penalties for non-compliance, allowing the monies saved to be spent on&#13;
more worthwhile activities, e.g. enhanced maintenance works; and&#13;
(d)    reduced production of secondary humus sludge.&#13;
25.    No negative impacts are envisaged.&#13;
Mitigation and Enhancement Measures&#13;
26.    The impact directly associated with the renovation of existing facilities which take place on the&#13;
sewage treatment works site should not cause any environmental problems and no mitigation measures&#13;
are considered necessary.&#13;
27.    A relaxation of the consent could be pursued in anticipation of the improvements.&#13;
Capital and Operating Costs&#13;
28.    The estimated capital costs of the scheme are tabulated below:&#13;
IMPROVEMENT                                COST US$&#13;
.........................................................................................................................................&#13;
One replacement screen                          50,000&#13;
Renovation of one primary                       70,000&#13;
settlement tank&#13;
Renovation of two aerated                      175,000&#13;
percolating filters&#13;
Other miscellaneous improvements                50,000&#13;
.........................................................................................................................................&#13;
TOTAL                                          345,000&#13;
29.    An approximate amount of US$40,000 (12% of the capital cost) is to be assigned for design and&#13;
supervision. It is assumed that the capital and design work would be carried out in Year One, and the&#13;
plant would be operational by Year 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.5                                                                                       143&#13;
30.    As the project is based upon reintroducing existing facilities, the increase in operating cost would&#13;
be expected to be low, although adequate provision for maintenance should be allowed for. An increase&#13;
of US$15,000 per year for increased electricity and maintenance, over existing costs, should be included&#13;
in the operations budget.&#13;
Present Value Analysis&#13;
31.    Present values of the flows of costs are provided for the following two cases:&#13;
(a)    "Do-Nothing" (without a project), and&#13;
(b)    Renovation of the sewage treatment works.&#13;
32.    They are based over a 20-year period and assume a discount rate of 15%.&#13;
SCHEME                                             PRESENT VALUE US$&#13;
...................................................................................................................................................................................................&#13;
Do-Nothing (without a project)                             477,000&#13;
Renovation of the sewage treatment works                   404,000&#13;
33.    The analysis for the "Do-Nothing" option assumes that there will be a 5%  yearly increase in&#13;
additional operational and maintenance costs, and in penalties for non-compliance for twenty years, at&#13;
which time the rehabilitation would be carried out at a cost of $345,000.&#13;
34.     The additional cost per person of doing nothing over twenty years would be in the order of&#13;
US$7.20.&#13;
35.    The benefits that would arise from the project if implemented would be:&#13;
(a)    improved water quality in the receiving waters;&#13;
(b)    improvement in the efficiency of all treatment stages;&#13;
(c)    the improvement in the quality of the Donetsk sewage discharged to the receiving waters,&#13;
sufficient to comply with the final effluent quality standards and to avoid the payment of&#13;
penalties;&#13;
(d)    reduction in the volume of secondary humus sludge produced;&#13;
(e)    potential for the sizing of any future extensions to be reduced from existing proposals;&#13;
and&#13;
(f)    savings on penalties for non-compliance with the discharge standard .&#13;
Program for Implementation&#13;
36.    A provisional program for implementation is given below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
144                                                                                  ANNEX 3.5&#13;
ACTIVITY                                  PERIOD&#13;
.................................................................................................................................................................&#13;
Design                                    2 months&#13;
Contract Preparation and Tender           3 months&#13;
Installation                              6 months&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
37.    The project is aimed at improving the performance of existing treatment facilities already operated&#13;
by the vodokanal and, as such, should be readily sustainable. 7he Municipality will however be required&#13;
to demonstrate that adequate allowance for the maintenance of the equipment is made in future budget&#13;
provisions. 7he provision of adequate spare parts, or easy access to them in Russia, will be required.&#13;
38.    Some training in maintenance techniques for the new equipment will be needed.&#13;
H. Institutional and Economic Appraisal&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
39.    Implementation of the project would be undertaken as an improvement to the treatment facilities&#13;
already operated at the sewage treatment works. Based on observations and meetings during the site visit,&#13;
it is considered that the vodokanal has in place the necessary arrangements for management,&#13;
administration and operation of the facilities. Some additional training in budgetary control and&#13;
maintenance planning would however be advised.&#13;
Loan Beneficiary&#13;
40.    It is understood that the sewerage assets are owned by the Municipality. Confirmation in writing&#13;
will be required.&#13;
Affordability&#13;
41.    The annual cost of loan repayment based upon the estimated capital cost of the subproject and&#13;
calculated on an interest rate of 7.5 % and a repayment period of 17 years with a five-year grace period,&#13;
is in the order of US$53,000.&#13;
42.    The source of revenue income for meeting the annual costs is understood to be the Oblast&#13;
Authority. Confirmation will be required.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 3.6&#13;
BUDGET AND EXPENDITtURE MANAGEMENT COMPONENT:&#13;
Consultant Terms of Reference and Hardware Specirications&#13;
Public Finance Management Consulting Services&#13;
1.    The consulting services, as suggested here, is based on discussions with the public officials of&#13;
the oblast of Novosibirsk.&#13;
2.    The consulting services will be categorized as follows:&#13;
-     Budget management methods&#13;
-      Expenditure programming&#13;
-      Public finance training (overseas or in-country)&#13;
-      Long-term borrowing options and debt management&#13;
3.    The assistance can be provided simultaneously using one expatriate consultant and four local&#13;
consultants over a one-year period. Specialized expertise can be coordinated using the Bank staff or&#13;
USAID assistance for Public Finance Training, underwriting issues related to long-term borrowing, etc.&#13;
Automated Budget Management System                                                     v&#13;
4.    The oblast of Novosibirsk has specifically requested a review of the budget management system&#13;
and recommendations for its improvement. One major purpose of the assignment will be to develop a&#13;
computerized Model Budgeting System between the oblast and raion government. This should facilitate&#13;
broader reforms of oblast fiscal and social expenditure policies.&#13;
5.    Intra-oblast fiscal relationships are currently a function of negotiated budgeting. The raion and&#13;
oblast officials negotiate the budgets, primarily due to the manner in which the budgets are presented.&#13;
The existing format does not lend itself to be a "stand-alone" transparent document. Sufficient detail is&#13;
not requested, neither is it feasible to prepare the detail manually, without errors. This creates the&#13;
appearance of many gray areas in the budget which are not clearly justified and are, therefore, subject&#13;
to arbitrary cuts by the oblast.&#13;
6.    On the other hand, the raions spend money allocated for targeted programs by reallocating funds&#13;
without requesting approval from the oblast on a timely basis. The timeliness of requesting approvals&#13;
can be greatly reduced by an automated process.&#13;
7.    Other reforms are needed in expenditure policies themselves. These require an analysis of options&#13;
for reducing--preferably eliminating--subsidies of all types, and placing greater reliance on user charges&#13;
and/or privatization of service provision, etc. For expenditures that remain a budgetary responsibility,&#13;
there need to be clear rules as to which level of government carries responsibility. Budget decisions&#13;
should greatly reduce and preferably eliminate the use of traditional expenditure norms, and should find&#13;
other ways to ensure that the implications of investment for future recurrent expenditures are considered&#13;
before investments are approved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
147                                                                              ANNEX 3.6&#13;
8.    On the revenue side, it is necessary to analyze and present options for ways to increase local&#13;
revenues, for example, land taxation, property taxes.  More transparent transfer mechanisms to&#13;
redistribute revenues to poorer raions, which would also provide a greater incentive to better budgetary&#13;
management at the raion level, need to be developed. Mechanisms are required to protect the poorest&#13;
raions against a collapse of services if revenues collapse. An appropriate borrowing policy needs to be&#13;
established.&#13;
9.    It is recommended that the Project Bureau hire four local staff who are experienced in public&#13;
finance and information systems practices. The terms of reference for these individuals will be provided.&#13;
It is also recommended that an expatriate consultant experienced in municipal management and public&#13;
finance management be assigned to provide guidance for this effort.&#13;
10.   Budget Preparation:&#13;
-      Revenue database by source of revenues to be developed for revenue forecasting&#13;
-      Expenditure classifications&#13;
-      Consolidation of extra-budget funds into the general budget&#13;
-      Preparation of a consolidated budget with clearly segregated "fund" budgets, such as&#13;
general, special revenue, capital, enterprise, etc.&#13;
-      Budget prepared by the sources and uses method by classifying the various "Funds" in&#13;
order to clearly depict the inter-governmental transfers&#13;
-      Legislated budget preparation time-table and relations with State Council (Duma)&#13;
-      Capital budget preparation, setting priorities, cost estimating, cost-benefit analysis&#13;
(impact analysis)&#13;
-      Multi-year capital planning (very important in the context of the project since the&#13;
project is a multi-year project)&#13;
11.   Budget Management &amp; Reporting:&#13;
-      Review expenditure management, spending approval process in the raions, cities and oblast&#13;
-      Approval process for transfers of allocations from budget to budget or line-item to line-item&#13;
-      Revenue collection, administration function, (tax bills, receivable aging, delinquents&#13;
collection function, etc.)&#13;

E. MONITORING&#13;
I.     Local Consultants in Novosibirsk and Rostov Oblasts (2)&#13;
1 .    Objective: To assist the Project Bureaus in the two oblasts in the day-to-day monitoring of the&#13;
project.&#13;
2.     Duranon: 6 months in FY96 and FY2003 and full time between 1997-2002.&#13;
3.     Outcome: An adequately monitored project whose findings would feed into the evaluation of the&#13;
project and enhance its effective replication.&#13;
II.    Evaluation: Terms of Reference for Local Consultants&#13;
4.     Consultants/research institutions for data collection in Rostov and Novosibirsk oblasts on the&#13;
stakeholders including the borrower, beneficiaries of the project such as users of education and&#13;
health services, and others with vested interests such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs),&#13;
private sector firms, etc.&#13;
5.     Objective: To gather information about stakeholders in order to evaluate the impact of the&#13;
project. Questions asked would include: Who are the stakeholders? What social and cultural&#13;
factors affect their ability to participate in the operations? Are project objectives consistent with&#13;
their needs, interests and capacities? What is the impact of the project on team? Were they&#13;
consulted on the project? The above data will give a baseline picture of the nature and type of&#13;
stakeholders and issues to be overcome by the project. The data could be collected through a mix&#13;
of methodological tools:  sample surveys, participatory field work, and workshops.  The&#13;
consultants would also conduct comprehensive surveys of the stakeholders to assess the validity&#13;
of the objectives of the project, the expectations of the stakeholders with regard to the project,&#13;
and how far the project has achieved the objectives and met the expectations. Through this&#13;
exercise, several alternative ways of designing Phase II of the project could be discovered.&#13;
There are essentially two types of stakeholders in the project: policymakers and implementors&#13;
such as the mayor, deputy governors, financial officers in the oblast, raion and city governments;&#13;
and project specific stakeholders such as government officials in charge of health, education and&#13;
water supply, and stakeholders in specific subprojects.&#13;
The stakeholders in the first category would be asked questions such as: How were decisions for&#13;
subprojects made? Is there evidence that the sectoral mix of subprojects was very different from&#13;
what might have prevailed if there had been no constraints? Is there evidence that similar&#13;
projects in the future should offer a wider menu to communities?  Are there any continuing&#13;
constraints to wider community participation in project design? Is there an inherent bias in&#13;
selection procedures towards urban areas? What was their evaluation of the preparation period&#13;
(too long/short, use of grants and portfolio loan, involvement of administration) and financial&#13;
management?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING PROGRAM&#13;
I.    The project environmental institutional strengthening program will be closely coordinated with&#13;
both the Black Sea Environmental Program (BSEP) and the forthcoming Water Sector Project. The&#13;
objective of the identified program is to support the project process of subprojects screening, evaluation,&#13;
selection, implementation, and management by strengthening institutional capacities in subprojects&#13;
environment-related activities.  This will be achieved primarily through technical training and&#13;
complementary studies. The following activities are limited to those which will be undertaken during&#13;
project implementation only and hence, do not include those which were launched during project&#13;
preparation. Some of the training activities took place during project preparation partially financed by&#13;
the Black Sea Environmental Program (BSEP). Support from this source is expected to continue and&#13;
grant financing is being sought.&#13;

            Infrastructure Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The principal goals of the Community
            Social Infrastructure Project are to: 1) reduce the present
            deterioration of social infrastructure by financing the
            rehabilitation and limited replacement of high priority
            facilities for providing health care, education, water
            supply and sanitation; 2) improve the efficiency of managing
            public resources; 3) promote private sector development; 4)
            contribute to the government's policy of
            decentralization by promoting broad participation in project
            decision-making; and 5) monitor the effectiveness of new
            practices, and disseminate the results, to promote their use
            in similar activities elsewhere in the Russian Federation.
            The project consists of: 1) an education component which
            includes school rehabilitations, school extensions,
            construction of new schools, computers, laboratory
            equipment, furniture and a management information system
            program; 2) a health component consisting of the
            rehabilitation and upgrading of selected city and raion
            hospitals; 3) a water supply and sanitation component
            including the rehabilitation, refurbishment and renewal of
            the existing infrastructure in order to improve drinking
            water disinfection, water distribution, wastewater
            treatment, and sewerage; 4) a budget and expenditure
            management component which will consist of consulting
            services in local revenues, budget formulation, expenditure
            management/budgetary control, and social expenditure policy;
            and 5) a monitoring and evaluation component.
