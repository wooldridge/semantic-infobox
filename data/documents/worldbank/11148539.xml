Foreword&#13;
T   he present report provides a synthesis of the self-assessment and benchmarking&#13;
    exercise carried out among about 4 African utilities engaged in water supply and&#13;
sanitation services. These assessments and the ensuing regional workshops are critical&#13;
steps in the operationalization of the Water Operators Partnerships program for Africa&#13;
(WOP-Africa). WOP-Africa is built on the premise that well-performing utilities will step&#13;
forward and emerge as leaders and that the needs of the less well-performing utilities will&#13;
be met in a professional and sustainable manner.&#13;
&#13;
WOP-Africa is the regional branch of the Global WOP Alliance, a central tenet of the&#13;
Hashimoto Action Plan launched at the Mexico World Water Forum (2005) and endorsed&#13;
by the United Nations Secretary-General's Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation&#13;
(UNSGAB). The basic strategy of WOP is to seek accelerated improvements through&#13;
more intense and systematic knowledge sharing including support partnerships between&#13;
operators.&#13;
&#13;
The initial step to promote and develop the WOP-Africa initiative was the Nairobi&#13;
(December 2006) workshop which endorsed the idea and mandated UN Habitat and&#13;
the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) to pursue its preparation. The next step was&#13;
the Johannesburg Workshop (April 2007) which brought together about 00 water utility&#13;
executives representing 70 water utilities in 0 African countries. The Johannesburg&#13;
WorkshopdefinedtheprinciplesandgovernancestructurefortheWOP-Africaprogram&#13;
and outlined the action plan for its operationalization including the continent-wide&#13;
benchmarking exercise which is the object of this report.&#13;
&#13;
The present synthesis report confirms that there are African utilities whose operating&#13;
standards put them among the top 25 percent world-wide. It also shows that a large&#13;
number of utilities have considerable room for improvement. Consequently, there is&#13;
high potential for WOPs and progress through peer support and networking as utilities&#13;
themselves are best placed to show how to move up the performance ladder.&#13;

making opportunities. Although efforts have been made to verify the data with utilities,&#13;
there are still cases of extreme outliers which are difficult to explain. Since the main&#13;
audience of this report is utilities, the position taken by the authors has been to report&#13;
these as indicated by the respective utilities rather than eliminate dubious data, which&#13;
would have required the arbitrary determination of acceptable maximums and minimums.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     5&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    This position is consistent with the principle of self-assessment; the regional workshops&#13;
    have made many utilities keenly aware of the gaps and weaknesses of their management&#13;
    information systems.&#13;
&#13;
    We believe that by working together and sharing the immense utility experience that exists&#13;
    on the continent, WOP-Africa is more likely to realize its vision of an Africa with improved&#13;

    Executive Summary&#13;
    U    rban water utilities in Africa differ greatly in terms of size, organisational culture and&#13;
         operating environments. But they all share one major challenge, that is, expanding&#13;
    access to appropriate levels of services to their growing urban populations. This challenge&#13;
    can be seen clearly in the context of the MDGs where Africa lags far behind other regions.&#13;
    ItisnowwidelyacknowledgedthattheinefficienciesofAfricanwaterutilitiesareamajor&#13;
    cause of poor access to water services. In many systems, as much as a third of production&#13;
    is lost through physical and commercial losses and revenues are insufficient to cover&#13;
    operating costs let alone expand service coverage. Thus, it is becoming clear that the real&#13;
    potentialintheAfricanwatersectorliesinincreasingefficiencyintheexistingsystems-for&#13;
    examplebyreducingwastage,improvingservicequalityandsecuringcashflows.&#13;
&#13;
    Water operator's partnerships (WOPs) have been proposed by utilities and their partners as a&#13;
    promisingapproachforimprovingtheefficiencyofwaterutilitiesandacceleratingprogress&#13;
    towards the MDG targets for water and sanitation. At the heart of these partnerships is a&#13;
    strategy of intense and systematic knowledge-sharing (including peer-support) between&#13;
    water operators as a way of bridging the capacity gaps that exist in many countries.&#13;
    However, limited availability of reliable performance information across the region presents&#13;
    asignificantchallengetoperformanceimprovementthroughpartnershipsasitisdifficultto&#13;
    tell which operators are doing well and should be emulated and which ones need support&#13;
    from peers. To support the partnering approach, the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)&#13;
    in Africa facilitated a utility self-assessment exercise among selected African water utilities&#13;
    to ascertain their strengths and needs and identify the most promising areas for learning&#13;
    and peer-support under the evolving WOP platform. This report synthesizes the results&#13;
    of the assessment and provides a basis for further development of the WOP program in&#13;
    Africa.&#13;
&#13;
    Thefindings,despitethemanyproblemsingettingreliabledata,broadlyconfirmtheperilous&#13;
    state of the urban water sector in Africa. On average, utilities provide water to only about&#13;
    65 percent of the population within their respective areas of jurisdiction while sewerage&#13;
    services coverage is only 6 percent. Sewerage coverage generally lags behind water in&#13;
    all regions but it is one of the areas where there is greatest opportunity for collaboration.&#13;
    The findings also show that Non-Revenue Water (NRW) is a major weakness for most&#13;
    utilities in the sample. In many systems, as much as a third of production is lost due to&#13;
    technical and commercial losses and, on average, utilities in the sample get revenue for&#13;
    only half of the water they produce.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the NRW challenge, most utilities in the sample are currently struggling&#13;
to cover even their operating costs. In all regions less than half of the utilities can be&#13;
consideredfinanciallyviableand,formany,poorperformanceoncollectionsseemstobe&#13;
the main problem.&#13;
&#13;
Given the renewed focus on achieving the MDG targets for water and sanitation access&#13;
on the continent, the evolving WOP-Africa program is well placed to connect utilities and&#13;
facilitate knowledge sharing and capacity building - especially on improving technical&#13;
efficiencyandimprovingcashflows,areasthatarecriticaltoimprovingservicecoverage.             &#13;
Contrary to the view held by many sector observers, Africa is not entirely short of well-&#13;
performing utilities. Many countries have improved the institutional framework making it&#13;
possible for utilities to shift from crisis management to strategic planning and performance&#13;
improvement, which can be emulated by those still lagging behind. However, improvement&#13;
by emulation requires that utilities are found which, firstly, exhibit superior performance&#13;
and, secondly, have objectives or specific strengths which match the weaknesses of&#13;
those utilities seeking improvement. This assessment provides some indication of who the&#13;
superiorperformersmightbe,butclearlymoreworkisneededtoconfirmtheirsuperiority&#13;
and ability to provide peer-support.&#13;

    Introduction&#13;
    C     lean drinking water shortages&#13;
          continue to be a significant problem&#13;
    in many parts of Africa. The quality and&#13;

                                                      peer support partnerships between public&#13;
    coverage of services from most of the             operators. To support this process, WSP-&#13;
    urban water utilities remains poor. The           Africa facilitated a utility self-assessment&#13;
    situation is becoming worse with high urban       exercise among selected African water&#13;
    population growth rates reported at over          utilities to ascertain their strengths and&#13;
    2-6 percent per year. Keeping pace with           needs and identify the most promising&#13;
    the rapid pace of urban population growth         areas for learning and peer-support under&#13;
    is a key challenge for urban water utilities in   the evolving WOP platform. This report&#13;

 Utilities were grouped into geographical sub-regions (Eastern, Western and Southern). The reason for this was to&#13;
encourage utilities to look within their sub-region for a partner - and only look outside the sub-region if there are no&#13;
"good performers". This is because of the high cost implications of travel in Africa.&#13;

Also, for each quantitative indicator, we        data was available. The presentation&#13;
calculated the mean value which is usually       of results is organised according to the&#13;
helpful in gauging median performance.           themes and performance categories&#13;
However, since the assessment exercise           shown in Table 2.1. A number of graphs&#13;
did not utilise statistical sampling,            are presented with the top quartile (top 25&#13;
no inference can be made about the               percent) values marked for each indicator,&#13;

participating utilities can compare their        for NRW percent and staff productivity,&#13;

But as earlier suggested a better target for     indicate good performance). In addition,&#13;
improving performance would be to move           while the top quartile values for most&#13;
up within the top quartile of the group. We      indicators represent the suggested cut-&#13;
also compared the mean values with those         off point for identifying strong and weak&#13;
from other regions in order to determine         performance, this cut-off point may not be&#13;
how this sample of African utilities is faring   appropriate for all indicators. For example,&#13;
in comparison to other utilities elsewhere       the top quartile may not be a relevant&#13;
in the world. Here, we made use of the IB-       target for per capita consumption - as very&#13;
NET data performance dataset to compute          high values may indicate wasteful use of&#13;
the average values of key indicators for         water while very low values may point to&#13;
utilities from East and Central Asia (ECA),      insufficient availability of water for basic&#13;

     manpower through manpower reduction               availability, water quality, water pressure,&#13;

     on key performance parameters. Clearly,           with the performance data discussed&#13;
     there are utilities that are leading the group    earlier in Section 2. It is also observed that&#13;

            Water operators partnership : Africa
            utility performance assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary aim of this report is to
            take stock of African utilities' performance in a few
            key areas in order to provide a sound basis for further
            development of the Water Operators Partnership (WOP) program
            in Africa. Specifically, the report aims to assist utilities
            in identifying their strengths and weaknesses as well as
            best practices under the WOP-Africa priority themes in order
            to uncover potential partnerships for improving performance.
            The end is not, therefore, the collection of metric data or
            the calculation of performance indicators, but rather the
            identification of performance gaps, benchmarking against
            superior performers and, ultimately, the implementation of
            performance improvements based on quantitative and
            qualitative data. The primary audience of the report is the
            utilities themselves, hence the stand on publishing the data
            as received after enquiries and clarifications and showing
            wide discrepancies and possible abnormalities. Sector
            professionals and officials engaged in the millennium
            Development Goal (MDG) challenges for water and sanitation
            services will also find this report useful as it is founded
            on the recognition that the drive to accelerate progress
            towards the MDGs for urban household (HH) has to focus on
            increasing the performance of the utility through reform and
            capacity building.
