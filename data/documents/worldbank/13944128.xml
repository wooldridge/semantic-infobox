            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2007 : creating opportunity
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Financial year 2007 was a remarkable one
            for International Finance Corporation (IFC). The author
            delivered strong, measurable development impact and
            continued to show how the private sector creates
            opportunities in emerging markets, especially for the poor
            people who most need help. The author also achieved the
            strongest financial position in our history. IFC's
            market is evolving. Today, nearly two-thirds of our client
            firms are based in emerging markets, and there is wide
            acknowledgment that the private sector plays a critical role
            in addressing the needs of people in these countries. Many
            firms the author invests in are expanding into other
            emerging markets: the author finance more than 20 such
            'South-South' transactions each year. IFC's
            Board of Directors reaffirmed the five strategic pillars
            this year: assisting frontier markets, including
            International Development Association (IDA) countries; b)
            building long-term relationships with local companies; c)
            ensuring environmental and social sustainability; d) helping
            the private sector strengthen infrastructure, from ports and
            roads to schools and hospitals; and e) developing local
            financial markets.
