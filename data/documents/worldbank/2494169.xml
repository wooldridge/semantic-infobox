Water, sanitation and hygiene are vital&#13;
components of sustainable development&#13;
and the alleviation of poverty. Across&#13;
Africa, political leaders and sector&#13;
specialists are generating new&#13;
momentum in these important areas.&#13;
This Field Note, together with the others&#13;
in the same series, constitutes a timely&#13;
contribution to that work. It is intended&#13;
principally to help politicians, leaders&#13;
and professionals in their activities. As&#13;
the Water Ambassador for Africa,&#13;
invited by the African Development&#13;
Bank and endorsed by the African Water&#13;
Task Force and the African Ministerial     Summary&#13;
Conference on Water (AMCOW),                 The Ugandan Government has been reforming the water and sanitation sector for the past&#13;
I commend it to your attention.              four years. This reform promises much. It is intimately linked to the government's poverty&#13;
                                             alleviation plans, and financed largely by debt relief funds. The government has led from the&#13;
                                             front, building a high level of trust and consensus with its sector development partners and&#13;

                                                The reform process has involved a comprehensive assessment of the water and sanitation&#13;
                                             sector, including studies of the rural and urban sub-sectors, and preparation of action and&#13;
                                             investment plans. The key strategies to emerge from these assessments include more&#13;
                                             decentralised delivery of services, increased private-sector participation, and the need for a&#13;
                                             programmatic, sector-wide approach.&#13;
                                                Many independent observers agree that it is the most dynamic and successful sector&#13;
                                             reform process in sub-Saharan Africa, with useful lessons for other countries. Yet, it is still too&#13;
                                             early to tell how effective the reforms will be in translating the good intentions into tangible&#13;
                                             improvements in water and sanitation services to benefit poor people.&#13;

                           Uganda was devastated by prolonged conflict between          reduction initiatives&#13;
                           1971 and 1985. The fertile and once abundant nation&#13;
                           emerged from this period with deep scars: the economy&#13;

pressing ahead with reform of&#13;
its water and sanitation sector,&#13;

it has proposed. Nevertheless,&#13;
the sector reform process in&#13;
Uganda stands out, in two main&#13;
ways, from similar reforms under&#13;
way in other African countries.&#13;
· Firstly, the reform process is&#13;
being led by the Government&#13;
of Uganda (GoU), rather than&#13;
imposed from outside. The&#13;
reforms were built on domestic&#13;
development plans, and are&#13;
being      enacted        through&#13;
government channels. As a&#13;
result, there is a genuine sense&#13;
of ownership from those&#13;
involved in the reforms, and this&#13;
is driving a positive and&#13;
energetic reform process.&#13;
· Secondly, the reforms were&#13;

for genuine competition in the narrow market that exists in     responsibility for the sector reform extends beyond the&#13;

                                                                civil society organisations, has been involved throughout&#13;
Work in progress                                                the planning, design and review of the reform process.&#13;

    The reform of the water and sanitation sector in Uganda     and move the process forward.&#13;
&#13;
    is in its early days. Much of the reform process has still&#13;
    to be planned and implemented, and many of the              Effective sector reform attracts investment&#13;
    processes are ongoing. Decentralised service provision          Improved access to and delivery of basic services is central&#13;

institutions develop sufficient capacity to carry out their     sanitation sector is an attractive investment for both&#13;
functions effectively.                                          government and external support agencies. Total funding&#13;
    The transition to SWAP has been hindered by the sector's    to the Ugandan water and sanitation sector has grown by&#13;
relatively complex institutional environment, but it is now the an average of over 30% per annum since the sector reforms&#13;

· Re-alignment of existing projects and programmes              commitment to the sector has been demonstrated by&#13;
with SWAP principles                                            increases in its funding of 70% per annum.&#13;
· Formal agreement that external assistance will be provided&#13;
through budget support&#13;
· Revised modalities for funding&#13;
· Development of common rules, policies and accountability&#13;
requirements&#13;
· Formulation of action plan (in 2002) and sector investment&#13;
plan (by 2003)&#13;
    The actions agreed by the government and its&#13;
development partners at the Joint Sector Review address&#13;
many of the problems identified above, and augur well for&#13;
the future of the sector reform. The main actions were to:&#13;
reassess sector targets; prioritise resources for sanitation&#13;
and hygiene promotion; carry out tariff and pricing policy&#13;
reviews; and ensure improved provision of services to the&#13;
urban poor.&#13;

&#13;
Lessons learned&#13;
&#13;
Government leadership is crucial to success&#13;
    Government-led reforms are always likely to be more&#13;
effective than externally imposed ones. In this case, building&#13;
the reforms on the GoU strategy for economic&#13;
transformation and linking them to the PRSP process has&#13;
engendered government ownership of the reform process,&#13;
and made the GoU genuinely committed to leading rapid&#13;
and effective change in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Effective sector reform requires&#13;
broad ownership of the process&#13;
    It is important that the sense of ownership and&#13;

            Water and sanitation sector reform in
            Uganda : a government-led transformation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Ugandan Government has been
            reforming the water and sanitation sector for the past four
            years. This reform promises much. It is intimately linked to
            the government's poverty alleviation plans, and
            financed largely by debt relief funds. The government has
            led from the front, building a high level of trust and
            consensus with its sector development partners and with
            civil society stakeholders, and initiating progressive and
            innovative reforms throughout the sector. The reform process
            has involved a comprehensive assessment of the water and
            sanitation sector, including studies of the rural and urban
            sub-sectors, and preparation of action and investment plans.
            The key strategies to emerge from these assessments include
            more decentralized delivery of services, increased
            private-sector participation, and the need for a
            programmatic, sector-wide approach. Many independent
            observers agree that it is the most dynamic and successful
            sector reform process in sub-Saharan Africa, with useful
            lessons for other countries. Yet, it is still too early to
            tell how effective the reforms will be in translating the
            good intentions into tangible improvements in water and
            sanitation services to benefit poor people.
