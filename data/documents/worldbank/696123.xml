A. BACKGROUND&#13;
Health status, health system and financing prior to the war.&#13;
1.      By the end of the 1980s, the contrast between the development of health care services and the&#13;
uneven achievements in health status suggested that systemic problems were limiting further progress in&#13;
health outcomes in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH)1. Like most other formerly socialist economies in&#13;
Central and Eastern Europe, BH had a well developed health system. The whole population enjoyed&#13;
reasonable access to a large network of clinics, hospitals and public health facilities. There were 5.8&#13;
hospital beds per 1,000 population and 2.6 doctors per 1,000 population.2 There were 46,000 health&#13;
workers, of whom about 65% were professionally qualified. On the one hand, the system had achieved&#13;
remarkable coverage and the use of high technology; on the other hand, some key health status&#13;
indicators still showed low achievements.&#13;
2.      Although substantial gains were achieved in health outcomes during the two decades preceding&#13;
the war, the indicators of health status showed a mixed picture. The infant mortality rate had declined&#13;
from 56 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 21 per 1,000 live births in 1991. But, partially due to the weak&#13;
primary care network, the percentage of infants immunized against childhood illnesses in 1991 was less&#13;
than in other European socialist countries, with the exception of the former USSR. While the age-&#13;
standardized mortality rate for communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal causes (87 per 100,000&#13;
population) was worse than the average of 52 per 100,000 for other European socialist countries, the life&#13;
expectancy of 73 years at birth was at the higher end of the range observed in the region.&#13;
3.      The pre-war health system suffered from a number of problems. A supply-dominated&#13;
approach to centralized planning had led to the proliferation of large hospitals and heavy reliance on&#13;
specialized poly-clinics, with relatively little attention being given to primary health care or family&#13;
practice. The centralized decision-making process did not encourage strategic planning to achieve the&#13;
most efficient use of resources. Instead, decisions were most often the result of bureaucratic bargaining,&#13;
rather than a rational assessment of needs and available resources. Clinical decisions were not based on&#13;
considerations of the effectiveness or costs of the desired interventions.&#13;
4.      Total health expenditure was around 6.5 percent of GDP, leading to an annual health&#13;
expenditure per capita of about $150 in 1991, which was on the high side of the range encountered in the&#13;
region. In addition to the large infrastructure, the reasons for these high costs were that payments were&#13;
based on norms for number of beds, items of equipment, as well as staff and size of buildings, all of&#13;
which combined to create perverse incentives. Over-specialization and high rates of utilization, referrals&#13;
and prescribing also contributed to high costs.&#13;
5.      As part of the wider Yugoslav system, a health insurance system operated through a parastatal&#13;
fund which had limited autonomy. It essentially funded activities carried out by the existing public&#13;
services. Funds for health care were raised through a compulsory payroll-based scheme with&#13;
contributions from employer and employee, passed through the health insurance fund in Sarajevo. With&#13;
a minuscule official unemployment, 74% of health insurance income came from state&#13;
1     Bosnia and Herzegovina is composed of two entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the&#13;
Federation) and the Republika Srpska (RS).&#13;

- 2-&#13;
workers/enterprises, 19% from the pension fund and about 7% from the agricultural/private sector, while&#13;
co-payments were low but increasing. A plan to deal with the increasing imbalance between health&#13;
sector costs and revenue was initiated shortly before the war. It called for strengthening the role of the&#13;
health insurance fund as an independent purchaser, encouraging private provision of health services,&#13;
ensuring that the expenditure of the insurance fund did not exceed its income, and increasing co-&#13;
payments. The implementation of this plan was prevented by the war.&#13;
Impact of The War on Health Status and the Health Care System&#13;
6.       The war has taken an enormous toll on the health status of the population. The drastic&#13;
reduction of access to priority health services at the primary and secondary levels, decline in living&#13;
conditions, malnutrition and intense psychological stress have caused dramatic declines in overall health&#13;
status of the population. Based on information from Sarajevo, the infant mortality rate is estimated to&#13;
have doubled, reaching an average of 30 to 40 per 1,000 live births in urban areas. The incidence of&#13;
serious congenital malformations rose from 0.7% to 2.1% of births during the war. Almost 25% of these&#13;
malformations were anencephalus (absence of a brain) or hydrocephalus (excessive water in the brain),&#13;
which will have been detected during the pre-natal period and managed appropriately, had access to and&#13;
functions of diagnostic and treatment services not been severely constrained during the war. Similarly,&#13;
premature births have doubled, while the average birth weight has dropped by more than 20 percent. The&#13;
rate of perinatal mortality rose from about 15.3 per 1,000 live births before the war to 38.6 per thousand&#13;
during the conflict. Available data on morbidity show a two- to five-fold increase in the number of&#13;
people affected by epidemics and communicable diseases (influenza, tuberculosis, hemorrhagic fever),&#13;
with a surge in the number of fatal cases. Although reliable figures are scant, the MOH in each entity&#13;
reports an increasing trend in infant and matemal mortality, tuberculosis, mental disorders and suicides,&#13;
accidents and mortalities due to chronic diseases.&#13;
7.       In the area of reproductive health3, family planning as reflected by contraceptive use had never&#13;
been given a high priority within the health care system of formner Yugoslavia. As a result, the incidence&#13;
of induced abortion was traditionally high. With the onset of the war, the number of induced abortions&#13;
increased significantly. Pre- and intra-war data for Sarajevo indicate that abortions increased from a&#13;
ratio of one for every birth to at least two for every birth. The high rate of abortions, especially under&#13;
constrained medical resources, including the capacity to sterilize equipment, creates the condition for&#13;
subsequent low-grade infections and infertility. With the end of the conflict, particular attention will&#13;
need to be given to primary prevention of unwanted pregnancies with contraceptives, as opposed to the&#13;
dependency on abortion as a secondary prevention technique, as well to infertility counseling and clinical&#13;
services.&#13;

Hospital Infrastructure&#13;
8.      The hospital infrastructure has suffered major damage as a result of the war. The direct&#13;
(damage or destruction due to shelling) and indirect (absence of maintenance and repair due to lack of&#13;
resources) effects of the war have led to a collapse or loss of function of a significant portion of the&#13;
hospitals. The deterioration and destruction of physical facilities have constrained the availability of&#13;
good quality physical space for the provision of essential hospital services. Some equipment cannot be&#13;
used due to disrupted electrical systems. In some hospitals, uncompleted structures are deteriorating due&#13;
to prolonged exposure to the elements.&#13;
9.      In the Federation, the destruction of hospital buildings has led to the elimination of about 35%&#13;
of beds and the loss of function of many others. About 7,700 hospital beds remain "active" throughout&#13;
the Federation (3 beds per 1,000 population). The Federation MOH plans to develop a streamlined and&#13;
efficient hospital system, based on a network of eight cantonal hospitals and the three Clinical Centers in&#13;
Mostar, Sarajevo and Tuzla. A summary of the methods used for the assessment of hospital&#13;
infrastructure is presented below. Detailed estimates are shown in Appendix 1.&#13;
10.     Program preparation and appraisal were based on several documents and the outputs of the&#13;
Working Group of the Federation MOH. A War Damage Assessment was prepared with the assistance&#13;
of the International Management Group (IMG) in April, 1996. The process involved five teams of BH&#13;
nationals. Each team included an architect, a civil engineer, a plumbing and sewage specialist, a&#13;
mechanical engineer and an electrical engineer. This assessment was a useful source of data for the&#13;
appraisal. The War Damage Assessment report was further modified by the Working Group of the&#13;
Federation MOH to include various "projects" that the Working Group found judicious, many of which&#13;
were parts of a long term program interrupted by the war. It was necessary to identify more clearly the&#13;
objectives and nature of the various projects in order to justify selections on the basis of explicit and&#13;
rational criteria. The criteria for inclusion in the Federation Program were the following:&#13;
*  Relation to war: In addition to repairing direct and indirect war damage, the completion of work interrupted&#13;
by war and new construction considered critical were eligible for inclusion in the broad Program.&#13;
*  Essential care: Program should focus on essential care, avoiding unnecessary hi-tech equipment. The&#13;
facilities should ensure hygienic conditions of care for patients and efficient conditions of work for doctors,&#13;
nurses and para-medical professionals.&#13;
*  Geographical distribution: The number of functioning beds after completion of civil works should be&#13;
approximately uniform across the Federation and less than or equal to 4 beds per 1000 inhabitants. About&#13;
10% of the beds should be used for tertiary care.&#13;
*  Time: Projects should be implementable within a short period, say 2 or 3 years at most.&#13;
*  Effectiveness: Civil works should enable buildings to be effective (i. e., to function and enable workers to&#13;
deliver care) immediately after completion.&#13;
*  Funding: Beyond the criteria specified, no arbitrary limit was fixed for the Federation MOH Program. It was&#13;
clear that the Government and donors had limited resources, hence decisions were based on criteria of need,&#13;
relevance to efficient service delivery and prospects for sustainability. The rationale for this approach was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
that donors will finance the most urgent priorities as functional modules, hence there was no need to set an&#13;
arbitrary ceiling on the Program.&#13;
11.    Table la below shows the estimated needs for civil works in the Federation. Two broad categories are&#13;
presented: clinical services (wards, clinics and operating theaters) and general services (for example, laundry and&#13;
kitchen). The needs in the area of clinical services are sub-divided into: rehabilitation of damaged structures,&#13;
completion of work already begun and construction of new buildings. The needs in general services sub-divided&#13;
into: general service buildings and general service equipment. The presentation of needs by categories, sub-&#13;
categories and by hospital provides a basis for the flexible packaging of inputs to be financed by donors while&#13;
maintaining a focus on functional service delivery units. The proposed Essential Hospital Services Project in the&#13;
Federation was defined from a series of modules identified by the Federation MOH in collaboration with the&#13;
Bank.&#13;

12.      In the Republika Srpska, the total number of hospital beds is about 5,200, approximately 5 per&#13;
1,000 population. About 4,213 hospital beds (4 beds per 1,000 population) are planned for the priority&#13;
hospitals identified by the RS MOH. The RS MOH has made initial estimates of the civil works needs,&#13;
and, in July 1996, made contact with the IMG with the intention of refining these estimates with the&#13;
assistance of the IMG, using professional methods similar to those applied in the Federation. Table lb&#13;

14.      The stock of diagnostic and therapeutic equipment was subjected to varying degrees of&#13;
disrepair, lack of maintenance and direct destruction during the war. Further complicating the situation,&#13;
significant amounts of equipment were transferred from civilian institutions to war hospitals during the&#13;
conflict. Although some equipment remain fully functional, a substantial part of the stock has been&#13;
affected by a lack of spare parts and scheduled maintenance. Table 2 below shows a categorical&#13;
distribution of supply gaps as reported by the International Committee of the Red Cross in a study&#13;
involving 68 hospital representatives. The study was conducted between April 1994 and May 1995.&#13;
There is a need to restore an adequate stock of equipment for essential hospital services, within the&#13;
projected capacity of the health system to sustain these investments.&#13;

15.     In March 1996 and July 1996, as part of the preparation of the Essential Hospital Services&#13;
Program of each entity, studies of medical equipment needs and sustainable investments in this area were&#13;
conducted by Working Groups of nationals established by the Federation MOH and the RS MOH. The&#13;
studies used methods and expatriate technical assistance from the Center for Research on Biomedical&#13;
Technology in Trieste, Italy, and was actively supported by IDA and the WHO. In the Federation, the&#13;
global replacement value of installed medical equipment in the 11 priority hospitals identified by the&#13;
Federation MOH was estimated at US$40 million. About a quarter of this equipment is partially or&#13;
totally out of order, mainly due to the lack of maintenance, spare parts and consumables during the war.&#13;
In the RS, the global replacement value of the installed medical equipment in the nine priority hospitals&#13;
and the Public Health Institute, Banja Luka, was estimated at US$22 million. Details of the methods for&#13;
the assessment of essential hospital equipment and supplies, as well as the results of the assessment, are&#13;
contained in the appendices, and more extensive documentation available in the Project files.&#13;
16.     In both entities, the activities in some basic diagnostic and therapeutic services, including&#13;
radiology, clinical laboratory and hemodialysis, are largely dependent upon donations of consumable&#13;
materials and the delivery of such services, hence service availability is unpredictable. Locai technical&#13;
personnel, already working in the hospitals, could assure adequate maintenance of the equipment, if&#13;
provided with training, technical documentation and spare parts. The use of local personnel will result in&#13;
substantial savings in maintenance costs. Supplies and pharmaceuticals were provided by internationial&#13;
humanitarian organizations and NGOs during the war. The principal contributors to pharmaceutical&#13;
supplies and stock management have included Pharmaciens Sans Frontieres (PSF) and the World Health&#13;
Organization (WHO). These efforts enabled the war-time health care system to meet a substantial&#13;
proportion of its essential needs. However, partly due to a weak local stock management capacity and&#13;
provision of inappropriate supplies by some other organizations that lacked the technical expertise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
needed to determine real requirements, large quantities of expired pharmaceuticals remain in the system&#13;
and are currently being identified and destroyed. The Ministry of Health in each entity is currently&#13;
conducting activities in support of the development of a policy on pharmaceuticals, with the assistance of&#13;
the WHO.&#13;
Clinical Skills and Quality of Care&#13;
17.     Basic education and in-service training were disrupted by the war. Established curricula could&#13;
not be adhered to, on account of damage to infrastructure, insecurity, loss of faculty and the absence of&#13;
required textbooks and supplies. In-service training and continuing education were severely constrained,&#13;
as the emphasis was on responding to the immediate needs imposed by war-time casualties, and there&#13;
was very limited access to professional joumals. Doctors and nurses have not maintained knowledge of&#13;
the use of modern, cost-effective medical technology.&#13;
18.     The combination of inadequate equipment, loss of some of the most capable professionals and&#13;
a weakened educational system has resulted in decreased clinical skills and quality of care in the&#13;
hospitals. There is a clear need to ensure that the care provided in hospitals is consistent with modem&#13;
and safe practices by restoring and improving upon in-service training for doctors, nurses and laboratory&#13;
technologists, and by providing adequate equipment, joumals and books for self-instruction.&#13;
19.     Improving the quality of care is important both in practical terms and conceptually. Although&#13;
only a limited study of health status and health outcomes in BH was conducted in the preparation of this&#13;
Project, emphasis was placed on two other dimensions of quality: structures and processes. "Structure"&#13;
refers to the buildings and equipment discussed earlier. The underlying assumption is that without&#13;
proper settings and functioning equipment, good medical care cannot occur. From the earlier&#13;
presentation of civil works and equipment requirements, it is evident that additional resources are&#13;
required to provide adequate buildings and equipment for appropriate care in BH. "Process" considers&#13;
not only that medical technology exists, but also whether what is known to be scientifically sound health&#13;
care is applied, such as appropriate clinical history, physical examinations, diagnostic tests, justification&#13;
of diagnosis and therapy. The assumption is that without proper procedures, good health outcomes&#13;
cannot be obtained. Clearly, the process of care in BH needs to be improved to guarantee care of good&#13;
quality to the population.&#13;
Health Care Financing&#13;
20.     The unified financing system collapsed during the war. Three "systems" emerged, two for the&#13;
Federation and a separate one for RS. As for the current Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in&#13;
Bosnian-majority areas, the insurance fund merged with the Ministry of Health in January 1994. In the&#13;
HVO Army-controlled area, a separate insurance fund has been in operation since 1993.&#13;
21.     In the Federation, knowledge about the current sources of financing for the health sector is&#13;
very patchy. Non-payment of salaries, donations in kind and amassed debts mean that the health system&#13;
has been and remains demonetized to a large extent. There are at least seven major sources of financing&#13;
for health services in the Federation:&#13;
* budget payments from the Federal Ministry of Finance for nine (later 10) institutions in the former&#13;
BH Army-controlled areas;&#13;
* funds (magnitude unknown and unestimated) originating in, or channeled through, cantons and&#13;
municipalities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
*  the health insurance fund in HVO Army-controlled areas;&#13;
*  unestimated private out-of-pocket fee-for-service payments for both public and private care;&#13;
* international assistance through multilateral and bilateral agencies and NGOs (unestimated);&#13;
*  debts (total debts are estimated to be over $200 million); and&#13;
*  military funds for war hospitals and clinics (unestimated).&#13;
22.     There are substantial differences in resource availability between the areas controlled by the&#13;
BH Army and the territory controlled by the HVO Army. Using tentative data for December 1995,&#13;
expenditure in the HVO army controlled areas is almost twice that of the BH Army controlled area (6.2&#13;
DM per capita per month compared with 3.2 DM per capita per month). Salaries are low throughout the&#13;
Federation, but were almost three times higher in the HVO army controlled areas (614 DM per health&#13;
worker per month on average) compared to the BH army controlled areas (215 DM) in December 1995.&#13;
In March 1996, salaries for health sector workers in the areas formerly controlled by the BH Arrny were&#13;
increased to 520 DM per month, but counterparts have advised that these increases have not been fully&#13;
sustained since March.&#13;
23.     In Republika Srpska, the main institution for health care financing is the Public Health Fund, which&#13;
is engaged in the collection and distribution of capital through regional funds that in turn undertake direct&#13;
payment to health institutions for services at prices set by the Public Health Fund. These prices are not based&#13;
on actual cost and payments to health institutions, and therefore, they do not cover even the minimum needs&#13;
of the health system. Salaries declined drastically during the war -- a doctor received, and still receives,&#13;
about DM 75 per month. Other health workers receive about DM 45 per month. Money for the Public Fund&#13;
comes from compulsory contributions of 14 percent of employees' salaries, paid by employers. In addition,&#13;
the government assumes responsibility for the unmet financial needs of the Public Fund, a responsibility that&#13;
could not be met during the war.&#13;
24 .    Health insurance contributions covered only 20 percent of costs between 1991 and 1996,&#13;
whereas all citizens had access to the services in principle. About 2 to 3 percent of the total income of&#13;
health institutions came from user charges, while 30 to 40 percent of health institutions' expenditures&#13;
were covered by humanitarian assistance (drugs and supplies, food, etc.). The RS MOH plans major&#13;
changes in the health financing system, including the introduction of voluntary health insurance in&#13;
addition to the existing compulsory health insurance. In this planned system, groups of beneficiaries of&#13;
free health services will be restricted to pregnant women, mothers of infants, persons aged less than 15&#13;
years or over 70 years, those suffering from infectious diseases or mental illnesses, patients requiring&#13;
renal dialysis, and others yet to be specified. The government will be responsible for these groups and&#13;
for those unable to contribute to either health insurance fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY: FROM EMERGENCY TO DEVELOPMENT&#13;
25.      With the end of the war, the health sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina faces a triple challenge.&#13;
It must: continue to function on an emergency basis for some time; undertake its recovery; and transition&#13;
to a modem efficient system. First, and for some time to come, the sector professionals will continue to&#13;
live and work under emergency-type conditions. With living conditions still precarious, controllable&#13;
epidemics will continue to break out, and health services will still handle larger proportions of&#13;
emergency cases and war-related injuries than their colleagues in the average country. Second, the&#13;
reconstruction must start without delay. Especially in light of severe resource constraints, this puts an&#13;
enormous pressure on sector authorities to prioritize activities and to plan large investments quickly, in&#13;
many cases without access to all relevant information. Such plans will have to be guided by the&#13;
judicious use of the most reasonable estimates of resource availability and prospects for sustainability.&#13;
Third, and highly critical, the reconstruction effort must avoid rebuilding the unwieldy pre-war health&#13;
system. This requires that much attention be given to the right balance between modem primary health&#13;
care services and high quality but streamlined hospital services.&#13;
Developing a medium term strategy&#13;
26.      The Federation: Initiating its response to the above-mentioned challenges, with the assistance&#13;
of WHO/EURO, the Federation MOH has outlined the guiding principles for the development of a&#13;
national master plan for the country's health sector recovery4. This document covers both the short-term&#13;
reconstruction needs and the future structure and functions of the health sector that could be achieved in&#13;
the medium-term. Five pillars were identified in the master plan: (i) health system design (sector profile,&#13;
health financing, administrative and organizational structures); (ii) human resources development; (iii)&#13;
development of the infrastructure and basic essentials (physical reconstruction, medical equipment and&#13;
supplies, pharmaceuticals, information systems); (iv) public health programs (communicable diseases&#13;
and epidemics, non-communicable diseases, nutrition and health promotion, maternal and child health/&#13;
family planning, environmental health); and (v) rehabilitation (physical and psycho-social/mental).&#13;
These pillars also constitute the framework for the Task Forces that the Federation MOH has established&#13;
or intends to establish for specifying the reconstruction and reform master plan.&#13;
27.      The Republika Srpska: With the assistance of WHO/EURO, the RS MOH has prepared its&#13;
Strategy of Health Development for Republika Srpska by the Year 2000, which outlines the guiding&#13;
principles for the development of the health system5. This document covers both the short-to-medium&#13;
term goals and the means to achieve the goals in broad terms. It includes a global policy framework and&#13;
health situation and trends, targets to be achieved by the Year 2000, development of health care and&#13;
insurance systems, public and private mix, drug policy, as well as priorities in health service investment.&#13;

Immediate Interventions to Restore Essential Hospital Services&#13;
28.      Immediate restoration of the most essential quantity and quality of hospital services is a&#13;
precondition for improving the overall viability of health services. In order to ensure that immediate&#13;
interventions are consistent with medium-term development objectives, short-term investments need to&#13;
be and are being undertaken concurrently with a fundamental review of the hospital sub-sector, in&#13;
recognition of the fact that hospitals accounted for the vast majority of public sector health expenditure&#13;
before the war.&#13;
29.      The MOH of each entity has prepared an Essential Hospital Services Program as part of the&#13;
effort to: (i) reduce the burden of illnesses and deaths, and (ii) provide an effective means for&#13;
rationalizing the functions, size, and financing of the hospital sub-sector. The Programs were prepared in&#13;
March - July 1996 by Working Groups of BH health professionals, with the understanding that IDA and&#13;
other donors will support coherent modules thereof as "projects". The proposed Essential Hospital&#13;
Services Project comprises selected priority modules from the Program of each entity. In order to&#13;
provide flexibility in co-financing decisions by donors and in order to facilitate implementation, modules&#13;
of the Program for each entity can be defined as follows:&#13;
*  by hospital, i.e., the needs of individual hospitals across a range of components; or&#13;
*  by component/input category, i.e., the needs of some or all hospitals for a specified component.&#13;
30.    The principle for decision making on modules to be implemented is that major donor inputs&#13;
finance activities resulting in functional service delivery units. However, the specific combination of&#13;
modules remains subject to change, in view of the variations among potential donor contributions in&#13;
terms of amount, interests, geographical foci, timing and technical expertise. Table 3a below shows the&#13;
estimate Program needs by component and by entity. The physical rehabilitation and reconstruction&#13;
estimates for RS are subject to revision following further professional assessment by the IMG, as&#13;
requested by the RS MOH in July 1996.&#13;

31.      Table 3b (Priority Health Services and Levels of Service Delivery) illustrates the expected&#13;
roles of secondary-level hospital services in: (i) meeting the needs of the most epidemiologically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
vulnerable segments of the population; (ii) serving as the functional linkage between primary care and&#13;
tertiary care. Secondary-level hospital services will, for example, provide back-up for the future&#13;
primary health care being defined by the MOH of each entity. For example, where a screening test at&#13;
the sub-hospital level shows that a woman has pre-invasive cancer of the cervix at the sub-hospital level,&#13;
there will be appropriate treatment at the secondary hospital level.&#13;
Developing a sustainable health care financing regime&#13;
32.     The Federation: The Federation plans to introduce new heath financing arrangements in the&#13;
medium- to long-term, as stated by the Government of BH in the Letter of Development Policy dated&#13;
May 15, 1995 (Transition Assistance Credit, Report and Recommendation of the President of the&#13;
International Development Association, Number P-691 1-BIH, August 14, 1996). The plan calls for the&#13;
establishment of a three-tiered system of health insurance. The first tier will ensure that all people have&#13;
access to a Federation-specified package of basic services that is uniform across the Federation. At the&#13;
option of each canton, a second compulsory tier will provide coverage for a canton-specified&#13;
supplementary package of health care, financed by a mandatory payroll tax. A third tier of voluntary&#13;
private insurance, financed by private premiums, will cover enhanced amenities of care and additional&#13;
services not included under the compulsory services. Compulsory insurance will be managed and&#13;
administered at the cantonal level. Nevertheless, this will occur within Federation guidelines. Uniform&#13;
data reporting requirements for service utilization, for health revenue and expenditure patterns, and for&#13;
standard indicators of health sector inputs, outcomes and management will apply to all cantons. Other&#13;
guidelines will relate to service use outside the canton in which an individual is insured and to the&#13;
operation of cantonal insurance organizations.&#13;
33.     The first tier will be funded through a Federation Health Fund, to be financed from two&#13;
sources. First, a nominal contribution from the payroll tax will be paid into a Federation Health Fund.&#13;
Second, matching transfers from the budget, up to a limited amount per month, could be made to the&#13;
Fund. The combined funds from both sources will be divided on a per capita basis and returned to the&#13;
cantons, to be used for financing basic health services under Tier I of the new insurance arrangements.&#13;
The Government of BH has undertaken to "ensure that any new health insurance legislation provides for&#13;
the continued existence and function of this fund."&#13;
34.      Republika Srpska: According to the "Strategy of Health Development for Republika Srpska&#13;
by the Year 2000", the health insurance system in RS will aim to achieve a balance between health care&#13;
needs on the one hand and the limited financial resources on the other. The RS MOH plans to have one&#13;
compulsory insurance system and optional private insurance systems. The compulsory system will cover&#13;
the entire population, with an administrative structure comprising one Public Health Fund (the health&#13;
insurance fund) and eight branch offices. In this scenario, all resources will pass through the central&#13;
Fund. The branch (municipal) offices will pay, inter alia, for maternity clinics, travel costs for referred&#13;
patients, and free aids for children, such as spectacles and orthopedic devices. Prices will be determined&#13;
by the central Fund. Contributions will be paid by employees and employers for the employed and their&#13;
families - 28 percent of salaries, with equal shares paid by employer and employee. Self-employed&#13;
people and farmers will also pay contributions. The RS Government will pay for those with low income&#13;
(undefined), invalids and indigent families of soldiers killed during the war, as well as other population&#13;
groups exempt from insurance contributions and from co-payments. At this stage, little or no financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
projections underpinning the RS MOH's intentions have been prepared. Governance and regulatory&#13;
mechanisms are equally vague. The technical assistance planned under the proposed Project will, inter&#13;
alia, help the RS MOH resolve these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
C. IDA ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
35.      The Government's sector strategy is being developed in collaboration with and supported by&#13;
the WHO and IDA. A Recovery Program for the Health Sector of BH, estimated at US$540 million&#13;
over 3 to 4 years, was submitted in December 1995 for consideration to the international donor&#13;
community. This program, which is part of the US$5.1 billion Government reconstruction program,&#13;
encompasses all priority areas that require immediate attention and support, in order to prevent further&#13;
deterioration in the health status of the BH population and progressively rehabilitate the health services&#13;
delivery system. The Recovery Program also supports the efforts needed to initiate structural reforms,&#13;
thus promoting the sector's sustainability in the recovering Bosnian economy.&#13;
36.     IDA and the WHO are supporting in the short-term a series of operations which address cost-&#13;
effectively the most relevant and pressing health issues with which BH is confronted, and which are&#13;
consistent with a streamlined system in the medium term. The overall objective is to minimize lost&#13;
productivity and to alleviate suffering by reducing the burden of disease on the most at-risk segments of&#13;
the population, namely the direct victims of the war, and the women and children of BH. Improvements&#13;
in the areas presented in Table 3b below, however, will extend much beyond these target groups. The&#13;
entire population of BH will benefit from the cost-effective health services the proposed operations are&#13;
intended to support, as they constitute the initial vehicles to carry out the fundamental changes required&#13;
by the BH health care system. Table 3b shows the main elements of the health care system envisaged for&#13;
the medium-term, with primary care provision at the sub-hospital level, the most essential hospital&#13;
services in secondary-level facilities, and the most technically sophisticated services in the tertiary&#13;
hospitals or clinical centers. Each of these is necessary, and none is sufficient by itself. The three levels&#13;
of care will be linked through efficient referral practices.&#13;
37.     Three operations supported by IDA are included in the early stages of assistance to the health&#13;
sector of the Federation. As the first step in addressing the extensive needs, a new and more cost-&#13;
effective approach to physical and psycho-social rehabilitation services was developed by the Federation&#13;
MOH, with assistance from IDA, WHO and others. The Project, with a total cost of US$30.0 million,&#13;
was approved by the Board of Directors of IDA on May 16, 1996, and is being financed as the first&#13;
reconstruction initiative in the health sector: the War Victims Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
38.     The second operation is the proposed Essential Hospital Services Project, which will cover&#13;
both entities and focus on the most urgent needs in the hospital sub-sector as well as support for the&#13;
reform of the health finance system. The rationale for selecting this priority operation on Essential&#13;
Hospital Services rests on several considerations, including: (a) the need to address quickly the most&#13;
pressing hospital needs within a rational framework, thereby reducing the risk that uncoordinated and&#13;
expensive investments in the health sector will jeopardize sustainability; (b) the demonstrated&#13;
commitment of the Ministry of Health of each entity to the proposed operation; and (c) the uncertainty&#13;
that still prevails about the future organization of primary health care while the strategic options for a&#13;
third operation -- the Basic Health Services Program -- are being defined through a process led by the&#13;
MOH of each entity, with the support of the WHO and the Bank. It is envisaged that an IDA-supported&#13;
operation focusing on Basic Health Services will be presented to the Board of Directors for consideration&#13;
during the second half of CY97.&#13;

D. SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT&#13;
39.     The Essential Hospital Services Project is a single operation with two parts, one for each of the&#13;
two entities -- the Federation and RS. The Project was derived from modules of the Essential Hospital&#13;
Services Program of each entity. Sections D and E focus, respectively, on the details of project&#13;
components for each of the two entities. The institutional arrangements and implementation plans are&#13;
covered in Section F, followed by justification, benefits and risks in Section G. Table 4 below shows a&#13;
summary of the Project costs by component and by entity.&#13;

40.     In the Federation, the Project will include eight cantonal hospitals, as well as the secondary-&#13;
level facilities in the three Clinical Centers. The cantonal hospitals are located in Bihac, Gorazde, Jajce,&#13;
Livno, Orasje, Travnik, Zenica and Sarajevo (the State Hospital). The clinical centers are in Mostar,&#13;
Sarajevo and Tuzla. The proposed Project was conceived and packaged within the framework of the&#13;
broader Program, which was prepared in April, 1996 by a Working Group established by the Federation&#13;
Ministry of Health and appraised by an IDA mission in May, 1996. The proposed Project is a sub-set of&#13;
this Program, focusing on (i) investments to restore services at the secondary (cantonal) hospital level,&#13;
and (ii) priority health finance reforms.&#13;
41.     In RS, the Project will include eight general hospitals, secondary-level functions in the Banja&#13;
Luka Clinical Center, as well as the Institute of Public Health in Banja Luka. The eight general hospitals&#13;
are in Prijedor, Gradiska, Doboj, Bijelina, Trebinje, Brcko, Zvomik, and Pale/Kasindol/ Sokolac. The&#13;
Project will not include the construction of any new facility. As in the Federation, the Project in the RS&#13;
is a module derived from the broader Program being prepared by a Working Group of the RS MOH with&#13;
the assistance of IDA and the WHO. The leadership of the Republika Srpska Ministry expressed its&#13;
agreement with the content of this module during a series of discussions with a Bank mission in July&#13;
1996.&#13;

E. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
THE PROJECT IN THE FEDERATION OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA&#13;
Project Objectives and Components&#13;
42.      The overall objective of the proposed Essential Hospital Services Project is to support the&#13;
development of a modem, cost-effective and fiscally sustainable hospital sub-sector as a part of the&#13;
overall Essential Hospital Services Program. More specifically, the Project will: a) strengthen essential&#13;
hospital services at the cantonal level, focusing on the most needy segments of the population; and b)&#13;
establish and support the initial steps in health financing reforms. To accomplish these objectives, the&#13;
Federation part of the Project, estimated at a total cost of US$22.1 million, will support the development&#13;
and implementation of the following components:&#13;
a) Physical rehabilitation and reconstruction of essential hospital facilities (estimated cost&#13;
US$10.1 million). The Project will support the needed civil works to restore to adequate&#13;
operational conditions a network of eight cantonal hospitals and secondary-level facilities&#13;
in three clinical centers throughout the Federation. Only facilities that have remained&#13;
active throughout the war will be supported by the Project. Repairs and reconstruction will&#13;
focus on the priority structural, electrical, mechanical and heating systems -- collectively&#13;
described as "general services" -- for: (i) laundry, kitchen and sterilization; (ii) accident&#13;
and emergency services; (iii) diagnostic services; (iv) operating theaters for general&#13;
surgery, obstetrics and gynecology; (v) internal medicine; and (vi) neonatal intensive care&#13;
units.&#13;
b) Medical equipment and supplies (estimated cost US$7.4 million). The Project will provide&#13;
the selected hospitals with their most urgent needs in diagnostic and therapeutic equipment&#13;
for secondary-level care, as well as secure, for the duration of the Project, an adequate&#13;
supply of essential medical supplies. The Project will provide safe and cost-effective&#13;
equipment for radiology, hematology, and clinical chemistry. Equipment, instruments and&#13;
consumables will be provided for anesthesia, surgery, diagnostic and therapeutic obstetrics&#13;
and gynecology, internal medicine and neonatal intensive care units.&#13;
c) Upgrading of clinical skills and practices (estimated cost US$1.0 million). The Project&#13;
will provide technical assistance, training and equipment in support of: (i) the adaptation,&#13;
production and dissemination of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols for essential clinical&#13;
interventions of known cost-effectiveness; and (ii) in-service training for physicians,&#13;
nurses, midwives, and diagnostic and laboratory technologists.&#13;
d) Health finance reform (estimated cost US$2.9 million). The restoration of an adequate and&#13;
stable national financing system for the entire health sector in general, and the hospitals in&#13;
particular, constitutes a major challenge for economic recovery. This component will&#13;
support technical assistance, training, office equipment, limited civil works and&#13;
operational expenditures for: (i) the development of the new health financing system; (ii)&#13;
support to the institutions in charge of implementing the new system; and (iii) the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
development and implementation of an initial simplified phase of automated management&#13;
information systems. Emphasis will be on the establishment of a credible and effective&#13;
process, delivering interim products to facilitate the attainment of specified objectives&#13;
consistent with the Letter of Development Policy in the Transition Assistance Credit&#13;
(approved by the Board of Directors in September 1996).&#13;
e) Project implementation support (estimated base cost US$0.7 million). Given the very tight&#13;
fiscal position of BH during the initial period of recovery from the war, support will be&#13;
provided to cover most required foreign and local costs of implementing the Project&#13;
through support to a Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The Project will support all&#13;
needed investments (limited civil works, office equipment, technical assistance and&#13;
training) as well as incremental recurrent expenditures, which will be financed on a&#13;
declining basis for three years of operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Detailed Project Description&#13;
Physical rehabilitation and reconstruction of Essential Hospital Facilities component&#13;
43.    The Project will support repair and reconstruction activities to restore fully functional service&#13;
delivery units. These activities have been identified and prioritized using explicit criteria of need,&#13;
feasibility and affordability (see paragraph 10 and Appendix 1). Repairs and reconstruction will focus on&#13;
the priority structural, electrical, mechanical and heating systems for: (a) laundry, kitchen and&#13;
sterilization; (b) accident and emergency services; (c) diagnostic services; (d) operating theaters for&#13;
general surgery, obstetrics and gynecology; (e) internal medicine; and (f) neonatal intensive care units.&#13;
Specific lists of planned investments in each of the 1 I hospitals from which the project-supported&#13;
modules were selected are specified in Table I a and Appendix 1. Among the needs identified, the&#13;
proposed Project will cover the rehabilitation of damaged structures (wards/clinics/operating theaters),&#13;
repairs/renovations of general service buildings, and procurement/repairs of general service equipment in&#13;
eight cantonal hospitals.&#13;
Medical equipment and supplies component&#13;
44.        The Project will provide eight cantonal hospitals and three clinical centers with their most&#13;
urgent needs in diagnostic and therapeutic equipment for secondary-level care. The planned&#13;
investments, which will cover the priority first year requirements in eight cantonal hospitals and three&#13;
clinical centers (Appendix 2), include replacement of obsolete and/or irreparably damaged equipment,&#13;
within the projected capacity of the health system to sustain the recurrent costs of running the stock of&#13;
equipment. Given the serious financial constraints on the health system in the Federation, the Project&#13;
will also provide necessary supplies and consumables to support effective utilization of the equipment.&#13;
45.        Categories of equipment and supplies: The Project will provide safe and cost-effective&#13;
equipment for radiology, hematology, and clinical chemistry. Equipment, instruments and consumables&#13;
will be provided for anesthesia, surgery, diagnostic and therapeutic obstetrics and gynecology, internal&#13;
medicine and neonatal intensive care units. Specific lists of planned investments in each of the 11&#13;
hospitals are shown in Appendix 2.&#13;
Upgrading of clinical skills and practices component&#13;
46.        In order to achieve sustained improvements in the quality of health services provided in the&#13;
hospitals, diagnostic and therapeutic practices must be systematically upgraded. It is recognized that&#13;
structural improvements (civil works, equipment and supplies) are necessary but not sufficient to achieve&#13;
improved quality of care. Furthermore, poor quality of care results in inappropriate diagnoses and&#13;
avoidable complications, with associated costs of remedying conditions that could have been avoided&#13;
had the initial care been of good quality. For these clinical and economic reasons, the Project will&#13;
support the following: (a) the adaptation, production and dissemination of diagnostic and therapeutic&#13;
protocols for essential clinical interventions of known cost-effectiveness; and (b) in-service training for&#13;
physicians, nurses, midwives, and diagnostic and laboratory technologists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
47.        The activities to be supported by the Project will be organized around three Continuous&#13;
Medical Education Centers (CMEs), to be established in the medical library of each of the Clinical&#13;
Centers in the Federation. Each CME will serve a network of one Clinical Center and three to four&#13;
cantonal hospitals, starting with basic skills and progressively covering more specialized fields of&#13;
medicine.&#13;
48.        Equipment and Supplies. The Project will provide furniture, audio-visual equipment, books&#13;
and journals for the three Clinical Centers and eight cantonal hospitals. Audio-visual equipment will&#13;
include slide projectors, overhead projectors, computer workstations and Local Area Network (LAN)&#13;
with CD-ROMs, desktop publishing software and equipment for multi-media presentation. Each CME&#13;
will be provided with a core set of relevant medical journals. Basic textbooks and audio-visual materials&#13;
will be supplied to each cantonal hospital.&#13;
49.        Personnel and Training. The Project will support the development and implementation of&#13;
in-service local training for doctors, nurses, midwives and diagnostic and laboratory technicians.&#13;
Specifically, the Project will support: (a) the establishment and functioning of a Clinical Skills&#13;
Development Group, which will be developed under the umbrella of the Human Resources Development&#13;
Working Group of the Federation MOH; (b) the adaptation, production and dissemination of diagnostic&#13;
and therapeutic protocols for essential clinical interventions of known cost-effectiveness; and (c) in-&#13;
service training within each hospital, focusing on the development of skills required for the diagnoses&#13;
and treatments of the most common clinical conditions. The general approach will be to cover all&#13;
practising professionals -- doctors, nurses, technicians -- throughout the Project.&#13;
Health Finance Reform Component&#13;
50.        The future health financing system faces several challenges compared to the pre-war&#13;
situation. First, per capita health expenditure will be well below half of its pre-war level for at least the&#13;
next four years, while the expectations of health care professionals and the population will quickly&#13;
resume their pre-war levels. Second, the administration of health insurance will become much more&#13;
difficult as the administratively easier tax base of workers employed in state enterprises becomes much&#13;
smaller, and substantial decentralisation of both revenue-raising and contracting with health institutions&#13;
at the cantonal level will proceed, in parallel to the introduction of the cantonal supplementary&#13;
compulsory second-tier and third-tier voluntary health insurance. Finally, substantial damages to many&#13;
health insurance buildings and information systems and the communication infrastructure will constrain&#13;
the future operations of the FHIA.&#13;
51.        To assist in these drastic adaptations, the Project will support: (a) limited civil works to&#13;
establish new offices and the use of appropriate information technology for both administrative and&#13;
strategic purposes; (b) technical assistance in areas such as institutional arrangements for health&#13;
insurance, design of the basic package and human resource planning; (c) in-service training to support&#13;
the implementation of the health insurance system; and (d) the dissemination of information to&#13;
professionals in the Federation about comparable systems, both in other parts of the formner Yugoslavia&#13;
and beyond. Funds will be made available for staff from the Federal and cantonal levels to get the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
needed documentation and to participate in study visits to countries with relevant experience.&#13;
52.        Equipment and supplies. The Project will provide office technology for the existing&#13;
Federation Health Insurance Agency and the cantonal health fund offices. Equipment will be procured&#13;
along with equipment from other components of the Project.&#13;
53.        Technical Assistance. The broad objective of the technical assistance (TA) to be provided&#13;
under the Project will be to support, in both entities, the development of a credible and effective process,&#13;
delivering specific interim products, in pursuit of: (a) an overall design for a coherent health financing&#13;
system that will achieve universal access, cost-containment, quality, sustainability, effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency objectives, and (b) the portability of access to health care between the entities, within the&#13;
provisions of the constitution of BH. Technical assistance will help the Ministry of Health and&#13;
appropriate institutions in each entity to: (a) identify specific options, and the implications of those&#13;
options, for introducing a sustainable, efficient, effective and equitable health finance regime; (b)&#13;
conduct defined studies of limited scope in support of the decision making process in each entity; and (c)&#13;
develop the capacity of nationals of BH to manage the health sector reform process successfully.&#13;
54.        The Government of the United Kingdom, which has supported the preparation and appraisal&#13;
of this component, has expressed strong interest in at least partial financing of this Project component in&#13;
both the Federation and RS through the Know How Fund (KHF) of the Foreign and Commonwealth&#13;
Office. IDA and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are in the process of firming up this possibility.&#13;
Project Implementation Support Component&#13;
55.        Given the tight fiscal position of BH during the initial period of recovery from the war,&#13;
support will be sought to cover all required foreign and local incremental costs of project management.&#13;
These will include all needed investments (office equipment, technical assistance and training), as well&#13;
as recurrent expenditures for three years of operation. Since the required management capacity is&#13;
currently not available in the Federation MOH, an effective Project Implementation Unit will be created&#13;
within the MOH for the Essential Hospital Services Project. Personnel and equipment requirements for&#13;
this unit will be addition to those established for the War Victims Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
56.        The PIU will consist of a Project Director to manage and co-ordinate the implementation of&#13;
the Project; a Procurement Specialist to supervise tendering, purchasing and delivery of goods; an&#13;
Accountant to maintain project financial records; an Architect/Construction Engineer to coordinate and&#13;
supervise civil works activities; and the needed administrative support staff (secretaries and translators).&#13;
This core staff will constitute the PIU "Technical Team", which will establish linkages between the&#13;
Federation MOH and Canton Administrations to ensure the timely implementation of the Project. This&#13;
unit will be fully integrated with -- and strengthen -- the emerging administrative structure and&#13;
management capacity of the Federation MOH and will work closely with the existing PIU for War&#13;
Victims Rehabilitation Project, and will share technical expertise as much as possible. A team of&#13;
experts, comprised of members of the MOH working groups who designed the Project. will constitute the&#13;
"Essential Hospital Services Steering Committee". Further details regarding project implemenitation are&#13;
specified in Appendix 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Project Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
57.        Project Cost. The estimated total cost of Federation part of the Project is US$22.1 million&#13;
equivalent, including physical contingencies of three percent on goods, technical assistance, training and&#13;
recurrent costs, and seven percent on civil works. Price contingencies of 2.3% per year have been&#13;
included. Investment costs (US$20.2 million) covering civil works, medical equipment, vehicles,&#13;
technical assistance and training, constitute 91% of the total Project costs. Recurrent costs (US$1.9&#13;
million), including medical supplies, operation and maintenance of vehicles, as well as other operating&#13;
costs, constitute 9% of the total Project cost for the Federation. Detailed cost estimates are shown in&#13;
Appendix 3. They are net of taxes.&#13;
58.        Financing Plan. Bosnia and Herzegovina will be the recipient of the funds to be provided&#13;
by various donors. The government of Italy has committed US$5.2 million (eight billion Italian Lire),&#13;
and the governments of Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom have expressed interest&#13;
in financing parts of the Project. These expressions of interest are being followed up and additional&#13;
possibilities are being sought. In July 1996, a Bank mission assisted the Federation Ministry of Health to&#13;
prepare a draft work plan for its donor co-ordination office, with the objective of securing funds from&#13;
donors for this Project as well as the broader Program. If the needed co-financing were not available for&#13;
any reason, the Project scope will be reduced to fit within the available funds, with priority given to those&#13;
components to be financed through IDA (ITF) (see Table 5 below). Such a reduction will not in any&#13;
case reduce the viability of the Project, since the design was based on functional sub-units within the&#13;
Project, and the IDA(ITF)-financed components were based on the indispensable core priorities for&#13;
restoring essential hospital services.&#13;

59.    Environmental Aspects. Because this Project is not expected to have any adverse&#13;
environmental impact, it has not been placed in an environmental screening category. The Project will&#13;
follow accepted Bank procedures. All hospital services under the Program will incorporate appropriate&#13;
and safe disposal of wastes.&#13;

THE PROJECT IN THE REPUBLIKA SRPSKA&#13;
Project Objectives and Components&#13;
60.     The overall objective of the proposed Project in the RS is to support the strategies of the MOH&#13;
for the medium-term: to develop a modern, cost-effective and fiscally sustainable hospital sub-sector.&#13;
More specifically, this part of the Project will: a) strengthen essential hospital services focusing on the&#13;
most needy segments of the population; and b) establish and support the initial steps in health financing&#13;
reforms. To accomplish these objectives, this part of the Project, estimated at a total cost of US$11.5&#13;
million, will support the development and implementation of the following components:&#13;
a) Physical repairs at the Banja Luka Institute of Public Health (estimated cost US$0.7&#13;
million). The Project will support limited civil works to restore the diagnostic facilities of&#13;
the Institute to a fully functional status in support of the network of hospitals in the RS.&#13;
b) Medical equipment and supplies (estimated cost US$6.2 million). The Project will provide&#13;
the priority hospital facilities and the Institute of Public Health with their most urgent&#13;
needs in the repair of existing equipment, provision of supplies and consumables, as well&#13;
as maintenance of equipment for the duration of the Project.&#13;
c) Upgrading of clinical skills and practices (estimated cost US$0.9 million). The Project&#13;
will provide technical assistance, training and equipment in support of: (i) the adaptation,&#13;
production and dissemination of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols for essential clinical&#13;
interventions of known cost-effectiveness; and (ii) in-service training for physicians,&#13;
nurses, midwives, and diagnostic and laboratory technicians.&#13;
d) Health finance reform (estimated cost US$3.0 million). The restoration of an adequate and&#13;
stable financing system for the health sector in general, and the hospital sub-sector in&#13;
particular, constitutes a major challenge for economic recovery. The Project will support&#13;
technical assistance, training, office equipment, and operational expenditures for: (i) the&#13;
development of the new health finance system as proposed by the RS; (ii) support to the&#13;
institutions in charge of implementing the new system; and (iii) the development and&#13;
implementation of an automated management information system at the Public Fund for&#13;
Health and the institutions supported by the Project.&#13;
e) Project implementation support (estimated base cost US$0.7 million). Given the very tight&#13;
fiscal position of BH during the initial period of recovery from the war, support will be&#13;
provided to cover all required foreign and local costs of implementing the Project through&#13;
support to a Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The Project will support all needed&#13;
investments (limited civil works, office equipment, technical assistance and training) as&#13;
well as incremental recurrent expenditures for two years of operation. Necessary salary&#13;
costs and other related operational expenditures will be covered under the Project to&#13;
facilitate effectiveness of the PIU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Detailed Project Description&#13;
Physical repairs at the Banja Luka Institute of Public Health&#13;
61.     The Project will support limited civil works required by the Institute of Public Health in Banja&#13;
Luka. Repairs and reconstruction will focus on the priority structural, electrical, mechanical and heating&#13;
systems, including repairs of the roof and the basement. The completion of these activities will improve&#13;
the capacity of the Institute to accommodate the equipment used for diagnostic tests, including serology,&#13;
microbiology, culture and sensitivity tests.&#13;
Medical equipment and supplies component&#13;
62.     The Project will provide the eight priority hospitals, the Banja Luka Clinical Center and the&#13;
Institute of Public Health in Banja Luka with their most urgent needs in the repair of existing equipment,&#13;
supplies and consumables, as well as maintenance for the duration of the Project.&#13;
63.      Categories of equipment and supplies: The Project will provide support for: (i) urgently&#13;
needed repairs for an estimated 60% of the existing stock of equipment which is still viable; (ii) supplies&#13;
and consumables for the existing equipment for one year; and (iii) maintenance of the existing equipment&#13;
for three years. The Project will include equipment for radiology, hematology, microbiology, clinical&#13;
chemistry, anesthesia, surgery, diagnostic and therapeutic obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine&#13;
and neonatal intensive care units. Specific lists of planned investments in each of the hospitals and the&#13;
Institute of Public Health are shown in Appendices 7 and 8.&#13;
Upgrading of clinical skills and practices component&#13;
64.     In order to achieve sustained improvements in the quality of health services provided in the&#13;
hospitals, diagnostic and therapeutic practices must be systematically upgraded. It is recognized that&#13;
structural improvements (civil works, equipment and supplies) are necessary but not sufficient to achieve&#13;
improved quality of care. Furthermore, poor quality of care results in inappropriate diagnoses and&#13;
avoidable complications, with associated costs of remedying conditions that could have been avoided&#13;
had the initial care been of good quality. For these clinical and economic reasons, the Project will&#13;
support the following: (i) the adaptation, production and dissemination of diagnostic and therapeutic&#13;
protocols for essential clinical interventions of known cost-effectiveness; and (ii) in-service training for&#13;
physicians, nurses, midwives, and diagnostic and laboratory technologists.&#13;
65.     The activities to be supported by the Project will be organized around a Continuous Medical&#13;
Education Center (CME), to be established in the medical library of the Clinical Center in Banja Luka. It&#13;
will start with basic skills and progressively cover more specialized fields of medicine.&#13;
66.     Civil Works. Equipment and Supplies. The Project will provide civil works for rehabilitation&#13;
and/or remodelling of seminar rooms, furniture, audio-visual equipment, books, and journals for the&#13;
hospitals and the Institute of Public Health. Audio-visual equipment will include slide projectors,&#13;
overhead projectors, computer workstations and Local Area Network (LAN) with CD-ROMs, desktop&#13;
publishing software and equipment for multi-media presentation. The CME will be provided with a core&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
set of relevant medical journals. Basic textbooks and audio-visual materials will be supplied to each&#13;
hospital.&#13;
67.    Personnel and Training. The Project will support the development and implementation of in-&#13;
service local training for doctors, nurses, midwives and diagnostic and laboratory technicians.&#13;
Specifically, the Project will support: (a) the establishment and functioning of a Clinical Skills&#13;
Development Group; (b) the adaptation, production and dissemination of diagnostic and therapeutic&#13;
protocols for essential clinical interventions of known cost-effectiveness; and (c) in-service training&#13;
within each hospital, focusing on the development of skills required for the diagnoses and treatment of&#13;
the most common clinical conditions. The approach will be to cover all practicing professionals --&#13;
doctors, nurses, technicians -- throughout the Project.&#13;
Health financing reform component&#13;
68.      The Health Finance Reform Component in the RS will be undertaken in co-ordination with&#13;
that of the Federation as described in the Detailed Project Description for the Federation and in the&#13;
Terms of Reference, attached as an appendix. Cost tables of specific project inputs are shown separately&#13;
for each entity in the appendices.&#13;
Project Implementation Support Component&#13;
69.      Given the tight fiscal position of BH during initial period of recovery from the war, support&#13;
will be sought to cover all required foreign and local costs of Project management. This will include all&#13;
needed investments (office equipment, technical assistance and training), as well as incremental&#13;
recurrent expenditures for three years of operation. Since the required management capacity is currently&#13;
not available in the RS MOH, an effective Project Implementation Unit will be created within the MOH.&#13;
70.     The PIU will consist of a Project Director to manage and co-ordinate the implementation of the&#13;
Project; a Procurement Specialist to supervise tendering, purchasing and delivery of goods; an&#13;
Accountant to maintain Project financial records; an Architect/Construction Engineer to co-ordinate and&#13;
supervise civil works activities; and the needed administrative support staff, secretaries and translators.&#13;
This core staff will constitute the PIU "Technical Team", which will establish linkages between the RS&#13;
MOH and the municipalities to ensure the timely implementation of the Project. This approach will be&#13;
fully integrated with -- and strengthen -- the emerging administrative structure and management capacity&#13;
of the MOH. A team of experts, comprised of members of working groups who designed the Project,&#13;
will constitute the "Essential Hospital Services Steering Committee". The PIU will liaise with the Donor&#13;
Coordination Office to be established by the MOH, in order to provide accurate information about the&#13;
status of overall Project financing and needs to the donor community (see Financing Plan below).&#13;
71.     The estimated total cost of the RS part of the Project is US$11.5 million equivalent, including&#13;
physical contingencies of three percent on goods, technical assistance, training and recurrent costs, and&#13;
seven percent on civil works. Price contingencies of 2.3 percent have been included. Investment costs&#13;
(US$8.4 million) covering civil works, medical equipment, vehicles, technical assistance and training&#13;
constitute 76 percent of the total project costs. Recurrent costs (US$3.0 million) including medical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
supplies, operation and maintenance of vehicles, as well as other operating costs, constitute 24 percent of&#13;
the total project cost. Detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix 3 (RS). They are net of taxes.&#13;
Project Financing Plan&#13;
72.     Financing Plan. Bosnia and Herzegovina will be the recipient of the funds to be provided by&#13;
various donors. The government of Italy has committed US$5.2 million (eight billion Italian Lire), and&#13;
the governments of Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom have expressed interest in&#13;
financing parts of the Project. These expressions of interest are being followed up and additional&#13;
possibilities are being sought. In this regard, the RS MOH will take the lead to secure the funds required&#13;
for the Project. In July 1996, a Bank mission assisted the RS MOH to prepare the work plan of a donor&#13;
coordination office that is intended to secure funds for the Project and for the broader Program. If the&#13;
needed co-financing were not available for any reason, the Project scope will be reduced to fit within the&#13;
available funds, with priority given to those components to be financed through IDA (see Table 6:&#13;
Financing Plan below). Such a reduction will not in any case reduce the viability of the Project, since the&#13;
design was based on functional sub-units within the Project, since the design was based on functional&#13;
sub-units within the Project, and the IDA(ITF)-financed components were based on the indispensable&#13;
core priorities for restoring essential hospital services.&#13;

F. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
73.   The World Bank is supporting the MOH of each entity to undertake the health reform and&#13;
reconstruction program. The Bank has provided assistance to the working groups of the MOHs in&#13;
preparing a sound government program, based on explicit priorities and within projected capacity for&#13;
sustainability in BH. IDA(ITF) and other donors will finance modules of this Program as "projects",&#13;
and/or combine to finance the entire Program. Subsequent references to "projects" are to be interpreted&#13;
in this context. This section describes in detail the implementation arrangements for the Essential&#13;
Hospital Services Project, which will provide support to the reform of hospital services in BH. This&#13;
Project will be implemented by the Federation MOH and the RS MOH in close coordination and&#13;
collaboration with the related health authorities at the local level: cantons, municipalities, universities,&#13;
NGOs and other volunteer and donor agencies.&#13;
74.   To undertake its Health Reform and Reconstruction Program, the MOH has established an&#13;
Executive Office, under the direct authority of the Minister and Deputy Minister, with two main&#13;
responsibilities: (i) design and implementation of the health sector recovery program; and (ii)&#13;
coordination of donor activities. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been created to coordinate&#13;
and manage the War Victims Rehabilitation (WVR) Project under the authority of the MOH Executive&#13;
Office. It is envisaged that a PIU, with its own Director appointed by the MOH will be created to&#13;
coordinate and manage the Essential Hospital Services (EHS) Project. For some of the technical&#13;
functions (e.g., procurement), the EHS-PIU will use the existing resources of the WVR-PIU as much as&#13;
possible to create economies of scale. The two PIU Directors will work under the overall supervision&#13;
and guidance of the Executive Office of the Federation PIU and the RS MOH. Each PIU will represent&#13;
another building block in developing an operationally effective MOH in each entity, as is true of the&#13;
WVR Project's PIU in the Federation.&#13;
75.   Each PIU will have the responsibility for: (i) day-to-day management, coordination and&#13;
monitoring of the Project's activities; (ii) coordination of all other activities in the field of health reforms&#13;
and restructuring and strengthening of hospital services being supported by other donor agencies in&#13;
connection with this Project and (iii) coordination with and integration of activities (as required) under&#13;
the WVR Project.&#13;
76.   Similar to the implementation arrangements for the WVR Project, a core Technical Team will be&#13;
recruited and will be responsible for all project implementation activities: civil works, procurement,&#13;
accounting, etc. In addition, three policy development advisory teams -- Essential Hospital Services&#13;
Steering Committee, Clinical Skills Development Group, and Health Financing Steering Committee --&#13;
will be established from the working groups which prepared the project proposals. These groups will be&#13;
employed on a part-time basis (i.e., approximately 20 days/year) and will provide professional guidance&#13;
and technical expertise to each PIU in the further development and implementation of project activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
77.    Since the Project activities will take place in selected hospitals, the Federation Health Insurance&#13;
Agency (FHIA) offices in the cantons, the RS Public Health Fund and its branch offices, each PIU/MOH&#13;
and cantonal administrations need to agree on operational and administrative procedures prior to&#13;
implementation. 6 As ownership, participation and commitment of the local health authorities are critical&#13;
for the successful implementation of the project, much attention will be given to this process. The&#13;
objective will be to reach a "contractual agreement" between local authorities and the MOHs, under&#13;
which the local authorities commit to undertake the activities agreed upon and the MOHs (through the&#13;
PIUs) will provide the needed resources to implement the said activities. Such a "contractual agreement"&#13;
does not in any way function as an on-lending instrument: all resources will remain under the control of&#13;
the PIUs which will make them available to local authorities according to the implementation schedule.&#13;
The implementation arrangements for major activity areas are given below.&#13;
Implementation of the Physical Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Hospital Facilities Component.&#13;
78.    Responsibility for the implementation of this component will rest with each MOH/PIU in&#13;
coordination with the hospital and local health authorities. The PIUs will be responsible for ensuring the&#13;
provision and coordination of necessary inputs.&#13;
79.    The activities under this component cover mainly physical rehabilitation of existing hospital&#13;
facilities. Given the limited implementation capacity of the MOHs, technical assistance will be needed&#13;
to support the PIUs in: (i) assessing the needs for rehabilitation of hospitals, (ii) preparing civil works&#13;
design and tender documents; (iii) carrying out of tendering and selection procedures; and (iv)&#13;
supervising civil works. Technical assistance (TA) support will be provided through the Project for this&#13;
purpose. The TA agency to undertake this assignment should have extensive prior experience in the&#13;
required functions, as well as the technical and logistics capacity to supervise effectively the civil works&#13;
activities in all the cantons.&#13;
80.    The PIUs will be responsible for approving all documentation prepared by this TA agency and&#13;
for authorizing payments based on the reports and invoices received regularly from the contractors&#13;
through this agency. A procedure for effective communication needs to be established between the PIUs&#13;
and the TA agency.&#13;
Implementation of the Medical Equipment and Supplies Component&#13;
81.   Responsibility for the implementation of this component will rest with each PIU in coordination&#13;
with the hospital and local health authorities. The PIUs will be responsible for ensuring the provision&#13;
and coordination of necessary inputs. Since the type and quantity of the equipment and supplies to be&#13;
procured for each hospital will be determined by the level of service to be provided by each hospital, the&#13;
activities of this component should be consistent with the Physical Rehabilitation and Reconstruction&#13;
6      Legislation for establishment of an autonomous Federation Health Insurance Agency (and Fund) is&#13;
expected to be approved by Parliament within the next few months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Component of the Project. Specifically, investments must result in functional facilities that provide good&#13;
quality services.&#13;
82.    The procurement of medical equipment and supplies will be handled by a specialized&#13;
Procurement Agent (PA) -- with the capacity to prepare the required technical specifications and to&#13;
procure the equipment and supplies -- to be contracted following a competitive process. The PA will be&#13;
responsible for: (i) the preparation of technical specifications and tendering documents; (ii) carrying out&#13;
tendering procedures and development of evaluation and selection criteria; and (iii) evaluation of&#13;
proposals on behalf of and in coordination with the PlUs/MOHs. The PA will also be responsible for&#13;
inspecting the delivery and installation of the equipment, certifying payments in accordance with&#13;
contract conditions and supervising the in-service training programs to be provided by the suppliers&#13;
authorized by the PIUs.&#13;
Implementation of the Clinical Skills and Practices Component&#13;
83.   In the Federation, this component will be implemented by the 3 clinical centers and 8 cantonal&#13;
hospitals with technical assistance provided for the development and implementation of training courses.&#13;
In RS, this component will be implemented by the Banja Luka clinical center and Project-supported&#13;
hospitals.&#13;
84.    A Clinical Skills Development Group comprised of 5 senior medical and nursing professionals&#13;
will be established by the MOHs. This group will be responsible for (i) adapting and supervision the&#13;
production and dissemination of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols for essential clinical interventions&#13;
of known cost-effectiveness; and (ii) the provision of in-service training for designated hospital staff.&#13;
85.    The Clinical Skills Development Group will be responsible for the implementation of in-services&#13;
training programs. For this purpose, workshops will be organized for staff groups, comprising doctors,&#13;
nurses, midwives and diagnostic and laboratory technologists from each hospital periodically during&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
86.    Allocation of the appropriate space for training in each project hospital should be secured during&#13;
the project design phase of the first component. The Project will provide furniture, office and audio-&#13;
visual equipment, and library resources.&#13;
Implementation of the Health Finance Reform Component:&#13;
87.    The Health Finance Reform component will be implemented by each MOH/PIU in coordination&#13;
with: (a) the Federation Health Insurance Agency (FHIA) and the cantonal Health Insurance Funds in the&#13;
Federation --these are expected to be established within the next few months - and (b) in coordination&#13;
with the Public Health Fund and its branch offices in RS. Implementation arrangements and&#13;
responsibilities for the two major activity areas under this component are described below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Development of a New Health Financing System&#13;
88.   The MOHs will be responsible for the development of a policy framework for the new health&#13;
financing system and an automation strategy in support of the health insurance offices throughout the&#13;
country. The cantons will further develop the procedures to be implemented in their territory within this&#13;
policy framework. The PIUs will be responsible for ensuring the provision and coordination of&#13;
identified Project inputs for the development and implementation of the new system. The Project will&#13;
provide: (i) technical assistance, (ii) overseas and local training, and (iii) provision of IT equipment and&#13;
supplies.&#13;
89.    The Working Group established for the preparation of the Project proposal will be sustained&#13;
(with amended membership as appropriate) as the Health Financing Steering Committee and supported&#13;
by the Project funds. This committee will work closely with and supervise the system development and&#13;
implementation activities to be carried out under the Project.&#13;
90.   The major technical assistance required for the institutional framework for health insurance,&#13;
basic health package, records and economic analysis in the MOHs will be provided under one package of&#13;
TA comprised of international and local inputs. A Health Finance Adviser will be provided under the&#13;
TA package, to assist the MOHs during the process of system development and early implementation.&#13;
91.    During implementation, MOHs and health insurance staff will receive in-service training to&#13;
develop skills on administrative aspects of the new system. Later in project implementation, overseas&#13;
study tours will be provided to give staff the opportunity to learn from similar health insurance systems&#13;
in Europe.&#13;
Simplified Automated Information System&#13;
92.    The Project will support initial aspects of the development of a simplified management&#13;
information system to link financial and service delivery information at the Federation and cantonal&#13;
levels . The Federation will have certain statutory requirements for data, and the project will support the&#13;
development of a unified information system for all health insurance offices at the Federation and&#13;
cantonal levels. The Federation may need to contract out collection and processing of data. In RS,&#13;
emphasis will be on enhancing efficiency and use of information for decision making, and on improved&#13;
communications among the Public Health Fund and its branch offices.&#13;
93.    The Project will also finance both international and local TA to support the information system&#13;
establishment. Information system specialists will be hired to coordinate all activities associated with&#13;
development of the information system. Training will also be provided for health insurance staff in both&#13;
entities to upgrade their technical skills in the implementation of the health insurance systems.&#13;
94.    The IT equipment, mainly computer terminals, modems, printers, and facsimile for FHIA and RS&#13;
Public Health Fund offices, will be procured through LIB in the first year of the Project. The preparation&#13;
of technical specifications, and the tendering process will be handled by the Procurement Agent to be&#13;
recruited as described above. Funds are allocated for this purpose under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
Project Implementation Schedule&#13;
95.   The Project will be implemented over a three year period. To allow for swift implementation of&#13;
this emergency-type operation, procedures for project implementation will be kept simple to the extent&#13;
possible. To secure the timely implementation of the Project, implementation schedules have been&#13;
developed for each component (Appendix 5 for the Federation, Appendix 10 for RS).&#13;
96.   A joint Project Launch Workshop will be organized by the PlUs, with the support of the Bank's&#13;
Social Sector Operations Officer in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition to the authorities of the MOHs&#13;
and the PlUs, this workshop will involve all responsible staff at the national and cantonal levels and&#13;
responsible staff in the health facilities supported under the Project. The purpose of the workshop will be&#13;
to: (i) review the project concept and activities; (ii) confirm the role and responsibilities of each level of&#13;
authority and implementation; (iii) confirm the functional standards determined by the Professional&#13;
Team for the selected hospitals; and (iv) finalize and agree on the implementation schedule.&#13;
97. Within 30 days following the Project Launch Workshop, a Procurement Workshop and a&#13;
Disbursement Workshop involving all persons involved in procurement, including The. PIUs, the&#13;
Procurement Agent and the members of the Procurement Review Committee, will be organized by the&#13;
PIUs to review, explain and assign responsibilities for the procurement procedures set for the Project.&#13;

contract; direct contracting (aggregate Federation: US$120,000-RS: US$300,000) for books, intellectual property, spare parts.&#13;
Procurement of Goods&#13;
100.    Advertising. A General Procurement Notice (GPN, see Appendix) appeared in the October 1996&#13;
issue of the Development Business publication. The notice includes information about the nature of the&#13;
goods, works and services to be procured and invite interested and eligible suppliers, contractors and&#13;
consultants to send their expression of interest to the PIUs. The GPN will also be published in the local&#13;
press.&#13;
101.    Limited International Bidding (LIB). LIB will be used for procurement packages estimated to&#13;
cost between US$2.0 million and US$5.0 million each. Exceptions to the US$2.0 million threshold will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 3 -&#13;
be in cases where there will be only a limited number of suppliers. Medical and office equipment (about&#13;
US$13.4 million total) will be packaged according to related specialized fields. It is likely that LIB will&#13;
be used for the two large medical equipment packages, one for the Federation and one for RS. For the&#13;
Federation, goods not to exceed aggregate of US$2.0 million will be procured. For the RS, goods not to&#13;
exceed an aggregate of US$3.5 million will be procured. As presented in Appendices 4 and 9, it is&#13;
expected that all the remainder of the packages will be under the US$2.0 million threshold, and therefore&#13;
will be procured through International or National Shopping (IS, NS) or Direct Contracting (DC) (see&#13;
below).&#13;
(a) List of LIB Bidders. The list of suppliers will be compiled based on the expressions of&#13;
interest received in response to the General Procurement Notice as well as other sources, such as the&#13;
Procurement Agent's own experience. The list will be as broad as possible. List of suppliers for LIB&#13;
packages will be subject to the Bank's prior approval.&#13;
(b) Bidding Documents for LIB. The Bank's Standard Bidding documents will be used for all&#13;
LIB packages.&#13;
102.  International Shopping (IS). Procedures for IS will be used for equipment and materials or&#13;
standard specification commodities estimated to cost between US$200,000 and US$ 2.0 million per&#13;
contract, not to exceed an aggregate of US$5.5 million for the Federation, and US$1.47 million for RS.&#13;
IS will be based on comparing price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers from two eligible&#13;
countries in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
103.  National Shopping (NS). NS will be used for contracts for goods available in Bosnia&#13;
Herzegovina up to an estimated cost US$ 200,000 per contract with at least three quotations. The&#13;
aggregates will be US$280,000 for the Federation and US$210,000 for RS.&#13;
104.  Direct Contracting (DC). DC will be used for proprietary items, for reasons of compatibility&#13;
and standardization, and in any other justified case. Any direct contracting during project&#13;
implementation will need prior Bank approval. Aggregate for Direct Contracting will be: US$120,000&#13;
for Federation and US$300,000 for RS.&#13;
Procurement of Works&#13;
105.  National Competitive Bidding (NCB) Given the dispersed nature of works and lack of interest&#13;
from foreign contractors, National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures are proposed for contracts&#13;
between US$1 million and US$5 million per contract. However, interested foreign bidders will be&#13;
allowed to participate in NCB. A general pre-qualification of contractors will be carried out, with pre-&#13;
qualification criteria approved by the Bank. Bidding documents will be sent to contractors who will be&#13;
allowed four weeks to submit bids. It is anticipated that three contracts for the Federation, with&#13;
aggregate of US$6.4 million, will be handled using NCB procedures.&#13;
106.  Given the nature of the works, mainly rehabilitation of existing facilities, National Shopping&#13;
(NS) procedures will be used for contracts estimated to cost up to US$ 1.0 million per contract. These&#13;
works will be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
obtained from three qualified contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include&#13;
a detailed description of works, including basic specifications, the required completion period, a basic&#13;
form of agreement acceptable to the Association and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award&#13;
shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work and who has&#13;
the experience and resources to successfully complete the contract. It is estimated that eight contracts for&#13;
the Federation with aggregate of US$6.4 million will be handled using these procedures. For RS, three&#13;
contracts, estimated at US$1.4 million, will be under these procedures.&#13;
Procurement of Services&#13;
107.  Services will be procured through competition and sole sourcing where and when appropriate.&#13;
Qualified firms will be invited to submit proposals for comprehensive packages of consultant services&#13;
and management of fellowships and training in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981).&#13;
To keep the evaluation process manageable, no more than six (but at least three) proposals will be invited&#13;
following a short listing acceptable to the Bank. It is anticipated that the bulk of the technical assistance&#13;
will be procured in ten packages (six for the Federation and four for RS) at a cost of about US$3.7&#13;
million. These assignments will be filled through a competitive process, using short-listing. A small&#13;
amount of technical assistance will also be provided through sole sourcing of the services of the&#13;
respective MOH Steering Committees in the Federation and RS. In addition, some individual training&#13;
will be provided for PIU staff. (See Appendices 4 and 9 for details of procurement packages.)&#13;
108.  The respective PIUs to be established in the Federation-MOH and the RS-MOH will be&#13;
responsible for implementation of the procurement plan. In both PIUs, a procurement officer will be&#13;
appointed to handle procurement matters. These two individuals will receive initial procurement training&#13;
through participation in the procurement seminars to be organized by the Bank in late October 1996, both&#13;
in the Federation and in the Republika Srpska, and will have further periodic training by the Bank over&#13;
the course of the project. In addition, funding will be provided within the project for procurement&#13;
advisory support to facilitate procurement arrangements, and to provide guidance to the procurement&#13;
officers, as needed. The PIUs will be required to coordinate with the independent Procurement&#13;
Monitoring and Audit Unit which has been established under the Emergency Electric Power&#13;
Rehabilitation Project for all projects in Bosnia to ensure the integrity of the procurement process.&#13;
109.  Recurrent cost/Incremental operating expenditures will be procured as follows: PIU staffing&#13;
will be procured through procurement procedures for consultant services and in some cases on a sole-&#13;
source basis, after consultation with IDA. Office supplies, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, rental and&#13;
other services will be procured through National Shopping (NS) or Intemational Shopping (IS),&#13;
according to the availability of required items in Bosnia Herzegovina and the size of the procurement&#13;
packages, and will follow the provisions set for NS and IS in paras. 102 and 103. Gas and electricity will&#13;
be procured from local companies at prevailing rates.&#13;
Prior and Post Bank Review of Procurement Documents&#13;
110.  The Bank has prepared the invitation to quote and contract documents for International&#13;
Shopping, National Competitive Bidding and a national shopping document for civil works. These&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
documents will be used under the Project. Prior review will be required for all contracts procured&#13;
through Limited International Bidding (LIB) and Direct Contracting (DC). Also, the first three NCB&#13;
contracts for works will require prior review from IDA. For consultants' contracts, prior review will be&#13;
required for: (i) all consultants' terns of reference; (ii) contracts above US$100,000 for firms; (iii)&#13;
contracts above US$50,000 for individuals; and (iv) all sole source contracts. The Bank's standard form&#13;
of consultant contracts will be used. Post review of procurement actions on a sample basis will be&#13;
carried out during supervision missions.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
111.   Disbursement categories and projected disbursements under the Credit are shown in Table 8&#13;
below. The Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of three years from Date of Effectiveness,&#13;
scheduled for November 29, 1996. The closing date will be June 30, 2000.&#13;

112.   Special Accounts. To facilitate timely project implementation, payments for agreed project&#13;
activities are to be made from two Special Accounts in US dollars which are to be established and&#13;
maintained by the State Ministry of Finance at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The authorized&#13;
allocations of the Special Accounts will be limited to US$2.0 million for the Federation, and US$ 1.0&#13;
million for RS. Replenishment applications should be submitted on a monthly basis or more frequently&#13;
if the amount withdrawn is approximately one-third of the amount on deposit. The Bank will accept&#13;
applications for direct payment outside of the Special Accounts that exceeded 20% of the authorized&#13;
allocations. PIU Directors and their designees will have the authority to operate these accounts in line&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
with sound principles of accountability and responsibility for use under the project.&#13;
113.   Statements of Expenditures. Disbursements will be made against Statements of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs) for contracts for: goods less than US$2 million equivalent, works less than US$5 million&#13;
equivalent, except for the first three contracts awarded under Schedule 3, Section 1, Part B.3, consulting&#13;
firms less than US$100,000 equivalent, individual consultants less than US$50,000 equivalent, and all&#13;
training and incremental operating expenditures. The documentation for SOE expenditures will be&#13;
reviewed by the PIUs and made available for the required audit as well as for Bank supervision missions.&#13;
Full documentation will be required for all contracts above these limits.&#13;
Accounts, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
114.  Accounts. Separate and auditable accounts on the Project will be established by each PIU.&#13;
These accounts will include: (i) a record of withdrawals with copies of all disbursement requests and&#13;
underlying documentation; and (ii) a record of transactions on the Special Account and copies of the&#13;
bank statements on this account.&#13;
115.  Audits. The project accounts will be audited annually by independent auditors and under terms&#13;
of reference acceptable to IDA. Separate audit statements will be prepared for the Special Account and&#13;
for Statements of Expenditures. All audit reports will be made available to IDA, at the latest, six months&#13;
after the end of the fiscal year. Project accounts will be maintained for one year after they have been&#13;
audited.&#13;
116.  Reporting. Each PIU will prepare and fumish to IDA a quarterly progress report showing the&#13;
status of implementation, including procurement, of the Project as well as a financial report in a format&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The PIUs will collect data from the canton and branch administrations which will&#13;
compile short quarterly progress reports.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
117.   Project implementation will incorporate an appropriate degree of flexibility in order to adapt&#13;
local implementation arrangements to the rapidly changing circumstances in the country.&#13;
Implementation progress will be formally evaluated at mid-term, i.e., approximately 18 months after&#13;
Project Effectiveness. In addition, during the first 6 to 12 months of implementation, IDA's management&#13;
team for the Project (EC 1/2HR staff in Washington and Budapest), jointly with the Social Sectors&#13;
Operations Officer of the Bank's Resident Mission in Sarajevo, will supervise on a continuous basis all&#13;
initial project implementation steps, and will assist closely on matters requiring advice and rapid&#13;
decision by IDA. In particular, procurement and disbursements will require intensive supervision, given&#13;
the flexibility built into implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Agreements Reached&#13;
118.  In addition to the standard conditions concerning the execution and ratification of the&#13;
Development Credit Agreement, the following actions will be conditions of effectiveness for the&#13;
proposed Credit: (a) execution of a subsidiary agreement between the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, satisfactory to IDA; (b) establishment of a Federation&#13;
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with mandate, staffing and other resources satisfactory to IDA; (c)&#13;
preparation of the detailed list of medical equipment for each cantonal hospital and clinical center in the&#13;
Federation, satisfactory to IDA; and (d) satisfactory allocation of amounts for civil works among specific&#13;
cantonal hospitals and clinical centers to be rehabilitated in the Federation.&#13;
119.  The following action will be a condition of disbursement for that portion of the Credit which is&#13;
allocated to the Federation, namely, preparation of detailed technical specifications and procurement&#13;
packages of medical equipment to be procured under the Project in the Federation, using internationally&#13;
recognized procedures acceptable to IDA. The following actions will be conditions of disbursement for&#13;
that portion of the Credit which is allocated to the Republika Srpska: (a) execution of a subsidiary&#13;
agreement between the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska; (b) establishment of&#13;
an RS PIU with mandate and staffing acceptable to IDA; and (c) preparation of a detailed technical&#13;
specifications and procurement packages of medical equipment to be procured under the Project in the&#13;
Republika Srpska, using internationally recognized procedures acceptable to IDA. If these conditions are&#13;
not met by April 30, 1997, the portions of the Credit concerned could be reallocated or canceled.&#13;
120.  Other agreements reached are: (a) the Federation shall, by February 28, 1997, employ&#13;
procurement agents, under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, to assist the Federation in carrying out&#13;
the procurement of goods and works under the Project and (b) the Republika Srpska shall, by February&#13;
28, 1997, employ procurement agents, under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, to assist the&#13;
Republika Srpska in carrying out the procurement of goods and works under the Project. The Federation&#13;
and Republika Srpska shall each: (a) by May 31, 1997, employ consultants, under terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, to carry out a study on alternatives for the reform of the financing of their respective&#13;
health sectors; (b) by May 31, 1998, carry out each said study; (c) coordinate on the findings of the&#13;
respective studies; and (d) furnish to IDA, for review and comment, the conclusions and&#13;
recommendations of the respective studies, and advise IDA of the reform measures that the Federation&#13;
and Republika Srpska intend to make in the financing of their respective health sectors.&#13;

G. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Project Justification and Benefits&#13;
121.    As a part of the comprehensive Program for the hospital sector, which was prepared within the&#13;
overall post-war health system reconstruction and development program of the Government, the Project&#13;
will contribute to the successful reconstruction and reform of the health sector by (a) restoring basic&#13;
hospital services, and (b) establishing a sustainable health system through carefully planned health&#13;
finance reforms. This section presents: (a) the policy context; (b) an overview of the cost attached to&#13;
alternative approaches to the proposed strategy for recovery in the hospital sub-sector; and (c) the&#13;
estimated contribution of this Project to the health status of the population.&#13;
122.    The policy environment and linkage to economic and sector work. The Project is consistent&#13;
with the focus of the post-war recovery in Bosnia and Herzegovina and with the Health Program of the&#13;
Ministry of Health in each entity. The country faces three major challenges. First, the reconstruction&#13;
and recovery program necessitated by the war damage has to be implemented. Second, new governance&#13;
structures and institutions for economic management must be established. Finally, the transition to a&#13;
market economy must be managed successfully.7 The Project fits into this policy environment in two&#13;
ways. First, it will result in a net inflow of resources into the health sector. The broader Essential&#13;
Hospital Services Program provides the donor community with a framework for investment to support&#13;
the recovery of the health sector. For example, the Governments of Canada, Greece, Hungary, Italy,&#13;
Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, as well as the United States Agency for International Development,&#13;
have expressed interests in the sub-sector. Second, the Project will facilitate the development of&#13;
management structures and systems to ensure effective risk pooling, improved efficiency and cost&#13;
control .&#13;
123.    No formal sector work was done prior to the appraisal of this Project, due to the severity and&#13;
urgency of post-war needs, the rapid pace of work in BH and the very limited availability of organised&#13;
databases. Instead, for each of the main components of the Project -- rehabilitation/ renovation, medical&#13;
equipment and health finance reforms -- the Working Group of each MOH, the International&#13;
Management Group (IMG), Bank staff and consultants conducted the minimum necessary analyses to&#13;
make informed judgements about investment priorities. These analyses of limited scope were done with&#13;
a focus on: (a) the needs expressed by the Ministry of Health of each entity; (b) prospects for&#13;
sustainability, based upon projected rates of economic growth and expected levels of expenditure in the&#13;
health sector; (c) the minimum level of investments to ensure that secondary-level hospital services of&#13;
good quality will be available to support the functions of a reformed primary health care/ sub-hospital&#13;
level; and d) the need to avoid uncoordinated large-scale investments in the hospital sub-sector, thereby&#13;
avoiding a situation whereby future recurrent costs will starve the sub-hospital level of needed resources.&#13;
These are presented in detail in the appendices.&#13;
124.    Alternative approaches and their costs: There would have been basically two broad&#13;
alternatives to the proposed Essential Hospital Services Program of each entity (of which the proposed&#13;
The World Bank. Bosnia and Herzegovina: Toward Economic Recovery. Prepared by the World Bank, the&#13;
European Commission and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Project is a sub-set of the highest priority investments). The first scenario, and the appropriate&#13;
counterfactual in any economic analysis of the proposed Project, would have been to have no Bank&#13;
involvement in the hospital sub-sector at all. In this scenario, there would have been little or no&#13;
articulation of priorities, and both Government and donor investments would be made on an ad-hoc&#13;
basis. It is most likely that, considering the current climate of donor fund shortages, without the explicit&#13;
priorities set forth in the Program and the proposed Project, donors would focus on high-visibility&#13;
tertiary-level equipment and civil works, to the detriment of much needed investments in cantonal&#13;
hospitals. The end result would have been poor coordination of donor assistance, unnecessary increase&#13;
in unit costs, waste and increased waste and inequity.&#13;
125.     The second scenario would have consisted of a "wholesale" reconstruction of the hospital sub-&#13;
sector, without introducing the basis for ensuring minimal sustainability. In the Federation, for example,&#13;
this approach would have resulted in the restoration of the pre-war hospital bed capacity of 10,296,&#13;
whereas the entire Program plans to restore a capacity of 8,476, a reduction of almost 20 percent. The&#13;
Project, by comparison, will impact on only 50 percent of this reduced number. This wholesale&#13;
reconstruction alternative, together with the rehabilitation of facilities, would have also restored all the&#13;
inefficiencies of the pre-war system: poorly maintained structures and insufficient recurrent operational&#13;
funds to ensure that the hospital system functions adequately. Although difficult to quantify, the&#13;
proposed Project strongly reduces the risks of reconstructing highly under-financed hospital services in&#13;
the near future.&#13;
126.   Direct Economic Benefits: The project investments in the hospital sector will restore to fully&#13;
functional status a restricted number of beds in secondary hospital facilities and will support them with&#13;
carefully chosen equipment (see Appendices on Hospital Equipment and Supplies for methodological&#13;
details). The chosen process was designed to include only equipment that (a) has been demonstrated to&#13;
be both clinically effective and cost-effective and (b) in total, will generate recurrent financial costs that&#13;
could be sustained within the projected financial capacity of the hospital&#13;
127.   This Project supports an overall strategy to bring about more cost-effective use of resources&#13;
committed to the health sector. The benefits of reallocating resources to more effective uses can take&#13;
two forms. One is lower costs to achieve the same impact that current health services have on health&#13;
outcomes and health status. The other form is a heightened impact on health outcomes and health status&#13;
for the same level of resource use. In practice, the benefits of health reform are likely to take both forms.&#13;
128.   However, many of the Project's benefits -- particularly those associated with health-sector&#13;
reform -- cannot be accurately quantified. Nevertheless, their potential order of magnitude is substantial,&#13;
as two indicative calculations suggest. First, the health sector is likely to absorb at least 4 percent of&#13;
GDP in the medium term. If health reform increases the efficiency with which the sector uses resources&#13;
by even 5 percent, this will translate into a stream of productivity gains equivalent to 0.2 percent of GDP&#13;
per year.&#13;
129.   Indirect Economic Benefits: Over and above these direct economic benefits, there are indirect&#13;
benefits. When health systems succeed in keeping people healthier or deliver more effective curative&#13;
care, the population can lead more productive lives. Workers produce more because they spend less time&#13;
recuperating from their own illnesses or caring for family members who are sick; students learn more;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
and some people avoid the enduring ill-effects that certain illnesses bring. In short, human capital is&#13;
preserved and quality of life is enhanced.&#13;
130.    In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a functioning, reforming health sector that is sustainable should&#13;
also bring other intangible but important benefits. The strategy for nation-building and for promoting&#13;
lasting peace rests on recreating viable, valued systems for meeting people's basic needs. Access to&#13;
effective health services is a high priority in this context -- a credible peace dividend.&#13;
131.    Improvement of Health Status. The estimated total number of disability-adjusted life years&#13;
(DALYs) lost in the Formerly Socialist Economies of Europe in 1990 was 57,779,000. Of this total, 8.6&#13;
percent were due to communicable, maternal and peri-natal causes, 74.5 percent were due to non-&#13;
communicable (neoplastic nutritional/ endocrine, neuro-psychiatric, cardiovascular, respiratory,&#13;
digestive, genito-urinary, musculo-skeletal, congenital and oral), and 16.9 percent were due to injuries. 8&#13;
Assuming the same distribution of DALYs lost for Bosnia and Herzegovina prior to the war, this&#13;
distribution has probably been altered by the high incidence and prevalence of injuries during the war.&#13;
Many of the needs for physical and psycho-social rehabilitation are being addressed by, among others,&#13;
the Bank-supported War Victims Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
132.    The proposed Essential Hospital Services Project, together with planned investments in&#13;
primary health care, will provide the basis for sustainable gains in the health status of the population in&#13;
the medium term by restoring the most necessary secondary-level services and by serving as a vehicle for&#13;
reforming the financing of the health sector with a focus on universal risk pooling and efficiency . The&#13;
restoration of good quality care will eliminate the avoidable costs of treating complications arising from&#13;
inappropriate diagnoses and treatments.&#13;

Project risks&#13;
133.    Limited implementation capacity could delay the implementation of the proposed Project.&#13;
This risk will be mitigated by the establishment of a Project Implementation Unit in each entity, that will&#13;
build on the resources and experience of the PIU which has been developed and is operational for the&#13;
War Victims Rehabilitation Project in the Federation. Each PIU will be supported by appropriate&#13;
technical assistance and by the Bank's Social Sector Operations Officer, based in Sarajevo. Project&#13;
implementation could also be delayed through shortages of co-financing. This risk is being mitigated by&#13;
active communication among the Ministry of Health in each entity, the Bank and likely donors.&#13;
134.    Significant risks within the Project, for the most part, are associated with: (i) political context&#13;
of and constraints on the definition of health sector policy; (ii) financial constraints on Project size,&#13;
including limited availability of IDA funds and co-financing; (iii) current state of post-war disruption&#13;
and evolving reconciliation within the country; and (iv) pressures for early action to improve health&#13;
service delivery within BH, which may not consider the most effective and sustainable approaches to&#13;
restructuring the health sector.&#13;
135.    One major set of risks is associated with the Federation Government's present commitment to&#13;
a policy of making cantonal governments responsible for most aspects of health policy, financing and&#13;
administration, possibly within a matter of months. Several factors underlie that commitment: (i) the&#13;
tradition of substantially decentralized health care within the former Yugoslavia; (ii) consistent with the&#13;
rationale for decentralization, the desire to locate responsibility for health services as close as possible to&#13;
the people affected by them; and (iii) the political impetus to avoid creating health insurance&#13;
arrangements that effectively cross-subsidize health care provision among high- and low-income areas.&#13;
Making cantons responsible for health care financing and delivery will remove from the Federation's&#13;
political stage this politically intractable issue of equity in access to health services. Potentially, the&#13;
Federation Government's commitment to this governance strategy for the health sector could result in up&#13;
to ten separate health care financing and delivery systems with the Federation, in addition to the&#13;
centralized system in RS. In practice however, this risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the&#13;
legislation under preparation opens the possibility for cantons to choose to group together and develop&#13;
coordinated or integrated financing systems. The end result will therefore likely be the emergence of&#13;
two to four separate health financing systems. These groupings will correspond to a considerable degree&#13;
to prior patterns of affiliation among cantons, a translation of the current political reality in BH.&#13;
136.    Other risks, also linked to the Federation Government's commitment to this strategy, could&#13;
result in less than optimal implementation of the Federation MOH reform process. These are: (i) the&#13;
difficulty or inability of the poorest cantons to finance their obligation to provide access to a Federation-&#13;
specified minimum package of care; (ii) the limited capacity of the Federation MOH to exert sufficient&#13;
policy leverage to maintain control over the restructuring of health care delivery and financing systems&#13;
within the various cantons; (iii) the limited capacity of the Federation MOH to turn its health reform&#13;
strategy into an implementable process; (iv) the high administrative cost of managing and operating&#13;
multiple cantonal health care financing and delivery systems for a small population. These costs may&#13;
prove unsustainable in a recovering economy and a still relatively poor country. Counterpart policy&#13;
makers expect that cantonally based health care systems will provide unequal access to care across&#13;
cantons, reflecting the different average levels of income across cantons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
137.  Within the above-mentioned constraints and risks, a number of mitigating factors are also to be&#13;
considered and have been taken into account in Project preparation. First, the pre-war Yugoslav health&#13;
system was among the most sophisticated in Eastern Europe, and it retains health sector personnel with&#13;
the vision, the will and the skills to achieve sustainable transformation of the current war-damaged&#13;
system. In that context and with judicious use of technical assistance, there is a real possibility that&#13;
demonstration of the economies of scale that could be achieved in a simplified, less fragmented system&#13;
will lead to revision of the Federation strategy. Second, the task of reforming health care delivery and&#13;
financing has proven to be highly complex in all other transition economies -- and even in established&#13;
market economies -- which did not face the complex context of post-war BH. Expectations must&#13;
therefore be kept at reasonable levels, with considerable emphasis on productive partnerships among BH,&#13;
IDA and the donors. Third, the Project itself is intended to provide a broad range of technical assistance&#13;
that should enhance and build up the Federation's and Republika Srpska's capacity to design, implement&#13;
and sustain systemic reforms.&#13;

Medical Equipment and Supplies Component&#13;
Background&#13;
Biomedical technology represents a fundamental component of the health care delivery process,&#13;
on which the most of diagnostic, therapeutic and rehabilitation procedures are based. Both in&#13;
industrialized and developing countries, health services in hospitals are largely based on the use of&#13;
technology. As reported in the scientific literature, a close relationship can be found between the per-&#13;
capita GNP and the value of installed medical equipment. In particular, data collected at international&#13;
level -- on a large number of industrialized and developing countries -- show an almost constant ratio&#13;
between these three components:&#13;
- per-capita GNP&#13;
- per-capita health care expenditure&#13;
- per-bed equipment value&#13;
An immediate explanation can be found for justifying these data: medical technology is expensive&#13;
in terms of investment but also in terms of running costs. Therefore, if immediate problems related to&#13;
investments can sometimes be solved by external aid (for countries with insufficient internal resources&#13;
for investments), in the medium- to long-term the running costs must be sustained with internal&#13;
resources. As a result, even in the case of large donations of new and advanced technology (as it&#13;
happened in many developing countries), a mechanism of automatic readjustment takes place in a short&#13;
period of time, whereby only that portion of the externally-funded investment that is sustainable within&#13;
local resources is maintained and able to survive.&#13;
The main reasons for the premature de-commissioning of unsustainable technology can be found in&#13;
the costs for consumable materials and for maintenance that, on average, represent a yearly charge of 30-&#13;
35% of the cost of installed equipment. Unfortunately, running costs incidence is particularly noticeable&#13;
in the two fundamental technological components of diagnostic services: radiology and clinical&#13;
laboratory, which together represent around 50% of the installed equipment in a medium-sized hospital.&#13;
Medical technology for the other diagnostic and therapeutic services must cover the remaining 50%.&#13;
Any attempt to change this ratio (i.e.: trying to reduce consumable costs) will generate an unbalanced&#13;
system unable to support the hospital activity adequately.&#13;
Appraisal of the sustainable level of technology&#13;
An approxinate quantification of the optimal level of medical technology, in terms of correct ratio&#13;
between acceptable level of health services and sustainable costs, can be done on the basis of the&#13;
assumptions reported in Table 1, resulting from analyses carried out in some European countries (M. of&#13;
Health - Italy 1994; MDIS Reports - U.K. 1992).&#13;

Appendix 2, Table 1: Running costs of medical technology&#13;
(as a percentage of the replacement value of installed equipment)&#13;
Cost of consumables:                                            25%&#13;
Cost of external maintenance (manufacturer technical service):   10%&#13;
Cost of internal maintenance (hospital technicians)              5%&#13;
Amortization rate (10 years life-span):                         10%&#13;
TOTAL:                                   40-50%&#13;
Besides, in Europe, the annual market of biomedical tecnology (equipment and consumables)&#13;
represents, on average, less than 5% of the global budget for health care of a country. In the short-&#13;
medium term, in the Federation of BH we can expect that some costs components of health care (i.e.:&#13;
personnel) will be significantly lower than in other European countries. As a consequence, we can&#13;
estimate that the cost of technology will represent a greater component of the health care budget than in&#13;
other countries (up to 10%).&#13;
According to estimates coming from World Bank and from the Federation of BH Ministry of&#13;
Health, the yearly per-capita expenditure for health care should be between 80 and 95 US$ by the year&#13;
2000. Assuming a population of about 3 million inhabitants, it is possible to estimate a global budget for&#13;
health care of about 285 million US$, in the best case. As a consequence, the sustainable allocation of&#13;
funds for biomedical technology (amortization, running costs, materials, etc.) should range from 14 to 28&#13;
million US$ per year.&#13;
On the other side, integrating information coming from different sources (Ministry of Health,&#13;
WHO), it is possible to estimate a global replacement cost of 60 million US$ for the biomedical&#13;
equipment installed in all Federation of BH health care structures. Considering the running cost rates&#13;
previously indicated, corresponding to a total of 40-45% of the installed equipment value, it is possible&#13;
to estimate a medical technlogy running cost of 24 to 27 million US$ per year. This cost is approaching&#13;
the maximum allocation of funds for health technology allowed by the Federation of BH health care&#13;
budget for the year 2000.&#13;
From these data, it is possible to conclude that 60 million US$ represents the maximum amount&#13;
of medical technology sustainable by the Federation of BIH health care system and, as a&#13;
consequence, that all re-equipment plans should not exceed this limit. A reasonable strategy&#13;
would be to recover the 4-year period of total lack of investments, due to war contingencies, in&#13;
order to cover the amortization shares (10% per year) and to preserve the level of obsolescence of&#13;
equipment.  In practical terms, at present about 40%  of existing equipment is eligible for&#13;
replacement with new technology. Besides, the Program is aimed at establishing a permanent&#13;
policy of replacement of obsolete equipment, in order to preserve the value of investments and the&#13;
quality of health care services. As a consequence, assuming a duration of the Program of 3 years&#13;
(1997-1999), a further 40% of investment has been planned to cover the post-war period 1996-&#13;
1999. In particular, in the 11 hospitals covered by the Essential Hospital Services Program, a&#13;
replacement value of installed medical equipment of about 40 million US$ has been estimated.&#13;

In order to assure the full operation of both the existing equipment and the equipment that will&#13;
replace the obsolete one, a financial support covering 50% of consumable costs is projected, assuming&#13;
that the progressive implementation of the health financing mechanism and the progressive increase of&#13;
incomes will allow the coverage, by the end of the project, the full operational costs of installed&#13;
technology.&#13;
Criteria for the identification of priorities&#13;
On the basis of estimates previously reported, a careful assessment has been made in order to identify&#13;
priorities for the replacement of existing equipment. The primary objective of this analysis was the&#13;
identification of equipment configurations able to assure basic diagnostic and therapeutic services at a&#13;
level adequate to the demand and compatible with the economic constraints that will affect the health&#13;
care budget in the next years. The basic issues on which the assessment has been based are:&#13;
-  identification of essential hospital services according to their social and epidemiologic impact;&#13;
-  age of installed equipment;&#13;
-  uniform level of technology between hospital services;&#13;
-  uniform level of technology between hospitals of same level; and&#13;
-  size of hospital and actual size of population served;&#13;
As a result of this assessment, a re-equipment plan has been developed addressing the priorities&#13;
according to the specific situation of each hospital and to the assessment criteria previously indicated&#13;
This medium-term investment plan covers a global period of 3 years (1992 - 1999) and is aimed at&#13;
covering the essential diagnostic and therapeutic services of the 2nd and 3rd level health care structures&#13;
of the Federation. Appendix 2, pages 4 and 5 show the global Program estimates for the Medical&#13;
Equipment and Supplies 3. Appendix 2, page 6 shows that portion of the Program to be covered by this&#13;

Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
Monitoring is the process of assessing the extent to which activities meet or deviate from&#13;
expectations, for the purpose of enabling improvements and corrections during implementation.&#13;
Monitoring would be done by tracking inputs according to component, activity and expenditure&#13;
category, as outlined in the Input Table on page 2 of this appendix.&#13;
Project Evaluation&#13;
Evaluation is the process of assessing the extent to which stated objectives are achieved.&#13;
The Project objectives are to: (i) strengthen essential hospital services, focusing on the most&#13;
needy segments of the population; and (ii) establish and support the initial steps of health finance&#13;
reform. Because the Project by itself would not have immediate measurable impacts on&#13;
aggregate health status, indicators of aggregate health status would be inappropriate --&#13;
conceptually and in practice -- for evaluating the Project. Accordingly, the indicators on page 3&#13;
of this appendix would be used as proxy-indicators for project evaluation. They were selected on&#13;
the basis of relevance to the project objectives, sensitivity to planned activities, ease of data&#13;
collection and parsimony.&#13;

Assessment of global program needs&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The aim of the exercise was to carry out a rapid and sufficiently detailed appraisal of the status of&#13;
biomedical equipment installed in hospitals of medium and high complexity (2nd and 3d level health care&#13;
institutions) to identify the priorities for a medium term program for re-equipping these health institutions.&#13;
It was organized around the following main activities:&#13;
*  Identification of health institutions&#13;
*  Detailed survey of the status of some of these health institutions&#13;
*  Analysis of data and assessment of priorities for new biomedical instrumentation&#13;
*  Development of a medium-term program to re-equip the priority health care institutions&#13;
*  Quantification of costs for equipment, maintenance and consumables.&#13;
The present document was prepared on the basis of information collected in the health institutions&#13;
visited during the mission and of other official documents provided by the Ministry of Health's Working&#13;
Group of the Republika Srpska. It refers to the global Essential Hospital Services Program in RS, of which&#13;
the Essential Hospital Services Project in RS is a part.&#13;
Identification of health institutions&#13;
In cooperation with the MOH Working Group, nine hospitals and two institutes located in RS&#13;
were identified as priority second and third-level health institutions which would form the basis for RS's&#13;
future health care system. The health institutions identified were the following:&#13;
- Clinical Center - Banja Luka&#13;
- Institute of Public Health - Banja Luka&#13;
- General Hospital - Prijedor&#13;
- General Hospital - Gradiska&#13;
- General Hospital - Doboj&#13;
- General Hospital - Bijelina&#13;
- Hospitals of Pale/Kasindol/Sokolac&#13;
- General Hospital - Trebinje&#13;
- General Hospital - Brcko&#13;
- General Hospital - Zvornik&#13;
-  Institute of Physical Rehabilitation - Banja Luka&#13;
The first four institutions (Banja Luka Clinical Center, Institute of Public Health, Prijedor&#13;
Hospital, Gradiska Hospital) were visited, to carry out a detailed inventory --analysis of the status of&#13;
structures and existing equipment with the MOH Working Group.&#13;
Data collection&#13;
General information on the organization and activities of the above four institutions was obtained&#13;
during preliminary meetings with the Hospital Directors and through a questionnaire sent to the hospitals.&#13;
In addition, visits to the Departments of Radiology, Clinical Laboratory, Surgery, ICU, Obstetrics &amp;&#13;
Gynecology and Hemodialysis of each hospital were carried out. The main goal of these visits was to set&#13;
up an inventory of the most important biomedical equipment installed in the above mentioned departments,&#13;
assessing the following characteristics for each piece of equipment:&#13;
- number and type of equipment;&#13;
- estimated age;&#13;

- level of usage;&#13;
-  status (good, medium, poor, very poor, damaged);&#13;
- maintenance (intemal technicians, manufacturer);&#13;
- estimated replacement cost of new equipment with similar or better functionality; and&#13;
- present source of consumables (donation, purchase, not available).&#13;
During the visits, data were collected for a detailed assessment of the status and consistency of&#13;
medical equipment installed in the health institutions. It is important to remember that the departments&#13;
visited hold the largest portion of the total value of medical equipment installed in general hospitals (75-&#13;
80%, according to data available from the scientific literature). Table I shows a general summary of the&#13;
replacement value of equipment in the three hospitals visited by the mission. Table 2 shows some basic&#13;
health factors (number of beds, population served, number of births per year) and some technology-related&#13;
indicators (equipment per bed, equipment per inhabitant) for these same three hospitals.&#13;
From the analysis of the data, it is possible to obtain some useful information for the assessment of&#13;
priorities and needs of health care structures in terms of technology. The average worth of equipment per&#13;
bed is around USS5,000, which is about 1/5 to 1/10 of the figure that we can find in Western European&#13;
countries. However, it should be noted that it is consistent with the pre-war per-capita GDP of Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina. This close relationship between per-capita GNP, per-capita health care expenditure, and per-&#13;
bed equipment has been demonstrated by a study (D. Bravar et al., IFMBE - CED) carried out at the&#13;
international level on industrialized and developing countries.&#13;
Assuming US$5,238 as the average ratio of equipment per bed in the country, the replacement&#13;
value of equipment in the remaining hospitals of RS has been estimated on the basis of the number of&#13;
active beds in each hospital. Table 3 shows the global estimate for the nine hospitals. According to the&#13;
replacement value of equipment, the yearly costs for maintenance, consumables and amortization&#13;
(assuming a 10-year life span of equipment) have been estimated. These figures are reported in Table 3.&#13;
A large portion of the equipment found in the hospitals (40%) is considered as obsolete, being&#13;
older than 15 years (X-ray equipment) or 10 years (other diagnostic and therapeutic equipment).&#13;
Approximately 1/3 of the remaining equipment, although not obsolete, is not functioning due to the total&#13;
lack of maintenance during the period of the war. This situation still persists, due to the total absence of&#13;
MOH resources for systematic maintenance and to the isolation of RS from the other countries of the&#13;
former Yugoslavia.&#13;
Determination of priorities for new biomedical equipment&#13;
On the basis of the data collected during the visits to the hospitals, a first estimate of needs was&#13;
prepared according to the following criteria:&#13;
- age and condition of existing biomedical equipment;&#13;
-  hospital size (no. of beds);&#13;
-  catchment area served by the hospital.&#13;
- pre-war, present and/or foreseen diagnostic and therapeutic activity; and&#13;
-  standardization of essential health services quality between hospitals.&#13;
In Appendix I ,Table 4, a program for the replacement of obsolete medical equipment is indicated&#13;
for each hospital. The program is intended as an investment plan to: (i) recover from a long period during&#13;
the war when no new equipment was purchased; (ii) assure, in the next 4-6 years, a reasonable level of&#13;
technology on which essential diagnostic and therapeutic services will be based. The aim of the plan is to&#13;
avoid an increase of the total technology installed in hospitals, which the limited financial resources of the&#13;

Goveniiiment could not sustain, and to replace only the obsolete equipment. According to the estimates&#13;
indicated above, 40% of existing equipment should be replaced, while the remaining 60% should be&#13;
maintained, with repair of 1/3 of the equipment currently out of use. Estimated costs for equipment&#13;
maintenance and for consumables for each of the priority hospitals and the Institute of Public Health are&#13;
reported in Table 4.&#13;
The availability of local technical resources to provide on-going equipment maintenance would&#13;
reduce substantially overall maintenance costs from the 9-10% normally charged in manufacturers' service&#13;
contracts to about 5% of the replacement cost of the equipment. To ensure that local technicians are&#13;
qualified to provide maintenance services, any provision of equipment will have to include technical&#13;
training courses, complete servicing technical documentation and an adequate quantity of the most&#13;
common spare parts. For the purposes of this report, the costs of consumables have been assessed both for&#13;
the new equipment supported by the program and for the already existing equipment. The criteria used to&#13;
evaluate the annual estimated expenditure for consumables associated with the equipment are based on the&#13;
following assumptions:&#13;
-  Radiology equipment: 20% of the replacement cost of equipment&#13;
-  Clinical Laboratory equipment: 95% of the replacement cost of equipment&#13;
-  Other equipment: 5% of the replacement cost of equipment&#13;
-  Hemodialysis equipment: US$30.000/year per dialysis unit&#13;
(US$60 per treatment x 2 patients/day x 250 days/year)&#13;
To calculate these percentages, data from national studies (Italian National Research Council -&#13;
1986, Italian Ministry of Health - 1994) and from international market analyses (Medical Markets in&#13;
Western Europe - MDIS Report - U.K. 1992) were used.&#13;
According to these assumptions and to the average distribution of medical equipment among the&#13;
different clinical sectors, a global yearly cost of consumables can be reasonably estimated at 25% of the&#13;
replacement value of the equipment. This average figure was used for the calculations in Table 4. In Table&#13;
5, the distribution of new equipment among the different clinical sectors is reported for each hospital. This&#13;
distribution reflects the present share of equipment value found in the hospitals visited:&#13;

Global program costs&#13;
The global costs of the program have been estimated both: (i) for the new equipment only and (ii)&#13;
for the new equipment, plus the 60% of existing equipment to be retained. The items evaluated are the&#13;
following:&#13;
-  cost of new medical equipment&#13;
-  cost of consumables for a period of 3 years&#13;
-  cost of technical training and of spare parts (to be provided with the new equipment)&#13;
-  cost of shipping and installation (15% of purchase cost)&#13;
-  cost of procurement services and technical assistance (2.5% of purchase cost)&#13;
-  cost of maintenance for a period of 3 years (5% of purchase cost)&#13;
-  repair of existing equipment damaged during the war (1/3 of the usable 60%)&#13;
-  physical contingencies (5% of total)&#13;
Appendix 1, Table 6 gives the cost estimate, for a period of 3 years, for the new equipment that&#13;
should be included in the program. The global running cost to be sustained (consumables, maintenance,&#13;
amortization) is about US$3.7 million per year.&#13;
Appendix 1, Table 7 indicates a similar estimate, for a period of 3 years, relevant to the 60% of&#13;
already existing equipment plus the new equipment, assuming that all pieces of equipment presently not&#13;
working for lack of maintenance will be brought back into use. The global running cost to be sustained is&#13;
about US$9 million per year. Assuming that the per-capita health care expenditure in the RS will rise, by&#13;
the year 2000, to a level similar to that in he Federation of BH (US$75-95 per year), the global&#13;
expenditure for 1.5 million inhabitants should be in the range of US$110 to 140 million per year.&#13;
Consequently, the figure previously reported for global running costs (US$9 million per year) is still&#13;
compatible with the medium- to long-term national expenditure for health care, representing about 6 to 8%&#13;
of the global budget.&#13;
Conclusions and recommendations&#13;
In the short period of time available for the mission (one week), it was possible to collect data&#13;
sufficient only for a rough appraisal of needs in terms of equipment and associated consumables.&#13;
Nevertheless, during that period, it was possible to gain an overview of the current status of RS hospitals,&#13;
and to develop a reasonable plan for future medical equipment investments with the aim of providing, for&#13;
the next few years, the minimal tools necessary to ensure a reasonable level of health services quality to the&#13;
population. A fundamental step in the implementation of the program will have to involve a precise and&#13;
detailed assessment of equipment installed in all hospitals in order develop a final updated list of&#13;
equipment to be provided under the Program, according to the most urgent priorities. In the acquisition&#13;
process, particular attention should be paid to the following issues:&#13;
* careful coordination of other donors' actions, in order to prevent duplications&#13;
* provision, together with the equipment, of all technical support necessary for thorough training&#13;
of local technicians&#13;
* provision of an adequate quantity of the most common spare parts&#13;
* commitment of manufacturers to provide all spare parts for a period of 10 years, with clear&#13;
modalities for the definition of price lists and delivery time&#13;
* provision of full technical documentation&#13;
* uniformity of equipment (in terms of manufacturers and models) in order to rationalize the&#13;
maintenance activities&#13;
* identification of a procurement agent able to provide a full technical coordination, monitoring&#13;
the flow of equipment and materials, acting as a technical interface to the international&#13;
&#13;

Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
Monitoring is the process of assessing the extent to which activities meet or deviate from&#13;
expectations, for the purpose of enabling improvements and corrections during implementation.&#13;
Monitoring would be done by tracking inputs according to component, activity and expenditure&#13;
category, as outlined in the Input Table on page 2 of this appendix.&#13;
Project Evaluation&#13;
Evaluation is the process of assessing the extent to which stated objectives are achieved.&#13;
The Project objectives are to: (i) strengthen essential hospital services, focusing on the most&#13;
needy segments of the population; and (ii) establish and support the initial steps of health finance&#13;
reform. Because the Project by itself would not have immediate measurable impacts on&#13;
aggregate health status, indicators of aggregate health status would be inappropriate --&#13;
conceptually and in practice -- for evaluating the Project. Accordingly, the indicators on page 3&#13;
of this appendix would be used as proxy-indicators for project evaluation. They were selected on&#13;
the basis of relevance to the project objectives, sensitivity to planned activities, ease of data&#13;
collection and parsimony.&#13;

Terms of Reference for Consultants&#13;
for&#13;
Health Finance Reform&#13;
(Draft of September 25, 1996)&#13;
1.    BACKGROUND&#13;
The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) is undertaking the initial stages&#13;
of reforming the country's health finance system. The reform is a part of the overall post-&#13;
war health sector development, and is being supported through the Health Finance&#13;
Reform Component of the Essential Hospital Services Project, financed in part by a&#13;
Credit from the International Development Association (IDA). The Health Finance&#13;
Reform Component of the Project is designed to assist the Government of BH, and more&#13;
specifically the Ministry of Health of each entity (the Federation of BH and the Republika&#13;
Srpska), in the initial stages of health finance reform.&#13;
2.    OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.1.  The broad objective of the Technical Assistance (TA) to be provided by the&#13;
consultants is to support the development of credible and effective process, delivering&#13;
specific interim products, in pursuit of: (a) an overall design for a coherent health&#13;
financing system that would achieve universal access, cost-containment, quality,&#13;
sustainability, effectiveness and efficiency objectives, and (b) the portability of access to&#13;
health care between the entities, within the provisions of the constitution of BH.&#13;
2.2.  More specifically, the objectives of the TA are:&#13;
2.2.1. To support the definition of the essential responsibilities of the Federation and the&#13;
Republika Srpska (RS) in financing a reformed health system, including but not limited&#13;
to the establishment, within constitutional provisions, of a common approach to issues of&#13;
access and service delivery, as well as the sets of arrangements for governance, financing&#13;
and administering the health sector on a sustainable basis.&#13;
2.2.2. To support the definition of options for assuring that all citizens in each entity&#13;
acquire and retain effective access to a minimum package of basic health care services.&#13;
2.2.3. To support the identification of a pragmatic, phased and sequenced series of&#13;
changes for transforming the current health financing regime in each entity into those&#13;
envisaged for the future, including viable options for promoting convergence toward a&#13;
common arrangement within constitutional provisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 12&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
3.    SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS&#13;
3.1.  Consultants are required to assist the Ministry of Health and appropriate&#13;
institutions in each entity to: (a) identify specific options, and the implications of those&#13;
options, for introducing a sustainable, efficient, effective and equitable health finance&#13;
regime; (b) conduct defined studies of limited scope in support of the decision making&#13;
process in each entity; and (c) develop the capacity of nationals of BH to manage the&#13;
health sector reform process successfully.&#13;
3.2.  Assistance is required for a relatively intense start-up phase including policy&#13;
analysis, relevant surveys of limited scope and training during the first year, followed by&#13;
on-going support for the initial stage of implementation during the second and third years&#13;
of the Project.&#13;
3.3.  Ultimately, policy decisions and strategic choices will be made by the people and&#13;
constituted authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The technical assistance is explicitly&#13;
intended to help the nationals and constituted authorities to bring objective criteria and&#13;
transparent processes to bear upon the decisions and choices.&#13;
4.    DETAILED SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
4.1.  Definition of the essential responsibilities of each entity.&#13;
4.1. .1. In the Federation, the TA would assist the Federation MOH to specify in more&#13;
detail the instruments and processes for reintegrating the health finance system, as stated&#13;
by the Government of BH in the Letter of Development Policy dated May 15, 1996&#13;
(Transition Assistance Credit, Report and Recommendation of the President of the&#13;
International Development Association, Number P-691 1-BIH, August 14, 1996).&#13;
4.1.2. In the Republika Srpska, the TA would assist the MOH to specify in more detail&#13;
the instruments and processes for achieving the broad objectives stated in the "Strategy&#13;
for Health Development for Republika Srpska by the Year 2000".&#13;
4.1.3. The TA would support the exploration and documentation of feasible options for&#13;
common, or at least compatible, approaches in the two entities, and would facilitate&#13;
communications according to a schedule to be deternined jointly by the MOH of both&#13;
entities, but in any case at least monthly.&#13;
4.1.4. The TA would include but not be limited to the definition of the appropriate&#13;
responsibilities and authorities of each MOH, each health insurance fund, cantonal and&#13;
municipal authorities for policy formulation, financial forecasting, business planning,&#13;
human resource planning, and related forms of regulatory activity (inicuding regulation of&#13;
private insurance).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 12&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
4.1.5. Sustainability requires that revenues be sufficient to cover costs in each time&#13;
period, for the system as a whole and for each component of the system that is expected&#13;
to be financially sustainable and in financial balance. Analyzing sustainability therefore&#13;
requires that both resources (and their sources) and costs (and their determinants) be&#13;
carefully examined. Assessment of the health system's financial sustainability should&#13;
therefore take into account such factors as revenue bases, efficiency of revenue collection,&#13;
incentives for providers and consumers to use resources efficiently, linking of decisions&#13;
on investments in medical equipment and technology to the affordability of their&#13;
recurrent costs, cost-containment strategies, scale of risk pooling, and exploitation of&#13;
economies of scale in health delivery and public health systems, revenue collection,&#13;
information systems, health insurance and provider payment systems, and evaluation&#13;
systems.&#13;
4.1.6. Sustainability analysis should take into account the sensitivity of projections to&#13;
assumptions made about the future rates and patterns of economic growth within each&#13;
entity. The results of the sustainability analyses should include the identification of&#13;
alternative ways of structuring the health sector with the potential to be financially&#13;
sustainable.&#13;
4.2.  Assuring Universal Access to Basic Care&#13;
4.2.1. The TA will support the identification of options and the implications of those&#13;
options for: (a) assuring that all people in the Federation and RS acquire and retain access&#13;
to a minimum package of basic health services and (b) the revenue base that would&#13;
support this mechanism in the medium term.&#13;
4.2.2. Technical work is required in the following areas: (a) identification and costing of&#13;
options; (b) setting transparent administrative procedures for implementation; (c)&#13;
identifying priority interventions; (d) indexing for inflation; (e) information needs --&#13;
demographic, epidemiologic, service delivery and financial (tax base and health&#13;
expenditures) and (f) systems for monitoring whether adequate access is in fact&#13;
universally available.&#13;
4.2.3. Transfer of skills to nationals of BH would be crucial to facilitate future iterations&#13;
of this exercise, as the working of the scheme will change as the economy recovers.&#13;
4.3.   Phases of implementation during the transition&#13;
4.3.1. The TA will support the identification of phased and sequenced series of&#13;
coordinated changes to transform the current health financing and delivery systems into&#13;
those envisaged for the future. The developmental tasks to be accomplished during the&#13;
transitional period should include the following:&#13;
(i) design of new hospital payment mechanisms and of a strategy for achieving a&#13;
slimmer, more cost-effective hospital sector;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 12&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
(ii) preliminary design of a restructured primary health care system and of new&#13;
mechanisms for financing primary care, including the financing links between&#13;
primary care, outpatient specialist care, and inpatient hospital care;&#13;
(iii) design of a new and consistent system for monitoring indicators of access to care,&#13;
quality of health care processes, health status, and health outcomes for each local&#13;
geographic area;&#13;
(iv)design of coordinated information and management systems for hospitals, primary&#13;
care providers, and insurance institutions that in turn would provide a data base&#13;
for each MOH's functions of research, planning, evaluation, and preparation of&#13;
inputs to national health expenditure accounts;&#13;
(v) design of future policies and procedures by which each MOH would regulate&#13;
cantonal/municipal health systems, including any processes for constraining total&#13;
health spending within each entity;&#13;
(vi)defining the basic package of care in terms of either covered health services or&#13;
threshold levels of average expenditure per person and developing new&#13;
administrative and financing mechanisms to ensure that low-income&#13;
cantons/rr.unicipalities can provide universal access to this package of care;&#13;
(vii) design of management systems, operating systems, and associated computer&#13;
hardware and software requirements for new insurance arrangements;&#13;
(viii) design of administrative systems that minimize costs by taking maximum&#13;
advantage of economies of scale; and&#13;
(ix)design of systems to address cross-cantonal and inter-entity issues such as&#13;
referrals and portability of access to health services.&#13;
5.    DELIVERABLES.&#13;
The following are key deliverables associated with the TA:&#13;
