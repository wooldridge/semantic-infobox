When sanitation sector professionals hear the words â&#128;&#152;sanitationâ&#128;&#153;            â&#128;¢ A national focus on sanitation carried out by the Gov-&#13;

sanitation in rural areas.                                                  â&#128;¢ Continued sanitation promotion reinforces latrine use&#13;

household practices through a national sanitation campaign that&#13;
engaged multiple levels of government. The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s goals&#13;
were to achieve 100% sanitation coverage and stop open defeca-&#13;
tion in rural areas by 2010.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This report includes qualitative and
            quantitative analysis on behavioral outcomes such as latrine
            use, sharing, disposal of children's feces, operation
            and maintenance, and upgrading/ repair to understand the
            factors that can lead to-or inhibit-sustainable sanitation
            outcomes. Information on private sector providers, costs of
            latrine parts and services, institutional factors, and
            perceived benefits of achieving Open Defecation Free (ODF)
            status. Throughout, there is a focus on the poor and how
            they compare to other households with more modest means.
            When sanitation sector professionals hear the words
            'sanitation' and 'Bangladesh' the first
            thought that may come to mind is that it is the birthplace
            of the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approach.
            However, there is more to the sanitation story from
            Bangladesh that needs to be shared. Lessons extracted from
            the Bangladesh experience could richly inform sanitation
            strategies in other countries, particularly those struggling
            to increase access to basic sanitation in rural areas. The
            study unions represented different geographic areas and the
            four implementation approaches mentioned. A household survey
            covered 3,000 households in 50 of the Union Parishads, and
            qualitative research was conducted in a sub-sample of 18
            Union Parishads.
