1. PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INDONESIA'S BIODIVERSITY RESOURCES&#13;
1.1    Biodiversity Value. Indonesia is rich in biodiversity. It contains nearly 10 percent of the&#13;
world's closed tropical forests. It also has extensive coral reefs and more marine coastline than any&#13;
other tropical country. Although the archipelago represents only 1.3 percent of the earth's land&#13;
surface, it contains an estimated 25 percent of the world's fish species, 17 percent of all bird species,&#13;
16 percent of reptile and amphibian species, 12 percent of mammal species, 10 percent of plant&#13;
species, and unknown numbers of species of invertebrate animals, fungi, and microorganisms.&#13;
These habitats and species are now threatened by logging, mining and over fishing, as well as by&#13;
agricultural development and other competing land uses.&#13;
1.2    Economic Importance. Indonesia's biological resources are economically important both&#13;
globally and nationally. Many plant species originated in Indonesia, including cloves, black pepper,&#13;
sugar cane and several tropical fruits. Indonesians use over 6,000 species of plants and animals.&#13;
Daily they gather or cultivate these species for food, handicrafts, medicines, fuel and building&#13;
materials. Some 40 million people directly depend on a wide range of forest and non-forest products&#13;
for subsistence.  Natural ecosystems, and the environmental functions they protect, strongly&#13;
influence Indonesia's agriculture, forestry, livestock and fisheries which together contributed about&#13;
19 percent of GDP in 1993 directly; a significant proportion of industry sector output is also highly&#13;
dependent on natural resources.&#13;
1.3    Biodiversity Areas. The biodiversity and natural habitats most at stake for priority in situ&#13;
conservation are the 49 million hectares (ha) of terrestrial areas, as well as the 30 million ha of&#13;
marine and littoral habitats, which GOI has identified for conservation by the year 2000. In addition,&#13;
there are some 65 million ha designated for production forests, which have an equally important&#13;
share of the biodiversity and natural habitats, particularly the lowland forests. While certain of these&#13;
lowland forests would therefore also call for conservation, as a priority, most of these areas require&#13;
sustainable management. .Out of the 366 established conservation areas, there are 33 National Parks,&#13;
covering nearly 8.8 million ha, one of which is Kerinci Seblat. the focus of this project. The Kerinci&#13;
Seblat National Park (KSNP) spans four provinces in Sumatra covering some 1.3 million ha. The&#13;
Park and its adjacent forests have been internationally recognized as one of the most important&#13;
conservation areas in Southeast Asia.'&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

B. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
1.4    Biodiversity Action Plan. This plan, prepared in 1991/92, is the main policy statement by&#13;
GOI for Indonesia's biodiversity conservation strategy. The Plan provides a framework for&#13;
biodiversity conservation during the current five-year Development Plan (REPELITA VI - 1994/5-&#13;
1998/9) and for the twenty-five Year Development Plan. The main objectives of the Plan are to (a)&#13;
reduce the loss of terrestrial and marine habitats of primary importance for biodiversity; (b) expand&#13;
biodiversity data and information to policy makers and the public; and (c) foster the sustainable use&#13;
of biological resources. The strategy to attain these objectives would be carried out through an&#13;
integrated process of institutional, policy and legal reform and development coupled with investment&#13;
through selected projects. The Plan has four components. First, in situ conservation in National&#13;
Parks, reserves and protection forests; second, in situ conservation outside the protected area&#13;
network in forests, wetlands and agricultural landscapes; third, in situ conservation of marine and&#13;
coastal resources; and fourth, ex-situ conservation, including gene and seed banks, preservation of&#13;
crop varieties, and captive breeding programs.  An important prerequisite for the Plan's&#13;
implementation is an increased participation by the public, particularly by communities living in and&#13;
adjacent to areas of high biodiversity value. The Plan also provides for local NGOs to play an active&#13;
role in fostering such participation.&#13;
1.5    The legal framework. Indonesia has ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity and&#13;
has an international and legal commitment to both conserve and sustainably use its biodiversity,&#13;
including the equitable sharing of benefits. One of the main laws regulating in situ biodiversity&#13;
conservation is Law No. 5/1990 on Living Natural Resources and Their Ecosystems. This law&#13;
provides the legal basis for the enactment of National Parks and other protected areas and refers to&#13;
the possibility of sustainable use of living natural resources. It also provides a concept of zoning&#13;
within these conservation areas (core zone, use zone for recreation and tourism, wilderness zone and&#13;
traditional management zone). The law is also specific about the buffer zone and describes it as an&#13;
area outside the conservation area capable of protecting the integrity of the conservation areas by&#13;
providing natural symbiosis between all forms of life, ensuring sustainable ecological balance and a&#13;
higher quality of life for the community. However, implementing regulations or models for&#13;
National Park and buffer zone development have not yet been introduced. Another important law&#13;
concerns the Spatial Management Law No. 24 of 1992. This law intends to combine spatial&#13;
management with resource utilization and requires that all provinces and districts formulate spatial&#13;
plans. It also provides for the spatial management of protection areas, including National Parks, and&#13;
suggests that National Parks of the dimensions of KSNP would justify a separate spatial plan and&#13;
subsequently be integrated in the provincial spatial plans. While the law addresses general&#13;
environmental concerns, biodiversity conservation has not been singled out as an issue in its own&#13;
right nor as a condition for sustaining ecological balance in-and outside a National Park. The subject&#13;
of land and user rights for people living within the Park and buffer zone is addressed in a number of&#13;
laws (e.g. Basic Agrarian and Forestry laws). Individual and community rights related to forest lands&#13;
remain in general a major source of dispute, and in the particular case of KSNP, this is aggravated by&#13;
the fact that Park boundary for the proposed project, including the delineation of forest/non forest&#13;
boundary within the buffer zone, has not yet been confirmed in its entirety.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
1.6   The strategy taken in Indonesia to manage the conservation areas, including their&#13;
biodiversity, is through Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDPs). This approach&#13;
attempts to ensure the conservation of biological diversity by reconciling the management of&#13;
protected areas with social and economic needs of local people. These projects range from small&#13;
biosphere reserves with multiple-use area within the boundary of the protected area, to larger&#13;
projects which link land use plans and regional development initiatives to protected area&#13;
management. In Indonesia there are currently eight National Parks where ICDP's will be tested.2&#13;
The ICDP approach in Indonesia seeks the systematic devolution of management responsibility to&#13;
people living around the protected area. This requires a steady decentralization of management&#13;
authority to local agencies, including the funding of protected areas.&#13;
C. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGEMENT OF PROTECTED AREAS&#13;
1.7   The designated government authority responsible for the management and stewardship of the&#13;
protected area system is the Directorate General of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation&#13;
(PHPA) within the Ministry of Forestry (MoFr). PHPA's mandate covers the planning, designation&#13;
and management of all protected areas, and the planning and supervision of protection forests. At&#13;
the provincial level, PHPA is represented by the Natural Resources Sub Regional Office (Sub-Balai&#13;
Konservasi Sumber Daya Alam) under the authority of the provincial forestry department (Kepala&#13;
Kanwil Departemen Kehutanan), headed by a representative of the Minister of Forestry. In addition&#13;
there are regional representatives of the DG PHPA called Balai KSDA covering several provinces&#13;
with sub-offices in each province. Most National Parks are managed by a special body, the National&#13;
Park Office or Management Unit, headed by a director who reports directly to the DG PHPA through&#13;
the Provincial Forestry office.&#13;
1.8   The responsibility for survey and demarcation of protected area boundaries in the field rests&#13;
with the DG of Forest Inventory and Management (INTAG). The mandate for enforcement of&#13;
protected area legislation is with PHPA in cooperation with local law enforcement agencies. The&#13;
area bordering the protected area -- the buffer zone--is managed by provincial and district&#13;
authorities. The key person is the Bupati, the head of the district (Kabupaten), who is responsible for&#13;
coordinating and managing all government activities in the district. He is assisted in his task by the&#13;
provincial planning board (BAPPEDA II) who plays a key role in coordinating, planning, advising&#13;
and monitoring developmrent programs and the (Dinas) technical agencies that implement sectoral&#13;
programs. For the past several years the National Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) with the Ministry&#13;
of Forestry has convened a national forum to coordinate agency planning and development activities&#13;
in areas surrounding National Parks. Other institutions that have responsibility for managing&#13;
biodiversity include: Ministry of Environment, Agriculture, Home Affairs, and the Indonesian&#13;
Institute of Science (LIPI). There are several institutional and policy constraints facing GOI as it&#13;
attempts to implement its protected areas conservation strategy. PHPA and other institutions with&#13;
responsibility for biodiversity conservation suffer from an acute lack of trained and dynamic staff,&#13;
frequent transfer of experienced staff, and a lack of adequate funding. Coordination between the&#13;
2 The eight national parks include Gunung Leuser, Kerinci Seblat, Gede-Pangrango, Halimun, Bromo-Tengger Semeru, Kutai,&#13;
Dumoga-Bone and Lore Lindu.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
forestry agencies and the regional governments in the management and enforcement of rules and&#13;
regulations in and around protected areas is often totally lacking. This situation is exacerbated by&#13;
the lack of effective incentives for local governments and smallholders to protect habitat and&#13;
biodiversity, and of integrated management plans that link management of protected areas with&#13;
district or provincial development plans.&#13;
D. KERINCI SEBLAT NATIONAL PARK'S SETTING&#13;
1.9   The KSNP is the largest conservation area in Sumatra, straddling the four provinces of West&#13;
Sumatra, Jambi, Bengkulu, and South Sumatra (see map). With an area of about 1.3 million ha the&#13;
Park is one of the largest conservation areas in South East Asia. Based on extensive field surveys by&#13;
FAO and PHPA the Park was nominated in 1982 by the Minister of Forestry as a National Park.&#13;
However, it is only now that MOFr is preparing the final text of the decree that will formally gazette&#13;
Kerinci Seblat as a National Park. The Park boundary demarcation process is nearly completed and&#13;
most boundaries adjoining settlements have been demarcated but not yet agreed upon by all&#13;
stakeholders. There are some 450 villages in the nine districts which share common boundaries with&#13;
the Park. The population of the sub-districts closest to the Park is approximately 1.75 million. In&#13;
some villages, the boundary demarcation is under review, as some of their agricultural land has&#13;
fallen within the Park. The project will focus on these villages in the area/village component. There&#13;
is considerable ethnic variation between the villages and some evidence of nomadic Kubu people&#13;
(Orang Rimba) entering the Park buffer zone to hunt.&#13;
1.10   The Park and its environs encompass a spectrum of habitats from species-rich lowland&#13;
forests through hill forests and unique highland wetland systems to montane forests and subalpine&#13;
habitats on Sumatra's highest mountain. The Park is remarkable for its species richness with more&#13;
than 4000 plants (1/60 of the world total), 180 birds (1/50 of all birds), including at least 14 of the 20&#13;
Sumatran mainland endemics, and 144 mammals (73 percent of the Sumatran mammal fauna and&#13;
1/30 of the world total, including five island endemics). Many of the habitats and species protected&#13;
within the Park and its immediate forest buffer zone are poorly represented or absent from other&#13;
conservation areas in Sumatra or elsewhere in Asia. This area harbors some of the last viable&#13;
populations of endangered mammals such as the endemic Sumatran hare Nesolagus netscheri,&#13;
Sumatran rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, Sumatran tiger Panthera tigris sumatrensis, clouded&#13;
leopard Neofelis nebulosa, Malay tapir Tapirus indicus and Asian elephants Elephas maximus.&#13;
Many of the large predators and forest herbivores require large areas of lowland forests and other&#13;
natural habitats to protect their home ranges and ensure access to vital mineral-licks. The high&#13;
biodiversity value of the Park and surrounding forests is a result of both the area's large size and&#13;
wide range of habitats and is dependent on the long-term protection of an adequate continuum of&#13;
habitats from lowland forests to subalpine montane systems. The integrity of the Park and its high&#13;
biodiversity values are threatened by encroachment from shifting cultivation and cinnamon&#13;
plantations, forest logging, mining, commercial plantations and road development.&#13;
1.11   There are twelve forest concessions (HPHs) bordering the Park (see map). These HPHs total&#13;
some one million ha and provide potentially an important buffer zone habitat for biodiversity&#13;
conservation. In 1985 over 200,000 ha of lowland and hill forest were transferred from the proposed&#13;
Park mainly to benefit the logging concessions in Jambi. The HPH areas are based on a thirty-five&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
year logging cycle, but the actual leases for the concessions to private logging companies are for&#13;
twenty years. The precise location of the concession boundaries are difficult to determine given the&#13;
large areas concerned and the nature of the terrain. This can quite easily lead to logging operations&#13;
taking place in protected or other conservation forest areas. While the legal framework covering&#13;
forest exploitation seems to be adequate, supervision of logging plans and operations by the&#13;
responsible provincial forest service is inadequate so that the implementation and enforcement of&#13;
appropriate logging practices is generally poor, threatening biodiversity and affecting watershed&#13;
management.&#13;
1.12   Apart from being surrounded by estate crop areas and transmigration settlements, KSNP also&#13;
has a number of gold and coal mining concessions straddling the Park. Most of the small&#13;
concessions belong to domestic companies; the fewer but bigger ones are owned by Indonesian-&#13;
foreign joint ventures. Most operations are in the exploration stage with the smaller ones not very&#13;
active due to lack of capital. No economically mineable resources have so far been revealed in the&#13;
Park and together with the fact that existing laws and regulations are generally putting limitations on&#13;
mining activities in gazetted National Parks, it is believed that mining operations on the Kerinci&#13;
Seblat Park and its environment will be limited and controlled.&#13;

2. BANK/GEF INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS GEF AND BANK OPERATIONS&#13;
2.1    The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has supported two biodiversity conservation&#13;
initiatives in Indonesia: the Biodiversity Collections Project (US$7.2 million) and the Conservation&#13;
Strategies for Rhinos in Southeast Asia Project (US$2.0 million). An amount of US$1.56 million&#13;
from the GEF[UNDP Pre-lnvestment Facility (PRIF) was approved to finance preparation of the&#13;
Biodiversity Collections Project, Kerinci Seblat ICDP and a Conservation Awareness Program.&#13;
Project implementation under the Bank managed Biodiversity Collections Project is proceeding&#13;
well, with technical advisors recruited and workshop and key planning/consultation activities well&#13;
underway. The UNDP managed South East Asia Rhinos Project will develop organized and trained&#13;
rhino protection units in KSNP to assist in anti-poaching and community outreach programs. As&#13;
both operations are newly launched it is too early to draw applicable lessons for KSNP.&#13;
2.2    Over the period 1988-1995, the Bank committed a total of US$731 million of its own&#13;
resources and resources it administers on behalf of the international development community to 84&#13;
projects or project components with explicit objectives for biodiversity conservation in 51 countries&#13;
around the world3. Bank support to parks and protected areas has grown rapidly over the last five&#13;
years. The Bank's IBRD/IDA portfolio of biodiversity related activities has included some twenty-&#13;
seven projects with a total loan/credit value of US$287 million equivalent between FY92-95. In&#13;
addition, the Bank (as GEF implementing agency) has worked closely with local project sponsors on&#13;
thirty one biodiversity programs, for which the GEF Participants/Council have allocated US$244&#13;
million between FY92-95. In an independent evaluation of the GEF pilot phase (11/93), the&#13;
assessment of some thirty UNDP/WB biodiversity projects showed that: (a) too little consideration&#13;
had been given to local people, their expertise and priorities, and the need to engage and empower&#13;
local communities, NGOs and other stakeholders in designing and implementing projects; (b) NGO&#13;
involvement was found to be inadequate; (c) long-term financing of such projects was sometimes&#13;
doubtful; and (d) the need to monitor and evaluate arrangements in projects and adopt an action-&#13;
learning approach with the flexibility to adapt project activities to take account of lessons learned&#13;
during implementation. Similar observations are found in the 1991 OED analysis of forestry and&#13;
conservation lending, which also concluded that: (a) realistic incentives are needed for conservation&#13;
activities, and (b) conservation and buffer zone management components should be based on a clear&#13;
prioritization of areas and a realistic plan for related rural development activities targeted to nearby&#13;
populations.&#13;
2.3   In Indonesia, the Bank has supported investment in management and infrastructure&#13;
development in twelve National Parks in Indonesia through the Forestry Institutions and&#13;
Conservation Projects I &amp; II. These projects have revealed PHPA institutional weaknesses which&#13;
KSNP will also have to face, namely, frequent movement of senior staff, moratorium of recruiting&#13;
new guard staff with low educational qualifications, lack of incentives for technicians and guards to&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
perform their assigned tasks, and overemphasis on blueprints and planning rather than learning by trying&#13;
and doing. More generally, experience with the Bank's portfolio in Indonesia has highlighted difficulties&#13;
associated with: (a) inter-agency coordination; and (b) timely appointment of consultants and their&#13;
effective interaction with government staff. The proposed project will address these difficulties by&#13;
building on some very positive experiences gained from WWF and WARSI (a group of local NGOs)&#13;
involvement in community participation and village development around Kerinci Seblat. The approach&#13;
will be a rebalancing of responsibilities toward decentralized government agencies, NGOs, and local&#13;
communities. Project design has built on the lessons learned from conservation project experience in&#13;
Indonesia and elsewhere. The principal lesson is that projects which have focused on purely biological&#13;
and ecological concerns, and have attempted to insulate the project site from surrounding economic and&#13;
social pressures, have often failed. This project recognizes that protection of the biodiversity assets of&#13;
this large and populous area can only be achieved through significant change in social and economic&#13;
factors affecting the lives of people who live and work in the Park, and its surrounding areas.&#13;
B. RATIONALE FOR GEF/BANK FINANCING AND CONSISTENCY WITH COUNTRY ASSISTANCE&#13;
STRATEGY AND ECONOMIC &amp; SECTOR WORK&#13;
2.4    The proposed project is fully consistent with the Convention on Biological Diversity and&#13;
guidance from the Conference of the Parties. It has been identified as a national priority in the&#13;
Biodiversity Action Plan- (see para 1.4) and proposed activities will: strengthen conservation,&#13;
management and sustainable use of ecosystems and habitats (including threatened lowland and hill&#13;
forests as well as montane habitats); demonstrate innovative measures (linking conservation and district&#13;
development) to conserve biodiversity; and give priority to involvement of local people in Park and&#13;
natural resource management. KSNP and its surrounding forests can be regarded as one of the last&#13;
opportunities in Southeast Asia to conserve a diverse and complex mammal predator-prey system.&#13;
Forestry management to integrate conservation values into forestry practice and maintain permanent&#13;
forest cover in the Kerinci forest buffer zone will not only effectively increase the conservation estate by&#13;
maintaining natural habitat beyond Park boundaries, but could provide a model for sustainable forestry&#13;
throughout Indonesia.&#13;
2.5    The proposed Kerinci Seblat ICDP is also consistent with the Bank's Country's Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia which was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on March 21,&#13;
1995. This strategy projects increased lending for natural resources and conservation management, and&#13;
focuses on sustainable environmental and natural resource management, targeted poverty reduction,&#13;
human resource development, and more decentralized and participatory approaches. Assistance will&#13;
focus on watershed management and conservation, integrated management and conservation of National&#13;
Parks (both terrestrial and marine), and coral reef rehabilitation and management. The project is a&#13;
logical progression from the Bank's past support for conservation issues. These include efforts at&#13;
supporting Park planning and management and the on-going Biodiversity Collections Project which will&#13;
improve GOI's capacity in. biodiversity inventory and monitoring. The proposed Kerinci Seblat ICDP&#13;
project is viewed by GOI as the demonstration model for future National Park interventions elsewhere in&#13;
the country, and both GOI and the Bank are heavily committed to its successful implementation. With&#13;
respect to Economic and Sector work this project follows the recommendations of the Bank study on&#13;
Conserving Biological Diversity in the Asian Pacific Region (1992) and the Bank Country Study for&#13;
Indonesia on environment and development (1994).&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   Project Concept. The project would address the first objective of the Biodiversity Action&#13;
Plan (in situ conservation of natural habitats para. 1.4) and is largely process oriented. While it&#13;
would primarily focus on the protection of one of the country's largest National Parks, it would deal&#13;
with major institutional, policy and development issues whose resolution is vital for the development&#13;
of an integrated protected- area system covering all major terrestrial habitats in Indonesia. It would&#13;
strengthen PHPA, the main agency responsible for conservation areas. On the developmental side, it&#13;
would use an integrated conservation and development approach (ICDP) that reconciles Park&#13;
management with the social and economic needs of the local people and within the framework of&#13;
some of the development goals set for the four provinces bordering the Park. This requires a steady&#13;
decentralization of management authority to local agencies and governments. It would aim at&#13;
finding better modus operandi for local community participation and the use of NGOs in&#13;
management decision making concerning Park boundary demarcation and land use and buffer zone&#13;
regulations.&#13;
3.2   Specific Project Objectives.  The overall objective of the project is to secure the&#13;
biodiversity of KSNP and stop further habitat fragmentation by: (a) improving Park protection and&#13;
management, including the involvement of local communities; and (b) promoting sustainable&#13;
management and the maintenance of permanent forest cover in the remaining buffer zone concession&#13;
areas. The project will develop a model for ICDP which can be applied to other Parks in the&#13;
Indonesia protected area system (and elsewhere in Asia) to reconcile conservation and regional and&#13;
district development. The ICDP would follow an integrated two pronged approach to help stabilize&#13;
the Park boundary and protect biodiversity within the Park and adjacent areas, as well as to enhance&#13;
the livelihoods of poor households living around the KSNP by providing them with alternative&#13;
livelihood opportunities consistent with Park conservation objectives. The project design proposes&#13;
to meet this objective by institutional strengthening in the areas of integrated planning, coordinated&#13;
implementation and regular monitoring and enforcement at provincial and local levels; building&#13;
institutional capacity through increased staffing and in-service training; and improving livelihoods&#13;
through improved resource management and services delivery.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.3   The background for project design and components is based on eighteen technical reports&#13;
(see Annex 14) completed in June 1993 and funded by the GEF/UNDP Pre-Investment Facility (para&#13;
2.1). Detailed design followed with funding provided by a Japanese Grant. Community and&#13;
stakeholder consultation activities have played a major role in project preparation and design.&#13;
Beginning in 1992, preparation teams have engaged in rapid rural appraisal exercises in boundary&#13;
villages with the objective of creating village profiles, understanding land use patterns and people-&#13;
Park interactions, and eliciting stakeholder feedback on ICDP design. Wherever possible, project&#13;
activities will build on local knowledge and practices that are compatible with biodiversity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
conservation and sustainable use of resources in and around KSNP. Annex 2 provides social&#13;
assessment information particularly relevant to the Park's buffer zone communities. The area/village&#13;
development component will focus on the target groups identified, most of which belong to the&#13;
poorer sections of Indonesia's population. Annex 3 provides a summary table of the major&#13;
consultation activities that have taken place during the preparation phase, including workshops with&#13;
foreign and local NGOs, affected villagers, and government officials. The proposed project to be&#13;
implemented over a six-year period will include four major components which are complementary to&#13;
project objectives: (a) park management; (b) area and village development; (c) integrating&#13;
biodiversity in forest concession management; and (d) monitoring and evaluation. Supporting&#13;
activities are: (a) policy and planning; (b) training and community facilitation; (c) promotion of&#13;
conservation awareness; and (d) studies.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
3.4   Park Management (estimated costs US$13.4 million).  One of the first major project&#13;
activities will be the preparation and implementation of a management plan, including zonation, for&#13;
KSNP. The component will strengthen Park protection, management, enforcement and participatory&#13;
planning through institutional strengthening of Park personnel, training and infrastructure support. It&#13;
will also support boundary rationalization activities, species inventory, ecological monitoring, socio-&#13;
economic and other research necessary for Park and buffer zone planning and management. The&#13;
component will be implemented by a Park director and his staff, supported by technical assistance.&#13;
More detailed information is provided in Annex 1, with full details in Working Paper I of Annex 14.&#13;
Given the institutional and management constraints facing the Park, a longer time horizon beyond the&#13;
initial six year project period will be required to implement the strategy to elevate the Park to a fully&#13;
protected and functioning conservation estate. Accordingly, the Park management strategy is based on&#13;
short, medium and long-term objectives as follows:&#13;
Short-Term (1-2 years):&#13;
D Legal establishment of the Park through formal gazettement and further boundary&#13;
rationalization.;&#13;
* Mobilization of senior and junior staff, including technical assistance; and&#13;
* Set up of management plan, M&amp;E system and training.&#13;
Medium-Term (3-12 years):&#13;
*  Develop and implement a Park management plan including a comprehensive zoning&#13;
system;&#13;
*  Develop and reinforce Park management and protection, including efficient coordination&#13;
with local government;&#13;
*  Effective protection for the preservation of viable natural ecosystems and endangered&#13;
species:&#13;
*  Improve management of people-Park interactions, particularly with buffer zone local&#13;
communities; and&#13;
*  Facilitate human use for recreation and education;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Long-Term (13-25 years):&#13;
*  Regenerate degraded areas;&#13;
*  Maintain habitats for specific conservation objectives; and&#13;
*  Focus activities to utilize the Park for recreation, research and tourism.&#13;
3.5    AreaNVillage Development (estimated costs US$25.9 million).  The area development&#13;
component is designed to improve land use planning, land use rights and community resource&#13;
management in about 134 selected villages in the interaction zone surrounding the Park, including&#13;
villages adjoining or within logging concessions bordering the Park. It will be based on an iterative&#13;
participatory development process involving four steps namely: situational assessment, designing&#13;
village development plans, implementing and monitoring, and review and evaluation leading to a&#13;
revised design. The main aim of this process is to arrive at a village conservation agreement (VCA)&#13;
which legalizes village access to resources in the Park and its buffer zone (e.g. access to non-timber&#13;
forest products, intensification of agricultural production systems and community forestry) or social&#13;
benefits (such as improved marketing and village infrastructure improvements, including processing&#13;
and storage) and guarantees specified development assistance in return for community cooperation&#13;
in Park protection and conserving biodiversity resources on village lands. This process, that will&#13;
require a long preparation and delivery time of up to three years, will be initiated and sustained in&#13;
each target community by resident project facilitators in collaboration with formal village leaders,&#13;
traditional and formal village groups. While the target group of resource-poor farmers most&#13;
dependent on the Park will be the main focus of this activity, the overall village community will&#13;
necessarily be parties to this consensus VCA.  In villages adjoining forest concessions, the&#13;
component will mainly promote community forestry management. Some key preparatory work in&#13;
regard to planning and training has already been commenced by WWF and financed by the Japanese&#13;
grant (para 3.3). Further details of this component are shown in Annex 1 with full details on&#13;
operation and legal framework given in the Working Papers 2, 3 and 9 in Annex 14.&#13;
3.6    Each of the target villages will receive about US$50,000 as village grants, depending on their&#13;
needs, for a combination of small-scale infrastructure, agriculture intensification and business/&#13;
enterprise activities. Much of the budget allocation process will follow the process of "Certification&#13;
for Development Assistance Budget" (SPABP). The Village Community Resilience Institution&#13;
(LKMD) and the Discussion Forum of the Area Development Unit (UDKP) at sub-district level will&#13;
form the key local institutions for implementing the program (see Chart 1). Project assistance&#13;
provided for the agriculture related activities may consist of community or individually focused&#13;
activities which are based on a menu of indicative interventions and guiding principles rather than&#13;
the standard top-down sub-sectoral packages provided by the provincial agricultural service.&#13;
Activities will be based on areas' potential in terms of natural resources which vary considerably,&#13;
(altitudes ranging from 0-2000m, climate, topography and in particular the difference between&#13;
volcanic and podzolic soils). Nevertheless, there will be two generic benefits which will be&#13;
generated by the project. The first will be related to the poor soils encountered in the podzolic lands&#13;
used by villages, most of which have a fertility problem which can be improved by large initial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
applications of rock phosphate.  The other one will be related to genetic and management&#13;
improvements in the availability of tree crop related stock (e.g. jungle rubber). The technical&#13;
support team (para. 4.4) would evaluate each of the proposed village activities and productive&#13;
investments and their recommendations for improvement would be taken into consideration for the&#13;
implementation of subsequent activities.&#13;
3.7    The eligibility criteria associated with the village development investments would be based&#13;
on: (a) conservation of biodiversity; (b) targeting common interest groups which are most&#13;
disadvantaged; (c) technical and financial feasibility; social and institutional feasibility; and (d)&#13;
impact and sustainability. Additional requirements are: (a) public infrastructure investments must&#13;
be justified by the number of users and the cost per user; (b) village grant and village contributions,&#13;
including labor, must be sufficient to complete the sub project; and (c) implementation/contractual&#13;
arrangements must be clear. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that village grants would be&#13;
made available in accordance with procedures and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
3.8   Integrating Biodiversity in Forest Concession Management (estimated costs US$2.9&#13;
million). The primary objectives of this component are the following:&#13;
* establishment of a clear institutional and policy basis for the effective management of&#13;
forested areas bordering the Park to act as an effective buffer zone for biodiversity;&#13;
*  identification, monitoring and protection of high biodiversity sites of conservation value&#13;
within the concessions; and&#13;
*  linking the management of forest concessions with the overall regional land use priorities&#13;
supported by the project.&#13;
3.9    One of the main activities to be undertaken under this component will be ecological and&#13;
biodiversity assessments of the logging concession areas with the view for GOI to reallocate forest&#13;
land to appropriate land use and management regimes as needed in the six logging concessions.&#13;
This process would also assist in the rationalization of the Park boundary (see paras. 5.12-5.14).&#13;
Some initial survey work has already commenced through WWF/CIFOR (Center for International&#13;
Forestry Research) assistance and financed by the Japanese Grant (para 3.3). The intention is that&#13;
the rapid ecological assessments will be complemented by the longer term KPHP (Permanent&#13;
Production Forest Management Units) process. The KPHP is a new program instituted by MOFr as&#13;
a planning mechanism to redefine concession boundaries based on land use, biophysical and social&#13;
development considerations. As part of this process, areas of high biodiversity or watershed&#13;
conservation values would be identified so that they can be left as protected forest areas within the&#13;
concession. The component will also include independent audit contracts to review and monitor&#13;
forestry logging and conservation practices in some selected forestry concessions around the Park.&#13;
The audits will be based on standards for forest management, environmental and social performance&#13;
and contracts will be issued by the Directorate General for Forest Utilization. Further details are&#13;
described in Annex 1 and in Working Paper 4 of Annex 14.&#13;
3.10   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) (estimated costs US$3.8 million). M&amp;E is a support&#13;
component which is linked to the project's Park management, area/village development and&#13;
concession management for biodiversity activities. The M&amp;E is intended to support the planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
and decision-making processes in each of the three intervention components and are key to their&#13;
effective implementation.  The proposed project monitoring activity will support three major&#13;
planning and resource management functions: (a) technical and financial progress monitoring; (b)&#13;
impact analysis; and (c) performance evaluation.  Specific objectives for each of the three&#13;
components include the following:&#13;
Park Management&#13;
* to provide appropriate tools for monitoring encroachment, poaching and other development&#13;
impacts within Park boundaries; and&#13;
* to develop monitoring and performance indicators to assess the health and well-being of the&#13;
Park such as boundary stability, habitat condition, species survival and distribution.&#13;
Area/Village Development&#13;
* to strengthen institutional capabilities for analyzing the impact of rural development&#13;
activities on the Park; and&#13;
* to facilitate the assessment of project effectiveness in enhancing social and economic&#13;
development for boundary communities.&#13;
Integrating Biodiversity in Forest Concession Management&#13;
e to establish a system for monitoring the integrity of Park and concession boundaries,&#13;
including the effectiveness of preserving biodiversity; and&#13;
* to develop a capability to monitor and evaluate forest management practices within&#13;
concession areas, including the success of conservation sites within concession boundaries.&#13;
Further details are described in Annex I and in Working Paper 5 of Annex 14.&#13;
Additional Project Activities (included above but not described).&#13;
3.11  Policy and Planning (US$1.7 million). Project interventions in policy and planning will be&#13;
mainly focused on the improvement of the regulatory guidelines for inter-provincial spatial planning&#13;
and regional planning practices with the aim to influence the regional economic development of the&#13;
greater Kerinci Seblat area in taking more "conservation friendly" directions. The project intends to&#13;
do this through the support of three activities:&#13;
* short-term policy and planning support to BAPPENAS and the Ministry of Home Affairs at&#13;
the central level to incorporate environmental concerns, particularly related to biodiversity&#13;
conservation, in the regulatory guidelines of regional and spatial planning;&#13;
* long-term support to BAPPEDA I and 11 for provincial and district planning in the four&#13;
provinces encompassing KSNP, particularly to ensure that KSNP's development will&#13;
reflect agreed community resource management and conservation priorities; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
the preparation of a comprehensive land zoning plan for the entire project area which will&#13;
address inter-provincial development priorities, including forest production, commercial&#13;
plantations, mining and infrastructure and transportation development, so that the landuse&#13;
zonation and management of the Park and its buffer zone can be endorsed by the four&#13;
provincial governments. Further details are provided in the preparation report and the&#13;
regional and spatial planning Working Paper 6 shown in Annex 14 and its costs are mainly&#13;
included in the area/village development component.&#13;
3.12   Training and Community Facilitation (US$6.1 million). Specific training activities have&#13;
been identified (see Annex I and 14) for each component that are necessary for capacity building&#13;
and successful project implementation (see para. 4.7). The project will assist in designing and&#13;
conducting a training needs assessment of all involved stakeholders, the implementation of relevant&#13;
theoretical and practical training programs, contracting of training services, and supervision and&#13;
monitoring of training impacts.  The extension services in the districts will be used in the&#13;
area/village development component as and when required and will complement the community&#13;
facilitation process. (See Working Paper 3 in Annex 14).&#13;
3.13   Conservation Awareness (US$1.3 million). The Biodiversity Conservation Promotions&#13;
Program (BCPP) included in the project will play a key role within Park management and rural&#13;
development activities by disseminating information to people in boundary villages, government&#13;
agencies and the community at large on the value of the Park for biodiversity, watershed protection,&#13;
and local development. It will assist in the survey of current awareness levels and attitude, and&#13;
design multi-media programs aimed at specific target groups, building on local practices and&#13;
traditions wherever possible. Details of this activity are shown in Annex 9 tables 1.2/3 and in the&#13;
BCPP Working Paper 7 in Annex 14.&#13;
Studies (US$0.8 million)&#13;
3.14   Financial Sustainability. KSNP will require a long-term sustained program of investment&#13;
and institutional development to achieve its overall goal of conserving biodiversity through&#13;
integrated buffer zone development.  The proposed project would contribute to long-term&#13;
sustainability through its emphasis on capacity-building and community involvement in project&#13;
design and implementation. In addition, recurrent costs associated with proposed project activities&#13;
will be financed by GOI during the project period, reflecting the national commitment to effective&#13;
operation of KSNP and ICDP activities. The project's fiscal requirements over the long term are not&#13;
escalating. However, to protect the Park from any possible budget cut, and to ensure financial&#13;
sustainability beyond the project period, GOI wishes to explore what options would be available for&#13;
future recurrent cost/investment financing and development assistance for both the Park and buffer&#13;
zones on an off-budget basis. The study would review the structure by which money could be raised&#13;
for and spent on protected areas management and come up with an approach to ensure continuity of&#13;
funding sources, including decentralized funding mechanisms with responsiveness to local&#13;
conditions as the guiding principles. The study would include also a review of the feasibility and&#13;
requirements for establishing a trust fund or other financing mechanism. Consequently, during years&#13;
1-3 of project implementation, a special study will be commissioned to assess options and make&#13;
recommendations for future action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
3.15   Ecotourism. Tourism could provide a source of revenue towards Park maintenance costs as&#13;
well as alternative livelihood opportunity for some village communities. At present KSNP offers&#13;
very little facilities and services to attract any type of ecotourism. In addition, experience from&#13;
other tropical forest habitats in Asia suggest that ecotourism potential is limited, unless it is&#13;
accompanied by other attractions. This need for additional attractions would be considered in the&#13;
framework of the preparation of the spatial plan (para. 4.3). At the same time the project, with&#13;
additional support from technical assistance provided for under the Park management component,&#13;
would undertake a study to assess the potentials and constraints for KSNP to become an ecotourism&#13;
site. If a real potential would exist for KSNP and depending on the type of ecotourist (e.g. budget&#13;
and time available) the study would also outline how the ecotourism would have to be organized and&#13;
managed, including the roles of the local people, govemment and the private sector.&#13;
3.16   Kubu Assistance Plan. The Kubu or Orang Rimba (people of the forest) have a tradition of&#13;
nomadic rain forest foraging, the only traditional hunter-gatherers to be found on mainland Sumatra.&#13;
They generally are distributed outside the Park throughout the Batang Hari and Musi drainage basins&#13;
but they have begun to venture into the KSNP buffer zone, particularly in or near the forest&#13;
concessions because of the continuing depletion of their traditional forest resources. While the&#13;
Kubus' livelihood is mainly derived from a combination of swidden cultivation, harvesting non-&#13;
timber forest products and hunting and trapping, the overall depletion of resources has also led to an&#13;
increase in commercial hunting and trapping of many rare and threatened animals in and around&#13;
Kerinci Seblat because of lucrative prices paid by middlemen. The information on the Kubu and&#13;
possible development actions are described in Working Paper 8 of Annex 14.&#13;
3.17   Preliminary surveys indicate that there may be as few as two to three families to as many as&#13;
several hundred Orang Rimba living in the buffer zone of the Park. While the Kubu are not likely to&#13;
suffer any adverse effects from the proposed project other than that the project will enforce standard&#13;
legal provisions against poaching of wildlife (especially endangered wildlife) for commercial&#13;
purposes, the project will review the actual Kubu dependence on buffer zone and KSNP resources&#13;
and based on this impact assessment will prepare, if required, a plan which will propose measures to&#13;
continue the continued access of the Kubus to natural resources vital to their subsistence and&#13;
livelihood in a manner to be acceptable to them, but within the constraints of a sustainable&#13;
management of KSNP and its buffer zone. If deemed necessary selected pilot activities among Kubu&#13;
groups, possibly in the field of health improvements and education, would be initiated under the&#13;
project.&#13;
3.18   Because of the Kubus' highly mobile nature and their tendency to range in small groups over&#13;
an enormous territory, it appears that a two step approach may be the most appropriate means to&#13;
further assist them. The first step would include a 2-3 year review process carried out by the project&#13;
and mainly dealing with:&#13;
*  establishing and training of a small multidisciplinary team consisting of both NGO and&#13;
government to effectively communicate with the Kubu and act as interlocutors between&#13;
the Kubu and the district and provincial government officials;&#13;
*  the collection by the team of more basic baseline information on what-where Kubu&#13;
presence, and dependence on resources in buffer zone and Park, including ecological and&#13;
socio-economic impact assessments;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
*  determining Kubu livelihood and resource needs through an action plan in the event that&#13;
partial or full restrictions on resource utilization or access exist for the Kubu in the Park&#13;
and buffer zones;&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that (a) not later than September 30, 1998, the results of&#13;
the baseline study and impact assessment would be sent to the Bank for comments; (b) based on the&#13;
results of the study and of the assessment, and taking into account the KSNP management plan, the&#13;
land zoning plan for the project area, and the comments of the Bank on the baseline study and&#13;
impact assessment, prepare, not later than June 1, 1999, an action plan designed to ensure that the&#13;
Orang Rimba do not suffer adverse effects as a result of the implementation of the above plans; and&#13;
(c) promptly thereafter, carry out such action plan in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
C. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.19   The total cost of the project, summarized in Table 3.1, is estimated at US$46.0 million&#13;
(Rp.103.6 billion equivalent), inclusive of taxes and duties in the amount of US$3.7 million&#13;
(Rp.10.1 billion). Foreign exchange costs amount to about US$9.4 million or 20 percent of total&#13;
costs. Physical contingencies are based on an average amount of 5 percent for goods and services,&#13;
except for village allocations which are excluded from physical contingencies due to their&#13;
programmatic nature. Price contingencies reflect foreign inflation of 2.4 percent per annum and&#13;
local inflation of 8.7 percent per annum throughout the project period. The local inflation rate has&#13;
been adjusted to take account of expected dollar appreciation against the Rupiah since most costs are&#13;
dollar-based. Total contingencies are estimated at US$5.0 million or 11 percent of total costs.&#13;
Further details of project costs are presented in Annex 9.&#13;

3.20   The financing plan in Table 3.2 presents the GEF, Bank and GOI contribution over the six&#13;
year project period. The Bank Loan of US$19.1 million equivalent, combined with a GEF Grant of&#13;
SDR 10.2 million, would finance about 74 percent of project costs or 81 % of project costs exclusive&#13;
of taxes, duties, vehicles and fertilizers which would be purchased by GOI. The GEF grant would&#13;
finance the incremental costs of the proposed project to conserve the unique global biodiversity in&#13;
the KSNP, and would be- targeted to elements of the project that contribute wholly or largely to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
achievement of global biodiversity objectives (47 percent of total foreign costs and 32 percent of&#13;
local costs). The detailed incremental cost analysis (with information on the costs of the baseline&#13;
scenario and GEF alternative) is presented in Annex 12. The proposed Bank loan would finance 38&#13;
percent of foreign costs and about 47 percent of local costs. The balance of project costs, covering&#13;
1 5 percent of foreign costs and 20 percent of local costs, or a total of US$11.8 million equivalent,&#13;
including taxes, would be financed by GOI.&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1   The overall organization of the project is shown in Chart 1. The three main interventions,&#13;
i.e. Park management, area/village development and concession management for biodiversity would&#13;
each be managed by a project manager (PIMPRO) responsible for contracting services,&#13;
implementing activities and preparing reports.  The PIMPRO  for the Park Management&#13;
component will be appointed by the DG PHPA and be responsible to the KSNP Park manager and&#13;
be based in Park headquarters in Sungai Penuh (see map). The Park manager will be supported by a&#13;
project-financed Technical Advisory Group and a Management Support Unit which will assist him&#13;
with annual planning, financial management, monitoring and reporting. Staff of the Forestry&#13;
Ministry's provincial offices (Kanwil Kehutanan) in Jambi and Bengkulu will be assigned as&#13;
PIMPROs for the Concession Management for Biodiversity component. They will be responsible&#13;
for activity implementation, and report directly through the Kanwil's office to the Project&#13;
Management Committee (PMC). Field activities will be under the supervision of the Dinas&#13;
Kehutanan TK II in the Kabupaten which have concession areas identified for project activities. In&#13;
line with the further devolution of responsibility for local development planning and implementation&#13;
and in support of the KSNP management program, implementation of the Area/Village&#13;
Development component will be devolved to organized village community groups through the&#13;
LKMD. These village groups will be assisted by resident facilitators and the visiting TA team&#13;
working in coordination with sub-district extension workers to plan and implement the component&#13;
activities. The planning and implementation of village infrastructure investments will follow the&#13;
general guidelines outlined in the technical manual prepared for the Village Infrastructure Project&#13;
(Ln. 3888-IND). The component will be coordinated in each of the Kabupatens by a district&#13;
committee chaired by the head of BAPPEDA TK II with a PIMPRO pointed from the same office as&#13;
the secretary. A similar Provincial Coordinating Committee chaired by the BAPPEDA TK I with&#13;
the PIMPRO TK I as secretary will ensure district project plans are incorporated into the improved&#13;
provincial spatial plans being prepared with assistance from the project planners. The Park director&#13;
will take overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation System. His office will establish a "base" for the information system. Each of the&#13;
agencies responsible for implementing components (BAPPEDAS and Kanwils Kehutanan) will be&#13;
strengthened with a "subset" of the overall project monitoring system.&#13;
4.2   The inter-provincial project coordination will be achieved through an Inter-Provincial&#13;
Coordinating Committee (IPCC) with membership incorporating all project PIMPROs drawn from&#13;
the BAPPEDAS in each participating province and district and from the Forestry Ministry's&#13;
provincial offices. The IPCC will be responsible for ensuring that the Park management plan and&#13;
the various district and provincial plans are coordinated into an overall land zoning plan for the Park&#13;
and surrounding areas, and that the annual series of planned activities and budget proposals are&#13;
integrated and consistent with other component objectives and overall project goals.  The&#13;
chairmanship of the IPPC will rotate through the four provinces and will be serviced by a project&#13;
secretariat maintained by each province. Meetings will be chaired by the Head BAPPEDA TK I of&#13;
the host province while the Park manager will be the committee's permanent secretary. In addition,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
there is an overall National Steering Committee covering all ICDPs, chaired by the National&#13;
Planning Board (BAPPENAS), with members representing the Ministries of Finance, Home Affairs,&#13;
Agriculture, Forestry, National Land Agency, the four Governors, the Indonesian Institute of&#13;
Sciences and representatives of national environmental NGOs. A working group will be attached to&#13;
this Committee to review project performance and deal with policies, laws and regulations,&#13;
particularly those "perverse" incentives that discourage conservation.&#13;
4.3    The "greater" KSNP land zoning plan (para 3.11) should be completed by September 30,&#13;
1998, including recommendations for the long-term management plan for KSNP. Assurances to this&#13;
effect were obtained at negotiations. It is intended as a tool to get the four provinces to endorse the&#13;
final zonation plan for KSNP and its surrounding districts, including commitment to what the plan&#13;
deems necessary for the further integration of biodiversity conservation and development in and&#13;
around the Park. Particularly the environmental, land use (e.g. roads and mining) and socio-&#13;
economic impact implications of KSNP have to be addressed and inter-provincial issues need to be&#13;
resolved. Assurances were also obtained at negotiations that GOI not later than June 1, 1999, would&#13;
review the land zoning plan for the project area, and, thereafter, carry out the recommendations of&#13;
such review, taking into account the comments of the Bank. Both the IPCC as well as the national&#13;
steering committee will review the 'greater" KSNP land zoning plan, in time for the project's Mid-&#13;
Term-Review.&#13;
4.4    Technical Assistance (TA) The project involves the introduction of many new conservation&#13;
techniques and processes that are still not very well known in Indonesia. To ensure effective&#13;
technology and managerial transfer and train and build institutional capacity, the project has&#13;
included some 1,300 staff-months of short and long-term local and foreign experts, including NGOs.&#13;
About 82 percent of the TA is for the support for operational activities and institutional development&#13;
of which 60 percent is expected to be carried out by local and 40 percent by foreign consultants. The&#13;
remainder of TA (18 percent) is set aside for studies and research. Details are described&#13;
in Annex 5. The TA is provided to cover the following main fields:&#13;
(a)    Park management and enforcement;&#13;
(b)    village land use and development planning and community based implementation;&#13;
(c)   regional and spatial planning;&#13;
(d)    concession management for biodiversity and inspection audits;&#13;
(e)    monitoring and evaluation; and&#13;
(f)    studies and research.&#13;
4.5    Most experts to be located in Sungai Penuh will provide support to the areas in Jambi and&#13;
West Sumatra, whereas the TA team to be located in Curup (see map) will provide support to&#13;
villages and districts in Bengkulu and South Sumatra. Assistance from both local and foreign NGOs&#13;
will also be provided. Particularly in the village planning and implementation process of the&#13;
area/village development component, they are one of the most valuable resources for the project.&#13;
The terms of reference for the key technical assistance assignments are summarized in Annex 14 D.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
4.6    Annual Plan Preparation and Fund Flow. The Project Managers of the Park Development&#13;
and Concession Management for Biodiversity components will prepare the annual budget plans&#13;
(DUPs) and funds will be made available when annual plan proposals have been approved (DIPs) by&#13;
BAPPENAS and DG BUDGET. Funds released for the AreaNVillages Development component will&#13;
basically conform to the specific grant of DATI II (see Chart 2). The SPABP will go to the PIMPRO&#13;
in BAPPEDA TK II through KPKN. The PIMPRO will make the request to BRI to finance the&#13;
village community project. The village community group assisted by the TA team will prepare an&#13;
annual contract, according to the approved village development plan, with the appropriate district&#13;
PIMPRO. The annual village development contract would be approved by the Camat before&#13;
submission to the PIMPRO. The village community group will receive funds from BRI Unit Desa at&#13;
Kecamatan to meet the expenditures. The PIMPRO accounts for BRI's expenditures incurred on the&#13;
basis of the PIMPRO's request to KPKN to replenishment to BRI. This replenishment to BRI, being&#13;
reimbursement of expenditures incurred, is paid from the Special Account. The leaders of each&#13;
community group will be assisted by the accountant from the village development council (LKMD)&#13;
to manage and account for the funds released to them. They will also be supervised and trained by&#13;
the facilitators and the TA team. The annual work-plan will be prepared by the Kabupaten PIMPROs&#13;
of the area/village development component, based on participatory planning at the village-level to&#13;
produce project proposals. These proposals will be screened by the Kabupaten and Provincial&#13;
Guidance teams before they are forwarded to BAPPENAS and DG BUDGET.&#13;
4.7   Training. The overall objective of project-related training is to develop skills and institutional&#13;
capacity to implement ICDP activities by implementing agencies. Training plays a large part in the&#13;
Park management component, where the focus is on building Park management skills, community&#13;
awareness and extension skills and familiarizing Park staff and communities of the biodiversity within&#13;
KSNP. In the area/village development component the focus is primarily in improving integration&#13;
between biodiversity conservation and rural development through integrated planning and community-&#13;
based program planning exercises. Training will also focus on improved biodiversity monitoring and&#13;
development impact specifically through training of forestry personnel in concession audit techniques.&#13;
Table 4.1 illustrates the different types of training to be financed through the project. The project&#13;
proposes to deliver nearly 802 staff-months of training through short-courses at the provincial, district,&#13;
and sub-district level. Ir addition, the project will support four Park management staff to attend&#13;
overseas short training course on Park Management, and seven staff to visit Malaysian National Parks&#13;
on working visits to learn ICDP management techniques being implemented in Kota Kinabalu National&#13;
Park. PHPA staff will also visit other National Parks currently implementing ICDP types of projects&#13;
within Indonesia. Prior to implementing training activities, each component will first conduct a&#13;
training needs assessment.&#13;

B. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
4.8   Implementation Schedule The project will be implemented over six years. A project&#13;
implementation schedule, showing the key events of project implementation for the first two years&#13;
has been prepared. Details are summarized in Annex 6. In general there are three key steps for&#13;
project start-up implementation:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(a)  the preparation of the decrees (Surat Keputusan-SK) concerning the appointments of&#13;
the PIMPROs, coordinating teams/committees and 1996/7 budgets, which have to be&#13;
prepared by GOI;&#13;
(b)   the preparation and processing of procurement of the project's technical assistance&#13;
program so that the TA and NGO teams can be mobilized immediately; and&#13;
(c)   the completion of Park boundary demarcation.&#13;
4.9    With respect to the Park Management component, little project action can be expected&#13;
before the appointment by the Secretary DG PHPA of the senior Park staff. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that not later than August 1, 1996 a KSNP project management unit, with&#13;
competent staff and in adequate numbers, would be established and thereafter be maintained until&#13;
project completion. Concerning the Area/Village Development component it would be important&#13;
to have the resident village facilitators (pendamping) for the first ten villages selected, trained and in&#13;
place by July 1996. The meeting of this deadline is possible as the training and pre-planning&#13;
activities for the ten villages by WWF were started in November 1995, with funds provided by the&#13;
Japanese Grant (para. 3.3).  With respect to the Concession Management for Biodiversity&#13;
component, there is a need to commence the rapid ecological assessments in the concession&#13;
forthwith so that biodiversity management zones in the concessions and along the Park boundary&#13;
can be identified (see para. 5.12).&#13;
4.10   During appraisal a list of draft monitoring and performance indicators to be used over the life&#13;
of the project was developed and which should be finalized during the first year of implementation&#13;
once key staff are in place and key TA personnel are mobilized. The Project's supervision&#13;
requirements are summarized in Annex 7. While the project would carry out yearly reviews on&#13;
progress and if required, would make appropriate adjustments during the project cycle, a MTR will&#13;
be completed by March 1, 1999. The MTR report would be prepared under terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. The MTR will review project effectiveness in meeting ICDP goals and in&#13;
stabilizing Park boundaries and reducing biodiversity loss. It will also be used for making&#13;
appropriate technology and institutional adjustments in project design if required, including follow-&#13;
up actions for the "greater" KSNP land zoning plan (para. 4.3) and Kubu action plan (para. 3.18).&#13;
The MTR report will be reviewed with the Bank by June 1, 1999 and thereafter GOI would take all&#13;
measures to ensure the efficient completion of the project based on the conclusions and&#13;
recommendations of the MTR report, and taking into account the views of the Bank. A project&#13;
completion report would be prepared by the Ministry of Forestry on the basis of Bank guidelines&#13;
within six months of the closing date of the loan and grant. Assurances regarding the above were&#13;
obtained at negotiations.&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.11 The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.1 and reviewed below. Goods&#13;
and Works would be procured in accordance with the provisions of the "Guidelines for the&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", dated January, 1995, and revised in January,&#13;
1996. The DG of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation (MoFr) will be responsible for&#13;
coordinating the procurement activities related to the Park Management component, the DG for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Forest Utilization (MoFr) will do so for the Concession Management for Biodiversity component&#13;
and the DG of Regional Development (BANGDA) in MoHA will be responsible for the&#13;
Area/Village Development and M&amp;E components. Since the consulting services required for this&#13;
project are quite large and interrelated between the various components it will be BAPPENAS who&#13;
will coordinate the initial.procurement process of these services. GOI would finance purchases of&#13;
vehicles and fertilizer from its own resources because under GO] procurement rules these items are&#13;
not open for intemational competitive bidding. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that such a&#13;
procurement will be in accordance with schedules agreed with the Bank.&#13;

4.12   Civil works (US$8.1 million) would comprise buildings and village infrastructure. The&#13;
works for small offices and other buildings would involve small contracts over scattered areas which&#13;
would not attract foreign bidders. These works would be procured following national competitive&#13;
bidding procedures (NCB) acceptable to the Bank. Civil works for village infrastructure (US$5.8&#13;
million) would be small sub-projects between US$10,000-40,000 in often very remote areas. These&#13;
works would be carried out mostly by the LKMDs by direct village labor (community participation)&#13;
or by lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three&#13;
qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation, with implementation agreements&#13;
with the Kabupaten Department of Public Works. Agricultural and other inputs (US$1.5 million)&#13;
would consist of planting materials, labor, small tools, and other goods required by small enterprises.&#13;
Inputs also include fertilizers valued at about US$0.07 million and not financed by the Loan/Grant.&#13;
These inputs would make up the bulk of the farm or community forest treatments and spread over a&#13;
large number of areas and farms in and around the Park buffer zone. The size of each input would&#13;
be too small (on average less than US$15,000) to attract international or national competitive&#13;
bidders. They would, th-erefore, be procured under national procedures acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
mostly through national shopping and with at least three price quotations. Vehicles (US$1.0&#13;
million) are considered reserved procurement and would not be financed by the Loan or Grant.&#13;
Office and field equipment (US$1.4 million) would be mainly for small packages or items below&#13;
US$200,000 and be procured under NCB acceptable to the Bank and with at least three price&#13;
quotations. For small items that cannot be conveniently packaged under NCB in amounts not&#13;
exceeding US$20,000 per contract up to a aggregate of US$70,000, national shopping procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank would be used. Aerial photographs would be procured through NCB&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank as this would be for packages between US$50,000-100,000 for&#13;
which capable domestic companies are available and which would be too low to attract interest by&#13;
international companies. Satellite imagery would, with the Bank's prior agreement, be procured by&#13;
direct contracting as this would only be available from either Spot or Landsat. Training (US$3.4&#13;
million), of which about US$0.3 million would not be financed by the Loan/Grant, would be carried&#13;
out by procedures acceptable to the Bank. Extension and Planning (US$6.1 million) would be&#13;
procured by national shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank. Consultancy Services, Studies&#13;
and Surveys and Research (US$18.3 million) would be procured in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for Use of Consultants. For complex, time-bound assignments, contracts would be based&#13;
on the standard form of contract for consultants'services issued by the Bank. The project's TA&#13;
requirements would be coordinated by an independent Project Coordination consultant attached to&#13;
PHPA but responsible to the KS-ICDP working group of the Project Steering Committee. An NGO&#13;
as a sole sourced contract would carry out the village participation operations of the area/village&#13;
development component. It is likely that WWF would be chosen on account of their long&#13;
involvement with villages in KSNP. The balance of project costs are Incremental Operational&#13;
Costs (US$6.0 million), most of which (US$4.3 million) would not be financed by the loan/Grant.&#13;
About US$ 1.7 million would be procured following the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants.&#13;
4.13   Procurement Review.  All contracts for goods would be grouped into bid packages&#13;
whenever possible to attract competition and permit bulk purchasing. GOI would use and conform&#13;
to the Bank's standard Bidding documents i.e. procurement of goods and works, including works for&#13;
smaller contracts, which would facilitate the tender and contract preparation by the various agencies&#13;
involved. Civil works' contracts for offices and other buildings, equivalent to US$500,000, or more,&#13;
would be subject to the Bank's prior review. Given their small amounts and their large number, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
need for quick approval and the safeguards in project design (field engineers and other TA will be in&#13;
place to assist) to supervise the process, the contracts for village infrastructure, except for the first&#13;
five contracts, would not require prior review. All tender documents and contracts for goods,&#13;
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more would be reviewed by the Bank, including&#13;
the first contract. All contracts for consultants' services, including studies, surveys and research,&#13;
valued at US$100,000 or more for engagement of firms and US$50,000 or more for engagement of&#13;
individuals would be subject to prior review by the Bank. The exceptions to prior review of&#13;
contracts for consultants'services would not apply to: (a) the terms of reference for such contracts;&#13;
(b) single-source selection of consulting firms; (c) assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably&#13;
determined by the Bank; (d) amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising&#13;
the contract value to US$100,000 equivalent or more; and (e) amendments to contracts for the&#13;
employment of individual consultants raising the contract value to US$50,000 or more. This would&#13;
result in prior review of about 55 percent of all contracts procured. Contracts below the threshold&#13;
levels would be subject to selective post-review by visiting missions.  This review would&#13;
concentrate, among others, on the competitiveness of prices paid and on the physical inspection of&#13;
the inputs provided. Assurances were obtained from GOI at negotiations that these procurement&#13;
arrangements would be followed.&#13;
D. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.14   The Bank loan of US$19.1 million and a GEF grant of SDR 10.2 million (about US$15.0&#13;
million equivalent) are expected to be disbursed over a six-year period. The period of disbursement&#13;
is less than the disbursement profile for agricultural projects in Indonesia. However, with the pre-&#13;
implementation activities now taking place in the buffer zone and a dynamic Park Director already&#13;
present, it is believed that the targets should be achieved during the project period provided that the&#13;
technical assistance team can be mobilized promptly. The project loan and grant closing dates are&#13;
September 30, 2002. The proposed Loan and Grant allocation and a summary of estimated&#13;
disbursements by year is presented in Annex 10. Disbursements of the Bank loan would be made on&#13;
the following basis:&#13;
(a)   80% of expenditures for civil works for area/village development;&#13;
(b)    100% of foreign expenditures, 100 % of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 65%&#13;
for other items procured locally for equipment, furniture and mapping materials;&#13;
(c)   80% of expenditures for agricultural and other inputs, excluding fertilizers;&#13;
(d)   60% of expenditures for training;&#13;
(e)   80% of expenditures for planning and extension activities related to buffer zone&#13;
development;&#13;
(f)   80% of expenditures for technical assistance.;&#13;
(g)   90% of expenditures for studies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
(h)    30% of expenditures for surveys; and&#13;
(i)    15% of incremental operating expenditures related to the buffer zone.&#13;
4.15   Disbursements of the Grant would be made as follows:&#13;
(a)    60% of expenditures for civil works in the Park;&#13;
(b)    100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 65%&#13;
for other items procured locally for equipment, furniture and mapping materials;&#13;
(c)    90% and 20% respectively of expenditures for Park and buffer zone related training;&#13;
(d)    80% and 10% respectively of expenditures for planning and extension activities related&#13;
to Park and buffer zone development;&#13;
(e)    90% and 50% respectively of expenditures for surveys and research related to Park and&#13;
buffer zone;&#13;
(f)    90% on expenditures for technical assistance related to Park and NGO Services; and&#13;
10% for TA related to buffer zone development, excluding NGO Services; and&#13;
(g)    15% for incremental operating expenditures related to the Park.&#13;
4.16   For disbursement purposes, full documentation will be required for all contracts at or&#13;
exceeding the following amounts: (a) for civil works US$500,000 and the first five contracts related&#13;
to village infrastructure; (b) for goods US$200,000 and the first contract of both the loan and the&#13;
grant; (c) for consulting services' contracts, including studies, surveys and research, with firms&#13;
US$100,000; and (d) for consulting services'contracts, including studies, surveys and research, with&#13;
individuals US$50,000. For all expenditure in those categories below the limits specified and for&#13;
expenditures on training, agricultural inputs, extension and planning, and incremental operating&#13;
expenditures, disbursements will be made on the basis of certified statements of expenditures&#13;
(SOEs). SOE for village infrastructure works will be supported by progress reports certified by the&#13;
Camat (head sub-district). This documentation will be available for the required audit and also to&#13;
Bank supervision missions.&#13;
4.17   To expedite disbursements, two Special Accounts would be opened in an amount of US$1.8&#13;
million and US$1.5 million respectively for the Loan and the Grant by GOI in Bank Indonesia, or at&#13;
a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank for the purpose of the project. This account should be&#13;
maintained by the Directorate General of Budget and would be used for all eligible foreign and local&#13;
currency expenditures. Replenishment to the Special Accounts will be made on a monthly basis, or&#13;
when 20 percent of the Special Accounts' balance have been used, whichever comes first.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
E. PROJECT ACCOUNTS, AUDITS, REPORTING AND BANK SUPERVISION&#13;
4.18   Separate detailed accounts would be kept by the provincial project and program offices, for&#13;
each budget under their charge by sub-project and project year. Project accounts are subject to two&#13;
audits by: (a) the Inspector General of concerned ministries; and (b) the Financial and Development&#13;
Supervisory Board (BPKP). The work of both auditors has generally been found satisfactory on&#13;
Bank-assisted projects. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the project records and&#13;
accounts, including the Special Account, would be audited for each fiscal year and furnished to the&#13;
Bank within six months of each Government fiscal year. Such audit would also contain a separate&#13;
opinion on the SOEs. In addition, all project related contracts, documents related to the SOEs, and&#13;
orders and receipts, would be kept for at least one year after the Bank has received the audit report&#13;
for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the loan and or grant account was made.&#13;
Annual financial audits would include at least 10 percent coverage of randomly selected village&#13;
infrastructure sub-projects.&#13;
4.19   An annual work program outlining the proposed activities and budget would be submitted to&#13;
the Bank by no later than October 15. The MIS developed and improved under the project would&#13;
review the reporting mechanisms and update them through to the national level, as well as the&#13;
BAPPEDA offices at district and provincial levels. Annual progress reports on each separate&#13;
component will be prepared by the appropriate PIMPRO but with a consolidated project summary&#13;
prepared by the Park manager (information data base will be located in the Park management office&#13;
in Sungai Penuh) would be submitted to the Bank no later than June 30 each year and would also&#13;
elaborate on the constraints and problem solving aspects of the project.&#13;
4.20   The above progress reports will also reflect the monitoring of key performance indicators of&#13;
the various project components. The Performance Indicators (both implementation and impact) for&#13;
each project component would be finalized during the first year of implementation once key staff are&#13;
in place and key TA personnel have been mobilized and had time to review and update their work&#13;
program and TORs. Key indicators are discussed in Annex 8. The project would be supervised&#13;
according to a supervision plan summarized in Annex 7 and priority would be given during the three&#13;
launching workshops in the first project year to institutional arrangements (e.g. project&#13;
coordination), to review first year work program and TORs and to get full agreement on the project&#13;
indicators among the various project units. While this plan is likely to be modified as the project&#13;
becomes fully operational, the plan suggests that regular supervision be carried out by RSI, with&#13;
specialized project reviews to be coordinated by Bank HQ, including the milestone missions. Three&#13;
milestone supervision missions would have to be undertaken by the Bank and GOI, namely (a) first&#13;
year launching workshops: project start-up, after TA mobilization, and after end of full&#13;
implementation year to review project component indicators and to review suggestions for project&#13;
adjustments; (b) MTR, particularly to review KSNP land zoning plan, including social and&#13;
environmental impacts and Kubu development follow-up; and (c) implementation completion&#13;
mission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
5. PROJECT IMPACT&#13;
5.1   The project would benefit some I to 1.5 million people living in the thirty-six sub-districts&#13;
surrounding the Kerinci Seblat National Park, both directly as a result of specific income generating&#13;
investments made under the project, and indirectly as a result of improved soil and water quality&#13;
delivery resulting from better protection of forested areas in and around the Park. The project would&#13;
generate the following benefits:&#13;
(a)    environmental benefits, including protection of unique biodiverse habitats and rare&#13;
and endemic species native to Kerinci Seblat for current and future generations and&#13;
improved watershed protection for the four surrounding provinces. More specifically&#13;
the project would reduce negative environmental impacts of local people on&#13;
biodiversity and increase a better appreciation of protected areas and the social and&#13;
economic benefits accruing from conservation. Downstream soil and water impacts&#13;
of stabilizing the Park area and forest cover in neighboring forest concessions are&#13;
likely to be significant, given the high density of population and intensity of land use&#13;
on lowland areas of Sumatra affected by erosion of watersheds;&#13;
(b)   socio-economic  benefits by  improved  employment and  income  generation&#13;
opportunities for poor households and communities living in Park boundary villages&#13;
by giving them more control over the long-term management of their resource base,&#13;
including resolution of land use conflicts.  More specifically about 13,400&#13;
households, considered to be the poorer sections in the four provinces, would directly&#13;
benefit from the investment funds availability to the 134 villages communities and&#13;
some 300,000 households would indirectly benefit through improved biodiversity&#13;
conservation. The project would ensure participation of women, tribal communities&#13;
and other disadvantaged people in community decisions about resource distribution&#13;
and investment selection in both the National Park and buffer zone; and&#13;
(c)   the capability of institutions would be enhanced through  human resource&#13;
development, strengthening of sector institutions and policy reform. More&#13;
specifically the project would improve Park and buffer zone management, through an&#13;
improved spatial/regional planning process and policy and regulatory framework,&#13;
including enforcement and a more participatory role of village communities. It&#13;
would provide an innovative pilot model, which if successful, could be replicated in&#13;
other conservation areas in Indonesia.&#13;
A. ECONOMIC BENEFITS&#13;
5.2    Given the nature of this project, it has been difficult to quantify the benefits. As a result,&#13;
varying degrees of precision can be attached to estimates made for the various components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
5.3    With respect to the biodiversity value of the Park, the Project Preparation Study (Report 8 on&#13;
Resource Economics-Annex 14) concluded that "the value of KSNP as a conservation estate is likely&#13;
to be similar to the opportunity cost (of timber harvest) in the worst case scenario and that there is a&#13;
potentially large economic gain to be achieved in the best case scenario". The benefits of KSNP&#13;
investments are very broad, and many of them are also long term. Such benefits can be difficult to&#13;
estimate directly, particularly because there is not yet a generally accepted method in the&#13;
environmental economics literature on how to estimate these. In the case of biodiversity and&#13;
conservation benefits associated with KSNP, the net present value of selected benefits has been&#13;
estimated ranging from US$70 to US$200 million, with the mid-point being US$135 million. The&#13;
costs of achieving these can be calculated by adding the direct investment costs involved, to the&#13;
value of logging benefits foregone in this forested area. In this case these costs were estimated at&#13;
about US$93 million.&#13;
5.4    At the same time, the investments in Park Management and the planned activities in the&#13;
buffer zones are a sine-qua-non for maintaining the integrity of the Park. Many of the large predators&#13;
and forest herbivores require large areas of forests for food and to maintain viable populations. This&#13;
sets a minimum threshold to Park size and, correspondingly, to investment in management and&#13;
monitoring. Similarly, once the Park area is defined, then stabilization in the entire zone buffering&#13;
that Park is necessary. It seems that the proposed level of investments of about US$13.2 million for&#13;
Park Management and other components of US$34.0 million form a minimum amount that would&#13;
safeguard the biodiversity value of the Park. With respect to the cost recovery of these investments&#13;
and the Park's future recurrent cost financing, since the project's benefits are mainly long-term and&#13;
indirect in nature, the project will carry out studies to find an effective mechanism to ensure long-&#13;
term recurrent cost financing of KSNP, particularly since few effective measures presently exist&#13;
(para. 3.14). It is believed that the fiscal implications of continued Park management beyond the life&#13;
of this project are not large, and are well within the budgetary capability of GOI to cover.&#13;
5.5    With respect to the village infrastructure investments (e.g. upgrading village roads, drinking&#13;
and irrigation water), employment and cash compensation to village laborers is an important feature&#13;
of the project. The cash to be earned under the project should provide an important addition to the&#13;
poorer household budgets. Labor-intensive methods are also efficient for the public budget.&#13;
Villagers are willing to work for the equivalent of about Rp 4-5,000/day (e.g. share rubber tapper),&#13;
and at those costs labor intensive methods are competitive with capital intensive methods for the&#13;
simple type of works envisaged, particularly for the relatively isolated villages in the Park's buffer&#13;
zone. The villagers have generally to undertake the maintenance of the village facilities. However,&#13;
having participated in the construction and because it is for their own benefit it is likely they would&#13;
do the maintenance themselves. Assuming that rural roads increase farmers' income by 10 percent,&#13;
due to better access to markets in the rainy season, easier access to employment, health and other&#13;
services outside the village (see: Yogyakarta Upland Development Project; 3305-[ND) and using&#13;
data on buffer zone villages in the KSNP Project gives an economic rate of return for rural roads of&#13;
37 percent. With respect to the village development in the Park buffer zone, the communities&#13;
commitment to Park protection and to improvement of the management of the natural resources&#13;
they utilize, will to a large extent determine the project's success to meet above objective. Since&#13;
most of the resource management decisions of these generally isolated villages are motivated by&#13;
varying combinations of family needs for livelihood, local knowledge and customs, topography and&#13;
climate, including a wide array of external factors, the interaction with the environment represents&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
for each of these villages an unique set of resource management and community development&#13;
opportunities and constraints. Hence, critical decisions into possible changes in village landuse and&#13;
resource management will be made with each target village through a participatory process of&#13;
planning and implementation. This process would be iterative, flexible and responsive to each&#13;
community's particular situation and development requirements.&#13;
5.6   Individual farmer benefits in newly agreed land use activities to be brought about by the&#13;
village and Park zonation plans are difficult to quantify. The proposed changes in land use within&#13;
the Park will be mainly governed by achieving more optimum "conservation" principles, with&#13;
community benefits as a secondary objective and mainly comprising "security of access to certain&#13;
subsistence resource uses in the Park". The effectiveness of introducing land use changes in the&#13;
village buffer zone will mainly depend on the financial attractiveness for the target group compared&#13;
to the activities it is already engaged in. There is a huge variety of farming systems in the buffer&#13;
zone determined by a wide variation in plot and farming size, soils (volcanic and podzolic) and soil&#13;
depth, elevation (0-2,000 m), rainfall (2,000-5,000 mm/year) and proximity of markets and input&#13;
supplies. The project intends to bring about improved land use changes in these farming systems&#13;
according to a menu of indicative principles rather than a clearly described menu of packages. Some&#13;
of the indicative principles are: (a) emphasis on tree crops and existing farming systems; (b) work on&#13;
factors which improve securing of markets and input supplies (e.g. coffee, cinnamon and rubber&#13;
have well established market structures; one of the main limiting factors to increased productivity is&#13;
the small amount of phosphorous available in the podzolic soils); (c) return on labor; and (d)&#13;
improvement and availability of planting material. At the same time there are clearly highly&#13;
profitable improvements in certain farning areas, the project could instantly introduce (e.g. in the SE&#13;
part of the project area where jungle rubber provides the main cash crop and where farmers are less&#13;
well off, the introduction of improved varieties with either budded stumps or polyclonal seed for&#13;
remote areas, could more than double the yields).&#13;
5.7    As part of project preparation, a study was carried out for various farming systems to&#13;
calculate the economic rate of return for agriculture investment under the village grants. The ERR&#13;
for jungle rubber is estimated to be 40 percent, for cassiavera (cinnamon), 60-90 percent, depending&#13;
on the bark grade and for oil palm, 35 percent. Also, on the basis of incremental benefits for&#13;
agroforestry on 3,720 ha in the buffer zone, an ERR of 34 percent has been estimated. Additionally,&#13;
as part of the project preparation study, incremental benefit calculations have been carried out for&#13;
irrigation intensification. These involve investments in an area of 930 ha spread out over sixty-two&#13;
villages. The economic rate of return is estimated to be 53 percent. It should be made clear that the&#13;
benefits of these direct investments in agricultural productivity are incremental to the benefits from&#13;
investments in infrastructure, discussed in para 5.5.&#13;
5.8.   The village/area development component is both the largest item of expenditure under the&#13;
project and the one most directly related to social development and income improvement for&#13;
communities, in the project area. It accounts for 57 percent of total base costs. Therefore, it is&#13;
necessary to provide an overall rate of return for this component. Because of the difficulty of&#13;
estimating specific activity returns, given that both the infrastructure requirements and agriculture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
land use options in each village are as yet unknown (para. 3.5), an ERR of 34 percent is considered&#13;
representative for infrastructure and agriculture without inclusion of all TA and overheads - this&#13;
being the lower end of the range of returns discussed in paras 5.5-5.7 above. Once all costs of&#13;
component overheads and associated TA are added in for the village/area development component&#13;
an ERR of 16 percent for this component results.&#13;
5. 9   Sensitivity analysis. The major risk would consist of an inadequate consultation process&#13;
with target communities with the result that not all villages would participate in the village&#13;
conservation agreement process (para 3.5).  Assuming that 20 percent of villages would not&#13;
participate, this would result in an ERR of 13 percent. Other likely scenario would be for the project&#13;
to be delayed by one year due to delay in NGO and other technical assistance mobilization or for the&#13;
project to receive reduced incremental benefits, say by 10 percent These outcomes would correspond&#13;
to reduced ERRs of 12 percent and 13 percent respectively. This project component is therefore&#13;
relatively insensitive to these major categories of risks and maintains an acceptable return.&#13;
5.10   In respect to the economic benefits derived from a better monitoring in the forestry&#13;
concessions bordering the Park, an ERR of some 15 percent has been estimated. This calculation is&#13;
based on the approach taken in a paper on the economics of sustainable forest management which&#13;
was presented to GOI in September 1995 and assumes that adequate protection of the regenerating&#13;
stands produced from project activities can be maintained. The economic calculations prepared for&#13;
two main project components (area/village development and integrating biodiversity in forest&#13;
concession management) are given in Annex 13.&#13;
B. SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS&#13;
5.11   The project is expected to have a highly beneficial environmental impact. The main goal of&#13;
the project is the protection of the approximately 1.3 million ha of the Kerinci Seblat National Park&#13;
and the surrounding buffer zone. The project has extensive environmental, land use and socio-&#13;
economic development implications. The major environmental impacts facing the Park, including&#13;
the proposed mitigation measures are described in a Regional Impact Assessment (RIA) report&#13;
prepared for BAPPENAS in December 1994 and released by GOI to the Bank on April 20, 1995. A&#13;
summary analysis is provided in Annex Il. While the project has addressed these issues by&#13;
including a number of policy, administrative and fiscal responses in the project design (see Working&#13;
Paper 9, Annex 14) the final understanding with GOI on the more prominent issues will be sought at&#13;
negotiations. These issues are as follows:&#13;
5.12   Boundary Rationalization and Forest Concessions. The rationalization of the current Park&#13;
boundary is critical for the successful development and sustainability of the Park as buffer zone&#13;
lands are being subjected to serious disturbance from logging and encroachers. Unless the Park will&#13;
represent a compromise boundary between social and biological pressures, the completion of the&#13;
Park and buffer zonation/land use plan would be futile and the Park would not be sustainable. While&#13;
it is important for project implementation to have the Park boundary gazetted in the shortest possible&#13;
time, it is equally important that the Park boundary, once gazetted, can in future be further&#13;
rationalized in areas contested by villages (forest/non-forest boundaries) and in forest concessions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
bordering the Park with high biodiversity values and with lands categorized as "protected forest"&#13;
areas so that further adjustments to village and forest concession boundaries can take place. During&#13;
negotiations GOI provided the Bank with a 1:250,000 base map of the Park showing (a) the&#13;
delineation of the Park boundary based on the proposed gazetted Park area of approx. 1,368,000 ha,&#13;
and (b) the location of all forest concessions adjoining or near the Park.&#13;
5.13   The following assurances were obtained at negotiations: (a) by March 31, 1997, the&#13;
demarcation of the KSNP boundary would have been completed and that not later than September&#13;
30, 1997 the gazettement of the Park would be completed; (b) by March 31, 1997 GOI would have&#13;
reviewed measures to improve biodiversity management in the logging concessions adjacent to the&#13;
Park, including the possibility of excluding logging activities in certain areas. Thereafter, GOI&#13;
would immediately implement any measure that is found to be feasible; and (c) GOI would take all&#13;
steps to ensure that existing logging permits for forest concessions in areas adjacent to the Park are&#13;
not renewed or extended without the inclusion of a biodiversity management zone for the areas&#13;
adjacent to the Park. Such biodiversity management zones would remain in effect until biodiversity&#13;
surveys would have been carried out for purposes of identifying significant biodiversity sites to be&#13;
protected. Thereafter, the identified biodiversity sites would remain as biodiversity management&#13;
zones.&#13;
5.14   The measures which will be evaluated for keeping logging operations as far from the KSNP&#13;
boundary as possible will include the following: (a) the transfer of intended operations which are&#13;
adjacent to the Park boundary, to blocks further away from the boundary, and (b) an intense&#13;
monitoring program under the project of surveillance and observance of the 500-1000 m buffer zone&#13;
which already applies in GOI regulations to concessions bordering the Park. With respect to the&#13;
renewal and extension of logging operations in concessions bordering the Park, logging operations&#13;
will not proceed inside a 3-km biodiversity management zone along the boundary, where applicable,&#13;
until a biodiversity survey has been carried out.&#13;
5.15   Mining Concessions. There are a number of concession holders (gold and coal) currently&#13;
engaged in mining operations which could potentially have adverse impact to the Park. So far their&#13;
impact on the Park has been small as most concession holders are still at the exploration stage. To&#13;
reduce the potential impact of these mining operations on the Park, assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that:&#13;
(a)   current exploration permits in the Park area (whether under the initial three-year&#13;
period or under one of the two one-year extensions) would not be extended after&#13;
expiration, and that promptly upon the determination by the Ministry of Mining that&#13;
an area subject to a mining concession lacks significant mineral potential, the&#13;
applicable mining concession is terminated in accordance with applicable legislation;&#13;
(b)   prior to the granting of exploration permits and exploitation or production licenses in&#13;
KSNP, furnish to the Bank for comments, the full Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessments (AMDAL) evaluation by GOI's Sectoral AMDAL Commission&#13;
(AMDAL Kegiatan Terpadu /Multisektoral), including the specifications of&#13;
exploration, mining and extraction methods, and any other mitigation measures&#13;
required to minimize any adverse impact on KSNP from the proposed activity;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
(c)   take all measures necessary to ensure that the exploration permit and the exploitation&#13;
or production license, is granted solely on terms consistent with the findings and&#13;
recommendations of GOI's Sectoral AMDAL Commission and the Bank's comments&#13;
on the AMDAL evaluation; and&#13;
(d)   thereafter, ensure that all recommended mitigation measures are promptly and fully&#13;
carried out.&#13;
5.16   Road Development. New roads or even upgrading of existing tracks have potentially&#13;
significant implications for the sustainability of the Park and biodiversity conservation, since they&#13;
provide access to new settlers and opportunities for the expansion of existing agricultural activities&#13;
in the Park. To mitigate against potential impact of road development in the Park, assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that no roads would be constructed or upgraded within KSNP until the&#13;
completion of the Park Management Plan and the land zoning plan for the project area (para. 4.3),&#13;
and that an AMDAL would have been carried out. GOI would also ensure that any construction or&#13;
upgrading would be carried out in a manner consistent with the recommendations of the AMDAL,&#13;
including recommendations for the carrying out of mitigating measures, and the requirements of the&#13;
management plan and land zoning plan.&#13;
5.17   Park Encroachment. Generally the tools available to deal with existing Park encroachment&#13;
are to amend the Park boundary, to demarcate and enforce enclave boundaries and/or to&#13;
resettle/relocate encroachers. However, due to the large size of the Park and insufficient staff&#13;
available to monitor the current impact of individual Park encroachment, there is insufficient&#13;
information available to assess the current Park encroachment and to decide which course of action&#13;
should be taken by the project to mitigate such impact. For this reason, assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that GOI would, until April 1, 1999, not cause or permit involuntary resettlement of&#13;
persons residing within KSNP and thereafter, confine any involuntary resettlement to that required&#13;
for purposes of protection of KSNP's biodiversity. During this initial period of about three years, the&#13;
Project will identify key areas for biodiversity conservation, finalize Park zoning and set criteria for&#13;
resettlement, if any. The project will generally seek to find all possible alternatives to involuntary&#13;
resettlement through the use of zonation and land use improvement. If there is any involuntary&#13;
resettlement to be carried, GOI would fumish to the Bank for approval the Rehabilitation Action Plan&#13;
(OD 4.30) and, thereafter, carry out the resettlement and rehabilitation of affected persons in&#13;
accordance with the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan approved by the Bank. Assurances to&#13;
this effect were obtained at negotiations.&#13;
5.18   Women, Tribal Groups and Poverty Impact. The project potentially would affect the&#13;
livelihoods of tribal group, women, landless and other poor people living in and around KSNP. A&#13;
major emphasis of the village/area development efforts financed under the project will be to target&#13;
poor households and poor communities living in Park boundary villages. Over half the project costs&#13;
are directed to village development affecting 13,400 households the majority of which are poor,&#13;
landless and/or living in remote areas. Given the targeting and the estimated ERR, the project is&#13;
expected to have substantial poverty reduction benefits. In the preparation process stakeholder&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
consultation with these groups have contributed to project design (para. 3.3).   Project&#13;
implementation of both the Park, rural development and the concession component will be carried&#13;
out through a process of participatory decision making, particularly regarding behavior change to&#13;
benefit conservation and increase opportunities for sustainable livelihood. Tribal group involvement&#13;
complies with the requirements of OD 4.20 and the project action plan to deal with these concerns&#13;
are described in paras 3.16-19.&#13;
C. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.19   The long-term sustainability of KSNP will to a large extent depend on a shared responsibility&#13;
in Park conservation between the Ministry of Forestry, local governments of the nine Kabupaten&#13;
making up the Park and the village communities bordering the Park. Participatory planning,&#13;
including land use zonation, development of incentives and alternative livelihood opportunities,&#13;
decentralized decision making and empowerment of local communities, and successful conflict&#13;
resolution of land related issues, will therefore be crucial. It will also depend on the ownership by&#13;
the four provincial governments of the zonation/management plan to be made for the Park and on the&#13;
spatial plan to be prepared for "greater" KSNP, as both plans deal with long-term development&#13;
perspectives of the Park. The prospects for sustainability are enhanced by the fact that the Bank is&#13;
assisting GOI in preparing additional rural development projects in the three provinces of Jambi,&#13;
West Sumatra and Bengkulu, which would provide alternative livelihood to the population and will&#13;
take pressure off the Park. At the central level the project's sustainability will depend on some&#13;
critical policy support and willingness to allow flexible administrative and management&#13;
arrangements. Lastly, public support and awareness for the need of protected area conservation,&#13;
including access to viable post-project financing would be equally important. The latter is particular&#13;
important to the long-term sustainability of the Park. While the project would increase the Park's&#13;
annual budget by two-fold compared with the 1994/5 KSNP budget, it is expected that GOI's fiscal&#13;
implications beyond the project period would level off to slightly above the current fiscal outlay for&#13;
KSNP, which are about US$1.2 million per year. Nevertheless, the project will embark on exploring&#13;
options for future recurrent cost/investment financing of the Park (para 3.14).&#13;
D. RIsKS&#13;
5.20   The major risks associated with the project are the threats to KSNP from sources such as&#13;
road development, human encroachment, and poor logging and concession management practices,&#13;
thus causing further biodiversity impoverishment and potential Park fragmentation. In addition, care&#13;
will have to be exercised to deliver the appropriate incentives and effective community participation&#13;
process and local government commitment to deflect encroachment pressures away from the Park to&#13;
sustainable development alternatives. Unless GOI shows clear commitment to controlling these&#13;
risks, including the resolving of any infringement of rights of foreign and national concession&#13;
holders, the Park's biological diversity will not be maintained over the long-term. The issue of Park&#13;
integrity will be addressed in certain policy agreements and interventions by GOI prior to and during&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
project implementation (paras 5.11/17).  Other risks concern the present lack of integrated&#13;
management plans, coordination between agencies, and enforcement of regulations within the Park&#13;
and the buffer zones. These risks will be addressed by an ICDP project approach which will&#13;
introduce a greater participatory role of local govemment officials and local communities,&#13;
integration of regional and Park planning, and the establishment of an inter-provincial project&#13;
secretariat. This will be linked to a strong project environmental and socio-economic monitoring&#13;
program to provide feedback to project management and allow refinement or corrections in proposed&#13;
project interventions. It is clear that this project has significant risks. Nevertheless, the project&#13;
should proceed because Sumatra's forests and biodiversity have been decimated over the last twenty&#13;
years and the remaining primary forests and biodiversity is largely contained in the protected area&#13;
network, particularly Kerinci Seblat. It should also proceed because of its importance as a pilot&#13;
project to demonstrate Park interventions which can be replicated elsewhere in Indonesia,&#13;
particularly conceming the critical role of people in conservation and in developing a planning&#13;
process that integrates biodiversity conservation with development.&#13;

DETAILS OF PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
A. PARK MANAGEMENT&#13;
Management Planning and Park Zonation&#13;
1.    The first major project activity will be the preparation of a comprehensive management&#13;
plan for the Park This plan will guide and control the management of Park resources, zoe land&#13;
use within the Park, and provide a plan for infrastructure development within the Pak and its&#13;
buffer zone. The planning process will be implemented with close consultation and coordination&#13;
with the regional planning agencies (BAPPEDAs), local governments and target conmmunities.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
2.    The institutional strengthening component will focus on the fbllowing activities:(a)&#13;
strengthening Park personnel through additional recruitment and technical assistance; (b) providing&#13;
in-service training to Park personnel for management and extension activities; and (c) improving&#13;
Park infrastructure for enhanced management and enforcement activities.&#13;
(a)   Strengthening Park Personnel: Currently the Park is understaffed with a totl&#13;
complement of 71 personnel. The GOL as part of its commitment towards&#13;
enhancing Park management, has agreed to assign four senior PHPA staff to  ah&#13;
province, based on performance and staff formation given by the State Minister of&#13;
Administrative Reform, who would assist the Park director by coordinatng Park&#13;
activities within each province. In addition, 100 new project field staff, Pcgawai&#13;
Proyek, would be recruited over the life of the project to supplement edsting field&#13;
staff. The GOI has agreed to regularize these staff as permanent employees based&#13;
on performance and the number of staff allocated by the State Minister of&#13;
Administrative Reform. In addition PHPA will start a "Conuunity Parnership&#13;
Program" through which 190 field-staff will be recruited from local target&#13;
communities as Park community extension workers. The Project will also support&#13;
PHPA through the provision of long-term technical assisnce including an&#13;
ineemationally recruited Park planner, and wildlife enforcement officer.  In&#13;
addition, local staff or intemational volunteers will be assigned to the Park tO assist&#13;
with ecology, management, extension and training.&#13;
(b)   Training: Training will be provided to Park management staff field staff and&#13;
community extension workers. The project will focus on developing staff&#13;
capabilities to protect and manage the Park through both formal and infomual in-&#13;
service training provided by trainers on the TA team. The project will send four&#13;
qualified senior staff on three month short course in Park management, as well as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37 -                            ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
intemational working visits to national Parks in the region. In years 2-3, traveling&#13;
seminars will be held for PHPA technical staff to visit other Indonesian national&#13;
Parks. Field staff will receive broad trauining on enforcement and ecological&#13;
monitorng from the Senior Planner and wildlife specialist, as well as receive field&#13;
manuals for identifying major wildlife. The project will also train and equip four&#13;
special mobile enforcement teams in each province as special task forces for back-&#13;
up enforcement The community extension workers will be provided with in-&#13;
service training in organizing village conservation groups, and wildlife&#13;
identification. Training will be provided by the Park sociologists, extension and&#13;
education officers.&#13;
(c)   Park Infrastructure Support: Infrastructure support consists of cost-sharing the&#13;
upgrading and rehabilitation of existing Park structures (8 field stations and Park&#13;
headquarters) and construction of provincial field quarters (4), new field stations&#13;
(40), information centers (6) and visitor centers (2). In addition the project will&#13;
provide over 100 signposts and entrance posts providing information on the Park.&#13;
Annual maintenance of these structures will be provided through the GOrs&#13;
recurrent budget. The project will assist in providing a full-range of office,&#13;
technical and field equipment, including communications equipment to facilitate&#13;
enforcement and management activities. The GOI has agreed to assign additional&#13;
vehicles and motor cycles to Park authorities to facilitate field enforcement and&#13;
mobile extension activities.&#13;
Boundary Rationalization and Biodiversity Sustainabiity&#13;
3.    Boundary rationalization activities, including biodiversity sustinability, focus on two&#13;
major issues: (a) boundary conflict resolution with target villages within and along the park; and (b)&#13;
improvement of biodiversity sustainability in the forest concessions bordering the Park. Boundary&#13;
ratioalization activities regarding disputed land between villagers and or encroachers and Park&#13;
mangement would continue to be carried out during the first 2 or 3 years of project implementation&#13;
and are directly related to preparation of the Park management plan. The project would also&#13;
review measures to improve biodiversity management within the logging concessions bordering the&#13;
park, particularly in areas adjacent to KSNP. The project would pay for the biodiversity survey&#13;
work in these areas. The project will also work with forest concessionaires and the MoFr Forest&#13;
Utilization directorate to institute a KPHP program which would improve the management of the&#13;
forest concessions.&#13;
4.    Encroachment of Park lands is a major issue for Park enforcement and integrity, and is a&#13;
direct result of inadequate enforcement There are 134 target village areas where boundary conflict&#13;
resolution is required. The process of resolving conficts with local communities over land use&#13;
within the Park will be handled through several options: (a) negotiating temporary land-use rights&#13;
in the Park; (b) implementing boundauy changes; and (c) providing rural development incentives&#13;
based on signing agreements that commit communities to respect demarcated boundaries and&#13;
agreed land-use practices. This strategy would reduce the need for Park enforcement In addition a&#13;
fourth option, of "Pohon Kehidupan" program, will also be implemented which allows settlers&#13;
several options including voluntary resetdement, or gradual conversion of existing farming systems&#13;
to permanent multipurpose fruit tree production.&#13;
&#13;

Management Activities&#13;
5.    Three categones of management activities will be implemented by PBPA field staff during&#13;
the course of the project: (a) wildlife protection and management; (b) establishnt of a living&#13;
boundary marking and posting; and (c) habitat rehabilitation. The project will focus on protection&#13;
of large mammal fauna by developing effective enforcement systems to combat poachmg&#13;
Activities include field surveys; establishing elephant patrols; and barriers agamst animal raiding.&#13;
Live boundary marking will be implemented over the life of the project by demarcatng 500 km of&#13;
boundary using Arenga palm seedlings. Local villagers will be contract  to plant and care for&#13;
these seedlings. These in combination with cement boundary markers will assist the public in&#13;
determining the exact boundary of the Park. Habitat rehabilitation activities will focus on yealy&#13;
assessment and status update of encroached land within the Park (4000 ha per year will be&#13;
surveyed); rehabilitation of degraded areas with multi-purpose indigenous trees; and the&#13;
development of 10 village nurseries to raise 65,000 seedlings for replanting programs.&#13;
Research&#13;
6.    The project will support management-oriented research, including species distribution and&#13;
population dynamics. Rapid biodiversity appraisals to determine appropriate use and Park ming&#13;
will be done in the first two years of project implementation through specialist institutes such as&#13;
the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), the Center for Intemational Forestry Research (CIFOR)&#13;
and local Sumatran universities. Ecological monitoring activities will be identified by the Park&#13;
management team including consultant biologists, and will be implemented by the monitoring team&#13;
whose activities are described under the monitoring component In addition a small project-&#13;
supported research fund will provide seed money for research projects consistent with Park&#13;
management objectives submitted by local NGOs and university researchers. Proposals for&#13;
biodiversity grants would be reviewed by the Park authorities assisted by a peer review panel of&#13;
e,demal experts.&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
7.    Monitoring activities will be implemented by the monitoring team whose activities are&#13;
described under the monitoring component.&#13;
Extension and Awareness&#13;
S.    The project will develop a broad public awareness program to promote local appreciation&#13;
of the Park through conservation promotion interventions. The program will be initiated in year 2&#13;
and cotinue through the duration of the project. Priority target groups include (a) local&#13;

Management and Implementation&#13;
9.    The project will be based at Park headquarters in Sungai Penuh (Jambi province), and will&#13;
establish and equip a field office in Curup (Bengkulu province) near priority areas targeted for&#13;
integrated development and Park management activities. The Project manager assisted by a&#13;
PMPRO wili be responsible for the overall management of project staff and technical assistance&#13;
team. He will be assisted by the four senior-province based staff in implementing project activities&#13;
and will also receive support from technical assistance staff.&#13;
10. Implementation of field activities will be through the existing line structure with extension&#13;
workers and community field workers implementing community awareness, extension and&#13;
enforcement activities and reporting through the provincial field-staff structure to the Park Manager&#13;
(Figure 1). Pre-project implementation activities will focus on rehabilitation of Park headquarters,&#13;
re-deployment and recruitment of staff, assessment of potential Park boundary problem areas.&#13;
During the first year of project implementation, Park management activities will focus on: initiating&#13;
community parnership programs; coordinating with local govemment; preliminary species&#13;
surveys; boundary and encroachment surveys; social forestry and boundary demarcation activities;&#13;
and extension and community awareness programs.&#13;
Component Linkages&#13;
11.   The Park management component will be closely coordinated with the area/village&#13;
development component and the forest concession management component through the following:&#13;
(a) targeted site selection of villages for rural development activities - in the first year of&#13;
implementation activities will be in four sites (Tapan, Jangkat, Katenong, Ketahun) where human&#13;
interactions are having a major adverse impact on biodiversity; (b) through coordinated community&#13;
awareness programs linked to enforcement activities; (c) through boundary demarcation and&#13;
completion of Park gazettement; and (d) through biodiversity surveys and protection of biodiversity&#13;
habitats within the concessions. Coordination of component activities will take place through the&#13;
inter-provincial coordination committee (IPCC) described under the project organization section.&#13;
B. AREANILLAGE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Objective&#13;
12. The rural development component's main objective is to reduce encroachment and&#13;
conserve biodiversity, by providing incentives for alternative livelihoods to local communities who&#13;
currently use Park resources. This component aims to provide assistance to 134 target boundary&#13;
villages to improve resource management on village lands, ensure security of access to traditionally&#13;
used resources, increase agricultural productivity and improve village infrastructure. Project&#13;
activities will target groups, most dependent on Park resources, and provide them with altemative&#13;
income-generating opportunities. Activities will be implemented by local government agencies&#13;
with technical support from project-financed advisors and local NGOs. The component will be&#13;
largely implemented by the communities in the park interaction zone in accordance with a&#13;
participatory development process involving four steps, namely: situational assessment, planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-                             ANNEXI&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
and work programming, implementing and monitoring, review and evaluation and re-plannig&#13;
This iterative process will be initiated and sustained in each target community by resident project&#13;
facilitators working in close collaboration with formal and infoimal leaders and though traditional&#13;
or newly-organized common-interst groups. In close conjunction with members of visiting&#13;
technical assistance team and various staff from the Kecamatan and Kabupaten, each commuity&#13;
will be assisted to first generate by concensus their own village land use and village development&#13;
plan.&#13;
Village Resource Management&#13;
13. The village planning process would rationalize land use, secure access to resources,&#13;
establish development priorities and conserve biodiversity in selected Park boundary villages. Ihe&#13;
project will assist communities map village boundaries and current land use/ownership practices,&#13;
evaluate and capability, and through a consultative decision-making process, institute land use&#13;
zonation for agriculture, non wood forest products and conservation areas. The land use plan will&#13;
be formalized as a Community Conservation Agreement, that legalizes village access to&#13;
resources in the Park and its buffer zone, and guarantees specified development assistance, in&#13;
return for community cooperation in Park protection and conserving biodiversity resources on&#13;
vilage lands. The project will assist the local Kabupaten legislature to prepare and pass legisla&#13;
recognizing the legality of such agreements.&#13;
Vlllage Development&#13;
14. Village development activities raise the economic status of the whole village by providing&#13;
infrastructure support (water, small roads, culverts) to raise income and create goodwill for the&#13;
Park~ and assistance for diversifying agriculture thus providing poor villagers with higher income&#13;
from village lands. Each target village will receive a maximum of US$50,000 for a combination of&#13;
infrastructue and agricultural assistance. Activity selection will be based on development priorities&#13;
set in the village development plan, produced through a participatory decision-maldng process&#13;
coordinated by the village head and the village development council (LKMD). Activities will be&#13;
selected from a menu of development activities that meet project criteria. Villagers would provide&#13;
labor, and if necessary use credit to purchase fertilizer and other inputs. The implementing agency&#13;
will provide expertise, extension, equipment and construction materials financed by the project&#13;
Development activities will be phased with ten villages selected in the first year, I8 in year 2, 19 in&#13;
year 3, 28 in year 4, 29 in year 5 , and 30 in year 6 or a total of 134 target villages. This gradual&#13;
phasing will allow local organizations time to develop sufficient institutional capacity to implement&#13;
participatory, community based activities at the village-level. In addition the project will support a&#13;
series of feasibility studies to determine the economic feasibility of a number of altenative income-&#13;
generating enterprises such as ecotounsmn. These will be identified by the Project Stering&#13;
Committee during implementation. The studies will be commissioned through local business and&#13;
marketing consultants.&#13;
Planning Support&#13;
15.   Village-level plans will be based on the village-resource management exercise, and will&#13;
involve local NGO staff working with local commuities, using PRA and micro-planning&#13;
techniques, over a 6-8 month period to prepare an annual work program as well as an overall five-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-                             ANNEXI&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
year village plan. This plan will identify priority activities requirng external support, finaning,&#13;
time-frame and include community contributions. Similarly at the district-level, for the five priority&#13;
Kabupatens, spatial plans will be revised to account for natural resource distribution, the impact of&#13;
their utilization and other forms of development (such as roads) on biodiversity conservation. This&#13;
multi-sectoral planning will be conducted by BAPPEDA II (the planning agency at the Kabupaten-&#13;
level) with technical assistance provided by the project&#13;
Training&#13;
16. Training is a major activity in terms of building insfitutional capacity to implement ICDP&#13;
activities. A training needs assessment will be conducted in the first or second year of project&#13;
implementation to devise a Rural Development Training Plan tailored to the needs of project&#13;
coordinators, Bappeda Planners, kecamatan staff and extension agents. In addition, annual Zopp&#13;
participatory planning meetings will be held with principal project stakeholders to ensure that&#13;
feedback from community groups and implementation agencies is incorporated in annual project&#13;
work-plans. Training will be provided by members of the Technical assistance team and planning&#13;
advisors. PRA training for community organizers (para 19) selected from boundary villages, and&#13;
local NGOs will be provided by WWF.&#13;
Management and Implementation&#13;
17. The lead agency managing this component will be the BAPPEDA 11, who will act as the&#13;
Kabupaten-level coordinator (PIMPRO). The Kabupaten-coordinator is the primary manager for&#13;
inplementing and monitoring component activities. The PIMRO coordinates the activities of the&#13;
relevant technical agencies (Dinases) providing technical and extension services to target villages&#13;
and the technical advisory team including local NGOs. Each district involved in the project will be&#13;
faciltated by a management support group composed of the PIMPRO, the WWF district&#13;
coordinator and visiting WWF specialist staff, visiting members of the technical support team (this&#13;
includes: a rural development advisor, agricultural advisors, small enterprise advisors, planners),&#13;
and representatives of participating extension agencies selected as the situation requires. The&#13;
PIMPRO reports to the Bupati (District Head) and the BAPPEDA I at the provincial-level. The&#13;
Technical Assistance to be provided by WWF would focus on the process of participatory village&#13;
land use and village development planning, including facilitating a Commmunity Conservatin&#13;
Agreement and training of village facilitators, whereas the technical support team would provide a&#13;
more specific technical facilitating role, including regional planning and would be closely&#13;
associated with the staff of the technical agencies. Coordination of activities between Kabupatens&#13;
and Provinces takes place through the Inter-Provincial Coordination Committee. This committee&#13;
is composed of representatives of the four govemors, the Park Director, a representative of the&#13;
MoFr Forest Utilization directorate, and WWF.&#13;
18. Implementation of component activities is built around three major processes: village&#13;
selection; formulating an activity menu; and village implementation. Village selection will begin&#13;
ardy in implementation to prioritize villages and identify special management areas. Each&#13;
Kabupaten will develop an activity menu of project approved activities that will be formulated&#13;
through a process of expert evaluation, feasibility study and information exchange with other&#13;
kabupatens. Implementation follows a phased sequence of activities: survey, situation analysis,&#13;
facilitation, planning, implementation and monitoring. Village development activity proposals are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42 -                            ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
prepared by target groups (facilitated by local community organizers and NGOs), reviewed by the&#13;
village counci (LKMD) and forwarded by the village head as a development proposal (DUP)&#13;
through a consultative process (UDKP) at the sub-district (kecanatan-level). These are then&#13;
forwarded to the Kabupaten where the proposals will be reviewed by the Kabupaten PIMPRO and&#13;
forwarded to a provincial guidance team for approval. Funds will be channeled through the&#13;
Kabupaten PIMPRO who will release them to the lead technical agency responsible for assisting&#13;
villagers implement a project activity.&#13;
19.   Resident village facilitators (tenaga/pendamping) will play a key role in the village&#13;
development component They will initiate and supervise all community-based implementation of&#13;
project activities in each target village, including the identification and strengthening of existing&#13;
common-interest groups and the organization of target groups, orienting and assisting them with&#13;
participatory rural appraisal, village land use- and development planning, annual work&#13;
programming and budgetting, and with implementing their planned development interventions.&#13;
Owing to the critcal importance of this facilitation function, the work involved, and the isolation&#13;
and size of most target villages, there will be two facilitators assigned to each village. The village&#13;
conservation facilitator (VCF) will be a graduate or high school diploma-holder experienced in&#13;
community work recruited from the district. The local community organizer (LCO) will be&#13;
recruited from the village and nominated by the LKMD. The LCO will act as the local assistant&#13;
trainee to the VCF and towards the end of the establishment phase (i.e. during the third year of&#13;
implementation) will assume increasing responsibility for facilitating project processes in the&#13;
village. After the third year the VCF will move on to initiate and facilitate the project in the other&#13;
villages targeted during the expansion phase (Years 4-6).&#13;
Component Linkages&#13;
20.   The areavillage development component has close links to Park management, improved&#13;
concession management and planning activities. In Park management, target village selection and&#13;
boundary rationalization activities have to be coordinated with Park management activities. Park&#13;
staff will also participate in negoiating community conservation agreements with boundary villages&#13;
as a prerequisite for development investment The two components will also develop monitoring&#13;
indicators for human impact on the Park. In concession areas, the rural development component&#13;
will target twenty four villages for development assistance. Planning advisors will also assist the&#13;
Kabupaten technical advisory team to ensure the project activities conform to regional and spatial&#13;
plans.&#13;
&#13;

C. INTEGRATING BIoDIVERSrrY IN FOREsr CONCESSION MANAGEMFENT&#13;
Concession Biodiversity Assessment&#13;
21.   This component will support four main activities. These include: training for enhanced&#13;
biodiversity conservation within forest concessions; independent audits of logging operations;&#13;
biodiversity assessment conservation within production areas; and community forestiy activities.&#13;
Training for Improved Forest Management within Conservation Areas&#13;
22.   The project will provide short-term technical expertise to assist the Ministry of Forestry,&#13;
provincial forest agency (Dinas Kehutanan) and concessionaires with the irnplementation of&#13;
improved biodiversity conservation within concession areas. Focus will be on forest sites during&#13;
and after logging. The project will provide training support to selected trainees from the Ministry,&#13;
Dinas, concessions. Training will focus on techniques and knowledge needed to conserve in-situ&#13;
biodiversity in concession areas. The project will provide support for 220 traineeships of 2-3 week&#13;
duration. The project will also fund production of training materials, visiting experts and field&#13;
travel as required. Training activities will be linked to biodiversity assessment information&#13;
generated from concessions.&#13;
Independent Audits of Logging Operations&#13;
23.   To ensure that upgraded monitoring and enforcement is having the desired effect the&#13;
project will contract the services of a forest inspection firm to audit operations in the eleven&#13;
concessions bordering the Park. Standards for forest management, environmental and social&#13;
performance based on those currently being developed by the Indonesian Ecolabelling Institute&#13;
(LEI) in collaboration with the international Forest Stewardship Council will be employed. The&#13;
LET will be invited to participate in field inspection activities. Inspection activities will be phased&#13;
with, two concessions (picked at random) selected per year for audits. Audit results will be&#13;
submitted to the IPCC and the Directorate of Forest Utilization for appropriate follow-up and&#13;
action.&#13;
Biodiversity Conservation within Concession Areas.&#13;
24.   The project will support field ecological surveys to identify and locate especially biodiverse&#13;
areas within the concessions. The surveys will make use of eisting field, GIS and remote sensing&#13;
data available from INTAG (Directorate for Forest Inventory), and other GOI agencies. The&#13;
project will also support initial activities to demarcate and manage these areas. Ihis component&#13;
will require close coordination with the Park Management team and the Park Director. Project&#13;
funds will pay for short-term field biodiversity specialists and field survey costs.&#13;
Community Forestry&#13;
25.   The project will identify areas (based on remote sensing and ground survey) where&#13;
significant encroachment has occurred into logged-over and unlogged production forest areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-                            ANNEX &#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
Communities living in or near such areas will be identified through field socio-economic surveys,&#13;
and engaged in community forestry and rural development activities as described under the rural&#13;
development component. Such communities will be selected for allocation of community forestry&#13;
agreements, and the project will provide income generating investments, and inputs to improve&#13;
land use on these sites. The continuity of financial support will be made contingent upon&#13;
performance in curtailing encroachment. Some twenty four villages will be selected out of the 134&#13;
target villages near forest concession areas.  Activities under this sub-component will be&#13;
implemented jointly with the rural development component&#13;
Management and Implementation&#13;
26.   A staff of the Kanwil Kehutanan Jambi, section responsible for concession monitoring, will&#13;
be assigned as the project manager (PIMPRO) for the project The PIMPRO is responsible for the&#13;
day-to-day implementation of activities financed under this component, and will report through the&#13;
Kanwil Kehutanan to a Project Management Committee in the Ministry of Forestry. The PIMPRO&#13;
will be supported by a project-funded Management Support Unit and Technical Advisory Group&#13;
which will assists with annual planning, financial management, monitoring and reporting. The&#13;
technical advisory team will include a: senior ecologist, training and biodiversity consultants and a&#13;
community forestry advisor attached to the rural development team. Field programs will be&#13;
implemented through the Dinas Kehutanan II (Pimbagpro) in the Kabupatens covering the target&#13;
concession areas (Sarolangun Bangko and Bungo Tebo in Jambi and Bengkulu Utara in&#13;
Bengkulu).&#13;
27.   An ICDP Project Management Committee (PMC) will be established to supervise the Park&#13;
Management and Concession Management components within the Ministry of Forestry. The PMC&#13;
will provide policy and technical guidance. The PMC will be chaired by the Director Bureau of&#13;
Foreign Cooperation (KLN) with members from the DG Forest Inventory and Land Use (INTAG),&#13;
DG PHPA (Director of National Parks, and Director Bina Programs), DG Forest Utilization&#13;
(Director of KPHP and Director Bina Programs), the Secretary General's Office, Forest Research&#13;
and a representative of the forest concessionaire's association (APHI).&#13;
Component Linkages&#13;
28.   Activities financed under the Concession Management Component will be closely&#13;
coordinated with the Park Management component, specifically: boundary delineation and&#13;
ecological surveys within the concession areas; and with the Rural Development component;&#13;
specifically selection of target villages for community forestry activities and the financing and&#13;
implementation of village infrastructure and income generating activities.&#13;
D. PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
29.   The monitoring program aims to develop the institutional capacity of the various agencies&#13;
involved in the conservation and protection of the Park to monitor biodiversity and socio-economic&#13;
conditions and to plan "Park friendly" economic programs. The program will support the Park&#13;
Management and Biodiversity Conservation component by providing tools for monitoring&#13;
encroachment, poaching, and other uncontrolled development activities within the Park and by&#13;
developing performance indicators assessing the health and well-being of the Park. It will support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45-                           ANNEX 1&#13;

the Concession Management component by monitoring the integrity of the boundaries betwee the&#13;
concessions and the Park and by monitoring forest conditions and management practices wihin the&#13;
concessions. It will support the Rural Development component by developing capacities for&#13;
analzn the impacts of rural development activities both on the Park and on the local communities&#13;
in the buffer zone around the Park and by assessing the project's effectiveness in enhancing the&#13;
socio-economic conditions of local people.&#13;
30. The project will provide technical assistance support in the first year of the project to&#13;
design and establish the overall monitoring system, including the Geographic Infonnation Systenm&#13;
In addition, assistance will be provided to finalize the selection of appropriate indicators, develop a&#13;
Data Base Management syem, input baseline data, introduce and integrate the system into the&#13;
eistng institutional environment, and implement a human resource development program to&#13;
enable the staff of the various government agencies at various levels to operate the system In the&#13;
second and third years of the project, the practical application of the system will be tested. The&#13;
system will be filly operational at this stage to support evaluation and impact assessment acivities.&#13;
Following a thorough review, additional data and indicators will be added to the database. The&#13;
monitoring and evaluation systems will include Geographic Information System capabilities that&#13;
will be integrated into the overall Management Infornation System&#13;
31.   The technical assistance will include appoximatelY 99 staff-months of support (16 nwnths&#13;
expatriate and 83 months local). The TA will include a long-term local GIS/monitoring specialist&#13;
who will serve as team leader and assist the Park manager in supervising the M&amp;E activities. It&#13;
will also include an expatriate monitoring advisor, an MIS specialist, and an evaluation specialist&#13;
The project will provide support for computer hardware and software for the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation activities at the Park office and at the provincial and kabupaten planning offices.&#13;
Support will also be provided for data collection and conversion. This will include satellite&#13;
imagery, aerial photography, map baseline data, ground verification data, and socio-economic&#13;
surveys. Training (approxmael 153 staff-months) will be provided to provincial, kabupaten, and&#13;
Park managers to ensure the systematic use of the monitoring infornation in the planning and&#13;
decision-making processes.&#13;
32. The monitoring and evaluation activity will fall under the direction and responsibility of the&#13;
Park management office in Sungai Penuh. This office will establish a "base" for the information&#13;
system and will collaborate and cooperate with the existng infornation coltection and analysis&#13;
activities of a local NGO (World Wildlife Fund). Each of the agencies with a responsibility for&#13;
implementing components of the project (e.g., the BAPPEDAs and the Kanwils Kehutanan) will&#13;
also be strened with a "subset" of the ovrall mnitoring systenL The Park manager will be&#13;
overalt responsible for the developmenctand implementation of the M&amp;E sysem&#13;

SUMMARY SOCIAL ASSESSMENT INFORMATION FOR&#13;
BOUNDARY VILLAGES&#13;
Demographic Factorn&#13;
1.    The population in the nine buffer zone districts (kabupatens) suroundig the Park is&#13;
approximately 3.3 million. The 36 sub-districts (Kecamatas) bordering the Park have a&#13;
population of 1.64 million. The population of the 468 boundary villages ranges from 500-700,000&#13;
people. The largest population concentrations in the immediate vicinity of the Park, are at Sungi&#13;
Penuh (62,000) in the center, Lubuk Linggau (103,000) and Curup (131,000) in the South.&#13;
Population density in the rural kecamatans varies between 8-80 persons per km2. The village&#13;
populations range from several hundred to more than a thousand inhabitants (50-300 households).&#13;
The population in the four provinces grew by 2.8 percent p.a. in the period 1970-90, well above&#13;
the national average of 2.0 percent. In-migration is the major cause of this high level of&#13;
population growth, in particular in Bengkulu province where annual growth was close to 4.4&#13;
percent. The province of West Sumatra is an exception, where growth rates are decreasing from&#13;
2.2 to 1.6 percent due to a long tradition of male out-migration.&#13;

The project strategy is to develop a series of programs ranging from incentives to pull people&#13;
away from the boundary villages, to alternative income generating programs for households in&#13;
these villages.&#13;
Cultural Groups and Local Institutions&#13;
2.    There is considerable ethnic variation between the four provinces, and with this variation&#13;
in traditional village organizations, systems of community organization, and village-level decision-&#13;
making over resource management. The following table gives a breakdown of the predominant&#13;
ethnic groups and their use of local institutions for resource management. There are two sets of&#13;
institutions that operate in these boundary villages: traditional organizations such as the Nimk&#13;
Mamak Kaum and Marga, and government established institutions such as the Lembaga&#13;
Ketahanan Mas&gt;wakat Desa (LKMD) and the Lembaga Maswrakat Desa (LMD) the village&#13;
development council and consultation forum which takes decisions on development activities at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the village level and is the officially recognized forum for village-based consultation. In many of&#13;
the boundary villages, due to in-migration of Javanese and other ethnic groups, traditional&#13;
institutions no longer play a significant role in regulating resource use. This allows outsiders to&#13;
enter protected forest areas for agriculture, tree crops and other opportunistic use. Traditional&#13;
organizations continue to exert a major influence in land use and resource access decision-making&#13;
in boundary villages in West Sumatra, Kabupaten Kerinci and in some villages in Bengkulu. The&#13;
project design calls for an in-depth inventory of these institutions and will support their&#13;
involvement in project implementation as well as formal village institutions.&#13;

Categories of Encroachers&#13;
3.    There are five categories of encroachers operating in KSNP boundary villages:&#13;
(a)   Wealthy "Patrons" ( Pertani berdasi) who finance farm workers to clear forest and&#13;
plant cinnamon. The worker receive a monthly wage, food and 50 percent of the&#13;
crop value after harvest, usually a period of up to 10 years. Some patrons purchase&#13;
young (1-2 year old) cinnamon plantations.&#13;
(b)   Local People (elit desa) who live outside the Park but enter to develop plantations&#13;
ranging in size from 4-500 ha in multiple plots and sites. The trees are&#13;
progressively felled as they mature and after one or two coppice crops, the soil is&#13;
abandoned and the farmer claims ownership of the abandoned plot.&#13;
(c)   People who live outside the Park (pemukin dikawasan) do not own a house or&#13;
farm outside and have lived in settlements for many years. Some of these&#13;
settlements are officially registered as enclaves within the Park and have village&#13;
status.&#13;
(d)   Newcomers (pendatang) from outside the Park, mainly young couples.&#13;

Adat Institutions and Resource Control&#13;
4.    In boundary villages where Adat Institutions are still fimctioning, they play a significant&#13;
role in regulating resource use, protecting watershed areas and in West Sumatra, reWling the&#13;
complex system of communal land tenure. The following description of how the adat institution&#13;
fiunctions in Lempur, a typical boundary village, in kabupaten Kernci, provides input in how such&#13;
institutions could play a key role in biodiversity conservation.&#13;
5.    In Lempur Vldlage the smallest social unit is described as a tumbi (household), several&#13;
lumbi - based on kinship - form a perut. A group of perut are described as a kalbu and seveal&#13;
kalbu form a kaum or clan. A village may contain several kaums which are called kwug&#13;
kampung. The adat leader of the whole village is called the Depati Agung. His decisions are&#13;
based on consultation, and he is assisted in his tasks by two other Depads. Decisions are only&#13;
made when all three are present at a meeting. Each Depah has specific roles: one deals with the&#13;
government, the second is responsible for naes and laws and the third is responsible for&#13;
development activities. Depatis are chosen based on their economic standing in the community.&#13;
Villers follow adat restrictions, mainly for fear of social ostracization from the community.&#13;
Many Adat leaders also play a dual role as govenmment representatives in 'official' village&#13;
institutions such as council members of the LMD or as the village head. Most village-level&#13;
disputes and conflicts are resolved through village meetings chaired by the Depati. In Lempur&#13;
village this traditional institution has played a major role in resolving boundary conflicts with the&#13;
Park and developing a consaesus village-land use plan and zonation which will be enforced by the&#13;
Kaum.&#13;
6.    In "ethnically" homogenous villages, such traditional institutions can play a major role as&#13;
intermediaries between Park authorities and villagers in resolving boundary and land use conflicts.&#13;
In more heterogeneous villages, with new migrants, the more formal government administered&#13;
institutions and religious institutions assisted by NGOs will play this role. During the first year of&#13;
project implementation, the local NGOs will assist the implementing institutions identify&#13;
traditional groups and institutions in the boundary villages to work with in implementing&#13;
development activities and enforcing conservation agreements.&#13;

lAnd Tenure&#13;
7.    Very little land near the Park boundary, outside of transmigration sites is titled. In West&#13;
Sumatran boundary villages land is controlied through a system of communal and individual land&#13;
temnre, with most wet rice plots being individually titled, whereas tree crop (ladang) lands are&#13;
controlled by clan ownership. In the other provinces, with the decline in the influence of&#13;
traditional organizations, coupled with ambiguity of land tenure, there is limited internal village&#13;
control on outside migrants coming-in and opening new upland fields within the Park boundary.&#13;
Further work on land tenure systems in the boundary villages will be done during implementation.&#13;
The project will develop Community Conservation Agreements which will give usufruct rights&#13;
to local communities for buffer zone areas and allow them to prevent outsiders from opening new&#13;
lands within the Park.&#13;

COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND STAKEHOLDER&#13;
CONSULTATION ACTIVITIES&#13;
1.      Community and "stakeholder" consultation activities have been an integral part of project&#13;
preparation, design and will continue to play an important role during project implementation. The&#13;
project "stakeholders" include the following groups: provincial and local governments; PHPA (Park&#13;
Management Authority); sectoral technical agencies; forest concession holders; industrial crop&#13;
estates; local and national NGOs; local communities and traditional organizations.&#13;
2.      The objective of the consultation activities were the following:&#13;
*       Inform project stakeholders of the proposed project and its objective;&#13;
*       Allow   opportunities  for  information  to  be  presented  by  stakeholders  and&#13;
communities on issues and problems related to KSNP and its buffer zone;&#13;
*       Allow for stakeholder input in ICDP project design from primary stakeholders.&#13;
These consultation activities have used a range of participatory techniques to meet these objectives.&#13;

Community Consultation Activities with Local NGOs&#13;
3.    Community consultation activities have provided invaluable project design input, by&#13;
allowing participants from representative boundary villages the opportunity to identify problems and&#13;
issues related to the Park and possible development initiatives that could be implemented by local&#13;
institutions. Village-level community consultation has been conducted by WWF and WARSI, a local&#13;
network of conservation and development NGOs. These activities have provide valuable base-line&#13;
information for the project, as well as have supported local-level institutional development. These&#13;
consultation activities have been implemented in ten boundary villages in the four provinces.&#13;
Villages were selected on the basis of high-level of interaction between the community and the Park.&#13;
Financial support for these activities, including further start-up training and planning (to be&#13;
completed before April 1996) was provided by JGF.&#13;
Base-line Socio-economic and Landscape Surveys&#13;
4.    WWF has conducted a baseline socio-economic and landscape survey in the following six&#13;
villages: Rantau Kermas, Muara Imat, Renah Kayu Embun (Jambi Province) and Sukamerindu,&#13;
Sungei Ipuh, Talang Arah (Bengkulu province). The specific objectives of this activities were as&#13;
follows:&#13;
*  To compile an integrated database of physical and socioeconomic information to be used&#13;
for participatory planning and project monitoring activities;&#13;
* To prepare participatory plans in the interaction zone of the survey areas; and&#13;
* To test and develop implementation strategies to assist the ICDP.&#13;
These activities are being conducted in close collaboration with the local community, local&#13;
government representatives and Park management authorities.&#13;
NGO Community Consultation Activities&#13;
5.    WARSI is a network of twelve local Sumatra-based NGOs, many of whom are actively&#13;
assisting local communities with development activities in villages adjacent to the Park. The NGOs&#13;
are working in boundary villages in the four provinces covering KSNP-(Sungei Manau Atas in W.&#13;
Sumatra; Napal Licin in S.Sumatra; Katenong in Bengkulu and Pelompek in Jambi). WARSI is&#13;
assisting the ICDP preparation by undertaking the following activities:&#13;
* strengthening the local NGOs so they can actively participate in implementing the ICDP;&#13;
* conducting surveys on local institutions and community organizations working in the&#13;
villages and assessing their potential to participate in the ICDP;&#13;
* producing a series of case studies on people-Park interactions and identifying&#13;
mechanisms for conflict resolution;&#13;
&#13;

* developing media materials (posters, videos, pamphlets, newsletter) to provide&#13;
information to local communities on the ICDP.&#13;
Description of Participatory Techniques&#13;
6.    WWF and WARSI are using several innovative participatory "tools" to involve boundary&#13;
communities in ICDP project design. Both groups are using Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA)&#13;
techniques to involve community members in problem identification, analysis and development of&#13;
potential ICDP interventions. Some of the tools used are described as follows:&#13;
* Sketch-maps of the boundary villages drawn by community members, showing village&#13;
land use, settlements, and Park boundary;&#13;
* Land use Transects identifying land use linked to topography, soils, agricultural and tree&#13;
crops, interaction with the Park and problems constraining production;&#13;
* Time Lines indicating history of village settlement, and introduction of external&#13;
development interventions including boundary demarcation;&#13;
S Seasonal Calendars indicating variation in seasonal agricultural activities;&#13;
* Ranking and Trends: priority ranking exercises to identify possible interventions; and&#13;
analysis of village development trends in health, transportation, education, commodity&#13;
production and interaction with Park boundary; and&#13;
*  Institutional Diagrams identifying different institutions working at the village level, their&#13;
role in decision-making and level of interaction between institutions.&#13;
In addition, the local NGOs are working closely with traditional leaders and community groups&#13;
through regular village-based community meetings to discuss land use near the Park boundary, ways&#13;
to develop consensus zonation near the boundary, Park protection and implementation of ICDP&#13;
activities.&#13;
Zopp1 Planning Workshops&#13;
7.    Objective&#13;
The primary objective of the participatory planning workshops (ZOPP) are the following:&#13;
* to train representatives of different stakeholder groups involved in implementing the&#13;
ICDP in participatory planning methodology;&#13;
* to develop a planning document (project planning matrix, plan of operations) utilizing&#13;
the methodology;&#13;
* improve communication and common understanding of the issues among the Dinas&#13;
agencies to be involved in executing the project; and&#13;
* improve community participation by discussing and analyzing problems jointly with&#13;
community representatives.&#13;

The Process&#13;
8.    The Zopp methodology uses participants knowledge and experience, and allows them to&#13;
express their opinions freely through a system of presenting written information on cards. These&#13;
cards are then analyzed by the group. The workshop, conducted over a period of four days, and&#13;
facilitated by an experienced ZOPP facilitator follows a process-oriented approach which builds on&#13;
group analysis, discussion and consensus. The following steps describe the ZOPP process:&#13;
*     Step 1: problem analysis and identification of core problem;&#13;
*     Step 2: identification of causes leading to the problem, developing a problems tree&#13;
which allows complex relationships to be portrayed;&#13;
*     Step 3: the problem tree is transformed into an objective tree by translating a&#13;
negative existing situation into a desired situation in the future by providing several&#13;
alternative solutions;&#13;
*     Step 4: solutions are screened using project planning criteria;&#13;
Step 5: involves developing a project planning matrix which shows how the project&#13;
should be carried out, what is the project goal; how it is proposed to achieve this&#13;
goal; what external factors influence this; how to measure the extent by which the&#13;
objectives have been attained; data required for evaluation and cost estimates for&#13;
project activities.&#13;
ZOPP workshops were conducted for ICDP stakeholders in all four provinces. These ZOPP&#13;
workshops helped bring together the principal "stakeholders" - community members, NGOs, local&#13;
government agencies, and PHPA- who will be responsible for implementing the project in the future.&#13;
The project planning matrix described in Box I indicates the preliminary results from the ZOPP held&#13;
in Jambi.&#13;
Output&#13;
9.    The output of the workshop is a project planning matrix that helps decision makers overview&#13;
the project strategy, indicators for achieving its goal, and the purpose and result of the project. This&#13;
analyses allows the government technical executing agencies develop a plan of operation which&#13;
spells out who has to do what, when, where, and how much the activity will cost. The important&#13;
output of the process is a greater understanding among the different agencies involved, which results&#13;
in improved coordination and cooperation which is essential for the ICDP project.&#13;

will continue to use the following participatory techniques during project implementation:&#13;
*     NGO-assisted training of boundary communities in PRA techniques to conduct&#13;
village-based analysis and design of ICDP development interventions financed by the&#13;
project;&#13;
*     preparation of village-level maps, delineating land use and zonation based on&#13;
consultation and participatory field-based sketch mapping. These maps will provide&#13;

INDICATIVE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES&#13;
A number of candidate development activities were proposed by government officials,&#13;
and by the project preparation team. These activities fall into the categories of agriculture,&#13;
forestry, small enterprise/industry, social welfare, tourism, and public village infrastructure.&#13;
These indicative development activities are listed and briefly described below:&#13;
AGRICULTURE&#13;
1.    Cassiavera Intensification: To increase returns and sustainability of this profitable tree&#13;
crop through selective breeding, better agronomic practices, and inter-cropping with other tree or&#13;
food crops.&#13;
2.    Tea: To establish smallholder tea estates on unused land for poor or landless families.&#13;
This concept has already been proven successful in Kabupaten Solok, West Sumatra.&#13;
3.    Vegetable Integrated Pest Management:  To decrease the use of environmentally&#13;
destructive pesticides in temperate vegetable growing areas around the Park through introduction&#13;
of IPM techniques.&#13;
4.    Vanilla: To introduce this high value crop to agro-ecologically suitable areas. Vanilla is&#13;
already being grown successfully on a small scale in Kabupaten Kerinci.&#13;
5.    Improved Jungle Rubber: To increase the productivity and biodiversity value of this low&#13;
intensity agricultural system found extensively in the lowlands to the east of the Park. Initial&#13;
exploratory research on this system has been conducted by French scientists.&#13;
6.    Cage fish culture: To introduce these highly productive systems to villages that have an&#13;
adequate source of flowing water, and a market for the fish. Cage culture is already established&#13;
at the outlet of Lake Kerinci.&#13;
7.    Fish Ponds: To introduce these relatively low input protein production systems to&#13;
villages that do not have access to fish from rivers or lakes. Fish production has the potential to&#13;
reduce hunting pressure on wild animal populations inside and outside the Park.&#13;
8.    Small Ruminants: To introduce goats to poor families as a source of protein and income.&#13;
9.    Bee Keeping: To introduce the skill and inputs of bee keeping to target groups that have&#13;
small plots of land. Honey is a high value, easily transported produce that requires little land for&#13;
its production.&#13;
&#13;

10.   Agroforestry: To introduce agroforestry systems based on cassiavera or other tree crops&#13;
to the project area. ICRAF has already begun preliminary agroforestry research near the Park in&#13;
West Sumatra.&#13;
11.   Community Forestry: To introduce community forests as one type of village land use.&#13;
WWF has already pioneered this approach in Keluru Village in Kabupaten Kerinci. It has the&#13;
dual benefit of providing the community with fuel wood and timber, as well as forming a buffer&#13;
zone on the Park boundary.&#13;
12.   Nurseries: To assist target groups or individuals to establish village nurseries for the&#13;
following commercial purposes: sale of fruit or timber tree seedlings to fellow villagers; sale of&#13;
palm tree seedlings to PHPA for marking the Park boundary; sale of seedlings to Dinas PKT for&#13;
use in regreening and reforestation.&#13;
13.   Rattan Plantations: To explore the possibility of establishing village rattan plantations to&#13;
replace rattan that is currently being harvested in the Park. Initial research by Stephen F. Siebert&#13;
of the University of Montana indicates that the clustering rattan, Calamus exiles could be grown&#13;
sustainably in the project area because this species resprouts after harvesting. The small canes&#13;
are used primarily for handicrafts.&#13;
14.   Turpentine Tapping: To increase the practice of tapping pine trees for resin for sale to&#13;
turpentine factories. Many pines have already been planted for reforestation, and demand for&#13;
turpentine exceeds the supply of resin.&#13;
SMALL ENTERPRISES/INDUSTRY&#13;
15.   Rattan Handicrafts: To introduce rattan handicrafts more widely in the project area, and&#13;
expand the range of products and markets. this builds on an existing handicraft tradition.&#13;
16.   Village Industries: To explore the possibility of introducing small village industries such&#13;
as black-smithing or simple furniture making.&#13;
17.   Agricultural Processing: To explore the possibility of introducing simple agriculture&#13;
processing techniques to add value to cassiavera or other products.&#13;
&#13;

SOCIAL&#13;
18.   Scholarships: To provide scholarships for children in SMA villages to attend school in&#13;
nearby towns or cities to provide them with a better education, and to encourage them to move&#13;
away from their village when they reach adulthood.&#13;
19.   Land Titling: To assist selected villagers to obtain government ownership certificates for&#13;
their land. This would only be done in exceptional circumstances as titling is an expensive and&#13;
time-consuming process.&#13;
TOURISM&#13;
20.   Hospitality Training: To train village women in the cooking, sanitation, language and&#13;
hospitality needed to attract international visitors to their homes for a remote homestay&#13;
experience. WWF has already been successful in providing this training in the village from&#13;
which visitors begin the ascent of the Mount Kerinci.&#13;
21.   Guide Training: to provide young men with the necessary language, intercultural, and&#13;
nature interpretation skills to guide foreign visitors into the Park.&#13;
PUBLIC VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
22.   Access Roads: to build light traffic access roads to villages close to the existing road&#13;
network. Prior to approval, these roads would have to be evaluated for possible negative impacts&#13;
on the Park, through AMDAL process.&#13;
23.   Small Scale Irrigation Systems: To construct simple irrigation systems with village labor&#13;
to increase rice production in villages that border a stream or river.&#13;
24.   Drinking Water Supply Systems: To provide a reliable and clear source of drinking&#13;
water to the entire village to improve sanitation and reduce the amount of time needed to obtain&#13;
water.&#13;
THE SELECTION PROCESS&#13;
25.   The villages assisted by the project will receive a tree year cycle of intervention that&#13;
includes surveys, situation analysis, facilitation, planning, implementation, and monitoring.&#13;
These steps will be repeated during each year of the cycle as a learning experience for the&#13;
villagers, and to allow mid-course corrections to be made. All sub-components would be&#13;
integrated into this process.&#13;
26.   The village intervention process is guided by the Kabupaten Coordinator in consultation&#13;
with the Camat. Activity proposals would be reviewed through the standard GOI process that&#13;
includes the LKMD at the village level and the UDKP at the Kabupaten level before being&#13;
submitted to the Kabupaten Coordinator. Facilitation will be done by LCOs and local NGO&#13;
staff, and the Community Participation Advisor and the WWF supervisor would provide periodic&#13;
assistance. Kabupaten technical agencies would implement development activities. The TAT&#13;
would assist village leaders and target groups to write activity proposals in the DUP format.&#13;

PROJECT SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
The matrix below indicates the mix of specialties and frequency and duration of missions&#13;
likely to be needed to ensure adequate project supervision. The footnotes suggest some of the&#13;
key events requiring particular attention of the supervision missions.  Some underlying&#13;
assumptions for the matrix are as follow:&#13;
Bank supervision input:&#13;
*  Regular supervision needs for the review of progress reports, procurement actions,&#13;
correspondence, etc. are estimated to require six staff weeks per year (n=t shown in&#13;
the matrix). In addition, specialized review time depending on which year will be&#13;
required to deal with key project activities (biodiversity assessment, MIS/GIS,&#13;
regional and spatial planning, training, village agreements and its land use, etc.) and&#13;
key events (project start-up i.e. finalization of project indicators, review of TORs of&#13;
TA and agency coordination, MTR i.e. para 4.10 of SAR main report, ICR, etc.).&#13;
*  Each of the four provinces should be visited at least once per year, including typical&#13;
project actions (village development, park zonation, boundary adjustments, social&#13;
forestry etc.).&#13;
*  Staff from the Resident Mission (both from PMU and ESIU) would assist in the&#13;
supervision of this project, in particular in nursing along start-up activities related to&#13;
boundary rationalization and biodiversity assessments in concession areas, random&#13;
ex-post review of SOE documentation, particularly village infrastructure investments&#13;
and attending PCC/IPCC meetings.&#13;
Borrower's Contribution to Supervision:&#13;
*  A one-day overall project launch workshop in Sungai Penuh is to be organized by&#13;
GOI in about June 1996, followed by a two-day provincial workshop (between July&#13;
and October, 1996 pending on critical TA mobilization) in each of the four&#13;
provincial capitals.&#13;
*  The KS Working group for Project Steering Committee and PSC to meet as needed&#13;
and the meetings for IPCC, PCC and DCC will be held normally in January/February&#13;
of each year to discuss previous year project performance and current year program&#13;
*  The monitoring and project data base will be coordinated through the park director in&#13;
Sungai Penuh, including the (semi)-annual progress reports.   The project&#13;
coordination consultant for the TA, would, apart from the TA procurement&#13;
monitoring also be involved in project reporting/supervision.&#13;

PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
The project indicators are grouped into two categories:&#13;
(a)   implementation indicators (these are related to the implementation schedule in&#13;
Annex 6).  When this input/output system will be set up by the various&#13;
implementation agencies during the first project year it will rely heavily on the&#13;
initial physical and institutional parameters set out in the SAR (e.g. cost tables in&#13;
Annex 9, phasing of village investments in WP 3 of Annex 12, number of key&#13;
events shown as dated covenants e.g. road construction moratorium). It covers&#13;
indicators such as procurement technical assistance progress, disbursement, staff&#13;
appointment, biodiversity areas surveyed both in the park as well as the forest&#13;
concessions, availability of funds for each of the components. The physical&#13;
progress will be monitored as set out in WP 5 of Annex 14 and reflected in a&#13;
progress reporting system. Technical assistance for the setting up of the project&#13;
monitoring system, including the performance indicators, is included in the&#13;
project and initial assistance will also be provided by environmenta] GIS staff&#13;
from ENVLW. The setting up of project indicators by project staff will receive&#13;
the highest priority during the three project launching workshops and the draft&#13;
indicators shown in Table I would be reviewed with each of project units,&#13;
PIMPROS and technical assistance staff.&#13;
(b)   impact indicators. The project is based on the application of instruments&#13;
(such as boundary rationalization; restriction of fragmenting infrastructure within&#13;
the Park area, particularly roads; income generation in potentially encroaching&#13;
buffer zone communities; conservation management in neighboring forest areas;&#13;
improved technology and human resources in park management) to the basic&#13;
objective, which is to protect the Kerinci Seblat Park environment and&#13;
biodiversity, and that of its immediate environs. It will be possible to monitor&#13;
the extent to which the instruments are developed and applied: the rate at which&#13;
boundaries are agreed and demarcated; improvements in community and farm&#13;
incomes; physical and human resource developments in the park management&#13;
structure; habitat and forest stabilization in the Park; decline in poaching&#13;
activities and illegal hunting and trapping of large mammels and birds as&#13;
indicator of improved park protection; developments in the forest concessions.&#13;
These aspects will be included in the project's M&amp;E system but will require&#13;
constant reassessement during project implementation. Although the instruments&#13;
chosen are believed to be the best possible in this case, it will nevertheless be a&#13;
difficult and time consuming task to directly assess their contribution to&#13;
biodiversity and habitat survival, and other major factors involved in protection&#13;
of the Park environment as a whole. It will take many years, for example, to&#13;
deternine whether sustainable production with an acceptable degree of&#13;
conservation and protection, is being achieved within the forestry concessions-&#13;
and other environmental trends will be similarly slow in emerging. It should not&#13;
&#13;

be assumed, therefore, that all major impacts from the project will be in full&#13;
evidence prior to the end of the project period. Remote sensing and other&#13;
technologies can be applied to the task of longer term environmental impact&#13;
assessment, and decisions will need to be taken on the extent to which this can&#13;
and should be done as the project is implemented.&#13;
(c)    With respect to the economic performance indicators, the project will only&#13;
attempt to measure those related to the area/village development component as&#13;
both the park management, and the concession biodiversity assessment&#13;
components do not lend themselves to such application.&#13;

REGIONAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF MAJOR CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
A Brief Description of the Biodiversity of the Kerinci Seblat Area&#13;
1.    The Kerinci Seblat ICDP proposal is located in the southern half of Sumatra in the&#13;
provinces of Jambi, South Sumatra, Bengkulu and West Sumatra. It extends for a distance of&#13;
nearly 350 km along the spine of the Barisan Mountain Range from Padang in the north to&#13;
Bengkulu in the south, and includes Indonesia's second highest mountain, Mt. Kerinci, at 3,805&#13;
m. The natural ecological communities of the Kerinci Seblat area are of outstanding biodiversity&#13;
significance: including species-rich lowland dipterocarp forests at elevations from 300 m to&#13;
1,000 m; unique wetlands, and subalpine communities at almost 4,000 m. These ecological&#13;
communities support a rich flora and fauna:&#13;
*  at least 4,000 species of plants, including Rafflesia, the world's largest flower,&#13;
Amorphophallus, the world's tallest flower, and the only natural occurrence of the&#13;
genus Pinus in the southern hemisphere;&#13;
* 144 mammalian species including several threatened or endangered species such as&#13;
Sumatran rhino, tiger, elephant, tapir, and gibbons;&#13;
* 180 bird species (2 percent of the world's total), including three species of hornbill,&#13;
the rare Kerinci Scop's owl and the great argus pheasant;&#13;
*  19 animal species endemic to Sumatra - 14 birds and 5 mammals.&#13;
2.    Kerinci Seblat was initially proposed as a national Park by the Minister of Forests in&#13;
1982. This initial proposal, comprising an area of 1,484,650 ha, was a consolidation of separate&#13;
blocks of conservation reserves and protection forests.  A series of subsequent boundary&#13;
revisions has reduced the Park by about to its present size of 1-1.3 million ha. The biodiversity&#13;
value of the Kerinci Seblat area is threatened by the reduction in Park area and by a host of&#13;
development pressures, such as access proposals, encroachment for shifting cultivation and&#13;
cinnamon plantations, and logging in the lowland forests.&#13;
Regional Impact Assessment: Definition and Purpose&#13;
3.    As the name implies, a regional assessment (RIA) is an analysis of the consequences of&#13;
one or more development projects, where the project or projects are anticipated to have&#13;
significant environmental, social or economic effects far beyond their immediate locality. RlAs&#13;
are particularly appropriate where impacts affect a number of different sectors and require a&#13;
coordinated management response, or where effective impact management requires policy or&#13;
institutional change. RIAs fall into two broad categories:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -                            ANNEX 1I&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
(a)   assessment of the cumulative impacts of a number of development projects on a&#13;
geographic region, and the design of a common, coordinated impact management&#13;
program to guide the activities of government and the various project&#13;
components; and&#13;
(b)   assessment of the impacts of single large project with extensive environmental,&#13;
land use and socio-economic development implication, the management of which&#13;
requires significant policy, administrative and fiscal responses from national and&#13;
local governments.&#13;
4.    The Kerinci Seblat RIA clearly belongs in the second category, and its purpose has been&#13;
to evaluate the following:&#13;
(a)   the extent to which the ICDP design meets basic objectives for natural resource&#13;
and biodiversity conservation;&#13;
(b)   the potential impacts of adjacent development activities on biodiversity&#13;
conservation and Park integrity; and&#13;
(c)   the impacts (positive and negative) of the Kerinci Seblat ICDP design on&#13;
opportunities for future economic development.&#13;
5.    Reflecting these objectives, the main RIA document contains the following chapters: a&#13;
description of the existing environmental and social setting for the Kerinci Seblat area; a&#13;
description of the ICDP proposal; a critical analysis of project design; and an assessment of the&#13;
impact of the project on regional development opportunities.&#13;

6.    The majority of the boundary revisions alluded to above have excised species-rich&#13;
lowland and low elevation hill forests. The areas have been reclassified from nature reserve or&#13;
protection forest to production forest, and placed in adjacent logging concessions. A comparison&#13;
of the original boundary with the currently boundary reveals that there has been an overall&#13;
reduction in the area of low elevation systems of 72 percent, however, some important systems&#13;
have suffered much higher loss: plains systems reduced by 81 percent, and the larger alluvial&#13;
valleys so important to many wildlife species reduced by more than 99 percent. The proportion&#13;
of mountain systems, with lower biological productivity and biodiversity, has risen from 67&#13;
percent to 86 percent. Overall, of 27 landscape units (based on differences of climate,&#13;
topography and lithology) identified as representative of the original Park, 15 have been reduced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 7&#13;
by 80 percent or more and 8 have been completely eliminated. The boundary is currently the&#13;
single most critical issue of project design. The Park has lost a significant proportion of its&#13;
biodiversity and may no longer contain the habitats necessary for the long-term protection and&#13;
maintenance of its "flagship" wildlife species - elephant, tiger, rhinoceros, tapir, gibbon and the&#13;
wealth of lowland evergreen rainforest birds. Adjacent lands are being subjected to such serious&#13;
disturbance from logging and such rapid deforestation by encroachers that they may loose much&#13;
of their biodiversity and buffer zone function. If the situation is to be retrieved, a number of&#13;
steps must be taken immediately.&#13;
(a)    Demarcation of the current boundary should proceed in order to expedite Park&#13;
gazettement, but there must be a clear statement from the Government of&#13;
Indonesia that the boundary is recognized as inadequate and that major boundary&#13;
rationalization to improve its biodiversity status will take place progressively&#13;
over the next five years.&#13;
(b)    A rapid environmental appraisal, involving biodiversity and wildlife habitat,&#13;
must begin immediately to determine the most important areas for repatriation to&#13;
the Park, concentrating on the Jambi and Bengkulu Park boundaries. Work&#13;
should begin immediately, utilizing remaining JGF funding, on two concessions&#13;
adjacent to the Park, one in Jambi and one in Bengkulu, with the following&#13;
selection criteria: high biodiversity; large proportion of protection and limited&#13;
production forest; and/or lease expiring within the next two years. Candidates&#13;
for these first appraisals are the Sarestra II and Nusa Leases in Jambi and the&#13;
Bina Samaktha and Maju Jaya Raya leases in Bengkulu. These two appraisals&#13;
should be undertaken as part of the concession reviews, see below, and be&#13;
completed by December 1996 with firm recommendations for the transfer of low&#13;
elevation areas of high biodiversity back to the Park.&#13;
Enforcement&#13;
7.    From even a casual field trip around the Park boundary, it is evident that encroachment&#13;
by agricultural squatters is now largely uncontrolled, and that greatly upgraded capability to deal&#13;
with the problem is needed immediately. In addition it is also evident that serious wildlife&#13;
poaching occurs in many areas of the Park. The project design calls for 100 new pack guards to&#13;
be engaged as "pegawi proyek" at 25 per year for four years starting in 1996. By the time this&#13;
force becomes effective it may well be too late for many areas inside the Park boundary, let&#13;
alone areas of value adjacent to the Park. It is therefore recommended that, prior to project&#13;
appraisal, the Government of Indonesia develop an effective bridging enforcement strategy to be&#13;
implemented in priority areas; starting in April 1995 and continuing until new project staff are&#13;
trained and in place. The strategy should contain: (1) a description of legal enforcement&#13;
procedures; (2) staffing levels and responsibilities; and (3) a summary of enforcement actions to&#13;
date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 4 of 7&#13;
Encroachment and Resettlement&#13;
8.    Generally the tools available to deal with existing Park encroachment are to amend the&#13;
Park boundary, to demarcate and enforce enclave boundaries, or to resettle/relocate. These will&#13;
have to be applied on a case-by-case basis after careful study during the first few years of project&#13;
implementation. Decisions should take into consideration criteria such as the impact on wildlife&#13;
management and biodiversity conservation, sustainability of the cropping practice, whether the&#13;
use is compatible with Park or buffer zone management criteria, and the potential reversibility of&#13;
the vegetation change. In addition the traditional attitude of Park managers that "people have no&#13;
place in parks" must change. Indigenous people who have lived in a region for decades or&#13;
centuries should be considered an integral part of the local ecology. Their customs and the way&#13;
they relate to natural systems becomes an added "biodiversity value." If relocation is the most&#13;
appropriate and desirable option, every effort should be made to encourage the persons or&#13;
community to relocate voluntarily. This can be accomplished by providing an acceptable&#13;
relocation site and adequate compensation for shifting, and by allowing continued use of the&#13;
original site for a set period through the "kebun kehidupan" concept of temporary utilization&#13;
zones.&#13;
9.    It is clear that at present there is neither sufficient information to assess the impacts of&#13;
individual encroaching communities not the staff capability to plan and manage a community&#13;
resettlement program. For these reasons the following implementation steps are recommended:&#13;
(a)   Immediate measures must concentrate on the stabilization of the Park and forest&#13;
concession boundaries to ensure no new encroachment takes place, through the&#13;
interim enforcement strategy recommended above.&#13;
(b)   No further resettlement of established individuals or communities should occur&#13;
for three years pending completion of the Park management plan and wildlife-&#13;
biodiversity studies and encroached areas, unless the request comes unsolicited&#13;
from the people. The wildlife-biodiversity studies should establish objective&#13;
criteria for assessing the impacts of communities living and farming inside the&#13;
Park and establish priority areas where resettlement may be required. Terms of&#13;
reference for these studies should be sent to the World Bank for review prior to&#13;
project appraisal.&#13;
(c)    Resettlement should be contemplated only where communities jeopardize&#13;
biodiversity values that are still intact, where there is a likelihood of permanent&#13;
human/wildlife conflict or where the community occupies land with significant&#13;
potential for the rehabilitation of habitat values. Wherever possible, resettlement&#13;
should be voluntary and carried out in accord with a Resettlement Action Plan&#13;
prepared in consultation with the affected people. An objective economic&#13;
analysis of both the earnings of current agricultural practice and the potential&#13;
earnings of the alternatives available to encroaching communities (i.e.,&#13;
transmigration and pohon kehidupan) should be prepared and submitted to the&#13;
World Bank in year one of project implementation.&#13;
&#13;

Page 5 of 7&#13;
(d)    Where communities remain in the Park, they should do so under a formal Park&#13;
use contract. Every effort should be made to accommodate these communities in&#13;
Park management programs and to capitalize on the tourism potential of their&#13;
culture and way of life.&#13;
IMPACTS OF OTHER DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES&#13;
Forest Management&#13;
10.   As previously noted, many of the areas of the original Park proposal excised by the&#13;
current boundary were reallocated to timber concessions even though they were classed as, or&#13;
met the criteria for, protection forest. The majority of the concessions around the boundary of&#13;
Kerinci Seblat are now wholly or largely within protection forest, and past enforcement against&#13;
encroachment has been so inadequate that intact forest on some concessions now exists only in&#13;
steep hill systems. Logging in such systems is invariably extremely destructive both to the forest&#13;
and to watershed values. The following recommendations are made with respect to forest&#13;
concession management within the Kerinci Seblat buffer zone:&#13;
(a)    A one year moratorium should be in place on the logging of any areas classed by&#13;
RePPProT as Protection Forest within the original 1982 Park boundary, pending&#13;
priority application of the KPHP analysis to forest concessions on both the Jambi&#13;
and Bengkulu boundaries of the Park; such analysis to be completed by&#13;
December 1996. The KPHP analysis should be synchronized with the rapid&#13;
environmental appraisals referred to under Park boundary recommendations;&#13;
(b)    Upon completion of the KPHP and rapid environmental appraisals, area of high&#13;
biodiversity or conservation value outside the rationalized concession boundaries&#13;
will be repatriated to the Park.&#13;
(c)    Areas of intact forest not required for the Park and not suitable for industrial&#13;
logging techniques should be placed in community forests where local people&#13;
may harvest minor forest products or hand log commercial timber species on a&#13;
sustainable basis under a buffer zone use contract administered jointly by local&#13;
government and the Park authorities.&#13;
Roads&#13;
11.   New roads or even upgrading of existing tracks have potentially significant implications&#13;
for both Park management and biodiversity conservation, since they provide access to new&#13;
settlers and opportunities for the expansion of existing agricultural activities through access to&#13;
new markets.  There are few if any examples in Indonesia of effective prevention of&#13;
encroachment when new roads have been constructed into areas of natural forest. Current road&#13;
"proposals" fall into two categories: first, "roads of convenience" that transect the Park, linking&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                            ANNEX I 1&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
communities that already have road access; and second, roads to enclave communities inside the&#13;
Park which do not now have road access. There are about seven proposed roads which fall into&#13;
the first category. These, with attendant human encroachment, pose by far the more serious&#13;
threat to Park integrity; potentially fragmenting the Park into isolated blocks, disrupting animal&#13;
migration, and preventing the flow of genetic resources. It is recommended that:&#13;
(a)   No new roads will be approved or constructed in or through the Park pending&#13;
completion of the Park management plan and a regional (buffer zone) land use&#13;
and transportation plan agreed to by all four provinces. Road construction should&#13;
also be predicated on the strengthening of enforcement capability to prevent&#13;
encroachment.&#13;
(b)   Any road proposals that may be deemed acceptable in the Park and buffer zone&#13;
plans must be subject to rigorous environmental assessment and project&#13;
justification through a full AMDAL report.&#13;
(c)    The unpaved 3 km of the proposed Muara Labuh-Kambang road should be&#13;
stabilized with proper drainage controls and put to bed under a temporary&#13;
vegetation cover pending a future decision on its acceptability.&#13;
Mineral Resource Development&#13;
12.   Only three mining concessions are now said to exist within the Park or surrounding&#13;
buffer zones. Two of these companies, P.T. Barisan Tropical Mining (gold) and P.T. Ketahun&#13;
(gold/copper), are undertaking feasibility studies and one, P.T. Lusang Mining, is still at the&#13;
exploration stage. The following recommendations are made with respect to mining activity:&#13;
(a)   No further mining concessions should be granted by the Ministry of Mines and&#13;
Energy within both the areas included in the original 1982 Park boundary and&#13;
the hatched area shown in Figure 10 until the final boundary of Kerinci Seblat is&#13;
decided.&#13;
(b)   Feasibility studies and controlled mineral exploration on the three existing&#13;
concessions should be allowed to continue in the Park on the understanding that&#13;
if no economically viable mineral potential is determined within five years, the&#13;
concessions will be canceled without compensation.&#13;
(c)   If mineable mineral deposits are found, the acceptability of mining will be&#13;
determined on a case-by-case basis through the AMDAL process. The following&#13;
limitations should be considered for any potential mine project: (i) no open pit&#13;
extraction would be allowed inside the Park or a 5 km buffer zone; (ii) all mine&#13;
infrastructure must be located outside the 5 km buffer; and (iii) equipment,&#13;
worker and ore transport within the Park and buffer must be by a method other&#13;
than road (i.e., overhead bucket or rail tram). Where a potentially viable mine is&#13;
now allowed to proceed, compensation will be limited to exploration expenses&#13;
only.&#13;
&#13;

(d)    Any ore processing in the area should be by a closed-circuit cyanide process with&#13;
a built-in cyanide destruction system (e.g., Inco SO2). Consideration should be&#13;
given to the subsidized processing of ore belonging to small alluvial gold miners&#13;
in order to lessen their dependence on mercury in and adjacent to the Park.&#13;
The Impact of the ICDP on Regional Development Opportunities&#13;
13.   This section of the RIA was impossible to complete with accuracy and technical rigor&#13;
because of existing project design uncertainties, such as the boundary, and real information&#13;
deficiencies. What is evident is that, in its current form, the ICDP project has few opportunity&#13;
costs because the land area has major use limitations. Steep topography and the poverty of&#13;
dominant soils are major constraints to sustainable agriculture. Almost two thirds of the area of&#13;
existing forest concessions meet the soil, slope and rainfall intensity criteria for protection forest,&#13;
and in theory should not be available for commercial timber production. Continued logging of&#13;
these areas will have serious implications for future forest production and watershed stability.&#13;
Earlier economic analysis (DHV Report 8, 1993) probably significantly overestimated the&#13;
economic opportunity cost of the ICDP project to agriculture and forestry because it assumed&#13;
wrongly that existing land uses and levels of resource exploitation were largely sustainable.&#13;
14.    The impact of the Park and ICDP on mineral resource development is expected to be&#13;
minimal, though this can not be confirmed until the three existing concessions complete&#13;
feasibility studies accommodating the restrictions recommended above.  Because all three&#13;
projects overlap the Park boundary or lie outside the Park, these restrictions should not present&#13;
serious problems to an economically viable precious metal deposit.&#13;
15.   The recommended restrictions on access development must be placed in the context that&#13;
no community outside the Park boundary currently lacks road access. Even the enclaves inside&#13;
the Park, legal and illegal, are serviced by tracks and many have flourished with such access for&#13;
decades. The current road access proposals transecting the Park are primarily stimulated by&#13;
inter-provincial competition for the marketing, processing and shipment of commodities,&#13;
primarily cassiavera, from the Kerinci Valley. Such considerations are likely to result in costly&#13;
duplication of access and should not be allowed to jeopardize Park and biodiversity values.&#13;

INCREMENTAL COSTS OF BIODIVERSITY&#13;
CONSERVATION&#13;
1.    Summary. The proposed GEF Grant of US$ 15.0 million equivalent (net of&#13;
taxes) would finance elements of the project that contribute wholly or largely to achieve-&#13;
ment of global biodiversity objectives. It is estimated that the "baseline" project scenario&#13;
(without global benefits) would cost about US$ 26.5 million, while the cost of the "GEF&#13;
alternative" (including global benefits) is estimated at US$ 46.0 million. A comparison&#13;
of project costs for the Baseline Scenario and GEF Alternative results in incremental&#13;
costs of about $19.5 million for achieving biodiversity conservation and sustainable use&#13;
objectives in KSNP and its buffer zones.&#13;
2.    Baseline Scenario. Under the baseline scenario, it is assumed that GOI would&#13;
maintain management and enforcement activities in and around KSNP at historical levels&#13;
(based on expenditure trends over the past 10 years). With respect to area/village devel-&#13;
opment expenditures, the baseline scenario includes planned rural infrastructure programs&#13;
for villages in KSNP buffer zones over the next 6 years; however, as these programs do&#13;
not address biodiversity conservation or sustainable use objectives, it is assumed for base-&#13;
line purposes that GOI would also initiate watershed protection programs in the project&#13;
area. Currently, supervision of timber concession management in the KSNP buffer zones&#13;
is inadequate, so it has been assumed for baseline purposes that GOI would begin to ad-&#13;
dress this weakness by investing in field programs and personnel to bring the situation&#13;
under better control. In the absence of the proposed project, limited monitoring and eval-&#13;
uation activities would have been undertaken in the project area. The cost of proposed&#13;
baseline activities is estimated at $ 26.5 million.&#13;
3.    Activities and expenditures under the baseline scenario are compatible with sus-&#13;
tainable development in the project area and national and social development objectives.&#13;
Although baseline activities would result in the protection of critical watersheds and&#13;
stricter enforcement of logging regulations on private concessionaires, they would be&#13;
insufficient to halt Park encroachment (human and road development) and to integrate&#13;
biodiversity conservation concerns into forestry management practices in the buffer zone.&#13;
This would lead to further biodiversity loss and habitat fragmentation in and around the&#13;
KSNP (particularly in the bordering concessions). Continued degradation and poor man-&#13;
agement in the Park and buffer-zones over the long term would result ultimately in the&#13;
loss of these ecosystems' habitat and biodiversity conservation functions. It is believed&#13;
that the most effective way to prevent such biodiversity loss is through regionally-based&#13;
programs, fully supported by local stakeholders, such as will be tested under the proposed&#13;
Kerinci Seblat Integrated Conservation and Development Project (ICDP).&#13;
&#13;

4.    GEF Alternative. With GEF/Bank financial assistance, GOI would be willing to&#13;
undertake a much more ambitious protection/buffer zone development program in and&#13;
around the Kerinci-Seblat National Park with the explicit objective of conserving biodi-&#13;
versity resources and assisting local villagers to shift to environmentally sustainable&#13;
forms of economic behavior (the ICDP model). Park management and enforcement&#13;
would be strengthened, and efforts would be intensified (with NGO support) to resolve&#13;
human conflicts and minimize encroachment into the Park. Area/village development&#13;
activities would be specifically oriented to assisting villagers living in and around KSNP&#13;
shift to economic livelihood activities that would be compatible with habitat and&#13;
biodiversity conservation both inside and outside Park boundaries. Biodiversity assess-&#13;
ments and community forestry activities in the logging concessions would lead to incor-&#13;
poration of certain blocks into the Park and/or ensure their conservation under concession&#13;
management. Intensive monitoring and evaluation activities would be instituted to permit&#13;
documentation of trends related to the impact of project activities on participating&#13;
villages and peoples and on the area's biological resources. The cost of the GEF&#13;
Alternative is estimated at $ 46.0 million.&#13;
5.    The GEF Alternative, in addition to producing national sustainable development&#13;
benefits, would secure the biodiversity of the Park and its buffer zones, which include&#13;
threatened lowland and hill forests as well as montane habitats. KSNP and its surround-&#13;
ing forests provide one of the last opportunities in Southeast Asia to conserve a diverse&#13;
and complex mammal predator-prey system. The strengthening of Park management and&#13;
protection, the involvement of local communities, and the integration of conservation&#13;
values into forestry management practices are expected to effectively increase the conser-&#13;
vation estate by maintaining natural habitat beyond Park boundaries. The project will&#13;
develop a model for integrated conservation and development programs, which could be&#13;
applied to other parks in the Indonesia protected area system (and elsewhere in Asia).&#13;
6.    Incremental Costs. The costs of the Baseline Scenario and the GEF Alternative&#13;
are presented below, by major project component (in US$/million):&#13;

The comparison of Baseline Scenario costs ($265 million) with the costs of the proposed&#13;
GEF Alternative ($46.0 million) results in an incremental cost of achieving global&#13;
benefits of about $19.5 million. The GEF grant of $15.0 million would contribute&#13;
substantially to financing these incremental costs. Given the associated (non-quantified)&#13;
national benefits from improved ecosystem functioning that the GEF Alternative would&#13;
generate, the GOI has indicated its willingness to finance the residual incremental costs of&#13;
roughly $4.5 million out of non-GEF (IBRD loan) resources.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
1.    As indicated in the main text of this report, aspects of the benefits from the project are&#13;
difficult to quantify, in the conventional sense. The methodology used to evaluate the benefits of&#13;
direct investment in biodiversity and conservation within the KNSP area is discussed in the main&#13;
text of the report: this annex deals with the estimation of returns to investment in the Village&#13;
Development and the Integrating Biodiversity in Forest Concession Management components.&#13;
Village Development Investments&#13;
2.    The Village Development Component of the project represents the largest expenditure&#13;
category for the project - US$27 million, consisting of investments in village infrastructure, and&#13;
grants for agricultural activities, as detailed in Annex 4 of this report.&#13;
3.    Although these investments are designed largely on the basis of reducing the impacts of&#13;
encroachment onto the KNSP area by surrounding populations, this component uses a&#13;
methodology to achieve that end which involves improving incomes in communities which are&#13;
marginalized, and poor. It also uses a participatory approach which means that the details of&#13;
some of the agricultural activities which will be sponsored under the project will not be decided&#13;
until the project is under implementation and consultation activities regarding the village land&#13;
use plan are in progress. Moreover, these activities will vary widely from one location to&#13;
another, so ex ante valuation of returns is problematical.&#13;
4.    Within these limitations, and also with some allowance for judgment on the proportion of&#13;
total project overheads which can be assigned to this component, an indicative evaluation of&#13;
costs and benefits for this component can be made.&#13;
5.    Investments under this component will, as noted above, consist of infrastructure&#13;
improvement, which is expected to have a general upward impact on agricultural and other&#13;
economic activities in the target areas, and specific agricultural production investments. It is&#13;
important to note that investments in infrastructure improvements and agricultural productivity&#13;
are incremental and additive. This can be shown in the graph of the production function below,&#13;
where K is infrastructure capital and Y is output.&#13;

Page 2 of 6&#13;
Investments in infrastructure capital, AKO, bring about an increase along the curve of AY0,&#13;
whereas investments in knowledge expansion (through extension, demonstration, access to&#13;
improved seeds, etc.) would imply a shift of the production function (AY,). This implies that&#13;
there is no double counting involved in the rate of return calculations of infrastructure and&#13;
agriculture investments.&#13;
6.     Evaluation of returns to direct investment in various farming systems which will be&#13;
involved in the village investments have been made in the preparation process. The crop budgets&#13;
and farming system models used to estimate the benefits are shown in Technical Report 3 of&#13;
Annex 14 of the Preparation Report. The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) to incremental&#13;
benefits from irrigation intensification is estimated at 53% pa; to jungle rubber production it is&#13;
40%; to cassiavera (cinnamon) 97%; to oil palm 35%; and for an agroforestry alternative, 34%&#13;
pa. For the purposes of evaluating this component as a whole, the rate of return to direct&#13;
investment (referred to in the accompanying tables as Initial Costs) in output producing activities&#13;
in agriculture in the target villages, and the complementary infrastructure improvement inputs, is&#13;
assumed to be the lower bound of these estimates -i.e. 34% pa.&#13;
7.     Because this project is concerned with a wider set of objectives than improvement of&#13;
village infrastructure and agricultural production, there is a high input of technical assistance and&#13;
other overhead expenses under the project. A significant proportion of this input will, however,&#13;
be used to ensure that the village investments are properly implemented and monitored - not only&#13;
for their impact on incomes on the target population, but also for their success in reducing&#13;
encroachment onto the KNSP area. In this analysis, 60% of total project technical and other&#13;
overhead expenses have been attributed to this component: this is about the proportion of total&#13;
project costs taken up by this component. There are also recurrent costs (for maintenance of&#13;
infrastructure and so on ) which will attach to both the Initial Costs and Additional Investment&#13;
Costs streams, through the total investment and benefit period considered in this case (25 years.).&#13;
8.     There is a large budget assigned in this project for Monitoring and Evaluation. The bulk&#13;
of this is intended to keep surveillance over the integrity of the Park boundary. However, some&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the village development investments will be&#13;
necessary and in this analysis it has been assumed that 25% of total monitoring and evaluation&#13;
costs are used for this.&#13;
9.     Table I below presents the base case data for an analysis of the ERR of the Village&#13;
Development component. The ERR resulting from the data and assumptions used in this case is&#13;
15.2 % p.a. Note that benefits are assumed to build gradually, and do not reach a maximu until&#13;
Year 7.&#13;
It should be noted that in Tables I to 4 below, values are shown only for years 1 to 8: in all&#13;
cases, all costs and benefits figures beyond year 8 are identifcal to those for year 8.&#13;

10.       The major risk factors associated with investments of this type are: (a) some significant&#13;
proportion of the target group will not participate in the project, so that the overheads incurred&#13;
have to be spread over a narrower group of beneficiaries; (b) benefits will be slower in emerging&#13;
than originally expected, and (c) actual benefits produced by the investments will be less than&#13;
those projected.&#13;

Integrating Biodiversity in Forest Concession Management&#13;
14.     The project will invest grant funds in ecological surveys and biodiversity assessments in&#13;
the forestry logging concessions bordering the Park. No attempt has been made to quantify these&#13;
benefits, although it is believed a positive flow of returns will result from these inputs. Given&#13;
the uncertainty of this outcome, however, it is unlikely that GOI would invest in such activities&#13;
at least until the benefits have been demonstrated.&#13;
15.     Under the inspection and monitoring activities in the project, considerable input will be&#13;
made into producing an effectively regenerating forest area, so that sustainable forest&#13;
management becomes possible. In September 1995, the Bank delivered a policy paper to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -                                ANNEX 13&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
Government of Indonesia' in which a case was made that the economic consequences of&#13;
persistence with current non-sustainable forest logging and use practices in Indonesia would be&#13;
significant, when compared with the outcome of using the same area of forest for sustainable&#13;
production.&#13;
16.    The results developed in that nation wide analysis can be applied on an adjusted pro rtla&#13;
basis, as follows:&#13;
(a) First, the basic parameter assumptions given in the Bank policy paper referred to in&#13;
footnote 1, are required:&#13;
*  FOB value of plywood                                     $380 per cubic meter&#13;
*  FOB value of sawn timber                                 $250&#13;
*  FOB value of other products (mouldings, furniture etc)         $600&#13;
*  real FOB price inflation rate for plywood and sawn timber 2% pa&#13;
*  real FOB price inflation rate for other products         2.8%o pa&#13;
*  logging and transport cost                               $45 per cubic meter&#13;
3  processing cost plywood                                  $155&#13;
p processing cost sawn timber                               $100&#13;
*  processing costs other products                          $350&#13;
(b) It is assumed that under sustainable forest use, there will be a faster adaptation by the&#13;
processing sector to raw material scarcity, so that recovery rates (i.e. produced out per&#13;
unit of log input) will rise earlier in the time series. Industry recovery rates move from&#13;
45% to 60 % by 2001 under the sustainable scenario, but reach only 50% by that year&#13;
under the non-sustainable scenario.&#13;
17.    Next, these estimates can be applied to the concessions bordering KSNP: Figures&#13;
gathered during the preparation of the Kerinci Seblat ICDP indicated that about 500 000 ha of&#13;
intact forest remains in the II concessions bordering the park. For indicative purposes, it can be&#13;
assumed that this resource will be used at the same rate, and for the same purposes, as applies&#13;
under current practices nationally: this will lead to depletion of the resource within a twenty year&#13;
period, with serious declines setting in after about ten years. This outcome can be compared to&#13;
the alternative of a lower initial rate of use which will be sustainable. In this case, it can be&#13;
assumed that the costs of attaining this lower rate of use will be more effective inspection and&#13;
monitoring, such as will be provided under the project. A net benefit stream can then be&#13;
calculated by subtracting annual profits from the non-sustainable current practice outcome, from&#13;
the equivalent figures for the sustainable outcome (taking the additional costs of inspection and&#13;
monitoring under the component). From this, rates of return can be derived. Table 5 below&#13;
shows the profit streams generated under the sustainable and non-sustainable scenarios for the&#13;
concessions.&#13;

18.   This procedure yields a rate of return from attainment of sustainability in the concessions&#13;
bordering the park of 15% pa. Given that this does not include any valuation of the biodiversity&#13;
benefits from the survey and other purely conservation based work for which costs are included&#13;
in this component, it is reasonable to suggest it is a conservative estimate of the real returns to&#13;
investment in this component, provided it is accepted that protection of the regenerating stands&#13;
can be achieved.&#13;
19.   The rate of return is reasonably robust, because it is calculated by comparison of two&#13;
income streams which are affected by the same variables. Thus, reduction of product prices or&#13;
raising of processing costs for outputs from the forests does not lower the ERR significantly: net&#13;
present value, however, is reduced (from $21.82 m to $15.83 m at a 12% discount rate) when&#13;
product prices are reduced by 20%. If it is postulated that coverage of the monitoring process is&#13;
less than complete, so that only half the forested area actually comes under sustainable&#13;
management as a result of the project, then again the rate of return is relatively unaffected, while&#13;
in that case the net present value of the project would be reduced considerably, to $9.9m still&#13;
substantially positive.&#13;

            The overall objective of the Kerinci
            Seblat Integrated Conservation and Development Project is to
            secure the biodiversity of Kerinci-Seblat National Park
            (KSNP) and stop further habitat fragmentation by: 1)
            improving Park protection and management, including the
            involvement of local communities; and 2) promoting
            sustainable management and the maintenance of permanent
            forest cover in the remaining buffer zone concession areas.
            The project will include four major components which are
            complementary to project objectives: 1) park management; 2)
            area and village development; 3) integrating biodiversity in
            forest concession management; and 4) monitoring and
            evaluation. Supporting activities are: 1) policy and
            planning; 2) training and community facilitation; 3)
            promotion of conservation awareness; and 4) studies.
