        *As of August 31, 2015; Includes Additional Financing of $3.3m, approved April 22, 2015.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     Environmental pressures in the Maldives stem from its fragile geography, coupled with rising population densities, increased tourism, and changing consumption&#13;
     patterns. The country faces growing problems with solid waste management and pollution from sewage and other effluents emanating from urban settlements, hotels,&#13;
     fish-processing plants, ships, and other sources. The quantities of solid waste generated exceed disposal and treatment capacity. In addition, habitat degradation&#13;
     threatens marine assets such as coral reefs, while terrestrial threats include timber harvesting and destruction of mangroves. These environmental challenges could&#13;
     hamper the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth especially if they undermine tourism.&#13;
&#13;
     This project aims to establish a solid waste management system to reduce the risks of contamination associated with accumulated wastes and sea dumping. It also&#13;
     seeks to build human and technical capacity for environmental management. The four components of the project are: (i) a regional solid waste management program&#13;
     in the North Province, which is under-served by waste management facilities; (ii) capacity building for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s environmental agencies and regulators to manage&#13;
     the needs of a fragile environment; (iii) technical assistance for strengthened environmental management and monitoring to expand the knowledge base regarding&#13;
     critical natural resources; and (iv) project management and communications.&#13;
&#13;
      In February 2014, the Bank approved the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s request for a one-year extension of the project closing date to end-June 2015, a reallocation of project funds&#13;
     among existing disbursement categories and related revisions to certain project aspects. The Board approved additional financing of $3.3 million in April 2015 to&#13;
     support some cost overruns and allow the project to meet its objective of establishing and utilizing an integrated regional solid waste management system, with a&#13;
     six-month extension to the project closing date. Some of the cost overruns are being borne by the government of Maldives.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:&#13;
     Components 2 and 3 were completed in 2013, including the creation of a cadre of trained civil servants, enhanced access to information from environmental&#13;
     monitoring and research to support planning processes, and community participation in environmental management in 100 percent of the targeted islands to exceed&#13;
     the project target of 50 percent.&#13;
     A waste incinerator has been built on the designated uninhabited island, and the residual waste transfer vessels are expected to be completed by November 2015. A&#13;
     consultant to provide hands-on training to Fenaka Corporation, the state-owned entity responsible for managing and operating the regional solid waste management&#13;
     system, is expected to be on board by early October 2015.&#13;
&#13;
     The projectâ&#128;&#153;s final target for the user fee collection in 50 percent of the participating islands under the original credit was achieved 1.5 years ahead of schedule. Overall,&#13;
     62 percent of households in the participating islands are anticipated to pay user fees by end of the project period. Forty percent of the islands are carrying out waste&#13;
     segregation and composting.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
This project is being implemented under the multi-donor Maldives CCTF that was established in 2009 to support a climate-resilient economy and society in the&#13;
Maldives through adaptation, mitigation, and low-carbon development. The first phase of the CCTF was funded by the European Union (EU) and the Government of&#13;
Australia, with a total allocation of $10.3 million. Three projects have been implemented under the CCTF to date, all completed on November 30, 2014:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The Wetlands Conservation and Coral Reef Monitoring for Adaptation to Climate Change Project ($3.8m) supported community-based wetland management&#13;
       including ecotourism and drainage management on Hithadhoo island (Addu/Seenu Atoll) and Fuvahmulah island (Gnaviyani Atoll), rainwater harvesting on&#13;
       Ukulhas island (North Ari Atoll), coral reef monitoring (North and South Male Atolls), and capacity building for the local government.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The Clean Energy for Climate Mitigation Project ($2.53m) supported solar energy generation, energy conservation and efficiency improvements, and technical&#13;
       assistance on G.Dh. Thinadhoo island.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The Ari Atoll Solid Waste Management Pilot Project ($1.33m) supported the development of an island-level integrated solid waste management system in five&#13;
       pilot islands of the Ari Atoll and a residual waste transfer system for off-island disposal.&#13;
With a supplemental EU contribution of â&#130;¬3.85m, a second phase of the CCTF (CCTF-II) is supporting the Climate Change Adaptation Project, aimed at helping the&#13;
government to further implement activities undertaken under the Wetlands Conservation and Ari Atoll projects in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s southern-most atolls (Addu and&#13;
Gnaviyani). The project aims, more specifically, to: (i) strengthen community wetland advisory boards in terms of formal recognition and institutional consolidation,&#13;
and provide a mechanism for their continued involvement and improved capacity; (ii) strengthen the web-enabled database system developed under the first phase of&#13;
the CCTF to ensure continued uptake, sustain confidence of tourist resorts in the National Coral Reef Monitoring Framework, and supplement it with a support facility&#13;
for resorts; (iii) expand the involvement of tourist resorts beyond coral reef monitoring to mainstreaming climate change into resort management; and (iv) set up a&#13;
system for waste management that is locally acceptable and operationally viable.&#13;
&#13;
KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:&#13;
Interventions in wetland management and solid waste management in the Addu and Gnaviyani Atolls are expected to benefit more than 4,800 households through&#13;
enhanced tourism, livelihood opportunities, and ecosystem conservation. The coral reef monitoring intervention will directly benefit at least 10 private tourism&#13;
operators. Through interventions in capacity building for mainstreaming of climate adaptation in island level planning, the project is expected to benefit all the 20&#13;
atoll councils and 66 island councils in the country and the communities serviced by these councils.&#13;

&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     The project supports the government of Maldives to develop the education sector, with special focus on primary and secondary education. The operation was prepared&#13;
     through a process of consultation and collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders: the Ministry of Education (MoE), MoFT, the atoll education agencies, public&#13;
     and private employers, public and private education institutions, academics, and school principals, teachers, parents, and students. Prior to this project, the Bank had&#13;
     undertaken rigorous policy and technical analysis through a programmatic series of education-sector reports, whose findings and recommendations were incorporated&#13;
     into the projectâ&#128;&#153;s design. The project includes three components: (i) national-level education development; (ii) school-level education development; and (iii) project&#13;
     management, monitoring and evaluation, and program development.&#13;
&#13;
     It is assisting the government in developing a system of national assessments of learning outcomes to inform education policy, and also conducting regular school-&#13;
     level quality assurance reviews to feed into school improvement activities. In addition, the project supports government efforts to develop a network of good quality&#13;
     secondary and higher secondary schools, and strengthen the human resource capabilities of education officials in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s atolls and the capital, Maleâ&#128;&#153;. The project&#13;
     is also helping the MOE prepare a master plan for the development of higher education.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The survival rate through higher secondary education has achieved the 2015 end target rate (20 percent).&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Eighty percent of schools in 42 percent of atolls have been trained and are currently engaged in quality assurance school self-evaluation and school-based profes-&#13;
            sional development activities.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      There are 45 MoE staff members who have completed certificate level short-term training courses, and 10 MoE staff who have commenced masters or bachelor&#13;
            degrees in education. The MoE has also commenced a set of degree, associate degree and diploma programs for school principals, deputy principals, and leading&#13;
            teachers, with 82 candidates currently enrolled in these programs.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The enrichment of physical learning environments of secondary schools has made substantial progress, with 23 secondary schools (out of 37 in the country)&#13;
            receiving information and communications technology equipment and associated material and software to date.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The MoE is scheduled to conduct the national assessment of learning outcomes in September-October 2015.&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
The project aims to enhance budget credibility, transparency, and financial reporting of central government finances. It will support three activities: (i) strengthening&#13;
the public financial management environment by enhancing the legislative and institutional framework, the fiscal framework, and debt and cash management; (ii)&#13;
strengthening the public accounting system to improve financial reporting practices and decision-making, as well as internal financial controls, internal auditing, and&#13;
procurement management practices; and (iii) providing support for project management within the MoFT.&#13;
&#13;
KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:&#13;
The expected outcomes of the project are: (i) reduced deviation between actual expenditures and the original budget; (ii) increased and timely public access to key&#13;
fiscal information; (iii) improved quality of debt data recording and reporting; and (iv) enhanced coverage and quality of the internal audit function.&#13;
&#13;
To date the project has:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Completed an analysis of the legislative framework relevant to PFM, and identified a sequenced plan of revising/amending the laws.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Upgraded the debt recording and reporting system, with the data reconciled; prepared a framework to issue sovereign guarantees, reviewed the draft National&#13;
       Debt Strategy with an aim to improving it; designed monthly and annual debt reports and conducted an assessment of the debt divisionâ&#128;&#153;s internal organization&#13;
       structure and made recommendations to strengthen it.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Trained MoFT staff on how to formulate a Medium-Term Macro-Fiscal Framework. Basic training has been delivered on macro-fiscal modeling to officers within and&#13;
       outside the MoFT, and a new Macroeconomic Policy Coordinating Committee has been established and an early draft macro-fiscal statement prepared.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Prepared a business blue print on budgeting and a new budget calendar. Budget ceilings have been established for the FY 2016 budget based on the initial&#13;
       macro fiscal statement.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Carried out urgent technical and functional upgrades in the public accounting system to closely monitor budget execution. System-generated budget execution&#13;
       reports comparing budgets with actual expenditures are being used, and commitments are gradually being captured in the system.&#13;

      **$4 million of IDA funds are being leveraged to provide $16 million of risk exposure in the form of a guarantee&#13;
&#13;
     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#13;
     The ASPIRE program aims to increase solar photovoltaic generation in the Maldives through private-sector investment. The program will use a combination of grant&#13;
     funds from SREP and a series of IDA guarantees to attract private-sector investments and build capacity within the country to receive such investments.&#13;
     Its components are: (i) technical assistance to the government to enable private investing and strengthen institutional capacity building and knowledge sharing; (ii)&#13;
     a series of IDA guarantees to provide confidence to private investors; and (iii) tariff buy-down to ensure that tariffs obtained are within an acceptable range for utility&#13;
     and customer acceptance.&#13;
&#13;
     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:&#13;
     About 20 MW of new power generation over the life of the program, beginning with four MW bid out for rooftop solar energy in the greater Maleâ&#128;&#153; area. Results to be&#13;
     monitored will include the cumulative MW capacity installed as well as private capital mobilized in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s PV sector.&#13;

            Maldives - Country snapshots
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Maldives was one of the world’s 20
            poorest countries in the early 1980s. Three decades later,
            its inhabitants enjoy the same levels of gross domestic
            product (GDP) per capita and human development outcomes as a
            middle income country. Maldives’ model of economic
            development has, however, not been inclusive and its future
            sustainability is at stake. Although this economic model
            based on tourism-led growth and redistribution of
            tourism-generated revenues has contributed to improving the
            wellbeing of the Maldivian population, poverty reduction has
            been below potential and the level of inequality - and lack
            of shared prosperity - remain a major challenge. Recent
            political and socio-economic developments have, moreover,
            brought to evidence the inherent vulnerability of Maldives’
            development and raise concerns about its fiscal,
            environmental, and social sustainability.
