REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA&#13;
STRATEGIC URBAN ROADS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. URBAN TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    Economic Development. Over the past ten years, the Indonesian economy has grown at more&#13;
than 6% per annum with growth in the past five years being slightly higher at close to 7%. Non-oil&#13;
manufacturing has provided the engine of growth with an average annual growth rate of 11.5% per&#13;
annum. In the process, the share of manufacturing in GDP increased from 14.6% in 1984 to 23.9% in&#13;
1994 while that of agriculture declined from 22.7% to 17.4% over the same period. Growth was most&#13;
rapid in provinces with a strong manufacturing base oriented towards exports, i.e. DKI Jakarta and West&#13;
and East Java. This is reflected clearly in the ports of Jakarta and Surabaya, which registered a doubling&#13;
in container traffic in less than four years. Under the Sixth Five Year Development Plan (REPELITA VI:&#13;
1994/95 - 1998/99) GDP is projected to grow at 6.2% per annum with the population growing at 1.6%&#13;
per annum. Non-oil exports are expected to continue driving the economy, in particular exports based on&#13;
industrial capital and human resources.&#13;
1.2    Demographic Trends. During the 1980s, Indonesia experienced one of the highest urban&#13;
growth rates in East Asia. Urban population increased from 33 million (22% of total population) to 55&#13;
million (31% of total population) between the censuses of 1980 and 1990. The urban population is&#13;
growing at over 5% per year - almost three times the overall national population growth rate. Indonesia&#13;
includes 15 large cities of more than 500,000 people, 40 secondary cities of over 100,000 (provincial&#13;
headquarters and incorporated municipalities), 200 towns of over 20,000 (district headquarters), and&#13;
about 3,200 service centers (subdistrict headquarters) with 3,000 to 20,000 people. Seven of Indonesia's&#13;
ten largest metropolitan areas are on Java. Current forecasts estimate an urban population of some 80&#13;
million or 40% of the total population in the year 2000. Outside the Jakarta metropolitan region, which&#13;
already has over II million people, 13 cities are forecast to have populations over I million, while&#13;
another II are forecast to have populations of over 500,000.&#13;
B. URBAN DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.3    Urban Infrastructure Issues. Average incomes in urban areas have risen substantially over the&#13;
past decade. However, income distribution remains relatively unequal. In 1990, more that 17% of&#13;
Indonesian urban dwellers were estimated to be in "absolute poverty" based on their expenditure levels.&#13;
The problems of low income are exacerbated by deficiencies in basic services and degraded&#13;
environmental conditions. Only about 20-25% of urban households have direct access to piped water&#13;
supply, another 15% buy drinking water from vendors or standposts, and the rest rely on shallow wells&#13;
and sometimes on surface water courses. These are generally polluted due to inadequately treated&#13;
wastewater. Only about 40% of urban households have access to adequate sanitation facilities. In the&#13;
larger cities, inadequate water supply and liquid and solid waste disposal are serious problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 2 -                       Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
1.4    Urban Infrastructure Constraints and Priorities. Urban areas in Indonesia face the following&#13;
essential constraints: (a) lack of coordination in integrating infrastructure investments with land&#13;
management and transport objectives; (b) no administrative status for local governments, other than the&#13;
largest cities (Kotamadya); (c) weak management of water enterprises; (d) poor financial management&#13;
systems (deficient accounting practices, inadequate cost recovery, weak revenue generation, and poor&#13;
information systems); (e) inefficient programming of design and construction cycles, often compressed&#13;
into single fiscal years; (f) complex relationships among local, provincial and central agencies with&#13;
respect to responsibilities for project and program preparation, appraisal, financing, implementation, and&#13;
O&amp;M; (g) a shortage of trained and experienced managers and technical personnel; and (h)&#13;
infrastructure deficiencies and backlogs in operations and maintenance (O&amp;M). All of these except (c)&#13;
and (d) also apply to urban roads. The Bank's 1993 Urban Public Infrastructure Services Report (No.&#13;
121 54-IND) estimated that the 1990 infrastructure investment backlog was at least some US$5 billion for&#13;
the main five subsectors (piped water, sanitation, solid waste, urban roads, and drainage). Further, a&#13;
substantial backlog prevails in the maintenance of facilities, which has resulted in decreased productivity&#13;
of previous infrastructure investments.&#13;
C. TRANSPORT TRENDS&#13;
1.5    Motorization. The economic development during the past decade has encouraged the ownership&#13;
and use of private vehicles and increased travel. The motorized vehicle fleet more than doubled in the&#13;
1980s in line with urban population growth. In 1989, 29% of urban households owned a motorized&#13;
vehicle, (around 3/4 of which were motorcycles) and 35% a nonmotorized vehicle. Motorcycles make&#13;
up almost 70% of the total motorized vehicle fleet, cars 15%, trucks and buses 15%.&#13;
1.6    With an average motor vehicle availability (excluding motorcycles) of 19 vehicles per 1000&#13;
population Indonesia is still in the early stages of motorization. But differences in motorization between&#13;
regions in Indonesia are marked (ranging from 23/1000 pop. for Java and Bali to 6/1000 pop. for Nusa&#13;
Tenggara). The differences between provinces are even more pronounced. In the Jakarta metropolitan&#13;
area, for example, vehicle availability at 150/1000 pop. is comparable to that in some of the more&#13;
developed countries in East Asia.&#13;
1.7    Based on the key determinants of income levels, income distribution and cost of ownership and&#13;
use, international experience suggests that nationally Indonesia is not expected to reach the exponential&#13;
growth phase of motorization in the short termn. However as incomes and cities continue to grow at high&#13;
rates, the motorized fleet will continue to increase, with cars gaining in share. The physical expansion of&#13;
cities has increased journey length and the demand for motorized travel. The numbers of vehicles and&#13;
traffic volumes are therefore expected to grow in and around urban centers, increasing demands on&#13;
transport systems and posing challenges for expansion of road network capacity.&#13;
1.8    Transport Activity. The strong growth in non-oil manufacturing was accompanied by rapid&#13;
growth in transport activity which increased by close to 7% per year over the past ten years. All&#13;
transport modes - road, rail, shipping, civil aviation, and inland waterways - were affected. In general,&#13;
the modes are complementary with each serving specific markets or transport needs. Competition&#13;
arnong them is limited to a few corridors. Sea transport moves large quantities of freight, mainly bulk oil&#13;
and coal carried by the oil and coal industries. General cargo movements by sea are comparatively&#13;
small, the predominant flows being between Java and the outer islands with Jakarta and Surabaya as the&#13;
focal points.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 3 _                   Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
1.9   For interurban transport of both passengers and freight by land, road is by far the dominant&#13;
mode. Interurban domestic freight movements (ton/km) grew by around 60% on Java and Sumatra&#13;
between 1982 and 1991. While data are not available on journey times, congestion and capacity&#13;
constraints are emerging in heavily trafficked corridors and are very visible in North Java. In particular&#13;
in 1992 it was estimated that of the total of 47 billion vehicle/km on national and provincial roads about&#13;
50% was in Java and Bali (which account for only 22% of the network). Average daily traffic has grown&#13;
rapidly since the early 1970s, ranging between 5% and 10% p.a. depending on the area. In recent years,&#13;
traffic growth as recorded by the annual traffic counting system has leveled off to about 5% on average.&#13;
Growth has been most dramatic on the approaches to the main urban centers and in particular on the high&#13;
capacity, limited access tolled roads approaching Jakarta (where annual growth of 15% to 30% has been&#13;
observed over the past five years).&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
1.10   Central Government. There is no single ministry responsible for urban development and no&#13;
single agency responsible for urban transport.  The National Development Planning Agency,&#13;
BAPPENAS, is responsible for overall planning and allocation of resources, focused within REPELITA&#13;
and Annual National Development Budgets (APBN). Within BAPPENAS, the Bureau for Urban&#13;
Development, Settlement and Public Housing, under Deputy V (Regional and Provincial Development),&#13;
is responsible for oversight and coordination of urban infrastructure development. Major road&#13;
development is the responsibility of Deputy III (Infrastructure).&#13;
1.11   The principal central ministries involved in urban transport are the Ministry of Home Affairs&#13;
(MHA), the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), the Ministry of Transport (MOT), and the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MOF). The MHA is responsible for oversight of the regional governments, primarily through&#13;
its Directorate General for Public Administration and Regional Autonomy (PUOD) and Directorate&#13;
General for Regional Development (BANGDA). The MPW (or DPU) is responsible for oversight of&#13;
most infrastructure. Within MPW, the Directorate General for Human Settlements (DGHS or Cipta&#13;
Karya) is responsible for oversight of city and regional planning, while the Directorate General of&#13;
Highways (DGH or Bina Marga) is responsible for oversight of roads and bridges.  The MOF is&#13;
responsible for central and local finance; the Directorate General for Budget (Anggaran or DGA)&#13;
administers budget transfers. Within MOT, the Directorate General of Land Transport (DGLT) has&#13;
overall responsibility for road traffic and transport matters.&#13;
1.12   Regional Government. There are 27 provincial (TK I) and 304 local (TK II) govenmments&#13;
which operate with increasing responsibilities and delegated authority. The 304 local governments&#13;
include 57 kotamadyas (urban municipalities) and 247 kabupatens (districts). Legislative powers at both&#13;
provincial and local levels are held by elected People's Representative Councils (Dewan Perwakilan&#13;
Rakyat Daerah).&#13;
1.13   Under Indonesia's unitary system of govermnent, all units of regional govemment are overseen&#13;
by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Provincial governments are headed by appointed governors who&#13;
represent the President and the central govemment. The govemors also head the semi-autonomous&#13;
provincial administrations.  Walikotas (municipal mayors) and Bupatis (district heads) represent&#13;
provincial governments, and head their own local governments. Development Planning Agencies&#13;
(BAPPEDA I and II) report directly to their respective governors, mayors, or district heads and are&#13;
responsible for planning and resource allocation. Govemment services at TkI and TkII are provided by&#13;
separate departments (Dinas I and II) analogous to line ministries of the central government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads infrastructure Project  - 4 -                    StaffAppraisal Report&#13;
1.14 Finances of provincial and local governments have long been dominated by central government&#13;
transfers and are characterized by weak local resource mobilization, low per-capita budgets and limited&#13;
use of credit for capital investment. Grants and other revenue sharing mechanisms used by GOI are&#13;
being used to resolve the disparity between increasingly decentralized service responsibilities and local&#13;
resource mobilization. Restructuring of central-local government financial relationships and improved&#13;
fiscal capacities for local governments in Indonesia are topics of on-going policy dialogue which are&#13;
gaining increased urgency as growth in urban services requirements outpace local capacities to respond.&#13;
Local government borrowing capacities are generally quite limited and incentives to borrow are weak in&#13;
the current financing pattern although some capable local governments are willing to accelerate their&#13;
development program by borrowing.&#13;
1.15   Urban and Regional Planning.  GOI has a National Structure Plan (Strategi Nasional&#13;
Pengembangan Pola Tata Ruang), which includes the regional planning goals for particular areas.&#13;
Provincial structure plans incorporate the concept of Regional Development Areas (RDAs) which appear&#13;
to be purely conceptual. Local urban plans in Indonesia may be developed through several avenues,&#13;
which may lead to inconsistent local plans and uncoordinated road projects. Provincial governments&#13;
produce and local governments contribute to Guidelines of Provincial Policy, (Pola Dasar Pembangunan&#13;
Daerah) often the basis for land use and development within urban areas. Local governments through&#13;
their planning units (Bappeda Tk II) prepare, often in conjunction with IUIDP/IUDP projects, broad&#13;
structure plans for the area of their responsibility. These plans indicate in a broad way desired future&#13;
road, public transport and other infrastructure. Local governments also control building approvals and&#13;
may have local regulations (Perda), for example, for imposing setbacks on buildings from roads and&#13;
controls on access to roads.&#13;
1.16   Highways. DGH is the central authority with overall responsibility for the development and&#13;
maintenance of the nation's highways. However, there is an ongoing process of decentralization of&#13;
central government functions to provincial and kabupaten/kotamadya governments. In broad terms the&#13;
focus of DGH's responsibilities is on the overall planning and monitoring while at the lower-tier road&#13;
agencies the focus of responsibilities is on implementation.&#13;
1.17   Since August 1994, DGH has had six directorates reporting to the Director General, three of&#13;
which are responsible for planning, design and urban roads respectively, and three of which are regional&#13;
directorates responsible for implementation. The Directorate of Urban Road Development (BINKOT) is&#13;
composed of five sub-directorates. Two are responsible for road development and design respectively,&#13;
and two for implementation in metropolitan and large cities. A fifth sub-directorate is responsible for the&#13;
planning of all toll roads, whether urban or inter-urban.&#13;
1.18   Urban Roads. Primary arterial roads in urban areas are included in the national road network&#13;
and are managed centrally through DGH and expenditures are programmed through the Integrated Road&#13;
Management System (IRMS) system as for National and Provincial roads. (Primary arterial roads&#13;
provide links between provincial (level 1) cities or between these cities and the Level 11 cities). All other&#13;
urban roads are the responsibility of the municipal government (Level II) with technical guidance from&#13;
DGH. Design and construction standards, and cost estimations are based on the DGH guidelines. Some&#13;
guidelines on road planning, and the programming of operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) expenditures&#13;
have been developed with Bank support. Guidance on economic evaluation for projects is given in a&#13;
DGH manual. The larger road projects are still often financed directly from the national budget&#13;
(APBN/DIP) with design and supervision by the Regional Betterment Offices (RBO) of Bina Marga.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 5 -                    Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
However responsibility for land acquisition of these projects rests with local government and can lead to&#13;
financial obligations which the local governments are not capable of meeting without special assistance.&#13;
1.19   Until now, systematic surveying and expenditure programming of the urban networks has not&#13;
been formalized. An Urban Road Management System (URMS) to aid municipalities in this function,&#13;
initially for maintenance expenditures, is under development by DGH through the HSL2 project. Apart&#13;
from central statistics on the roads, the first forrnal inventory of urban roads in 306 cities of over 20,000&#13;
population was conducted in 1993. The most urgent problems relate to traffic congestion which is severe&#13;
on 36% of urban arterial and collector roads so that capacity expansion and traffic management are key&#13;
policy aspects requiring attention.&#13;
1.20   Urban Traftic and Transport. Within MOT, the Directorate General of Land Transport&#13;
(DGLT) has overall responsibility for road traffic and transport matters. It comprises three directorates:&#13;
Infrastructure Systems Development, Traffic and Transport, and Safety and Engineering. Each of these&#13;
three directorates includes at least one sub-directorate dealing with road-related matters. Safety and&#13;
environmental matters for all land transport modes are handled by a single sub-directorate of safety.&#13;
This functional organization structure has not proven very effective and changes are under consideration,&#13;
including creating a section for urban traffic and transport.&#13;
1.21   In principle the role of bGLT at the center should be focused on policy formulation and&#13;
coordination with all executing functions delegated to decentralized entities.  MOT's regional&#13;
organization is based on a single office (Kanwil) in each province dealing with all transport modes. Each&#13;
Kanwil has at least one section handling land transport matters. DLLAJ, coming under the provincial&#13;
administration are responsible for, among other things, traffic signs and signals, motor vehicle&#13;
inspection, vehicle weight and dimensions, have existed for a number of years in the larger provinces and&#13;
are gradually being established throughout the country.&#13;
1.22   Enforcement of road traffic and transport regulations is divided between the DLLAJ and the&#13;
Traffic Police. The enactment in 1992 of a modern Road Traffic and Transport Law (Law 14) followed&#13;
by the main implementing regulations in 1993 represented a major milestone. These regulations&#13;
provided for the establishment of local government DLLAJ nationally, with responsibilities including&#13;
urban transport planning, road and public transport network planning, and traffic management.&#13;
Implementation has remained slow, with only three DLLAJs established by the end of 1995 in Java.&#13;
E. THE ROAD NETWORK&#13;
1.23   Past Development. In line with economic growth, Indonesia's classified road network has&#13;
expanded rapidly in the past 25 years, from 82,125 km in 1969 at the start of the five-year plans, to&#13;
244,164 km in 1994 at the end of REPELITA V. The urban road network more than doubled in length&#13;
during the 1980s. Road length has been increasing in line with the overall increase in the vehicle fleet,&#13;
and the numbers of urban households. Urban road length at around 25,500 kms is around 11% of the&#13;
total road length in Indonesia. They are carrying 44% of the 47 billion motorized vehicle kilometers of&#13;
annual travel. Of all urban roads 3772 kms or 15% are national primary roads.&#13;
1.24   The road networks in Indonesian cities are typically of low density (road km per capita) and are&#13;
becoming increasingly congested especially on Java. In considering road capacity it is important to note&#13;
that the majority of the roads are of low geometric standard, i.e. less than 7m wide. In addition, there is&#13;
extensive frontage development along main roads from towns and cities continuing for many kilometers.&#13;

Frontage development reduces traffic speed and lowers road capacity as a result of traffic entering and&#13;
leaving the road, parked vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles.&#13;
1.25   Future Requirements. Analysis of road capacity and traffic flow for the national and provincial&#13;
network indicates that a growing number of road sections are near capacity. As detailed in the recent&#13;
Roads Sector Study (Report no. 15394-IND), expansion of road capacity by small widenings of roads is&#13;
probably inappropriate. However new larger road investments needed require much longer preparation&#13;
times, typically on the order of three to five years, than has been the case for the traditional smaller&#13;
betterment investments. This results from the requirements for more elaborate planning; feasibility&#13;
studies including full analysis of options; the assessment of environmental and social impacts and&#13;
preparation of a mitigation action plan; land acquisition; resettlement; and greater coordination and&#13;
collaboration within GOI agencies.&#13;
1.26   In 1994, 22% of the interurban network and 58% of the urban network had congestion sufficient&#13;
to warrant consideration of widening. In order to offset the costs of such congestion it is estimated that&#13;
in the decade 1995-2004, some capacity expansion could be economically warranted for up to 28,000 km&#13;
(45%) of national and provincial roads and 4,500 km (34%) of urban roads. Expansion opportunities on&#13;
urban roads are limited by the much higher costs of land acquisition and by planning and social&#13;
constraints.  Therefore, capacity expansion has to include an effective combination of traffic&#13;
management, road widening, new roads and bypasses.&#13;
1.27   Funding. The higher levels of expenditure required for capacity expansion of the interurban and&#13;
urban networks (and reconstruction Kabupaten roads) could be achieved through reallocation of public&#13;
resources between different categories of road and programs for efficiency improvements. Provided a&#13;
suitable regulatory framework is in place, private sector resources could also be mobilized for some&#13;
bankable projects mostly on Java. Furthermore, there are considerable opportunities for more efficient&#13;
implementation of programs. Factoring in resource and implementation capacity constraints, a 10%&#13;
increase in overall road funding for capacity expansion is recommended in the Road Sector Study.&#13;
F. GOVERNMENT URBAN STRATEGY&#13;
1.28   For the 1990s, the key elements of GOI's development strategy are (i) maintaining growth and&#13;
macroeconomics stability; (ii) improving public sector management; (iii) enhancing private sector&#13;
development; (iv) reducing poverty and enhancing human resource development; and (v) improving&#13;
environmental management. Investment in transport is a part of the GOI strategy to help foster the&#13;
attainment of its objectives by providing adequate infrastructure. In its successive REPELITAs, the GOI&#13;
has devoted significant resources to improving transport infrastructure. Outlays for maintenance were&#13;
increased in order to sustain the quality and productivity of the transport.&#13;
1.29   Facing large deficiencies in urban infrastructure and a fast-growing urban population, in 1987,&#13;
GOI issued a Statement of Policies, representing a consolidated view of development in the sector. It&#13;
includes: (a) strengthening local governments to build, operate and maintain local services;&#13;
(b) improving the planning and programming of urban infrastructure investments; (c) mobilizing local&#13;
revenues and optimizing their use; (d) implementing coordinated financing and administration systems&#13;
for local services; and (e) strengthening consultative processes at various levels of government,&#13;
particularly the participation of municipalities and districts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 7 -                   Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
1.30   The Policy Statement called for Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Programs (IUIDP)&#13;
as the operational approach for achieving the above objectives. These comprised action plans for local&#13;
institutional strengthening (Local Institutional Development Action Plan or LIDAP), improvements in&#13;
local resource mobilization (Revenue Improvement Action Plans or RIAP), and medium-terrn&#13;
expenditure programs (PJM), and financing arrangements. The World Bank, ADB and bilateral donors&#13;
have supported GOI in a nation-wide program for IUIDP preparation and implementation since 1987.&#13;
More than 75% of local governments have so far adopted the IUIDP approach.&#13;
1.31   REPELITA VI and the second 25-Year Plan, both of which started in April 1994, emphasize&#13;
sustainable urban development With goals of improved quality of life, increased urban productivity,&#13;
poverty alleviation, and reduction of regional imbalances. The main objective to meet these goals is to&#13;
address the backlog in the provision of basic urban services. Infrastructure to support economic&#13;
development is considered to be crucial. Management of land as a strategic resource, including effective&#13;
development control, is seen as important as investment in infrastructure. The Strategy to achieve these&#13;
goals includes effective institutional development (clarification of roles and responsibilities,&#13;
management systems, Planning, Programming and Budgeting Systems (PPBS), and human resource&#13;
development), clarification of the legal framework for decentralization, and resource mobilization,&#13;
including private sector and community participation. REPELITA VI also expands the IUIDP approach&#13;
into an Integrated Urban Development Program (IUIDP) that includes, amongst other things, broader&#13;
spatial and urban planning in addition to public works infrastructure development plans.&#13;
1.32   An important GOI objective for the infrastructure sector in REPELITA VI is to enhance the role&#13;
of the private sector in the provision of public services which is a growing phenomenon in East Asia.&#13;
Bank advice has been sought in three areas, namely shifting the appropriate balance between public and&#13;
private roles; developing sector policy and regulatory framework; and analyzing financial (including&#13;
debt) implications. The Bank has helped prepare framework papers for private participation in power,&#13;
ports and solid waste management. Workshops for central and regional government officials have been&#13;
organized in these sectors as well as water supply where GOI is seeking to involve private operations&#13;
both in operation and financing but progress has been slow to-date.&#13;
G. GOVERNMENT TRANSPORT POLICIES&#13;
1.33   Policy Statement and Action Plan (PSAP) on Road Infrastructure. Following a review of&#13;
past policies, and recommendation of a number of studies, the GOI prepared in 1989 a comprehensive&#13;
Policy Statement and Action Plan (PSAP) on Road Infrastructure and Road Traffic and Transport. The&#13;
Policy Statement covered seven main areas: legal and regulatory reform; institutional development and&#13;
coordination; integration of transport sector policy formulation and planning; planning, programming,&#13;
and execution of road works; road user taxation; vehicle weight and dimension limits; traffic safety.&#13;
Specific actions to be taken during the period 1990-1992 are focused primarily on interurban transport&#13;
and were included in the Stage I Action Plan, which was supported by the Highway Sector Project (Loan&#13;
3133-IND). The Stage II Action Plan covering the period 1993-1996 is supported by the Bank's Second&#13;
Highway Sector Investment Project (HSL 2, Loan-3945-IND). Further details of the PSAP are available&#13;
in Annex 2 of the HSL 2 SAR (Report no. 12161-IND).&#13;
1.34   Cost Recovery. Under its Road Traffic and Transport PSAP of 1989, GOI adopted a "user&#13;
pays" approach to charging for road use. Nationwide, an aggregate cost recovery factor of 1.13 was&#13;
achieved by 1994/95 through a combination of fuel prices increases, a restructuring of the annual vehicle&#13;
registration fee, increases in the fee for commercial vehicles, and a start to phasing out of the ownership&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 8 -                       StaffAppraisal Report&#13;
transfer tax. Aggregate road expenditures are recovered from all vehicle categories combined. However,&#13;
when cost recovery is considered by individual category the picture remains unbalanced as more than&#13;
three-quarters of tax receipts still accrue from small gasoline-engined vehicles. Taxes on trucks which&#13;
cause most of the road damage and require the construction of strong road pavements remain marginal.&#13;
The annual registration fee rather than encouraging greater efficiency in the road transport system, is still&#13;
to a certain extent penalizing vehicle types which cause less damage but more congestion.&#13;
1.35   Urban Roads. There is no single document that sets out current GOI polices for urban roads.&#13;
However a good understanding can be obtained from the Policy Statement for Urban Development&#13;
(1987), the Policy Statement and Action Plans on Road Infrastructure and Road Traffic and Transport,&#13;
and statements on the urban sector and urban transport in REPELITA VI. More specific Government&#13;
strategy in relation to urban roads is set out in the Ministry of Communications' (MOT) elaboration of&#13;
REPELITA VI.&#13;
1.36   Policy development and implementation for broader urban transport issues have been limited in&#13;
Indonesia.  This results from  fragmentation of institutional responsibilities, a general lack of&#13;
coordination within central government, and inadequate responsibility and strength to deal with&#13;
financing and implementation of urban transport policy and projects across all modes within local&#13;
governments (even DKI Jakarta). Despite the current lack of a coherent action plan for urban transport,&#13;
many useful but isolated initiatives are under way. A most useful initiative is the recent creation in&#13;
BAPPENAS of an Interministerial Working Group (IWG) to analyze urban transport policy and to&#13;
develop by mid 1997 an urban transport policy to be included in urban policy being prepared for the&#13;
period of REPELITA VII.&#13;
1.37   Toll Roads. GOI initiated a policy of developing a network of high capacity limited access&#13;
motorways through toll revenues in the late 1970s. The first toll road was opened to traffic in 1978 and&#13;
in the same year Jasa Marga, the state toll road corporation, was established as the sole entity to&#13;
construct and operate toll roads and given authority to raise funds by public bond issues. The key&#13;
principles underlying the Government's toll road policy have been that:&#13;
*   road facilities in the more developed parts of the country can be financed through&#13;
contributions from road users (justification on equity grounds);&#13;
*   a free alternative road has to be available to road users; and&#13;
*   toll rates shall not be higher than 70% of the savings road users gain from traveling on the&#13;
toll road.&#13;
1.38   Between 1978 and 1990 some 280 km of toll roads and three tolled bridges were opened to&#13;
traffic. These facilities were concentrated in the Jakarta area in the form of urban express ways and&#13;
roads radiating from Jakarta. Jasa Marga's sources of funds for these investments consisted of bond&#13;
issues on the domestic market, foreign loans arranged by the government and toll revenues. Loan&#13;
financing took the form of loans from international development agencies (including the Bank) to GOI&#13;
that were onlent to Jasa Marga.&#13;
1.39   Private Sector Participation in Toll Roads. Private participation is sought in areas of high&#13;
growth where private investment is economically and financially feasible. The main stated policy&#13;
objective on private participation in toll roads is to obtain additional funding. References were also&#13;
made to faster procurement and implementation. By regulation (No 8 of 1990) all private investment in&#13;
toll roads is to be in the form of cooperation with Jasa Marga. The suggested form of cooperation is a&#13;
joint venture or joint operation which are GOI's selected forms of cooperation or "working together"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 9 -                         Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
with the private sector. To implement the policy, an administrative procedure - involving DGH, the Toll&#13;
Road Corporation, and the Ministry of Finance - for discussing and negotiating agreements with private&#13;
parties was established. Implementation of the policy, however, was not formulated in detail, and it&#13;
proceeded on an ad-hoc basis. A revised - but still not well codified - procedure was instituted in early&#13;
1995 for the implementation of a new program of private participation in toll roads under the current five&#13;
year plan.&#13;
1.40   By mid- 1995 some 200 km of toll roads involving private sector parties had been completed or&#13;
were under construction. Total financing for toll road schemes involving private participation over the&#13;
period 1990/94 is estimated at some US$555 million or about 5% of the US$11.4 billion of GOI&#13;
financing for all public roads combined over the same period. Under REPELITA VI the government is&#13;
seeking a contribution of US$3.1 billion from the private sector for toll road financing.&#13;

2. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. PAST INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1    The Bank has a long standing association with GOI, in the urban and urban transport sectors. In&#13;
the mid 1980s the Bank contributed analytical inputs to policy development leading to the urban policy&#13;
statement of 1987, which was supported by an Urban Sector Loan (Ln. 28167-IND). Since the mid&#13;
1980s there has also been a series of investment projects. Two of these namely the Regional Cities Urban&#13;
Transport Project (LN. 2817-IND, RCUTP) and the JABOTABEK Urban Development Project&#13;
(Ln. 2932-lND) focused on urban transport, including road construction. In the 1990's, urban road&#13;
development and traffic management are also a significant component of Integrated Urban Infrastructure&#13;
Development Projects (IUIDP) for the East Java/Bali UDP (Ln. 3304-IND), Sulawesi/Irian Jaya UDP&#13;
(Ln. 3340-IND), Surabaya UDP (Ln. 3726-lND), Semarang/Surakarta UDP (Ln. 3749-IND), and&#13;
Kalimantan UDP (Ln. 3854-lND).&#13;
2.2   The Bank has also financed a series of road projects during the past two decades. The projects&#13;
supported development of the national, provincial and kabupaten (local government) road networks.&#13;
Four are under implementation - Third Kabupaten Roads (Ln. 3490-IND), Eastern Indonesia Kabupaten&#13;
Roads (Ln. 3579-IND), Fifth Kabupaten Roads (Ln. 3732-IND), and the HSL-2 (Ln. 3712-IND).&#13;
Lending has been directed at three broad objectives:&#13;
*   improving the quality of the road network through maintenance, rehabilitation,&#13;
improvement (minor widening) and new road construction.&#13;
-   developing the capability of the road agencies at central and local level&#13;
-   strengthening the capacity for road sector policy formulation and implementation, and&#13;
improving road sector policy through support for the GOI Policy Statement and Action Plan&#13;
on Road Infrastructure.&#13;
Annex 1 lists previous urban infrastructure and road projects.&#13;
B. PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE&#13;
2.3    The project implementation record for transport projects in Indonesia has been solid. The six&#13;
most recently completed projects were rated satisfactory by the Department and by OED in terms of&#13;
overall outcome and sustainability. The institutional impact of the six was rated substantial in three&#13;
cases, moderate or partial for three, and negligible for one, the Regional Cities Urban Transport Project&#13;
(RCUTP), discussed in para. 2.6. In the current road portfolio of five projects, all are rated satisfactory&#13;
in terms of development objectives, and all but one (HSL-2) are rated satisfactory in terms of&#13;
implementation progress. The unsatisfactory rating is due to delays in procurement and in preparing&#13;
subprojects caused by weak project management. The longer term prospects for achieving a satisfactory&#13;
rating are good. The project management and oversight arrangements for this project (see section 6)&#13;
have been designed to minimize the potential for delays.&#13;
2.4   For the portfolio of recently completed urban projects, all three were rated satisfactory by the&#13;
Department and OED in terms of overall outcome. Sustainability was mixed, and institutional impact&#13;
moderate or substantial. All six projects in the current urban portfolio are rated satisfactory in terms of&#13;
development objectives, and all but one (Third JABOTABEK Urban Development Project, JUDP-3, Ln.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infiastructure Project  -  1I -                     Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
3246-[ND) are rated satisfactory in terms of implementation progress. The JUDP-III unsatisfactory&#13;
rating is due to a major procurement irregularity on the KIP program in DKI Jakarta involving contracts&#13;
totaling about $20 million. This project is being supervised attentively and its prospects for achieving a&#13;
satisfactory rating by June 1996 are good.&#13;
C. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.5    Bankwide experience with urban road projects is that strong institutional arrangements are the&#13;
key to project success and sustainability. This is bome out in Indonesia. Civil works for road projects&#13;
have generally been completed on time and to an adequate quality standard. Audit reports confirm that&#13;
the projects have been well justified and are sustainable. This can be attributed to the strength and&#13;
continuing improvement in the capability of road agencies. The Directorate General of Highways (Bina&#13;
Marga) has developed into a strong and capable central agency. Even so, civil works undertaken in both&#13;
road and IUIDP projects have generally been limited to routine maintenance, rehabilitation, widening&#13;
and improvement on existing alignments, with limited new works or realignment. Urban road&#13;
components in IUIDP have suffered from a lack of longer termn plans and construction programs.&#13;
2.6    RCUTP is the previous project closest in scope to SURIP. The main lessons learned from&#13;
RCUTP are set out in the recently completed Project Completion Report (Report No. 1 5245-IND). This&#13;
report indicates that although the civil works were successfully completed and staff trained at the local&#13;
government level, sustainable capacity was not created at a local level to undertake similar works in&#13;
future.  The ascribed cause was the delay in enacting enabling regulations for devolution of&#13;
responsibilities for transport planning, road programs and traffic management from central to local&#13;
government. These regulations are now in place, and GOI is proceeding with the establishment of the&#13;
necessary road traffic and transport units (DLLAJ) in all local governments.&#13;
2.7    Bankwide experience is that to achieve major and sustainable improvements in the capability of&#13;
road agencies, institutional development components require:&#13;
*   considerable Bank staff input over an extended period of time;&#13;
*   well prepared and detailed implementation arrangements;&#13;
*   continuing attention and support from Govemment decision makers; and&#13;
*   a flexible approach which will provide for the improvements to take account of, and be&#13;
integrated into Government systems and procedures.&#13;
D. BANK STRATEGY&#13;
2.8    The Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed in March 1995 for Indonesia has five&#13;
main objectives:  reducing poverty, managing resources sustainably, enhancing human resource&#13;
development, maintaining growth with macroeconomics stability, enhancing competitiveness. It seeks&#13;
infrastructure investment that supports private sector development and competitiveness, strengthens&#13;
capacities at all levels of government and decentralizes responsibilities. It seeks to improve public sector&#13;
management and environmental management. These are key objectives of relevance to urban transport.&#13;
2.9    The Bank's Country Study, Indonesia Environment and Development of July 1994 (Report&#13;
No. 12083-IND), discusses urban transport and the control of vehicle emissions. It indicates that&#13;
reducing the rate of growth of congestion and the number of vehicles in key urban centers will be critical&#13;
to minimizing efficiency losses and to protecting the health and welfare of the urban population. The&#13;
study states that an effective strategy would need to include key elements of land use planning,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 12 -                      StaffAppraisal Report&#13;
improving the communications network (expanding the urban road network should receive a high&#13;
priority), traffic management and engineering, technical options for vehicles and fuels, improved public&#13;
transport, and demand management.&#13;
2.10   In the urban sector, the Bank has oriented its overall sector lending to assist GOI to deliver&#13;
adequate urban infrastructure investments in cost effective ways.  In promoting efficient urban&#13;
development, the Bank's strategy supports the expanded IUIDP approach. However implementation&#13;
should include both sectoral and integrated approaches as appropriate. While all plans should be&#13;
integrated, in some cases implementation could be handled through separate sectoral projects. For&#13;
example in smaller municipalities multisectoral projects are generally of manageable size and&#13;
complexity. An integrated approach would therefore be more appropriate. In other cases, where the&#13;
requirements of a particular sector are sufficiently large and complex, both in technical terms as well as&#13;
on policy, institutional and financial matters, sectoral projects within the framework of an integrated plan&#13;
may be better.&#13;
2.11   The Bank's urban sector strategy also promotes establishing an enabling regulatory and planning&#13;
framework for urban land management. A key focus of the Bank's strategy will be to support GOI&#13;
efforts to establish an effective land management system and simplify other regulations to facilitate more&#13;
efficient and environmentally sound urban land use and strengthen land tenure. The Bank is helping the&#13;
Government develop improved implementation frameworks for addressing environmental and social&#13;
impacts of urban projects.&#13;
2.12   Urban Transport. The context for the Bank's working strategy on urban transport in Indonesia&#13;
is provided by the Country Assistance Strategy, the Country Environmental Study and the Urban Sector&#13;
Strategy. The framework is provided by the Technical Paper on Urban Transport in Asia (1994), and the&#13;
Bank Transport Sector Policy Review presented to the Board on September 22, 1995. The basic thrust of&#13;
this working strategy is to support through physical works and TA components in sectoral and integrated&#13;
investment projects, GOI initiatives for:&#13;
Implementation of existing GOI transport policies in urban areas, including: improving road&#13;
safety, integrating transport planning and urban planning and mitigating the adverse social and&#13;
environmental impacts of motorization;&#13;
Formulation of GOI urban transport policy at national and local levels that supports a path of&#13;
development that is economically, financially, environmentally and socially sustainable;&#13;
Implementation of action plans for these GOI policy initiatives in metropolitan regions and&#13;
other urban areas in which the Bank is funding projects;&#13;
Institutional development of central and local government capacities to formulate and&#13;
implement Urban Transport Policy, and to support GOI initiatives for decentralization of these&#13;
activities to local government;&#13;
Human resource development for policy formulation, urban transport planning, traffic&#13;
management, public transport planning and operations, air pollution monitoring and control,&#13;
environmental and social assessment, management and monitoring; and&#13;

E. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.13   Indonesia has been successful in generating economic growth of 7% a year over the past ten&#13;
years, and as a result is experiencing rapid urbanization and rapid motorization. A number of donors,&#13;
including the ADB and OECF are assisting GOI initiatives to manage these processes of rapid&#13;
urbanization and motorization. This project fills a gap of major strategic importance in the road and&#13;
urban portfolios of the donors. The project is designed to complement the projects being funded by other&#13;
donors in particular the recently approved ADB North Java Road Improvement Project (ADB Loan&#13;
1428-INO), as well as projects funded by GOI from their own resources.&#13;
2.14   The Bank is currently involved in operations which are related to this project. The HSL2&#13;
provides a range of support for the roads sector, and includes the upgrading of some interurban sections&#13;
of the national primary arterial road network.  Urban projects under implementation and under&#13;
preparation in a number of cities include components for upgrading and expansion of the urban road&#13;
networks. SURIP helps bridge a serious policy and institutional gap. Developing and implementing&#13;
sustainable transport policy will require cooperation and coordination between different GOI Ministries&#13;
and agencies (MPW, MOT, BAPPENAS, BAPEDAL), different agencies in MPW (Bina Marga, Cipta&#13;
Karya), different sections of Bina Marga, and different levels of Government. The Bank is well placed&#13;
to act as a catalyst and to facilitate this cooperation given its pioneering role in IUIDP/IUDP and HSL 2.&#13;

3. THE NORTH JAVA CORRIDOR&#13;
A. URBAN DEVELOPMENT&#13;
3.1    Setting. The 750 km long North Java Corridor (NJC) follows the gentle terrain of the northern&#13;
coastline of the provinces of West, Central and East Java. It is generally constricted to a relatively&#13;
narrow coastal plain between the volcanic backbone of Java and the Java Sea which historically has been&#13;
a center for human settlement. The NJC is anchored by two major conurbations. To the west, the&#13;
megacity of JABOTABEK, comprising DKI Jakarta, and the municipalities of Bogor, Bekasi and&#13;
Tangerrang in West Java province. To the east, the more compact but rapidly growing city of Surabaya,&#13;
Indonesia's second largest city (and also an international gateway) in the East Java province. The&#13;
intermediate towns and cities of Cirebon (an important port), Tegal, Pekalongan and Semarang and other&#13;
smaller towns are all dynamic growth centers with strong mutual linkages and with their economic&#13;
hinterlands. Surabaya is the regional center for the surrounding cities including Gresik and Malang and&#13;
accordingly generates extensive interaction between them.&#13;
3.2    Economic Development. Indonesia's real GRDP per capita doubled from 1983 to 1989. This&#13;
was also the case for DKI Jakarta. However, real per capita GRDP grew at a slightly higher rate in the&#13;
provinces of Java. GRDP per capita of these three provinces was about 35% of that for Jakarta and about&#13;
80% of that for Indonesia in 1989.&#13;
3.3    Demographic Trends. The bulk of the population growth on Java is expected to occur in&#13;
JABOTABEK and greater Surabaya. JABOTABEK is forecast to grow from 17 million in 1990 to&#13;
30 million in 2005. Over the same period greater Surabaya is forecast to grow from 8 million to&#13;
14 million. While the overall population of Central Java is forecast to grow little, the urban population is&#13;
forecast to grow substantially, particularly of the major towns and cities.&#13;
B. OVERALL TRANSPORT DEMAND&#13;
3.4    The NJC is served by both road and rail. In addition, airline services exist for travel between&#13;
DKI Jakarta, Cirebon, Semarang, Surabaya and the towns of Surakarta and Yogyakarta to the south. The&#13;
Land Transport Development Plan Study Phase II Study (LTDP-II) made broad estimates of the demand&#13;
for interurban transport from 1982 to 1991 shown in Table 3.1. Interurban passenger transport demand&#13;
grew at 7.2% per annum.&#13;
3.5   In the short to medium term, the likelihood of significant changes in the railway's market share&#13;
is not good on grounds of rail capacity. The key mainline sections of the railway in Java are now being&#13;
operated close to or at capacity. Developing Java's railway to a stage where it is capable of carrying a&#13;
much increased share of future interurban passenger traffic and of general and other freight traffic will&#13;
require major investments in double-tracking and/or signaling and far reaching institutional and policy&#13;
reforms, both of which will take a considerable time to be completed. The initial steps now being taken&#13;
by Government will not in themselves have any significant impact on the demand for road transport in&#13;
the short to medium term.&#13;

3.6    For the long tern, rail has the potential to play a much expanded role in interurban passenger&#13;
transport in Java. With larger traffic volume the relative cost advantage of rail improves. Furthermore,&#13;
as road transport causes much higher external costs on account of congestion, pollution and accidents,&#13;
charging for these costs would also work in favor of rail transport. Rail could help, therefore, in meeting&#13;
the growth in transport demand and in alleviating the adverse consequences of exponential growth of&#13;
motorization. For general freight movements over short, medium and most long (by Indonesian&#13;
standards) distance, road transport will continue to be the most economical mode, particularly since the&#13;
geographical pattern of industrial development is being shaped largely by the expanding toll road&#13;
network. For long distance bulk movements, shipping, if a technical option, will remain far more&#13;
economical than rail.&#13;
C. ROAD TRANSPORT NETWORK&#13;
3.7    The principal route for road traffic traveling between Jakarta and Surabaya is currently the road&#13;
paralleling the north coast via Semarang and Tubang. The North Java Transport Corridor study found&#13;
that most Jakarta - Surabaya traffic, which may only be 10% of traffic on an intermediate link, uses this&#13;
road. Much of this route currently consists of two lane highway sections. Traffic volumes in the corridor&#13;
range from about 10,000 to 20,000 vehicles annual average daily traffic (AADT) of which commercial&#13;
vehicles (light goods vehicles, buses and trucks) are typically over half of all vehicles. At a volume of&#13;
between 15,000 and 20,000 AADT congestion is very apparent on two-lane highways and consequently a&#13;
program of capacity expansion is underway, to provide a four lane standard on the inter-urban sections of&#13;
the route. Due to the existing and emerging congestion and vehicle mix on the highways, safety is also of&#13;
concern.&#13;
3.8    To respond to increasing transport demands, major inter-urban road improvement projects are&#13;
on-going including the proposed development of an expanded system of toll roads to be developed in the&#13;
next five to ten years. Regional transport improvements in the corridor are guided by the North Java&#13;
Transport Corridor (NJTC) Study. However the NJTC Study is concerned solely with the investment needs&#13;
in new and improved inter-urban roads to facilitate travel between Jakarta and Surabaya. It did not address&#13;
the requirements for road investment in the main urban areas. The recently approved ADB Loan 1428-INO&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 16 -                    Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
for the North Java Road Improvement Project (NJRIP) is based on the recommendations of the NJTC&#13;
Study.&#13;
3.9    Furthermore, the Heavy Loaded Road Improvement Project (HLRIP) recommends interurban&#13;
road improvements along the NJTC route and various national highways and primary roads of Java. The&#13;
construction of selected HLRIP road improvement projects is in progress with funding assistance from&#13;
the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF). This project is consistent with the plans and&#13;
recommendations of the NJTC Study and the HLRIP. It will support the achievement of the regional&#13;
transport goals of the NJTC. Individual road scheme sub-projects are designed to complement these on-&#13;
going road capacity expansion activities along the NJTC.&#13;
3.10   Toll Road Proposals.  An ambitious program  has been prepared to extend the existing&#13;
370 kilometers inter-urban toll road network in Java. Construction of about 510 kilometers of new toll&#13;
roads is proposed within the next ten years, most envisaged as build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects with&#13;
terms of normally 25 to 30 years. Proposals at various stages of development, from initial study to&#13;
concession negotiations, exist to complete a toll road along the North Java Corridor. The state toll road&#13;
corporation, PT Jasa Marga, will build and operate the 28 kilometers long Palimanan to Losari segment,&#13;
which skirts Cirebon. Implementation plans are fairly well advanced, and it is expected to open in 2002.&#13;
It is considered probable that the segment between Pemalang and Batang will be completed in 2006.&#13;
The 75 kilometers long segment between Batang and Semarang is expected to open by year 2005.&#13;
Opening of the Semarang to Demak segment is not expected until some time later, perhaps by 2007 or&#13;
2008. No information is available on the implementation schedule for toll roads in the other sections of&#13;
the corridor.&#13;
3.11   Experience of private participation in toll roads world wide and in Indonesia indicates that&#13;
effective private participation does not come about easily. GOI's outline masterplan for the strategic&#13;
network of high capacity limited access toll roads is generally sound, but is not well integrated with&#13;
parallel plans for capacity expansion on public roads. GOI Policy is that there always has to be an&#13;
alternative public route to a toll road. Along the North Java Corridor GOI has taken a view that the&#13;
alternative route should be a good quality four lane road. What needs to be done on a priority basis is to&#13;
firm up: (i) the most appropriate route alignments of the key links in the masterplan so that individual&#13;
sections can be filled in as and when justified; and (ii) the appropriate timing of construction of&#13;
individual high priority links in the light of the experience with toll road traffic growth and traffic&#13;
diversion of the past five years. Private funding over the next five years is likely to amount to&#13;
US$2 billion at the most. This would comprise: (i) urban toll road projects already committed and well&#13;
justified such as the Jakarta outer ring road and totaling some 50 km; and (ii) a program of economically&#13;
and financially viable interurban toll road projects on the order of some 200 km involving funding of&#13;
another US$1 billion.&#13;
D. NORTH JAVA TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS&#13;

urban and rural links, as shown in Table 3.2.&#13;

It should be noted that the term "rural link" may in many cases be a misnomer since a considerable&#13;
number of "rural" links are in areas which are at least semi-urban (i.e., built up on both sides of the road)&#13;
in character. For this project, traffic composition will tend to be similar to that for rural links.&#13;
3.13   The 1991 National Origin-Destination Survey. This survey provides some indication of travel&#13;
patterns for four wheeled traffic along the North Java Corridor. For the survey Central Java was divided&#13;
into 35 zones involving 29 kabupaten and six kotamadya areas. Of these, 15 zones are located along the&#13;
North Java Transport Corridor from Brebes in the west to Rembang in the east. Survey points were at&#13;
kabupaten/kotamadya boundaries. The results are shown in Table 3.3. Intra-kabupaten trip distances are&#13;
estimated to be between 40 and 90 kilometers with an average of about 50 kilometers. The average traffic&#13;
volume in the corridor of 11,000 vehicles (AADT) is at the lower end of the range estimated in the NJTC&#13;
Study as it will exclude most shorter distance trips (under 50 kms).&#13;

3.14   Traffic Growth Forecasts. Traffic growth on the national and provincial road network, and&#13;
specifically for the North Java Corridor, has been forecast by various previous studies including:&#13;
HLRIP, NJTCS, and LTDP-II. These give a range of forecasts, from 5.3%-6.2% a year to 2002, and 4%-&#13;
6.5% from 2003-2010. For this project, growth rates by vehicle type were determined, based on forecast&#13;
economic growth, as discussed in Chapter 6.&#13;
E. CURRENT AND EMERGING ISSUES&#13;
3.15   Dense development, increasing urbanization and incomes are expected to continue to increase&#13;
demands for travel throughout Java and in particular within the North Java Corridor (NJC). Road&#13;
transport's role will grow rapidly for both commercial and private transport. Attention has until now&#13;
mainly been focused on the inter-urban highways and the larger cities (within for example, IUIDP&#13;
Programs). The smaller but still significant small and medium size towns require assistance in&#13;
strengthening land use planning, provision of strategic roads and strengthening secondary road networks&#13;
(to prevent overloading of the primary networks).&#13;
3.16   Increasing congestion has been accompanied by delays and stop-start conditions at numerous&#13;
bottlenecks in the corridor which are often within or on the approaches to towns. These slow conditions&#13;
give rise to excessive levels of exhaust fumes and noise, and increased accident risk. Relief from this&#13;
congestion would be beneficial for the quality of life within towns and for the medium to long distance&#13;
commercial vehicle and other traffic.&#13;
3.17   While appropriate strategic roads including bypasses are required in many urban areas in the&#13;
North Java Corridor, they must be carefully located and implemented to ensure they are attractive to use,&#13;
have a favorable effect on the growth patterns of the towns in question and are sensitive to the urban&#13;
fabric. Quality of design and implementation is paramount to realize benefits, mitigate negative&#13;
environmental and social impacts and to manage road use and abutting land use.&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND FORMULATION&#13;
4.1    Previous Studies and Projects. A number of studies and projects funded by the Bank, ADB&#13;
and OECF have considered the development of the interurban sections of the primary road network in&#13;
Indonesia. While Indonesia has a relatively sophisticated road management system for interurban roads,&#13;
there has been no systematic nation-wide consideration of urban sections of the primary road network.&#13;
This is a shortcoming of increasing significance given the rapid urbanization in Indonesia.&#13;
4.2   In parallel, throughout Indonesia, Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Programs&#13;
(IUIDP) are being implemented and more are under preparation. IUIDPs include mainly water supply,&#13;
sanitation, waste management, drainage, and road investments within a specific local government area&#13;
(Kabupaten or Kotamadya) for a five year period. The road component generally covers construction,&#13;
improvement and rehabilitation of secondary, collector and local roads, and should in principle also&#13;
include primary roads which pass through the urban area. In practice major investments to primary&#13;
urban roads are often excluded from the IUIDPs for a variety of reasons, both of design approach (the&#13;
need to examine the relationship of individual links with the primary road network as a whole, as well as&#13;
with the local urban road network), and administrative responsibility.&#13;
4.3    The Program. The result of the current approach is that congestion on primary roads in urban&#13;
areas is not well addressed. Government of Indonesia (GOI) officials have expressed concern that&#13;
bottlenecks to economic growth are developing in urban areas, especially on Java, where the export-&#13;
oriented manufacturing industry is concentrated.  The Strategic Urban Roads Program  has been&#13;
conceived to assist GOI in addressing these concerns. This program is seen as a series of projects with&#13;
similar objectives and components, but with each project in different geographical areas and/or cities.&#13;
4.4    Strategic Assessment. A nationwide analysis of 306 cities was undertaken as part of project&#13;
preparation. In order to analyze congestion problems, and identify possible future projects, the analysis&#13;
distinguished between groups of small to medium sized cities along a road corridor and larger cities with&#13;
populations greater than 500,000. The split was due to the complexity of the problems to be analyzed,&#13;
the potential packaging of investments, and the length of time required to prepare projects. More&#13;
sophisticated analysis is required for the larger cities including integrated land use/transport studies&#13;
which must precede feasibility studies. On the other hand, it is fairly robust to have feasibility studies as&#13;
the starting point for project preparation in the corridors. Furthermore, issues such as those related to&#13;
involuntary resettlement are also more tractable in such contexts.&#13;
4.5    The project. The GOI suggested that the North Java Corridor has the most pressing congestion&#13;
problem in the country. The analysis carried out for the Strategic Assessment confirmed GOI's&#13;
assessment. This project is the first of two projects intended to address bottlenecks in small and&#13;
medium-sized towns in the North Java Corridor. Within the corridor the Bank is currently engaged in&#13;
urban projects with road components in Jakarta, Semarang and Surabaya. The ADB North Java Road&#13;
Improvement Project (ADB Loan 1428-INO) and the OECF Heavily Loaded Road Infrastructure Project&#13;
(HLRIP-OECF IP 383) are supporting improvements to the interurban primary arterial road sections.&#13;
The road sections being improved or prepared for improvement under this project will complete the&#13;
upgrading of the North Java corridor route to four lane standard between Jakarta and Surabaya.&#13;

B. OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.6    Objectives. There are five objectives for this project:&#13;
a)  to reduce traffic bottlenecks on the national roads in selected urban areas in the North Java&#13;
corridor;&#13;
b)  to address the environmental and social issues associated with the increased usage of the&#13;
national road network in these urban areas;&#13;
c)  to assist GOI in the process of decentralizing responsibility for the planning, design,&#13;
construction, maintenance, management and regulation of urban transport from central to&#13;
local government as set out in recent government regulations;&#13;
d)  to strengthen technical and institutional capabilities, particularly with respect to dealing&#13;
with environmental and social issues, of GOI's central and local government agencies&#13;
involved in urban road development and management. and&#13;
e)  to assist GOI in the formulation, articulation and implementation of urban transport policy.&#13;
4.7    Requirements. In meeting these objectives, the project should satisfy the&#13;
following requirements:&#13;
a)  to ensure that any new road provision in the selected urban areas includes measures which&#13;
facilitate the efficient, equitable and environmentally sustainable use of new road capacity&#13;
b)  to ensure that the provision of primary urban roads in the selected urban areas is fully&#13;
integrated with regional and urban spatial planning and Integrated Urban Development&#13;
Programs (IUDP) at the local government level; and&#13;
c)  to ensure the most effective and efficient utilization of the existing road network.&#13;
C. MONITORING PROJECT OUTCOMES&#13;
4.8   Indicators for monitoring the outcome of the project against the five objectives are shown in&#13;
Table 4.1 and discussed in Annex 2. Indicators for monitoring inputs (disbursements, contracts awarded,&#13;
person months of technical assistance), and outputs (physical works completed, policies and guidelines&#13;
written, persons trained) will be reported as part of normal project management. They are described in&#13;
Chapter 5. Indicators have been developed from two recent papers: "Performance Indicators for the&#13;
Road Sub-Sector: Concepts and Examples for Indonesia" given at a presentation of DGH in May 1995,&#13;
as well as from the Highway Mode Indicators in the First Edition Note "The Use of Sectoral and Project&#13;
Performance Indicators in Bank Financed Transport Operations" (Report TWU 21) April 1995.&#13;
4.9    To the extent possible, quantifiable indicators have been selected. Where this was not possible&#13;
the ratings will be based on the professional judgment of suitably qualified GOI and Bank staff&#13;
monitoring the project. Indicators have been selected which should be monitored by agencies as part of&#13;
normal operations in accordance with international good practice. Where this monitoring is not currently&#13;
being undertaken, the project will assist in establishing the data collection and analysis procedures.&#13;
Review of the indicators will be included in the joint GOI/Bank formal annual review of the project.&#13;

4.10   The outcome indicators chosen are directly related to project inputs and outputs.  These&#13;
outcomes can be influenced by the GOI and the Bank. The GOI can influence the outcome by&#13;
monitoring progress through good practice project management and taking corrective action as&#13;
appropriate. The Bank can influence the outcomes through active supervision and the annual review.&#13;
During negotiations agreement was reached on the outcome indicators and that project outcomes will&#13;
be surveyed approximately one year after the conpletion date of any sub-project&#13;
D. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.11   The project is made up of five components:&#13;
A.  Road Construction&#13;
B.  Urban Management and Quality of Life Improvements&#13;
C.  Institutional and Human Resource Development&#13;
D.  GOI Urban Road Program Development&#13;
E.  Policy Articulation and Implementation&#13;
Component A: Road Construction (US$132 million)&#13;
4.12   This component corresponds to objectives (a) and (b). It consists of seven sub-projects (road&#13;
schemes):&#13;
*   completion or new construction of ring roads or bypasses on new alignments around four&#13;
towns: Weleri, Kaliwungu, Demak and Kudus; and&#13;
*   widening and improvement to existing ring roads or bypasses around three towns: Cirebon,&#13;
Pemalang and Semarang.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 22 -                     Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
All the towns are in the Central Java Province, except Cirebon, which is in West Java. The total road&#13;
length is some 57 kms. The cost includes land acquisition (including resettlement) and construction,&#13;
remaining scheme preparation, (including final engineering design, environmental and resettlement&#13;
action plans) traffic signals, construction supervision, project management and performance monitoring.&#13;
The works include construction of culverts, bridges, road junctions, junction approach roads, and&#13;
measures to address environmental and social considerations. Subprojects are described in Annex 3.&#13;
4.13   All roads are being designed to a dual two lane carriageway standard, with an overall cross&#13;
section width of 22 meters. The roads are also being designed for limited access with widely spaced&#13;
junctions (minimum spacing 500m), with signal control or grade separation. Bridges are provided over&#13;
railways, where justified economically on operational and engineering grounds. Further details of the&#13;
road design standards are given in Annex 4. A Right of Way (ROW) width of 40 meters has been&#13;
adopted for these roads to provide adequate space at junctions, and to permit later provision of frontage&#13;
roads if required. Land is being acquired for the 40 meter ROW, with a minimum initial acquisition of a&#13;
22m ROW. The sub-projects are in different stages of design. Final Engineering Design (FED) is&#13;
complete for the Weleri sub-project, and all other FED is scheduled to be completed by December 1996.&#13;
A programmatic approach to the approval of the subprojects will be used. Selection of a sub-project in&#13;
accordance with the criteria set out in Annex 5, Bank approval of the sub-project, and where&#13;
applicable implementation of the RAP acceptable to the Bank, will be a condition of disbursement.&#13;
These criteria have been met for the Weleri sub-project, scheduled to start construction in year I of the&#13;
project.&#13;
Component B: Urban Management and Quality of Life Improvements (USS 32.3 million)&#13;
4.14   The objective of this component is to take advantage of the diversion of through traffic to&#13;
improve the quality, safety and amenity of the urban environment, and to enhance business functions.&#13;
While Components A and B are described separately, they are considered as complementary packages of&#13;
physical works. In any town, both components are necessary to meet the objectives of the project, and&#13;
achieve the economic, social and development benefits. Funding of the construction of by-passes will be&#13;
predicated on local governments agreeing to prepare and implement this component. To ensure the&#13;
existing road space is not used merely to accommodate more motorized traffic, a series of traffic,&#13;
environmental, and land use management measures will be implemented once the bypasses are open to&#13;
traffic. Local governments will be assisted to prepare and implement this component according to&#13;
agreed eligibility criteria for funding.&#13;
4.15   This component comprises these activities:&#13;
Bi A Traffic and Environmental Management Plan for the existing road and adjacent areas&#13;
to be implemented once the by-pass is opened including road scheme subprojects and other&#13;
civil works to be included in the medium term expenditure program (PJM) for the town,&#13;
with a time based implementation schedule;&#13;
B2  A Structure Plan Review. Carrying out reviews of the impact of the construction of the&#13;
bypass on the land use plan/strategic structure and transport investment plans (PJM) for&#13;
each town, together with time based proposals for any additional road scheme subprojects&#13;
required as a result of this review to be included in the traffic and environmental&#13;
management plan; and&#13;
B3 Protection of the function and the Right of Way of the bypass, through regulations, and&#13;
by making provision for development at acceptable locations along the bypass.&#13;

Strategic Structure Plans and transport investment plans has been developed. This approach will include&#13;
local participation of business and civic groups, is also shown in Annex 6. Selection of a road scheme&#13;
sub-project in accordance with the criteria set out in Annex 6, Bank approval of the sub-project, and&#13;
where applicable implementation of the RAP acceptable to the Bank, will be a condition of&#13;
disbursement.&#13;
Component C: Institutional and Human Resource Development TA (US$ 2.2 million)&#13;
4.17   This component will assist in the decentralization of responsibilities for urban transport&#13;
(including roads, traffic management and public transport) from central to local government, as set out in&#13;
Law 14 of 1992 and the subsequent enabling regulations, and the strengthening of BINKOT to deal with&#13;
environmental and social issues. The component consists of activities directly linked to construction and&#13;
operation of the SURIP bypasses, as set out below.&#13;
4.18   Cl Strengthening  of DLLAJ in  participating  local governments. Based on their&#13;
responsibilities under GOT regulations DLLAJ in the participating local governments covering project&#13;
towns should take the lead in preparing and implementing the "Quality of Life" improvements, which&#13;
should be put in place once the bypasses are open to traffic. For this reason, and to benefit from the&#13;
lessons learned from RCUTP, the initiation by the participating local government of the process for the&#13;
establishment of DLLAJ is a condition of sub-project approval as indicated in Annex 5. As the DLLAJ&#13;
are new organizations, they will need TA support in their initial period of operation. The project will&#13;
provide support for the institutional strengthening of the newly established DLLAJ and training of local&#13;
govemment staff in the DLLAJ to fulfill their new roles using training material already prepared under&#13;
previous Bank funded projects. The TA will include preparation of draft guidelines for traffic and&#13;
environment area management.&#13;
4.19   C2 Strengthening of BINKOT AMDAL Section. This activity will provide further operational&#13;
support to BINKOT AMDAL Section. The TOR for this further support will be similar to the TOR for&#13;
the TA funded under HSL 2, a copy of which is on the project file. The support will be scheduled so that&#13;
the BINKOT AMDAL Section can take the lead role in the environmental management and monitoring&#13;
of the road scheme sub-projects. This TA will also support updating of BINKOT technical guidelines on&#13;
the environmental and resettlement aspects of urban roads.&#13;
Component D: Urban Road Program Development (US$ 0.6 million)&#13;
4.21   This component is intended to provide on initial step in improving the road planning system for&#13;
urban areas. Technical assistance support will be provided to BINKOT for the creation and updating of a&#13;
database to support the urban road investment program, as part of the overall Urban Road Management&#13;
System (URMS) which is being implemented progressively on a modular basis with support from the&#13;
Bank and ADB. The database will be established at a national level, but designed to be capable of&#13;
application also at a provincial or local government level. Support under this project will assist BINKOT&#13;
to complete the establishment of a road network data base for 306 cities, to analyze the data and to&#13;
update previous analysis from SURIP project preparation and the Road Sector Study.&#13;

Component E: Policy Formulation and Articulation (US$ 0.6 million)&#13;
4.23   This component will provide Technical Assistance (TA) to GOI in the articulation and&#13;
implementation of urban transport policy. There are two activities, Urban Transport Policy and&#13;
Programs, and Planning, Programming, and Execution of Urban Road Works.&#13;
4.24   El Urban Transport Policy and Programs. Under this sub-component, support is to be&#13;
provided to the Interministerial Working Group (established formally in December 1995 by&#13;
BAPPENAS) to prepare by mid 1997 an urban transport policy for incorporation in the Transport Section&#13;
part of REPELITA VII. A Japanese PHRD grant fund of $1.34 M equivalent has been obtained to assist&#13;
GOI to formulate a national urban transport policy framework, and within this framework to develop&#13;
urban transport policies and investment programs for case study cities.&#13;
4.25   E2 Planning, Programming and Execution of Urban Road Works. This activity will provide&#13;
consultant services to support BINKOT in the preparation/updating of existing policies, procedures and&#13;
guidelines, on the planning, design and management of urban roads for application at the national and&#13;
local level, including for IUDP. This activity will complement the institutional development activity in&#13;
BINKOT and will be undertaken in parallel with the preparation of other potential SURIP projects. It&#13;
will also extend similar policy development activities for interurban roads being undertaken as part of the&#13;
Bank funded Second Highway Sector Loan. Initial technical areas to be addressed will include&#13;
feasibility studies, functional design guidelines, economic evaluation, , and IUDP. Further details are&#13;
provided in Annex 7.&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
4.26  Impacts. The proposed project has been classified as environmental category A under the&#13;
Bank's procedures as significant impacts are expected to occur. The construction of new roads in or&#13;
adjacent to existing urban areas impacts on the environment, particularly in terms of noise, air pollution,&#13;
road safety and community severance. Air and noise pollution are to be expected to accompany the&#13;
construction of the road schemes. However the by-passes will relieve the existing roads through the&#13;
center of the towns of the through-traffic of trucks and buses. This will reduce levels of noise and air&#13;
pollution in town centers and enhance their role as a focus for social interaction.&#13;
4.27   Environmental Procedures. The legal basis for environmental protection and management in&#13;
Indonesia was substantially modified by Government Regulation No. 51 of 1993 (PP 51/1993). This&#13;
recent legislative change has served to extend the AMDAL system to an activity which is "required as&#13;
part of the decision-making process". While overall coordination of the AMDAL system rests with the&#13;
Environmental Impact Management Agency (BAPEDAL), central and provincial level government&#13;
agencies are directly responsible for implementing these procedures.&#13;
4.28   Bina Marga has recently finalized an AMDAL screening process for road projects, shown in&#13;
Annex &amp; This process is being applied to road schemes in this project. This screening process provides&#13;
a systematic approach to environmental impact assessment, monitoring and management, based on a&#13;
project's type, scale and location in relation to a range of sensitive environmental areas. For all projects&#13;
that may result in significant environmental impacts and/or involve sensitive environmental areas, the&#13;
preparation of an ANDAL study (a detailed environmental impact assessment) is required and will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank as part of the sub-project approval process. Such ANDAL studies substantially&#13;
comply with World Bank requirements for project-specific environmental assessments.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 25 -                      Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
4.29   Sub-Projects. An overriding objective of BINKOT and the Bank in reviewing the alignment&#13;
and detailed design of the urban road sub-projects proposed for the project has been to avoid resettlement&#13;
as far as possible and to minimize the adverse impact on the environment. The Environmental&#13;
Assessment (EA) has been completed, and a summary EA prepared for the five schemes being&#13;
considered for construction starts in years I and 2 of the project. These are Stage I of the Cirebon and&#13;
Pemalang by-passes, Weleri, and Kaliwungu bypasses and Semarang Northern bypass Stage 1. This&#13;
summary in Bahasa Indonesia has been made available for public inspection in the affected localities.&#13;
Weleri and Kaliwungu by-passes are on green field alignments, but in both cases there is a Kampung&#13;
(village) close to the road which will suffer significant increases in noise and pollution levels. Noise&#13;
barriers or mitigation measures are required for compliance with draft Indonesian standards.&#13;
Environmental Management and Monitoring Plans have been prepared.&#13;
4.30   EAs for sub-projects to be constructed in later years are in progress, and are part of the process&#13;
for completion of road scheme sub-project design which has been agreed with GOI. Critical issues&#13;
which will be included in these documents are included in Annex 8. The need for full ANDAL (EIA)&#13;
studies has been agreed for the flyovers being evaluated for the railway crossings on the Cirebon by-pass&#13;
(stage 2) and the Kalibanteng roundabout at the western end of Semarang Northern Ring Road. For road&#13;
schemes sub-projects, completion of satisfactory EA, management and monitoring plans is one of the&#13;
criteria that have to be met before the sub-project is approved as indicated in Annex 5.&#13;
F. LAND ACQuISITION, RESETTLEMENT AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
4.31   Presidential Decree 55 (KEPRES 55, 1993), on land acquisition for public facilities, seeks to&#13;
ensure adequate access to information, fair negotiations, compensation awards based on real values, and&#13;
rights of appeal to the courts. KEPRES 55 still has gaps primarily in the areas of entitlement eligibility&#13;
and funding sources, and time will be required to develop implementation capacities based on local&#13;
experiences. Land acquisition and resettlement are required for the road schemes. Every effort has been&#13;
made in designing the road sub-projects to minimize resettlement. Some land acquisition took place&#13;
prior to KEPRES 55/1993, using national funds (APBD), and before Bank identification of the project.&#13;
Some resettlement has taken place within the framework of KEPRES 55. Further resettlement will be&#13;
based on policy guidelines which resolve the differences between KEPRES 55 and OD 4.30. A single&#13;
local government decree Surat Keputusan (SK) Walikota/Bupati has been issued by the local&#13;
walikotas/bupatis. To clarify the policy and procedures described in the decree, further explanation is&#13;
required, to be provided by a Juklak (Implementation Guidelines) to be issued by each walikota/bupati.&#13;
A draft model Juklak was agreed at negotiations. Together the Surat Keputusan and Juklak will provide&#13;
the policy and procedures framework and describe a Resettlement Action Plan that will be furnished to&#13;
the Bank as part of the process for approval of sub-projects. Approval and issuance by each&#13;
walikota/bupati of the Juklaks, taking into account the agreements reached at negotiations, will be a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
4.32   Some 63 hectares have been acquired and a further 58 hectares of land are to be acquired for the&#13;
by pass sub-projects. Land acquisition requirements are being refined as final engineering designs are&#13;
completed. Some 1800 families are affected by the by passes at Cirebon, Pemalang, Weleri, Kaliwungu&#13;
and Kudus. Only 52 families of the 1800 families affected require resettlement for the bypass sub-&#13;
projects at Weleri, Kaliwungu and Kudus.  Requirements for other sub-projects are still being&#13;
determined. Detailed resettlement action plans for sub-projects will be prepared and submitted to the&#13;
Bank for review as part of the programmatic approval process for sub projects agreed with GOI. To&#13;
minimize resettlement needs at Pemalang, a new alignment is being investigated for the western section&#13;
of the bypass. At Weleri, the bypass runs through the edge of a Kampung (as noted above). The road is&#13;
&#13;

to be constructed on an embankment to maintain a local road connection between the two parts of the&#13;
Kampung, mitigating the severance.&#13;
G. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
4.33   For the road construction component (Component A), costs are generally based on FED and&#13;
include a 5% physical contingency. For some short sections, costs are based on preliminary designs and&#13;
include a 10% physical contingency, which will be reduced to 5% when FED is completed.&#13;
4.34   The direct and indirect foreign exchange component has been estimated based on recent Bank&#13;
projects of a similar nature. Price contingencies have been estimated based on rates of inflation of 2.3%&#13;
foreign and 6.0% local. For the Quality of Life Component (Component B), costs are based on&#13;
preliminary estimates of the resources required to undertake work of a similar nature in other towns as&#13;
part of the Bank-funded IUIDPs, and include a 15% contingency. The resulting costs are shown in&#13;
Table 4.2. Further details are provided in Annex 9.&#13;
H. FINANCING&#13;
4.35   The proposed Bank loan of US$86.9 million would finance about 52% of total project cost,&#13;
representing 100% of foreign cost and 35% of local cost. GOI would finance the remaining US$80.7&#13;
million equivalent, or about 48% of the total estimated project cost, through annual budgetary&#13;
allocations from the central government budget APBN. The financing of the proposed project is shown&#13;
in Table 4.3.&#13;

5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES&#13;
5.1    Project. The project falls within the general responsibilities of BAPPENAS, Deputy Chairman&#13;
for Infrastructure Development.. Within the Transportation Bureau, the IWG for urban transportation&#13;
will oversee the planning and implementation of urban transportation programs.  It will be the&#13;
responsibility of the IWG to steer and monitor the progress of the project, to ensure that it meets national&#13;
goals and objectives and to facilitate coordination among the different ministries and across departments.&#13;
The Directorate General of Highways (DGH) of the Ministry of Public Works is the Executing agency.&#13;
The Directorate of Urban Road Development (BINKOT) of DGH is the lead implementing agency for&#13;
the project. Implementation is to be managed through a Project Management Unit (PMU) to be&#13;
established within BINKOT and described in Section C.&#13;
5.2    Components. Existing agencies at the central and local government levels will be responsible&#13;
for the day to day implementation of individual sub-components, as follows:&#13;
A. Road Construction. All sub-projects will be implemented directly by BINKOT. Land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement for schemes is the responsibility of the individual participating&#13;
governments.&#13;
B.  Urban Management and Quality of Life. This component and sub-projects will be&#13;
implemented by the participating local governments through BAPPEDA Tkll, except for&#13;
sub components on primary urban roads, which will be implemented by BINKOT.&#13;
Planning and design of the traffic and environmental management measures will be&#13;
undertaken by the DLLAJ, and implementation by the local government Public Works&#13;
Department (DPUK).&#13;
C.  Institutional and Human Resource Development. Overall responsibility for the sub-&#13;
component Cl program of strengthening the DLLAJ in the project towns will be the&#13;
responsibility of DGLT (MOC) assisted by DG PUOD (MHA). In individual local&#13;
governments responsibility will fall on the BAPPEDA  TkII.   Responsibility for&#13;
strengthening BINKOT AMDAL section rests with BINKOT.&#13;
D.  Urban Road Program. This component will be implemented by BINKOT.&#13;
E.  Policy Development. Sub-component El - Urban Transport Policy and Programs will be&#13;
implemented by the BAPPENAS Urban Transport IWG. The lead agency for sub-&#13;
component E2 Planning, Programming and Execution of Urban Road Works will be&#13;
BINKOT.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM&#13;
5.3    The Project Implementation Memorandum  (PIM) will document the respective roles,&#13;
responsibilities and procedures for project implementation, in the form of a memorandum of&#13;
understanding between DGH, DGLT and the participating local governments. Annex 10 displays a draft&#13;
model PIM, agreed during negotiations. Signature of thefinal PIM will be a condition of effectiveness.&#13;

5.4    The Project Implementation Plan (PIP) is a technical working document for use by the PMU in&#13;
the project management of the implementation of all components of the project during the period of the&#13;
loan. The PIP will include the implementation schedule, procurement plan, disbursement schedule,&#13;
performance indicators and monitoring for the overall project and for individual sub-projects and&#13;
activities. A draft PIP is in the project file. The PIP will also indicate all implementation activities to be&#13;
undertaken in any GOI fiscal year. This information will provide the framework for the preparation by&#13;
the implementing agencies of annual work programs.&#13;
5.5    Annual Work Programs. Based on the provisions of the PIM, and the technical framework in&#13;
the PIP, Annual Work Programs (AWP) will be drawn up by BINKOT, DGLT and the participating local&#13;
governments. Through the AWPs, these implementing agencies would commit themselves to undertake&#13;
in a given year specific sub-projects and activities of the project, and to achieve specific targets. The&#13;
draft AWPs will be prepared by July 31 of each year, for presentation to the GOI/Bank Annual Review&#13;
Meetings in October, and finalization by the following April 15. It will be the responsibility of the PMU&#13;
to assemble the AWP's into a single document for presentation to the Annual Review Meetings, and to&#13;
update the PIP to reflect the finalized AWPs.&#13;
5.6    An outline of the AWP agreed at negotiations is presented in Annex 11. BINKOT is the only&#13;
executing agency with any expenditure scheduled for year 1, (GOI FY 96/97). Assurances were given&#13;
by GOI at negotiations that (a) the A WP for year 1 will be adopted by BINKOT not later than&#13;
November 1, 1996 and (b) commencing on April 5, 1997 and thereafter by April 15 in each year until&#13;
completion of the project, A WP will be adopted by BINKOT, DGLT and each of the participating local&#13;
governments. Executed A WP documents for each participating local government for year 2 of the&#13;
project (GOI FY 97/98) will be a condition of disbursement.&#13;
5.7    Annual Review Meeting. The annual review of the project will provide the opportunity to&#13;
review the progress of the implementation of the project, and to institute actions to mitigate&#13;
unsatisfactory performance. The review will take place by October 31 of each year, to coordinate with&#13;
the GOI Budget process, and to ensure appropriate provision is made for counterpart funds in GOI&#13;
budgets. The review will focus on the following:&#13;
a)  the evaluation of progress for the preceding fiscal year;&#13;
b)  the draft AWPs proposed for the following fiscal year; and&#13;
c)  performance monitoring targets.&#13;
The proposed arrangement for annual reviews by October 31 of each year were confirmed by GOI at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
C. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.8    The PMU in BINKOT will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the project, and&#13;

5.9    The PMU will be supported by a consultant. The TOR and shortlist for these consultant services&#13;
are on the project file. Establishment of the PMU will be a condition of disbursement. At negotiations&#13;
it was agreed that the PMU will be established about one month after the signing of the Loan&#13;
Agreement, and that the consultants to assist the PMU will be mobilized about one month after loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
D. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
5.10   The project will be implemented over five years, starting in GOI FY 96/97 (year 1), and be&#13;
completed in GOI FY 2001/02 as shown in Annex 9. A project launch workshop will be scheduled close&#13;
to loan effectiveness. The program of civil works is scheduled to commence procurement after&#13;
negotiations, with contracts scheduled to be awarded once the loan is effective. For road schemes&#13;
subprojects scheduled to start construction in year 1, the criteria for approval listed in Annex 5 have been&#13;
met, and contract documents have been submitted to the Bank for review. Design for later year schemes&#13;
is largely complete, with all design scheduled to be completed by mid December 1996. Designs for&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 32 -                     Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
Component B 1 will be finalized during the construction of the bypasses, with construction starting soon&#13;
after the bypasses are open to traffic.&#13;
5.11   Outline TOR for all consulting services and TA have been prepared. Shortlists of consultants for&#13;
consulting services are being drawn up. The remainder of the request for proposals package for&#13;
consulting services will use standard documents.&#13;
E. PROCUREMENT&#13;
5.12   Procurement of works and goods will follow the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 and revised in January 1996. Large civil works contracts costing&#13;
US$3 million equivalent or more and goods contracts costing US$250,000 equivalent or more would be&#13;
procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, using the Bank's standard&#13;
bidding documents (SBD). A general procurement notice would be issued in advance to encourage&#13;
participation of eligible parties. Domestic preference would be provided during bid evaluation at a rate&#13;
of 15 percent of the CIF price or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower for local manufacturers&#13;
participating in the ICB procurement of goods. Smaller civil works contracts, valued at less than US&#13;
$3 million equivalent up to an aggregate amount of US$25.8 million, and goods estimated to cost less&#13;
than $250,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $550,000, may be procured under&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. All consultant services under&#13;
the Bank loan would be procured by the responsible agency for each contract in accordance with the&#13;
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency" dated August 1981. The Bank's standard form of contract for Consultant's Services, dated&#13;
June 1995 will be used.&#13;
5.13   Prequalification.  Invitations for prequalification or bids concerning large, specialized, or&#13;
important contracts (that is contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$10 million or more) would&#13;
be advertised as Specific Procurement Notices (SPN) in the U.N. Development Business and/or well-&#13;
known technical magazines, newspapers, and trade publications of wide international circulation.&#13;
Contractors for civil works of US$3 million equivalent or more in value would be pre-qualified in&#13;
accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank.   The Bank's standard documents for&#13;
prequalification will be used.&#13;
5.14   Procurement Review. The following will be subject to prior review by the Bank: civil works&#13;
contracts of US$3 million equivalent or more in value; goods contracts of US$250,000 equivalent or&#13;
more in value; and consultant contracts with an estimated value of US$100,000 or more for engagement&#13;
of firms and US$50,000 or more for the hiring of individuals. The first contract for civil works and&#13;
goods for each implementing agency would also be subject to prior review by the Bank, to assure use of&#13;
standard procedures and contract forms. The balance of contracts, including those reimbursed under&#13;
statements of expenditure, would be subject to selective post-review by the Bank. TORs for all&#13;
consulting services, including engineering design and construction supervision, studies, other technical&#13;
assistance, and all single source selections would also be subject to prior review by the Bank. Prior&#13;
review by the Bank is expected to cover approximately 80% of the total value of civil works contracts&#13;
financed by the project, and approximately 80% of the total value of goods contracts financed by the&#13;
project.&#13;
5.15   Procurement Design. Where technically feasible and administratively practical, sub-projects&#13;
have been packaged together for tendering. Procurement of physical components has been kept separate&#13;
for each agency, and for each level of government to avoid administrative delays and complex payment&#13;
&#13;

US$50,000 equivalent. All other disbursements, including first contracts by implementing agencies,&#13;
would be made against statements of expenditure for which relevant documents would be retained by the&#13;
MOF Directorate General for Budget Administration (DG TUJA) and the implementing agencies and&#13;
made available to the Bank for review upon request.&#13;
G. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.19   Project Accounts and Audits.  The BINKOT PMU will have overall responsibility for&#13;
establishing, maintaining and monitoring a uniform project accounting system. The PMU will also&#13;
prepare project accounts of all components implemented directly by the central agencies. Project&#13;
accounts for sub-components implemented by local governments will be the responsibility of the&#13;
structural financial agency within the local government secretariat. The BINKOT PMU will also be&#13;
responsible for consolidating quarterly project accounts and submitting them annually for consolidated&#13;
audit purposes by the BPKP Central Office. The PMU will also coordinate statements of expenditure&#13;
audits with the Directorate General for the Budget, Bank Indonesia and the State Audit Board's Central&#13;
Office. At negotiations, assurances were given by GOI that:&#13;
a)  the implementing agencies would keep separate accountsfor the proposedproject;&#13;
b) the project accounts, including documentation for statement of expenditures will be&#13;
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; and&#13;
c)  the consolidated audit reports will be submitted to the Bank within six months after the&#13;
end of each fiscal year.&#13;
H. PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
5.20   The PMU will be responsible for monitoring project inputs, outputs and other indicators. Project&#13;
inputs include contracts awarded, contract commitments, disbursements, and person months of&#13;
consultant services. Project outputs are discussed below. Other monitoring indicators include noise and&#13;
air pollution (part of environmental monitoring), road accidents (part of social monitoring), and traffic&#13;
speeds. These indicators will be monitored to provide data on conditions before and after construction of&#13;
the road scheme sub projects. The PMU will be responsible for ensuring that this "before and after"&#13;
monitoring is undertaken. To assist in project monitoring the PMU will implement a management&#13;
information system that will monitor amongst other things; physical and financial progress in project&#13;
implementation, contract commitments, disbursements, environmental management and resettlement&#13;
action plans.&#13;
5.21   Project Outputs. Table 5.4 shows outputs for each project component, and the target indicators&#13;
for satisfactory implementation. The satisfactory achievement targets for year I are contained in the&#13;
draft AWP for year I agreed at negotiations. Annual targets towards the achievement of these outputs for&#13;
the second and subsequent years of the project will be agreed during the Annual Reviews. The PMIU will&#13;
be responsible for monitoring and reporting on progress towards these output targets. The level of&#13;
achievement of the outputs and any corrective actions required as a result of unsatisfactory achievement&#13;
will be one of the items for the Annual Review.&#13;
&#13;

5.22   Environmental Monitoring. The environmental management and monitoring procedures for&#13;
this project draw on the experience gained by Bina Marga and the Bank in the implementation of HSL2.&#13;
Environmental Protection Measures during construction will be included in the civil works contract&#13;
documents, and bonded. The TOR for the consultant to support the PMU includes a requirement for&#13;
foreign and local environmental officers to supervise implementation of environmental and social&#13;
mitigation measures.&#13;
5.23   As part of the environmental and social monitoring of sub-projects provided for within the&#13;
AMDAL procedures, it will be necessary to determine noise, air quality and socio-economic impacts at&#13;
selected sites. Data would be collected on actual levels as well as on community perception. As traffic&#13;
volumes will be the most significant component of noise generation, traffic data will also be collected as&#13;
part of the one monitoring program. It is envisaged that a local consultant will carry out the program&#13;
with support from the environmental officer in the PMU. The AMDAL section in BINKOT is&#13;
developing its own capability to carry out and manage project monitoring according to recommendations&#13;
in UPL and/or RKL reports. The TA being provided for institutional strengthening of BINKOT AMDAL&#13;
section will support this capacity building.&#13;
5.24   Social Monitoring. As part of the social monitoring of sub-projects provided for within the&#13;
AMDAL procedures, it will be necessary to determine socio-economic impacts of selected sites. Data&#13;
will be collected on actual impacts as well as on community perception. In particular, the socio-&#13;
economic conditions of project-affected persons who are resettled will be surveyed one year after&#13;
resettlement, while all affected persons will be surveyed one year after the completion of the sub-project&#13;
affecting them. Road accidents will be monitored, using data collected as part of the normal operating&#13;
procedures of the traffic police.&#13;
1. REPORTING&#13;
5.25   The PMU will be responsible for preparing monthly, quarterly and annual progress reports&#13;
covering all SURIP components. The PMU will consolidate govemment agency and consultant monthly&#13;
reports into an overall monthly progress report for submission to BINKOT management. These monthly&#13;
reports will form the basis for monitoring progress of the project.&#13;
5.26   Quarterly Reports. These will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by the PMU on the basis&#13;
of inputs from the various central, Kabupaten and Kotamadya implementing agencies. The quarterly&#13;
reports will include summaries of progress of each project for submission to DGH, MPW, BAPPENAS,&#13;
MOF, and the Bank. The reports will include an overall summary and cover progress on:&#13;
a)  physical progress of each component;&#13;
b)  financial progress of each component, including project costs, contract commitments, and&#13;
forecast disbursement schedule;&#13;
c)  consulting services, including reports produced, and details of Steering Group and&#13;
Technical Committee meetings;&#13;
d)  compliance with loan covenants; and&#13;
e)  a list of action to be taken by the various parties.&#13;
Quarterly reports will be submitted within 30 days from the end of each quarter, starting with the quarter&#13;
ending in September 1996.&#13;

5.27   Annual Reports. These reports will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by the PMU, on the&#13;
basis of reports prepared by the implementing agencies, no later than July 31 of each year. They will&#13;
contain similar data to the data contained in the quarterly reports, and will include an evaluation of&#13;
progress relative to the agreed Performance Indicator targets. The annual reports will provide the basis&#13;
for the annual reviews of project implementation. Assurances were given by GOI at negotiations that&#13;
the Inspectorate General of MPPW and the relevant kabupaten or kotamadya inspectorates will carry&#13;
out annual technical audits during project implementation by October 31 of each year.&#13;
5.28   Implementation Completion Report. On completion of the project and within six months of&#13;
the Loan closing date, BINKOT, together with the participating Kabupatens and Kotamadyas, will&#13;
prepare an Implementation Completion Report for review by GOI and the Bank.&#13;
J. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
5.29   The new road scheme sub-projects will be designated as national roads and DGH will be&#13;
responsible for maintenance. The Road Sector study found that overall the level of funding for&#13;
maintenance of national roads was adequate. The existing national roads passing through towns, will be&#13;
handed over to Kotamadya/Kabupaten once the bypasses are opened to traffic. DGH will be relieved of&#13;
the responsibility of maintaining these roads. As a result there will be a minor increase in the lane&#13;
length of road that DGH has to maintain, the maintenance of which can be absorbed by DGH through&#13;
ongoing efficiency measures.&#13;
5.30    The traffic management plans prepared under component BI of the project are designed to&#13;
ensure that the most effective use and efficient operation of the road networks in the project towns once&#13;
the by-passes are opened to traffic. The extra road length will represent a very small percentage of the&#13;
road length in the Kotamadya. Based on findings of the Road Sector study, the local governments should&#13;
be able to find the resources to maintain these roads through efficiency gains in their overall road&#13;
maintenance programs. It will be necessary to ensure that the local governments have sufficient&#13;
resources to maintain the extra road length. Routine road maintenance equipment and training for&#13;
equipment operators is to be provided under the project to assist the local government in this task.&#13;
BINKOT will assess the technical and financial capabilities of project cities for maintaining additional&#13;
roads. Depending on the results of this assessment, BINKOT will initiate a dialogue with the Ministry of&#13;
Home Affairs regarding an increase in the INPRES grant reflecting the increase in road network assets.&#13;
K. BANK SUPERVISION&#13;
5.31   The project will require about 20 to 25 staff weeks of Bank supervision during the first and&#13;
second years of the project, and 15-20 staff weeks for the following years. Details are shown in&#13;
Annex 14. These estimates assume that supervision missions for the proposed project will be combined&#13;
with missions for preparation of possible future SURIPs in Bank FY97 and 98 and missions for&#13;
supervision of these projects in later years. Three missions a year are planned in FY97 and 98 as&#13;
analysis by OED suggests that extra supervision during this period assists in achieving satisfactory&#13;
project outcomes, with two missions a year thereafter. Typically one mission in October would conduct&#13;
the Annual Review, while a mission in April would review the final AWPs. The annual review mission&#13;
is scheduled to coordinate with GOI budget process to ensure appropriate provision is made for&#13;
counterpart funds in GOI budgets. Supervision missions will include engineering, transport planning,&#13;
environmental and resettlement expertise. Other skills would be added as required, particularly for the&#13;
annual review. Between missions, supervision activity will include pre-construction screening of later&#13;
year sub-projects, review of procurement documents and procedures and physical progress on site, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. POLICY CONTEXT&#13;
6.1    Overall, the project is expected to contribute towards the further development of an&#13;
environmentally sustainable transport policy in a country facing increased motorization, and to the&#13;
further transfer of responsibility for the implementation of such policy to local government. Benefits&#13;
will flow to producers and consumers through reduced transport costs. Residents of the towns being by-&#13;
passed will benefit from a safer and more pleasant urban environment. The overall level of road safety&#13;
should be improved.&#13;
6.2    Linkage to Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and Sector Work.  From  a national&#13;
perspective, the overall project assists in the implementation of GOI urban and transport sector policy,&#13;
with the different components supporting implementation of specific policy initiatives as well as the GOI&#13;
policy on decentralization. The project also supports the CAS by assisting in the reduction of transport&#13;
costs (and hence enhancing competitiveness), and by taking steps to improve environmental management&#13;
and decentralized public sector management.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
6.3    The assessment carried out during the preparation of this project found that the project corridor&#13;
has the most pressing congestion problems among the national urban road sections. A number of&#13;
regional studies have forecast a continuing growth in traffic in the corridor, with little change in road&#13;
share. The road schemes proposed are consistent with the plans and recommendations of the NJTC&#13;
Study, and the HLRIP. They will complement the interurban road capacity expansion in the NJTC&#13;
funded under the recently approved ADB Loan No. 1428 -INO. Justification by component is discussed&#13;
below.&#13;
6.4    Analysis of Alternatives. Potential options to address the identified congestion problems are:&#13;
(a)    widening the existing roads, and&#13;
(b)    building a new road on a new alignment.&#13;
Within option (b), alternatives were considered for design and construction standards, staging of&#13;
construction, and financing as a public or toll road. The road scheme sub- component designs adopted&#13;
represent the least cost options over a 20-year period on the basis of engineering and economic&#13;
judgment. The costs include construction, land acquisition, resettlement, environmental mitigation&#13;
measures and annual maintenance costs.&#13;
6.5    Except in Cirebon, Pemalang and Semarang, the option of widening the existing road was not&#13;
considered feasible due to the extent of resettlement of residents and demolition of commercial property&#13;
and resultant high land acquisition costs. The alignments for the new roads at Weleri, Kaliwungu and&#13;
Kudus were selected and partially constructed by the local government prior to Bank identification of&#13;
this project.  These alignments were reviewed during site visits and considered to be generally&#13;
acceptable. A number of changes have been incorporated at the request of the Bank to reduce&#13;
environmental impacts and to improve the network operating efficiency. Alternative alignments were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 40 -                        Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
investigated at Pemalang for part and at Demak for all of the bypass, to reduce environmental impacts,&#13;
construction and land acquisition costs.&#13;
6.6    The highway design standards are a function of the volume and vehicle mix of traffic expected to&#13;
use the road links over the initial ten-year road pavement design life, and chosen so as to minimize&#13;
construction and maintenance costs. The 40 meter ROW width has been selected based on a 20 year&#13;
initial design life for the road, to protect the road investment for at least this period The option of a&#13;
narrower (22 meter) ROW was considered but rejected as likely to result in the road gradually taking on&#13;
a local access road function so that in five to ten years another by-pass would be required. Options for at&#13;
grade or grade separated crossings of railways and local roads, and staged construction have been&#13;
evaluated to arrive at the preferred design and staging of the individual road schemes. Analysis of staged&#13;
construction involved evaluation of the NPV for the initial construction of a two or four lane main road,&#13;
and consideration of timing of construction of frontage access roads within the 40 meter ROW.&#13;
6.7    Potential for Private Sector Participation/Toll Roads. Current toll road proposals relevant to&#13;
the road schemes in this proposed project are described in Chapter 4. Tolling the project roads would&#13;
leave the existing congested link for traffic unwilling to pay the toll. Only at Demak and Kudus could&#13;
the alignments proposed be considered for inclusion in the Semarang - Kudus toll road. The private&#13;
sector would require the financial viability to be firmly established, which is not the case for the&#13;
proposed project roads. Analysis indicates that the financial rate of return for individual sub-projects&#13;
under this project will be below the 25% sought by many institutional investors for a road project.&#13;
6.8    The approach adopted in this project (and for ADB Loan 1428-INO) was therefore to accept that&#13;
the "free" public road improvement would precede the parallel toll road and to assess the potential&#13;
diversion of traffic to the toll road at various opening dates for the toll road. For economic analysis of&#13;
the road schemes the opening dates assumed (and GOI targets) are Cirebon 2002 (1998), Pemalang 2006&#13;
(2002), Weleri and Kaliwungu 2005 (2003), Demak and Kudus 2007 (2003). There is some risk that&#13;
construction of the sub-project will delay investment in toll roads, since the GOI does not (and should&#13;
not) give a "traffic guarantee" to investors. However, GOI has already committed itself to investments in&#13;
the interurban sections of the public road in the corridor which are likely have a greater impact on&#13;
investor interest.&#13;
6.9    Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery. The Road Sector Study discusses the future fiscal impact of&#13;
road programs at a national level. At a local level the transfer of the existing national road to local&#13;
government following opening of the bypass will increase local maintenance expenditures. The impact&#13;
is not considered to be significant, but is to be reviewed by BINKOT so that the central government&#13;
budget transfers can be adjusted if necessary (see Section 5.30).&#13;
6.10   Beneficiaries. Direct beneficiaries of the road schemes will be two groups. First, the road users&#13;
who will benefit from lowered Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) and travel times. Second, the residents&#13;
of the newly by-passed towns of Pemalang, Weleri, Kaliwungu,, Demak and Kudus will benefit from the&#13;
reduction in through traffic. The quantifiable economic benefits to road users have been calculated using&#13;
a standard methodology. Existing traffic likely to use the by-passes has been estimated from Origin and&#13;
Destination surveys of existing traffic entering and leaving the towns. Future traffic levels have been&#13;
estimated by applying growth factors to these traffic levels of 6.5% a year from 1995 to 2003, and 5.5%&#13;
thereafter. The growth factors are within the bounds of traffic projections in four previous studies in the&#13;
corridor, as discussed in Chapter 3. The analysis included sensitivity tests on these traffic projections.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infiastructure Project  - 41 -                    StaffAppraisal Report&#13;
6.11   Benefits. Benefits are a function of changes in VOC and in journey times for vehicle occupants&#13;
making business trips (trips in the course of their work). 25% of trips by vehicle occupants are assumed&#13;
to be for business, and to have an economic value of Rp 1020/hour per bus passenger and Rp 6000/hour&#13;
per car occupant. Travel time savings for other trips are not included. Travel times have been&#13;
determined by applying speed/flow curves from the Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual to the forecast&#13;
traffic flows. Based on these flows, average speeds are expected to increase from 32 km/h to 54 - 60&#13;
km/h in the year of opening. VOC have been derived using the VOC module (VOCM-4) of the Bank's&#13;
Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM III). Basic road user cost data have been obtained from&#13;
the IRMS VOC Parameter File, and updated to September 1995. Based on international experience, it is&#13;
expected that there will be a reduction in fatalities, and a reduction in accident rates (fatalities/vehicle&#13;
km) from the new road construction.&#13;
6.12   Economic Rates of Return (ERR) and Net Present Value. The ERR for individual road&#13;
scheme sub-projects are shown in Table 6.1. All road sub-projects have a positive net present value&#13;
(NPV) with a discount rate of 15% with the value of time savings only for business trips included in the&#13;
benefit stream. When all such time savings are excluded from the benefits, the NPV is positive with the&#13;
lower discount rate of 10%, except for the Kaliwungu and Demak projects. The estimated accident&#13;
reduction benefits for the sub-projects at Cirebon, Pemalang, Semarang and Weleri are between 7% and&#13;
25% of VOC benefits, at Demak 62% and at Kudus 75%. As the Kaliwungu bypass is longer than the&#13;
existing road, the overall accident benefits are estimated to be much higher than the VOC benefits.&#13;

6.13   Sensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity tests were undertaken to test the robustness of the results&#13;
against changes in key input parameters: average speeds, traffic growth rates, diversion to toll roads, and&#13;
the percentage of trips with economic value. The ERR's remain above 15% even if about half the&#13;
envisaged gain in vehicle speeds fails to materialize i.e. average speeds on all road sub-project schemes&#13;
could be reduced by 10 km (to 44-50 km/h). The Demak bypass is most sensitive to traffic volumes, a&#13;
reduction in traffic volumes in traffic growth rates to 5.5% a year from 1995 to 2003, and 4.5% thereafter&#13;
would reduce the ERR to around 15%. In the case of the Cirebon bypass, with these lower traffic growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 42 -                      Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
rates and a 60% diversion of bypass traffic to the proposed toll road, (in place of the 40% assumed for&#13;
the main analysis), the ERR would also be reduced to around 15%. The other subprojects would still be&#13;
viable. In the main analysis, it is assumed that 25% of all passenger trips have economic value. Tests&#13;
were carried out to calculate the minimum percentage of passenger business trips required to achieve an&#13;
ERR of 15%. For Cirebon and Pemalang, the value could be about half that in the main analysis (10-&#13;
14%), in Semarang it could be about a third lower, while at Demak and Kudus, it could be reduced to a&#13;
quarter of the value in the main analysis. Further details of the economic evaluation results are given in&#13;
Annex 15.&#13;
6.14   Analysis of Institutional Capacity. As reported in Chapter IV, Bina Marga has the capacity to&#13;
deliver road construction projects on time and to an adequate quality standard. BINKOT was able to&#13;
successfully implement the Regional Cities Urban Transport Project, with a PMU supported by&#13;
consultants. It is considered that with similar arrangements, BINKOT has the capacity to implement this&#13;
proposed project. The one area where BINKOT is still developing capacity is the environmental field.&#13;
Support for the development of this capacity is provided in this proposed project While local&#13;
governments are generally able to undertake the smaller scale civil works envisaged in Component B,&#13;
for reasons set out in paragraph 1.22, they currently lack the capacity to plan, design and implement local&#13;
transport policies and traffic management schemes. Support for the development of this capacity is&#13;
provided in this proposed project.&#13;
6.15   Poverty Analysis. No specific analysis has been undertaken of the benefits (or costs) of the&#13;
project to the low income population of the project towns. (Nor has the extent and spatial distribution of&#13;
the low income population of project towns been surveyed except as part of base line surveys for land&#13;
acquisition). Crossing facilities for pedestrians and NMV are included in the road schemes. Provision&#13;
has been made in the design of these road schemes for construction of footpaths and NMV frontage roads&#13;
as required. Sub-component B 1 is specifically designed to benefit pedestrians and NMV users.&#13;
6.16   Environmental Benefits. The environmental aspects of the proposed project are discussed in&#13;
Chapter 5. Residents of the five by-passed towns (Weleri, Kaliwungu, Pemalang, Demak, &amp; Kudus) are&#13;
expected to benefit through reduction of accidents, air pollution and noise. A monitoring program is&#13;
being developed to determine outcomes. However, there is insufficient data available on Indonesian&#13;
conditions to quantify these benefits.&#13;
6.17   Component C: Institutional and Human Resource Development, will increase the overall&#13;
effectiveness of the urban road investment program, and the sustainability of transport policy, as well as&#13;
reduce expenditure on foreign consultants. The benefits will be in improvements in the allocation of&#13;
funds, and greater efficiency in the use of funds at the implementation stage.&#13;
6.18   Component D: The Urban Road Program. Improvements in the allocation of funds for road&#13;
works was one of the five areas suggested in the Road Sector Study to meet the long term challenges in&#13;
the sector. Increasing funding for urban roads is one of these challenges. This component will assist&#13;
decision making on the size of the overall budget for urban road development, as well as the allocation of&#13;
resource by geographical or administrative area and road type. It will also permit the selection of&#13;
individual projects or programs targeted to specific regions in response to GOI initiatives, or targeted to&#13;
address, within a town or region, specific GOI policy initiatives or IUDP. Rolling programs facilitate&#13;
project preparation, and the efficient use of road planning and design resources.&#13;
6.19   Component E: Policy Formulation. The sector study has forecast increases in urban travel&#13;
demand.  The benefit of an urban transport policy is that it will provide the framework for a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 43 -                   StaffAppraisal Report&#13;
comprehensive approach to controlling congestion costs and allocating resources for investment in and&#13;
management of urban transport and urban development. The guidelines and manuals will assist in the&#13;
implementation of this policy as well as in improving efficiency in the use of funds for urban roads at the&#13;
implementation stage.&#13;
C. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
6.20   The sustainability of the project has been assessed in relation to the categories of financial,&#13;
environmental, social, and institutional sustainability adopted in the Bank's Sustainable Transport:&#13;
Priorities for Policy Reform (May 1996).&#13;
Financial Sustainability. The project is designed to assist financial sustainability by making transport&#13;
more cost effective.&#13;
Environmental Sustainability. The project is designed to be environmentally sustainable by:&#13;
*  placing emphasis on integrating environmental considerations into the design process, from the&#13;
stage of problem identification through to construction and operation of individual road sub-&#13;
projects;&#13;
*  implementing urban environmental management measures designed to ensure that the road space in&#13;
towns is not used simply to accommodate extra vehicular traffic; and&#13;
*  strengthening of environment management capability in BINKOT.&#13;
Social Sustainability. The project is designed to be socially sustainable by:&#13;
*  placing emphasis on avoiding resettlement in the planning and design of individual road schemes,&#13;
and in designing and implementing quality resettlement action plans as an integral part of road&#13;
scheme implementation;&#13;
*  including provision for investments to benefit pedestrians and NMT users; and&#13;
*  promoting local government participation in design and implementation.&#13;
Institutional Sustainability. The project is designed to produce a sustainable improvement in the&#13;
management of the urban transport sector by:&#13;
*  placing emphasis on the institutional and human resource development of the responsible agencies,&#13;
and through preparation/updating of guidelines combining international good practice and local&#13;
experience; and&#13;
*  supporting GOI initiatives to decentralize responsibility for urban transport infrastructure and&#13;
services from central to local government level, and in assisting central and local government&#13;
agencies to fulfill their new roles.&#13;
D. RisKs&#13;
6.21   Only Civil Works Implemented. Based on past experience, the major risk of the project is that&#13;
inadequate attention will be paid to the institutional development, HRD and policy components (C, D&#13;
&amp; F) which may compromise the sustainability of the project. The PIM and AWP are designed to&#13;
minimize this risk and to ensure the ownership of, and commitment to these components by their&#13;
implementing agencies. The annual review process is intended to focus attention on components where&#13;
progress is unsatisfactory, and to institute corrective actions. Funding for the road scheme subprojects is&#13;
conditional on the DLLAJ (which will benefit from the component Cl and D) being operational.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic Urban Roads Infrastructure Project  - 44 -                        StaffAppraisal Report&#13;
6.22   Component B Not Implemented. There is also a risk that the sub-projects and activities in&#13;
Component B will not be implemented by the participating local governments. The PIM and AWP are&#13;
designed to minimize this risk and to ensure the ownership of and commitment to the implementation of&#13;
Component B by the participating local governments. The other risks of the project relate to the road&#13;
schemes themselves.&#13;
6.23   Construction Costs and Timing. To minimize construction cost overruns, cost estimates are&#13;
based on Final Engineering Designs to an agreed design specification, and +/-10 % cost limits.&#13;
Construction supervision and project management arrangements within the Project Implementation Plan&#13;
are designed to closely monitor actual costs during construction. Part of this risk is reduced by&#13;
diversification. As this project contains a series of separate road schemes, any problems with one should&#13;
not transfer to the others and the risk to the overall project from any difficulty is reduced. The main&#13;
timing risk relates to land acquisition for critical small sites. Completion of land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement is one condition of issuance of a NOL for starting bidding on civil works.&#13;
6.24   Traffic Risk. There are a number of interconnected traffic risks: (a) overall traffic growth will&#13;
be less than forecast; (b) the amount of traffic using the by pass will be less than estimated; and (c) the&#13;
toll roads will attract more traffic than assumed. To minimize these risks the traffic growth rates in the&#13;
corridor used are based on past trends and are considered conservative. These growth rates are a&#13;
function of the macro-economic growth rates and are therefore susceptible to changes in levels of&#13;
economic activity. The by-passes all offer faster routes and easier driving conditions than the routes they&#13;
replace. To minimize the risk that through traffic will not use the bypass, traffic calming measures in the&#13;
town centers will be implemented under Component B to discourage (but not prevent) through traffic&#13;
from using the existing roads.&#13;
6.25   The extent of diversion to the toll roads (when opened) assumed for the economic analysis is&#13;
greater than the proportion of travelers on recently opened interurban toll roads. In the base case&#13;
evaluation it has been assumed that the opening date of the toll road sections are later than the GOI target&#13;
date, and that these roads will divert 40% of the forecast through traffic using the bypass. (The 40%&#13;
diversion factor is at the mid point of the range of diversions assumed by ADB for the evaluation of&#13;
interurban roads in the corridor.) Sensitivity tests were undertaken assuming the GOI opening date and a&#13;
larger diversion.&#13;
6.26   Toll Roads. There is a risk that the parallel links in the toll road network will be constructed by&#13;
or earlier than the GOI target opening date. Earlier than targeted opening of the toll road would reduce&#13;
the immediacy of the need to build the proposed schemes, and would lead to more staged construction.&#13;
Based on experience to date with toll roads in Indonesia, the risk of an early opening is considered low.&#13;
6.27   Ribbon Development. Experience in Indonesia suggests that the new roads could encourage&#13;
ribbon development alongside, encroachment on agricultural land and creeping urbanization between the&#13;
existing town and the bypass, so that eventually another bypass would be required. To minimize this risk&#13;
the roads are being designed with a ROW sufficient to provide access roads for frontage development at&#13;
a later date if necessary to protect the primary function of the by-pass. Land is being acquired for this&#13;
purpose under this project, or safeguarded through local regulations. Component B is also designed to&#13;
provide means of handling these development pressures in an environmentally sustainable way.&#13;

STRATEGIC URBAN ROADS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
1.   Indicators for monitoring and rating project outcomes against the five project&#13;
development objectives as agreed at negotiations, are shown in Table 1. The baseline&#13;
situation is the current position identified during project preparation, against which the&#13;
progress of the project towards the target outcome will be assessed. This baseline&#13;
position has been identified for all objectives. For objectives a and b the baseline position&#13;
will be precisely defined through surveys.&#13;
2.    The targeted outcomes represent the ideal outcome, if the project performs well,&#13;
and GOI and the Bank respond well to events occurring during the life of the project,&#13;
including unforeseen events over which they may have limited control. Satisfactory&#13;
outcomes have been determined on the basis of those milestones in project&#13;
implementation over which GOI and the Bank can exercise some control, and can take&#13;
corrective action to mitigate poor performance during the life of the project. Reviewing&#13;
performance and taking corrective actions is one focus of the annual review.&#13;
3.    The monitoring indicators chosen for intermediate years for objectives a and b are&#13;
similar to the baseline indicators. For objectives c to e, monitoring will be against&#13;
defined milestones in the implementation schedule towards the target outcome.&#13;

1.0    Cirebon Bypass&#13;
The Cirebon Bypass is a 8.1 kilometer asphaltic concrete (AC) road comprised of three undivided two-&#13;
lane cross-sections separated by two segments of divided four-lane cross sections (Sta 2 + 400 to Sta 3 +&#13;
400 and Sta 4 + 370 to Sta 5 + 700). The original two-lane AC road was constructed in 1970; the 4-lane&#13;
segments (totaling approximately 2.3 kilometers) were widened in 1989/1990 and in 1993/1994. Work&#13;
using APBN funds is currently in progress between Sta 3+380 and Sta 4+380 to widen the roadway to&#13;
four lanes and improve the intersections at Sta 3+810, Sta 4+270 and 4+370. Three-way intersections&#13;
mark the eastern and western extremities of the road segment. The bypass traverses two active rail lines&#13;
near its eastern extremity: the Purwokerto-Yogyakarta line at Sta 6 + 400 (34 trains/day) and the Tegal-&#13;
Semarang line at Sta 7 + 070 (44 trains/day). Both are at-grade crossings controlled by automatic gates.&#13;
The bypass has been divided into three segments. Section I is from Sta 0+000 to 5+991. Section 2 is&#13;
from Sta 5+991 to 8+100 which crosses two railway lines of grade and which may require railway&#13;
flyovers at some future date.  Section 3 is the upgrading and improving of the traffic management&#13;
system for the traffic circle located at the western terminal of the bypass.&#13;
Section 1: The works involve the construction of 5.91 km of roadway which includes widening three 2-&#13;
lane sections to 4-lane divided highway standards and upgrading two segments of existing 4-lane&#13;
roadway to SURIP standards. The works include widening 25 meters of existing bridges and the&#13;
provision of drainage-structures, as well as upgrading and signalizing the intersections at Sta 2+400 and&#13;
Sta 5+510. The road works include common excavation, placement of common and select embankment,&#13;
and construction of the pavement structure and paved shoulder which will include placement of&#13;
Aggregate Classes A and B, and Asphalt Treated Base and Asphalt Concrete. The road works also&#13;
include construction of a raised median, the provision of traffic signals and signs, and road markings.&#13;
Drainage works include the extension of existing culverts, widening of short span bridges and the&#13;
provision of lined drains on both sides of the roadway.&#13;
Section 2: This section crosses two railway lines approximately 600 metres apart. The initial feasibility&#13;
study showed that the construction of an elevated overpass as an alternative to an at-grade crossing gave&#13;
negative rates of return, and would not become economically feasible until higher traffic levels were&#13;
encountered. As an interim solution, therefore, this section is proposed for widening at grade, but&#13;
negotiations with PERUMKA will be required to resolve legal difficulties with upgrading at-grade&#13;
crossings. The Works will continue the designs of Sections 1 and 2, and will require the provision of&#13;
appropriate railway crossings and facilities. FED has not yet been completed for this alternative.&#13;
Section 3: The works for this package consist of upgrading and widening the 3-way intersection at the&#13;
western terminus of the project. It will include revision of the overall junction to improve conditions for&#13;
port traffic joining the national road about 50-75 meters west of the bypass intersection. This project is a&#13;
continuation of the work being done under the ADB-assisted North Java Road Improvement Project&#13;
(NJRIP).&#13;

2.0    Pemalang Bypass&#13;
The proposed Pemalang Bypass is a 4-lane bi-directional bypass located north of and through the city.&#13;
The bypass utilizes the east bound portion of the existing 2-lane diversion road located north of&#13;
Pemalang. Under current conditions the local and through traffic at Pemalang uses a one-way diversion&#13;
system. The westbound heavy traffic must turn left at the outskirts of Pemalang off the North Java&#13;
Transport Corridor (NJTC) main road onto a narrow, 2-lane and low standard local road which traverses&#13;
built-up and residential areas in the southern portion of the city. The diversion road crosses the&#13;
provincial road leading south of Pemalang and rejoins the NJTC main road west of the urbanized area&#13;
and continues a short distance to the kabupaten boundary. This circuitous one-way route, which is&#13;
approximately 14 kilometers long, will be eliminated by construction of the bypass.&#13;
The eastbound heavy traffic follows a diversion route north of the city center and has a length of 9.6&#13;
kilometers. The route begins at the intersection just east of the kabupaten boundary and proceeds&#13;
eastward along the NJTC main road. This 2.6 kilometer section, located on the west side of Pemalang,&#13;
traverses built-up areas with one major intersection and where the right-of-way is constructed. The route&#13;
continues east on the 7.2 kilometer, 2-lane diversion road built in 1992 which passes through mostly&#13;
agricultural areas to the north of Pemalang. The existing eastbound bypass road rejoins the NJTC main&#13;
route east of the city.&#13;
The project is divided into two sections: Section I located between Sta 0+175 and Sta 5+400 and&#13;
Section 2 located between Sta 5+400 and the western terminus of the project located at approximately&#13;
Sta 9+900.&#13;
Section 1 (Sta 0-175 to Sta 5+400): This 5.575 km long section begins east of the Waluh Bridge&#13;
located east of the existing intersection of the NJTC main road and the 2-lane bypass east of Pemalang&#13;
and follows the existing alignment to Station 5+400, a point just east of the new bus terminal&#13;
intersection. The work involves widening and upgrading 4, 575 kilometers of existing 2-lane roadway to&#13;
SURIP 4-lane divided highway standards and the completion of I km of 4-lane roadway currently under&#13;
construction using APBN funding. The project includes 22.6 meters of bridge widening and 105.4 linear&#13;
meters of bridge work for two 2-lane bridge structures to be constructed parallel to the existing bridges.&#13;
The road works required include common excavation, placement of common and select embankment,&#13;
and construction of the pavement structure and paved shoulder which will include placement of&#13;
Aggregate Classes A and B, Asphalt Treated Base and Asphalt Concrete. The road works also include&#13;
construction of a raised median, the provision of traffic signals at the major intersections, traffic signs&#13;
and road markings. Drainage works include the extension of existing culverts and irrigation cross&#13;
structures, replacement of the Baros Bridge with a triple box-culvert, and the provision of lined drains on&#13;
both sides of the roadway. The major works required to complete the project include:&#13;
* Constructing the roadway embankment, pavement section and extension of minor drainage structures&#13;
between Sta 0-175 and Sta 5+400.&#13;
* Construction of a triple box culvert at Sta 5+250.&#13;
* Widening the existing Wahul Bridge at Sta 0+038 from two lanes to three lanes and constructing a&#13;
new two-lane bridge parallel to the existing structure.&#13;
&#13;

(Page 3 of 9)&#13;
* Upgrading and signalizing the three-way inter-section at Sta 0+200.&#13;
*  Constructing a new two-lane bridge parallel to the existing bridge at Sta 2+812.&#13;
Section 2: A number of alternative alignments for this section were investigated during project&#13;
preparation, and of these, widening within the existing alignment is the option preferred by BINKOT, but&#13;
final confirmation and approval will require further limited review of environmental impacts and&#13;
resettlement implications. FED will be finalized following approval of and agreement to this alternative&#13;
by local authorities. Design standards will be as for Section 1, with a basic ROW width of 22m. The&#13;
4.315 km of existing 2-lane road will be widened to 4-lane divided highway standard, and the works&#13;
include:&#13;
* Constructing the roadway embankment, pavement section and extension of minor drainage structures&#13;
between Sta 5+400 and Sta 9+715;&#13;
* Replacing the existing 2-lane bridge at Sta8+268 with a new 4-lane structure, and constructing a new&#13;
2-lane bridge parallel to the existing structure at Sta 9+675;&#13;
* Upgrading the 3-way intersection at Sta 7+082;&#13;
* Upgrading and signalizing the intersections at Sta 5+600, Sta 6+904 and Sta 9+300;&#13;
* Realigning approximately one kilometer of the existing truck route located to the south of the&#13;
national road so that it joins the national road at Sta 9+300.&#13;
3.0    Weleri Bypass&#13;
The Weleri Bypass consists of constructing a new 4.8 kilometer, 4-lane divided bypass road north of and&#13;
around Weleri, to enable heavy and other vehicle through-traffic to avoid Weleri's built-up residential&#13;
areas. Three underpasses will be built to accommodate vehicular and pedestrian traffic on two minor&#13;
roads. The project begins very close to the intersection of the North Java Transport Corridor (NJTC)&#13;
main road with a low-standard road serving Desa Wonotenggang, east of Weleri and ends at a proposed&#13;
new intersection for the NJTC main road near Krajasari to the west of Weleri. Most of the aligmment is&#13;
through agricultural fields, although portions of the proposed project pass close to built-up residential&#13;
areas.&#13;
Beginning in 1993, components of the project were built based on budgetary allocations. Construction of&#13;
the bypass to 2-lane standards was started between the triple box culvert at Sta 1+377 and the underpass&#13;
at Sta 4+244. The components included a 2-lane, 7.5 meter high railroad flyover, various box culverts&#13;
and drainage structures, as well as grading and placement of common embankment along 3.9 kilometers&#13;
of the alignment. The grading and placing of common embankment for the eastern 1.38 kilometer&#13;
section of the bypass started in late 1995. Right-of-way and grading is required on the western section of&#13;
the bypass between Sta 4+250 and Sta 4+800. A 30 meter wide right of way has been acquired for the&#13;
balance of the project.&#13;
The bypass is to be completed under the project. The works, from Sta 1+100 to Sta 5+131, involve&#13;
constructing 4.8 kilometers of 4-lane divided highway to SURIP standards and construction of a new&#13;
31.6 meter-long 2-lane flyover parallel to an existing structure. The road works required to complete the&#13;
project include common excavation, placement of common and select embankment, construction of the&#13;
pavement structure and paved shoulder which will include placement of Aggregate Classes A and B,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Asphalt Treated Base and Asphalt Concrete. The works also include the construction of a raised median,&#13;
the provision of traffic signals at the major intersections, traffic signs and road markings. Drainage&#13;
works include the extension of existing culverts, widening of short span bridges and the provision of&#13;
lined drains on both sides of the roadway. The major works required to complete the 4-lane bypass&#13;
include:&#13;
*      Widening the existing embankment and extending the existing culverts between Sta 1+400 and&#13;
Sta 4+240.&#13;
*      Constructing the roadway embankment, pavement section and extension or construction of minor&#13;
drainage structures for the full length of the bypass, from Sta 0- 100 to Sta 5+131.&#13;
*     Constructing a triple box culvert at Sta 1+377.&#13;
*      Constructing three underpasses at Sta 1+595, Sta 3+108 and Sta 4+244.&#13;
*      Constructing a new 31.6 meter two-lane flyover parallel to the existing flyover at Sta 3+924.&#13;
*      Upgrading and signalize the three way inter-sections at Sta 0+200 and Sta 4+800.&#13;
4.0    Kaliwungu Bypass&#13;
The proposed Kaliwungu Bypass sub-project consists of constructing a new 7.7 kilometer, 4-lane bypass&#13;
to the north of and around Kaliwungu. Construction includes improvements to 0.6 kilometers of the&#13;
existing NJTC road, so the total length of the project is 8.3 kilometers. Two underpasses are to be&#13;
provided to accommodate local pedestrian and vehicular traffic on two minor roads. The bypass begins&#13;
at the unimproved intersection of the North Java Transport Corridor (NJTC) main road with the&#13;
unsurfaced road near the community of Mijen, east of Kaliwungu, and ends at a proposed new&#13;
intersection to be created on the NJTC main road near Brangsong, to the west of Kaliwungu. Most of the&#13;
alignment passes over level terrain and through agricultural fields. Near Desa Sarirejo, it crosses an&#13;
existing access road serving an industrial area (plywood factories, private port facilities) located along&#13;
the coast several kilometers north of the alignment.&#13;
Work on the bypass began in 1992/93 using APBN funding with the construction of a 2-lane, 7.5 meter&#13;
high railroad flyover at the eastern end of the bypass, a 2-lane concrete bridge (Jembatan Kenceng),&#13;
some 22 box culverts, grading and placement of common embankment along some six kilometers of the&#13;
alignment (from Station 0+00 through 6+00). Grading and placement of common embankment for the&#13;
remaining 1.7 kilometers section of the alignment is currently in progress.&#13;
The road works required to complete the project include common excavation, placement of common and&#13;
select embankment, construction of the pavement structures and paved shoulder which will include&#13;
placement of Aggregate Classes A and B. Asphalt Treated Base and Asphalt Concrete as well as&#13;
construction of a raised median, the provision of traffic signals at the major intersections, traffic signs&#13;
and road markings. Drainage works include the extension of existing culverts, widening of short span&#13;
bridges and the provision of lined drains on both sides of the roadway. Under the current SURIP&#13;
implementation schedule, completion of the bypass is divided into two sections. Brief descriptions of&#13;
Sections I and 2 follow.&#13;
Section 1: From Sta 3+300 to Sta 8+100 the work involves constructing 4.8 kilometers of 4-lane divided&#13;
highway, the 2-lane Waridin Bridge and two underpasses. The bridge structure's total length is 31.6&#13;
meters. As given above, the GOI has already started earthworks and drainage structures on this section.&#13;
The major works required to complete the section to 4-lane SURIP standards include:&#13;

* Widening the existing embankment and extending the existing culverts to 4-lane requirements&#13;
between Sta 3+600 and Sta 6+200.&#13;
* Completing construction of the embankment, pavement structure and culverts for the full length of&#13;
the section.&#13;
* Constructing one 31.6 meter 2-lane bridge at Sta 8+000.&#13;
* Constructing underpasses at Sta 3+400 and Sta 4+848.&#13;
* Constructing and signalizing the inter-sections at Sta 7+780.&#13;
Section 2: From Sta 0-200 to Sta 3+300 the work involves constructing 3.5 kilometers of 4-lane divided&#13;
highway, one 2-lane bridge and one 2-lane flyover parallel to the existing structures. The bridge and&#13;
flyover structures have a total length of 63.2 linear meters. As given above, the GOI has already started&#13;
earthworks and drainage structures, and constructed the first 2-lane structures for the Kaliwungu Flyover&#13;
and Kenceng Bridge. The major works required to complete this section of the bypass to 4-lane SURIP&#13;
standards include:&#13;
* Widening the existing embankment and extending the existing culverts to 4-lane requirements&#13;
between Sta 0-200 and Sta 3+300.&#13;
* Completing construction of the embankment, pavement section and culverts for the full length of the&#13;
bypass.&#13;
* Constructing a parallel 31.6 meter-long 2-lane span at the Kaliwungu Flyover, Sta 0+350.&#13;
* Constructing a parallel 31.6 meter long 2-lane span at the Kenceng Bridge, Sta 1+889.&#13;
* Constructing the intersections at Sta 0+200 and Sta 3+400.&#13;
5.0   Semarang Northern Ring Road (SNRR)&#13;
The existing 2-lane SNRR connects the NJTC national highway at the Kalibanteng Roundabout on the&#13;
west side of the city to the northern port area of the city. The road traverses an alluvial plain consisting&#13;
of deep, low strength, highly compressible soils. The ring road was originally constructed under the&#13;
Regional Cities Urban Transport Project (Ln. 2817-IND) in 1992. The SNRR currently terminates at the&#13;
main port entrance. An extension of the SNRR, to connect with the existing road to Demak is planned.&#13;
The first stage, the northern two lanes, is now being tendered for construction under the Bank funded&#13;
Semarang-Surakarta Urban Development Project (Ln. 3749-rND).&#13;
The proposed SNRR project comprises three road sections and one flyover. Sections I and 2 involve&#13;
widening 7.7 km of the existing 2-lane road to SURIP 4-lane divided highway standards, together with&#13;
associated improvements to drainage structures and the provision of three 2-lane bridges having a total&#13;
length of 306 meters constructed parallel to the existing structures.  The project also includes&#13;
constructing 276 meters of new 2-lane railway flyover parallel to the existing Cakrawala Flyover. The&#13;
road works required to complete the project include common excavation, placement of common and&#13;
select embankment, construction of the pavement structure and paved shoulder which will include&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
(Page 6 of 9)&#13;
placement of Aggregate Classes A and B, Asphalt Treated Base and Asphalt Concrete. The works&#13;
include construction of a raised median, the provision of traffic signals at the major intersections, traffic&#13;
signs and road markings. Since the roadway embankment crosses soft ground, a system of fiber wick&#13;
drains, sand blankets and surcharge embankment loading is required to pre-consolidate and strengthen&#13;
the underlying soils. Drainage works include the extension of existing culverts, widening of short span&#13;
bridges and the provision of lined drains on both sides of the roadway.&#13;
Section 1 (Sta 0+500 to Sta 6+100): This section begins between the Kalibanteng traffic circle and the&#13;
Cakrawala Flyover and continues eastward beyond the Kali Semarang Bridge. Most of this section&#13;
requires construction of an embankment on deep highly compressible low strength soils. To allow&#13;
construction in the soft ground areas, special staged construction procedures are required for the&#13;
embankment and bridge abutments. Controlled surcharge embankment, geotextiles and pile foundations&#13;
will be required to control the effects of settlement and to increase the bearing capacity of the underlying&#13;
soils to accelerate its consolidation. The section, which includes 5.6 kilometers of 2-lane roadway&#13;
parallel to the existing road, a new flyover parallel to the existing Cakrawala Flyover, 2 bridges parallel&#13;
to existing structures, and three major intersections, has been divided into two packages:&#13;
Package 1 - extends from Sta 3+550 to Sta 6+100 and includes the following major works:&#13;
*  Widening the existing embankment and extending the existing culverts to 4-lane requirements&#13;
between Stas 3+550 and 6+100 using pre-load techniques.&#13;
-  Constructing the pavement structure, paved shoulders and center median.&#13;
-  Constructing the Banjir Kanal Barat and Kali Semarang 2-lane bridges which have a total length of&#13;
256 meters at Sta 3+890 and Sta 5+550.&#13;
-  Upgrading and signalizing one major intersection at Sta 4+250.&#13;
Package 2 - extends from Sta 0+500 to 3+550 and includes the following major works:&#13;
*  Widening the existing embankment and extending the existing culverts to 4-lane requirements&#13;
between Stas 0+500 and 3+550 using pre-load techniques.&#13;
*  Constructing the pavement structure, paved shoulders and center median.&#13;
*  Constructing an eight span 276 meter 2-lane flyover at Sta 0+777.&#13;
*  Upgrading and signalizing two major intersections at Sta 1+800 and Sta 2+900.&#13;
Section 2 (Sta 6 + 100 to 7 + 695): This section begins between the Kali Semarang and Kalibaru&#13;
Bridges and continues eastward to the main entrance to the port. It includes widening 1.6 kilometers of&#13;
existing 2-lane roadway to four lanes, constructing one 50 meter bridge parallel to existing structure at&#13;
Kalibaru, constructing an underpass at Sta 6+275, frontage roads in the developed areas and two major&#13;
intersections.&#13;
In addition to settlement of the embankment resulting from construction over highly compressible soils,&#13;
soil subsidence caused by over-pumping the underlying artesian aquifer is also a major problem in this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58-&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
(Page 7 of 9)&#13;
area. Consequently, surface water drainage in this area is poor because the mean water surface elevation&#13;
remains constant as the land subsides. The rate of subsidence in approximately 1.5 centimeters a year;&#13;
therefore, much of the infrastructure in the area will have to be raised.1 As with section 1, special staged&#13;
procedures are required to construct the embankment and bridge abutments on the soft ground.&#13;
Controlled surcharge embankment, geotextiles and pile foundation are required to control the effects of&#13;
settlement, to increase the bearing capacity of the underlying soils and to accelerate consolidation.&#13;
Additional ROW on the southern edge of most of this section is needed to accommodate the intersection&#13;
at the main port entrance and the additional 2-lanes required in this area. The required land has been&#13;
identified and is reported to be controlled by government owned and operated companies: its acquisition&#13;
should not be a problem. The major works required to complete Section 2 of the ring road include:&#13;
*  Widening the existing embankment and extending the existing culverts to 4-lane requirements&#13;
between Stas 6+100 and 7+695 using pre-load techniques.&#13;
*  Construction of the pavement structure, paved shoulders and center median.&#13;
*  Constructing the 50 meter 2-lane Kalibaru bridge at Sta 6+460.&#13;
*  Designing and constructing a local traffic underpass at Sta 6+275 and the related frontage roads&#13;
between the underpass and the intersection at Sta 6+800.&#13;
*  Upgrading and signalizing two major intersections at Sta 6+800 and Sta 7+695.&#13;
Section 3: This section begins at the eastern end of Section 2 of the main entrance to the port, and&#13;
continues to a junction with the existing main road to Demak. It consists of the second (southern)&#13;
carriageway of the SNRR extension being funded under SSUDP.&#13;
Kalibanteng Roundabout and Flyover: The roundabout connects the NJTC route with the SNRR. In&#13;
total, it accommodates six approach roads plus a driveway entrance to a proposed hospital. Two&#13;
improvements are proposed here. The first is directed toward short term solutions which include&#13;
improvement of traffic management (signalization) and changes to improve the geometry of the&#13;
roundabout. This work is to be implemented outside of the SURIP program using under APBN funding.&#13;
The second long term improvement, entails the construction of a flyover to accommodate the major&#13;
traffic movements across the roundabout. The most appropriate layout for the flyover is being evaluated.&#13;
6.0    Demak Bypass&#13;
The proposed Demak Bypass is to be constructed to relieve congestion in the built up areas of Demak&#13;
and improve the travel time and speed of through traffic. The bypass intersects the NJTC road to the east&#13;
and west of the city at locations away from the built up areas of the city. It passes through relatively&#13;
level agricultural lands to the south of the center of the town, crosses one minor kabupaten road, crosses&#13;
a major water supply canal and a paved 2-lane provincial road going to Purwodadi. A major intersection&#13;
For example, southern edge of the recently (1990) constructed concretefour lane section of road just to the west&#13;
of the main port entrance is almost at water level. Base and subbase materials were observed to be pumped&#13;
through the construction joints as heavy traffic used the road.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(Page 8 of 9)&#13;
and bridge are to be constructed where the proposed bypass crosses the water supply canal and adjacent&#13;
provincial road. Two bridges are required to cross minor rivers.&#13;
The project involves the construction of 6.967 kilometers of 4-lane divided highway, three 4-lane&#13;
bridges, two 2-lane underpasses and three box culverts as well as three major intersections. The bridge&#13;
structures have a total length of 131 linear meters. Observations indicate that the surfical soils in the area&#13;
contain expansive clays. The roadway embankments are to be constructed with non-expansive materials&#13;
to minimize the effects of expansive soils on embankments and pavement structure.&#13;
The road works required to complete the project include common excavation, placement of common and&#13;
select embankment, construction of the pavement structure and paved shoulder which will include&#13;
placement of Aggregate Classes A and B, Asphalt Treated Base and Asphalt Concrete. The road works&#13;
include construction of a raised median, the provision of traffic signals at the major intersections, traffic&#13;
signs and road markings. Drainage works include the provision of standard culverts, box culverts and&#13;
the provision of lined and unlined drains. The major works required to construct the bypass to 4-lane&#13;
SURIP standards include:&#13;
-  Constructing the embankment, pavement section, and culverts for the full length of the bypass&#13;
between Sta 0+000 and Sta 6+970.&#13;
*  Constructing two 2-lane underpasses for the kabupaten roads at Sta 1+250 and Sta 3+750.&#13;
e  Constructing three 4-lane prestressed girder bridges having a total length of 131 meters at Sta 2+615,&#13;
Sta 3+075 and Sta 5+075.&#13;
*  Constructing and signalizing two major intersections at Sta 0+000 and Sta 6-970.&#13;
7.0    Kudus Southeastern Bypass&#13;
The proposed Kudus Southeastern Bypass consists of constructing a new 10.8 kilometer, 4-lane bypass&#13;
southeast of and around the city center. The bypass begins approximately 4.0 km east of the city center&#13;
where the existing one-way west bound truck route turns south off of the NJTC main road. The bypass&#13;
proceeds south for approximately 3.8 km before it turns westward and continues on another 7 km to the&#13;
intersection of the NJTC main road. The western terminus of the bypass is located approximately 4 km&#13;
southwest of the city center. The Bypass intersects two roads, a kabupaten road at Sta 2+400, and the&#13;
provincial road from Kudus to Purwodadi at Sta 8+600. At Sta 9+300 the bypass forks. The west bound&#13;
traffic continues on to the left on the existing road to the bus terminal and onward to Semarang. The&#13;
right fork carries the east-bound bypass traffic and limited west bound traffic proceeding to the&#13;
Southwest Ring Road and the western limits of Kudus. One bridge structure is to be constructed at Sta&#13;
1+400. Final design of the traffic system at the western terminus of the bypass from the fork in the&#13;
bypass at Sta 9+300 to the Southwest Ring Road and the Bus Terminal is still in progress. Work on the&#13;
bypass using GOI funding has already started between Sta 0+000 and Sta 8+600. In this area culverts&#13;
have been installed and common embankment has been placed for the width of the existing ROW.&#13;
Between Sta 8+600 and the Bus Terminal, the bypass follows the existing road system. Work has not&#13;
started on the right fork of the bypass between Sta 9+300 and Sta 10+400, the junction of the NJTC main&#13;
road and the Southwest Ring Road.&#13;

placement of Aggregate Class A and B, and Asphalt Treated Base and Asphalt Concrete. The road&#13;
works will also include construction of a raised median, the provision of traffic signals at the major&#13;
intersections, traffic signs and road markings. Drainage works include the extension of existing culverts&#13;
and the provision of lined drains on both sides of the roadway. The major works required to complete&#13;
the bypass to 4-lane SURIP standards include:&#13;
*  Completing the existing roadway embankments and extending the existing culverts to 4-lane&#13;
requirements for the full length of the bypass.&#13;
*  Constructing frontage roads in the developed area between Sta 0+000 and Sta 2+450.&#13;
*  Constructing the pavement structure, paved shoulders and the median for the full length of the&#13;
bypass.&#13;
* Constructing lined and unlined drains on both sides of the roadway as required.&#13;
*  Constructing one triple box culvert at Sta 1+400.&#13;
*  Constructing and signalizing the major intersections at Sta 0+000, 2+400, 8+600 and 10+400.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA&#13;
STRATEGIC URBAN ROADS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
COMPONENT A: SuRiP ROAD DESIGN STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES&#13;
I.    The purpose of this annex is to summarize the salient features of the design standards and&#13;
guidelines used for the SURIP bypasses. These have been used by BINKOT in designing the roads, and&#13;
by the BANK in reviewing the designs.&#13;
URBAN ROAD DESIGN STANDARDS&#13;
Functional classification&#13;
2.     Given the estimated traffic volume and the design function, the SURIP bypass are designed for&#13;
Type 11, Class I roadway. Design speed is 60 km/h. This implies that the bypasses are designed as the&#13;
highest standard street of 4 or more lanes with partial access control to serve longer distance, higher&#13;
speed traffic. The basic cross section is 22 meters wide, containing a 2 x 2 lane road with paved&#13;
shoulders. The right of way (ROW) is 40 meter wide except for Cirebon, where a 38 meter ROW has&#13;
been designated for some time.&#13;
Geometric design standards&#13;
3.     With exception of the normal cross slope and vertical grade, the standards are the same as those&#13;
presented in the Standard Specification for Geometric Design of Urban Roads, March 1992 (1992&#13;
Geometric Design Standards, hereinafter). Based upon BINKOT's experience, the recommended&#13;
standard for normal cross slope was increased from 2.0% to 2.5% to improve drainage, and the&#13;
maximum grade was reduced from 5.0% to 4.0% to reduce the impact of steep grades on truck&#13;
movement.&#13;
Cross Section&#13;
4.     The typical cross-section has the following characteristics:&#13;
*   A raised 2 meter wide center median&#13;
*   7.0 meter wide dual carriage ways with 0.5 meter wide margin strips on each side of the&#13;
median&#13;
*   2.0 meter wide paved shoulders, or curbs and side-walks, depending upon urban area needs,&#13;
and&#13;
*   Drainage facility at the outer edges of the ROW&#13;
At intersection locations, the typical 7.5 meter dual carriage ways are widened to 10.25 meter or more to&#13;
accommodate a third lane for turning movements.&#13;

Intersection design&#13;
5.    The 1992 Geometric Design Standards when applied for SURIP bypasses (Type 11, Class I roads&#13;
with a design speed of 60 kilometers) prescribe that all intersections are to be controlled by traffic&#13;
signals. However it was decided that this was not feasible on the SURIP by-passes. Guidelines were&#13;
adopted for SURIP to provide traffic signal controls at all major intersections and restrict access at minor&#13;
cross road intersections. When at-grade access is provided for minor intersections and driveways, it is&#13;
limited to left turning movements, (Left in, Left out).&#13;
Pavement thickness design&#13;
6.     The Bina Marga Method of Component Analysis (SKBI 2.3.26. 1987 - SNI No. 1732-1989-F)&#13;
has been used to design pavement sections for the first year projects. The same design life of 10 years&#13;
has been used for both carriage way and shoulder pavements. The design traffic loading, however, for the&#13;
shoulder pavement is halved from that of the carriage way to account for an anticipated distribution over&#13;
the cross section, which resulted in slightly less structural requirement for the shoulder section than that&#13;
of the carriage way.&#13;
7.    Because widening of the SURIP roads to include frontage roads is anticipated in the future, the&#13;
shoulders have been designed to minimize the construction effort required to widen the roads at a later&#13;
date. The idea of the proposed shoulder section pavement design is to simplify the initial construction at&#13;
the joint between the carriage way and shoulder. (see Detail A of Figure 4 - I)&#13;
Structural design&#13;
8.    All structures are designed for Class I Bina Marga loads in accordance with "Bina Marga&#13;
Loading Specifications for Highway Bridges," SKBI - 1.3.28. 1987, Department Pekerjaan Umum. "The&#13;
Bridge Management System (BMS)" of Directorate General of Highways, Ministry of Public Works,&#13;
Republic of Indonesia and "Standard Specification for Highway Bridges of American Association of&#13;
State Highway and Transportation Officials," 15th edition, 1991 (AASHTO) were used for the design of&#13;
all structures.&#13;
DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR SURIP ROADS&#13;
Safeguarding road function - ROW width, access and land use control&#13;
9.    It was agreed that BINKOT would require limited access control as a condition of providing the&#13;
new road for the Kotamadya and the Kabupaten. This entails making provision for the ultimate design&#13;
stage for frontage roads which provide access for local traffic. However since, except for a limited&#13;
number of road segments, frontage roads are not provided from the initial stage of bypass construction, it&#13;
is important to acquire or designate by local land use control regulation, perda, the ultimate 40 meter&#13;
ROW in order to safeguard the construction of frontage roads at a later stage. Also, it is imperative to&#13;
confirm that the provisional designs of running sections and intersections conform to their ultimate&#13;
designs.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
(Page 3 of 4)&#13;
Design of bypass junctions with existing NJC roads&#13;
10.    Bypass junctions with existing NJC roads should be designed with the bypasses as main routes&#13;
so that the diversion of through traffic to the bypasses may be maximized. Although this concept can be&#13;
best achieved by grade separation, it is recommended that it be used only at such junctions where&#13;
through traffic onto the bypass is required to make right turns and grade separation is economically&#13;
justified. Junctions which do not require right turns for the through traffic should be designed with&#13;
continuous flow lanes for through traffic without using grade separation. As a result, only the eastern&#13;
junctions of Kaliungu is recommended to be designed with grade separation.&#13;
Guidelines for the provision of major intersection, minor intersection and underpass and future&#13;
upgrade thereof&#13;
I.    Clear guidelines should be developed regarding the provision of major and minor intersections,&#13;
and underpasses (where no access is provided from the minor road to the bypass and vice versa). The&#13;
guidelines should delineate conditions for providing these different intersections and underpasses in&#13;
terms of conditions of the crossing roads themselves, such as functional classification of the roads, and&#13;
the situational conditions including the distances from the neighboring intersections, etc. Guidelines&#13;
should also be developed for the conditions for upgrading intersection types and provision of lamps&#13;
connecting grade separated minor roads with the bypass.&#13;
U-turns&#13;
12.   No U-turns without proper design should be allowed on the SURIP bypasses. All designs should&#13;
be reviewed to ensure that appropriate provisions are made to all movements on the bypass so that no&#13;
vehicles are required to travel excessive distance without resorting to U-turns. U-turn provision should&#13;
be made only when it is deemed to be the only feasible solution. Guidelines should be developed for the&#13;
provision of U-turns designs which clearly delineates conditions under which the U-turns provision is&#13;
warranted. The guidelines should also include standard designs for U-turns. A possible standard design&#13;
was discussed during the appraisal mission.&#13;
Pedestrians, NMVs and slow moving vehicles&#13;
13.    All road segments along the bypasses should be identified where slow moving vehicle, NMV and&#13;
pedestrian traffic volumes are deemed to be high. All geometric designs for such segments should be&#13;
reviewed to ensure the safe and smooth travel of these traffic. Frontage roads should be designed and&#13;
constructed from the initial stage wherever possible and necessary (particularly at intersections) to ensure&#13;
this requirement and to reduce side friction for motorized vehicle traffic. Parallel roads should also be&#13;
investigated in this design process to identify possible alternative means for providing appropriate routes&#13;
to pedestrians and NMVs.&#13;
14.    The safe passage of pedestrians and NMVs must be addressed in the design of all locations&#13;
where bypasses cut across existing pedestrian/NMV paths and no intersections are provided. The&#13;
measures to be considered include underpass, median cutting and traffic island.&#13;

Hydrology and hydraulic analysis&#13;
15.   Hydrology and hydraulic analyses shall be done in the design of bridges and other major&#13;
drainage structures to determine the waterway requirements for the particular structure. .It was learned,&#13;
however, that such analyses have not been done so far in the preparation of SURIP projects. The practice&#13;
in Indonesia has often been to proceed with design without doing these analyses and to verify the&#13;
fulfillment of hydrologic and hydraulic requirements expost. Appropriate modifications to the design, if&#13;
found necessary, are accommodated in the field in the form of change orders. Apparently, this is not a&#13;
sound practice, and therefore, it is strongly recommended that the appropriate hydrology and hydraulic&#13;
analyses be preceded to the design of bridges and other major drainage structures. The Bridge&#13;
Investigation Manual stipulates the procedures to be used for such analyses and should be used as SURIP&#13;
guidelines..&#13;
Pavement design method&#13;
16.   The Project Preparation  Document should clearly describe the method used for conducting&#13;
structural analysis of the pavement..&#13;

COMPONENT B: URBAN MANAGEMENT AND "QUALITY OF "LIFE" IMPROVEMENTS&#13;
OUTLINE SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES&#13;
Bl. TRAFFIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLANS&#13;
I1.    Preparation of plans for the existing road and adjacent areas, to change the function of the road&#13;
through the town from a primary arterial to a local traffic street or collector road, where the requirements&#13;
of pedestrians, NMV and local traffic movements take precedence over longer distance traffic. This is&#13;
done by a series of measures designed to make the route less attractive for longer distance traffic which&#13;
does not wish to stop in the town, and also designed to make the road safer for pedestrians and NMV.&#13;
2.    The plan will focus on measures to:&#13;
(a)   reduce the traffic function of the existing main road by reducing the road capacity,&#13;
altering the horizontal alignment to reduce speeds, removing or modifying parking restrictions&#13;
except where necessary for road safety, improving at grade pedestrian crossings, or closure of&#13;
short sections to create pedestrian areas, or to improve the setting of important buildings.&#13;
(b)    ensure the safety of the road user, especially the pedestrian by providing sidewalks,&#13;
pedestrian crossing, bicycle lane, traffic lights, road marking etc.;&#13;
(c)    prevent local traffic congestion  by improving traffic management and enforcement,&#13;
providing bus stops, appropriate parking space and restrictions, improving control over roadside&#13;
activities that encroach on the roadspace;&#13;
(d)    enhance amenity by greening/ tree planting, improved sidewalks and other measures;&#13;
3.    Specific measures to consider in preparation of traffic and environmental management plans&#13;
(i)    Traffic Management, Circulation and Parking Scheme. This will consist of the following&#13;
elements that together will comprise an integrated approach to improvement of the urban area:&#13;
*  traffic management and minor improvements on existing and proposed roads to&#13;
disperse traffic more efficiently;&#13;
*  parking policies to improve and control on-street parking;&#13;
*  improvement of facilities for pedestrians;&#13;
*  public transport improvements including bus priority measures, stops, circulation&#13;
and terminal improvements.&#13;
(ii)   Protection of Sensitive Local Areas from  truck intrusion by use of local area&#13;
management measures.&#13;
(iii)   Route Enhancement: along existing local roads that provide a vital connectivity and&#13;
therefore in functional terms a secondary role&#13;
* traffic management may be needed to increase capacity;&#13;

B2. STRUCTURE PLAN REVIEW.&#13;
5.    Ensuring that the layout, function and improvements planned for the town road network reflect&#13;
the presence of the by-pass and the ability of the by-pass to take the through traffic as well as the longer&#13;
distance intra-urban traffic. This requires a review of the road network shown in the Strategic Structure&#13;
Plan, and improvement proposals in the PJM of the IUDP, and amendments as appropriate, including&#13;
additional works that could be funded through SURIP.&#13;
B3. PROTECTION OF THE FUNCTION AND RIGHT OF WAY (ROW) OF THE BY-PASS:&#13;
6.    Ensuring that the land use plans and regulations of the town make provision for dealing with the&#13;
development pressure that will arise along the by-pass. This has several aspects:&#13;
*  defining a 40 m ROW for by-pass, with access via junctions at locations governed by highway&#13;
design criteria, and limited or no access elsewhere;&#13;
* protecting the ROW with local government regulations;&#13;
*  protecting the ROW with physical measures such as drainage ditches, embankments and walls;&#13;
*  providing sites close to the junctions for commercial development;&#13;
-  providing access roads from the junctions to these sites.&#13;
TIME BASED PROGRAM FOR PREPARATION OF COMPONENT B&#13;
7.    Overview: The basis of the program is the assumption that the "Quality of Life" (QLI)&#13;
subprojects will be planned during the completion of the bypass subproject, but designs will not be&#13;
finalized until after some period of operation of the bypass has elapsed. For this purpose, it is assumed&#13;
that project preparation for the QLI subprojects needs to be completed three months after opening of the&#13;
new bypass, On this basis, the attached Implementation Schedule shows the various stages and their time&#13;
dependency. Particular aspects of the program are noted below.&#13;
8.    Relationship with DLLAJ Unit Setup and Staff Training: Assuming that an immediate start&#13;
can be made in setting up the DLLAJ units by the respective Bupati/Walikota and MHA, and allocating&#13;
26 weeks for this to occur, it can be seen that this will be completed before the TA Services for Training&#13;
DLLAJ staff will commence. It can be seen from the attached Schedule that DLLAJ training will be&#13;
completed well before there is a need to begin QLI program planning in any city.&#13;
9.    Elements of the Project Preparation Process: It is apparent from the attached Schedule that&#13;
completing designs after three months operation of the bypass delays completion of QLI program&#13;
implementation until 18 months after bypass completion. It has been assumed that planning consultants&#13;
will be procured for each city. For cities where bypasses will be constructed in a number of sections&#13;
and/or packages of civil works, with completion dates several years apart, separate QLI packages will&#13;
also be required.&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA&#13;
STRATEGIC URBAN ROADS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT.&#13;
OUTLINE SCOPE OF POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES&#13;
COMPONENT A: ROAD CONSTRUCTION&#13;
(a)    Scheme planning and design. The topics to be covered, the milestones and the elapsed time necessary&#13;
in the process from initial concept through to final engineering design of a road scheme are not well understood.&#13;
This manual, which should be prepared by the PMU with consultant support, would cover the whole process for&#13;
all aspects of a road scheme including engineering , economics, environment, land acquisition, resettlement,&#13;
finance, and public participation.&#13;
COMPONENT B1: TRAFFIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL AREA MANAGEMENT PLANS&#13;
(b)    Traffic Management. DGLT has published a Traffic Engineering Handbook in Bahasa Indonesia. This&#13;
needs to be expanded to include good examples of "Quality of Life" improvements, as well as the methodology for&#13;
undertaking traffic management studies of the type to be undertaken in Component B of this project.&#13;
COMPONENT C2: STRENGTHENING OF BINKOT AMDAL SECTION&#13;
(c)    Environment. The project will support continued development jointly by the GOI and the Bank of a&#13;
policy statement and guidelines for urban roads and the environment, to reflect international good practice. This&#13;
development work will draw on the recently published TWU Report 13 'Roads and the Environment: A&#13;
Handbook" which has been translated into Bahasa Indonesia. These guidelines could then be refined in the&#13;
implementation of SURIP schemes, and the planning and design of other BINKOT road schemes. This policy&#13;
work will complement the Institutional Development of BINKOT AMDAL section.&#13;
(d)    Resetlement. Detailed Bank policy guidelines and good practice for urban road schemes are being&#13;
developed. The project will support work jointly by GOI and the Bank to develop a policy statement and best&#13;
practice guidelines to ensure to the extent possible the living standards of people affected or resettled as a result&#13;
of urban road schemes in Indonesia have their living standards improved or at least restored. These guidelines&#13;
could then be refined in the preparation of any future Bank funded road projects.&#13;
COMPONENT E2: PLANNING PROGRAMMING AND EXECUTION OF URBAN ROADs WORKS&#13;
(e)    Feasibility Studies.  There appears to be no accepted definition in Indonesia of what constitutes a&#13;
"Feasibility Study". This manual will provide such a definition and examples of good practice.&#13;
(f)    Functional Design Guidelines. The SURIP road design guidelines in Annex 6 evolved during the&#13;
preparation of this project. They will formn the basis for good practice guidelines to be used for the preparation of&#13;
road schemes for future primary urban road projects, including but not limited to SURIP Projects.&#13;
(g)    Economic Evaluation. Standard methodologies are currently being used to evaluate road schemes, and&#13;
the results are robust, but each project or study customizes the process. The resulting models are not user&#13;
friendly and it is doubtful they could be run by a local highway engineer with assistance from a local transport&#13;
economist. "What if" scenarios to do sensitivity tests on key variables are not easily done. BINKOT needs to&#13;
develop models and software that are user friendly and standard across all projects of similar scope.&#13;
(b)    Technical Memorandum on Urban Roads for IUDP. The memorandum currently in general use (due&#13;
to the lack of any other material) was prepared in 1988 by consultants as a Technical Report for the original East&#13;
Java IUIDP. There is general agreement that it needs to be updated, and issued as a BINKOT Manual.&#13;

STRATEGIC URBAN ROADS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
ENVIROMENTAL IMPACT ASSESMENT:&#13;
CRITICAL ISSUES To BE INCLUDED IN DOCUMENTATION&#13;
1.       Description of Existing Situation&#13;
On a map of scale not less than 1:1000 or where these are not available on a carefully prepared schematic&#13;
representation of the study area.&#13;
* identify existing land use on either side of the road (and estimate area(s)&#13;
identify on either side of the road numbers of people and housing or community facilities affected&#13;
by the project with their exact location&#13;
* identify drainage patterns and comment on local hydrology e.g. where are the existing streams and is&#13;
there any history of flooding in the area&#13;
indicate whether the soils are sandy, silty or clayey&#13;
indicate any trees which may be affected by the road&#13;
measure existing traffic volume on existing roads and identify their present function&#13;
identify any existing traffic hazards&#13;
c comment on existing sources of noise (both stationary and moving sources)&#13;
* measure the existing noise with a hand held noise monitor three times per day (once in the morning&#13;
once in the afternoon and once at night) at the same locations where traffic volumes are collected.&#13;
c comment on existing air quality.&#13;
2.       Proposed Road Scheme&#13;
2.1      For each stage of the proposed road scheme provide:&#13;
* an assessment of the impact of the project on traffic volume and day/night distribution&#13;
* a brief assessment of the noise impact e.g. will the noise level increase by more than 5 dB(A) in the&#13;
housing areas&#13;
* a brief assessment of impact on safety e.g. will the project affect the safety of pedestrians and non&#13;
motorized vehicles (NMV)&#13;
* a brief assessment of anticipated changes in air quality&#13;
a qualitative assessment of how the project will affect local businesses and industries&#13;
* a brief assessment of how the project will affect the quality of life of local residents in the immediate&#13;
vicinity of the proposed sub-project.&#13;
2.2      If noise levels are anticipated to increase by more than 5 dB(A) in residential areas or on community&#13;
facilities such as schools or hospitals, then a proposal to mitigate or manage the problem should be included in the&#13;
UKL/RKL and a proposal to monitor implementation should be included in the UPL/RPL. This proposal should be&#13;
discussed with the project manager in BINKOT. If barrier construction is anticipated a pro forma design should&#13;
included. If relocation is considered to be the preferred option then evidence the process to relocate the houses,&#13;
school or hospital has been started should be included.&#13;

(Page I of 8)&#13;
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA&#13;
STRATEGIC URBAN ROADS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    This annex provides some details of the inputs and outputs of the economic analysis of&#13;
the seven road scheme sub-projects in component A of the project. Further information on&#13;
inputs, methodology and sensitivity testing is provided in documents on the project file.&#13;
2.    Scheme Details and Total Costs. The schemes analyzed are those described in Annex&#13;
3, except as noted below. The sub project length for analysis is the distance between the centre&#13;
lines of the junctions with the existing North Java Corridor at the start and end of the sub-project.&#13;
This may be less than the road length included in the engineering designs which will generally&#13;
also include all of the junction at either of the sub project.&#13;
- Cirebon By pass - the costs include section 3 (the western junction), and an at grade&#13;
crossing of both railways in section 2.&#13;
* Pemalang. - the costs are for alternative 1, which includes widening of the existing&#13;
road over section 2 - the western section of the by pass.&#13;
- Semarang Northern Ring Road -the costs are for sections I &amp; 2, excluding the&#13;
construction of the Kalibanteng Flyover.&#13;
3.    Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) Savings. The VOC savings have been calculated by&#13;
comparing VOC on the existing and new (bypass sub project) roads with the VOC on the&#13;
existing road without the new bypass for the forecast traffic volumes at five year intervals. VOC&#13;
on the existing road are forecast to grow faster than the forecast growth in traffic as congestion&#13;
builds up.&#13;
4.    The rate of growth of VOC savings will be reduced at the time of opening of toll road&#13;
sections parallel to the sub project. It has been assumed that 40% of the by pass traffic will&#13;
divert to the parallel toll road section.&#13;
5.    The Kaliwungu by pass is longer than the existing road. As a result, for the initial years&#13;
of operation of the by pass VOC are greater than on the existing road, and overall accident&#13;
benefits are much higher than VOC benefits.&#13;

            Indonesia - Strategic Urban Roads
            Infrastructure Project (SURIP)

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Strategic Urban
            Roads Infrastructure Project are to: 1) reduce traffic
            bottlenecks on the national roads in selected urban areas in
            the North Java corridor; 2) address the environmental and
            social issues associated with the increased usage of the
            national road network in these urban areas; 3) assist the
            government of Indonesia (GOI) in the process of
            decentralizing responsibility for the planning, design,
            construction, maintenance, management and regulation of
            urban transport from central to local government as set out
            in recent government regulations; 4) strengthen technical
            and institutional capabilities, particularly with respect to
