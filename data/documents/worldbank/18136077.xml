            Is it possible to register a limited
            liability company anonymously? According to data from the
            2012 World Bank entrepreneurship database, a majority of the
            economies surveyed require the name of the principal owner
            of a limited liability company at the time of registration.
            But a large share of the economies does not require further
            proof of the identity of the person listed as the principal
            owner. Analysis of the data finds a positive relationship
            between greater ownership anonymity and new firm
            registrations. Data from the 2012 entrepreneurship database
