                  Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project&#13;
                         in the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#13;
&#13;
1 Context andStrategy&#13;
1.1 Background&#13;
&#13;
1. Since the early 1990s, the Great Lakes region has been embroiled in a series o f closely&#13;
interlinked conflicts directly affecting the territory o f the Democratic Republic o f Congo&#13;
(DRC). These conflicts stem from a complex interaction o f poor governance, politics o f&#13;
ethnic exclusion, security dilemmas and competition for the control o f economic rents.&#13;
The war in the DRC started as a Congolese civil war, but drew in two opposing regional&#13;
blocs. Unfinished civil wars and regional rivalries were also being fought out inthe Congo,&#13;
with the use o f local proxies adding fuel to the fire o f local domestic conflicts, especially in&#13;
Ituriandthe Kivus.&#13;
&#13;
2. Since January 2001, there has been significant progress towards peace and&#13;
reconciliation, within the context o f the 1999 Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement. The&#13;
centerpieces o fthis progress are:&#13;
&#13;
(9      TheInter-Congolese Dialogue: On April 2,2003 inSun City, the participants inthe&#13;
        Inter-Congolese Dialogue signed the Final Act o f the inter-Congolese political&#13;
        negotiations, endorsing agreements that constitute a comprehensive program for the&#13;
        restoration of peace and national sovereignty during a transition period o f two&#13;
        years. The agreements include the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement on the&#13;
        Transition in the Democratic Republic o f the Congo (December 2002), the&#13;
        Transitional Constitution, the memorandum on military and security issues (March&#13;
        2003), and the 36 resolutions adopted by the Inter-Congolese Dialogue in Sun City&#13;
        (March and April 2002). ). Within this framework, all sides in the armed conflict&#13;
        engaged in political negotiations, including the political opposition and civil&#13;
        society, and formed a Transitional Government, on June 30 2003.The Comitk&#13;
        International pour 1'Accompagnement de la Transition (CIAT), which includes&#13;
        most intemational partners, continues to support this process through its Committee&#13;
        on Political and Security Affairs.&#13;
(ii) Thedisarmamentanddemobilizationofforeign armedgroups:TheUnitedNations&#13;
        Mission to the DRC, MONUC, was established in 1999 to monitor the cease-fire&#13;
        agreement and develop an action plan for its implementation, including the&#13;
        Disarmament,     Demobilization,      Repatriation,    Resettlement    and    Reinsertion&#13;
        (DDRRR) o f foreign armed groups operating in the DRC. There remain an&#13;
        estimated 15,000 foreign combatants to be disarmed, demobilized and repatriated.&#13;
(iii) Thewithdrawalofforeig. troops:TheGovernmentofDRCsignedagreementswith&#13;
        the Governments o f Rwanda (July 2002) and Uganda (September 2002) that paved&#13;
        the way for a withdrawal o f foreign troops.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project-Technical Annex                    3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(iv)    On July 28, 2003 the mandate o f MONUC was extended to include the&#13;
        demobilization o f Congolese combatants (Resolution 1493,2003).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The situation in Ituri and in the Kivus, requires special attention. An expanding UN force&#13;
and the Dar-Es-Salaam ceasefire agreement (May 2003) signed by irregular Ituri forces,&#13;
and the establishment o f the Administration interimaire de Z'Ituri have helped stabilize the&#13;
area and allowed planning for DDR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Economic and Social Impact&#13;
&#13;
3.      Africa's third-largest nation is gradually emerging from five years o f a violent&#13;
conflict termed Africa's first continent-scale war, compounding the legacy o f decades o f&#13;
poor governance. The conflict's impact is dramatic.&#13;
&#13;
4.      An estimated 3.5 millionpeople have died since 1998, both from the violence itself&#13;
and from starvation and disease, making this conflict the deadliest since World War 11. An&#13;
estimated 3 million people are displaced, with 500,000 refugees inneighboring countries.&#13;
Schools and training centers have closed leaving a generation without education. Hospitals,&#13;
clinics and preventative health initiatives have been devastated with yet unmeasured&#13;
consequence.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The conflict has exacerbated ethnic rivalries and tensions over landand territory in&#13;
eastern Congo posing a long-term challenge to the transition to peace.&#13;
&#13;
6.      The economy, already affected by decades o f poor governance, has collapsed. Per&#13;
capita income has declined steadily from US$380 in 1985 to US$250 in 1990 and to US$85&#13;
in2000. Infrastructure, which was deteriorating under the Mobuturegime, hasbeen largely&#13;
destroyed during the conflict, leaving few roads and only sporadic access to electricity and&#13;
safe water.&#13;
&#13;
1.2   Government Response and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
7. Since 2001, the Government has launched a program o f economic reforms, aimed at&#13;
restoring macro-economic stability, and kick-starting economic activity, while tackling&#13;
some governance issues inherited from the past. This program is being implemented with&#13;
the support o f the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund(IMF). Inparticular, a&#13;
$1.7 billion Emergency Multi-sector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program&#13;
(EMRRP), $454 million of which is provided by the Bank, was broadly endorsed by all&#13;
parties to the inter-Congolese dialogue and aims to restore connectivity, rehabilitate social&#13;
infrastructure and improve food security. The Emergency Economic and Social&#13;
Reunification Project ($214 million), approved in September 2003, targets reunified areas.&#13;
Economic growth returned in2002, after a decade o f contraction.&#13;

&#13;
8. The government has recently laid out the responsibilities o f the different ministries with&#13;
respect to demobilization and reinsertion. Responsibility for demobilization rests with the&#13;
Ministry of Defense, while responsibility for reinsertion has been placed in the Ministry o f&#13;
Social Affairs with the Ministry o f Solidarity and Humanitarian Affairs being given a&#13;
supporting role inthe reinsertion o f ex-combatants into communities. The government has&#13;
established the institutional structure for DDR in a series o f decrees (December 2003).&#13;
This includes the Interministerial Committee for DDR to oversee DDR activities&#13;
nationally, the National Commission for DDR (CONADER) to coordinate preparation and&#13;
implementation of the national program, and the Committee to Manage Financial&#13;
Resources to coordinate funding for DDR (CGFDR).&#13;
&#13;
9.       On security sector reform, the transitional government has advanced the process o f&#13;
the restructuring of the army with the support from international partners. Presently the&#13;
major armed groups have been combined into the FA-RDC and a unified command&#13;
structure put inplace.&#13;
&#13;
InternationalResponse&#13;
&#13;
10.      The international community has been re-engaging inDRC over the past three years&#13;
following nearly a decade o f suspension o f activities. It has supported and encouraged the&#13;
peace-process and backed the government by resuming a number o f development&#13;
initiatives that had been suspended. A Consultative group o f major donors agreed on a&#13;
coordinated support strategy for DRC in Paris in 2002.             Another Consultative Group&#13;
meeting held inDecember 2003 resulted inthe commitment o f nearly $4 billion insupport&#13;
ofDRC's recovery efforts.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Not least has been the considerable humanitarian effort mounted by the UN&#13;
agencies, ICRC and International NGOs. These continue to provide essential support to&#13;
health and other services particularly in the East. The rapid deterioration of the&#13;
humanitarian situation in the Ituri region in 2003 led to a European Union armed peace-&#13;
imposing mission ledby France, which has since been taken over byMONUC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.3 Multi-country Demobilization and Reintegration Program&#13;
&#13;
14.      In a bid to coordinate their efforts in the field of DDR in the Great Lakes sub-&#13;
region, the Bank and a number o f the main donor countries decided to establish, in 2002,&#13;
the Multi-country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP), a multi-donor,&#13;
regional approach to support and facilitate the process o f demobilization and reintegration&#13;
in the Greater Great Lakes region. The MDRP trust fund supports special projects in&#13;
preparation o f the national program and the national program itself. Six special projects&#13;
have been approved, four o f these focus on the demobilization o f children associated with&#13;
the armed forces, one supports pilot DDR activities in the field, and one supports a rapid&#13;
response mechanism for emergency situations as well as assistance to the design o f a&#13;
national DDRprogram.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project-TechnicalAnnex                       5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15.      A regional approach offers several key advantages including: exchange o f&#13;
information between national programs; the creation o f synergies allowing MDRP to have&#13;
a greater impact on national programs; availability to all parties in the conflict o f identical&#13;
measures to assist them in continuing the peace process; the capacity to take into account&#13;
regional impacts associated with some o f the programs and; increased transparency in&#13;
associated national programs.&#13;
&#13;
16.      The MDRP secretariat manages the multidonor regional trust fund set up to support&#13;
demobilization and reintegration in the greater Great Lakes region. These funds serve as a&#13;
means o f mobilizing and channeling resources provided by key donors; it reduces the&#13;
transaction costs for participating governments, donors, and the Bank and allows bilateral&#13;
donors to complement IDA resources with grants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2    IDA Response and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
17.      In October 1997, the Bank allocated a US$ 2 million Post Conflict grant to assist&#13;
the newly installed government o f President Laurent-D6sir6 Kabila, to tackle immediate&#13;
post conflict challenges. The specific objectives o f that grant were to: (i)prepare a&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration Program for vulnerable groups; and (ii)launch&#13;
community-based activities inthe Eastern provinces o f the country. Lessons learned from&#13;
the grant evaluation are feeding into the preparation o f the national DDR program. IDA&#13;
has prepared its assistance withinthe framework established by the MDRP strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.1    Poverty Reduction Strategy&#13;
&#13;
18.      Since 2002, the Government has been implementing an I-PRSP based on wide&#13;
consultations with civil society and community groups. Although it was developed by a&#13;
previous government, the Inter-Congolese Dialogue and later the new Transition&#13;
Government endorsed this work. The I-PRSP rests upon three pillars: (i)        restoration and&#13;
consolidation of peace and sustainable good governance; (ii)       macroeconomic stabilization&#13;
and pro-poor growth; and (iii)community dynamics (community-led development&#13;
initiatives).&#13;
&#13;
19.      The Government has been developing its full PRSP through a representative and&#13;
participatory process. The Joint Staff Assessment o f the I-PRSP and the 2003 annual up-&#13;
date have beenreviewed by the Boards o f IDA and the IMF. With efforts continuing at the&#13;
current pace, the full PRSP is expected by the fourth quarter of 2005. The successful&#13;
implementation o f the National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reinsertion Program&#13;
(PNDDR) is a critical part o f the first pillar o fthe I-PRSP.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
20.     Transitional Support Strategy (TSS).               The TSS (July 2001) identified meeting&#13;
basic and urgent needs, including a focus on demobilization and reintegration, as a key&#13;
challenge. The Consultative Group meetings (Paris, December 4-5, 2002 and December&#13;
17-19, 2003) included DDR as one o f four priorities to support the Congolese strategy&#13;
towards economic and social reunification. A new TSS was discussed by the Board in&#13;
February 2004.        This TSS identifies the restoration o f stability and security as a key&#13;
challenge in D R C and singles out DDR as one o f the critical factors in addressing this&#13;
challenge. The DRCDRP is an integral part o f the strategy.&#13;
&#13;
21.    Restructuring existing credits. The existing IDA portfolio consists o f 5 projects&#13;
with satisfactory performance. There is considerable scope to develop synergies between&#13;
this project and existing projects particularly interms o freintegration activities.&#13;
&#13;
2.2   Rationale for IDA involvement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
23.     The request from the government for technical and financial assistance to&#13;
implement the national DDR program comes in a critical period for regional peace. IDA'S&#13;
participation is justified in view o f its considerable experience with such programs, the&#13;
volume o f funding required, the stress the program will put on social and economic&#13;
reintegration o f ex-combatants, as well as the need to respond to a client request to&#13;
coordinate international support.           IDA assistance will complement efforts by other&#13;
international actors already underway inthe DRC and inthe region.&#13;
&#13;
24.     The IDA grant will be complemented by MDRP grants both for co-financing the&#13;
nationalprogram and for financing special projects already underway.&#13;
&#13;
25.    Need for Emergency Assistance. The application o f the Bank's emergency&#13;
procedures under OP 8.50 isjustified by:&#13;
&#13;
        (9        Theprogram's impact on economic priorities and investment programs. The&#13;
                  program provides the means to consolidate social and economic recovery in&#13;
                  the DRC and in the region. Without a successful demobilization and&#13;
                  reintegration program there is a much greater danger that disaffected ex-&#13;
                  combatants will turn to violence.&#13;
        (ii) Itscriticalcontributiontothestabilizationof thesocietyandeconomy.The&#13;
                  transition in the DRC and the peace process throughout the region can be&#13;
                  supported by specific stabilization measures. The demobilization and&#13;
                  reintegration o f ex-combatants is a key element o f this process within the&#13;
                  current window o f opportunity;&#13;
        (iii) The urgency to demobilize and provide reintegration assistance to ex-&#13;
                  combatants. The current transition government does not have the resources&#13;
                  to pay all people currently inthe various military goups. I t must, as soon as&#13;
                  possible, start demobilizing large numbers and returning them to civilian&#13;
                  life.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project - TechnicalAnnex                       7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26.     Making resources available for development. Persistent insecurity in the Great&#13;
Lakes Region has led to a shift in resources away from social and economic development&#13;
towards the security sector. A successful national DDR program will allow the shift o f&#13;
government expenditures away from defense and towards social and economic&#13;
development. A reduction o f defense spending will also help reduce the budget deficit and&#13;
therefore constitutes an important factor for macroeconomic and fiscal stability in the long&#13;
term.&#13;
&#13;
2.3   Lessons learned from other IDA projects&#13;
&#13;
27.    .IDA has acquired substantial experience in this sector through support for DDR&#13;
programs throughout Africa and in other regions (Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Djibouti,&#13;
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Chad, East&#13;
Timor). This experience has often taken the form o f technical assistance and/or financial&#13;
assistance through investment credits, programs o f balance o f payments support or&#13;
restructuring on-going projects. Building on lessons learned from relevant projects in&#13;
Africa and on the conclusions o f the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department, several&#13;
good practices have been identified and are integratedinto the program.&#13;
&#13;
28.     Demobilization. Although short, this phase is logistically complex.             Successful&#13;
demobilization is a necessary first step toward successful reintegration. Among the key&#13;
actions are the distribution o f non-transferable        demobilization cards, the collection of&#13;
socio-economic date and the establishment o f a comprehensive database o f beneficiaries.&#13;
Inaddition, regrouping ex-combatants during demobilization provides a good opportunity&#13;
to give health and HIV/AIDS counseling, voluntary HIV/AIDS testing and information&#13;
about re-entry into civilian life and the responsibilities o f citizenship (voting etc.).&#13;
&#13;
29.     Reinsertion. During demobilization, ex-combatants lose their source o f income&#13;
(formal or informal). Experience suggests that their financial situation is generally&#13;
precarious untilthey can re-establish new revenue generating activities. Duringthis period&#13;
(the reinsertion phase) they need a transitional safety net (TSN) to cover the essential&#13;
material needs o f their families.      The objective o f this support is to permit the ex-&#13;
combatants to retum to their communities and to see to the needs o f their families in a&#13;
limited time period following demobilization.&#13;
&#13;
30.     Economic Reintegration. Ex-combatants are often an economically vulnerable&#13;
group due to their lack o f relevant skills, capital and social networks. In addition, they are&#13;
often a group at risk because o f their familiarity with guns and violence.              Targeted&#13;
assistance is recommended to help them find viable economic strategies.              To be cost-&#13;
efficient and effective, assistance must be adapted to their socio-economic profiles and the&#13;
economic environment.        Female soldiers often require special assistance to achieve&#13;
economic self-sufficiency.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex                   8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
31.     Generally, the assistance received by ex-combatants should not exceed the amount&#13;
necessary to achieve the average standard o f living o f the communities in which they are&#13;
reintegrating. In addition, reintegration assistance must be o f limited duration to avoid&#13;
creating dependency. Information services and counseling can help ex-combatants analyze&#13;
their options and find employment. Apprenticeships in the informal sector linked to&#13;
employment are preferred to stand alone training programs.&#13;
&#13;
32.    Ultimately, ex-combatants are reintegrated into the general economy. Therefore,&#13;
creation o f long-term employment is closely linked to growth in the private sector and the&#13;
creation o f employment. It should be noted that ex-combatants themselves represent an&#13;
important source o fhumanresources for the economy.&#13;
&#13;
33.    Social Reintegration. Social reintegration is often facilitated by the existence o f an&#13;
extended family network. Therefore, ex-combatants should be encouraged to reintegrate&#13;
near their families. In addition, community structures can help them reintegrate both&#13;
socially and economically. Support to communities in which ex-combatants settle can&#13;
encourage acceptance and reinforce social capital.             As much as possible, children&#13;
associated with the armed forces should be reunitedwith their families andhelped to restart&#13;
their education.   Disabled ex-combatants often require special medical and economic&#13;
assistance. Female ex-combatants have had particular difficulty in re-integrating society&#13;
andare inneedo fspecial consideration.&#13;
&#13;
34.     Care should be taken to prevent the stigmatization o f ex-combatants as conveyers o f&#13;
disease and violence. The fears o f communities related to the return o f ex-combatants&#13;
should also be addressed. Community sensitization and information efforts are paramount&#13;
inthis regardas is theprotection allmedicaldata.&#13;
&#13;
35.    Institutional issues. Program coordination by one civilian agency with overall&#13;
program responsibility, balanced by decentralization of implementation to provinces and&#13;
communities makes for a powerful institutional arrangement. Where possible, existing&#13;
implementation capacities should be leveraged. The employment o f some ex-combatants as&#13;
counselors and field staff can facilitate reintegration. Finally, security sector reform must&#13;
be closely coordinatedwith the DDRprogram.&#13;

&#13;
3.1      EligibilityCriteria underthe MDRP&#13;
&#13;
36.      The DRC Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Program is part o f the&#13;
Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program for the greater Great Lakes&#13;
Region. Under the MDRP, the following criteria need to be fulfilled for a country to be&#13;
eligible to receive assistance for the demobilization and reintegration o f ex-combatants:&#13;
&#13;
General criteria:&#13;
&#13;
     -   Affected by conflict. Beinginvolved inor directly affected by one or more o fthe&#13;
&#13;
     -   conflicts inthe greater Great Lakes region.&#13;
         Participation in the regional peaceprocess. Demonstratedwillingness to&#13;
         contribute to stability inthe greater Great Lakes region and to implement relevant&#13;
         provisions o f the applicable peace/ceasefire accord(s).&#13;
&#13;
Country-specific criteria.&#13;
&#13;
         (i)Preparation of a national demobilization and reintegration program. This&#13;
                   would typically be demonstrated by a coherent national program developed&#13;
                   inconsultationwith the international community and national stakeholders.&#13;
                   It could also be demonstrated by having a strategic planning and&#13;
                   consultation process underway, with a clear roadmap andtimetable.&#13;
         (ii)Establishmentof asuitableinstitutionalstructure. Thegovernmentneedsto&#13;
                   establish flexible implementation arrangements with appropriate planning,&#13;
                   coordination and monitoring capacity and with the participation o f relevant&#13;
                   political and security stakeholders.&#13;
         (iii) letter of demobilization policy outlininggovernment commitment. The&#13;
               A&#13;
                   Government drafts a letter outlining its commitments to the regional peace&#13;
                   process, demobilization and reintegration, security sector reform and fiscal&#13;
                   impact o fdemobilization.&#13;
         (iv) Establishment of appropriate safeguards and fiduciary measures.                               The&#13;
                   government would provide assurances and monitoring measures to ensure&#13;
                   consistency with standard environmental and social safeguards. Inaddition,&#13;
                   the government would establish satisfactory financial management and&#13;
                   procurement arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
37.      The Government o f DRC will have fulfilled all general and country-specific criteria&#13;
prior to effectiveness and is therefore eligible under the MDRP objectives to receive&#13;
financial assistance from IDA and the regional MDTF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
' Inthe DRC the term `transition' is used for the set o f activities commonly referred to as `reinsertion', while&#13;
the term `reinsertion' is used for the set of activities commonly referred to as `reintegration'.      The term&#13;
`reintegration' refers to the process o f incorporating the various armed groups into a single army. W e follow&#13;
the standard usage (as in Section 2.3) in this document to avoid confusion.&#13;

&#13;
3.2   Objectives&#13;
&#13;
38.    The general objective o f the Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Program&#13;
(DRCDRP) i s to help consolidate peace and promote economic stability and sustainable&#13;
development in the DRC and inthe greater Great Lakes region. The specific objectives o f&#13;
the program will be:&#13;
&#13;
           (i)    to demobilize up to an estimated 150,000 ex-combatants and to help&#13;
                   support their return to civilian life&#13;
&#13;
           (ii)   to promote the reallocation of Government expenditure from militaryto&#13;
                   social and economic sectors.&#13;
&#13;
39. The DRCDRP is expected to have a significant impact on reducing poverty inthe DRC&#13;
by: establishing more secure conditions inthe rural areas that will encourage the general&#13;
population including IDPs to resume productive lives inthe rural economy; freeing up&#13;
additional national resources for investmentinsocial and economic sectors; and investing&#13;
inthe humancapital ofex-combatants. The DRCDRPwill financemost ofthe&#13;
government's National Program on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reinsertion&#13;
(PNDDR), but will not finance disarmament and expenses o fmilitarypersonnelprior to&#13;
demobilization. Inaddition, some activities inthe PNDDR are already being financed&#13;
through MDRP special projects andwill not be financedunder the DRCDRP.&#13;
&#13;
3.3   Coverageand ImplementationPeriod&#13;
&#13;
40. Targetgroups. The Government envisages approximately 150,000 former combatants&#13;
from the following target groups for the PNDDR:&#13;
&#13;
       (i)     The demobilization andreinsertion o fthe signatories to the Global Accord:&#13;
               FAC, MLC, RCD, RCD-ML, RCD-N, Mayi-Mayi and the Dar-es-Salaam&#13;
               ceasefire;&#13;
       (ii)    Non signatory Armed groups that have taken part inthe conflict, who&#13;
               require DDRand are willing to participate inthe program and respect its&#13;
               conditions;&#13;
       (iii)   Congolese ex-combatants seeking to return from foreign countries;&#13;
       (iv)    Children associated with the fighting forces as defined by the Cape Town&#13;
               principles.&#13;

DRC - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex                    11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
41. Eligibility criteria. The Government has established criteria to verify whether people&#13;
belong to the eligible armed groups and separate eligibility criteria for integration into the&#13;
&#13;
volunteer for demobilization and reinsertionbenefits.&#13;
army. For those who are 1) not eligible for integration1into the army, and 2) those who&#13;
                                                             The following general criteria&#13;
apply:&#13;
&#13;
    (i) Congolesenationality;&#13;
    (ii)     Possession o f a weapon or possession o f a certificate o f disarmament issued by&#13;
             competent authorities, including those issued during spontaneous and voluntary&#13;
             disarmament. The ratio o f combatant/weapon will be determined in the Joint&#13;
             Operations Plan (JOP). The JOP links the activities necessary for the reform o f&#13;
             the army with the activities necessary for demobilization and reintegration.&#13;
    (iii)    Proof o fmembership ina recognized armed group;&#13;
    (iv)     Proof o f having taken part inconflict inDRC between October, 1996 and May,&#13;
             2003.&#13;
&#13;
42. An estimated 150,000 ex-combatants will be demobilized. CONADER, the national&#13;
implementing agency, will coordinate actions with the High Command and MONUC to&#13;
ensure that the criteria are applied systematically andrigorously.&#13;
&#13;
43. Combatants suspected o f crimes against humanity will be excluded from the program&#13;
and their cases will be followed bythe relevant legal authorities.&#13;
&#13;
44. Geographic coverage. The program will cover the whole country, but some areas will&#13;
see a heavier concentration o f ex-combatants than others. Thus, Program benefits would be&#13;
spread throughout the country as well. To facilitate rapid Program start-up while allowing&#13;
time to build capacities in other parts o f the country, reintegration activities would be&#13;
prioritized by province according to the settlement pattern o f ex-combatants, and&#13;
implementation capacities at the provincial and community levels.&#13;
&#13;
Duration. Following the date of effectiveness the Program would be implemented over a&#13;
period o f three years.&#13;
&#13;
45. The Government is also working with its international partners, as well as with&#13;
neighboring Governments, to facilitate the repatriation o f an estimated 15,000 foreign ex-&#13;
combatants. They will be accommodated by their own national DDRprograms.&#13;

    (vi)    Institutional development and Program implementationsupport.&#13;
&#13;
47. The PNDDR and the DRCDRP will be implemented by the National Commission for&#13;
DDR (CONADER) under the supervision o f the Interministerial Committee for DDR&#13;
(CIDDR).&#13;
&#13;
48. The initial stage o f the PNDDR has been conceived to run concurrently with the&#13;
military reform program. As the latter program will review all currently mobilized armed&#13;
forces and potentially demobilize approximately 150,000 o f them, it i s logical for reasons&#13;
o fboth efficiency and security that the two programs share part o f a common process.&#13;
&#13;
49. Logistical arrangements. For security reasons and in order to promote savings and&#13;
efficiency, the `Regroupement', Disarmament and OrientatiodDemobilization exercise will&#13;
be carried out inphases. Each phase will correspond to a specific geographic area. Phases&#13;
within a region will be run consecutively, whereas Phases inregions far apart will be able&#13;
to be run concurrently. Within each DDR phase there will be, depending on the need, a&#13;
number of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 0   Army regroupment sites (mostly barracks)&#13;
 0   Disarmament Points&#13;
 0   OrientatiodDemobilization Centers&#13;
 0   Child Protection Centers&#13;
&#13;
There is also a plan for mobile disarmament and demobilization teams in very remote&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
50. Some o f these centers will be lodged in existing facilities requiring varying degrees o f&#13;
rehabilitation, some will have to be temporary structures constructed for the program. As it&#13;
is planned for each person to spend up to five days in the Orientation Centers, the Centers&#13;
will therefore accommodate up to 1,000 people per week inaddition to the staff..&#13;
&#13;
51. CONADER will require at least 10 provincial offices and some sub offices for&#13;
reinsertion for the duration o f the program (see organigram inAnnex 5).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex                   13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
52. Security Arrangements. A phased approach will be applied to the program, which will&#13;
allow for part o f the armed forces to remain deployed for purposes o f national security, for&#13;
the provision o f security during `regroupment' when disarmament will take place and for&#13;
security at the centers.&#13;
&#13;
Sensitization&#13;
&#13;
53. Prior to the launching o f the actual DDR process, CONADER will commission&#13;
specialized agencies to sensitize both the potential beneficiaries and the communities to&#13;
which they will retum as to the content and implications o f the PNDDR, to manage&#13;
expectations and secure participation in the program. They will also institute specific&#13;
reconciliation activities in communities where the retum o f ex-combatants may cause&#13;
tension or hostility. This sensitization and reconciliation service will continue throughout&#13;
the life o fthe program as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
`Regroupement' and Disarmament.&#13;
&#13;
54. Although this activity is not covered by the project it i s described here to provide a&#13;
complete description o f the national program. The current Unified HighCommand (UHC)&#13;
has instructed that all forces within the current army wishing to be considered for&#13;
integration into the new army must be restructured into formal units for administrative&#13;
purposes and these will be known as units o f `720'. Commanders o f these units will submit&#13;
(under oath) a list of all their combatants and their armament to CONADER prior to the&#13;
DDRexercise.&#13;
&#13;
55. With the implementation o f the program and the start o f the various phases selected&#13;
`720' units will be confined to their barracks. All weapons will be registered and placed in&#13;
a secure place. They will remain the property o f the Congolese Government but be under&#13;
international observation during the DDR period. Each combatant will be given a receipt&#13;
for his weapon.&#13;
&#13;
56. Those irregular combatants, or armed fighting groups, that have not been constituted&#13;
into units of `720' under the Unified High Command, but that also require disarmament&#13;
and potentially demobilization and re-integration, will be invited to present themselves to&#13;
specially designated disarmament points, which will be under the supervision o f&#13;
CONADER. They will disarm, receive a receipt for their weapon and be invited to present&#13;
themselves to the Orientation Center at a specific time.&#13;
&#13;
Orientation and Demobilization&#13;
&#13;
57. All Combatants will come to the Orientation Centers in pre-determined groups,&#13;
unarmed and for those currently with the FA-RDC their military status will be&#13;
"suspended."     On entering, each ex-combatant will be identified and have his status&#13;
verified. Children associated with armed forces will be separated and taken to specialized&#13;
centers. Women will also be separated from the men. All will have a medical visit,&#13;
(including HIV/AIDS sensitization and the possibility o f voluntary testing). Adult ex-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex                  14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
combatants will then be briefed on the eligibility criteria, conditions for entering the army&#13;
and the demobilization program andreinsertion benefits.&#13;
&#13;
58. Those that wish to join the new army and that meet the eligibility criteria will&#13;
immediately leave for a military location. There they will undergo further evaluation (at the&#13;
expense o f the MOD). Ifthey should fail to meet the requirements o f the security service,&#13;
they will again become eligible for consideration for demobilization and reinsertion. A time&#13;
frame and the process will be determined inthe joint operations plan.&#13;
&#13;
59. Those wishing to enter the demobilization and reinsertion process and meeting the&#13;
criteria, will continue on to the demobilization activities. These will include: formal&#13;
demobilization from the armed services; a formal acceptance o f the terms o f the program,&#13;
the collection o f socio-economic data; further orientation on the program; and civic&#13;
training.&#13;
&#13;
Identification and Verification&#13;
&#13;
60. CONADER will supervise and coordinate the verification o f the status o f each&#13;
combatant. This may require a special verification panel. The panel's main role will be a)&#13;
to establish whether the individual i s a combatant either eligible for demobilization and re-&#13;
integration as defined by the PNDDR or for integration into the new army; and b) to&#13;
establish if the individual is a child soldier as defined by the Cape Town Principles. Those&#13;
not meeting either set o f criteria will be tumed away. Human rights personnel may also&#13;
intervene at this stage to identifysuspected perpetrators o f crimes against humanity.&#13;
&#13;
Services provided during Orientation and Demobilization.&#13;
&#13;
61. Medical Screening: A special medical team will screen the combatants to identify&#13;
serious diseases or impairments that may affect economic and social reintegration or re-&#13;
incorporation into the security forces. Voluntary counseling and testing for HIV/AIDS will&#13;
be offered. To this end, medical teams will be established and will comprise members with&#13;
skills relevant to HIV/AIDS and the special needs o f women and children. All medical&#13;
information will be kept confidential.&#13;
&#13;
62. Socio-economic profiling:         A simplified socio-economic questionnaire will be&#13;
completed by CONADER for all demobilizing ex-combatants during the demobilization&#13;
process. Data collected during the exercise will contain information about ex-combatants'&#13;
demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, number o f children, etc.),&#13;
education, assistance needs and aspirations. The data will be incorporated into the M I S to&#13;
be administered by CONADER and will be used to inform the development o f&#13;
reintegration assistance strategies.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex                 15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
63. Pre-discharge orientation:         Pre-discharge orientation (PDO) will provide ex-&#13;
combatants and, where applicable their partners, with essential information. The orientation&#13;
program will be put in place by CONADER, which will also identify and train counselors&#13;
and prepare appropriate materials.       The PDO will provide accurate information about&#13;
programbenefits and minimize unrealistic expectations. Specific PDO topics include:&#13;
&#13;
     (i)    DemobilizationID card (non-negotiable, non-transferable);&#13;
     (ii)   Program benefits and payment procedures;&#13;
     (iii) Programopportunities;&#13;
     (iv)   The role o fthe CONADER's provincial offices;&#13;
     (v)    HIV/AIDS prevention and control; and&#13;
     (vi)   Civic duties andhuman rights.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
64. Demobilization cards: A proper identification system is essential to ensure target&#13;
group integrity during program implementation.              Each ex-combatant will receive a&#13;
demobilization program IDcard from CONADER. These will include photographs andbe&#13;
individually numbered and stamped. They will not vary by ex-combatant group. All ID&#13;
card information will be incorporated into the Management Information System (MIS).&#13;
&#13;
65. Provisions for special target groups: Children associated with the armed forces:&#13;
while awaiting transfer to Transit Centers they will be separated and accommodated in&#13;
areas managed by the child protection agencies. These agencies will reunify them with&#13;
their families or place them in alternative care. Dependents: Although families o f ex-&#13;
combatants are not direct beneficiaries under the PNDDR, the family unit o f an ex-&#13;
combatant will be taken into consideration during the planning and implementation o f the&#13;
different phases o f the program. CONADER will work in close consultation and&#13;
coordination with relevant Ministries on all issues inrelation to accompanying families.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reinsertion&#13;
&#13;
66. Upondischarge from the Orientation Centers, demobilized combatants lose their source&#13;
o f income and their right to army accommodation. Transitional safety net assistance will&#13;
therefore be provided to support ex-combatants for a limited period following their return&#13;
to civilian life('transition ' phase). It will consist o f a Basic Needs Kit (Kit de premiere&#13;
nkcessitk) to assist in the actual retum to home and the first part o f a Transitional&#13;
Subsistence Allowance (TSA) to sustain the ex-combatant and his or her family until they&#13;
have had a chance to register for the reintegrationprogram intheir area.&#13;
&#13;
67. The BNK would provide the following assistance to facilitate the initial transition to&#13;
civilian life o f ex-combatants: (i)transport and food allowance, most probably in the form&#13;
o f a $30 cash grant; (ii) basic household items kit; The BNK would be provided to all ex-&#13;
combatants upon their departure from the demobilization centers. Transport allowances&#13;
will not be given to children as they will be transferred by child protection agencies to&#13;
Transit Centers for children. Vulnerable cases such as handicapped and chronically illmay&#13;
qualify for special transport assistance.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project - TechnicalAnnex                     16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
68. Transitional Subsistence Allowance: This assistance is provided incash. Each adult ex-&#13;
combatant will receive $50 on departure from the Orientation centers the first installment&#13;
o f the TSA.&#13;
&#13;
Reintegration&#13;
&#13;
69. The second and third installments o f the TSA will be paid once the ex-combatant&#13;
registers inhisher chosen area o f reintegration. Upon registration at the provincial offices&#13;
the ex-combatant will receive a cash payment o f U S $150. This will be followed a number&#13;
o f months later by a second payment o f U S $150, if the ex-combatants continue&#13;
participating in program activities and are starting to reintegrate in their communities. The&#13;
offices will be responsible for the registration o f the ex-combatant for TSA as well as for&#13;
the socio-economic reintegration.&#13;
&#13;
70. Assistance will be provided to help ex-combatants reintegrate themselves into their&#13;
communities and establish sustainable livelihoods. The following guiding principles will&#13;
apply for reintegration assistance: (a) minimize market distortions and maximize&#13;
beneficiary choice; (b) provide assistance that leads to sustainable livelihoods, (c) involve&#13;
communities o f settlement and foster reconciliation, (d) to the extent possible, benefit the&#13;
wider community&#13;
&#13;
71. Economic reintegration. Ex-combatants should be offered assistance in attaining&#13;
sustainable livelihoods. They should be equally eligible for the program irrespective o f&#13;
rank or former military affiliation or gender and they should be allowed to choose their&#13;
reintegration destination freely. In principle, the programs should give preference to&#13;
reintegration assistance that also benefits the ex-combatant's community o f return. To the&#13;
extent possible, reintegration support should build on existing capacities rather than create&#13;
new structures. Assistance will be offered in different forms: provision o f information,&#13;
counseling and referral services; vocational training, formal and informal apprenticeship&#13;
schemes and educational opportunities; employment. It is anticipated that with the&#13;
restoration o f peace many labor intensive programs and other employment opportunities&#13;
will be generated by public and private rehabilitation, development and investment&#13;
initiatives. The Bank is itself supporting substantial government commissioned&#13;
infrastructure programs throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
72. Social reintegration. Social reintegration is essential for a sustainable return to civilian&#13;
life and livelihoods. Social reintegration may be especially difficult in areas where ex-&#13;
combatants lost their families or where the social fabric has been destroyed. Community&#13;
participation inthe PNDDRi s therefore considered critical for successful reintegration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Special target groups&#13;
&#13;
73. Gender. The PNDDR will provide targeted support for the social and economic&#13;
reintegration o f female ex-combatants. Women "associated with the fighting forces" may&#13;
constitute a sizeable group that from previous experience warrants particular attention.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and ReintegrationProject - TechnicalAnnex                                       17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Often sexually abused they are not only traumatized but often stigmatized and require&#13;
specializedre-integration support. Specific measures would include the following:&#13;
&#13;
                   (i)Ensuringthatthespecialneeds(e.g., security,sanitation)offemaleex-&#13;
                   combatants are taken into account inthe orientation centers;&#13;
                   (ii)ensuringthatallbenefitsforex-combatantsareequalforandequally&#13;
                   accessible to menand women;&#13;
                   (iii)encouragingfemaleex-combatantstoparticipateinexistingwomen's&#13;
                   associations;&#13;
                   (iv) including partners o fex-combatants andwomen incommunities o f&#13;
                   return incommunity-level counseling activities;&#13;
                   (v) strengthening the gender awareness and capacity o f CONADER staff&#13;
                   and o f others involved inthe reintegration process; and&#13;
                   (vi) monitoring the impact o fthe Programonpartners o fex-combatants and&#13;
                   women incommunities o freturn and bringing emerging problems to the&#13;
                   attention o f the relevant authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
74. Disabled ex-combatants.2Only limited medical and economic assistance has been&#13;
provided to disabled ex-combatants to date. The PNDDR would seek to systematically&#13;
address the medical and economic rehabilitation needs o f the estimated 2,000 disabled ex-&#13;
combatants to be demobilized under the Program. A medical commission would define the&#13;
degree of disability. With respect to physical rehabilitation, the Program would provide&#13;
assistance depending on the degree o f disability.&#13;
&#13;
75. Chronicallyillex-combatants.The Program would also seek to systematically address&#13;
the medical needs o f chronically ill ex-combatants. A medical commission would&#13;
determine the degree o f illness. The Program would endeavor to ensure access to medical&#13;
care and counseling for chronically ill ex-combatants for up to 12 months after&#13;
demobilization. After this period, the Program would transfer responsibility for these ex-&#13;
combatants to relevant health authorities.&#13;
&#13;
76. Children associated with the armed forces. Child ex-combatants are estimated to&#13;
represent at least 10% to 20% o f the fighting forces. They will need priority assistance.&#13;
CONADER will work in coordination with partners specialized in the area o f child&#13;
protection. The children associated with the armed forces program has been established by&#13;
experts and based on current best practice. The guidingprinciple is to secure the release3 o f&#13;
all children associated with the fighting forces and to promote their earliest re-unification&#13;
with their families or placement inalternative care.&#13;
&#13;
77. Children associated with the armed forces will be separated from the adults and the&#13;
mainstream DDR program as soon as presented to the program. They will be taken to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Disability is defined as the functional limitation within an individual caused by physical, mental or sensory&#13;
'impairmentare&#13;
  Children      "released" from the fighting forces and do not require `legal' demobilization.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex                   18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
dedicated transit and orientation centers (TOC) for children where experts will assess their&#13;
needs and define the best approach for re-integrating the child into society. The children&#13;
will require special assistance especially inthe areas o fpsychological support, drug abuse,&#13;
sexual abuse, child mothers, etc., but the ultimate goal i s to return the child to his or her&#13;
family or to place them in an alternative family setting --TOO are not to become&#13;
permanent orphanages. Tracing services will endeavor to find the child's family. However,&#13;
ifthese cannot be found, extended familymembers or appropriate alternative care such as&#13;
foster families, independent living, or group homes will be sought. Assistance will include&#13;
family tracing and reunification, trauma counseling and psychosocial care, and facilitation&#13;
o f access to education or skills training in communities o f settlement. While CONADER&#13;
would coordinate general assistance to children associated with the armed forces,&#13;
implementation would be undertaken by organizations experienced in this area. Several&#13;
pilot activities are currently being funded through the MDRP Special Project window.&#13;
These provide the basis for the nationalprogram.&#13;
&#13;
78. HIV/AIDS. Previous experience has demonstrated that combatants are a high-risk&#13;
group for HIV infection. The project would offer an extensive HIV/AIDS service to the ex-&#13;
combatants. The PNDDR itself will provide the necessary counseling to all combatants in&#13;
the Orientation centers inorder to allow them to make an informed decision as to voluntary&#13;
testing. On-site testing will be made available, as will any post-testing counseling that is&#13;
required. PNDDR will only be able to provide treatment for acute opportunistic infections&#13;
but will direct patients towards available HIV/AIDS programs. The MAP program inDRC&#13;
has recently been launched and it is hoped that it will provide an increasing number o f&#13;
treatment opportunities to which ex-combatants canbe referred.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.5   Program Costs&#13;
&#13;
79.The Government's Program i s estimated to cost US$ 200 million (see Table l),f           o&#13;
which IDAwould finance US$$lOOmillion. MDRPis financing an additional $100 million&#13;
o f the program and $18 million through special projects. Total Program costs per&#13;
beneficiary are roughly $1228.&#13;

80. Government counterpart contribution. Notwithstanding its fiscal constraints, the&#13;
Government is committed to supporting the Program. In this spirit, Government would&#13;
waive all taxes leviedinDRC on works, goods and services for this Program. It would also&#13;
contribute land, office space, security and other in-kindsupport.&#13;

4     Studies and Technical Assistance&#13;
&#13;
82. A number o f studies have been identified to support the development and&#13;
implementation o f the program. Some o f these studies are being financed under the PPF&#13;
and others will be carried out through MDRP supported special projects or through&#13;
additional technical support provided by the World Bank. Technical assistance may also&#13;
be provided directly to CONADER by the World Bank, MDRP, and bilateral donors and&#13;
through MDRP supported special projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.1    Studies&#13;
&#13;
83. Economic Opportunity Inventory. The objective o f this study would be to establish an&#13;
inventory o f reintegration opportunities (training, employment, development projects, etc.)&#13;
by province and sector. This inventory would be used by the PPOs for informing and&#13;
sensitizing ex-combatants&#13;
&#13;
84. Pre-demobilization orientation program. A program would be developedto provide ex-&#13;
combatants with information about the Program, health issues andcivilian life. In&#13;
particular, ex-combatants would be briefed about their benefits andthe modalities of&#13;
accessing them, banking and financial matters, civic and community duties, training and&#13;
employment opportunities, access to land and credit, income generating activities, and&#13;
family andhealth issues.&#13;
&#13;
85. Program of community sensitization and participation. The objective o f this program&#13;
would be to sensitize the civilian population about the PNDDR and the challenges faced&#13;
during this process by ex-combatants and their families. The program would also address&#13;
the concerns of the receiving communities and encourage their participation in&#13;
reintegration activities. The program would be disseminated in various forms o f media&#13;
(e.g., radio, brochures, popular folk theater, andnewspapers).&#13;
&#13;
86. Assistancefor disabled ex-combatants. This study would help design andcost the&#13;
detailed assistance package to: (i) provide counseling necessary for the social reintegration&#13;
o f disabled ex-combatants; (ii) physical rehabilitation o f disabled ex-combatants to achieve&#13;
optimal and sustainable benefits from therapeutic interventions such as the provision o f&#13;
prostheses and physiotherapy; and (iii)where relevant, train disabled ex-combatants in&#13;
skills needed to pursue an economic activity which is both o f their choice and economically&#13;
viable. The assistance would encourage the development o f community-based rather than&#13;
institution-based services, and would further initiatives which increase the capacity o f&#13;
disabled people to help themselves and each other.&#13;
&#13;
87. Management Information System (Data Base).              The system will manage all data&#13;
relating to monitoring and evaluation and will include : socio-economic date, identification&#13;
system for ex-combatants and other beneficiaries, and links to the financial management&#13;
system.&#13;

will identify critical needs related to gender and propose specific actions to ensure that&#13;
women and men both play a role in the socio-economic reintegration o f ex-combatants in&#13;
their communities.&#13;
&#13;
89. Identijkation of training resourcesfor reintegration. This study will provide a map o f&#13;
available training capacity related to reintegration, define activities and put in place a&#13;
network o f partners, community associations, national and internationalNGOs, and private,&#13;
public and parastatal organizations working on capacity building.&#13;
&#13;
90. Financial management system. Design of an FMS, including a manual o f financial and&#13;
procurement procedures.&#13;
&#13;
91.Development of an implementation manual. The objective o f the PIM is to describe&#13;
how the various components o f the program will be implemented, monitored and&#13;
evaluated. This activity will include a review o f program documents and a summary o f the&#13;
program; a brief description o f the program components and activities, and o f Government&#13;
policy on demobilization and reintegration; an implementation framework; a table o f&#13;
activities, resource requirements, implementation time frame, implementing office(s), and&#13;
beneficiaries under consideration;        implementation arrangements       related to   fund&#13;
administration;    a procurement plan;         guidelines   and operational procedures o f&#13;
demobilization, reintegration, social and economic reintegration; vulnerability guidelines;&#13;
organizational structures and terms o freference for program staff.&#13;
&#13;
92. Identification of questions related to children associated with the armedforces. The&#13;
study will consolidate the lessons learned inpilot activities on child soldier demobilization&#13;
and define procedures for continuing these activities.&#13;
&#13;
93. Identification of issues linked to HIV/AIDS. The study will formulate recommendations&#13;
on the type o f interventions relative to H N / A I D S to be undertaken by the demobilization&#13;
program, outline the implementation procedures and propose a budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.2    TechnicalAssistance&#13;
&#13;
94. Local and/or expatriate technical assistance may be required for long-term and short-&#13;
term assignments duringProgram implementation. Consultancies will be required on an&#13;
ongoing basis, especially for the design and the implementation o f the manual o f&#13;
procedures and the training o f the FMstaff and for periodic external technical and&#13;
financial audits and independent evaluations. Where not covered under the MDRPspecial&#13;
projects or through other agreed bilateral technical support, qualified (private and/or&#13;
public) providers would be contracted by CONADER to undertake such activities.&#13;
Targeted technical assistance may also be needed for HIV/AIDS activities and the special&#13;
target groups component. CONADER will sub-contract activities inpart or as a whole to&#13;
qualified implementers.&#13;

5   InstitutionalArrangements andProgramImplementation&#13;
95. The institutional structure for the Program was established on December 18, 2003 by&#13;
decree (03/041, 03/042, 03/043). It consists o f three primary institutions.&#13;
&#13;
96. The Interministerial Committee on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration&#13;
(CIDDR). This committee will provide oversight on the PNDDR. Its responsibilities&#13;
include the following:&#13;
&#13;
    (i)     determining Government policy for the demobilization and reinsertion o f ex-&#13;
            combatants;&#13;
    (ii)    monitoring and guidingthe implementation o f the PNDDR;&#13;
    (iii)   providing strategic and policy-level Program coordination.&#13;
    (iv)    ensuring coordination o f policy between DDR and Security Sector Reform&#13;
            (SSR)&#13;
&#13;
97. The National Commission on DDR (CONADER). CONADER will implement the&#13;
program including:&#13;
&#13;
    (i)     the preparation and costing o f detailed annual implementation plans;&#13;
&#13;
    (ii)    the implementation and coordination o f the individual PNDDR components&#13;
            (demobilization, reinsertion, reintegration, special target groups, HIV/AIDS&#13;
            measures). To this end, CONADER would establish close links with relevant&#13;
            Government departments, local organizations and associations, and the private&#13;
            sector;&#13;
&#13;
    (iii)   monitoring and evaluation o f implementation progress and impacts; and&#13;
&#13;
    (iv)    ensuring the coordination o f international partners in accordance with the needs&#13;
            o f the program and the principles o f the MDRP&#13;
&#13;
98. Comite de Gestion des Fond DDR (CGFDR):              The Committee to manage funds for&#13;
DDR is responsible for the transparent and accountable administration o f Program&#13;
resources (including procurement and financial management).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
99. Links between the three institutions will be further detailed in the implementation&#13;
manual. The FM arrangements should be adapted to the relations put inplace between the&#13;
three institutions interm o fresponsibility, reporting and control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NationalLevel&#13;
&#13;
100.    CONADER will consist o f 5 departments (see organigrain Annex 5) :&#13;
&#13;
                 (i) DisarmamentandDemobilization&#13;
                 (ii) Reinsertion&#13;
                 (iii) AdministrationandFinance&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
D R C - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex                23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 (iv)    Children Associated with Armed Groups&#13;
                 (v)     Information and sensitization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
101.     The implementation mechanisms for the DDR component are outlined in the PNDDR and&#13;
detailed in the Joint Operations Plan for DDR. The management o f the DDR program will come&#13;
under a specialized unit o f CONADER, which will carry overall responsibility for all aspects of&#13;
the DDR process. It should be noted, however, that the regroupment and disarmament exercise,&#13;
though planned and overseen by members o f the CONADER and monitored by MONUC, will&#13;
actually be carried out and largely funded by the M O D and not by the DRCDRP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Regional Level&#13;
&#13;
102.     Due to the size o f the country and the probability that ex-combatants will returnto&#13;
all provinces, CONADER will establish a Provincial Program Office (PPO) in each&#13;
province to administer reinsertion assistance, and to monitor and evaluate program&#13;
implementation progress and impacts.&#13;
&#13;
103.     The PPOs will report to CONADER and be attached to the offices o f the provincial&#13;
administration to ensure the integration o f Program implementation in the Government's&#13;
provincial structures.&#13;
&#13;
104.     The CONADER Provincial Program Offices would be responsible for the&#13;
following:&#13;
&#13;
             (i)updatingtheinventoryofprojectsandtrainingandemploymentproviders;&#13;
             (ii)conducting outreach activities with ex-combatants, including counseling and&#13;
                 referral as well as business development support;&#13;
             (iii)managingthe work o f district ex-combatant outreach personnel;&#13;
             (iv) technical and financial monitoring o freintegration activities;&#13;
             (v) coordinating with other Government and non-governmental institutions and&#13;
                 reconstruction activities; and&#13;
             (vi) reportingto CONADER on a regular basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.1     Staffing, institutional support and capacity building&#13;
&#13;
105.     The institutional structure for Program implementation will be new and will require&#13;
strengthening at all levels. Staff recruited for these positions should have experience and&#13;
qualifications satisfactory to IDA. Provincial staff would be recruited in accordance with&#13;
the settlement patterns o f ex-combatants. Qualified ex-combatants could fill these&#13;
positions.&#13;
&#13;
 106.    Equipment would be provided to help each office ftilfill its responsibilities&#13;
effectively. For CONADER this would include vehicles and office equipment. Each&#13;
Provincial Program Office would receive essential office equipment as well as motorcycles&#13;
for monitoring and outreach activities.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project - TechnicalAnnex                        24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
107.     Staff development at the central and provincial levels would be critical for effective&#13;
Program implementation. Staff at all levels would undergo necessary training. The&#13;
objectives o f this training, which would commence immediately after staff have been&#13;
recruited/assigned, would be to ensure that all involved in the PNDDR have the same&#13;
understanding o f the Program objectives, procedures, and specific responsibilities,&#13;
including their tasks in relation to the internal reporting system. A staff development&#13;
program would be prepared and would include: (i)           the preparation o f a training plan; (ii)&#13;
the development o f training materials; and (iii)the carrying out o f training activities,&#13;
including gender awareness and sensitization, conflict resolution and reconciliation. Staff&#13;
selection and training would include measures to enhance the ability o f CONADER&#13;
personnel to provide assistance in an equitable manner irrespective o f the former military&#13;
affiliation o f beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.2    FinancialManagement,DisbursementsandAuditing&#13;
&#13;
108.     The overall coordination o f the fiduciary aspects o f the Program would be under the&#13;
responsibility of the CONADER. All funds would be managed by the CGFDR with&#13;
technical guidance by an independent accounting firm recruited prior to project&#13;
effectiveness. PPOs would not be involved infunds management, though petty cash would&#13;
bemade available to cover minor expenses within established limits.&#13;
&#13;
109.     The principal objective o f the Program's financial management system (FMS)&#13;
would be to support management in the distribution o f limited resources with the purpose&#13;
o f ensuring economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery o f outputs required to&#13;
achieve program objectives. Specifically, the FMS must be capable o f producing timely,&#13;
understandable, relevant and reliable financial information that would enable management&#13;
to plan, implement, monitor and appraise the Project's overall progress towards the&#13;
achievement o f its objectives.&#13;
&#13;
110.     Qualified, experienced and independent external auditors would be appointed on&#13;
approved terms o f reference. Regular financial and technical external audits will be carried&#13;
out due to the complexity the risk and the need for monitoring the performances o f the&#13;
program. The external audits would cover all World Bank, other donors and Counterpart&#13;
funds at all levels o f Program execution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DisbursementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
Financing Mechanisms&#13;
&#13;
111.     Retroactive financing. To facilitate speedy support to ex-combatants demobilized&#13;
prior to project effectiveness, the Project would allow retroactive financing in the amount&#13;
o f US$20 million (20% o f the IDA grant amount). Retroactive financing would allow the&#13;
Government to initiate large-scale demobilization activities as soon as possible.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization ana' Reintegration Project - Technical Annex                 25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Multi-donor trustfund. The Government recognizes that the MDRP trust fund would help&#13;
to ensure comprehensive financing for the Program, facilitate the involvement o f donors&#13;
that might otherwise not be able to participate, minimize duplication o f efforts, and reduce&#13;
the administrative burden on Government through the application o f one set o f&#13;
implementation procedures. Government will thus apply to the MDTF o f the MDRP to&#13;
finance the part o f the program not financed by IDA or by bilateral partners.           IDA&#13;
financing is made under the assumption that MDRP financing will be approved. Problems&#13;
with the approval of MDRP funding for the DRCDRP may lead to suspension o f IDA&#13;
financing.&#13;
112.   Direct Cash Payments to Ex-Combatants. Cash payments to ex-combatants are a&#13;
standard feature o f transitional safety nets inDDRprograms. Inorder to improve the&#13;
financial management o f these payments and ensure the timely availability o f funds, this&#13;
project will make these payments directly from IDA funds. This requires a partial waiver o f&#13;
OP 2.30 because some o fthe cash maybe used for purchasingfood and other items that&#13;
mightbe construed as humanitarian assistance. To facilitate financial monitoring, the&#13;
project will put inplace a dedicated special account to be usedonly for processingthese&#13;
payments. Funds will be disbursed from the Special Account through a financial firm hired&#13;
to manage the cash payments. Eligible ex-combatants would be requiredto appear for&#13;
payments at specified times and locations with their IDcards. Payments would be initiated&#13;
and authorized at the Central level by CONADER. The transitional subsistence allowances&#13;
(TSAs) will be handed to ex-combatants at the respective CONADER demobilization&#13;
centers over the territory.&#13;
&#13;
113.    The followingbank accounts would be maintainedby CONADER for program&#13;
funds:&#13;
e       IDA Grant Special Account A: (denominated inU S dollars), program funds would&#13;
        be deposited from the IDA Grant for cash payments to eligible ex-combatants;&#13;
e       IDA Grant Special Account B: (denominatedinU S dollars), program funds would&#13;
        be deposited from the IDA Grant for all other eligible expenses.&#13;
e       MDTF Special Account: (denominated inUS dollars), program fimds would be&#13;
        deposited from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund(MDTF).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
114.    The IDA Grant Special Accounts and the MDTF Special Account would be&#13;
maintained ina commercialbank acceptable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
Use of Statementsof Expenditures(SOEs)&#13;
&#13;
115.    Disbursements for all expenditures will be made against full documentation except&#13;
for items of expenditures under: (a) contracts for consulting firms inamount inferior to&#13;
US$ 100,000 equivalent; (b) contracts for individual consultants in an amount inferior to&#13;
US$ 50,000 equivalent; (c) contracts for works in an amount inferior to US$200,000; and&#13;
(d) contracts for goods inan amount inferior to US$ 100,000; (e) cash payments, training&#13;
and operating costs, which will be claimed on the basis o f statements o f expenditures&#13;
(SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained at CONADER and the&#13;

IDA supervisionmissions and extemal auditors.&#13;
&#13;
SpecialAcccounts&#13;
&#13;
116.   To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume o f withdrawal&#13;
applications, CONADERwill open two Special Accounts inU S dollars ina commercial&#13;
bank acceptable to IDA. Special Account A will finance cash payments to ex-combatants&#13;
underthe contract signed with a financial firm, while Special Account Bwill finance all&#13;
other project expenditures. The authorized Special allocations will be US$3 million for&#13;
Special Account A and US$4m for Special Account B and will cover approximately four&#13;
(4) months o f expenditures. Uponcredit effectiveness IDA will deposit the amount o fUS$&#13;
1.5 million into Special Account A and 3 million into Special Account B representing50&#13;
percent o fthe authorized allocation.&#13;
&#13;
117.    The remainingbalance will be made available when the aggregate amount o f&#13;
withdrawals from the Credit account plus the total amount o f all outstanding special&#13;
commitments entered into by the Association shall be equal or exceed the equivalent of&#13;
SDR 2 million for Special Account A and SDR 20,500,OO for Special Account B. The&#13;
Special Accounts will be used for all payments inferior to 20 percent o f the authorized&#13;
allocation and replenishment applications will be submittedmonthly. Further deposits by&#13;
IDAinto the Special Account will bemade against withdrawal applications supported by&#13;
appropriate documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
AccountingandFinancialReportingArrangements&#13;
&#13;
The AccountingFirm&#13;
&#13;
118.    An internationally recognized accounting firm will be recruited on a short-term&#13;
contract (12 to 18 months) to provide technical assistance to the FM team o f CONADER&#13;
and CFGDR including (i)     developing a manual of administrative, financial and accounting&#13;
procedures, (ii)assisting in implementing a sound computerized financial management&#13;
system (budgeting, accounting system, financial reporting) at the central and regional levels&#13;
and (iii)training the staff. This firm would provide support to the project until such time as&#13;
IDA'Sfinancial management staff certify that CFGDR has sufficient capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Administrative, FinancialandAccountingProceduresManual&#13;
&#13;
119.    The accounting systems, policies and procedures employed by the program in&#13;
accounting and managing for the program funds will b e documented in the project's&#13;
Financial and Accounting Procedures Manual (FAPM). This will be used by: staff as a&#13;
reference manual; IDA and other donors to assess the acceptability o f the project&#13;
accounting, reporting and control systems; and by the auditors to assess project accounting&#13;
systems and controls and in designing specific project audit procedures.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Integrated Financial Management System&#13;
&#13;
120.   For the Program to deliver on its objectives, a Financial Management System would&#13;
be developed. A financial management action plan has been designed to achieve this prior&#13;
to project effectiveness (see below). The system should integrate budgeting, operating and&#13;
accounting systems to facilitate monitoring and reporting. System generated formats for&#13;
periodic reports would be developed and agreedwith program management.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs)&#13;
&#13;
121.   Project management staff should be able to produce FMRs by effectiveness. The&#13;
report would be prepared on a quarterly basis in accordance with the Guidelines for&#13;
Borrowers on Financial Monitoring Reports and would include the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Sources and Uses o f Fundsby Grant Categories and Program Components&#13;

&#13;
Financial Statements&#13;
&#13;
122.   Incompliance with International Accounting Standards and IDA requirements, the&#13;
project would produce biannual financial statements. Financial Statements would include:&#13;
&#13;
       A Statement o f Cash Receipts and Payments which recognizes all cash receipts,&#13;
       cash payments and cash balances controlled by the project.&#13;
       A Balance Sheet that shows Assets and Liabilities.&#13;
    0  A Statement of Sources and Uses ofFunds.&#13;

&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
External Financial Auditing&#13;
&#13;
123.    Qualified independent auditors would be appointed by the CONADER. The&#13;
selected auditors would be acceptable to IDA in terms o f independence, qualifications and&#13;
experience. The audit would be based on terms o f reference agreed with IDA. The external&#13;
audit work would include all World Bank funds, other funds and Government funds (if&#13;
available) for the program.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
D R C - Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex                  28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
124.     The financial statements o f the Programwould be audited every six months (at least&#13;
for the two first years o f the program) untilperformance i s proved to be satisfactory, and&#13;
annually thereafter. The date o f the first audit would be determined in consultation with&#13;
IDA. The first audit would include the period o fthe PPF.&#13;
&#13;
125.     In addition to the audit report, the auditor would be required to prepare a&#13;
Management Letter where internal control weaknesses and recommendations for&#13;
improvements, are highlighted. A single audit opinion would be issued on program income&#13;
and expenditures, special accounts and statements o f expenditure. Another audit opinion&#13;
will be issued on specific controls such as compliance with procurement procedures and&#13;
FMR requirements and the terms o f the grant agreements. The audit reports along with&#13;
Management Letters would be sent to IDA and all other financing partners not later than&#13;
four months after the end o f eachpreceding period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
126. For the sake o f comprehensiveness and harmonization o f procedures, Program&#13;
funds would be administered and audited irrespective o f their source and the financing&#13;
mechanism employed.&#13;
&#13;
Extemal Technical Auditing&#13;
&#13;
127.     A firm of technical auditors will be contracted competitively to assess the&#13;
performance o f the program and to review procurement, statements o f expenditures, as well&#13;
as verifying the physical existence o f goods, equipment, and services acquired through the&#13;
program. This audit will be conducted on a quarterly basis for the first two quarters and&#13;

Financial Supervision&#13;
&#13;
128.   The World Bank would do financial Management Supervision over the program life&#13;
to ensure the implementation o f strong financial management systems. Statement o f&#13;
Expenditure (SOE) reviews would be undertaken where necessary in compliance with&#13;
World Bank requirements.&#13;
&#13;
129.    On a semi-annual basis or at such time as the Government and the Bank deem&#13;
necessary, the Government and IDA would carry out joint supervision missions. These&#13;
missions would make spot checks on a small random sample o f beneficiaries at their place&#13;
o fresidence to verify the use of the funds disbursed.&#13;
&#13;
130.    The Project Status Report (PSR) will include a financial management rating for the&#13;
component done by the Country Office Financial Management Specialist after an&#13;
appropriate review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RiskAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
131.    In order to establish an acceptable control environment and to mitigate financial&#13;
management risks, the measures outlined in the Action Plan (above) should be&#13;
implemented. The Program i s high risk until the FMS and other operational systems are&#13;
well defined and documented, andpersonnel are trained.&#13;
&#13;
132.    Safeguards to ensure the proper use of funds. Six safeguards have been built into&#13;
the Program to ensure that IDA f k d s are utilized for the purposes intended:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                Periodic audits would verify appropriate use o f funds under all Categories;&#13;
            0   A unique, non-transferable, photograph ID would be provided to each ex-&#13;
                combatant. This would be used to verify ex-combatants' eligibility for&#13;
                assistance;&#13;
            0   The IDSwould be entered in an integrated MIS that would enable&#13;
                CONADER and            Provincial     Program       Officesto   track    Program&#13;
                implementation at the central and local level;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
             0  Annual surveys o f a representative sample o f the beneficiary population&#13;
                would track Program delivery and verify their receipt o f assistance; and&#13;
             0  IDA would carry out semi-annual supervisionmissions incollaborationwith&#13;
                interested UN/donor partners.&#13;
&#13;
133.   Overall assessment. A Bank accredited Financial Management Specialist has&#13;
reviewed the present status and the agreed actions indicated in the Financial Management&#13;
Action Plan above. On this basis, IDA has reasonable assurances for satisfactory financial&#13;
management o f Program funds inconformity with current IDA requirements. The financial&#13;
management o f the PNDDR would require close follow up. To this end, specialized Bank&#13;
staff would monitor financial management performance on an ongoing basis.&#13;
&#13;
5.3   Procurement&#13;
&#13;
134.   Procurement o f goods and works to be financed from the proceeds o f the Grant&#13;
would be govemed by the Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits&#13;
published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and&#13;
January 1999. Consultant services contracts financed by IDA would be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers published inJanuary 1997 andrevised inSeptember 1997 and January 1999 and&#13;
May 2002.&#13;
&#13;
135.   The Grant would finance goods required for the demobilization process, including&#13;
basic needs kits, equipment to prepare ID cards. The Grant would also finance office&#13;
equipment and vehicles/motorcycles for the CONADER and the PPOs, as well as the&#13;
rehabilitation of, and the purchase o f essential equipment.&#13;
&#13;
Procurementcapacityassessment andimplementationarrangements&#13;
&#13;
136.   Procurement activities would be handled by CONADER, via the CGFDR,&#13;
including: (i) preparation o f the General Procurement Notice and its annual update; (ii)&#13;
preparation o f the specific procurement notices; (iii)       preparation and update o f the six&#13;
monthly procurement plan; (iv) drafting bidding documents and request o f proposals; (v)&#13;
awarding o f contracts and requesting for IDA no-objections when required; and (vi)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
137.     CONADER is a new institution with limited procurement experience. As a result,&#13;
the project is considered highrisk.While the procurement program financed by the Grant i s&#13;
not extensive, the fact that the upfront delivery o f some goods and the completion o f&#13;
rehabilitation o f some works would be critical to the success o f the Program, means that the&#13;
CONADER needs to be guided and assisted in order to fulfill its responsibilities&#13;
satisfactorily. Consequently, the following measures were agreed: (i)            recruitment o f an&#13;
international procurement consultant to assist the CONADER to prepare the detailed&#13;
procurement plan for the first six months o f operation, the bidding documents for the first&#13;
six months and provide on-the-job training to the national procurement officer; (ii)&#13;
recruiting a consultant to prepare the Program implementation manual (PIM); (iii)&#13;
recruiting the national procurement officer before Grant Effectiveness. These activities&#13;
would be financed under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF). The adoption o f a PTM&#13;
satisfactory to IDA would be a condition o f Grant effectiveness. The consultant to prepare&#13;
the manual has been identified and the PIM should be available by the end M a y 2004.&#13;
&#13;
Procurementplan&#13;
&#13;
138.     CONADER would prepare the procurement planfor the first six months o f&#13;
operationbefore Grant effectiveness. It would update the plan every six months for&#13;
discussion with the Bank during supervision missions. Regular FinancialMonitoring&#13;
Reports would present procurement activities inan appropriate degree o f detail.&#13;
&#13;

138.     Contracts for goods estimated to cost US$ 200,000 equivalent or more, may be&#13;
awarded by International Competitive Bidding(ICB).&#13;
&#13;
139.     For contracts with the commercial bank or other financial firm to handle cash&#13;
payments, single source selection may be used provided it is done with prior approval o f&#13;

awarded by National Competitive Bidding(NCB) as described inparagraphs 3.3 and 3.4 o f&#13;
the IDA procurement guidelines. Due to the urgency o f the Program, and in order to&#13;
facilitate the speedy procurement o f immediately required drugs and other critical items,&#13;
international and national shopping methods would be employed more than is customary in&#13;
Bank financed projects. Hence, drugs, reagents, and medical items estimated to cost not&#13;
exceeding the equivalent o f US$ 150,000 per contract as well as other goods not exceeding&#13;
the equivalent of $50,000 may be procured on the basis o f comparison of at least three&#13;
quotations at national or international level in accordance with the provisions ofparagraphs&#13;
3.5 and 3.6 o f the Guidelines. A sample format for international shopping would be&#13;

exceptional basis, civil works estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract may be procured on the basis o f quotations obtained from at least three qualified&#13;
contractors in response to a written invitation. The written invitation would include a&#13;
description o f the works, basic technical specifications, completion date and if necessary&#13;
the plan o f the works. The contract may be awarded to the contractor who offers the lowest&#13;
quotation provided that the bidis substantially responsive to the conditions specified inthe&#13;
written invitation. A simple format of the invitation with all the subsequent documents&#13;
(instruction to bidders, model o f contract etc.) would be included in the Program&#13;
implementation manual.&#13;
&#13;

local institutions responsible for the execution o f the Program: CONADER, Provincial&#13;
Program Offices, district administrations as well as associations and community-based&#13;
groups. The Grant would also finance technical studies in support o f Program execution,&#13;
the monitoring o f Program components, external financial audits and external Program&#13;
evaluations.&#13;
&#13;
146.    All consultant services estimated to cost more than US$ 100,000 equivalent per&#13;

&#13;
5.4   Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
153.    Project monitoring and evaluation will draw upon a comprehensive Management&#13;
Information System (MIS) that will combine in a modular fashion databases relative to (a)&#13;
individual ex-combatants information, (b) payments o f transitional safety net allowances,&#13;
(c) employers, training providers, and consultants in principle accessible to ex-combatants,&#13;
and (d) accounting and financial management information. Regional offices will have&#13;
access to the M I S and will be connected to the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit in&#13;
CONADER's Kinshasa office via satellite, thus allowing for the timely exchange o f&#13;
information. Ad hoc studies will be carried out as needed. These will include a formal&#13;
evaluation o f the demobilization process as well as regular beneficiary assessments,&#13;
combining both quantitative and qualitative methods. A mid-term review will be carried&#13;
out by the government and the Bank. An implementation completion report will be&#13;
prepared within six months o f the Credit closing, with the government o f DRC contribution&#13;
included.&#13;
&#13;
154.    The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit will ensure that information i s provided and&#13;
shared regularly, so as to be an effective tool for project management. The M and E Unit&#13;
will also be responsible for measuring project performance against the agreed performance&#13;
indicators specified below. Specifically, the M and EUnitwill (a) monitor the functioning&#13;
and effective utilization o f the MIS, (b) organize and supervise ad hoc evaluation studies,&#13;
(c) provide timely feedback to CONADER management, (d) prepare regular reports for&#13;
CONADER, government and donors.&#13;
&#13;
155.    DDRcomponent. Monitoring o fthe DDRcomponent aims at ensuringthat project&#13;
benefits are provided in a timely and effective manner and that leakage is minimal.&#13;
Information on beneficiaries will be entered in the M I S during the demobilization phase&#13;
and transmitted to the pertinent regional DDR office to allow individualized follow-up. At&#13;
the same time, a robust system o f non-transferable picture IDSwill deter misuse and make&#13;
forgery difficult.   Regional offices will be expected to update information on each&#13;
beneficiary promptly, and transmit it to the M and E Unit. At any point during project&#13;
implementation, therefore, the MIS should provide a comprehensive and detailed picture o f&#13;
the status o f reintegration for each ex-combatant. Information on children associated with&#13;
the armed forces will be sent by the TOCs to the closest regional DDR office on a monthly&#13;
basis (the TOCs will not have direct access to the MIS), and the office will enter it into the&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
156.    A strong local presence through the regional offices will makeit possible to follow&#13;
project execution closely. In addition, for the first year o f project implementation, each&#13;
regional DDR office will have a special liaison officer who will answer beneficiary&#13;
concerns and take stock o f the problems encountered. The liaison officer will also make&#13;
visits to a sample o f combatants in their community o f settlement with the purpose o f&#13;
assessingthe success o f reintegration efforts and provide feedback to the Coordination Unit&#13;
on a regular basis. UNICEF teams and a Child Soldier Specialist will visit Children&#13;
associated with the armed forces.regularly from the CONADER central office.&#13;

 5.5    Program Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
 157.    The DRCDRP is designed to aid the sustainable social and economic reintegration&#13;
 o f ex-combatants. In this regard, it would make a positive contribution to the socio-&#13;
 economic status o f ex-combatants, their families and their communities of settlement. The&#13;
 Program would also foster micro-economic recovery by transforming ex-combatants into&#13;
 positive economic actors and injecting financial resources at the local level. Furthermore,&#13;
 the Program would encourage national reconciliation. Although CONADER itself is a&#13;
 temporary structure, the Program would strengthen Government capacities at the provincial&#13;
 level for developing, managing and monitoring development interventions.&#13;

6    BenefitsandRisks&#13;
6.1    Benefits&#13;
&#13;
158.    The Programwould enable the Government to consolidate the peace process and its&#13;
social and economic recovery efforts. The Program i s designed to facilitate and expedite&#13;
the process o f returning about 150,000 ex-combatants to productive social and economic&#13;
life. Increased security following the first stage o f the disarmament, demobilization and&#13;
reintegration process should contribute to a returnto normalcy in agricultural activities and&#13;
livestock husbandry, ease transport constraints and provide an enabling environment for the&#13;
return o f displaced populations, elections and social investments.&#13;
&#13;
159.    A secondary benefit would be the freeing up o f resources currently allocated to the&#13;
defense and security sectors, and their reallocation towards social and economic sectors.&#13;
Such public expenditure restructuring would allow Government to restore expenditure&#13;
levels inthe social sectors inline with its poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
160.    It is anticipated that the current positive political momentum, aided by successful&#13;
implementation o f the proposed DRCDRP, would contribute to increased development&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;
6.2    Risks andMitigationMeasures&#13;
&#13;
161.    Program external risks. There are two significant external risks:&#13;
&#13;
     (i)     A failure to implement the political and security aspects o f the Accord Global&#13;
             and the subsequent cease-fire agreements and protocols, especially the sensitive&#13;
             military integration process, could undermine the PNDDR. Even if large-scale&#13;
             violent conflict did not resume, delays inthe implementation of these provisions&#13;
             o f the agreements might delay Program implementation;&#13;
     (ii)    the support o fMONUC i s critical to the disarmament phase. A failure to finance&#13;
             MONUC couldjeopardize the implementation o fthe Program.&#13;
&#13;
162.    These external risks are mitigatedby several factors:&#13;
&#13;
     (i)     First, the integration o f all parties into state institutions has increased their stake&#13;
             inthe consolidationofthepeace;&#13;
     (ii)    the continued deployment o f MONUC helps to provide confidence in the&#13;
             security aspects o f the process and serves as a deterrent for renewed efforts to&#13;
             destabilize the Government;&#13;
     (iii)   the Government's preparation o f the PNDDR provides an indication o f its&#13;
             commitment to the implementation o f the peace process and to defense and&#13;
             security sector reform, and in itself serves as an important confidence-building&#13;
             measure.&#13;
&#13;
163.    In the event o f a collapse of the overall peace process and resumption o fhostilities,&#13;
IDAwould consider exercising its remedies under the legal agreement.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergency Demobilization and ReintegrationProject - Technical Annex                   38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
164.    The major Program-specific risks and mitigation measures are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
               Program resources would possibly be diverted toward military spending.&#13;
               Appropriate safeguards with respect to financial management, procurement&#13;
               and disbursement have been put in place to avoid any such misuse o f&#13;
               Programresources;&#13;
               Savings from the downsizing o f the armed forces do not translate into&#13;
               increased spending in the health and education sectors. Government&#13;
               expenditures would be carefully monitored by IDA in the context o f its&#13;
               overall assistanceprogram;&#13;
               Given the limited human resource capacity in Congo's public and private&#13;
               sectors, implementation is unsatisfactory. The Program would carefully&#13;
               monitor implementationprogress and actual reintegration experiences o f ex-&#13;
               combatants. C,ONADER would be reinforced with additional qualified staff&#13;
               and technical assistance as required;&#13;
               HIV/AIDS spreads via the ex-combatants demobilized under the PNDDR.&#13;
               The HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation measures included in the&#13;
               Program's design would mitigate this risk significantly; and&#13;
               Donors do not provide sufficient resources to fully cover the funding gap.&#13;
               The Bank has closely consulted donor and UN partners to ensure broad-&#13;
               based support and adequate financial assistance for the Program. Pledges&#13;
               received so far cover the funding gap. If sufficient donor funds were not&#13;
               forthcoming nevertheless, Program parameters would be adjusted to the&#13;
               available resources.&#13;
&#13;
6.3   Environmental and SociaIAspects&#13;
&#13;
165.    Building on lessons from reintegration programs for displaced persons and ex-&#13;
combatants inDRC and elsewhere, the Program contains a number o f specific elements to&#13;
identify social and environmental risks and devise appropriate mitigation measures. These&#13;
procedures and measures will be elaborated in the social and environmental framework&#13;
developed for the Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP) by&#13;
the Africa Region's Social and Environmental Safeguards unit (ASPEN) in collaboration&#13;
with the MDW Secretariat. Relevant procedures and measures would be detailed in the&#13;
Program Implementation Manual (see Attachment 8 for a detailed description o f social and&#13;
environmental management arrangements).&#13;
&#13;
166.    The Program is classified as environmental category Byas it includes support to&#13;
income-generating activities. However, the phased and widely dispersed reintegration of&#13;
150,000 ex-combatants into civilian life is expected to be environmentally neutral.&#13;
Furthermore, the Program would not finance the construction or rehabilitation o f&#13;
infrastructure other than the rehabilitation o f demobilization centers. Furthermore, adequate&#13;
arrangements for medical waste disposal o f HIV/AIDS testing materials would be included&#13;
inthe Programimplementationmanual.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DRC - Emergencv Demobilization and Reintegration Proiect - TechnicalAnnex                     39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
167.      The DRCDRP would seek to promote participatory social and environmental&#13;
monitoring. Annual evaluations would include an assessment of, among others: the&#13;
procedures to access land; the occurrence o f involuntary displacement or resettlement; the&#13;
degree o f community acceptance; the existence o f discrimination on the basis o f gender or&#13;
previous military affiliation; the level o f personal security o f ex-combatants; the inclusion&#13;
o f Batwa ex-combatants in the program's activities; the level o f criminal activities&#13;
undertaken by ex-combatants; and the impact o f reintegration on an ex-combatant's family&#13;
members. These evaluations would help to identify social and environmental impacts,&#13;
determine the appropriateness o fprocedures and processes, and make recommendations for&#13;
improvements where necessary.&#13;
&#13;
7         Financialand Economic Justification&#13;
&#13;
168.     Macro-economic context. An analysis o f defense expenditure in relation to key&#13;
economic and financial data permits an assessment o f the potential long-term impact o f&#13;
military downsizing on social and economic development. Three main sources have been&#13;
&#13;
projections for 2004 - 2006; (ii) FA-RDC salary structure; and (iii) on expenditure&#13;
used: (i)GDP and other macroeconomic data from the IMF for 2000 to 2003, with&#13;
                                    the                                       data&#13;
from the Ministry o f Finance.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
169.    Impact of Demobilization. The analysis o f the impact o f demobilization is based on&#13;
several assumptions, and i s therefore only indicative.        5  Although 150,000 combatants&#13;
would be demobilized under the PNDDR, the calculation o f the Program's fiscal impact is&#13;
based on the planned net reduction inforce o f the FADRC to 150,000 from the current size&#13;
o f 300,000.&#13;
170.    With demobilization completed during 2006, the net reduction in force o f 150,000&#13;
soldiers would reduce defense expenditure by approximately US$ 29 million annually as a&#13;
result o f a savings inwages. The share o f defense expenditure in total current expenditure&#13;
would decrease from 12% in 2002 to 10.8% in 2006. Social sector expenditures would&#13;
increase 10 fold over the same period.&#13;
&#13;
171.    Analysis of alternatives. The Government's proposals, and the IDA appraisal o f it,&#13;
have taken into consideration various alternatives in the design o f the DRCDFW. The final&#13;
design is based on best practices and responds to the specific requirements o f the situation&#13;
inDRC. It pursues a gradual approach to demobilization and reintegration as comparedto&#13;
a simple one-off discharge. The political and security requirements stipulated inthe Global&#13;
Accords, stabilization o f the country before and during elections, the need for a structured&#13;
defense and security sector reform process, and the difficulty o f economic reintegration in&#13;
the immediate post-war period were judged to justify the related short-term defense&#13;
expenditure costs.&#13;
&#13;
172.    The Program tries to support the reintegration o f ex-combatants into civilian life by&#13;
providing a transitional safety net to facilitate the re-establishment of households and to&#13;
avoid social tensions. The Program's design attempts to minimize interference with market&#13;
forces and to maximize individual choice and synergies with ongoing interventions.&#13;
Furthermore, economic reintegration measures are based on the socio-economic profile o f&#13;
the ex-combatants, their own efforts and aspirations, and the specific opportunity structure&#13;
intheir communities ofretum.&#13;
&#13;
173.    Cost-effectiveness analysis. The Program design seeks to minimize costs without&#13;
compromising quality. Whenever possible, existing structures would be used rather than&#13;
parallel systems created. With overall per capita costs o f US$1228 equivalent, the costs o f&#13;
the DRCDRP are within the range established by the MDRP framework.&#13;
&#13;
174.    Cost-benejt analysis. It i s instructive to compare the total cost o f the program&#13;
excluding funding for special groups, US$184 million, with the direct savings inrecurrent&#13;
cost to the Government's budget from the medium-term net reduction in force o f 150,000&#13;
soldiers. Compared to the counterfactual, the reduction in force would save approximately&#13;
US$81 million during the Program's duration and US$27 million annually thereafter.&#13;
Fiscal savings from demobilization would thus exceed Program costs in approximately 7&#13;
years. This calculation does not take into account long-term savings in overhead costs,&#13;
including training and maintenance o f material. Finally, this simple comparison does not&#13;
take into account productivity gains and benefits to the communities and households o f the&#13;
ex-combatants' retum to civilian life.&#13;

&#13;
                   Social and Environmental Safeguard Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
The DRC Demobilization and Reintegration Program aims to demobilize a large number&#13;
o f ex-combatants and support their reintegration into civilian life. To enhance the chance&#13;
o f success, the DRCDRP needs to address a range o f social and environmental issues&#13;
effectively. To this end, within six months o f Grant Effectiveness, an Environmental&#13;
Assessment including an Environmental and Social Framework and an Environmental&#13;
and Social Management Plan will be prepared and disclosed. Its purpose will be to&#13;
identify potential social and environmental impacts, summarize the social and&#13;
environmental mitigation measures implemented under the Program, outline targeted&#13;
monitoring and evaluation activities, and propose institutional capacity building&#13;
activities.   These procedures and methods will be elaborated in the Program&#13;
Implementation Manual.&#13;
&#13;
1.      Social and Environmental Dimensions&#13;
&#13;
1.1      Successful long-term reintegration o f ex-combatants can make a major&#13;
contribution to conflict resolution and the restoration o f social capital, while failure to&#13;
achieve reintegration can lead to crime and insecurity and also increase the risk o f&#13;
resumed.conflict. Reintegration takes place at the community level, and the perceptions,&#13;
attitudes and organizational capacity o f communities to receive and support ex-&#13;
combatants become a major factor for determining the success or failure of a&#13;
demobilization andreintegration program.&#13;
&#13;
1.2     Ex-combatants may face profound social reintegration problems. There may be a&#13;
generalized fear that ex-combatants are merely conveyers o f violence, crime and sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases. Communities may then resent support provided to what is perceived&#13;
as an overly privileged group. Ex-combatants may be discriminated against on the basis&#13;
o f previous military affiliation. Their personal security may be at risk, especially if they&#13;
committed atrocities inthe communities to which they return.&#13;
&#13;
1.3     Female ex-combatants who have become accustomed to a more independent way&#13;
of life in the military may struggle to adapt to the expectations o f traditional&#13;
communities. Female partners o f ex-combatants and their children who migrate to&#13;
communities o f other ethnic, linguistic and/or cultural backgrounds may be rejected. Last&#13;
but not least, the years o f development children lose to military life profoundly affect&#13;
their future identity.&#13;
&#13;
1.4     Ex-combatantsmay also exert pressure on the natural resource base, especially in&#13;
communities with highpopulation densities. Community members may be involuntarily&#13;
displaced or ex-combatants involuntarily resettled to communities that are not o f their&#13;
choice. Traditional tenure arrangements may bar female ex-combatants from access to&#13;
land. Ex-combatants may start income-generating activities that, ifuncontrolled, may&#13;
lead to overgrazing, deforestationor improper waste management.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                               49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Social and Environmental Management Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
     2.1     Buildingon lessons from reintegrationprograms for displacedpersons and ex-&#13;
c-&#13;
     combatants inDRC and elsewhere, the Program contains a number o f specific elements&#13;
     to identify social and environmental risks and devise appropriate mitigation measures.&#13;
     These procedures and measures will be based upon a social and environmental&#13;
     framework developed for the Multi-Country Demobilization and ReintegrationProgram&#13;
     (MDRP)bythe Africa Region's Social andEnvironmental Safeguards unit(ASPEN) in&#13;
     collaboration with the MDRP Secretariat. They will be described indetail inthe Program&#13;
     ImplementationManual.&#13;
&#13;
     2.2     Access to land. The program would seek to facilitate access o f ex-combatants to&#13;
     land inareas o f return inaccordance with local land tenure systems andwith support&#13;
     from local authorities. The following principles would be applied: (i)   the program would&#13;
     not bear the cost o f land acquisition; (ii)&#13;
                                                ex-combatants will be free to settle inthe&#13;
     community o f their choice; (iii) no citizen would be compelled to cede any landto an ex-&#13;
     combatant; (iv) thus there would be no involuntary displacement o f civilians as a result o f&#13;
     ex-combatants settling ina community.&#13;
&#13;
     2.4     Social reintegration. The principle objective o fthe social reintegration assistance&#13;
     would be to ease the return o f ex-combatants into civilian life while promoting&#13;
     reconciliation andharmony. Given that a significant proportiono f the target group would&#13;
     have spent a significant period o f time inmilitary service, many have only knownwar in&#13;
     their adult life. This fact, coupledwith the lack o fprevious work experience and low&#13;
     educational levels of many o f the former soldiers, will require social support following&#13;
     their return to communities.&#13;
&#13;
     2.5     Facilitators working with ex-combatants would undertake activities to promote&#13;
     the social reintegration process, including:&#13;
&#13;
                 Community level sensitization and confidence buildingprograms;&#13;
                 Assessments o f community perceptionso f ex-combatants arid ex-combatants'&#13;
                 perceptions o f communities; Awareness-raising programs focused on civic&#13;
                 rights and responsibilities;&#13;
                 Information and counselingon sexually transmitted infections (STIs),&#13;
                 HIV/AIDS, health and sanitation;&#13;
                 Media campaigns through radio, posters, pamphlets and print media;&#13;
                 Conflict analysis and reconciliation activities inareas o f real or potential&#13;
                 tension to develop concrete interventions to diffuse potential conflict; and&#13;
                 Community activities (cultural, sporting events or work projects), which&#13;
                 promote social cohesion and help to rebuild social capital inreturn&#13;
                 communities.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                           50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.7       Gender. While it appears unlikely that the number o f female ex-combatants to be&#13;
demobilized will be sizeable, the PNDDRwould provide targeted support for the social&#13;
and economic reintegration o f female ex-combatants. Specific measures would include&#13;
the following:&#13;
&#13;
              Provision o f information and training to CONADER and M O N U C concerning&#13;
               the eligibility o f female ex-combatants for PNDDR assistance;&#13;
               Sensitization inpre-disarmament assembly areas about the eligibility o f&#13;
               female ex-combatants for PNDDRassistance;&#13;
               ensuring that all benefits for ex-combatants are equal for and equally&#13;
               accessible to menand women;&#13;
               encouraging implementing partners to ensure that their reintegration support&#13;
               activities facilitate the participation o f female ex-combatants;&#13;
               encouraging female ex-combatants to participate inexisting women's&#13;
               associations;&#13;
               including partners o f ex-combatants and women incommunities o f retum in&#13;
               community-level counseling activities;&#13;
               strengthening the gender awareness and capacity o f the staff o f the&#13;
               CONADER and authorities o f the communities to which a significant number&#13;
               o f female ex-combatants may return; and&#13;
              monitoring the impact o f the Program on partners o f ex-combatants and&#13;
               women incommunities o f return and bringingemergingproblems to the&#13;
               attentiono f the relevant authorities.&#13;
&#13;
2.8      Disabled ex-combatants.6 To date, only limited medical and economic assistance&#13;
has been provided to disabled ex-combatants. The PNDDR would provide assistance for&#13;
medical rehabilitation depending on the degree o f disability, and including the provision&#13;
o f physical rehabilitation assistance (prosthesis and orthesis), counseling, vocational&#13;
training and/or support for micro-enterprise activities. Furthermore, the PNDDR would&#13;
seek to reinforce key medical facilities (such as the provincial orthopedic workshops inor&#13;
near areas o f return) to provide systematic prosthetic and physiotherapy services,&#13;
including maintenance o fprosthetic devices, to ex-combatants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Disability is defined as functional limitation within an individual caused by physical, mental or sensory&#13;
impairment. Ifthe pattern o f disability among ex-combatants follows national averages, about three infive&#13;
disabled soldiers are likely to have traumatic injuries resulting inloss o f limb through amputation (due to&#13;
war, landmines, or accident) and about two in five disability originating from disease and resulting in loss&#13;
o f a bodily function (e.g. deafness, blindness, paralysis due to poliomyelitis&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                         51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.11     Under age ex-combatants. In close coordination with the National Child Soldier&#13;
Demobilization and Reinsertion Project and UNICEF, the D R C D W will support&#13;
assistance to underage soldiers and other minors associated with both armed forces in&#13;
accordance with the Cape Town Principle definition o f "child soldiers". Assistance for&#13;
the reintegration o f children associated with the armed forces would include family&#13;
tracing and unification, trauma counseling and psycho-social care, and facilitation o f&#13;
access to education and recreation in communities o f settlement. Children older than 15&#13;
years may have different needs and would receive appropriate support (e.g., for&#13;
vocational training).&#13;
&#13;
2.12    Environmental classzj5cation. The program is classified as environmental category&#13;
B, although the phased andwidely dispersed reintegrationo f 150,000 ex-combatants into&#13;
civilian life over a period o f four years is expected to be environmentally neutral.&#13;
Furthermore, the program will not finance the construction or rehabilitation o f&#13;
infrastructure other than the possible small-scale rehabilitation o f Orientation Centers.&#13;
Environmental mitigation measures under the program include the screening and&#13;
monitoring o f sub-projects financed under the reintegration component for environmental&#13;
impact according to the procedures, acceptable to IDA, set up bythe Government.&#13;
&#13;
2.13    Environmental screening. Community works activities and income-generating&#13;
activities would be screened for environmental impact using screening mechanisms&#13;
developed for the MDRP.The objective o f environmental screening would be to&#13;
minimize the negative environmental impacts o f the Program. The screening procedures&#13;
will betailored to the small-scale nature o f community works andincome-generating&#13;
activities, examining the potential for impacts and identifying any mitigation measures.&#13;
The focus o fthe screening would be on the following issues: health, water and sanitation,&#13;
natural resource exploitation, erosion, pesticide use and any other safeguard-related issue.&#13;
The screening will also assess the potential environmental impact of community works&#13;
andincome-generatingactivities on neighboringcommunities. Incase o fwider negative&#13;
environmental impact, actions would be agreed upon with the relevant local&#13;
administrations.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Social and Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
3.1      The DRCDRP will seek to promote participatory social and environmental&#13;
monitoring. Annual evaluations would include an assessment of, among other things: the&#13;
procedures governing access to land; the occurrence o f involuntary displacement or&#13;
resettlement; the degree o f community acceptance; the existence o f discrimination on the&#13;
basis of gender or previous military affiliation; the level o f personal security o f ex-&#13;
combatants; the level o f criminal activities undertaken by ex-combatants; and the impact&#13;
on an ex-combatant's family members.The evaluations would help to identify social and&#13;
environmental impact, determine the appropriateness o f procedures and processes, and&#13;
make recommendations for improvements where necessary.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                           52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.2     Social assessment. Shortly after Grant effectiveness and building on relevant&#13;
preparatory activities (preparation o f the sensitization program and o f the pre-discharge&#13;
orientation), a social assessment will beundertaken and will include the following:&#13;
&#13;
    (i) Astakeholderanalysis;&#13;
    (ii) Aninstitutionalcapacitydiagnostic;&#13;
    (iii)   The development o f a public consultation mechanism as part o f the PNDDR's&#13;
            sensitization program; and&#13;
    (iv)    The design o f a participatory monitoring and evaluation framework.&#13;
&#13;
3.3     The social assessment will help identify the social and cultural structure o f&#13;
incentives and constraints that guide and govern behavior with respect to buildingsocial&#13;
cohesion and promoting the sustainable use o f natural resources. Furthermore, it will help&#13;
determine the relevant social indicators for participatory monitoring, including on the&#13;
social exclusion o f returning ex-combatants. Also, attention will be paid to returning&#13;
Batwa ex-combatants in project areas to ensure that they fully benefit from project's&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
3.4     Information will be distributed horizontally (especially important for the&#13;
beneficiaries and in general for sake o f transparency) and vertically in the management&#13;
structure o f the Program. Information will be readily available for assembly and analysis&#13;
into periodic monitoring and evaluation reports. The Program's                   computerized&#13;
Management Infomation System will be built around these parameters.&#13;
&#13;
3.5     Independent evaluations. A special Program element would be annual evaluations&#13;
of environmental and social indicators as part o f the annual Program evaluation&#13;
undertaken by independent consultants. These evaluations would include a beneficiary&#13;
assessment and a review o f Program achievements. The issues to be addressed would&#13;
include, among other things: the procedures governing access to land; the occurrence o f&#13;
involuntary displacement or resettlement; the degree o f community acceptance; the&#13;
existence o f discrimination on the basis o f gender or previous military affiliation; the&#13;
level o f personal security o f ex-combatants; the level o f criminal activities undertakenby&#13;
ex-combatants; and the impact on an ex-combatant's family members. The evaluations&#13;
would help to identify social and environmental impacts, determine the appropriateness&#13;
o f procedures and processes, and make recommendations for improvements where&#13;
necessary.&#13;
&#13;
3.6     The monitoring and evaluation system is designed in such a way that the regular&#13;
review o f social and environmental aspects is part andparcel o fProgram implementation,&#13;
and that mitigation measures would be initiated quickly as needed.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                  53&#13;

            Congo, Democratic Republic of - Emergency
            Demobilization and Reintegration Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The general objective of the Emergency
            Demobilization and Reintegration Project is to help
            consolidate peace and promote economic stability and
            sustainable development in the Democratic Republic of Congo
            and in the greater Great Lakes region. The specific
            objectives of the program will be a) to demobilize up to an
            estimated 150,000 ex-combatants and to help support their
            return into civilian life b) to promote the reallocation of
            Government expenditure from military to social and economic
            sectors. The project is expected to have a significant
            impact o n reducing poverty in the DRC by: establishing more
            secure conditions in the rural areas that will encourage the
            general population and internally displaced persons to
            resume productive lives in the rural economy; freeing up
            additional national resources for investment in social and
            economic sectors; and investing in the human capital of
            ex-combatants. The project consists of the following
            activities: (i) Sensitization; (ii) Orientation/
            demobilization; (iii) Transition; (iv) Reinsertion; (v)
            Special groups; and (vi) Institutional development and
            Program implementation support. The following demobilization
            activities are envisaged: (i) the establishment of
            orientation centers; (ii) verification of ex-combatant
            status; (iii) provision of identity cards; (iv) collection
            of socio-economic data; (v) pre-demobilization orientation
            about civilian life and program benefits; and (vi) medical
            screening (including HIV/AIDS counseling and voluntary
            testing). Demobilization activities will be guided by the
            Joint Operations Plan, which coordinates the military
            restructuring with the demobilization process. As a part of
            reinsertion assistance, all ex-combatants would receive a
            Basic Needs Kit (BNK). The BNK would provide the following
            assistance to facilitate the initial transition to civilian
            life of ex-combatants: (i) transport and food allowance,
            most probably in the form of a $30 cash grant; (ii) basic
            household items kit. A transitional subsistence allowance
            will be provided in cash in installments.  Reintegration
            assistance will be provided to help ex-combatants
            re-introduce themselves into their communities and establish
            sustainable livelihoods. The following activities would form
            the core of the assistance provided to ex-combatants during
            this phase: provision of information, counseling and
            referral services; vocational training, formal and informal
            apprenticeship schemes, and educational opportunities.
