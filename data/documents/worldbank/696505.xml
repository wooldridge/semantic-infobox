PRIVATE SECTOR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1     Sri Lanka's US$10 billion economy is built on a richly endowed and varied agricultural&#13;
resource base with a low population growth rate and exceptional social indicators. Its per capita&#13;
income, at US$550, is the highest among countries in South Asia. Although the country's recent&#13;
history has been marked by political upheavals, including assassinations of key public figures&#13;
and shifting prospects for peace in the ongoing armed conflict in the North, there have been two&#13;
periods of high economic growth (1977-84 and 1989-1994).  Both periods have followed&#13;
significant reform initiatives, deregulation and a shift towards market orientation. The focus of&#13;
the reform effort has nlow shifted to addressing fundamental growth-limiting factors, such as the&#13;
overextended and poorly performing public sector and infrastructure constraints.&#13;
1.2    The present Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL)i has largely maintained the progressive&#13;
economic reform and private sector investment policies of the previous government. However,&#13;
the Government's ability to maintain the pace of economic growth at a level of six percent per&#13;
annum  is strongly predicated both on sustained macroeconomic confidence and the speed and&#13;
efficiency with which critical infrastructure services can be upgraded and delivered. For several&#13;
years, public investment in and execution of infrastructure projects has been below expectations.&#13;
New construction and the rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure stock have been supported&#13;
almost exclusively by donor funding. The effectiveness of this lending has been diminished by&#13;
chronic operational weaknesses of line agencies which have led to procurement and&#13;
implementation delays. As a result, serious bottlenecks are evident in the delivery of power,&#13;
transport and water/sanitation services.&#13;
1.3    Government policy since 19922 has been oriented towards enhancing the efficiency of&#13;
infrastructure provision, improving managerial expertise and securing more modern technology&#13;
through private sector participation. GOSL's initiatives to seek private sector investments, both&#13;
in the form of privatization and greenfield projects, have been heightened by the increased&#13;
pressure on budget resources imposed by the civil conflict. The progress in actually closing&#13;
deals with private sector investors has been slow. However, the successful privatization of the&#13;
Colombo Gas Company, followed by the finalization of the Build-Own-Transfer (BOT) project&#13;
The present Government came to power through elections in the latter half of 1994. Led by the People's Alliance, it&#13;
replaced a government led by the United National Party since 1977.&#13;
2 This policy initiative for private sector participation in infrastructure was strongly supported by a USS10 million&#13;
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) technical assistance project (ongoing) which includes&#13;
institutional building, training, market outreach and a comprehensive public education program. Similar USAID&#13;
initiatives have contributed to successful private sector infrastructure investment programs in Pakistan. the&#13;
Philippines, and Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
agreement for a 51 MW diesel-fired power generation plant with a private consortium in&#13;
December 1995 has set the stage for further private sector initiatives.&#13;
1.4    The proposed project seeks to develop a modern and efficient infrastructure system in Sri&#13;
Lanka by promoting significant participation of the private sector in the investment, operation,&#13;
ownership, and maintenance of infrastructure facilities. The project will enable potential investors&#13;
to access long-term  financing (the lack of which presently hinders infrastructure project&#13;
development) through a single purpose government owned company, the Private Sector&#13;
Infrastructure Development Company (PSIDC). PSIDC will provide long-term subordinated debt&#13;
at rates based on prevailing market conditions for infrastructure projects in tandem with additional&#13;
private sector debt and equity. The leveraginig of private sector financing will also induce&#13;
operational efficiency and techniology transfer inhierent in private sector operations.  In&#13;
collaboration with USAID, techniical assistance provided under the proposed credit will help&#13;
strengthen GOSL's ability to evaluate and negotiate private infrastructure projects.&#13;
1.5    The proposed project will supplement rather than replace traditional sources of funding.&#13;
Thus, sub-borrowers will be encouraged to maximize the use of export credits and seek the&#13;
assistance of institutions with a mandate to support private investments in infrastructure facilities&#13;
such as International Finance Corporation (IFC), Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
(MIGA), Asian Development Bank's (ADB) private sector wing, and Canadian Commonwealth&#13;
Development Corporation (CDC). PSIDC is expected to work very closely with these agencies&#13;
and with commercial lenders in reviewing and finanlcing subprojects to provide complementary&#13;
financing.&#13;
II. POLICY ENVIRONMENT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
FINANCED INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
A. The State of Sri Lanka's Infrastructure&#13;
2.1    Sri Lanka has registered impressive achievements in non-traditional exports and&#13;
maintained a consistent growth path. Value-added in manufacturing has grown by 8.8 percent&#13;
per annum on average during 1990-94, contributing a third to gross domestic product (GDP)&#13;
growth. However, sustaining this growth requires immediate attention to infrastructure&#13;
deficiencies. In the power sector, the absence of new generation capacity is causing shortages.&#13;
In the road subsector, rapid expansion in traffic volume, fueled by rising industrial and&#13;
commercial activity, has led to serious transport bottlenecks, especially in the Greater Colombo&#13;
area. The capacity expansion of key traffic corridors, such as Colombo-Katunayake, Colombo-&#13;
Galle and Colombo-Kandy, has become critical to sustaining the competitiveness of Sri Lanka's&#13;
agricultural and manufactured exports. The unsatisfied demand for telecommunication services&#13;
is estimated to exceed the number of currently connected subscribers.&#13;
2.2    Per capita availability of power, measured by households with access to electricity,&#13;
shows that Sri Lanka lags behind India. It fares much worse when compared to East Asian&#13;
countries  (see Table 1).  System  losses are comparable to India's, but quite high when&#13;
compared with Thailand's or Malaysia's. Despite Sri Lanka's smaller size and plentiful water&#13;
resources, access to safe drinking water is marginally worse than  in India. In the&#13;
telecommunications sector, Sri Lanka has 12 phone lines per thousand people compared to 31 in&#13;
Thailand and 111 in Malaysia. Although call completion rates in Sri Lanka are better than in its&#13;
South Asian neighbors, there is need for improvement as compared with the more progressive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
East Asian countries. In the road subsector, although Sri Lanka has a good network, years of&#13;
neglect and under-investment have eroded the infrastructure stock, resulting in poor rankings in&#13;
terms of paved roads in good condition.  Over the last decade, Colombo Port, which is&#13;
acknowledged as the best run port in the region, has emerged as a major transshipment center for&#13;
containers. However, it lags far behind its main competitor, Singapore, in terms of efficiency.&#13;
B. Infrastructure and Competitiveness&#13;
2.3      Several studies conducted in Sri Lanka in the recent past have underscored the&#13;
importance that industries and business establishments attach to adequate and reliable provision&#13;
of infrastructure services. The Bank's Private Sector Assessment (PSA) conducted in 1994 and&#13;
the Industrial Infrastructure Assessments carried out in 1992 and 1994 reveal that industries and&#13;
businesses face high economic costs due to infrastructure deficiencies, such as rescheduling&#13;
production and providing stand-by generation and timely movements of inventory and products.&#13;
With the increasing trend towards the outsourcing of intermediate production to areas of skilled&#13;
and inexpensive labor, a new dimension has been added to cost competitiveness: businesses are&#13;
seeking facilities where comparative logistical costs of manufacturing and marketing are lower.&#13;
In this regard, studies reveal that logistical costs as a percentage of sales value for garment&#13;
industries, for example, are seven to ten percentage points higher in Sri Lanka than in the&#13;
Philippines, implying that Sri Lanka's export competitiveness is critically dependent on&#13;
infrastructure improvements.3&#13;

C. Constraints to Efficient Public Sector Infrastructure Provision&#13;
2.4    The operation and ownership of the vast majority of Sri Lanka's infrastructure is in the&#13;
public sector.   The private sector participates  in the provision  of bus and  ancillary&#13;
telecommunication services. Over the last three decades, both the creation of new infrastructure&#13;
and maintenance of existing assets has been under-funded, leading to serious supply constraints.4&#13;
Countries developing at the pace of Sri Lanka require annual investments of five to six percent&#13;
of GDP to maintain and renew infrastructure stocks. The ratio of investment in economic&#13;
infrastructure to GDP has never exceeded five percent, even during periods of high GDP growth.&#13;
This has led to insufficient investments in new capacity, as well as poor attention to maintenance&#13;
of existing assets. The situation has been compounded by poor management, over-staffing and&#13;
inefficient operations in most utilities. Although estimates vary, conservative projections of&#13;
required investments in energy and infrastructure indicate a need for US$2 billion in new&#13;
investments over the next seven to ten years. Securing financing for and timely implementation&#13;
of projects of this magnitude is clearly beyond the scope of the public sector. Hence, there is a&#13;
significant need to involve the private sector in the financing, operation and management of&#13;
infrastructure assets. Besides leveraging more resources and mitigating under-funding of new&#13;
investments, the country would also realize significanit efficiency gains from the injection of new&#13;
technology and managerial expertise.&#13;
D. GOSL Policies for Attracting Private Infrastructure Investments&#13;
2.5    Responding to this situation, GOSL adopted a policy in 1992 to promote private sector&#13;
participation  in infrastructure provision.  The policy had three main objectives: (a) to&#13;
complement public investment; (b) to provide additional capacity in critical areas through&#13;
privately-led investments; and (c) to mobilize private sector management resources to improve&#13;
efficiency. Despite the shift in government policy in favor of private participation, translation&#13;
into real transactions has been a difficult and contentious process.&#13;
2.6    One of the foremost reasons for slow progress in policy implementation stems from the&#13;
entrenched interests of different players in the public sector monopolies.  The absence of&#13;
capacity to deal professionally with private sector investors and to facilitate and promote&#13;
transactions also has hindered progress. Furthermore, the lack of a comprehensive legal and&#13;
regulatory framework that sets out the full policy and incentive package for private sector&#13;
investors has slowed the investment process. The lack of professional capacity to efficiently&#13;
manage project transactions involving private sector investments and the scarcity of appropriate&#13;
financing that matches the investment requirements of large infrastructure projects have also&#13;
contributed to slow progress. Table 2 revisits the constraints to the private sector provision of&#13;
infrastructure investment and sets out the current set of coordinated GOSL and donor activities&#13;
that are in train to mitigate these constraints.&#13;
2.7    In 1992, the Government established the Secretariat for Infrastructure Development and&#13;
Investment (SIDI), now the Bureau for Infrastructure Development (BID), as the institutional&#13;
instrument to interface with the private sector and promote their participation in line with the&#13;
policy objectives. BID, with technical assistance from USAID, has carried out a series of&#13;
initiatives aimed towards awareness-building, education and training and capacity-creation in&#13;
4For purposes of this paper, irrigation investments have been excluded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
government agencies for identifying, developing and evaluating private sector projects. The&#13;
policy has been successful in raising awareness among line ministries and public utilities to the&#13;
possibilities of private sector financing. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the National&#13;
Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) are&#13;
exploring project processing through Build-Own-Transfer (BOT)/Build-Own-Operate (BOO)&#13;
mechanisms directly; in so doing, they are building up their own capabilities. Currently all the&#13;
major government agencies with responsibilities for infrastructure development have explicit&#13;
private sector development programs that involve at least one project that is suitable for private&#13;
sector financing.&#13;

proposals for power generation through barge-mounted power plants and a 150 MW combined&#13;
cycle generation plant near Colombo. In the port sector, proposals have been invited through&#13;
open solicitation for refurbishment of the Queen Elizabeth Quay in the Colombo Port. Requests&#13;
for proposals for two wastewater treatment plants on a BOT basis are also to be issued soon.&#13;

2.9    Notwithstanding the progress on private sector involvement with infrastructure, as&#13;
illustrated in Table 3, both private investors and the Government realize that the lack of long-&#13;
term financing constitutes a significant barrier to closing these transactions. Box I highlights&#13;
these financial constraints. Furthermore, in line with experience from other high-risk country&#13;
environments, project sponsors seek the comfort of a multilateral presence to bolster risk&#13;
mitigation mechanisms. These factors have led GOSL to request IDA support, both for project&#13;
facilitation and financing. IDA is coordinating with USAID to firm up the institutional side of&#13;
project facilitation, and with IFC and KfW to establish appropriate financing arrangements for&#13;
maturing projects.&#13;

B2xLJ: Sri Lanka - Infrastructure Financing Constraints&#13;
It has become increasingly apparent that the inability to mobilize debt for infrastructure projects&#13;
has become a key impediment to their financing. Accounting for nearly 75 percent of a typical financing&#13;
package, the availability of debt, in terms of volume and maturities necessary for large scale infrastructure&#13;
projects, is an area of growing concern. Commercial banks have exposure limits to countries and sectors,&#13;
and find it difficult to lend at maturity terms suitable for infrastructure projects (12-15 years or more).&#13;
Other potential sources of debt, such as provident funds or insurance companies, are typically averse to&#13;
undertaking equity-like risks often associated with long-term infrastructure debt financing in developing&#13;
countries. Furthermore, if commercial lenders include the necessary risk premium to compensate fully for&#13;
the perceived riskiness of the transaction, sponsors and/or governments will often deem the price&#13;
prohibitive.&#13;
In the case of Sri Lanka, these constraints to long-term debt mobilization are compounded by the&#13;
international financial community's relatively low regard for the nation's credit-worthiness. A developing&#13;
country like Sri Lanka with balance of payments constraints cannot rely exclusively on foreign capital to&#13;
finance its infrastructure. However, with an under-developed financial sector, Sri Lanka is likely to face&#13;
severe constraints in securing long-term domestic funding for private sector infrastructure projects. The&#13;
volume of funding sourced from the local market (debt and equity) for private investment expenditure in&#13;
Sri Lanka has been quite small, only 20 percent of total new private sector investment in 1992.&#13;
Currently IDA is supporting reforms in the financial sector through the ongoing Private Sector&#13;
Development Project (PSDP) which includes the privatization of state-owned banks and insurance&#13;
companies. IFC has also been active in supporting the commercialization of pension funds and in the&#13;
development of a secondary market for government bonds. The debt market, however, remains ill-&#13;
equipped to accommodate the volume of financing necessary to support domestically financed&#13;
infrastructure projects. Private sector access to long-term domestic funds has been limited by a very strong&#13;
market for funds with short maturity terms (dominated by government paper) and a corresponding absence&#13;
of market instruments to attract funds with longer maturity terms. The situation is exacerbated by the high&#13;
retums on treasury bills, relatively risk-free instruments, that keep funds out of other instruments. The lack&#13;
of a secondary market in debt instruments further compounds the problem. There are no long-term&#13;
government bonds; and, as a result, there is no market-determined reference point to establish a yield&#13;
curve.  Furthermore, savings institutions, such as the Provident Fund and National Savings Bank,&#13;
contribute to the diversion of term savings away from the private sector since there are mandatory&#13;
placements in government securities.&#13;
E. IDA's Operational Lessons and Strategies for Supporting Private Sector&#13;
Infrastructure Development&#13;
2.10   In the past, IDA has supported infrastructure development in Sri Lanka through lending&#13;
to public sector agencies. The effectiveness of this lending has been diminished by the chronic&#13;
operational weaknesses of these agencies. Significant funding amounts under several IDA credits&#13;
for infrastructure operations in the road and power subsectors have been cancelled due to the&#13;
inability of public sector agencies to implement these credits in a timely manner, often as a&#13;
result of procurement delays. The diminished fiscal position of the public sector as a whole has&#13;
also exacerbated these operational weaknesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
2.1 1   GOSL has articulated its intention to follow the rest of Asia in supporting the increasing&#13;
demands for rapid infrastructure development through the use of the private sector. If acted&#13;
upon, sorely needed operational efficiencies, technology transfer and increased financial&#13;
resources will result.  Though it must be recognized that the private sector can only develop&#13;
projects selectively and public investment will remain extremely important, a major objective of&#13;
the World Bank Group is to influence and accelerate the transitional process from public-&#13;
dominated infrastructure to private operation and ownership. The Bank Group's proactive role in&#13;
Sri Lanka is seen as an innovative one for the promotion of private sector opportunities, given&#13;
the main emphasis on public sector lending for infrastructure by the other major donors -&#13;
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) and ADB. Furthermore, in countries eligible for&#13;
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) lending partial risk guarantees&#13;
are suitable instruments for Bank support of private infrastructure projects. However, in "IDA&#13;
only" countries other types of operations must be used. The limited credit-worthiness of these&#13;
countries means that a greater degree of direct donor support is needed to encourage private&#13;
infrastructure investments.&#13;
2.12   Over the years, the Bank has provided some financial support for private infrastructure&#13;
investments (especially in power). However, this support has generally been in the form of loans&#13;
to existing utilities and not for greenfield BOO/BOT projects financed on a limited recource&#13;
basis. The Private Sector Energy Development Fund (PSEDF) in Pakistan that was created with&#13;
the assistance of the Bank (Loan 2982-PAK) provides the most relevant experience for the&#13;
design of the proposed operations. PSEDF (see Box 2) clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of&#13;
a public-private approach at the beginning of the transitional period from public sector monopoly&#13;
to widespread private sector participation in infrastructure provisions. PSEDF gave the Bank and&#13;
other donors the ability to influence the process of private investment in infrastructure early on.&#13;
The background work and technical assistance provided under PSEDF provided the foundation&#13;
for Pakistan's policies supporting private power and infrastructure investments. The main&#13;
lessons learned from PSEDF can be summarized as follows: (a) there is a need for a central&#13;
focal point in the Government for promotion of private infrastructure projects; (b) the concerned&#13;
line ministries and agencies need to be actively involved in the solicitation and negotiation&#13;
process; (c) the financing agency needs to be independent and apply sound commercial criteria;&#13;
(d) the fund management should not provide senior loans and/or equity in order to avoid&#13;
possible conflict of interest situations; (e) it is essential to employ high caliber international&#13;
legal, financial and technical consultants for the evaluation and negotiation of the subprojects; (f)&#13;
the mere existence of the Fund can provide a strong incentive for private sponsors to make the&#13;
necessary investments in project development; (g) the initial projects should not be too large in&#13;
order to facilitate the mobilization of external financing; and (h) in low income countries with&#13;
limited credit-worthiness, the commercial lenders require the additional protection provided by&#13;
the subordination of the donor financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

BoxL2: The Privale Sector Enera Development Fund (MED]0_ Pakintan&#13;
PSEDF was designed to address a fundamental constraint to greater private sector&#13;
involvement in the energy sector in Pakistan. Specifically, PSEDF was then, and continues to be&#13;
today, a means to successfully address the issue of a lack of long-term finance for power and&#13;
energy-related infrastructure projects with relatively long periods of gestation and economic life.&#13;
PSEDF provides a source of long-term subordinated debt from which private sector sponsors can&#13;
borrow. Terms for PSEDF for subordinated loans include: (a) maturities of up to 23 years; (b)&#13;
grace periods of up to 8 years; and (c) a minimum equity of 20% in the proposed project. PSEDF&#13;
was established with Bank assistance in 1988 (Loan 2982-PAK) and was replenished in 1994&#13;
(Loan 3812-PAK). Under the former loan, an institutional framework was created for the&#13;
promotion, negotiation and financing of private energy projects. Private Power Cell was&#13;
established in the Ministry of Water and Power as the focal point for negotiation with project&#13;
sponsors, and Private Energy Department was created in the National Development Finance&#13;
Corporation (NDFC) to appraise subprojects and  manage PSEDF. Additional technical&#13;
assistance to the Government of Pakistan (GOP) was provided by USAID.&#13;
The first subproject financed through PSEDF, the Hub Power Project, took over 5 years&#13;
after the initiation of the start of construction, largely due to factors beyond the control of GOP&#13;
and project sponsors. When construction started in early 1993, the 1,292 MW Hub Project was&#13;
the largest private power plant being built in a developing country. The construction is on&#13;
schedule and start of commercial operations are expected to occur before the end of June 1996.&#13;
The negotiations for the Hub Power Project gave GOP valuable experience that led to a&#13;
fine-tuning of the institutional arrangements and the announcement of a Private Power Policy in&#13;
early 1994. Under this policy, that many developers have described as the most transparent and&#13;
best prepared in any developing country, five more power projects--with a total capacity of about&#13;
1,100 MW-- have reached financial closure. Another five projects are expected to reach&#13;
financial closure before the end of June 1996. PSEDF has also been successful in augmenting its&#13;
resources from donors, for example, in additional to the World Bank, who have contributed&#13;
US$390 million, JEXIM has contributed US$400 million.&#13;
2.13   The project incorporates these lessons and is tailored to support a selected program of&#13;
private sector investment that will: (a) leverage IDA's reduced lending involvement with private&#13;
sector resources; (b) improve operating efficiency in infrastructure; and (c) act as a catalyst for&#13;
further project development. Initiated at the beginning of the transition period when private&#13;
sector operations will be introduced into traditionally public sector managed and controlled&#13;
activities, the project will be able to influence the process of private investment, much as in&#13;
PSEDF. To date, several potential BOO/BOT-type transactions have been seriously delayed in&#13;
the very early stages which in part underlines the inexperience of GOSL in dealing with these&#13;
types of transactions. Furthermore,  Sri Lanka's poor record of attracting overseas non-&#13;
guaranteed debt will make it difficult for private sector sponsors to mobilize the required&#13;
financing for larger infrastructure projects that are urgently required. Lessons from countries in&#13;
the region indicate that for long-gestation, private sector energy and infrastructure projects, the&#13;
necessary financing can probably be mobilized only with significant support provided by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
Bank Group, other multilateral development banks and bilateral agencies. The subordination of&#13;
the long-term debt proposed under the project will give added comfort to prospective lenders,&#13;
most specifically at the initiation of the program of private sector transactions in infrastructure.&#13;
2.14   The innovative nature of the proposed operation is consistent with the World Bank&#13;
Group's country assistance strategy (CAS) as it is in support of GOSL's various efforts to ease&#13;
infrastructure constraints through significant involvement of the private sector. The project is&#13;
specifically directed at supporting large infrastructure projects, the lack of which hinders the&#13;
country's growth.  Sri Lanka's current uncertainties and the lack of confidence of the&#13;
international financial community in the country make it necessary to bring to bear the full range&#13;
of the Bank Groups' complementary financial products in order to attract private sector&#13;
investment.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin&#13;
3.1    The project originated with a growing acceptance that the private sector has a significant&#13;
role to play in infrastructure development which led to GOSL's adoption in 1992 of a policy of&#13;
encouraging private BOO/BOT operations and the creation of SIDI (now BID). Technical&#13;
assistance provided by USAID to BID has helped create awareness of private sector options in&#13;
the ministries and agencies responsible for infrastructure development and helped develop a&#13;
pipeline of potential projects. Recognizing the difficulty of mobilizing sufficient commercial&#13;
funds for private infrastructure projects once such projects are identified, GOSL requested IDA's&#13;
support in establishing a long-term subordinated debt facility. The debt facility will complement&#13;
GOSL efforts by identifying and capturing private sector resources, efficiencies, and technology&#13;
transfer in typically large-scale infrastructure projects. The project was prepared with the&#13;
assistance of a Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant provided by the&#13;
Government of Japan.&#13;
B. PiQ-jct Objectives&#13;
3.2    The overall objective of the project is to develop a modern and efficient infrastructure&#13;
system  in Sri Lanka by promoting significant private sector participation.  More detailed&#13;
objectives of the project are to:&#13;
(a)    establish a GOSL facility for the placement of long-term debt that will work in&#13;
tandem with private sources of capital to facilitate potential private sector&#13;
investment;&#13;
(b)    encourage significant participation of the private sector in the investment,&#13;
implementation, operation and maintenance of new infrastructure facilities; and&#13;
The most recent CAS for Sri Lanka is dated June 13, 1996.&#13;

(c)    strengthen GOSL's ability to attract, negotiate and close private sector sponsored&#13;
infrastructure projects by increasing capabilities to evaluate and negotiate&#13;
projects with private sponsors.&#13;
C. Proiect Description and Technical Assistance&#13;
3.3    The Private Sector Infrastructure Development Project (PSIDP) would support the&#13;
establishment of a long-term debt facility and associated technical assistance consisting of:&#13;
(a) The Long-Term Debt Facility: The proposed IDA credit would provide long-term&#13;
subordinated debt for private sector infrastructure projects.6 The recently created&#13;
Private Sector Infrastructure Development Company, Ltd. (PSIDC), a public&#13;
sector company, would act as the executing agency for the project. It would&#13;
administer project funds received from official development sources, on behalf of&#13;
GOSL, and place these funds in selected private sector subprojects up to a&#13;
maximum of 40% of the total subproject cost. Subproject sponsors, who would&#13;
prepare individual subprojects, would provide the equity and arrange for the&#13;
remainder of the debt financing from  commercial sources.  Planned as a&#13;
transitional mechanism, the facility would have available US dollars for long&#13;
maturities that match new infrastructure investment needs. The facility has been&#13;
planned to accommodate additional multilateral and bilateral financing to increase&#13;
the total availability of funds. In addition to the US$70 million provided by IDA,&#13;
KfW will also provide DM 20 million or about US$14 million. ADB and OECF&#13;
have also expressed interest in supporting the project. A Project Preparation&#13;
Facility (PPF) of US$700,000 has been secured to assist with start-up costs of the&#13;
project; and&#13;
(b)   Technical Assistance: (US$7 million) Technical assistance (TA) is provided&#13;
under the project to assist in the organization, operation, management and&#13;
consultancy services for PSIDC, training and funds to support project preparation&#13;
for solicited projects in association with the line ministries and agencies. The TA&#13;
funds will be passed on as a grant from GOSL to PSIDC. Full details of the&#13;
project's TA components are set out in Annexes 4, 8, 9 and 10 and are summarized&#13;
below:&#13;
TA to support PSIDC (US$3.5 million). In order to meet project objectives, it is&#13;
necessary to ensure that requisite technical, financial and managerial&#13;
competencies are provided within PSIDC to attract serious private sector interest&#13;
and to be able to process and negotiate projects with private sector sponsors.&#13;
Besides meeting the expenses of setting up the Company office, the TA would&#13;
provide management expenses for the Company, including salaries and other&#13;
operating expenses for an initial period. The Company brochure and the&#13;
operational manuals of PSIDC would be prepared under this TA. This also&#13;
includes the provision of a long-term consultant as advisor to the General&#13;
Manager. The TA would also be used to retain the services of a consortium of&#13;
consulting firms to provide the technical, financial, legal and environmental&#13;

project to include takeout finance, senior debt, etc.&#13;

expertise on an "as required" basis to appraise, evaluate and negotiate project&#13;

PSIDC staff. The TA would be operative for a period of four years from the&#13;
start of operations of the Company.&#13;
TA  in support of Line Ministries (US$3.5 million). The credit would also&#13;
provide funds to support project preparation of individual subprojects that have&#13;
been (or will be) identified by the line agencies as suitable for private sector&#13;
investment and participation. This TA will be used in cooperation with the line&#13;
agencies to support evaluation and negotiation of subprojects. The TA will also&#13;
support the further development of existing pre-feasibility studies or the&#13;
commissioning of entirely new studies. The objective of the studies will be to&#13;
provide complete documentation to enable the solicitation of high caliber&#13;
BOT/BOO bids for infrastructure projects. The TA would also support limited&#13;
work on sectoral policy and regulation, if these are necessary to advance private&#13;
sector transactions in specific sectors, especially in areas where other&#13;
multilateral or bilateral assistance is not available.&#13;
D. Proiect Design&#13;
3.4    D.asi&amp; Rational. The rationale for PSIDC stems from the need to address constraints&#13;
experienced by project sponsors in raising long-term debt for projects in Sri Lanka. Typically&#13;
sponsors will choose non-domestic private sector financing of infrastructure projects on a non- or&#13;
limited-recourse basis, with the projects being formulated under BOO/BOT arrangements. This&#13;
means that the lenders' ability to seek payments from the sponsors and other equity holders is&#13;
limited. Since the liquidation of infrastructure assets is extremely difficult, lenders have to rely&#13;
primarily on the revenue stream of the enterprise to ensure the repayment of the loans. Since&#13;
equity participants take a higher risk, they typically demand higher returns than debt holders to&#13;
invest in developing country projects. In the infrastructure sectors, projects with a large share of&#13;
equity in the capital structure are usually not viable since the higher returns demanded by equity&#13;
holders raise the price of the output beyond the local market's paying capacity. Therefore,&#13;
infrastructure projects tend to be highly leveraged with debt-equity ratios in the range of 70:30 to&#13;
80:20. This means that they have a limited ability to adapt to changing market conditions. In&#13;
view of this risk and the large proportion of debt in the capital structure of such projects, it is&#13;
typically the willingness of commercial lenders to place debt for the project that determines its&#13;
viability. IDA's participation, in the form of long-term subordinated debt, will lessen the&#13;
transaction risks perceived by sponsors and lenders and facilitate the mobilization of senior&#13;
commercial debt.&#13;
3.5    Subordination and Limits to PSIDC Funding. Private sector infrastructure projects in&#13;
developed countries are financed with long-term debt that reasonably matches the long economic&#13;
life of the assets. For power plants, maturities typically are in the range of 15 to 20 years while&#13;
the financing for toll roads in some cases has extended as far as 40 years. In the case of Sri&#13;
Lanka, commercial debt sources typically operate on terms of three to four years, extending to&#13;
seven years in very special cases and often require government guarantees. These maturity terms&#13;
do not match the typical financing profile of infrastructure projects, where capital costs are high,&#13;
construction times are long and the projects do not generate sufficient cash flow in earlier years&#13;
to service large amounts of short-term debt. In order to provide longer maturities (up to 12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
years), commercial lenders insist on export credit insurance coverage for sovereign risks. Other&#13;
alternatives sources for long-term debt are IFC, ADB's private sector window, and CDC. The&#13;
maturities of these loans tend to be in the range of 10-12 years.&#13;
3.6    For infrastructure projects, it is essential to structure at least a portion of the debt as&#13;
loans of long maturity with a grace period in the earlier years of the project. Recovery of&#13;
principal for the long-maturity loans commences after the bulk of commercial, shorter term debt&#13;
is retired. Thus in order to provide maturities of 15 to 17 years, PSIDC would provide loans with&#13;
maturities of up to 22 years and with grace periods of up to eight years. Maturities would be&#13;
linked to the cash flow and construction periods of the subprojects, expected economic life of the&#13;
assets and the maturities of senior loans. The inclusion of senior commercial debt in the&#13;
financing package is important, since it lowers the overall financing cost of the project and&#13;
brings to the project a high degree of commercial diligence, both to financing decisions and in&#13;
structuring the security agreements.&#13;
3.7    The design of the project is significantly influenced by the experience gathered from a&#13;
wide range of international project financing transactions. The main sources of financing for&#13;
private infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka are likely to be export credit agency (ECA)&#13;
guaranteed debt, A and B loans from IFC and, to a minor extent, loans from ADB and CDC. The&#13;
extent of ECA coverage depends on the sourcing of the equipment and the country and project&#13;
ceilings that various ECAs apply for risk management purposes.7 Direct loans from IFC, ADB,&#13;
and CDC are subject to similar limitations.  IFC's B loans are further subject to market&#13;
limitations. For some smaller projects it might be possible to mobilize commercial debt with&#13;
minimal PSIDC participation. However, for high-risk "first" projects in each sector, or those of&#13;
a larger magnitude, the support of PSIDC financing is likely to be required. The project design&#13;
envisages flexible participation by PSIDC with PSIDC playing the role of the "lender of last&#13;
resort." PSIDC financing in any subproject would be limited to a maximum of 40 percent of&#13;
total project cost. Thus, the overriding objective would be to maximize leverage of private&#13;
capital sources and minimize PSIDC involvement.&#13;
3.8    Location and Governance.   The design of the facility has been guided by two&#13;
principles. Firstly, the facility would complement existing market sources of financing, i.e.,&#13;
equity and short- term commercial debt. Secondly, while respecting GOSL's important policy&#13;
oversight role, the facility would be organized and operated in a relatively autonomous fashion.&#13;
PSIDC would be professionally managed, equipped and empowered to make decisions on clearly&#13;
established commercial principles at arms length from GOSL. The project preparation process&#13;
extensively examined the viability of channeling IDA's funds through an existing financial&#13;
institution, but the size of its potential loans were seen as incompatible with the current operation&#13;
strategies of the existing institutions. The requisite size of the facility would have meant that the&#13;
repository financial institution would violate its single borrowing and capital adequacy&#13;
requirements.  Furthermore, the option of having one of the two existing private sector&#13;
development banks manage the fund was examined. However, a major objective of the proposed&#13;
project is to involve these development banks in the mobilization of the senior local debt for&#13;
subprojects. There is clear conflict of interest between the senior debt position and the&#13;
subordinated debt position if either of the domestic development banks were to act as a&#13;
A review of six recent private power projects in Pakistan showed that ECA financing ranged from 20% to 47% with&#13;
an average of 34%. The situation for Sri Lanka is expected to be similar.&#13;

of having a commercial bank manage on a fee basis or contract base was explored. Possible&#13;
conflict of interest with existing large customers and the involvement with public sector funds&#13;
were cited as reasons why this type of arrangement was not appealing to the private banking&#13;
sector.&#13;
E. The Long-Term Debt Facility&#13;
3.9    Organizational Structure. PSIDC was incorporated as a public company in August&#13;
1995. It will be the executing agency for the project on behalf of GOSL. PSDIC will have&#13;
available IDA and other donor funds, received from GOSL, to place in financially and&#13;
economically viable infrastructure subprojects. PSIDC has the responsibility to identify.&#13;
evaluate, approve and supervise suitable subprojects as set out in its Articles of Incorporation.&#13;
PSIDC has been incorporated with a nominal share capital basis of 2,000 SLRs. All shares of&#13;
PSIDC are held in trust for GOSL; the Secretary of Finance is the majority shareholder with 70&#13;
percent of the shares. Decisions on the allocation of PSIDC loans will be vested in the Board of&#13;
Directors, who are appointed by GOSL, and would be taken in accordance with criteria agreed&#13;
by IDA. Following approval by PSIDC and subsequently by IDA, PSIDC will enter into a&#13;
subproject loan agreement with, and make loan funds available to, the sub-borrower. Funds&#13;
designated for use as long-term subordinated debt and their repayment will be maintained in an&#13;
account at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (the Fund account). This account will be independent&#13;
from PSIDC's operating account (OP a/c) which will be established only for meeting its day-to-&#13;
day operating requirements. In accordance with normal practice, Government entities have the&#13;
right to operate accounts with the Central Bank. PSIDC is expected to follow this practice and&#13;
the Fund account is recommended to be housed in the Central Bank. The Central Bank has no&#13;
special oversight functions with respect to the account.&#13;
3.10   The Board of Directors of PSIDC currently has a majority of non-civil servant directors.&#13;
The GOSL confirmed that it will maintain this policy of a majority of non-civil directors over the&#13;
life of the company. This will help insure the autonomy and creditability of the PSIDC in&#13;
dealing with the international and local private sector. PSIDC's General Manager will serve as&#13;
the Secretary of the Board of Company. The duties, legal authority and obligations of the&#13;
Company have been set out in the draft of the subsidiary loan agreement (SLA) between GOSL&#13;
and PSIDC. As a condition of effectiveness of the Credit, GOSL will enter into a legally binding&#13;
SLA with the PSIDC that is satisfactory to IDA. Further, GOSL agreed that the operating&#13;
procedures of the PSIDC will be set out in the SLA in such a way as to assure PSIDC's&#13;
autonomy and give it the ability to function on a commercial basis. The procedures for staffing&#13;
and for staff benefits are therefore expected to be comparable to existing private sector financial&#13;
institutions currently operating in Sri Lanka. It was agreed at negotiations that this would be&#13;
accomplished by September 15, 1996.&#13;
3.11   The financial resources managed under PSIDC will be supplemental to those existing&#13;
resources available to Sri Lanka. PSIDC will work closely with sub-borrowers to make the most&#13;
of traditional sources of project finance. Sub-borrowers will be encouraged to maximize the use&#13;
of export credits and seek the assistance of IFC, the MIGA, ADB's private sector wing, the&#13;
CDC and other similar purpose institutions when putting together the funding package for&#13;
proposed projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
3.12   PSIDC's operations will be directed by the General Manager with a small staff which&#13;
initially will include a financial analyst, an accountant and an infrastructure project specialist.&#13;
These professionals will be supported by consultants hired on a retainer basis to assist in legal,&#13;
technical, financial and environmental aspects of subproject evaluation and financial risk&#13;
assessment. Normally, reputable international firms with extensive experience from private&#13;
sector infrastructure projects would be employed. The Manager will be supported by a long-&#13;
term resident advisor who will help coordinate all activities and identify the need for the short-&#13;
term subject specialists. Loan disbursements and collections will be handled by accounting&#13;
experts within PSIDC. The Government agreed that the evaluation of the proposals for the&#13;
shortlisted consultants would be completed by September 1, 1996, and the award of this contract&#13;
would be accomplished by October 1, 1996. The long-term advisor is expected to be in place by&#13;
January 1997.&#13;
3.13   Subproject Eligibiity Criteria. Subproject processing will be carried out by PSIDC's&#13;
General Manager and his staff under the overall direction and control of the Board of Directors.&#13;
PSIDC will approve subprojects for financing only after ensuring that the proposals are&#13;
consistent with Sri Lanka's national priorities. In particular, PSIDC would ensure that policy and&#13;
regulatory frameworks for private sector participation that would take account of end user&#13;
benefits would be in place.8 The subprojects will meet technical, economic, financial and&#13;
environmental viability criteria and national or IDA environmental standards (including criteria&#13;
for involuntary resettlement, should it arise) in case of IDA-supported subprojects.9 Ordinarily&#13;
the question of a subproject being compatible with national planning priorities will be examined&#13;
by the line ministries and BID before being recommended for financing. In fact the Letter of&#13;
Intent (LOI) issued by GOSL, which forms the basis of the project financing, implies that the&#13;
subproject has met all national criteria. However, it is still incumbent on PSIDC to examine the&#13;
proposed private sector subproject in this regard. The subproject eligibility criteria that have&#13;
been agreed to by Government for projects to be financed by PSIDC are set out in Box 3.&#13;
3.14   Subproject Approval Procedures. PSIDC has two points for project approval. Early on&#13;
in the process, the subproject sponsor submits a loan application to PSIDC. At this time the GM&#13;
will carry out a preliminary assessment to ascertain if the subproject is likely to meet the&#13;
eligibility criteria for PSIDC funding. This early vetting will be done is association with IDA.&#13;
As the subproject develops, PSIDC's staff will prepare an appraisal report. To assist with these&#13;
due diligence processes, PSIDC will employ reputable international legal, financial,&#13;
environmental and technical consultants. At this time, the PSIDC will be involved with the&#13;
detailed discussions of the Security Package (SP). During negotiations, the Government agreed&#13;
to the generic conceptual framework as described in the SP for the undertaking of privately&#13;
supported subprojects in the infrastructure sector.  The appraisal report, along with a&#13;
recommendation to make a loan, will be forwarded by the General Manager to the Board of&#13;
Directors, who will be responsible for sub-loan approvals. In order to ensure that the subprojects&#13;
meet IDA's requirements regarding quality and viability, the appraisal report prepared by PSIDC&#13;
will be reviewed and approved by IDA. IDA's approval is a condition of disbursement of the&#13;
sub-loans. Once the recommendation of a sub-loan is accepted, the General Manager and staff,&#13;
including consultants, will be responsible for loan documentation and negotiation, as well as&#13;
Table 2 sets out a list of regulatory and policy frameworks at various stages of preparation for different subsectors.&#13;
See Annexes 5 and 6 on the Environment and Social Assessment Framework for the project.&#13;

supervision, monitoring and fulfilling reporting and auditing requirements.  The sub-loan&#13;
approval process is set out in Box 4.&#13;
Box 3: Subproject Eligibility Criteria&#13;
*: GOSL 's Priority Plan: Public and private sector investments should form an integral&#13;
part of the priority plan for the relevant subsector. This would also ensure that&#13;
public and private investments are complementary.&#13;
*  Regulatory and Policy Framework: Policy and regulatory frameworks for private&#13;
sector participation that adequately protect benefits to end users should be in place:&#13;
before subproject approval.&#13;
*  Uset of Proven Technologies: The technology proposed for a project should have a&#13;
track record of demonstrated success in countries at a similar level of technological&#13;
development and infrastructure support, as in Sri Lanka.&#13;
*  Viability: Sponsors should possess a proven capability to develop, finance and&#13;
operate the infrastructure projects in countries at a similar level of development as&#13;
Sri Lanka. To ensure commitment, sponsors equity would need to represent at least&#13;
20 percent of the project cost with the main project sponsors holding a minimum of&#13;
35 percent of the equity for at least five years after start up of commercial&#13;
operations.&#13;
* Limited Recourse Financing: Private investors and lenders should not require direct.&#13;
sovereign guarantees. Lenders should rely on the security package (see Annex 2),&#13;
future cash flows from the project and the value of the assets for comfort. The debt;&#13;
financing must include some portion of non-recourse commercial senior debt.&#13;
PSIDC will not cover more than 40 percent of the project's total costs.&#13;
* Economic Rate of Return: The economic rate of return will exceed 12 percent and,&#13;
where applicable, the subprojects will form part of the least-cost development plan.&#13;
*  Environment and Social Assessment Criteria: All projects will necessarily meet&#13;
GOSL's environmental and social assessment criteria as set: out in the National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan as well as IDA's environmental and social assessment;;&#13;
guidelines.&#13;

F. Financial Arrangements&#13;
3.15   Lenuding Tern,. GOSL will pass through all credits from donors to PSIDC on the same&#13;
terms as the original credit. Thus, IDA funds placed in PSIDC would carry an interest rate of&#13;
0.75 percent per annum and a maturity rate of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years.&#13;
However, the loans to PSIDC would be denominated in US dollars and, in the case of the IDA&#13;
credit, GOSL would take the SDR - US dollar exchange rate risk (see para. 3.22-3.23). PSIDC&#13;
will provide debt to sub-borrowers in US dollars and will arrange for loan maturity periods not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
exceeding 22 years, including a grace period of up to 8 years. Maturities and grace periods will&#13;
be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the nature of the subproject. Interest&#13;
during construction would be capitalized and form part of the financing provided by PSIDC to&#13;
subprojects. In order to protect PSIDC's cash position during the start-up period, the loan from&#13;
GOSL to PSIDC would have a five-year moratorium on the payment of interest.&#13;
Box 4: Sub-Loan Approval Process&#13;
Summary&#13;
*  GOSL issues a Letter of Intent (LOI) to the selected Private Project Company.&#13;
.  The Private Project Company submits a Loan Application to PSIDC together with the Loan&#13;
Application Fee.&#13;
*  The General Manager (GM), in collaboration with IDA, will carry out a preliminary assessment&#13;
based on the information received in order to ascertain the eligibility of the subproject by PSIDC.&#13;
.  The GM will submit a recommendation to the Board of Directors to accept the loan applications&#13;
and for the authorization to commence negotiations.&#13;
.  If the Board of Directors clears the operation, the GM will issue a Preliminary Acceptance Letter&#13;
(PAL) to the Private Project Company including a draft-term sheet and sub-loan agreement.&#13;
.  The Private Project Company will convey their acceptance of the PAL and deposit the Sub-loan&#13;
Appraisal Fee&#13;
.  If the proposal was unsolicited, the Private Project Company will complete the project's&#13;
Feasibility Study in accordance with the LOI and the PAL.&#13;
*  The GM, supported by consultants, will participate in the negotiations of the Security Package&#13;
(SP) with the Private Project Company.&#13;
*  At the same time, preliminary negotiations of the Sub-loan Agreement will take place and be&#13;
evaluated by the GM, supported by consultants.&#13;
.  Once the SP is initiated, the GM will undertake the subproject appraisal and prepare an Appraisal&#13;
Report including Due Diligence.&#13;
.  The GM will seek approval of the loan by the Board of Directors.&#13;
&#149;  The GM will send the Appraisal Report, Draft Sub-loan Agreement and Engineering,&#13;
Procurement Construction (EPC) contract (if needed) to IDA for concurrent approval by the&#13;
Board of Directors.&#13;
*  The GM will finalize negotiations of the Sub-loan Agreement with the Private Project Company.&#13;
*  The GM will sign the Sub-loan Agreement with the Private Project Company.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-1 8-&#13;
3.16   The determination of initial lending rates has been led to a large extent by the limited&#13;
market for long-term lending in Sri Lanka at present. A variable rate option has been determined&#13;
on the basis of IFC's proposed lending rate for US dollar debt, which is 6 month US$&#13;
LIBOR+250 basis points for a term of 10-15 years, for an independent power project in Sri&#13;
Lanka. In the case of PSIDC, a premium of 50 basis points has been added to reflect the&#13;
subordinate nature of the lending. The variable-rate basis has been discussed with international&#13;
bankers in Sri Lanka who concur that the pricing of PSIDC's proposed lending rate appears to&#13;
be appropriate for attracting equity and commercial debt resources.&#13;
3.17   In view  of the rigid end-use tariff structure in most sectors in Sri Lanka, most&#13;
infrastructure project sponsors also desire a fixed-rate interest option for PSIDC debt. The fixed&#13;
rate being proposed for PSIDC is based on the prevailing rates for swaps between variable and&#13;
fixed interest rates on US dollar debt at the time of subproject loan negotiation. A premium of&#13;
300 basis points would be charged as additional premium to reflect country risk.10 The borrower&#13;
would have a choice between the variable and fixed-rate options at the time of negotiating the&#13;
loan. IDA and GOSL would retain oversight on loan decisions and lending terms and would revisit&#13;
offered rates annually. To summarize, the two options available to the subproject borrower are:&#13;
Variable interest rates based on 6 month lJS$ LIBOR, plus a premium of 3&#13;
percent (LIBOR+ 3 %).&#13;
Fixed interest rates based on the term of the loan and the market swap rate between&#13;
variable and fixed interest rates for US$ debt at the time of subproject loan negotiation,&#13;
plus a premium of 3 percent.&#13;
3.18   Fesc,  It is envisaged that the recurrent management costs of PSIDC shall be partly&#13;
covered by fees charged from borrowers. The proposed fee structurel l is as follows:&#13;
*  one time loan application fee of US$5,000;&#13;
*  documentation fee of 0.50 percent of the loan amount, subject to a maximum of&#13;
US$300,000 plus out-of-pocket costs of international travel and fees for consultants&#13;
employed for the due diligence process;&#13;
*  commitment fee of 0.75 percent of the committed funds; and&#13;
*  project monitoring fee of 0.25 percent of the yearly outstanding balances, subject to&#13;
a ceiling of US$50,000 per annum plus out of pocket costs.&#13;
3.19    Nature and Extent of Spread Income and its Deployment  Credits from IDA to GOSL&#13;
carry a service charge of 0.75 percent per annum and a term of 40 years with ten years grace.&#13;
These terms are passed on to the Company. However PSIDC places debt at significantly higher&#13;
rates, for maturities varying between 15-22 years and a maximum grace period of eight years.&#13;
The differences between the funding and placement terms of PSIDC will result in cash surplus in&#13;
the Fund account over time. Indicative financial projections show that, with an initial&#13;
capitalization of US$70 million, accumulated interest spread reserves are upwards of US$ 9&#13;
The lending spread over LIBOR would be reviewed annually for new subprojects in order to reflect changing market&#13;
conditions.&#13;
The fee structure will be based on commercial practices and market rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
million in year 6. In addition to interest spread, the difference in the maturity and grace periods&#13;
of loans placed by PSIDC and the credit from IDA to GOSL also leads to cash retention in the&#13;
Fund account. The principal repayments on the project loans placed by PSIDC commence from&#13;
year 8 onwards. The accumulated surplus in PSIDC available for placement would be around&#13;
US$25 million in year 8 and over US$40 million by year 10. The income resulting from interest&#13;
spread and the amounts arising from principal retention would be partly deployed to cover&#13;
operating expenses and for financing other new projects. The resulting surplus can be used to&#13;
finance up to 40 percent of costs for new projects. Thus, additional projects of about US$100&#13;
million could again be financed by PSIDC by the tenth year. (Full details are set out in Annex&#13;
4.) During negotiations, the Government agreed to the above lending arrangements including&#13;
lending rates, fees, grace periods, and maturities. It was also agreed that PSIDC will carry out a&#13;
review of these lending terms and conditions each year and adjust the terms and conditions for&#13;
new loans in line with market based criteria. During negotiations, it was also confirmed that the&#13;
main purpose of retaining the spread income within PSIDC was to support future lending for&#13;
infrastructure projects. Operating expenses of PSIDC would also be supported from the spread&#13;
income and PSIDC Board will approve this allocation through the operating budget of the&#13;
PSIDC. This mechanism will be set out in the SLA as part of the operating procedures of the&#13;
PSIDC.&#13;
3.20   Future of PSIDC. PSIDC is a single purpose Company which will act as a catalyst in&#13;
promoting private sector sponsored projects.  PSIDC has been designed as a transitory&#13;
mechanism, and not a permanent institutioni. PSIDC's role as a lender will continue only as long&#13;
as the international capital markets are still unable to meet Sri Lanka's requirements for long&#13;
term finance for infrastructure projects. During negotiations, it was agreed that a plan would be&#13;
prepared by GOSL jointly with IDA for the future of PSIDC during the closing months of the&#13;
project, i.e., before June 2002. This would include the provisions for a range of options for&#13;
PSIDC, including restructuring, privatization, as well as closure. The future of PSIDC as a&#13;
lender will be determined on the basis of: (a) GOSL and IDA agreeing that there is no further&#13;
need for such a lending mechanism; or (b) when Sri Lanka achieves a sovereign investment&#13;
grade rating from an internationally recognized credit rating agency and keeps this rating for at&#13;
least two years. The latter would establish a bencihmark for the winding down and closure of&#13;
PSIDC as a lender as such a credit rating would imply that projects could secure long-term credit&#13;
in a commercial basis without PSIDC's support.&#13;
3.21   Foreign Exchange Implications. Foreign exchange risk implications arise primarily&#13;
from the transactions occurring between PSIDC and the sub-borrower. The subproject revenue&#13;
streams will most likely be in local currency, whereas the debt service to PSIDC will be in US$&#13;
(rupee dollar equivalent).  In typical project finance transactions, the sub-borrower project&#13;
company would be able to mitigate a part of the risk arising from this situation through currency&#13;
depreciation pass-throughs in the offtake agreements. It is expected that the sub-borrowers&#13;
would mitigate the exchange-rate risks, especially during construction, through hedging and/or&#13;
exchange rate insurance which would be included in the rate or tariff base. Thus, ultimately it is&#13;
expected that the buyers/customers who carry the cost associated with the exchange rate. In&#13;
principle, the exchange rate risk would be the responsibility of the sub-borrower.&#13;
3.22   There are exchange-rate risk implications for GOSL and IDA as well. Although the&#13;
lending and repayment currency for PSIDC is US dollars (rupee dollar equivalent), as is the&#13;
currency of repayment to GOSL, the obligations of GOSL to IDA are denominated in SDRs and&#13;
repaid in dollars by GOSL. Risks arising from an adverse movement of the dollar against SDRs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
are normally bome by the borrowing government, in this case GOSL. Given the wide spread&#13;
between lending rates to the sub-borrowers and the IDA lending rate and the closure of PSIDC&#13;
after 10 years when principal repayments to IDA would start, GOSL would have ample revenues&#13;
to compensate for this rather modest risk.&#13;
G. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
3.23   The facility would initially be funded with part of the IDA credit amounting to US$70&#13;
million and a KfW credit of approximately US$14 million.  Because no subprojects are at a&#13;
stage where they require financing under this facility, the figures presented below are&#13;
preliminary and illustrative. However, based on Bank experience in the region, the facility, as&#13;
initially funded, is expected to leverage an additional US$141 million in private sector&#13;
investment, both foreign and local, in the form of debt and equity. Therefore, the estimated costs&#13;
of the subprojects are expected to be approximately US$225 million. Both a project cost and&#13;
indicative financing plan are presented below.&#13;

H. Project Implementation and Supervision Strategy&#13;
3.24   PSIDP is an umbrella project, under which infrastructure subprojects from a variety of&#13;
subsectors will seek financing in the form of long-term subordinated loans. This two tiered&#13;
structure predicates that project implementation will have two separate phases. Phase I will be&#13;
the setting up of PSIDC, the appointment of the staff, the Resident Advisor and supporting&#13;
consultants, the compiling of the Company Brochure and the preparation of the operating&#13;
manuals. Phase 11 of project implementation is the placement of PSIDC loans in subprojects.&#13;
(Annex 1 I-A  sets out the Implementation Plan  and Annex I I-B sets out the Supervision&#13;
Strategy).&#13;
3.25   The project management will be undertaken by the General Manager and staff of PSIDC&#13;
with the assistance of consultant advisors. The General Manager will be responsible for the&#13;
preparation of the company brochure and the operations manual(s) for PSIDC. The preparation&#13;
of the company brochure and operation manual(s) will be a condition of disbursements for the&#13;
sub-loan component.&#13;
3.26   The implementation of the project, that is the placement of loans in subprojects, will be&#13;
undertaken by the General Manager and the PSIDC staff.. For each subproject, the reporting&#13;
package will include the appraisal report, quarterly progress reports and annual audited financial&#13;
statements. A Project Completion Report (PCR) will be required following the completion of&#13;
each subproject.  Supervision by IDA will be most critical during the initial loan application&#13;
approval process and during the negotiation of the sub-loan agreements at the following points in&#13;
the loan application and processing schedule:&#13;
*      Submission of the subproject loan application to PSIDC;&#13;
*      The subproject loan application will include the statutory GOSL and IDA/World&#13;
Bank environmental clearances before processing; and&#13;
*      Submission of the final draft of the subproject appraisal report and loan&#13;
documentation to which is attached the conditions offered to the sub-borrower.&#13;
3.27   IDA appreciated the statutory requirement of the Auditor General to audit the accounts&#13;
of the PSIDC, however the government agreed during negotiations that due to the complex&#13;
nature of the sub-project accounts and foreign exchange implications, the PSIDC will also&#13;
appoint an independent external auditors in consultation with IDA, and with the concurrence of&#13;
the Auditor General to provide annual audited financial statements. The audited accounts of the&#13;
PSIDC will be presented no later than four months after the end of each financial year. The&#13;
GOSL has agreed that the PSIDC will also furnish to IDA a quarterly progress report in a form&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. In addition the Government agreed that a mid-term review would be&#13;
undertaken to review the implementation of the project, jointly with IDA, by June 1999 and that&#13;
an operations plan that will include an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be&#13;
prepared within six months after the closing date of the proposed project on June 30, 2002.&#13;
3.28   During the first phase of the project--during which operating manuals for PSIDC are&#13;
written, staff is hired and formal reporting and accounting procedures are being established--IDA&#13;
supervision will concentrate primarily on institutional arrangements, ensuring that the proper&#13;
operating framework and environment is set to facilitate a subproject lending program. Once&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
this is in place the supervision of PSIDC's arrangements will focus on the effectiveness of the&#13;
institution in meeting the needs of the market, to ensure the design in practice actually functions&#13;
as envisaged. Part of the supervision will address the development impact of the project in terms&#13;
of the adequacy of policy frameworks for private sector participation that will ensure end user&#13;
beniefits in subprojects. Phase two of the supervision component would essentially review the&#13;
implementation of specific subprojects financed by PSIDC under a two stage process. The first&#13;
stage will largely focus on the subprojects and PSIDC's review of the loan applications and&#13;
subproject appraisals. This review will include an examination by IDA of the subprojects in&#13;
terms of environment, resettlemenit, procurement, economic viability, consistency with IDA's&#13;
subsector strategy, etc. The second stage of the supervision will focus largely on the subprojects&#13;
in PSIDC's loan portfolio. It will include a review of the timeliness and quality of subproject&#13;
implementation,  compliance  with  standards  specified  for  construction,  procurement,&#13;
environment and resettlement, and operations and maintenalce. PSIDC would be required to&#13;
employ technical advisors for in-depth monitoring of the subproject implementation. These&#13;
technical advisors would, inter alia, ensure that the subprojects are being constructed in&#13;
accordance with agreed international standards and that progress payments and associated&#13;
PSIDC disbursements reflect actual progress. In order not to duplicate efforts, PSIDC and the&#13;
senior lenders can employ the same advisors. The reports of these advisors would be forwarded&#13;
to IDA and provide important input into IDA's own supervision efforts. IDA's staff input for&#13;
supervision is expected to average about 20 staff-weeks per year. Ways will be sought to&#13;
augment these resources throughi use of co-finianicier resources and project technical assistance.&#13;
IV. THE SUBPROJECTS&#13;
A. GOSL's Subproject Pipeliie&#13;
4.1    At present GOSL, in association with the Iine ministries and SIDI, has developed a&#13;
pipeline of projects that are potential candidates for private sector sponsorship. These&#13;
subprojects illustrate GOSL's desire for broad based private sector participation in infrastructure&#13;
development rather than constitutling a specific lending pipeline endorsed by IDA or PSIDC.&#13;
Total value of these projects over the near term, to the year 2001, is over US$600 million and&#13;
range in size from about US$10 million to US$200 million. Four major areas of infrastructure&#13;
development--power, toll roads, ports and urban services (water, wastewater and solid waste)--&#13;
are expected to dominate potential private sector investments financed through PSIDC.&#13;
Subprojects described in this section are possible candidates for PSIDC financing. Until&#13;
appraisals have been undertaken that meet IDA's requirements, subprojects will not be eligible&#13;
for PSIDC funding.&#13;
4.2    As more fully discussed below, some of the power subprojects are expected to&#13;
materialize early, as might also be the case for a ports operation. Subprojects in other sectors are&#13;
likely to take one or two years before they reach financial closure. This assessment is consistent&#13;
with international experience. However, projects in the water, wastewater and roads subsectors&#13;
are generally seen by private investors and lenders as more risky and more difficult to finance.&#13;
Thus, in these cases PSIDC's financing facility can play an important catalytic role in giving&#13;
both GOSL agencies and private sponsors increased confidence that financing will be available&#13;
for soundly structured and economically attractive infrastructure projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
4.3    Po     There is a growing demand for electricity; failure to provide a reliable supply&#13;
will act as a deterrent to potential investors and a constraint on economic development. At&#13;
present levels of coverage, CEB estimates an annual eight to ten percent rate of demand growth&#13;
for power. Most of the demand is spurred by industrial expansion in the vicinity of Colombo. In&#13;
the near term, it is this market that is likely to provide the basis for thermal capacity expansion.&#13;
4.4   In terms of capacity, there is an immediate need to establish 200 MW by 1997/98 and an&#13;
additional 300 MW by the year 2000. A further 1,000 MW of thermal capacity will be required&#13;
by the year 2010. Apart from some small and mini hydro-projects, new hydro capacity needed&#13;
over the next 20 years is at an advanced planining stage, and a potential willingness to finance&#13;
these projects has been expressed by some of the traditional donor agencies. Thermal projects,&#13;
on the other hand, represent an important long-term opportunity for private participation in the&#13;
power sector. The Government and CEB have clearly indicated a preference for establishing new&#13;
thennal capacity in the private sector.&#13;
4.5    At the present time, a number of solicited and unsolicited proposals in the power&#13;
subsector are under active consideration and/or negotiation. An unsolicited bid for a 51 MW&#13;
diesel thermal plant near Colombo (thie KHD project) has been approved, and the project&#13;
agreement was concluded in December 1995. IFC has been closely involved in developing and&#13;
negotiating the project and is expected to finance debt and equity. The sponsors of the project&#13;
have also expressed an interest in exploring PSIDC funding for the project. Furthermore, bids&#13;
for a group of nine mini-hydro projects totaling 51 MW were solicited and concessions have&#13;
been awarded to two sponsors: Biwater Hydro for seven of the projects and Stothert Power for&#13;
the remaining two. The sponsors are presently in the process of developing the projects;&#13;
feasibility studies prepared by the sponsors are under review by CEB. Both groups of sponsors&#13;
have expressed a desire for PSIDC funding. CEB has recently issued a request for proposal for a&#13;
150 MW oil-fired combined cycle power plant, to be located near Colombo. Bids closed on&#13;
January 26, 1996. It is understood that a number of internationally reputed sponsors have&#13;
submitted bids. Evaluations of the proposals are being carried out by SIDI and CEB.&#13;
4.6    Toll Roads. The Road Development Authority (RDA) has ambitious plans for 400 km&#13;
of new highways at a cost of $600 million. They include the Airport Expressway (Colombo to&#13;
Katunayake), the Southern Highway to Galle and Matara and the Outer Circular Highway to&#13;
Colombo. The economic merit of these roads has still to be fully determined. Furthermore, it is&#13;
unlikely that any new road development could be financed by tolls alone, but such projects could&#13;
be attractive to the private sector if some elements of real estate development were included. The&#13;
Airport Expressway appears to be economically viable and is probably the project which would&#13;
be the most interesting for developers on a BOT basis. A feasibility study for this project is&#13;
being undertaken by RDA, as a prelude to its possible solicitation on a BOT basis.&#13;
4.7   paris. Based on experience elsewhere in Asia, the port sector is viewed as a strong&#13;
candidate for private sector participation. There are plans to further develop the capacity and&#13;
facilities at the Port of Colombo. BOT proposals were invited to refurbish and increase the&#13;
capacity of the Queen Elizabeth Quay from 350,000 TEUs (twenty feet equivalent units) to&#13;
1,000,000 TEUs. The bids are presently being evaluated. Proposals for bunkering facilities and&#13;
inland container depots are also under development.&#13;
4.8    Requests for proposals were also invited for new construction and operation of container&#13;
terminals in the Galle port, and the bids received are being evaluated. The Government views&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
the development of Galle Port in the Southern Province as a way to relieve Colombo's&#13;
congestion and stimulate badly needed economic activity in the south, but major investments by&#13;
SLPA  are needed in breakwater construction and dredging before the private sector will&#13;
seriously consider a BOT arrangement for capacity improvements and a transshipment terminal&#13;
for the port. Total public and private project cost for the Port of Galle is US$600 million. IDA is&#13;
currently in discussion with GOSL about providing support for a port optimization study that&#13;
would establish a rational basis for a national port investment strategy over the medium term.&#13;
4.9    Urban Servs. The opportunities for private sector provision of water supply will be&#13;
restricted to Greater Colombo for the time being because of the current low domestic tariffs&#13;
levels and limited commercial/industrial base in other areas. The average tariff levied by&#13;
NWSDB is about half the average cost of supply. NWSDB is able to perform financially due to&#13;
a government grant that supports about 50% of its investmenit requirements. Furthermore, much&#13;
of the funding is on a concessionary basis. Until major sector reforms are implemented and&#13;
tariffs are set at appropriate levels to ensure cost recovery,  some form  of public/private&#13;
partnership will be the principal mechanism  for involving the private sector.  Under the&#13;
continuing program of assistance to the sector, IDA is exploring options with GOSL and&#13;
NWSDB to delink Greater Colombo from NWSDB's operatioiial jurisdiction and to encourage&#13;
the provision of water supply and sanitation services by the private sector.&#13;
4.10   Wastewater treatment facilities for industrial estates, where joint facilities are more&#13;
economic than single-user facilities, are possible candidates for private sector financing. Such&#13;
enclave schemes could be built, owned and operated by (transferred to) a private party, who&#13;
would look to the fees charged to the industrial estates for debt repayment and return on equity.&#13;
There are at least six industrial areas in or near Colombo where tills approach could be adopted.&#13;
Two industrial areas, which include the possibility for private sector investment for wastewater&#13;
treatment plants, are the subject of feasibility studies that are financed under the recently&#13;
approved IDA credit for the Greater Colombo Environmental Improvement Project. The total&#13;
cost of these proposed treatment plants is about US$10 million.&#13;
4.11   In addition to the possible projects indicated above, the creation of PSIDC is expected to&#13;
encourage further project candidates.  As an indicative  measure of the scope of PSIDC&#13;
financing, the following table sets out the magnitude of the potential demand for long-term debt&#13;
and the potential amount of this debt that PSIDC could fund, given that this funding is limited to&#13;
40% of the total project costs. With an estimated near-term project pipeline of approximately&#13;
US$600 million, these potential investments could absorb over US$200 million of PSIDC&#13;
funding (see Annex 3). With a present allocation of US$84 million, PSIDC has considerable&#13;
scope for expanding its program. The near-tern private sector investment program (over the&#13;
next six years) could include:&#13;
Sector               Total Cost (US$ million)    From  PSIDC  (assume&#13;
40% of cost provided)&#13;

B. Environmental and Social Impact Requirements and Economic Analysis for Subpro.ects&#13;
4.12   Environmental and Social Impact Requirements. No specific subprojects have as yet&#13;
been identified for PSIDC financing under the credit. Thus no specific Environmental&#13;
Assessments (EA) is available. However, most larger-scale infrastructure projects that would be&#13;
funded by PSIDC are expected to have a category "A" rating under the Bank's Operational&#13;
Directive (OD) for environmental screening (OD 4.01 and BP 17.50). Thus, the operation has&#13;
been given  an  "A" rating, and an Environmental Assessment Process Document'3 was&#13;
distributed to the Executive Directors on December 14, 1995. This summary sets out the&#13;
framework for environmental clearance in Sri Lanka and the policies and procedures that would&#13;
be followed for subprojects to be financed under the credit. Any subproject that would involve&#13;
IDA funding through PSIDC would need to meet the Bank's environmental guidelines. Annex 5,&#13;
which is part of the Environmental and Social Assessment Framework for the project, sets out an&#13;
outline of the requirements and process for environmental clearances that would need to be met&#13;
for each subproject. An EA satisfactory to IDA would be required to enable the loan application&#13;
from the sub-borrower to PSIDC to proceed. Likewise, all subprojects that entail acquisition of&#13;
private property (legally owned or customarily used) will be required to assess their impact on&#13;
people living in the affected areas. This impact assessment will be carried out as an integral part&#13;
of the EA. When applicable, it would meet the requirements for involuntary resettlement as set&#13;
out in the Bank's Operational Directives (OD 4.30). Annex 6 elaborates on the current part of the&#13;
Environmental and Social Assessment Framework that applies to involuntary resettlement.&#13;
Specific requirements for the EA as it is applied to subprojects would be set out in the&#13;
operational manuals of PSIDC. The consortium of consultants, that are accessed through the&#13;
supporting TA by the General Manger of PSIDC for project evaluation, will also include a&#13;
strong, internationally recognized firm of environmental and resettlement specialists.&#13;
4.13   All subprojects, both solicited and unsolicited, are legally required to have an EA under&#13;
the amended National Environment Act (NEA) of 1993. Detailed resettlement plans will be part&#13;
of the EA as mandated under NEA regulations. Under these provisions, line agencies and&#13;
ministries are designated as Project Approving Agencies (PAA). The Central Environmental&#13;
Authority (CEA) appoints a PAA who has the authority over the project as the agency&#13;
responsible for drafting the terms of reference (TOR) of the EA and chairing the meeting of&#13;
experts who evaluate the EA. The EA is undertaken by the private sponsor under the direction of&#13;
the PAA's TOR. EA approval is contingent uppn public consultation and a positive response of&#13;
the Technical Evaluation Committee approved by the CEA. These processes would need to be&#13;
completed before securing GOSL approval and before any subproject is approved for financing&#13;
by PSIDC.  During this process provision will be made for supervision of the agreed&#13;
environmental standards during subproject implementation and operation.14  For those projects&#13;

SecM95 1255&#13;
4 The project will take advantage of the work of the IDA Environmental Action I Project (under preparation) which&#13;
seeks to establish appropriate standards for environmental due diligence, revamp existing environmental laws and&#13;
regulations, and build capacity in environmental and related institutions (mainly CEA) for preparing and&#13;
implementing environmental assessments and carrying out effective enforcement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
where the line ministries take advantage of the project preparation TA provision in the credit, the&#13;
EA would be designed according to IDA requirements.&#13;
4.14   Economic Analysis. The economic analysis of the project will be carried out at the&#13;
subproject level, on a case-by-case basis. As indicated earlier in the subproject eligibility&#13;
criteria, the minimum acceptable economic rate of return is in excess of 12 percent for a&#13;
subproject and this is considered consistent with other IDA funded projects in Sri Lanka. The&#13;
methodology that would need to be followed to prepare the economic analysis for the subprojects&#13;
will be set out in the operating manuals of the PSIDC. This analysis would include: (a) the&#13;
consistency of the subproject with the priority plans of the subsector; (b) the existence of suitable&#13;
policy and regulatory frameworks that will enable final consumers to benefit from private sector&#13;
efficiencies, (c) valuation of economic benefits and costs using appropriate economic pricing,&#13;
and (d) identification of the risks of the subproject and the associated mitigation measures. The&#13;
economic analysis will be part of the PSIDC's subloan appraisal documentation and will be&#13;
approved by IDA.&#13;
C. Procurement and Disbursements&#13;
4.15   Procurement for Subprojects.  Where PSIDC is financing the cost of a subproject&#13;
procured under the BOO/BOT arrangement, two procurement procedures could be used. In the&#13;
case of a solicited proposal, the investor or project sponsor would be selected under International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) or Limited International Bidding (LIB) procedures acceptable to&#13;
IDA. This procedure would review several factors in order to arrive at the optimal combination&#13;
of evaluation criteria, such as the cost and magnitude of the financing offered, the performance&#13;
specifications of the facility offered, the cost charged to the user or purchaser, other income&#13;
generated by the borrower or purchaser of the facility, and the period of the facility's&#13;
depreciation. The sponsors selected in this manner shall then be free to procure the goods, works&#13;
and services required for the facility from eligible IDA members, using their own procedures. In&#13;
this case, the type of expenditures to be financed shall be specified in the SLA.&#13;
4.16   In case of unsolicited proposals, when the sponsors have not been selected on a&#13;
competitive basis, the goods, works or services required for the subproject and to be financed by&#13;
IDA shall be procured in accordance with ICB or LIB procedures in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
procurement procedures, subject to the exception referred to below. Up to 20 percent of the cost&#13;
of the subproject can be procured with (i) due attention to economy and efficiency, and (ii) in&#13;
accordance with sound commercial practices. Goods, works and services financed from the&#13;
proceeds of loans and mixed credits made by another multilateral agency or a cofinancing&#13;
government would be procured in accordance with the procurement rules and procedures of the&#13;
bilateral agency or the multilateral cofinanciers.  All procurement for civil works, equipment&#13;
and materials undertaken by sub-borrowers for contracts estimated to cost more than&#13;
US$ 1,000,000 would be subject to IDA's prior review.&#13;
4.17   Under limited recourse financing, lenders generally insist that subproject companies&#13;
have access to standby financing to meet any unanticipated financial obligations, and that it is&#13;
available for deployment as needed rather than being tied to specific procurement packages.&#13;
Standbys are provided by the major equity holders and both senior and subordinated lenders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
They are drawn down o0i a pari passu basis irrespective of the cause of the cost overrun with a&#13;
strong economic rationale. If the standby commitments of different lenders were earmarked for&#13;
different project components, the " law of averages" would not apply and the total amount of&#13;
standbys would have to be increased to provide risk protection and which would increase overall&#13;
project financing costs. Furtherimiore, if cost overruns occurred and PSIDC (and IDA) did not&#13;
participate equally in the standby facilities, the commercial lenders would have to finance a&#13;
higher percentage of the project. They would increase the risk premium incorporated in their&#13;
interest rate, so the overall cost of the project would go up, and its viability decrease.&#13;
4.18   Consequently, the provision of standby facilities and the pari passu draw down of these&#13;
facilities arc essential to ensure the overall economy of the project. Failure to do so would&#13;
invariably lead to greater difficulties in mobilizing the total financing and in incurring a higher&#13;
cost of the subprojects financed through PSIDC. The standby financing provided by IDA would&#13;
be disbursed against goods, works and related services. Some of these funds might be disbursed&#13;
against the same items that are covered under the subproject's base financing and which shall&#13;
have been procured strictly under tile Bank's procurement rules. However, because of the&#13;
pooled nature of the standbys, part of the standby financing might cover cost increases on items&#13;
that have not been procuired following the Bank's guidelines. It is proposed that the proceeds of&#13;
the proposed IDA credit be used for such goods and works so long as certain safeguards are&#13;
applied. These safeguards are that the disbursements be for contracts that hlave been awarded:&#13;
(a) in accordance with sound commercial practices; (b) with due attention to economy and&#13;
efficiency; and (c) in accordance with the Bank's eligibility requirements. In addition, such&#13;
disbursements would not be made against goods and services provided by a subproject sponsor&#13;
or shareholder. As a general rule, the maximum percentage of IDA funds eligible for standbys&#13;
for any subproject would not exceed 20%.&#13;
4.19   Proceeds from  the proposed credit would also be used to finance insurance that is&#13;
procured competitively off-shore. This follows limited recourse project finance practices which&#13;
place major emphasis on the identificationi, allocation and mitigation of risks in a transparent&#13;
manner. In order to ensure that the potential proceeds of any claims would be available to the&#13;
lenders and that the cover is adequate, the commercial banks typically insist that the owner&#13;
procures all the insurance for the construction phase (rather than relying on the insurance cover&#13;
normally obtained by contractors and suppliers). To obtain the lowest possible price, insurance&#13;
financed under the proposed credit would be procured through LIB from firms that have the&#13;
highest rating.'1&#13;
4.20   Procurement by PSIDC and Line Agencies.  Consultants would be selected in&#13;
accordance with IDA's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Contract packages for equipment&#13;
and materials costing less than US$30,000 could be procured through local shopping with an&#13;
aggregate of not more than US$250,000. Contracts with consulting firns estimated to cost more&#13;
than US$100,000 and contracts with individual consultants costing more than US$50,000 would&#13;
be subject to prior review.&#13;
Companies should have a Best's Insurance Reports rating of at least "A" or equivalent, have an Insurance Solvency&#13;
International Limited rating of at least "A" or equivalent, or receive the highest financial condition rating of any&#13;
other independent insurer rating organization that issues ratings on not less than five hundred (500) insurers.&#13;

4.21   Disbursements.  Prior to the disbursement of any IDA funds for a subproject, IDA&#13;
would review and approve the followinig documenits:&#13;
*  the appraisal report prepared by PSIDC to ensure that the subproject is technically sound,&#13;
and economically and financially viable;&#13;
*  the procurement documentation to ensure that l[)A's guidelines have been followed;&#13;
*  the environmental assessment, and its applicability to the resettlement action plan; and&#13;
*  the key documents in the security package with special emphasis given to PSIDC sub-loan&#13;
agreement.&#13;
4.22   PSIDC would be the lender of last resort.  Depending on the availability of other&#13;
financing, PSIDC's contribution would vary from case-to-case. Tlhus, disbursement percentages&#13;
would also vary, depending on the contract packaging of the subproject and PSIDC's share of the&#13;
financing. The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed as follows (See Annex 13):&#13;
subprojects competitively awarded after international solicitation:&#13;
(a)    100 percent of EPC contract payments, determined on a case-by-case basis;&#13;
(b)    100 percent of foreign expenditures (ci f. cost) and  local expenditures (ex-&#13;
factory cost) for ancillary equivalent and materials (not included in the EPC&#13;
contract), determined on a case-by-case basis; and&#13;
(c)    100 percent of interest during construction and other charges accrued on the&#13;
amounts of the sub-loans financed out of the proceeds of the credit;&#13;
eligible contracts on other subprojects:&#13;
(a)    100 percent of foreign expenditures and 85 percent of local expenditures for&#13;
works, determined on a case-by-case basis;&#13;
(b)    100 percent of foreign expenditures (c.i.f. cost) and local expenditures (ex-&#13;
factory cost) for equipment and materials, determined on a case-by-case basis;&#13;
(c)    100 percent of foreign expenditures on off-shore insurance, determined on a&#13;
case-by-case basis; and&#13;
(d)    100 percent of interest during construction and other charges accrued on the&#13;
amounts of the sub-loans financed out of the proceeds of the credit;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
technical assistance and institutional strengthening:&#13;
(a)    100 percent of expenditures on consultant services and training;&#13;
(b)    100 percent of foreign expenditure (c.i.f. costs) and local expenditures (ex-&#13;
factory cost) for equipment and materials;&#13;
(c)    70 percent of other items procured locally; and&#13;
(d)    100 percent of incremenital staff costs up to the end of June 1999 and 70 percent&#13;
througih June 30, 2001.&#13;
4.23   The disbursement of funds by the cofinaniciers (if any) would be in accordance with their&#13;
respective guidelines. Disbursement would be fully documented, except for expenditures under&#13;
contracts for goods costing less than US$30,000 equivalent procured for the use of consultants,&#13;
for contracts with consulting firms estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent and&#13;
contracts with individual consultants estimated to cost less than US$50,000. Such disbursements&#13;
would be made against statements of expenditures (SOE), the documentation for which would&#13;
not be submitted to IDA but retained by PSIDC for inspection by the supervision missions. The&#13;
standard procedures for auditing SOEs would apply. In order to expedite disbursements, a&#13;
Special Account would be established in a commercial bank, in accordance with terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA. The initial deposit in the Special Account would be equivalent to&#13;
four months of expected expenditures or about US$400,000. The indicative disbursement&#13;
schedule has been projected to cover a six-year period and is set out in Annex 4. The estimated&#13;
disbursement profile takes into consideration typical subprojects and the indicative composition&#13;
of the portfolio to be financed from the proposed credit.  The cut-off date for new loan&#13;
commitments financed under the credit from PSIDC would be June 30, 2000. The credit closing&#13;
date would be June 30, 2002.&#13;

A. Benefits&#13;
5.1    The proposed project will facilitate the expansion of infrastructure while helping to&#13;
mobilize financial, technical and managerial resources from the private sector. As indicated in&#13;
Chapter 11, additional infrastructure investmenits are essential to the Sri Lankan economy to fully&#13;
realize the benefits of its potential economic growth.  By removing bottlenecks in power,&#13;
transport, water and other infrastructure sectors, the proposed project would facilitate the growth&#13;
of the industrial and commercial activities of the country, and particularly the competitiveness of&#13;
its agriculture and manufactured exports. In the power sector, considerable benefits are expected&#13;
to be derived from the project throughi a reduction of the high economic cost of power shortages&#13;
(estimated in the range of US$0.3-US$0.5/kWh), mainly reflecting losses in the manufacturing&#13;
industry. Similarly, the expansion of transport services and water supply would enhance the&#13;
commercial and industrial activities, including the tourism industry. The proposed project would&#13;
also have a beneficial impact on poor households, not only by stimulating the overall economic&#13;
development, but also by improving reliability of power, access to water supply, transport&#13;
mobility and facilitating growth of new economic activities.&#13;
5.2    Additional benefits are expected to be derived from the involvement of private sector&#13;
technical and managerial expertise. In particular, savings would be achieved by raising the&#13;
efficiency of operation of infrastructure services. Bank and worldwide experience indicates that&#13;
private sector infrastructure participation results in lower costs, higher output, and higher&#13;
reliability of services.  At present, private sector investment interest is increasing, yet the&#13;
inability to finance long-term commercial debt continues to be an impediment to the successful&#13;
initiation of new infrastructure projects. The project would address this financing gap and act as&#13;
a catalyst to realize the private sector investment strategy for infrastructure. The involvement of&#13;
the private sector will provide a positive model for existing and future projects. It would assure&#13;
the quality control of the pipeline of projects identified and supported by GOSL by providing&#13;
autonomy in decision making on projects assisted under PSIDP. This will help to ensure&#13;
transparency in funding decisions.&#13;
5.3    From the macroeconomic point of view, the proposed project would have a positive&#13;
impact in the form of fiscal relief obtained from the decrease in public sector expenditures in&#13;
basic infrastructure.  The project would allow the mobilization of a large portion of the&#13;
infrastructure investment cost outside the budget, since PSIDC would contribute up to 40% of&#13;
the investment cost with the balance provided by the private sector through long-term&#13;
commercial debt and equity. Furthermore, the ability of PSIDC to retain its spread income will&#13;
ensure that the proposed project will be supportable through its own resources. Further all&#13;
subprojects should yield an economic rate of return exceeding 12 percent to comply with IDA&#13;
guidelines for PSIDC.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.4    Prgject Risk,  A clear risk for the project is the slow implementation by the line&#13;
ministries of the policy of private sector participation in infrastructure. This policy has been&#13;
articulated in the establishment of SIDI and has been strengthened in recent policy directives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
which place SIDI under the direct control of the Board of Investment. It has been reinforced&#13;
more recently by the President in her public policy statements, particularly in her recognition&#13;
that infrastructure development is not keeping pace with the accelerated growth of Sri Lanka's&#13;
economy and could prove to be a bottleneck to sustained growth. There is a risk of not enforcing&#13;
this policy due to: (1) natural reluctance of the line ministries to fully embrace private sector&#13;
participation in infrastructure investments; (2) line agencies' preference in seeking the support of&#13;
traditional donor financing and thereby crowding out private sector approaches; (3) the recent&#13;
reorganization of SIDI and its lack of a robust track record; and (4) possible constraints imposed&#13;
by a myriad of government regulations and bureaucratic inertia that might slow down the&#13;
development of sound project proposals and delay financial closure. The incursion of such risks&#13;
would possibly slow down the commitment and disbursement of project funds. The strong&#13;
political support for private infrastructure investments underlined by the increasingly apparent&#13;
infrastructure bottlenecks and significant public debt burden will mitigate against this risk. The&#13;
active leadership of the Public Enterprise Reform Commission as the Board of Directors of&#13;
PSIDC gives the project an enihanced institutional profile, given the recent successes of the&#13;
Commission in privatizing a range of public assets. The recent conclusion of the negotiations&#13;
concerning the 51 MW power plant (IFC supported) and the active pursuit of the concerned line&#13;
agencies of the program to cover various infrastructure enterprises indicate that the traditional&#13;
resistance by the bureaucracy has been overcome.&#13;
5.5    A further risk is that the success of the project relies on the activities and decisions of&#13;
private sector entrepreneurs and investors who are not under the direct influence of IDA.&#13;
Although care will be taken to appraise subprojects to be financed under the Company and pre-&#13;
qualify potential investors, the lead time in negotiating the security arrangements of putting&#13;
together a satisfactory financial package of additional debt financiers and equity partners is long.&#13;
Such development risks experienced by similar private project initiatives have resulted in delays&#13;
in financial closure and commissioning. The long gestation period required in public-private&#13;
projects should be realized since such delays cause increases in costs, lost revenues, and&#13;
consumer dissatisfaction. A number of these risks will be addressed through technical assistance&#13;
with the provision of an experienced long-term advisor and well designed operating criteria for&#13;
PSIDC, and through adequate supervision of the project.  For the latter, a high level of&#13;
supervision resources has been allocated.&#13;
5.6    Su4pEj.c1 Risks.  Subproject risks or risks for individual lending operations under&#13;
PSIDC will be managed under well established principals of risk mitigation for non- or limited-&#13;
recourse projects.  The leading principle of risk allocation is that it is most economically&#13;
efficient to allocate risks to the party that is in the best position to manage and control them. In&#13;
general, political, legal and force-majeure risks are allocated to the Government; commercial,&#13;
market, construction, operation and maintenance risks are allocated to various commercial&#13;
partners. All risks under the subprojects are identified and allocated through the various legal&#13;
agreements and contracts under the security package (See Annex 2). For example, construction&#13;
risks under the project are allocated to the contractor under the turnkey contract; operation and&#13;
maintenance risks are allocated to the operator of the plant under an operation and maintenance&#13;
agreement.&#13;
5.7    During the early years of its operations, PSIDC's assets would be concentrated in one of&#13;
a couple of subprojects, and its reserves would be non-existent or fairly small. The failure of one&#13;
of these subprojects could result in losses for PSIDC that would be passed on to GOSL. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
risk would be partly mitigated through provisions in the Implementation/Concession Agreements&#13;
that would allow GOSL, under certain circumstances, to take over the Company if it failed to&#13;
perform successfully.&#13;
VI. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
Agreements:&#13;
6.1    Agreement has been reached with the Government, as follows:&#13;
(a)   that it will maintain a policy that the PSIDC will have a majority of non-civil&#13;
servant directors over the life of the company (para 3. 10);&#13;
(b)    that the operating procedures as set out in the SLA of the PSIDC will assure&#13;
PSIDC's autonomy and give it the ability to function on a commercial basis. The&#13;
norms for staffing and for staff benefits, therefore, will be comparable to&#13;
existing private sector financial institutions currently operating in Sri Lanka and&#13;
this will be accomplished by September 15, 1996. (para 3.10 );&#13;
(c)   that the evaluation of the proposals of the shortlisted consultants would be&#13;
completed by September 1, 1996, and the award of this contract would be&#13;
accomplished by October 1, 1996 with a view to the long-term advisor being in&#13;
place by January 1997. (para 3.12);&#13;
(d)    on a set of eligibility criteria for approval of subprojects (para 3.13 and Box 3);&#13;
(e)   that the sub-borrower would have a choice between the variable and fixed-rate&#13;
options at the time of negotiation the loan with PSIDC and these options are&#13;
(3.17):&#13;
Variable interest rates based on 6 month US$ LIBOR, plus a&#13;
premium of 3 percent (LIBOR+ 3 %).&#13;
Fixed interest rates based on the term of the loan and the market swap&#13;
rate between variable and fixed interest rates for US$ debt at the time of&#13;
subproject loan negotiation, plus a premium of 3 percent.&#13;
(f)   that the recurrent management costs of the PSIDC would be partly covered by&#13;
fees and the fee structure will be based on commercial principals and market&#13;
rates (para. 3.18)&#13;
(g)   that PSIDC will provide debt maturity periods not exceeding 22 years, including&#13;
a grace period of up to 8 years (3.19).&#13;
(h)   that the main purpose of retaining the spread income within PSIDC was to&#13;
support future lending for infrastructure projects; operating expenses of PSIDC&#13;
would also be supported from the spread income and the PSIDC Board will&#13;
approve this allocation through the operating budget of the PSIDC (para 3.19);&#13;
(i)   that a plan would be prepared by GOSL jointly with IDA for the future of the&#13;
PSIDC during the closing months of the project, i.e. before June 2002, and&#13;
would include the provision that when Sri Lanka achieves a sovereign&#13;
investment grade rating from an internally recognized credit rating agency and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
keeps this rating for at least two years, this would establish a benchmark for the&#13;
winding down and closure of the PSIDC as a lender. ( para 3.20);&#13;
(j)    that a mid-term review would be undertaken to review the implementation of the&#13;
project, jointly with IDA, by June 1999 and an operations plan that would&#13;
include an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be prepared within six&#13;
months after the closing date of the project on June 30, 2002. (para 3.27);&#13;
6.4    Conditions of effectiveness of the Credit will be that:&#13;
(a)    GOSL will hlave entered into a legally binding sub-loan agreement (the&#13;
subsidiary loan agreement) with PSIDC that is satisfactory to the association.&#13;
(b)    KfW loan agreement has been executed and is ready to be declared effective.&#13;
6.5    Conditions of disbursements for the subloan component of the credit will be that:&#13;
(a)    PSIDC will have prepared a brochure and operational manual(s) satisfactory to&#13;
IDA; and&#13;
(b)    IDA will have reviewed and approved each subproject.&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
6.6    With the above assurances, agreements and conditions, the proposed project is suitable&#13;
for an IDA Development Credit of SDR 52.9 million (US$77 million equivalent) on standard&#13;
IDA terms with 40 years maturity to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.&#13;

Private Sector Infrastructure Development Company Ltd.&#13;
1.     The Project   The proposed IDA project seeks to develop a modern and efficient system of&#13;
infrastructure in Sri Lanka by promoting significant participation of the private sector in the investment,&#13;
operation, ownership and maintenance of new infrastructure facilities.  The project would enable&#13;
potential investors to access long-term financing, the lack of which inhibits project development.&#13;
Introduced under the project is a government executing agency, the Private  Sector Infrastructure&#13;
Development Company (PSIDC or Company). The PSIDC is created to provide long-term subordinated&#13;
funds to selected private sector infrastructure projects in conjunction with commercial sources of funds.&#13;
In addition to their own equity contributions, project sponsors and investors would resort to commercial&#13;
banks for the remainder of the project debt. Given the thinness of the commercial debt market in Sri&#13;
Lanka, and based on World Bank experience of other debt funds, providing a source of long-term&#13;
subordinated debt will increase the sponsor's ability to attract non-recourse financing.&#13;
2.     Location and Governance.     A   public  company,  The  Private  Sector  Infrastructure&#13;
Development Company (PSIDC) was incorporated in August 1995. It will be the executing agency for&#13;
the project and will make available funds received from GOSL to viable infrastructure sub-projects.' To&#13;
do this, PSIDC has the mandate and will have the capacity to identify, evaluate and approve suitable sub-&#13;
projects. The mandate has been vested under the Articles of the Company. The PSIDC has a share&#13;
capital of 2,000 Rupees divided into 20 shares of 100 Rupees each, of which 14 are held by the Secretary&#13;
of Finance and the others by individual shareholders, all in trust, for the GOSL. Decisions on the&#13;
allocation of PSIDC funds will be vested with the Board of Directors and would be taken in accordance&#13;
with IDA criteria. Following approval by the PSIDC, and where appropriate by IDA, the PSIDC will&#13;
enter into a sub-project loan agreement with, and make loan funds available to, the sub-borrower. Funds&#13;
designated for use as long term subordinated debt and their repayments will be maintained in an account&#13;
at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Fund Account. This account will be independent from the PSIDC's&#13;
Operating Account.&#13;
3.     Organization and Management. The PSIDC's operations would be managed by a  General&#13;
Manager with a small staff including a financial analyst, an accountant and an infrastructure project&#13;
specialist. These professionals would be supported by short term consultants, mostly likely on retainer, to&#13;
assist in legal, technical, financial, economic and environmental aspects of sub-project evaluation and&#13;
financial risk assessment (see Annex 9). The manager would be supported by a long term resident&#13;
consultant, who would help coordinate all activities and identify the need for short term subject&#13;
specialists. Disbursements and collections would be handled by the accounting expertise within PSIDC.&#13;
In view of the skill mix required for the PSIDC to meet its proposed mandate, it would be necessary to&#13;
seek external expertise.&#13;
4.    The General Manager will have the resources to provide for specific legal, technical, financial,&#13;
economic, and environmental2 short-term  consultants as needed for the appraisal and negotiations,&#13;
supported by a technical assistance component of the proposed IDA credit. The TA requirements are&#13;
The idea of having one of the development banks manage the debt facility was rejected due to potential conflict of interest&#13;
between it's fund management role and its own lending activities. Subprojects under the PSIDC will likely provide&#13;
opportunities for local equity and senior debt investments to complement the foreign funds.&#13;
2 Inclusion of expertise on resettlement issues, as appropriate - See Annex 5 and 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
estimated at about US $ 3.5 million for a 4 to 5 year period. The General Manager would also have&#13;
access to a TA component of US$ 3.5 mission to support project development activities by the line&#13;
agencies to improve preparation of projects that will likely receive subordinated debt from the PSIDC.&#13;
5.   Onlending Terms and Conditions. The PSIDC would be financed through donor resources--IDA,&#13;
and KfW. The initial loan funds of the PSIDC are to be about US$ 84 million. IDA credits made to&#13;
GOSL, to be passed through to the PSIDC, would be accounted for in the consolidated fund like other&#13;
public sector loans. The GOSL would pass through all credits from donors to the PSIDC at the same&#13;
terms as the original credit. Thus, IDA monies placed in PSIDC would carry an interest of 0.75 percent&#13;
per annum and have a maturity of 40 years and 10 years grace. The on-lending of funds to private&#13;
companies would be governed through a subsidiary agreement between PSIDC and the private company.&#13;
Note that for IDA supported sub-projects, the appraisals would be required to follow IDA guidelines on&#13;
environment and procurement and to be submitted to IDA for review. The proceeds of IDA credit will&#13;
be disbursed against expenditures for equipment, material, civil works and services procured under&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
6.     The PSIDC's on-lending to sub-projects would be denominated in US Dollars and would be&#13;
repaid either in US dollars or equivalent SL Rupees. The PSIDC's on-lending interest rates would be&#13;
either variable (6 month US$ LIBOR + 3%) or fixed. The fixed rate would be based on the term of the&#13;
loan requested and the market swap rate plus 3%. The foreign exchange risk vis-a-vis US$ or interest rate&#13;
risk would be assumed by the private borrowers.&#13;
7.    The repayment period for PSIDC's onlending to sub-projects would be no greater than 22 years,&#13;
including a maximum grace period of 8 years. Sub-loans from the Company would cover up to 40% of&#13;
the total project costs and it is expected that at least 20% of the total project cost would be mobilized as&#13;
equity by the project sponsors. Sub-loans from the PSIDC would be fully subordinated to commercial&#13;
loans made to sub-projects.&#13;
8.    The PSIDC Fee Structure. The cost to PSIDC as lender would include the cost of staff, including&#13;
salaries, transport, insurance, etc. These costs for the initial four years would be covered by the TA&#13;
component of the Project.&#13;
PSIDC Fee Structure&#13;
*  Application Fee: US$5,000.00 non-refundable to be submitted at application&#13;
*  Documentation Fee: 0.5% of the loan amount, non-refundable, subject to a maximum of&#13;
US$300,000 plus out of pocket costs of international travel and fees for consultants&#13;
employed for the due diligence process.&#13;
* Commitment Fee: 0.75% per annum of the unutilized loan amount.&#13;
* Project Monitoring Fee: 0.25% of the yearly outstanding, subject to a ceiling of&#13;
US$50,000 per annum plus out of pocket costs.&#13;
9.     The proposed fee structure is in line with fees charged by IDA for its conventional lending&#13;
programs. Preliminary financials, including sources and uses of funds, for the PSIDC is presented in&#13;
Annex 4. The financial analyses have been prepared on the basis of indicative sub-projects representing&#13;
a total disbursement of US$70 million (IDA component of PSIDC financing) over the first six years of&#13;
the Company's operation. The fees charged from borrowers, as per the proposed fee structure above,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
only partially cover the operating costs of the Company. Therefore, in order to be self-sustaining, the&#13;
PSIDC would have to earmark a portion of its interest income toward operating costs.&#13;
Operating Procedures&#13;
10.    Sub Project Eligibility Criteria. Sub-project processing would be carried out by the General&#13;
Manager and his staff under the overall direction and control of the Board of Directors. The PSIDC&#13;
would approve sub-projects for financing only after ensuring that the proposals are consistent with Sri&#13;
Lanka's national priorities. The subprojects would meet technical, economic and financial viability&#13;
criteria and national or IDA environmental standards (including criteria for involuntary resettlement,&#13;
should it arise) in case of IDA supported sub-projects. Details of environment and resettlement criteria&#13;
are set out in Annexes 5 and 6, respectively. The proposed private sector sub-projects are expected to&#13;
fulfill the following criteria:&#13;
Eligibility Criteria&#13;
* GOSL 's Priority Plan: Public and private sector investments should form an integral part of&#13;
the priority plan for the relevant sub-sector. This would also ensure that public and private&#13;
investments are complementary.&#13;
*  Regulatory and Policy Framework: Policy and regulatory frameworks for private sector&#13;
participation that adequately protect benefits to end users should be in place before&#13;
subproject approval.&#13;
*  Use of Proven Technologies: The technology proposed for a project should have a track&#13;
record of demonstrated success in countries at a similar level of technological development&#13;
and infrastructure support, as in Sri Lanka.&#13;
*  Viability: Sponsors should possess a proven capability to develop, finance and operate the&#13;
infrastructure projects in countries at a similar level of development as Sri Lanka. To ensure&#13;
commitment, sponsors equity would need to represent at least 20 percent of the project cost&#13;
with the main project sponsors holding a minimum of 35 percent of the equity for at least 5&#13;
years after start up of commercial operations.&#13;
*  Limited Recourse Financing: Private investors and lenders should not require direct&#13;
sovereign guarantees. Lenders should rely on the security package (see Annex 2), future&#13;
cash flows from the project and the value of the assets for comfort. The debt financing must&#13;
include some portion of non-recourse commercial senior debt. PSIDC will not cover more&#13;
than 40 percent of the project's total costs.&#13;
*  Economic Rate of Return: The economic rate of return will exceed 12 percent and, where&#13;
applicable, the subprojects will form part of the least-cost development plan.&#13;
* Environment and Social Assessment Criteria: All projects will necessarily meet GOSL's&#13;
environmental and social assessment criteria as set out in the National Environmental Action&#13;
Plan as well as IDA's environmental and social assessment guidelines.&#13;
II.    Sub-Project Approval Procedures. The General Manager would prepare an appraisal report for&#13;
each subproject on the basis of a financial, technical and environmental assessments. The appraisal&#13;
report, along with a recommendation to make a loan would be forwarded by the Manager to the Board of&#13;
Directors, who would be responsible for sub-loan approvals. In order to ensure that the sub-projects meet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
the IDA's requirements regarding quality and viability, the appraisal report prepared by the General&#13;
Manager would be sent to IDA for concurrent review. Once the recommendation of a sub-loan is&#13;
accepted, the General Manager and staff, including consultants, would be responsible for loan&#13;
documentation and negotiation, as well as supervision and monitoring and fulfilling reporting and&#13;
auditing requirements. Sub-loan disbursements and collection would be initially handled by the&#13;
accounting specialist. Details of this procedure are set out in BOX I.&#13;
~~~~~ ~~~BoxlI&#13;
Sub-Loan Approval Process&#13;
Summar&#13;
* GOSL issues a Letter of Intent (LOI) to the selected Private Project Company.&#13;
*  The Private Project Company submits a Loan Application to PSIDC together with the Loan&#13;
Application Fee.&#13;
* The General Manager (GM), in collaboration with IDA, will carry out a prelim'inary assessment&#13;
based on the information received in order to ascertain the eligibility of the. subproject by the PSIDC.&#13;
* The GM will submit a recommendation to the Board of Directors to accept the loan applications and&#13;
for the authorization to commence negotiations.&#13;
*  If the Board of Directors clears the operation, the GM will issue a Preliminary Acceptance Letter&#13;
(PAL) to the Private Project Company including a draft-term sheet and sub-loan agreement.&#13;
*  The Private Project Company will convey their acceptance of the PAL and deposit the Sub-loan&#13;
Appraisal Fee&#13;
*  If the proposal was unsolicited, the Private Project Company will complete.the.project's Feasibility&#13;
Study in accordance with the LOI and the PAL.&#13;
*  The GM, supported by consultants, will participate in the negotiations of the Security Package (SP)&#13;
with the Private Project Company.&#13;
*  At the same time, preliminary negotiations of the Sub-loan Agreement witl take. place and be&#13;
evaluated by the GM, supported by consultants&#13;
*  Once the SP is initiated, the GM will undertake the subproject appraisal and prepare an Appraisal&#13;
Report including Due Diligence.&#13;
*  The GM will seek approval of the loan by the Board of Directors.&#13;
*  The GM will send the Appraisal Report, Draft Sub-loan Agreement and Engineering, Procurement&#13;
Construction (EPC) contract (if needed) to IDA for concurrent approval by the Board of Directors.&#13;
X  The GM will finalize negotiations of the Sub-loan Agreement with the Private Project Company.&#13;
*  The GM will sign the Sub-loan Agreement with the Private Project Company.&#13;

12.   In order to enable the PSIDC to prepare an appraisal report, the sponsors  (in the case of&#13;
unsolicited bids) would submit sufficient information for the General Manager to assess the sub-project.&#13;
This information would cover project design, engineering, cost estimates, implementation arrangements,&#13;
specifications of equipment and goods, a financing plan, prices, financial projections, proposed&#13;
arrangements for supply of essential commodities, services and sales of output, and proposed structure of&#13;
the Security Package (SP). The sponsors would also be required to submit an environment impact&#13;
assessment (EIA), including resettlement plans where applicable, in accordance with GOSL and IDA&#13;
guidelines. In the assessment of environmental impacts, due regard should be given to compliance with&#13;
prevailing occupational, safety and health standards. In its technical assessment the PSIDC would inter-&#13;
alia review:&#13;
(i)    site availability and its sustainability;&#13;
(ii)   availability of inputs;&#13;
(iii)   appropriateness of, and proven experience with technology offered;&#13;
(iv)   project design;&#13;
(v)    arrangements for detailed engineering;&#13;
(vi)   construction strategy;&#13;
(vii)  cost estimates;&#13;
(viii) procurement arrangements;&#13;
(ix)   arrangements for project operation and maintenance;&#13;
(x)    compliance with IDA's environmental guidelines and resettlement requirements.&#13;
13.    The PSIDC would also review: (i) adequacy of the financing package; (ii) financial viability of&#13;
the project under various scenarios; (iii) economic soundness including the calculation of the ERR; (iv)&#13;
adequacy and appropriateness of SP; and (iv) corporate structure of the sub-projects entity. In order to&#13;
ensure that the sub-projects meet the IDA's requirements regarding quality and viability, the appraisal&#13;
report prepared by the Company would be sent to IDA for concurrent review.&#13;
14.    For solicited bids, feasibility studies would most likely be prepared under the TA provided for&#13;
this purpose (see Annex 10). These studies would set out the technical criteria and undertake a selection&#13;
of these assessments in advance of detailed project preparation.&#13;
15.    Detailed methodology of the financial, technical, economic, and environmental (including&#13;
resettlement) parameters that cover loan documentation for the PSIDC will be set out in its operating&#13;
manuals. The operating manual will be prepared by the General Manager of the PSIDC and are a&#13;
condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit.&#13;
16.    Once the recommendation of a sub-loan is accepted, the General Manager and staff would be&#13;
responsible for loan documentation and negotiation, as well as supervision and monitoring and fulfilling&#13;
reporting and auditing requirements. Sub-loan disbursements and collection would be handled initially&#13;
by the accounting specialist.&#13;

The Security Package&#13;
The sub projects would be undertaken on a build-own-operate (BOO) or on a built-operate-transfer&#13;
(BOT) model and are to be financed on a limited recourse basis in order to promote private investment in&#13;
Sri Lanka. Under this arrangemenit, the investors (or their contractors) will assume full completion and&#13;
operational risks, but the lenders will look primarily to the expected cash flow of the sub projects for&#13;
security. The cash flow, in turn, is dependent upon the strength of the agreements comprising the Security&#13;
Package (SP). The parties of the Security Package are the following:&#13;
(i)    The Government&#13;
(ii)    The Investors (Project Co.)&#13;
(iii)   The Line Agency&#13;
(iv)   The Supply Company (fuel a Power Project, bulk water if a water project, etc)&#13;
(v)    The Operator&#13;
(vi)   The Lenders&#13;

SriLanka&#13;
GOSL's Sub-Project Pipeline&#13;
3.1        This annex provides an overview of some of the projects which have been identified by&#13;
GOSL as potential candidates for private sector investment. Three areas of infrastructure development-&#13;
-power, transport (toll roads and ports), and urban services (water supply, waste water and solid waste&#13;
management)-- were considered for potential private sector investment. This portfolio was produced by&#13;
SIDI and the respective line agencies and ministries, and none of the sub-projects have been appraised&#13;
by IDA in terms oJf economic or fiancial viabiliXy. Other infrastructure projects, such as those in&#13;
telecommunications and those involving cross-sector investments, although not delineated in the annex,&#13;
can also be considered as potential beneficiaries under the project.&#13;
3.2        Given the critical need for infrastructure development, but realizing the constraints&#13;
imposed by tariff policies, land acquisition problems, and the relatively new concept of private sector&#13;
investment in traditionally financed public infrastructure, the annex delineates GOSL's pipeline of&#13;
possible private sector led projects. These projects could act as the core private sector development&#13;
program and provide a catalyst to further private sector investments. The successful closure of any&#13;
private sector BOO/BOT project will necessarily enhance investor confidence and increase the chance&#13;
of successfully financing some of the longer-term projects&#13;

PRIVATE SECTOR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (PSIDP)&#13;
Organization. Financial Operations and Projections&#13;
1.    Introduction. The Private Sector Infrastructure Development Company, (PSIDC or the&#13;
Company) has been established as a public company with the specific objective of functioning as&#13;
the executing agency for the PSIDP. It will, on behalf of GOSL, make decisions on placement of&#13;
multi-lateral and bilateral credit resources as debt for eligible private sector infrastructure projects.&#13;
At present, the only lending instrument contemplated under the PSIDP is the provision of long&#13;
term subordinate debt, as a way to catalyze private investments in infrastructure and to mitigate&#13;
the constraints arising from lack of sufficient long term commercial credit and export credit cover&#13;
for Sri Lanka.  This would enable sound commercial projects to be financed, even in an&#13;
environment of high country risk, through long tern credit support under non - or limited -&#13;
recourse project financing mechanisms. PSIDP financing would increase the total amount of&#13;
financing available for projects in Sri Lanka by providing comfort to banks and commercial&#13;
institutions, which typically lack the appetite for lending and/or offer short tenors on loans, if&#13;
made. Sponsors draw comfort too, since the provision of subordinate debt, with longer grace&#13;
periods, increases the internal financial rates of return of economically sound, but commercially&#13;
risky projects and improves debt service cover ratios.  This annex describes the financial&#13;
organization and operation of the PSIDC in order to meet these objectives.&#13;
Design and Organization&#13;
2.    Desin. The basic rationale for the financial design of the project stems from the need to&#13;
make sound financing decisions in respect of sub-projects that apply for loans. Thus, it is&#13;
necessary that the institution charged with making these decisions, operate on commercial&#13;
principles and be perceived as fair and transparent. The organizational arrangements under the&#13;
PSIDP have evolved in line with these principles. The executing agency, the PSIDC will be&#13;
organized to make placement decisions in an autonomous and transparent manner, with adequate&#13;
information, and on the basis of sound evaluation criteria.&#13;
3.     Other Options for the Facilitv. The project preparation process extensively examined the&#13;
viability of placing the facility in an existing financial institution, but its sheer size and impact&#13;
were seen as potential problems. The size of the facility and average loan size envisaged would&#13;
have meant that the repository financial institution would violate single borrowing and capital&#13;
adequacy requirements.  In addition, the concept of having one of the two 'privatized'&#13;
development banks manage the debt facility was rejected due to potential conflict of interest&#13;
between acting as custodian of public funds and its own lending activities.&#13;
4.      Organizational Structure of the PSIDC   The PSIDC was incorporated as a public&#13;
company in August 1995. It will be the executing agency for the project. It will place IDA funds&#13;
received from GOSL as debt in viable infrastructure sub-projects. The PSIDC has the mandate to&#13;
identify, evaluate, approve and supervise suitable sub-projects under the Articles of Incorporation&#13;
of the Company. It has been incorporated with a nominal share capital of 2,000 Rupees divided&#13;
into 20 shares of 100 Rupees each, of which 14 are held by the Secretary of Finance and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

others by individual shareholders, all in trust, for the GOSL. Placement decisions will be vested in&#13;
the Board of Directors and will be taken in accordance with criteria agreed with IDA. Following&#13;
approval by the PSIDC, and subsequently by IDA, the PSIDC will enter into a sub-project loan&#13;
agreement with, and make funds available to the sub-borrower. Funds designated for use as long&#13;
term subordinated debt and their repayments will be maintained in an account at the Central Bank&#13;
of Sri Lanka (styled as the Fund A/c). This account will be independent from the PSIDC's&#13;
operating account (OP a/c) which would be established only for meeting its day to day operating&#13;
requirements.&#13;
5.      Operating Procedures   The PSIDC's operations would be directed by the General&#13;
Manager, with a small staff, which initially would include a financial analyst, an accountant and&#13;
an infrastructure project specialist. These professionals would be supported by short term&#13;
consultants, on retainer, to assist in legal, technical, financial and environmental aspects of sub-&#13;
project evaluation and financial risk assessment. The manager would be supported by a long term&#13;
resident advisor, who would help coordinate all activities and identify the need for short term&#13;
subject specialists. Loan disbursements and collections would be handled by accounting expertise&#13;
within PSIDC. Sub-project processing would be carried out by the PSIDC's General Manager&#13;
and his staff under the overall direction and control of the Board of Directors. The PSIDC would&#13;
approve sub-projects for financing only after ensuring that the proposals are consistent, both with&#13;
Sri Lanka's national priorities and with IDA's requirements on sub-sector policies. The sub-&#13;
projects would meet technical, economic, financial and environmental viability criteria and&#13;
national or IDA environmental standards (including criteria for involuntary resettlement, should it&#13;
arise) in case of IDA supported sub-projects. Ordinarily the question of a sub-project being&#13;
compatible with national planning priorities would be examined by the line ministries and SIDI,&#13;
before recommending it for financing. In fact the Letter of Intent (LOI) issued by the GOSL,&#13;
which forms the basis of the project financing, implies that the sub-project has met all national&#13;
criteria. IDA will be consulted on the adequacy of the sub-sectoral policy framework. It would be&#13;
incumbent on the PSIDC to conduct these adequacy and consistency tests while screening&#13;
potential private sector sub-projects.&#13;
Financial Structure and Operations&#13;
6.     The underlying principles for structuring the PSIDC have been evolved on the basis of&#13;
Bank experience with PSEDF in Pakistan, modified to suit the specific country situation in Sri Lanka.&#13;
The basic elements of the financial structure are; (a) the size and capital structure of the PSIDC, (b)&#13;
lending terms to sub-projects - maturities and pricing, (c) financial projections of loan placement,&#13;
servicing and repayment, (d) nature and extent of spread income and its deployment, (e) foreign&#13;
exchange implications, and (e) financial management, accounting, monitoring and oversight&#13;
arrangements. Each of these aspects is discussed in the following paragraphs.&#13;
7.      Size and Capital Structure  Appraisal of sub-project possibilities show that the near term&#13;
pipeline could consist of about $300 million investment in power generation, $ 300 million in&#13;
transport and ports and about $ 15 million in other sectors. The initial size of the fund, including&#13;
possible cofinancing, has been geared to partially finance this pipeline. The $70 million IDA funds&#13;
and $15 million KfW contribution would provide the initial corpus for PSIDC. Later, other&#13;
multilateral and bilateral sources of financing are anticipated. On the assumption that on average&#13;
about 30 percent of total project costs would be placed by PSIDC as subordinate debt, projects worth&#13;
nearly $250 million can be developed. Depending on the success of initial transactions, GOSL, IDA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-                                 Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
and the cofinanciers will review the future funding of the PSIDC. There will be substantial resources&#13;
generated by lending operations over time, due to the spread between borrowing and lending rates. It&#13;
is proposed to use these resources, which will accumulate in the Fund a/c, for financing new projects.&#13;
8.      Lending Terms The GOSL will pass through all credits from donors to the PSIDC on&#13;
terms similar to the original credit. Thus for PSIDC, IDA funds would carry an interest of 0.75&#13;
percent per annum and a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years. The PSIDC&#13;
will provide debt to sub-projects for maturities not exceeding a period of 22 years, including a&#13;
grace period of up to 8 years. Maturities and grace periods would be determined on a case-by-case&#13;
basis taking into account the nature of the sub-project. The maturity ceiling of 22 years has been&#13;
determined on the basis of prior experience in Pakistan and discussions with private sector players&#13;
and lenders. Considering the fact that maturities on commercial loans raised on project finance&#13;
basis would be 7-8 years, which with export credit cover, could possibly be stretched to 12 years,&#13;
the average maturity of the debt (both commercial and PSIDC) would be in the range of 15-17&#13;
years. This maturity profile then closely matches the concession periods of typical BOO/BOT&#13;
infrastructure projects, thereby rendering these projects financiable. Furthermore, interest during&#13;
construction of sub-projects would be capitalized and form part of the financing provided by&#13;
PSIDC to sub-project borrowers. In order to protect PSIDC's cash position during the start-up&#13;
period, there would be afive year moratorium on payment of interest by PSIDC to GOSL.&#13;
9.     Project funds are not earmarked for particular projects, thus allowing the PSIDC to&#13;
respond flexibly to market demands and to analyze each project on its own merits. A variable rate&#13;
option has been largely determined on the prevailing, albeit limited, market for foreign currency&#13;
loans in Sri Lanka, i.e. on the basis of IFC's proposed lending rate for an independent power&#13;
project in Sri Lanka -- for US dollar debt, a variable rate is envisaged at 6 month US$ LIBOR+250&#13;
basis points, for approximately 12 years. For pricing the debt under this project, a premium of 50&#13;
basis points has been added to reflect the longer maturities and the subordinate nature of the&#13;
lending. The variable rate basis has been tested in discussions with financial market players in Sri&#13;
Lanka and is appropriate to catalyze commercial sources of lending to participate in the sub-&#13;
projects.&#13;
10.    In view of the rigid end-use tariff structure in most sectors in Sri Lanka, infrastructure&#13;
project sponsors would have little or no flexibility to pass-through capital cost changes via the&#13;
pricing and tariff mechanism. Hence, it appears desirable to have a fixed rate interest option as&#13;
well for PSIDC debt. The fixed rate option would offer sub-project borrowers the choice of&#13;
pegging their interest rates to the prevailing rates for swaps between fixed and variable interest&#13;
rates or US$. A premium of 300 basis points would be charged as additional premium to reflect&#13;
the risk imposed due to country factors. Clearly, the interest basis risk would rest with the&#13;
borrower in the variable rate option. To summarize, the two options available to the sub-project&#13;
borrower are:&#13;
Variable interest rate based on 6 month US$ LIBOR, plus a premium of 3&#13;
percent (LIBOR+ 3 %).'&#13;
At present IFC is the market for long term US$ lending, as sole lender contemplating long term (10-12&#13;
year) loans for private sector sponsored infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka. Early IFC estimates of what&#13;
commercial lenders will expect for a variable rate on senior loans suggest a rate of 6 month US$ LIBOR +&#13;
250-275 basis points. Due to the subordinate nature of the loans under PSIDC and longer maturities being&#13;
&#13;

Financial Projections of loan placement, servicing and repayments.&#13;
11.    From  an accounting perspective, the PSIDC  will account for capital funds and&#13;
administrative funds separately. The Fund a/c would serve as the instrument of custody for donor&#13;
funds received from GOSL and their management. The Operating Account (OP a/c) of the&#13;
Company will deal with its administrative functions, such as receipts on account of fees etc.,&#13;
execution of technical assistance (TA) and routine management expenditure. The Fund a/c has&#13;
been placed in the Central Bank for reasons of transparency, as the Central Bank has no trustee or&#13;
oversight responsibilities.&#13;
12.    Funding and Execution of the Fund a/c. The account would be initially funded from&#13;
donor resources: IDA and KfW and possibly the ADB. The terms of the credits would be&#13;
determined between the respective donors and GOSL. PSIDC would be entitled to enjoy the same&#13;
maturity and interest rates for credits, as applicable to GOSL. The IDA portion of the funding&#13;
carries a service charge (interest rate) of 0.75 percent per annum and 40 year term (including a&#13;
grace period of 10 years). Funds placed in the Fund a/c would be placed in as debt in eligible&#13;
private sector companies for specific sub-projects. The initial corpus of available funds for&#13;
placement is anticipated to be US$84 million - $70 million from IDA and $ 14 million equivalent&#13;
from the KfW.&#13;
13.    Sub-loans made by the PSIDC would be repaid by borrowers in US dollars. The spread&#13;
resulting from interest rate differentials between those on PSIDC borrowings and on loans made&#13;
by the Company, as well as the capital accumulation resulting from different maturities on&#13;
borrowings and lending will be retained in the Fund a/c. These accumulated proceeds can serve as&#13;
funds for further placement in other projects. A specified portion of the spread income would be&#13;
deployed to defray operating expenses of the Company, once the TA funding is exhausted.&#13;
14.    Funding and Execulion cf the Operating a/c. The Operating account (OP a/c) would be&#13;
funded out of resources provided by GOSL, as share capital and transfers of TA grants, fees and&#13;
service charges and a pre-determined share of the interest spread income. The TA resources&#13;
would help the Company to meet most of its initial fixed costs and the costs of hiring professional&#13;
staff and consultants and for training and staff development. However, the TA would only be in&#13;
place for the first four years and the Company is expected to be self-sustaining thereafter. The&#13;
PSIDP envisages an initial TA of US$3.5 million for meeting the cost of setting up the Company,&#13;
management expenses, legal technical environmental and financial appraisal of projects,&#13;
negotiations of placement agreements etc. In addition, another TA component of US$3.5 million is&#13;
envisaged to fund feasibility studies, environmental assessments and other preparatory work&#13;
related to project promotion and development activities, including evaluation and negotiation&#13;
expertise as required by the line Ministries.&#13;
contemplated, an additional premium was placed on the LIBOR based loans to arrive at the 6 month US$&#13;
LIBOR + 300bp.&#13;

15.   The indicative expenditures on these items are detailed below. An initial expenditure of&#13;
US$ 300,000 is envisaged for setting up the office of the PSIDC. Recurrent management&#13;
expenses, such as the costs of hiring a resident technical/legal advisor for the PSIDC, local staff&#13;
salaries, short-term consultancy services for specific project evaluation work, transport, premises&#13;
and office expenses and training and staff development are expected to cost US$ 835,000 per&#13;
annum. The expenses for the first two years would be fully covered by the TA, but in the&#13;
following two years, only 70 percent of staff and personnel costs, office expenses and&#13;
contingencies would be met by the TA. The GOSL/PSIDC would meet the remaining 30 percent&#13;
of costs for these items. Against a total expenditure of US$ 941,000 on these items over the four&#13;
years that the TA is effective, IDA loan covers $800,000 and the GOSL/PSIDC share is $141,000.&#13;

*  Commitment fee @ of 0.75 percent of the committed funds.&#13;
*  Project monitoring fee @ of 0.25 percent of the yearly outstanding balance, subject to&#13;
a ceiling of US$50,000 per annum.&#13;
19.   Financial Projections: The financial projections for the PSIDC, covering a period of 15&#13;
years have been prepared on the basis of four indicative infrastructure projects for a total cost of&#13;
US$ 210 million. The subordinate debt financing for these projects has been assumed to be in the&#13;
30-40 percent range, amounting to US$84 million, or the initial size of the Fund. However, the&#13;
financial projections indicate only the subordinate debt portion to be met from IDA funding, which&#13;
is US$ 70 million.&#13;
20.    The key assumptions underlying the financial forecasts are:&#13;
(a)    Interest rates and maturities for donor loans are similar to IDA terms, i.e. 40 years,&#13;
including 10 years grace and a service fee of 0.75 percent per annum.&#13;
(b)    For sub-project financing, interest rates are based on six month US$ LIBOR+3&#13;
percent. Maturites for the indicative sub-loans vary from 15 to 20 years, with a&#13;
maximum grace period of eight years. Interest during the construction period of&#13;
the sub-project is capitalized and paid in four annual instalments, commencing in&#13;
the year following completion of construction.&#13;
(c)    Cash surplus with the PSIDC's Fund a/c  account resulting from the interest&#13;
spread is retained in the Fund a/c account of the Company.&#13;
(d)    PSIDC reinvests cash surplus at the end of each year and receives a return of 4.5&#13;
percent per annum.&#13;
(e)    The PSIDC has an assumed tax rate of 15 percent, which is in line with the&#13;
corporate tax rate offered under Sri Lankan law to companies that qualify for&#13;
Board of Investment (BOI) status. The PSIDC is expected to meet the criteria for&#13;
receiving BOI status.&#13;
(f)    Nominal share capital of the PSIDC (amounting to nearly Rupees 2,000) is not&#13;
included in the financial projections.&#13;
21.    Nature and Extent Qf spread income and its deplovment: Credits from IDA to GOSL carry a&#13;
service charge of 0.75 percent per annum and a term of 40 years with ten years grace. These terms&#13;
are passed on to the Company. However the PSIDC places debt at significantly higher rates, for&#13;
maturities varying between 15-22 years and a maximum grace period of 8 years. The differences&#13;
between the funding and placement terms of the PSIDC will result in cash surplus in the Fund a/c&#13;
over time. In addition to interest spread, the difference in the maturity and grace periods of loans&#13;
placed by the PSIDC and the credit from IDA to GOSL also leads to cash retention in the Fund&#13;
a/c. The principal repayments on the project loans placed by PSIDC commence from year 8&#13;
&#13;

onwards. Indicative financial projections show that, with an initial capitalization of US$70&#13;
million, accumulated interest spread reserves are US$ 12 million in year 6, increasing to US$40&#13;
million in the tenth year of operation.  It is envisaged that accumulated reserves would be&#13;
principally deployed for financing other new projects, with a small share being used to cover&#13;
operating expenses. Since the fund finances upto 40 percent of project costs, additional projects to&#13;
the tune of US$160 million can be financed by PSIDC by the tenth year of operation. The spread&#13;
deployment would thus enhance PSIDC's ability to leverage more private investment.&#13;
22.    Foreign Exchange Implications.  Foreign exchange risk implications arise from a) the&#13;
transactions occurring between the PSIDC and the sub-project borrower; b) the PSIDC and the&#13;
GOSL, with its obligations to IDA. In the placement transaction, between PSIDC and sub-project&#13;
borrower, loans from PSIDC (and debt service repayment) are denominated in US dollars, whereas&#13;
project revenues will most likely be in local currency. As in typical project finance transactions,&#13;
the sub-project borrower may be able to mitigate a part of the risk through currency depreciation&#13;
pass-throughs in the purchase agreements, or hedging and/or exchange rate insurance.&#13;
23.    There are exchange rate risk implications for IDA and PSIDC also.  Although the&#13;
placement and repayment currency for PSIDC are US dollars, as is its currency of repayment to&#13;
GOSL, the obligations of GOSL to IDA are denominated in SDRs and repaid in dollars by GOSL.&#13;
Risks arising from an adverse movement of the dollar against SDRs are normally borne by the&#13;
borrowing government.&#13;
24.    Financial management. accounting, monitoring and oversight arrangements: The PSIDC&#13;
would conduct its business in accordance with international standards and its accounts would be&#13;
audited by a firm acceptable to IDA. IDA oversight arrangements in respect of proposal evaluation,&#13;
project appraisal and lending decisions would apply to all sub-loans. IDA will ensure that the&#13;
projects qualifying for PSIDC loans satisfy Bank guidelines with respect to environment,&#13;
resettlement and procurement and meet the test of consistency with agreed sub-sector policies and&#13;
objectives.&#13;

ENVIRONlMENT AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT FRAMF,WORK&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
A. Purpose&#13;
1.    A list of sub-projects, outlined in the SAR, which is comprised of candidates for private sector&#13;
participation and potential borrowers from the proposed facility, is being prepared in close consultation&#13;
with the GOSL. The projects include power stations, port developments, toll roads and waste water&#13;
treatment plants. As no project is at an advanced enough state to require financing from the proposed&#13;
facility at present, a full environmental assessment (EA) for sub-projects is not possible at the outset. In&#13;
such circumstances, OD 4.01 (para. 9) required that arrangements be made whereby the project&#13;
implementing institutions undertake the functions of subproject screening, EA review and&#13;
implementation of mitigation and monitoring plans. This document describes the arrangements and&#13;
procedures proposed for the project. It is being submitted to the Board in lieu of a project EA and will be&#13;
the basis of the environmental aspects of appraisal. It is also being made available for public review in&#13;
appropriate locations in Sri Lanka and in the IDA's Public Information Center in accordance with BP&#13;
17.50 requirements for disclosure. Detailed EAs for individual sub-projects in Category A and other&#13;
appropriate analysis for those in category B will be carried out by the private sponsors and cleared by&#13;
IDA prior to any disbursements (on-lending) to the sub-projects.&#13;
B. GOSL Environmental Regulations &amp; Procedures&#13;
2.    In 1981 the GOSL passed the National Environmental Act (NEA) and in 1982, created the&#13;
Central Environmental Authority (CEA)-as a regulatory and enforcement agency. The CEA's statutory&#13;
and enforcement powers were strengthened significantly in 1988, by an amendment to the NEA. A&#13;
cabinet level ministry to handle the subject of environment was created in 1990, with the appointment of&#13;
a Minister of Environment to ensure that environmental issues would be given the required attention.&#13;
The GOSL also developed the Environmental Protection License (EPL) Scheme, with the CEA as the&#13;
enforcing agency, as a regulatory instrument to set industrial pollution standards and control their&#13;
discharges. The GOSL issued its National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in 1991, which was the&#13;
first of any Asian country. The NEAP identified the main environmental issues that need to be addressed&#13;
in Sri Lanka.&#13;
3.     Under provisions of Part IV C of the NEA No 47 of 1980 as stipulated in Gazette (Extra&#13;
Ordinary) No 772/22 dated June 24, 1993, the GOSL made Environmental Assessment (EA) a legal&#13;
requirement for a range of development projects. The list of projects requiring an EA are prescribed in&#13;
the above Gazette notification (Attachment 1). In addition, the Gazette notification includes a list of line&#13;
ministries and agencies that are designated as Project Approving Agencies (PAA). With the change of&#13;
government in August 1994 and the resulting reallocation of Ministries, a new list of PAAs were&#13;
specified--under subject area rather than with name of the Ministry as listed originally--in Gazette (Extra&#13;
Ordinary) No 859/14 dated February 13, 1995 (Attachment 2)&#13;
4.     According to GOSL procedure, any activity that falls within the domain of a prescribed project is&#13;
subject to an environmental impact assessment (EIA). The EIA approval/disapproval can be granted by&#13;
the PAA with jurisdiction over the project activity, only with concurrence of the CEA. However, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-69-                                   Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
project proponent is not permitted to perform the functions and duties of a PAA. Therefore, in the event&#13;
of a PAA becoming a project proponent, the CEA will designate an appropriate PAA. In instances where&#13;
the project would fall within the purview of more than one PAA, the CEA will determine an appropriate&#13;
PAA. Any functions of the PAA related to the approval of the project can be devolved to a Provincial&#13;
council only with written concurrence of the Minister in charge of the subject of Environment.&#13;
5.    The proponent of a prescribed project is required to submit preliminary information on the&#13;
project--by filling out a questionnaire--to the PAA, as early as possible in the project cycle. The PAA in&#13;
consultation with CEA is responsible for subjecting the preliminary information to environmental&#13;
scoping, in order to set the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the EIA. The TOR is prepared by a Technical&#13;
Committee (TC) comprising experts in the relevant field, appointed by the PAA. In developing the TOR,&#13;
the regulations provide for the PAA to consider the views of state agencies and the public.&#13;
6.    Upon submission of the EIA by the proponent, the PAA is required to determine whether issues&#13;
referred to in the TOR have been addressed and notify the proponent of any inadequacies within 14 days.&#13;
In the event any inadequacies are identified, the proponent is required to make necessary amendments&#13;
and resubmit the report. Once accepted, in addition to the EIA being forwarded to the CEA by the PAA,&#13;
notice is also placed in the government Gazette and in a national newspaper published daily in Sinhala,&#13;
Tamil and English languages inviting the public to make written comments, if any, to the PAA within 30&#13;
days. The notification would specify the times and places at which the EIA would be made available to&#13;
the public. As a minimum, the report would be available at the CEA, PAA and in a GOSL agency in the&#13;
locality of the proposed project. The environmental regulations have provisions for public hearings on&#13;
the project, although it is not mandatory. The PAA is required to forward all comments--either written&#13;
or raised during the public hearing--to the project proponent for review and response within 6 days of&#13;
completion of the public comment period. The proponent is required to respond to all such comments in&#13;
writing to the PAA.&#13;
7.    The TC appointed by the PAA would then evaluate the EIA and require the project proponent to&#13;
respond to any queries raised by the TC. The TC would also evaluate the adequacy of the proponent's&#13;
response to any comments raised during the public comment period. Upon completion of the evaluation&#13;
of the TC, the PAA, with the concurrence of the CEA, would grant approval for implementation of the&#13;
proposed project subject to specified conditions or refuse approval for implementation of the project,&#13;
with reasons for doing so. This notification must be made within 30 days of receipt of responses from&#13;
the proponent. The PAA is required to specify a period within which the approved project should be&#13;
completed. In the event the proponent is unable to complete the project during the specified period,&#13;
written permission for an extension has to be obtained from the PAA, 30 days prior to the expiration&#13;
date.&#13;
8.    The PAA is responsible for forwarding a report which contains a plan for monitoring the&#13;
implementation of the approved project, to the CEA, within 30 days from granting of approval. It is also&#13;
the responsibility of the PAA to publish in the government Gazette and in one national newspaper&#13;
published daily in Sinhala, Tamil and English languages, the granting of approval for the project.&#13;
9.    It is mandatory that the project proponent inform the PAA of any alterations to the project as&#13;
approved and/or the abandonment of the project. The PAA shall, where necessary , obtain fresh approval&#13;
in respect of any such alterations that are intended to be made to the approved project. The PAA, in&#13;
consultation with the CEA, would also determine the scope and format of the supplemental report&#13;
required to be submitted for such alterations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-70-                                    Annex 5&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
10.   In addition, the Coast Conservation Act (CCA) of 1981 also specifies an EIA procedure for&#13;
projects to be located in the coastal zone of the country. This preceded the CEA requirement, and has&#13;
been previously applied for a limited range of development projects--hotels, land reclamation and power&#13;
plant. This CCA defined procedure will continue to apply for projects proposed in the coastal zone.&#13;
11.    Adequacy of GOSL Environmental Clearance: The composite GOSL environmental clearance&#13;
process (EIA, EPL, CCA), in principal, is consistent with the Bank's environmental and public&#13;
disclosure requirements. The exception being the screening criteria adopted in the GOSL process, where&#13;
project thresholds are used to determine the type of clearance required and the content of public&#13;
consultation. Given the recent origin of the CEA regulated EA procedure, implementation experience is&#13;
yet evolving.  Thus reliance cannot be placed on it entirely.  In the initial years of project&#13;
implementation, IDA will review the sub-project EA reports for all A rated projects prior to approval.&#13;
IDA will at least initially also review the environmental analysis for Category B projects as well.&#13;
C. Justification for IDA Review of EA&#13;
12.    Due to the institutional situation in Sri Lanka and certain unique aspects of the project, the IDA&#13;
will rely on its full internal review of the sub-project EAs for A rated projects, to ensure that they are&#13;
consistent with OD 4.01. IDA will at least initially also review the environmental analysis for Category&#13;
B projects as well. GOSL EA regulations and procedures, as described above, meet generally accepted&#13;
standards, but their implementation has not evolved to the point where they can be relied upon to provide&#13;
adequate environmental safeguards for the sub-projects. Ordinarily this would be remedied by including&#13;
an institutional strengthening component in the project to improve implementation of GOSL EA&#13;
regulations or, if that were not possible, by developing environmental assessment and environmental&#13;
credit risk management capacity within the financial intermediary.  Institutional strengthening for&#13;
environmental management in Sri Lanka is being administered through several IDA supported projects&#13;
(SMI-IV. PFDP, CEIP and EAIP), in addition to USAID's NAREPP (see description of these initiatives&#13;
below.) This institutional strengthening work has fully engaged the absorptive capacity of Sri Lanka's&#13;
core environment agencies. Moreover, it is of necessity a medium- to long-term undertaking. It is&#13;
therefore unlikely that sufficient progress will be made to meet the EA needs of the earlier sub-projects&#13;
under PSIDP. However, strengthening PSIDC's environmental assessment capabilities would not in the&#13;
long run strengthen the environmental capabilities of GOSL, nor would it be appropriate, as PSIDC has&#13;
been devised as a transitional instrument, with a finite life. Thus, relying on IDA review of A rated sub-&#13;
projects will necessarily provide the best method of ensuring consistency with OD 4.01. IDA will at&#13;
least initially also review the environmental analysis for Category B projects for OD 4.01 consistency.&#13;
13.   The Bank-supported TA components in SMI-IV, PFDP and CEIP, USAID's NAREPP (all&#13;
currently under implementation) and the proposed Bank-supported EAIP (currently under preparation)&#13;
include the following extensive institutional strengthening measures: In addition to civil works for&#13;
industrial wastewater treatment and solid waste management and a Pollution Control Abatement Fund,&#13;
SMI-IV has financed preparation of a comprehensive Industrial Pollution Management Strategy,&#13;
including: i) a 5-year strategic plan; b) a laboratory accreditation scheme; c) laboratory equipment,&#13;
including provisioning for eventual certification of CEA's lab as a reference lab; and d) a private labs&#13;
window to promote accreditation of private labs. Implementation of these activities is proceeding under&#13;
PFDP and CEIP.&#13;
14.    USAID's NAREPP has supported a range of environmental policy development and institutional&#13;
strengthening activities, including: a) support for application of environmental economics to policy,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71-&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
planning and program analysis; b) assistance for updating and revision of the National Environmental&#13;
Action Plan (NEAP); c) analysis and improvement of management at the Ministry of Transport,&#13;
Environment and Women's Affairs (MTEWA) and the Central Environment Authority (CEA); d)&#13;
support for MTEWA's interagency coordination and development of environmental cells in key agencies&#13;
(Project Approving Agencies), including TA and training to improve conduct and oversight of EA by&#13;
CEA and the PAAs; and e) development of graduate environmental education programs in four leading&#13;
universities in Sri Lanka.&#13;
15.   EAIP proposes complementary support for core environment agencies at the national level. The&#13;
institutional component of NEAI will strengthen the national policy formulation role of MTEWA, the&#13;
policy implementation role of CEA, the environmental management capacity and the environmental&#13;
planning and assessment capabilities of selected PAAs. Proposed initiatives to strengthen CEA include&#13;
building a stable and competent environmental cadre through improvements in remuneration,&#13;
recruitment and training; prioritization of CEA's Corporate Plan; strengthening industrial licensing,&#13;
laboratory, monitoring and enforcement capabilities; and improving EA through coordination with&#13;
NAREPP's comprehensive EA training program and targeting selected PAAs for focused environmental&#13;
planning and EA capacity development.&#13;
D. Procedures for IDA EA and Sub-loan Approval&#13;
IDA EAA prova&#13;
16.   EAs of A rated sub-projects and initially B rated projects would be subject to IDA review and&#13;
approval, and because these sub-projects are not yet known, the environmental review and approval&#13;
process will take place during project implementation. To ensure consistency of sub-project EAs with&#13;
OD 4.01, an environmental consultant would be retained by PSIDC to assist and provide technical&#13;
guidance to the Private Project Companies (PPCs) during the loan application and approval process.&#13;
17.   There are two principal stages of EA preparation and environmental review that are integrated&#13;
into PSIDC's sub-project review and approval process. They are: i) review and agreement on the TORs&#13;
of the EA; and ii) review, comment and approval of the EA report. Review of TORs. The PSIDC will&#13;
make its environmental consultant available to the PAA to advise on the scoping and drafting of TORs.&#13;
The consultant have access to detailed information about the proposed sub-project activities and sites at&#13;
this stage. Review and approval of the EA report. The PPC will submit the EA report to the PSIDC and&#13;
PAA: i)first submission; ii) adequacy verification; iii) resubmission. PSIDC forwards the EA to IDA.&#13;
IDA's comments are forwarded by PSIDC to PAA and incorporated into EA requirements of PPC. PAA&#13;
conveys decision on EA. The package the GM sends to IDA for final approval should include the&#13;
internal appraisal report, PPC's feasibility study, the draft sub-loan agreement and security package and&#13;
the PAA approved EA.&#13;
The GOSL requirements for advertisement and public comment on sub-project EAs will meet the&#13;
requirements of BP 17.50 for local disclosure. The sub-project EAs will also be placed in IDA's Public&#13;
Information Center when formally received for IDA review.&#13;

ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK&#13;
Resettlement Aspects&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
I.    The PSIDP is expected to attract private sector investors in the development of infrastructure&#13;
and public utilities by providing long term subordinated debt facilities to prospective investors. The&#13;
project represents a departure from the traditional, public sector financing and operation of infrastructure&#13;
facilities, and would introduce the private sector into domains hitherto controlled entirely by&#13;
government. Hence, it will be necessary for the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) to develop&#13;
appropriate policies to safeguard public interest, particularly with regard to environmental and social&#13;
impacts of such private sector projects. The framework for the processing and implementation for&#13;
environmental assessment aspects of the project to address environmental concerns has been prepared&#13;
separately. This note outlines a strategy developed in consultation with the Ministry of Environment&#13;
(MOE), the Central Environmental Agency (CEA) and the Ministry of Land, Forestry and Natural&#13;
Resources (MOL), to deal with adverse social impacts of infrastructure projects that will be planned and&#13;
implemented by private sector sponsors under the PSIDP.&#13;
2.     The sub-projects likely to be financed under the PSIDP could involve expropriation of private&#13;
lands and other properties. In general, land requirements for individual sub-projects are likely to be small&#13;
and large scale resettlement is not envisaged. It is also anticipated that where only small blocks of non-&#13;
residential lands are needed (e.g. gas/oil powered thermal power stations, effluent treatment plants), the&#13;
project sponsor would make use of the normal land market mechanism and purchase lands directly from&#13;
the owners. However, for more land-intensive projects, such as highways and hydroelectric projects,&#13;
where the nature of the project limits flexibility with regard to location, it may not be possible to avoid&#13;
economically important lands (i.e. lands with productive potential and/or of residential value.) Road&#13;
projects, if passing through densely populated urban areas, could entail substantial resettlement. In such&#13;
cases it will be necessary for GOSL to acquire land under the country's land expropriation laws and to&#13;
make it available to the project sponsor. Irrespective of the mechanism employed for securing lands for&#13;
private sector projects, principles and policies under the PSIDP should seek to ensure that both GOSL&#13;
and World Bank guidelines are met.&#13;
3.    In World Bank assisted  projects, borrowers are expected to take all necessary measures to&#13;
mitigate adverse social and environmental impacts. The same principle would apply in the case of&#13;
borrowers under the PSIDP. In the conventional World Bank project the Government or a public sector&#13;
agency is the borrower/executing agency, whereas in the PSIDP, the borrowers are private sector parties.&#13;
The costs associated with resettlement measures would also be met by the private sector borrower and&#13;
would constitute a part of the project costs. The PSIDP would thus require general guidelines to be&#13;
followed in all projects involving resettlement, and specific resettlement plans will be required for each&#13;
sub-project, based on these guidelines. The plans and their implementation will be mandated in project&#13;
related agreements among the private sector borrowers, the on-lending agency (The Private Sector&#13;
Infrastructure Development Compnay or PSIDC) and the GOSL. This memorandum describes a set of&#13;
resettlement principles, objectives, policies and processing requirements, recommended to be adopted for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 11&#13;
all sub-projects under the PSIDP, which involve involuntary resettlement of project affected persons&#13;
(PAP).'&#13;
B.    The Legal Context&#13;
4.     The acquisition of private properties for public purposes in Sri Lanka is governed by (a) The&#13;
Land Acquisition Act (LAA - 1956), (b) State Land(Recovery of Possession) Act (1979) and (c) Urban&#13;
Development Projects (Special Provisions) Act (1980).  Other legislation related to land tenure and&#13;
agricultural lands, such as the Land Reform Law (1970), Agricultural Services Act (1979) and the Paddy&#13;
lands Act (1958), also have direct or indirect implications for involuntary resettlement. In addition, the&#13;
National Environmental Act of 1988, incorporates issues related to involuntary resettlement through its&#13;
broad-based definition of environment and covers impacts of a development intervention on population&#13;
living in the area, or at least, CEA has been interpreting so with considerable effectiveness.2 It is also of&#13;
major significance that in recent times, the CEA has refused to grant project approvals in cases, such as&#13;
.the Colombo Katunayake expressway and the Upper Kotmale Hydroelectric project on issues related to&#13;
inadequate mitigating measures for populatic.. displacement and resettlement.&#13;
5.     While these laws provide instruments for taking over private properties after paying a legally&#13;
determined compensation to owners. they do not set out any principles or standards to ensure that those&#13;
who lose such properties or who are displaced in the process are not subjected to social and economic&#13;
hardships. In general, the limitations of LAAs in the context of resettlement are well known.&#13;
Recognizing these limitations, GOSL in 1981, through the Ministry of Lands, issued a circular (dated&#13;
January 1, 1981) advising all ministries and government departments to limit acquisition to the bare&#13;
minimum and, where necessary, undertake relocation of people affected by acquisition of their lands and&#13;
houses. Although, this instruction does not have a mandatory status, agencies like RDA, UDA and CEB&#13;
had been undertaking limited relocation of project affected people (PAP). These efforts, however, have&#13;
remained ad hoc and appear to be inadequate in the absence of any detailed guidelines or regulatory&#13;
mechanism. The principles and mechanisms recommended in the following paragraphs, in the specific&#13;
context of the PSIDP, conform to accepted practice as enunciated by GOSL and the present legal&#13;
framework in Sri Lanka.&#13;
C.    General Principles&#13;
6.     All sub-projects that entail acquisition of land or other assets (legally owned or customarily&#13;
used) will be required to assess its impact on people living in the affected area. This impact assessment&#13;
will be carried out as an integral part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) under specific&#13;
Terms of Reference (TORs) issued by the CEA directly or through the Project Approval Agency (PAAs)&#13;
set-up by the CEA for a specific project, and would be subjected to the same processing requirements&#13;
and regulatory mechanisms as mandated for regular EIAs under the Environmental Act.&#13;
For the purposes of the PSIDP, project affected persons are defined as "all persons residing, cultivating or&#13;
carrying out economic activities within the areas acquired for the project, prior to a formally recognized cut off&#13;
date." Lack of legal titles to the land/property would not constitute a bar to being considered as a PAP.&#13;
2The new draft National Environmental Protection Act proposes to define environment as "the physical, social and&#13;
psychological factors of the surroundings of human beings, including the land, soil, water, atmosphere, climate,&#13;
sound, odors, tastes and the biological factors of animals and plants of every description." (Section 129, in the draft&#13;
act)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
7.     The responsibility for planning the resettlement program and its implementation would lie with&#13;
the sub-project borrowers, subject to the approval of the plans and implementation supervision by the&#13;
PAA/CEA (on behalf of GOSL) and PSIDC/IDA. The terms and conditions related to the&#13;
implementation of the resettlement component would be mandated both in the project agreement&#13;
between the Government and the sub-project borrower and the loan agreement to be executed between&#13;
the sub-project borrower and the PSIDC, in accordance with this policy. Therefore, in effect, the PSIDC&#13;
would have the full authority of the loan agreement for ensuring implementation of the approved&#13;
resettlement plan.&#13;
8.     Wherever a proposed sub-project offers flexibility in terms of location options, all efforts will be&#13;
made to locate such projects on unoccupied/unutilized government or private lands purchased directly&#13;
from the land owners. Compulsory acquisition of economically important lands will be resorted to only&#13;
for projects with limited locational options, such as roads or hydropower projects.&#13;
9.     Wherever possible the sub-project sponsor would use regular market mechanism to obtain the&#13;
required land. No resettlement plan would be necessary in such cases. However, if the land so&#13;
purchased involves displacement of people, other than the owners of the lands, e.g. encroachers, tenants&#13;
or lease-holders, it will be necessary for the sponsors to seek clearance from PAA/CEA and PSIDC/IDA&#13;
regarding the resettlement measures that may be necessary.&#13;
D.    Resettlement of ProJect Affected Peopl&#13;
(a)    Principles and Objectives:&#13;
10.    All sub-project resettlement programs will be guided by the following principles and objectives&#13;
and the PAA/CEA and the PSIDC would ensure that the resettlement plans prepared by the project&#13;
sponsor are in concurrence with these objectives and principles.&#13;
1. Involuntary displacement will be avoided or minimized wherever possible by exploring&#13;
alternative project designs and locations.&#13;
2. Project affected people will be compensated and resettled so as to improve their living standards&#13;
or at least to maintain their pre-project level living standards.&#13;
3. Land Acquisition and Resettlement will be planned and implemented in such a way as to cause&#13;
least possible amount of social, cultural and economic disruption&#13;
4. Project affected persons will be: (i) compensated for their losses at full replacement cost (either&#13;
in cash or in replacement house/land) prior to relocation, (ii) assisted in the transfer of residence and&#13;
during the transition period at the relocation site and, (iii) assisted in their efforts to improve their&#13;
living standards at the new location.&#13;
5. Special measures will be incorporated in the resettlement plan to protect socially and&#13;
economically vulnerable groups such as women headed families, children and aged people without&#13;
support structures and, people living in extreme poverty.&#13;
6. All persons cultivating or carrying out economic activities within the areas acquired for the&#13;
project, prior to a formally recognized cut off date, will be considered as a PAP and will be entitled&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-77-&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 11&#13;
to resettlement. Lack of legal titles to the land a person is cultivating or using for carrying our&#13;
economic activities will not act as a bar to resettlement entitlements.&#13;
7. The previous level of community services and resources will be maintained or improved after&#13;
resettlement.&#13;
8. A project affected person will not be dispossessed of his/her property nor displaced from his/her&#13;
place of residence or employment without payment of full compensation and/ or without making&#13;
arrangements for relocation and rehabilitation. The construction schedules at any given site would&#13;
be integrated with the land acquisition and resettlement time tables, to ensure that all land&#13;
acquisition activities are completed prior to the commencement of construction at that site.&#13;
9. The entire cost of resettlement program will be considered as an integral part of the project cost&#13;
and accordingly will be budgeted in annual and overall implementation plans of the project.&#13;
Resettlement costs will be annually adjusted for inflation and cost overruns, and increases in costs&#13;
would be the responsibility of the sponsor. Safeguards in this respect would be incorporated in the&#13;
loan agreement between the sponsor/borrowers and the PSIDC.&#13;
10. The resettlement programs will be planned with the consultation and agreement of the PAP and&#13;
their active participation would be encouraged in its implementation.&#13;
I1. There will be effective mechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during the&#13;
implementation of resettlement programs.&#13;
(b)    Entitlement Policy:&#13;
I1.   The entitlement policy aims to enable project affected people to replace the assets (land, house&#13;
and other means of livelihood) they have lost on account of the project, to recover and to improve upon&#13;
their pre project living standards within the shortest possible time. In general, a resettlement package&#13;
would consist of (a) provision for replacement assets or its cash equivalent, (b) cash grants to&#13;
compensate for the temporary disruption in life and economic activities and (c) provision for&#13;
replacement of community facilities and services at relocation areas.&#13;
12.   The entitlement policy described here is of a general nature. The resettlement entitlements&#13;
described below cover only broad categories and common situations. Sub-project resettlement&#13;
plans(RAP) will be required to translate these into project specific entitlement package according to the&#13;
nature of the sub-project resettlement issues. For the purpose of entitlements (total compensation and&#13;
resettlement package designed under the entitlement policy), the owner/occupier of the property under&#13;
acquisition and his/her immediate family (husband/wife, minor children and aged dependents without&#13;
independent means of livelihood) will be considered as a unit (affected family).&#13;
(i) Loss of agricultural land&#13;
13.    Land owning farmers: In general, farmers affected by the loss of land used for cultivation or&#13;
allied purposes will be provided with altemate farm land of equal or greater productivity at a location&#13;
acceptable to the affected person. Owner cultivators losing less than 25% of their holding will be given&#13;
either an equivalent area of land or cash compensation at replacement cost whichever is more practical.&#13;
Those losing more than 25% of their holding will be given an equivalent area of land (with the condition&#13;
that after the replacement, the total land holding would add up to an economically viable holding).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-78-                                  Annex 6&#13;
Page 5 of 11&#13;
Where the entire holding has been acquired or where the land remaining after acquisition has been&#13;
reduced to a non viable unit, area of replacement land will be subject to a economically viable&#13;
minimum, determined on the basis of the agro-climatic conditions prevailing in that area.3 Persons losing&#13;
75% or more of their holding or those who are left with a nonviable parcel of land after acquisition will&#13;
have the option of surrendering their entire land for acquisition.&#13;
14.    Landless farmers:  Landless persons affected by loss of land which they were cultivating&#13;
(registered as well as informal tenants) who are losing their cultivation rights on account of acquisition,&#13;
will be given an economically viable minimum parcel of land, which would be determined on the basis&#13;
of the agro-climatic conditions prevailing in that area.&#13;
(ii) Loss of Homestead Land&#13;
15.    Persons losing homestead land owned by them  will be entitled to an equivalent area of&#13;
replacement homestead land subjected to a minimum of 2 perches (50 sq. m) in urban areas and a&#13;
minimum of 40 perches in rural areas. Persons losing 75% or more of their homestead land will have the&#13;
option of surrendering their remaining land for acquisition. Persons losing less than 25% of their&#13;
homestead land may be given cash compensation at replacement cost or an equivalent area of land&#13;
whichever is more practical. Landless persons affected by loss of homestead which they occupied with or&#13;
without title will also be entitled to a homestead plot in accordance with these provisions.&#13;
(iii) Loss of Standing Crops, Trees etc.&#13;
16.    Standing crops, fruit trees and other commercially valuable trees that are standing on  the&#13;
acquired land on the date of dispossession will be compensated at full market prices.&#13;
(iv) Loss of Houses and Other Structures&#13;
17.    Persons who lose their houses and other structures will be given compensation reflecting the full&#13;
replacement cost of structure(s). The compensation may be in the form of a constructed house, cash or&#13;
part cash and part construction material.&#13;
18.    Tenants who lose their rented residential premises on account of acquisition of the property will&#13;
be provided with a cash grant equivalent to six months rent at current market rate in addition to the&#13;
statutory compensation the person may receive under the Land Acquisition Act.&#13;
19.    Persons whose residential premises are partly affected (such as the front portion of the house in a&#13;
road project) will have the option of (a) surrendering the entire structure and premises to the project&#13;
authority and receiving a similar replacement structure and a premise in the designated relocation area&#13;
(or its cash equivalent) or (b) cash compensation reflecting the full cost of damage and restructuring .&#13;
3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#13;
For example, one hectare irrigated land was the standard used for a economically viable family unit for&#13;
paddy cultivation in the Mahaveli Settlement Program. The size of the viable unit would vary according to the type&#13;
of land and the type of crop and, the standard viable unit need to be defined accordingly. However, it is important&#13;
to ensure that people are provided with a minimum viable unit of land sufficient to support a family.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

-79-                                  Annex 6&#13;
Page 6 of 11&#13;
(v) Loss of Business or Commercial Premises&#13;
20.    Persons whose commerciallbusiness premises are acquired for project purpose will be entitled to&#13;
receive an equivalent premise in a similar commercial locality or a cash compensation reflecting full&#13;
replacement cost of the premise without depreciation. In addition, they would be entitled to a cash grant&#13;
equivalent to six months net income from business to cover the cost of disruption to business.&#13;
21.    Persons whose commercial premises are partly affected will have the option of (i) surrendering&#13;
the entire structure in return for an equivalent premise in a similar commercial locality (or its cash&#13;
equivalent) or (ii) cash compensation reflecting the full cost of damage and restructuring.&#13;
22.   Persons who are losing their rented business premises will be entitled to (i) cash grant equivalent&#13;
to six months rent at current market rate and (ii) cash grant equivalent to six months net income from the&#13;
business to cover the cost of disruption to the business activity, in addition to the statutory compensation&#13;
the person may receive under the Land Acquisition Law.&#13;
(vi) Loss of Employment Opportunity&#13;
23.   Persons who are affected by loss of employment on account of acquisition and relocation will&#13;
preferably be re-employed in the reconstructed/relocated enterprise or in the project works, if feasible.&#13;
Alternatively, they would be given (i) a cash grant to cover loss of one year's wages, (ii) assistance under&#13;
the general poverty alleviation and employment creation programs of the provincial and/or national&#13;
government.&#13;
24.    Where the project is likely to cause unemployment on a wider scale, such as in the case of&#13;
acquisition of fishing grounds for harbor development or as in the case of submergence of large areas of&#13;
tea plantations, special rehabilitation plans for full re-employment will be planned and implemented as a&#13;
part of the resettlement program.&#13;
(vii) Other Resettlement Entitlements&#13;
25.    All persons who are forced to relocate will be entitled to (i) a standard relocation grant to cover&#13;
the cost of transportation of household effects to the relocation site and (ii) a resettlement transition&#13;
allowance of a reasonable amount to cover the period during which the PAP are unable to continue&#13;
normal economic activities.&#13;
26.   Where community infrastructure such as schools, water supply, power supply, roads, sewerage&#13;
systems and places of worship are affected, these will be replaced by the project at no cost to the affected&#13;
people. Similarly relocation sites developed under the resettlement program will be provided with all&#13;
basic amenities and services at no capital cost to the relocated community.&#13;
E.    Institutional Arrangements&#13;
27.    Resettlement Plan Approvals: The EIA process mandated under the NEA will be used as the&#13;
primary mechanism to ensure proper investigation of resettlement implications and preparation of the&#13;
detailed sub-project resettlement plans (RAP). Under the NEA, all projects prescribed under the Gazette&#13;
Notification No 722/22 (dated June 24, 1993) are legally required to carry out an EIA. In order to ensure&#13;
that resettlement impacts are adequately investigated during EIA, a TOR specifically dealing with the&#13;
resettlement component will be issued along with the TOR for EIA by the designated Project Approving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-80-                                     Annex 6&#13;
Page 7 of 11&#13;
Authority (PAA) to the sub-project sponsor. The TOR for the EIA would be prepared in consultation&#13;
with the PSIDC. The main sequential steps involved in the resettlement plan approval process are&#13;
indicated below:&#13;
1. Private Project Company (sub-project sponsor) furnishes a preliminary information report on&#13;
land acquisition and resettlement associated with the proposed sub-project to PSIDC and the&#13;
designated PAA at the earliest possible stage. The preliminary report would contain basic&#13;
information on the proposed location of the project, the total area of land required and the type of&#13;
land, current land use and possible impacts of land use change and, the proposed strategy for&#13;
procurement of land (direct purchase, negotiated settlement or compulsory acquisition).&#13;
2. PAA in consultation with PSIDC carries out the scoping session based on the preliminary report&#13;
and determines whether a full assessment of the resettlement component is required. Accordingly,&#13;
PAA issues the TOR to the sub-project sponsor for resettlement assessment and preparation of the&#13;
detailed resettlement plan. This will be done normally as a part of the EIA process and, in case the&#13;
proposed project does not require an EIA, as an independent process.&#13;
3. Sub-project sponsor undertakes the assessment and resettlement planning and submits the report&#13;
(RAP) to PSIDC and the PAA. PAA verifies the adequacy of the RAP, in light of policies, principles&#13;
and procedures set out in this document, and, if found adequate, presents the RAP for public review.&#13;
Simultaneously, PSIDC submits a copy of RAP for IDA's review and approval.&#13;
4. PAA asks the sub-project sponsor to incorporate comments from public and IDA into RAP and,&#13;
if found adequate, conveys its decision on RAP to sub-project sponsor.&#13;
5. PSIDC forwards the approved RAP along with other project related documents to GOSL and&#13;
IDA with recommendation for approval.&#13;
6. After obtaining concurrence of GOSL and IDA, PSIDC executes the loan agreement which&#13;
would also contain terms and conditions related to implementation of resettlement component.&#13;
28.    The smooth and efficient operation of this approval process  will depend on resettlement&#13;
expertise available with PAA and on the content of the TOR. It will be necessary for the PAA to include&#13;
experienced resettlement specialists in its Technical Sub Committee and to prepare precise and&#13;
comprehensive TOR that clearly specify what the PSIDC resettlement policy requirements are, what the&#13;
scope and coverage of the impact assessment should be and, what the resettlement plan should contain.&#13;
PSIDC would be willing to fund consultants for this purpose out of technical assistance available with&#13;
it.,&#13;
29.    Resettlement Implementation: Although the primary responsibility for implementation of the&#13;
approved resettlement plan rests with the sub-project sponsor (sub-project sponsor), the oversight&#13;
responsibility shall vest with the CEA. The PSIDC shall also carry out regular supervision as required&#13;
by IDA, to ensure that all Bank related guidelines and agreements are satisfied. The precise nature of this&#13;
responsibility will depend on the manner in which the land required for the project is made available and&#13;
4&#13;
Under the NEA, approval by PAA is subject to CEA concurrence. This will apply to resettlement plans as&#13;
well.&#13;
5There is a concurrent initiative under the World Bank's EAI project to strengthen the institutional capacity of CEA&#13;
to deal with complex environmental and resettlement issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-81-                                      Annex 6&#13;
Page 8 of 11&#13;
the terms of the agreement between sub-project sponsor and the counterpart government line agency&#13;
(such as RDA for toll road projects, CEB for power projects and so on) on whose behalf land will be&#13;
acquired by MOL . There are three possible scenarios:&#13;
(i)   The sub-project sponsor purchases the required land from willing sellers with clear ownership&#13;
titles. As this is a regular market transaction, sub-project sponsor is not required to carry out&#13;
any resettlement unless the land so purchased has encumbrances such as squatter settlements&#13;
or tenants. If the land has encumbrances sub-project sponsor will seek guidance of PPA/CEA&#13;
with regard to resettlement requirements. If PAA decides resettlement is required, sub-project&#13;
sponsor will carry out planning and implementation of resettlement, under the oversight of&#13;
CEA/PAA and the PSIDC.&#13;
(ii)  The counterpart line agency, under a formal agreement with sub-project sponsor, arranges to&#13;
acquire the land under LAA and to transfer it free of all encumbrances to sub-project sponsor.&#13;
In this case, the resettlement would need to be carried out before the transfer is made and&#13;
therefore, resettlement implementation responsibility will rest with the respective line agency.&#13;
The cost of resettlement would also be borne by the line agency (It would still be part of the&#13;
total cost of the project, but could be funded by the sub-project sponsor as reimbursement to&#13;
the line agency or could form the government equity in the project). The sub-project sponsor&#13;
would also need to reach an understanding with the line agency on how resettlement planning&#13;
will be coordinated during the EIA.&#13;
(iii) The counterpart line agency, under a formal agreement with sub-project sponsor, arranges to&#13;
acquire land under LAA and to transfer it with all encumbrances to sub-project sponsor. This&#13;
arrangement is presently resorted to in projects planned and implemented by the UJrban&#13;
Development Authority in Sri Lanka. In such cases, the responsibility for planning and&#13;
implementation of resettlement will rest with the sub-project sponsor under the oversight of the&#13;
CEA/PAA and PSIDC, and the agreement between the Government and the sub-project&#13;
sponsor will clearly define the division of responsibilites.&#13;
30.    It would be possible for the sub-project sponsor to entrust resettlement implementation to an&#13;
external agency (a government or non-government agency) specifically contracted for the purpose.&#13;
Additionally, in cases (ii) and (iii) above, it is possible for the sub-project sponsor and the counterpart&#13;
line agency to enter into an agreement on sharing of the resettlement implementation responsibilities&#13;
between them.&#13;
F.     Peoples Participation&#13;
31.    The sub-project sponsors would be required to investigate the nature and extent of land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement related issues, with the participation of the people in the project area and&#13;
their representatives. A broad acceptance of the proposed resettlement measures, relocation areas and&#13;
replacement lands by project affected people will be a necessary condition for the approval of the RAP&#13;
by PPA/CEA and PSIDC.&#13;
32.    The detailed RAP document, prepared with such participation and containing full details of, sub-&#13;
project impact, resettlement and entitlement policy, eligibility criteria, method of determination of loss&#13;
and compensation, complaint and grievance procedures, etc., will be made available to the public&#13;
including PAP during the EIA evaluation process. If necessary, sub-project sponsor would also make a&#13;
summary of these details available to project affected people in the form of booklets. PAPs can formally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

33.    Every affected family will be given an identity cum entitlement card at the earliest possible date&#13;
after the approval of the project. All disputes relating to eligibility or entitlement will be resolved within&#13;
three months after the issue of the identity cum entitlement card in camps held for that purpose in the&#13;
affected areas.&#13;
34.    During the implementation phase(or earlier if possible), the sub-project sponsor or their&#13;
designated agencies will promote formation of appropriate social organizations to facilitate participation&#13;
of affected people in the resettlement implementation. The concept of Community Development&#13;
Councils(CDC) successfully tried out in the Million Houses Program may be provide a model for such&#13;
social organizations.&#13;
G.    Resolving Grievances&#13;
35.    The LAA provides for the establishment of a "Review Board" to hear grievances related to&#13;
determination and level of statutory compensation. The common initial complaints about eligibility to&#13;
resettlement entitlement, quantum of compensation and other entitlements are expected to be resolved&#13;
during the camps specially held at the early phase of resettlement program (see under Peoples&#13;
Participation). Formation of Community Development Council and frequent interaction between the&#13;
CDCs and the implementing agencies would provide a regular forum for resolving normal grievances.&#13;
Legal remedies would be available to PAPs under the existing legal framework. Furthermore, a project&#13;
specific forum may be set-up to provide speedy remedies to PAPs to ensure that deviations from the&#13;
approved resettlement plan are adequately addressed.&#13;
H.    Resettlement Monitoring&#13;
36.    Monitoring of resettlement implementation will be carried out by the sub-project sponsor as an&#13;
integral part of the resettlement implementation plan and will cover both pre-relocation and post-&#13;
relocation activities. It will assess achievements against key implementation targets and the general&#13;
objectives and, accordingly make corrections in the implementation program where necessary. Six&#13;
monthly monitoring reports will be submitted to PSIDC and, if required under the approval conditions, to&#13;
PAA and CEA. In addition, PAA and/or CEA shall carry out implementation assessments on their own to&#13;
verify whether the resettlement plan is being implemented as it was approved. The PSIDC, may at its&#13;
own initiative, appoint special consultants to carry out monitoring and review of RAP implementation.&#13;
37.    For resettlement programs involving more than 100 families, independent monitoring and&#13;
evaluation(M&amp;E) will be instituted by PAA/CEA in consultation with PSIDC and the sub-project&#13;
sponsor. The primary objective of the M&amp;E is to assess the social and economic impact of the&#13;
displacement and resettlement, both during the course of implementation as well as after its completion.&#13;
A set of base line indicators(both objective as well as subjective) reflecting the social and economic&#13;
conditions of the affected communities will be established during the planning stage. The status of the&#13;
resettled families will be evaluated against these indicators during the first and third year after relocation.&#13;
The evaluation report will be submitted to sub-project sponsor, PSIDC and IDA. The cost of M&amp;E will&#13;
be part of the resettlement cost and an integral part of the sub-project cost estimates.&#13;

Corporate Resettlement Advisor - Terms of Reference&#13;
The Corporate Resettlement Advisor (CRA) would assist PSIDC to ensure that sub-loans&#13;
approved for IDA funding conform to the agreed guidelines on Resettlement Aspects under the&#13;
Environment and Social Assessment Framework (ESAF) for PSIDP. The CRA would report to the&#13;
General Manager, PSIDC and would be responsible for providing the following services:&#13;
a) Screen initial proposals received from Private Project Companies (PPCs) to ascertain the&#13;
nature and extent of land acquisition and resettlement implications, if any. Furthermore, the CRA will&#13;
review any prior assessments included in the preliminary proposals.&#13;
b) Assist PPCs in formulating terms of reference for Land Acquisition Assessment (LAA) and&#13;
facilitate its conduct. This assessment will indicate the nature and extent of R&amp;R impacts, possible&#13;
mitigation measures and the need or otherwise of preparing a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
c) Based on a review of the LAA and other R&amp;R issues, the CRA will brief the PSIDC Board on&#13;
the feasibility of accomplishing satisfactory R&amp;R arrangements in the project. This will be an interim&#13;
judgement, basically to rule out projects which present unsurmountable R&amp;R problems.&#13;
d) If the PSIDC indicates a willingness to pursue the project, the CRA will then facilitate the&#13;
preparation of the RAP in accordance with the ESAF. Facilitation would include preparation of TORs,&#13;
identification of consultants and provision of clarifications on agreed guidelines.&#13;
e) The CRA will review the RAP against the ESAF and submit an assessment to the PSIDC&#13;
Board on its conformity with the guidelines (including IDA guidelines, OD 4.3) and the feasibility of its&#13;
implementation.&#13;
f) The CRA will also assist PSIDC in ensuring that responses to the calrifications sought by other&#13;
approving agencies of GOSL and by IDA are provided.&#13;
g) If the project is cleared by GOSL and approved by PSIDC and IDA, the CRAs role will&#13;
involve overseeing satisfactory implementation of the RAP.&#13;
h) The CRA will also be responsible for general R&amp;R advice and services to PSIDC,&#13;
participating PPCs and local environmental consultants, including:&#13;
i) training of PSIDC and PPC staff in oversight of R&amp;R;&#13;
ii) supervision and training of local consultants;&#13;
iii) monitoring and supervision of RAP implementation, if necessary facilitating&#13;
external, independent reviews.&#13;

Terms of Reference for the General Manager&#13;
I.     Background and Objectives&#13;
1.         Given the high budget deficit, GOSL is constrained in its capacity to meet the increasing&#13;
demand for infrastructure services. GOSL's strategy to meet this growing demand focuses on expanding&#13;
the role of the private sector through BOO and BOT schemes and subcontracting. Private sector&#13;
participation, in an appropriate regulatory environment, especially where competition is feasible, is an&#13;
effective means to improve efficiency in the sector. However, international and especially domestic&#13;
long-term financing for large scale, privately sponsored projects continues to be a constraining factor.&#13;
With the view to facilitating the mobilization of long-term funds --both domestic and international-- and&#13;
capitalizing on private sector technical expertise, GOSL has endorsed public-private sector partnerships&#13;
for infrastructure development. The Secretariat for Infrastructure Development and Investment (SIDI)&#13;
was established, in part with USAID funds, to facilitate implementation of this policy. Furthermore, the&#13;
GOSL has recently established the Private Sector Infrastructure Development Company (PSIDC) to&#13;
provide long-term financing to private sector projects.&#13;
2.         The Company would be managed by a General Manager (GM) and he/she would have a small&#13;
staff of professionals responsible for managing the consultancy resources required for the preparation of&#13;
loan documentation, supervision and monitoring of sub projects. The GM would be established and&#13;
supported by IDA for a period of approximately four years, after which time it is expected to be self-&#13;
supporting.  Preparation of request for proposals including pre-feasibility studies, environmental&#13;
assessment, solicitation of private sponsors and structuring of the security arrangements and negotiations&#13;
will be undertaken by SIDI and the appropriate Line Agency, supported by consultants in line with GOSL&#13;
requirements. Appraisal and negotiation of the security package of the sub projects would commence once&#13;
sponsors are selected. During this process, the GM will report to the Board of Directors, which will ensure&#13;
transparency and inter-agency coordination. Consultants would also assist the GM in the preparation and&#13;
negotiation of loan documentation with the selected sponsors. Disbursements and loan administration&#13;
would be handled by PSIDC staff. The sub projects to be financed by the PS]DC would be required to&#13;
meet agreed technical, financial, economic, and environmental criteria.&#13;
3.         The PSIDC will cover 40 percent of the total cost of a private sector sub-project. The funds&#13;
will be lent to borrowers in US dollars or equivalent SL Rupees at variable (LIBOR + 3%) or fixed rates.&#13;
Fixed rates will be based on the term of the loan and the market swap rate plus 3%. Repayment will be over&#13;
a period of up to 22 years, including a maximum 8 year grace period.&#13;
4.         The Company Manager will be responsible for the day to day administration of the Company&#13;
and will represent GOSL in the sub loan negotiations. The Company Manager will be responsible to the&#13;
Board of Directors. The Manager will be supported by a resident advisor and short term consultants as&#13;
required (see Annex9); both financed by the TA component of the IDA Credit.&#13;
II.        SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
5.         The GM will be appointed by the GOSL in consultation with the IDA and will have the&#13;
following responsibilities:&#13;

Terms of Reference&#13;
Consultancy Services for the Preparation of Loan&#13;
Documentation. Negotiations and Monitoring of Sub-Projects&#13;
1.          The Terms of Reference set out the technical assistance provisions to the Private Sector&#13;
Infrastructure Development Project which is designed to help implement a strategy to encourage private&#13;
sector investments in infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka. The project included the creation of a Private&#13;
Sector Infrastructure Development Company (PSIDC or Company) which will provide long term debt for&#13;
infrastructure projects. The Consultant shall assist the Company in the preparation of loan documentation,&#13;
and the approval, supervision and monitoring of sub-projects in the private sector. The Consultant will be&#13;
staffed with qualified and experienced personnel specializing in finance, international banking, engineering,&#13;
legal matters, contract management and environmental assessment pertaining to the infrastructure sector.&#13;
especially in the power, transport and water supply sub-sectors.&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
2.          GOSL's strategy to meet the economy's growing demand for high quality infrastructure&#13;
services focuses on expanding the role of the private sector in provision of new infrastructure services&#13;
through BOO and BOT schemes. Given the high budget deficit, GOSL is constrained in its capacity to&#13;
meet the increasing demand for infrastructure services. Domestic market financing, mechanisms for&#13;
long-term private investment and foreign investment in large infrastructure project has been limited. With&#13;
the view to mobilize private resources--both domestic and international --and tap the technical   and&#13;
managerial expertise of the private sector in project design, finance, implementation and operation, GOSL&#13;
recently decided to promote public-private sector partnerships for infrastructure development through both&#13;
BOO (Build, Operate and Own), and BOT (Build, Operate and Transfer). The secretariat for Infrastructure&#13;
Development and Investment (SIDI) was established, in part with USAID funds, to facilitate&#13;
implementation of this policy.&#13;
3.          The Company to be established under proposed project would be managed by General&#13;
Manager with a small staff of professionals. They would be able to access consultancy resources required&#13;
for the preparation of loan documentation, supervision and monitoring of sub-projects. General Manger and&#13;
his staff would be supported by IDA for a period of about four years, after which the company would&#13;
become self supported. Preparation of request for proposals including pre-feasibility studies, environmental&#13;
assessment, solicitation of private sponsors and structuring of the security arrangements and negotiations is&#13;
being undertaken by various government agencies and departments.&#13;
4.          The General Manager also has access to funds for the preparation of feasibility studies for&#13;
select infrastructure projects. These funds will be used in association with line ministries as preparation for&#13;
solicited bids for BOT/BOO type proposals. Funds will be used for high priority projects and those that&#13;
have a comparative advantage in terms of attracting private sector investment.&#13;
5. Appraisal and negotiation of the Security package of the sub projects would commence once sponsors&#13;
are selected. During this process the General Manager will report to the Board of Directors, which will&#13;
ensure transparency and inter-agency coordination. Consultants would also assist the Company in the&#13;
preparation and negotiation of loan documentation with the selected sponsors. Disbursements and loan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

administration would be handled by PSIDC staff. The sub projects to be financed by the PSIDC would be&#13;
required to satisfy agreed technical, financial, economic and environmental criteria.&#13;
6.          The PSIDC will cover up to 40% of the total cost of a private sector sub-project. the&#13;
subordinated debt financing would be available to borrowers in US dollars or equivalent Sri Lankan Rupees&#13;
at either a variable interest rate of LIBOR + 3% or a fixed rate based on the term of the loan and the market&#13;
swap rate plus 3%. Repayment will be over a period of up to 22 years, including up to 8 years of grace.&#13;
B. Organization&#13;
7.          The Consultant shall provide necessary technical assistance to the PSIDC in sub-project&#13;
evaluation, including loan appraisal, negotiation of sub-loan agreement, implementation, supervision during&#13;
the construction period and monitoring.  The scope for these activities includes the total project&#13;
responsibilities for the PSIDC and coordination with the GOSL representatives which are involved in the&#13;
project definition, review and evaluation process. The Consultant is expected to provide one resident&#13;
advisor for the initial period covering the preparation of loan documentation, approval of loan, negotiations,&#13;
and implementation of the first sub-project.&#13;
8.         It is expected that the Consultant will work closely with the General Manager. Throughout&#13;
the assignment, the Consultant would report to the Task Manager of the Private Sector Infrastructure&#13;
Development Project in the World Bank.&#13;
C. Scope of Work&#13;
1.  Assistance to the PSIDC  on Preparation  of Loan Documentation and  Supervision of&#13;
Implementation&#13;
9.          During implementation of the private sector BOO/BOT initiative by the GOSL several sub-&#13;
projects are expected to be financed by the PSIDC Company. The specialized nature of the review&#13;
requirements covering a wide range of expertise (i.e., economics, finance, engineering, environmental,&#13;
legal, etc.) will exceed the skills and the mix of the staff of the PSIDC involved in the sub-project process.&#13;
Accordingly, the consultant shall provide short-term consultants to the work with the staff of the Company&#13;
to review and appraise the financial, banking, environmental, technical and managerial viability of sub&#13;
projects as required by the GOSL. The complexity and uniqueness of each sub-project will dictate the&#13;
general level of effort for short-term consultants.&#13;
10.         The functions within the scope of responsibility of the Consultant for preparation of loan&#13;
documentation, supervision and operations and environmental monitoring of sub-projects will include, but&#13;
not be limited to:&#13;
*  Analysis and evaluation of the sub-projects' financial and technical viability including costing&#13;
of equipment, insurance and proposed debt/equity funding sources; the sub-projects&#13;
marketability to international and local private and government financing agencies. The&#13;
analyses shall include confirmation of the sponsors and the proposed builders and operators&#13;
credit worthiness and management history/capability and the adequacy of the sub-projects'&#13;
insurance plans.&#13;
*  A review of procurement proposals to ensure that they are in compliance with requirements&#13;
of GOSL, IDA and other possible co-financiers.&#13;

Corporate Unit is expected to use short-term personnel to meet objectives. The Consultant shall undertake&#13;
all reasonable efforts to expeditiously provide or recruit candidates for each need. These candidates shall be&#13;
thoroughly screened for suitability (i.e. qualification, experience, ability, aptitude, etc.) prior to submission&#13;
for approval.&#13;
ll. Annual Work Plans&#13;
12.        The Consultant shall submit a time-phased life-of-project work plan with detailed and specific&#13;
plans for the long-term resident advisor within sixty days of contract award. The work plan will be subject&#13;

Technical Assistance&#13;
Supporting PSIDC &amp;Line Agencies in Sub-Project Preparation&#13;
The Private Sector Infrastructure Development Company (PSIDC) will have access to TA funds (US$&#13;
3.5 million) to support project preparation of individual sub-projects that have been identified by the line&#13;
agencies as suitable for private sector investment. This TA will be used in cooperation with the line&#13;
agencies to further develop existing pre-feasibility studies, undertake new studies and/or assist in sub&#13;
project preparation, evaluation and negotiation. The objective of the studies will be to provide complete&#13;
documentation to facilitate the solicitation of high caliber BOT/BOO bids for infrastructure projects.&#13;
Although these funds will be available to all sectors, they could prove most valuable in the sectors where&#13;
project preparation work is least advanced. It is envisaged that the TA funds will be utilized in support&#13;
of project preparation over a period of 4-5.&#13;
Due to the diversity of the sectors and sub-projects which may utilize the TA, it is impossible at this time&#13;
to delineate specific TORs for consultants to be funded. However, the following outline is indicative of&#13;
the type of activities that could be funded under the TA in the case of a feasibility study for the power&#13;
sector:&#13;
Technical:&#13;
I.     Collection of relevant data: the consultants shall review all relevant data available from existing&#13;
studies, reports and at site concerning the present situation of electric power supply and general&#13;
demand on future growth, particularly in regard to the following:&#13;
I.    Power consumption in the area by quality and type, the power demand, rate of growth both in&#13;
past and estimated future, typical daily load patterns with seasonal variations;&#13;
1ll.    Gross domestic product, resources and nature of consumption&#13;
IV.    System characteristics, such as frequency, voltage, power factor, load factor, diversity factor,&#13;

conditions of operations of the existing power stations in view of their interconnection with the&#13;
new unit;&#13;
XII.   Capacity of Plant: the consultants should determine the capacity and the numbers of plants most&#13;
suitable to the requirements and shall also indicate future provisions which should be kept. All&#13;
feasibility alternatives should be studied to arrive at a least cost solution in the long as well as the&#13;
short run&#13;
Xil.  Design of the Station: The consultant shall work out the basic lay out and design for the power&#13;
station and its principal components taking into consideration the following: i) site conditions;&#13;
ii) type of fuel available; iii) design and construction standard applicable; iv) environmental&#13;
pollution, site flooding, etc. v) requirements for training and manpower; vi)    preparation of&#13;
bid documents for the complete supply of power plant and its associated ancillary equipment and&#13;
electrical apparatus to facilitate tendering and evaluation.&#13;
Economic/Financial&#13;
Estimated Capital Cost: the consultants will determine the estimated capital cost of the project&#13;
both the foreign in US$ and local currency portions showing a break-down of all major&#13;
components. The cash flow requirements during the construction period should also be&#13;
determined;&#13;
I.    Working Capital: the consultants should determine required cash flow at start up of the plant and&#13;
at the end of the I st, 2nd, 3rd years to cover supplies, fuels, other consumable materials,&#13;
construction equipment, mobilization and demobilization cost and misc.;&#13;
Ill.    Annual Costs: the consultants should work out an estimate of the annual costs of proposed&#13;
project in respect to the following: i) number and cost of personnel; ii) quantity and cost of fuel;&#13;
iii) cost of maintenance and spares; iv) cost of depreciation and interest charges; v) taxes,&#13;
insurance and duties.&#13;
IV.    Estimated Annual Revenues: the consultants will work out the estimated total annual income&#13;
expected from the sale of output of the proposed plant. The income for all the years during the&#13;
economic life starting from the date of commission of the plant, based on present and future&#13;
power selling rates.&#13;
V.    Financial and Economic Feasibility: based on the findings above, the consultants will determine:&#13;
I) capacity; ii) dynamic cost of power generation per kWh; iii) the internal rate of return; iv)&#13;
present value of the investments; v) cash flow generated by the new project - financial&#13;
projections showing profits and loss; vi) analysis of financial statements showing that revenues&#13;
earned shall provide adequate return in investment and cover all estimated debt service and&#13;
operating and maintenance costs.&#13;
VI.    National Economic Benefits: the consultants will also determine-nine the list of benefits which&#13;
will accrue to the national economy owing to additional of the proposed plant.&#13;

Private Sector Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
B. Supervision Strategy&#13;
1.     Under PSIDP infrastructure subprojects from a variety of sub-sectors will seek financing in the form&#13;
of long-term subordinated loans. Due to the variety of sub-sectors potentially involved and the fact that&#13;
PSIDC will enter into long-term loan agreements for highly complex infrastructure projects, IDA estimates&#13;
that this project will require a significant amount of supervision. It is envisaged that about 20 staff weeks&#13;
annually will be required to adequately supervise the project at its different stages. Although the resources&#13;
necessary for the supervisory work delineated below will come largely from IDA, there exists the possibility&#13;
for joint supervision missions with existing or future cofinanciers of the project. The three primary stages of&#13;
the project, for. purposes of supervisory work, include the following: i) Institutional Arrangements; ii)&#13;
Development Impact; and iii) Subproject Review. It should be noted that, where relevant, IDA will make use&#13;
of the Project Implementation and Development Impact Indicators outlined in Annex 12 in carrying out the&#13;
supervision strategy outlined below.&#13;
Institutional Supervision&#13;
2.     Semi-Annua: The risks and potential bottlenecks for the project will vary over time, and as a result&#13;
so will the level and composition of supervisory work. During the first stage of the project--during which&#13;
operating manuals for PSIDC are written, staff is hired and formnal reporting and accounting procedures are&#13;
established--IDA supervision will concentrate primarily on institutional arrangements, ensuring that the&#13;
proper operating framework and environment is set to facilitate a subproject lending program.&#13;
3.     Mid-tern:      Once the operating framework and environment is established to the satisfaction of&#13;
IDA, supervision will focus on the effectiveness of PSIDC in meeting the needs of the market and to ensure&#13;
design actually functions in practice as envisaged. At the mid-term review, IDA will undertake supervisory&#13;
work to review the lending terms and financial products offered by PSIDC to determine whether they are&#13;
adequately addressing the private sector sponsors' needs/requirernents.&#13;
Development Impact Supervision&#13;
4.     Annual.        One potential risk with involving the private sector in the provision of infrastructure&#13;
is that the benefits of any IDA/GOSL funds used in financing these subprojects may not be passed along to&#13;
the end-user. A further risk to the project is that PSIDC, as the project implementing agency, will not be&#13;
complemented by the necessary GOSL sub-sector policies to encourage economically sound private sector&#13;
investment. PSIDC may be working in an incomplete policy environment. Therefore, the supervision of&#13;
the evolution of the policy environment will address the development impact of the project with respect to&#13;
the above risks. On an annual basis, IDA will review the progress on the various sub-sector policy&#13;
frameworks to ascertain: i) that concerns over end-user benefits, in terms of infrastructure coverage, access,&#13;
adequacy and reliability of supply and the prices paid, are adequately addressed; and ii) that new policies in&#13;
each sub-sector, formulated to increase efficiency in provision of infrastructure services and enhance private&#13;
sector participation, are sufficient.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 11- B&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
Subproject Review and Supervision&#13;
5.     Project Determined:1   This supervision component will essentially review the implementation of&#13;
specific subprojects financed by PSIDC under a two stage process. The first stage will largely focus on the&#13;
subprojects and PSIDC's review of the loan applications and subproject appraisals. This review will include&#13;
an examination of the subprojects in terms of environment, resettlement, procurement, economic viability,&#13;
consistency with IDA's sub-sector strategy, etc. The specific schedule and intensity of supervision for this&#13;
stage cannot be spec:fied with certainty at this point, since it will be largely dependent upon the number of&#13;
loan applications received by PSIDC and the number of subproject appraisals conducted. PSIDC will be&#13;
required to hire technical advisors for careful monitoring during the implementation of the subprojects. The&#13;
reports prepared by the advisors will be submitted to IDA for review. The second stage of supervision will&#13;
be the semi-annual supervisory mission which will focus largely on the subprojects in PSIDC's loan&#13;
portfoliolt will include a review of the timeliness and quality of subproject implementation, compliance with&#13;
standards specified for construction, procurement, environment and resettlement, and operations and&#13;
maintenance. The subproject supervision will also assess the economic impact of the subprojects, the extent&#13;
to which they might contribute to the formulation of more efficient sectoral policies, and the technical and&#13;
financial perfornance of the subprojects.  As the loan portfolio grows over time and due to the complex&#13;
nature of private sector infrastructure projects financed on a project-finance basis, it is envisaged that this&#13;
element of the supervision strategy will require the most resources.&#13;
Mid-term Review&#13;
6.     In addition to the supervision strategy outlined above, IDA will undertake a mid-term review of the&#13;
PSIDP in December 1998. It is envisaged that this review will take place approximately two years after loan&#13;
effectiveness and will be used as an opportunity to review the project in the context of subprojects financed&#13;
to date, the investment climate in the country in terms of the relevance of such a project financing facility&#13;
and products being offered, GOSL policies in the sub-sectors and their linkage to the project, and&#13;
institutional changes in PSIDC to better meet the project's objectives, etc.   This review will be quite&#13;
extensive and require input from private sector speciaiists, project finance specialists, institutional specialists,&#13;
etc.&#13;
The sub-sector component of the project involves third party participation by private sector sponsors and commercial lenders&#13;
outside the control of IDA and the GOSL.. Unlike traditional public sector projects when IDA and the GOSL agree on a time&#13;
bound supervision plan, the lack of third party input at this stage of the project precludes such detail .&#13;

NOTES for the Project Implementation and Development Impact Indicators&#13;
For PSIDP, indicators were selected which lie closest to the project's objectives and the&#13;
underlying measures that the project is supporting. Four categories of indicators were chosen for&#13;
PSIDP: input, process, output and impact. The choice of this framework for defining indictors is&#13;
based to a large extent on the recent work entitled " Project Performance and Development Impact&#13;
Indictors for Projects in Private Sector Development: First Editions Note, Private Sector&#13;
Development Department, October 1995".&#13;
The input indicators show what resources the project Will provide in order to achieve&#13;
specific outputs. The process indicators relate to different stages of project implementation and are&#13;
used to monitor progress towards specific project targets. The output indicators measures number&#13;
and magnitude of each subproject. For PSIDP, four or five transactions would be considered an&#13;
excellent record. In PSD projects, it appears that outputs indicators are the most important and are&#13;
linked to the direct project objectives and are used, on completion of the project, to evaluate&#13;
whether the objectives have been met. These indictors are often linked to the number of&#13;
transactions. Transactions also need to be linked to quality, and not only to quantity. The&#13;
screening process for subprojects has been carefully set up in the project design to assure that the&#13;
transactions that will result should be of the highest quality. Finally, the impact indicators are&#13;
meant to capture long-term development impact of the project and will be used for evaluation after&#13;
sometime has elapsed following project completion.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Private
            Sector Infrastructure Development Project is to develop a
            modern and efficient infrastructure system in Sri Lanka by
            promoting significant private sector participation. More
            detailed objectives of the project are to: 1) establish a
            government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) facility for the placement of
            long-term debt that will work in tandem with private sources
            of capital to facilitate potential private sector
            investment; 2) encourage significant participation of the
            private sector in the investment, implementation, operation
            and maintenance of new infrastructure facilities; and 3)
            strengthen GOSL's ability to attract, negotiate and
            close private sector sponsored infrastructured projects by
            increasing capabilities to evaluate and negotiate projects
            with private sponsors. The project will support the
            following components: 1) establishment of a long-term debt
            facility; and 2) associated technical assistance including
            technical assistance to support the Private Sector
            Infrastructure Development Company as well as the line ministries.
