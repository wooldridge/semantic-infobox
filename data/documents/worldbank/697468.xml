CHILE&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
SECONDARY EDUCATION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Recent Economic Trends and Future Prospects&#13;
1.1   Background. Chile's first democratic government, headed by President Aylwin, ended&#13;
its term on March 11, 1994. A second democratic government, under President Frei, was&#13;
inaugurated immediately thereafter. During 1989-94, Chile achieved an impressive economic&#13;
record: GDP averaged 7.1 percent annual growth; inflation declined to an annual rate of 8.9&#13;
percent; and unemployment remains at a low 6.5 percent. The balance of payments continued to&#13;
register surplus due to inflow of long-term capital and direct foreign investment. As a&#13;
consequence, the Central Bank accumulated ample reserves (the equivalent of almost ten months&#13;
of imports by the end of 1994), which has led to repeated nominal appreciations of the peso.&#13;
1.2   Employment. Uninterrupted economic growth has increased the overall level of&#13;
employment, especially in the non-tradable sectors (construction, commerce, personal services,&#13;
transport, communication, and financial services). The economy now operates at close to full&#13;
employment. Although the unemployment rate has risen from 5.3 percent in 1989 to 6.5 percent&#13;
in 1994, it is expected to fall due to continued economic growth of around 6.8 percent until the&#13;
end of the decade. The general increase in employment also contributed to an increase in the&#13;
employment of women. The participation rate of women in the labor force increased from 31&#13;
percent in 1990 to 33.5 percent in 1993. Higher employment has exacerbated the shortage of&#13;
skilled labor, especially in the construction and manufacturing sectors. Real wages increased on&#13;
average by 4.4 percent over the 1990-94 period.&#13;
1.3   Role of the Private Sector. The government has strongly supported the establishment of&#13;
a dynamic private sector. The vast majority of Chilean firms are small (employing from 10 to&#13;
49 workers), yet accounted for less than 20 percent of total sales in 1992 and had a stagnant&#13;
growth rate. Growth is strongest among large firms (employing more than 50 workers), which&#13;
showed an annual average growth rate of nearly 10 percent. Chile's exports increased from 26&#13;
percent of GDP in 1985 to 30 percent in 1992, yet small firms continue to produce a small share&#13;
of exports, which are mainly produced by large firms.&#13;
1.4   Medium-Term Outlook. The Chilean authorities estimate that in 1995, economic&#13;
growth will be around 6 percent. Inflation is expected to fall from 8.9 to 8 percent. Projections&#13;
envisage that the economy can grow annually at an average of 6.8 percent over the next ten&#13;
years, driven mainly by strong export growth of almost 10 percent per year. The external&#13;
balance will continue to improve as copper prices should remain high, along with a rapid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
increase in non-traditional exports. The current account deficit (0.9 percent of GDP in 1994),&#13;
should remain modest. Foreign reserves will continue to increase as capital inflows are expected&#13;
to remain strong. The fiscal situation is expected to continue to be sound, although social&#13;
expenditure and infrastructure investments will continue to increase.&#13;
1.5   The above scenario, or even one calling for a slightly higher growth, will require&#13;
increases in the productivity and efficiency of the economy, especially when considering the&#13;
challenge presented by an appreciating peso. This growth scenario will entail some fundamental&#13;
improvements in the stock of human capital and flexibility of the labor market, increased&#13;
absorption of new technology, and a surge in exports. Clearly a number of exogenous factors,&#13;
such as the price of copper and other international commodities, global interest rates and growth,&#13;
and regional trade prospects, will shape the frontier which Chile will be pursuing. However,&#13;
endogenous factors of paramount importance, such as increasing the efficiency and enhancing the&#13;
quality of education while improving educational equity and strengthening sectoral management,&#13;
will be critical in determining whether the medium-term growth outlook will become a reality.&#13;
B. Social Sectors&#13;
1.6   Chile's social development over the past three decades has been impressive. While&#13;
Chile's GNP per capita of US$3,073 in 1993 places it among the lower end of the scale for&#13;
middle-income countries, its social indicators closely resemble those observed in developed&#13;
countries. Chile's average life expectancy at birth of 72 years (1992) is well above the Latin&#13;
American average of 67.5 years; infant mortality rate is relatively low (17 per 1,000); the&#13;
prevalence of moderate and severe malnutrition (measured by weight-for-age) among children&#13;
under six years of age is less than 1 percent (1988), similar to that of developed countries.&#13;
There is universal access to eight grades of basic education. The average level of educational&#13;
attainment among the population 15 years of age or older in 1982 was about 6.5 years, reaching&#13;
10 years for the youngsters under 15 years old, and 12 years for household heads in the fifth&#13;
quintile of income. The overall adult literacy rate of nearly 94 percent gives Chile the second&#13;
lowest illiteracy rate in Latin America (next to Uruguay). Income distribution improved over the&#13;
1990-92 period as the gap between the richest 20 percent and the poorest 20 percent became&#13;
slightly narrower (Annex A, Table A-1). According to the National Socioeconomic Survey&#13;
(CASEN), the number of people living in poverty dropped by more than 800,000 during the&#13;
1990-93 period. CASEN estimates that the total number of poor Chileans now stands at&#13;
approximately 4.3 million, 33 percent of the total population, down from 45 percent in the late&#13;
1980s.&#13;
1.7   Social Expenditure. Social expenditure in education, health, housing, social security,&#13;
and other related sectors accounted for about 56 percent of total government expenditure (2.5&#13;
percent higher than in 1989) and ranked as a first priority in government expenditures during the&#13;
1990-1993 Aylwin Administration (Annex A, Table A-2). Social expenditure increased from&#13;
13.9 percent in 1985 to 15.3 percent of GDP in 1993, while maintaining fiscal balance (Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A, Table A-3). The increase was financed entirely by a tax reform carried out in 1990.&#13;
Expenditures for education, which accounted for about 20 percent of social expenditure and 3&#13;
percent of GDP, increased by 33 percent in real terms during this period. This was attributed&#13;
mainly to the effects of the: (i) increases in subsidies to schools (Annex A, Table A-4);&#13;
(ii) increases in teachers' salaries due to the enactment of the Teachers Statute Law (1991); and&#13;
(iii) Bank-financed Primary Education Quality Improvement Project (MECE, Loan 3410-CH) .&#13;
Table A-5 in Annex A shows development indicators for Chile in several sectors.&#13;
2. EDUCATION SECTOR: DESCREPIION AND ISSUES&#13;
A. Overview&#13;
2.1   Education Structure. The Chilean education system begins with preschool for children&#13;
under six years old. Preschool education is a noncompulsory service offered by an array of&#13;
public and private institutions to promote children's social, psychomotor, and emotional&#13;
development. Primary (or basic) education consists of an eight-year compulsory cycle for&#13;
children 6 to 13 years old. Secondary education is provided to students 14 to 17 years old who&#13;
have completed primary education. The structure of secondary education involves a four-year&#13;
cycle that is divided into two tracks: (a) a scientific-humanistic (S-H) curriculum that prepares&#13;
students for further studies through tertiary education; and (b) a technical-vocational (T-VOC)&#13;
curriculum to prepare students for work immediately after graduation. The first two grades of&#13;
secondary education (9 and 10) are known as the first cycle, and the last two grades (11 and 12)&#13;
are known as the second cycle. Secondary graduates who decide to continue their studies can&#13;
opt for the Centers for Technical Training which offer short-term, non-academic training&#13;
courses, or for tertiary education consisting of the universities or the professional institutes.&#13;
Special or differentiated education is provided to children 6 to 14 years old with learning&#13;
disabilities. Adult education programs are directed at individuals 16 years and older who want&#13;
to learn to read and write or who need to complete primnary or secondary education.&#13;
2.2   Non-Formal Vocational Training. Alongside the formal technical-vocational training&#13;
provided by the T-VOC secondary schools, Chile has a parallel, independent, non-formal system&#13;
that embraces several programs for job-seekers and individuals already in the labor force. This&#13;
non-formal system is supervised by the National Training and Employment Service (Servicio&#13;
Nacional de Capacitaci6n y Empleo, SENCE). SENCE is governed by representatives of labor&#13;
unions, employers' associations, and the Government, and is financed by levies on enterprise&#13;
payrolls'. Currently, there are more than 1,700 authorized providers of training services&#13;
(which include universities, professional institutes, and training centers, among others) which&#13;
SENCE uses to provide training to adults and youth from about 7,700 small, medium, and large&#13;
1/    Equivalent to 1 percent of the worker's payroll or three minimum wages (whichever&#13;
is smaller).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
companies. In 1992, the SENCE program trained over 261,000 workers, representing about 7.4&#13;
percent of the total formal labor force. The principal areas of training were: administration,&#13;
manufacturing, information technology, and commercial services.&#13;
2.3   Organization. The basic functions of the educational sector were reorganized following&#13;
the enactment of Law 18,956 on March 8, 1990. In accordance with this Law, the Ministry of&#13;
Education (MINEDUC) is responsible for policy-setting, core curriculum definition, supervision,&#13;
evaluation, resource targeting, and financial monitoring through its central, 13 regional&#13;
(SEREMIS), and 40 provincial departmental (DEPROV) offices, in a manner that is largely&#13;
independent of the municipalities. Municipalities are in charge of the daily operation of the&#13;
public schools, including: hiring and firing of teachers; paying personnel salaries under the&#13;
framework established by the Teacher Statute Law, and maintaining and improving school&#13;
infrastructure. Educational services are provided by municipalities and private proprietors, with&#13;
MINEDUC monitoring the quality of the services delivered. There are 334 municipalities which&#13;
provide educational services through about 280 Education Departments (DEM) and nearly 90&#13;
Corporations (Corporaciones), which are non-profit, publicly subsidized autonomous entities&#13;
presided over by the mayor of the respective municipality, and comprising important employer&#13;
associations. The organization charts of MINEDUC, SEREMIS, and DEPROVs appear in Annex&#13;
B, Chart B-1, while that of the municipalities appears in Annex B, Chart B-2.&#13;
2.4   Approximately 143,000 teachers in about 15,700 schools (61 percent municipal, 28&#13;
percent private-subsidized, 10 percent private paid, and 1 percent Corporations) provide&#13;
preschool, primary, secondary, and special education to the country's estimated 3 million&#13;
students (Annex C, Tables C-1, C-2, and C-3). In addition, the tertiary education system enrolls&#13;
over 285,000 students in universities, 43,000 students in the professional institutes, and nearly&#13;
74,000 in the Centers for Technical Training. Of the total pre-university enrollment, 8.5 percent&#13;
were registered in preschool, 68.7 percent in primary, 21.7 percent in secondary (13 percent in&#13;
the S-H track and 8.7 percent in the T-VOC track), and 1. 1 percent in special education. The&#13;
Metropolitan Region (RM) of Santiago comprises nearly 40 percent of total enrollment; the&#13;
regions of Valparaiso (V), Concepci6n (VIII), and Puerto Montt (X) comprise another 29.5&#13;
percent of the student population, with the remaining 30.7 percent scattered throughout the other&#13;
nine regions. From 1981 to 1993, total enrollment grew annually by only 0.4 percent, from&#13;
2.84 million to 3 million. This limited expansion was caused by a decrease of 3.4 percent in&#13;
primary education enrollment, even though there was an increase in the preschool, secondary,&#13;
and special education enrollments. The main reasons for the decrease in primary education&#13;
enrollment was a decline in the birthrate from 1.9 percent in 1970 to 1.7 percent in 1987, and a&#13;
reduction in primary education repetition rates among first graders (from 15.5 percent in 1982 to&#13;
9 percent in 1989).&#13;
2.5   Primary Education Quality Improvement Project (MECE). In spite of the&#13;
administrative educational reform undertaken by the Chilean authorities during the past decade,&#13;
and by the achievements in solving the traditional problems of literacy and access to primary&#13;
education, Chile's basic education system, especially municipal and government-subsidized&#13;
private schools, has faced issues of internal inefficiency, low quality, inequity, and weak&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
managementz'. The Government which was elected in 1990 launched a US$243 million&#13;
educational project (MECE), partially financed by the Bank (Loan 3410-CH of US$170 million),&#13;
to address the above-mentioned issues in basic and preschool education.&#13;
B. Basic Statistics in Secondary Education&#13;
2.6   Curriculum. The Constitutional Organic Law of Education 18,962, of March 10, 1990&#13;
(Ley Organica Constitucional de Ensenianza - LOCE), assigns MINEDUC the responsibility of&#13;
setting the secondary education core curriculum (for both the S-H and T-VOC tracks), and&#13;
empowers secondary schools with the task of defining the complementary curriculum and&#13;
establishing the school study plan and syllabi. During the 1990-93 period, only a few private-&#13;
paid secondary schools, mostly located in high-income urban areas, were able to implement the&#13;
recommendations of the LOCE. Most secondary schools in Chile do not have the technical&#13;
skills and instruments required to implement the recommendations of the LOCE. The few&#13;
school-study plans and syllabi that have been implemented have been characterized by:&#13;
(i) increases in the weekly study load; (ii) incorporation of new course materials; and&#13;
(iii) differentiated plans in the first (grades 9 and 10) and second (grades 11 and 12) cycles of&#13;
secondary school.&#13;
2.7   The secondary school year comprises 38 weeks of classes, equivalent to 1,221 hours of&#13;
45 minutes instruction in the first cycle and 1,332 hours in the second cycle. The teacher's&#13;
weekly hours of work may not exceed 44 chronological hours for the same employer. These are&#13;
distributed in 33 hours of classroom work per week and 11 hours for planning, preparation of&#13;
projects and tests, and other non-teaching, school-related activities. Each secondary school is&#13;
entitled to set its own schedule. In general, classes in secondary schools are held during the&#13;
morning for the second cycle, and in the afternoon for the first cycle.&#13;
2.8   The four-year, subject-based curriculum for the S-H track is highly fragmented and&#13;
includes 16 subjects (Spanish, Math, Chilean History and Geography, Universal History and&#13;
Geography, Philosophy, Civics, Economics, Foreign Language, Biology, Physics, Chemistry,&#13;
Artistic Education, Sports, Religion, and two electives). The curricula for the four-year T-VOC&#13;
secondary schools, which is also subject-based, consists of three highly fragmented areas of&#13;
study: (i) basic courses including Spanish, Math, Chilean History and Geography;&#13;
(ii) professional courses containing subjects related to potential jobs in the commercial, technical,&#13;
2/    This administrative reform consisted of: (a) transferring the preschool, primary, and&#13;
secondary schools to the country's 334 municipalities; (b) transferring a portion of&#13;
the vocational secondary schools to the Corporations created by associations of&#13;
employers; and (c) encouraging through a subsidy payment per student (subvenci6n)&#13;
private individuals and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to create tuition-&#13;
free schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
industrial, agricultural and maritime subsectors of the economy; and (iii) complementary courses&#13;
oriented toward the preservation of the environment, self-improvement, and the appreciation of&#13;
the arts and sports.&#13;
2.9   Enrollment. Total secondary education enrollment in 1993 amounted to nearly 653,000&#13;
students, of which 60 percent were registered in the S-H track and 40 percent in the T-VOC&#13;
track. About 51.2 percent of the total enrollment attended municipal secondary schools, 38.8&#13;
percent government-subsidized private schools (7.8 percent in schools administered by the&#13;
Corporations), and 10 percent attended private-paid schools. Nearly 40 percent of the&#13;
enrollment was concentrated in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago, another 30 percent in the&#13;
Regions of Valparaiso (V), Bio Bio (VIII), and Los Lagos (X), while the remaining nine regions&#13;
of the country absorbed 30 percent of total enrollment. Secondary education in Chile is mainly&#13;
an urban phenomenon, since almost 98 percent of total enrollment is concentrated in areas with&#13;
2,500 inhabitants or more. The regions with the highest concentration of rural secondary&#13;
enrollment are: Los Lagos (X), Maule (VII), and Aisen (XI) (Annex C, Table C-4). Females&#13;
represent over 51 percent of the total enrollment.&#13;
2.10 The gross enrollment rate of the 14-17 age cohort has steadily increased in the past two&#13;
decades, from 50 percent in 1970 to over 76 percent in 1992, at an annual rate of 1.9 percent&#13;
(Annex C, Table C-5). This enrollment rate is one of the highest in Latin America (Annex C,&#13;
Table C-6), and compares to countries with which it competes in world markets, such as Korea,&#13;
Hong Kong, and Singapore. Yet, it still lags behind the main OECD countries (Annex C, Table&#13;
C-7). During the last decade, enrollments in the S-H track decreased 0.4 percent, whereas&#13;
enrollments in the T-VOC track increased by 62 percent. Enrollment trends also show changes&#13;
by type of provider: between 1990 and 1993, enrollments in secondary municipal, private-&#13;
subsidized, and Corporation schools decreased by 8.8, 13.9, and 9.3 percent respectively, while&#13;
in the private-paid secondary schools it increased by 5.6 percent.&#13;
2.11  Within the T-VOC track, students are enrolled in one of five areas (among which are&#13;
more than 30 specializations): 41.8 percent in the commercial sector; 35 percent in the industrial&#13;
sector; 16.7 percent in the technical sector; 4.8 percent in the agricultural sector; and 1.7&#13;
percent in the maritime sector. Within the five T-VOC areas mentioned above, women's&#13;
enrollment tends towards the commercial and technical specializations.&#13;
2.12  Teachers and Supervisors. From the 50,000 total secondary education teachers,&#13;
approximately 88 percent are assigned to in-classroom teaching positions, while the rest hold&#13;
positions as school principals. Almost 45 percent of the teaching force is accountable to the&#13;
municipal authorities, 29 percent to government-subsidized private secondary school proprietors,&#13;
20 percent to private-paid secondary owners, and nearly 6 percent to the Corporations. There&#13;
are 163 secondary education supervisors in the system of which 74 percent are assigned to the S-&#13;
H track and 24 percent to the T-VOC track, yielding an approximate ratio of 9 publicly&#13;
subsidized schools per supervisor in the S-H track and 13 in the T-VOC track.&#13;

C. Relevant lssues in Secondary Education&#13;
2.13 The following diagnosis of Chile's secondary education system stems from: (i) 13&#13;
research studies financed under the MECE projecte'; (ii) a public consultation process involving&#13;
more than 35,000 parents, teachers, students, community leaders, and scholars, carried out&#13;
during 1992; (iii) an international workshop of secondary education scholars from around the&#13;
world, carried out in November of 1992; and (iv) a study tour of the secondary education&#13;
systems of Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia, carried out in 1992.&#13;
2.14 Chile's secondary education system has become increasingly outdated, inadequately&#13;
addressing new demands placed upon it by society and individuals in general. These new&#13;
demands stem from the global transformations associated with modernization which have&#13;
affected forms of production, family and social relationships, and political and cultural processes&#13;
and institutions. In the productive domain, modernization has implied increasingly complex&#13;
productive processes and rapid pace of technological change, which in turn has increased the&#13;
demand for a more flexible, retrainable and capable labor force. In the cultural sphere,&#13;
modernization has implied globalization of communications, resulting in an explosive expansion&#13;
of information and multi-media stimuli, which in turn requires that individuals have a much&#13;
deeper cognitive foundation than in the past. In the political domain, the emergence of a more&#13;
participatory and democratic order requires a better distribution of knowledge and societal codes,&#13;
which are key for ensuring social participation in public debate and decision making. Against&#13;
this backdrop of complex demands, there is consensus among experts and lay alike, that Chile's&#13;
secondary education institutions, curriculum, pedagogical processes and school practices, and&#13;
results are anachronistic, lacking, and inequitable. Thus the current secondary education system&#13;
in Chile is inadequately positioned to respond to societal, economic, and individual expectations.&#13;
2.15 The main issues affecting the Chilean secondary education system that will be addressed&#13;
by the project are: (a) low external efficiency manifested by the educational system's failure to&#13;
respond to the demands of individuals and to provide the higher-order thinking and problem-&#13;
solving skills required by tertiary education institutions, and the labor market; (b) low internal&#13;
efficiency reflected in high repetition and dropout rates, resulting in wastage of financial and&#13;
physical resources; (c) unacceptably low levels of quality indicated by low student cognitive&#13;
achievement; (d) high inequality expressed by the social distribution of educational opportunities&#13;
and results; and (e) weak institutional capacity to induce a modernization reform process.&#13;
2.16 External Inefficiency. There is a growing mismatch between the Chilean secondary&#13;
education's outcomes (student's levels of preparation) and the demands of individuals concerned,&#13;
3/    In the areas of curriculum development and evaluation results (4 studies),&#13;
pedagogical processes and school practices (3 studies), internal efficiency (1 study),&#13;
external efficiency (3 studies), pre and in-service teacher training (1 study), and&#13;
educational learning inputs (1 study)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
the productive sectors, and the higher education system. This mismatch is caused by: (i) a rigid&#13;
and outdated secondary education structure; (ii) low capacity to update and review curriculum&#13;
and study plans; and (iii) weak linkages to the productive sector, especially among T-VOC&#13;
schools.&#13;
2.17 The secondary education structure, conceived in the 1940s and consolidated in the 1960s,&#13;
requires that graduates from primary school, at age 14, choose between two tracks without any&#13;
subsequent possibility of changing. Presently S-H schools are oriented only toward preparing&#13;
students for the university, even though fewer than half of all its students actually enter a higher&#13;
education institution. On the other hand, T-VOC schools are oriented solely towards preparing&#13;
mid-level technicians, even though, according to the latest 1990 CASEN household survey, 63&#13;
percent of its graduates are not absorbed by the labor market a year after graduation.&#13;
2.18 The subject-based curriculum was last reviewed in 1981, before passage of LOCE (para.&#13;
2.6), when MINEDUC was still solely responsible for setting the curriculum for both tracks.&#13;
The curriculum has since undergone two slight modifications, in 1984 and 1989 respectively.&#13;
Nevertheless, since LOCE empowered MINEDUC with setting the core curriculum and the&#13;
secondary schools with the task of defining the complementary curriculum, study plans, and&#13;
syllabi, the system has been without the capacity to do so. Among schools, only some private-&#13;
paid secondary schools have had the technical skills required to design and implement their&#13;
supplementary curriculums. Most schools also lack the necessary instruments to implement the&#13;
intended core curriculum, something that tends to go undetected and unattended by MINEDUC.&#13;
2.19 The productive and service sectors are not consulted on the current contents of the T-&#13;
VOC curriculum or ways to improve it; setting of certification standards; vocational and&#13;
placement opportunities; or recommended strategies for carrying out student and in-service&#13;
teacher training programs. The poor response of the T-VOC track to labor market demands is&#13;
reflected by the highly fragmented subject-based curriculum which provides mainly over-specific&#13;
manual skills, and limits the provision of a minimum set of higher-order general and specific&#13;
skills4' and theoretical knowledge demanded by the modern, privately driven, export-oriented&#13;
Chilean economy. The Government has not created a favorable environment for expansion and&#13;
improvement of private sector involvement in preemployment vocational schooling provided by&#13;
the T-VOC secondary schools. An exception here is constituted by the 88 T-VOC secondary&#13;
schools administered by the Corporations, which are better funded, better equipped, and have a&#13;
4/    General skills such as: (i) reading, writing, performing arithmetic and mathematical&#13;
operations, listening, and speaking; (ii) thinking creatively, making decisions,&#13;
solving problems, visualizing, knowing how to learn, and reasoning; and (iii)&#13;
displaying responsibility, self-esteem, sociability, self-management, integrity, and&#13;
honesty. Specific skills such as: (iv) identifying, organizing, planning, and&#13;
allocating resources (time, money, materials, and people); (v) working with others&#13;
in a harmonious way; (vi) acquiring and using information; (vii) understanding&#13;
complex systemic inter-relationships; and (viii) working with a variety of&#13;
technologies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

closer relationship with a targeted group of enterprises than the rest of the municipal and private-&#13;
subsidized T-VOC secondary schools.&#13;
2.20 Internal Inefficiency. Although Chile has a high transition rate between primary and&#13;
secondary education and. a high gross enrollment rate at the secondary level (76 percent), as&#13;
compared with the weighted rate for Latin America (47 percent), low internal efficiency remains&#13;
an issue. Low coverage, especially among rural and at-risk populations, high repetition and&#13;
dropout rates, and an excessively long average time to complete the prescribed four-year&#13;
secondary cycle, result in high wastage of human and physical resources.&#13;
2.21 Coverage. About 24 percent of the 14 to 17 year-old cohort (230,000 individuals) are&#13;
not covered by the Chilean secondary education system. There are two possible explanations for&#13;
this situation. From the demand side, it is possible that youngsters perceive completing&#13;
secondary education as having a high opportunity cost. This hypothesis is substantiated by tracer&#13;
studies showing that, for example: (i) S-H students who dropped out after their second year&#13;
gained employment at a rate similar to that of students finishing the full four years; and&#13;
(ii) students from the T-VOC track who dropped out after their second year had higher&#13;
employment levels than their S-H counterparts who actually finished the full secondary education&#13;
four-year cycle. This demand side hypothesis seems to be supported by the progressively&#13;
deteriorating rate of return to secondary education in Chile (Annex C, Table C-8). From the&#13;
supply side, circumstantial evidence indicates that some students, especially in marginal urban&#13;
and rural areas, lack access to secondary schools. This seems to be mainly a result of: (a) lack&#13;
of physical facilities that would be too costly to build and operate in remote rural areas; and&#13;
(b) inadequate special assistance programs to cover the costs of transportation, tuition, and&#13;
subsistence.&#13;
2.22 Repetition and Dropout Rates. Overall repetition at the secondary level was estimated&#13;
at 12 percent in 1993. Repetition was highest in the first grade of secondary education at 16.2&#13;
percent and remained high through the third grade before it decreased to 5.6 percent in the&#13;
fourth grade. Municipal schools show a repetition rate of 14.4 percent, which compared to&#13;
subsidized (11 percent), Corporations (9.8 percent), and private-paid schools (4 percent), is&#13;
significantly higher (Annex C, Table C-9). Average repetition rates are higher in the T-VOC&#13;
track (13.5 percent) than in the S-H modality (11 percent). Regions II (Antofagasta), III&#13;
(Atacama), IX (La Araucanfa), and XI (Aisen) registered the highest repetition rates in the&#13;
country ranging from 14 to nearly 18 percent (Annex C, Table C-10). The average dropout rate&#13;
for secondary education was 6.7 percent in 1992 (Annex C, Table C-9). The incidence of&#13;
dropout was highest during the first three years of the secondary cycle, especially the first year&#13;
which averaged 9.8 percent. A comparison by type of school shows that the dropout rate was&#13;
highest in municipal schools (8.4 percent), followed by private-subsidized (5.8 percent),&#13;
Corporations (5.4 percent), and private-paid schools (2.5 percent). Average dropout rates are&#13;
slightly higher in the T-VOC track (7.1 percent) than in the S-H modality (6.6 percent).&#13;
Regions I (Tarapaca), HI (Atacama), IX (La Araucanfa), and XI (Aisen) registered the highest&#13;
dropout rates in the country ranging from 7.8 to 8.1 percent (Annex C, Table C-10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
2.23 Average Time to Complete the Secondary Education Cycle. The average time to&#13;
complete the prescribed four-year secondary cycle is 5.3 years, down from 5.7 years in the late&#13;
seventies. This shows a secondary education cohort completion-rate increase from 62.3 percent&#13;
to 68 percent for the 1975-80 and 1985-90 cohorts, respectively. At the outset, these data reveal&#13;
improvements in the system's internal efficiency. However, cohort analysis by types of&#13;
secondary schools indicates a different situation. The average completion time was markedly&#13;
higher among municipal schools (5.7 years), while lower in private-subsidized schools (5 years),&#13;
and lower still in private-paid schools (4.4 years) (Annex C, Table C-11). In terms of&#13;
completion rates for the 1985-90 cohort, 61.6 percent of students from municipal secondary&#13;
schools completed the cycle, compared to 73.6 percent from private-subsidized schools and 87.7&#13;
percent from private-paid schools. These inefficiencies, compounded with the ones manifested&#13;
in the basic cycle (late primary school entrance, and high repetition and dropout rates in the first&#13;
two grades, for example), cause nearly 31 percent of those enrolled in the first grade of&#13;
secondary education, and 32 percent in the second grade, to lag behind the expected standard age&#13;
(Annex C, Table C-12).&#13;
2.24 The system's low internal efficiency results from: (i) the unavailability of learning inputs&#13;
such as textbooks, school libraries, teaching materials, computer resources, and essential&#13;
infrastructure; (ii) the lack of teachers trained in modern pedagogical techniques and the use of&#13;
learning inputs; (iii) inadequately targeted special-assistance programs for low-income students;&#13;
and (iv) the lack of a curricular alternatives program for at-risk students.&#13;
2.25 Low Quality. Chile's secondary education system displays unsatisfactory levels of&#13;
learning in key areas (especially among low-income students), and deficient internal5' and&#13;
external' evaluation measuring systems to monitor student and system performance. A&#13;
nationally representative evaluation in Spanish, math, and general abilities2' was carried out in&#13;
1992. The measurement in Spanish revealed that the average of correct answers for 9th, 10th,&#13;
and 12th grade students from the private-paid subsystem was slightly over 50 percent, whereas&#13;
Sl     Through internal evaluations (essays, quizzes, tests, homework, and classroom&#13;
questions), teachers discover what students already know and what they still need to&#13;
learn. Internal evaluations are early-warning signs of learning problems, and&#13;
effective detection mechanisms of high-risk students, which teachers can then correct&#13;
before they worsen.&#13;
6/l    Through external evaluations by means of standardized tests, educational authorities&#13;
discover the discrepancies between the intended (official) curriculum, the one being&#13;
taught by the teachers, and the one being learned by the students. External&#13;
evaluations are used to measure achievement of national educational goals, targets,&#13;
and policies.&#13;
7/     The test was carried out by a team of specialists contracted by MINEDUC. The&#13;
team used a random sample of 6,000 students from 6 different regions, attending&#13;
138 secondary schools of both types. The test criterion used was the minimum&#13;
levels of achievement defined for the different tested grades in the official syllabus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
students from the municipal and private-subsidized schools attained only between 39 and 48&#13;
percent of correct answers. For math, the results were even worse, with the elite of private-paid&#13;
schools answering around 40 percent of the questions correctly, and the municipal and private-&#13;
subsidized schools achieving between 20 and 29 percent correctly. These tests also seem to&#13;
indicate that student achievement in Spanish and math worsens as they progress through the&#13;
secondary system (Annex C, Table C-13). Low learning is generated by: (i) the use of outdated&#13;
pedagogical practices; (ii) the lack of appropriate learning inputs; and (iii) the lack of internal&#13;
evaluation instruments.&#13;
2.26 Pedagogical Practices. The predominant teaching practices in the Chilean secondary&#13;
education system are characterized by their recourse to traditional "frontal teaching" forms&#13;
manifested by: excessive use of dictation; strong emphasis on drilling; unilateral transmission of&#13;
information by the teacher; strict correspondence between what is directly taught and what is&#13;
tested in internal evaluations; and the rare use of textbooks, teaching materials, computers,&#13;
school libraries, and project research methodologies. Available evidence suggests that teaching&#13;
materials are not presented in a rational, orderly, and integrated fashion, and that students are&#13;
not allowed to practice and apply what they have learned, particularly with regard to integrating&#13;
knowledge taught with their own life experiences.&#13;
2.27 Teachers are a key factor in delivering quality educational services. There is evidence to&#13;
suggest that many secondary education teachers lack the necessary knowledge of the subject&#13;
matter, while others lack modern teaching practices. Supervisors on the other hand, are&#13;
supposed to provide support to directors and teachers at the school and classroom level.&#13;
Presently, however, supervisors for secondary education are ill-prepared to carry out their&#13;
functions appropriately, due to: (a) a lack of preparation on appropriate classroom problem-&#13;
solving pedagogical strategies and techniques; and (b) insufficient resources to serve the large&#13;
number of existing schools and teachers. As a result, most rural secondary schools are not&#13;
visited by the supervisors during the school year.&#13;
2.28 Learning Inputs. The use of learning inputs (textbooks, teaching materials, teacher&#13;
guides, school libraries, computers, and school infrastructure) in an appropriate manner has been&#13;
shown to increase the quality of education. Chile does not have an official policy concerning the&#13;
availability and use of educational inputs in secondary schools. In striking contrast to primary&#13;
education, MINEDUC neither distributes texts to secondary students, nor provides guidelines for&#13;
teachers on their correct application. Consequently, manufacturers of learning and teaching&#13;
materials lack the necessary signals needed to guide their design and supply. Also, there is&#13;
limited institutional capacity, both at MINEDUC and among teachers, to correctly evaluate&#13;
learning materials available in the market.&#13;
2.29 Since textbooks are not required, MINEDUC does not attempt to ensure that books&#13;
currently used are adequate. Suggested bibliographies are based more on what has been&#13;
historically used in different subject areas than on any careful consideration on their content.&#13;
Still, textbooks are used in some schools, especially private-paid schools, while in other schools,&#13;
photocopies of old editions are common. When textbooks are used, they often contain exercises&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
and lessons that fail to promote higher-order skills. Municipal and subsidized schools often have&#13;
an inadequate supply of supplementary teaching materials such as globes and educational videos,&#13;
slide projectors, natural science kits, and physics and chemistry sets; lack laboratories and&#13;
workshops, in spite of the existing S-H study plan requiring their use; and also lack more&#13;
expensive but still cost-effective resources, such as classroom libraries and computers. Private&#13;
and Corporation schools have a larger, yet still inadequate, supply of these materials. Most&#13;
schools lack educational computer software, which has become a promising alternative to&#13;
laboratory and workshop equipment for science teaching.&#13;
2.30 Many secondary schools lack the essential infrastructure necessary to comply with&#13;
MINEDUC's requirements. Data from 1985 show that 22.5 percent of schools do not have&#13;
adequate space or facilities to carry out their programs of study. When schools that combine&#13;
primary and secondary school classes are considered, the above figure rises to 28.3 percent.&#13;
2.31 Evaluation. Neither MINEDUC nor schools and teachers currently have the capacity to&#13;
adequately monitor and evaluate the implementation of the intended curriculum and student&#13;
performance. The absence of proper internal and external evaluations in Chile has contributed to&#13;
the reduction or dilution of educational content, and has deprived the system of key self-&#13;
correction and monitoring mechanisms, with serious implications for the quality of teaching and&#13;
student results. Teachers tend to evaluate students mainly by their memorization of fragmented&#13;
information taught by them. Up to 1992, there was no cognitive achievement measuring system&#13;
for secondary education. The Bank-financed MECE project laid the groundwork for establishing&#13;
one, which led to a pilot test in 1992.&#13;
2.32 Inequities. Inequities in the delivery and quality of secondary school services are&#13;
reflected by disparities in: (i) participation rates; (ii) type of schools attended; (iii) standardized&#13;
academic achievement; and (iv) access to higher education and employment outcomes.&#13;
2.33 Participation Rates. Only 73 percent of the lowest-income quintile individuals of&#13;
secondary school age have access to the system. When they do, they usually attend lower-&#13;
quality municipal secondary schools. Meanwhile, 96 percent of the higher-income quintile&#13;
individuals participate, most by attending the better-equipped private-paid schools (Annex C,&#13;
Table C-14). Nearly 52 percent of the rural 14 to 17 year-old cohort does not attend secondary&#13;
school (Annex C, Table C-15). Distribution of secondary educational coverage by region&#13;
reveals differences of up to 25 percentage points - the first region has the highest coverage (92&#13;
percent) while the VII, IX and X regions have less than 67 percent (Annex C, Table C-15).&#13;
Only 59 percent of municipal schools students finish the full cycle in comparison to 88 percent&#13;
of students attending private-paid secondary schools. It takes municipal secondary students an&#13;
average of 1.3 more years to graduate from the four-year cycle than private-paid students.&#13;
2.34 Type of School Attended. There is a clear relation between a student's socio-economic&#13;
status and the type of school attended: 82 percent of municipal school enrollments come from&#13;
low-income households, compared to only 58 percent from private-subsidized schools.&#13;
Conversely, private-paid school enrollments are almost solely made up of students from upper-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
income households (Annex C, Table C-16). Not surprisingly, students from private-paid elite&#13;
schools are vastly over-represented in the university system, and hold some of the best positions&#13;
in the labor market. Among the publicly funded schools, municipal schools are clearly the most&#13;
disadvantaged in preparing students for insertion to the labor market and the higher education&#13;
system, followed by private-subsidized schools and then by the Corporations, which are almost&#13;
an elite among this latter group of schools.&#13;
2.35 Standardized Academic Achievement. A test administered in 1992 shows that for&#13;
Spanish skills, about one-fourth of the municipal S-H schools and more than half of the T-VOC&#13;
secondary schools, which are almost solely attended by low-income students, ranked at the&#13;
lowest levels. With regards to math skills, nearly 40 percent of all municipal S-H and T-VOC&#13;
schools ranked at the lowest end of the spectrum. By contrast, over half the private-paid schools&#13;
ranked at the upper level in both Spanish and math (Annex C, Table C-17).&#13;
2.36 Higher Education and Employment Outcomes. Nowhere are the secondary school&#13;
system's inequalities more evident than in students' access to tertiary education and employment&#13;
opportunities. Only five percent of those belonging to the lowest-income households continue&#13;
onto tertiary education, compared to 45 percent of those belonging to higher-income households.&#13;
About 18 percent of low-income household graduates would be unemployed after graduating&#13;
from secondary school, compared to two percent of student coming from higher-income&#13;
households (Annex C, Table C-18). For a society like the Chilean, which states its adherence&#13;
to principles of equality of opportunity and social mobility, the inequality of the secondary&#13;
school system is a worrisome issue. Similarly, for a society that is increasingly aware of the&#13;
value of its human resources, the costs of wasting the talent of the majority is also a major issue.&#13;
2.37 Weak Sectoral Institutional Capability. Since early 1993, the Bank-assisted MECE&#13;
project (Ln. 3410-CH) has been financing several activities to strengthen managerial skills at all&#13;
levels of the education system (central, regional, provincial, municipal, and school level). These&#13;
activities have involved: (i) staff training; (ii) development and delivery of operational manuals;&#13;
(iii) provision of office and communication equipment (vehicles, photocopiers, computers and&#13;
peripheral equipment and software, fax machines, and office furniture); and (iv) strengthening of&#13;
the management information system (MIS). Nevertheless, due to initial implementation delays,&#13;
institutional weaknesses persist. Consequently, many reforms and interventions which had been&#13;
programmed in order to address problems of efficiency, quality, and equity at the primary level&#13;
are still pending.&#13;
2.38 Weak institutional capacity stems primarily from the limited ability of: (a) MINEDUC to&#13;
effectively translate educational policies and strategies into concrete programs, target resources&#13;
to deprived schools through the municipalities, and periodically monitor sector achievements;&#13;
(b) the municipalities to execute educational programs derived from sector policies, and&#13;
administer the resources of municipal schools in an efficient manner; and (c) school&#13;
administrators to adequately implement technical-pedagogical supervision and school&#13;
management programs. Of the activities programmed to date, MINEDUC has effectively&#13;
supplied all administrative offices at the central and decentralized levels with office and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
telecommunication equipment and vehicles. Meanwhile, the activities which are behind schedule&#13;
are: (i) strengthening managerial skills at all levels of decision-making through training; (ii)&#13;
developing practical manuals for planning, programming, and monitoring; and (iii) strengthening&#13;
of the sector's MIS.&#13;
2.39 Financing and Expenditure Issues. Chile's public spending on education (from both,&#13;
central and municipal own-generated resources) declined significantly from 5.5 percent of GDP&#13;
in 1982 to 2.8 percent in 1990 before increasing slightly to 3.0 percent in 1992. As a share of&#13;
total public expenditures, public education spending decreased from 12.3 percent in 1982 to 9.1&#13;
in 1988 and then increased to 11.2 percent in 1992 (Annex D, Table D-1). The increments&#13;
registered in public education spending since 1992 are largely a result of the: (i) increases in&#13;
school subsidies; (ii) increases in teachers salaries due to the enactment of the Teachers Statute&#13;
Law (1991); and (iii) Bank-financed MECE project (Ln 3410-CH). Despite this slight recovery,&#13;
public financing of education is still characterized by a general level of underinvestment, limited&#13;
funding sources, and the concentration of expenditures on recurrent salaries.&#13;
2.40 Underinvestment in Education. Public education sector spending in Chile, at 3.2&#13;
percent of GDP, is still low compared to the 4 percent of GDP spent in Latin America as a&#13;
whole, 4.4 percent in Latin America's middle-income countries, and 6.4 in the OECD countries&#13;
(Annex D, Table D-2). Chile devotes only 11.2 percent of its budget to education, which also is&#13;
small relative to the LAC average of 16.6 percent, yet only slightly below the share assigned by&#13;
OECD countries (12.8 percent). Chile's per-student spending on pre-university education was&#13;
about US$320 in 1992!', about twice the average of US$171 for upper middle-income countries&#13;
worldwide, yet only one-tenth the approximate OECD average of US$3,500 per year.&#13;
2.41 Sources of Funding. Almost 52 percent of spending in education in 1992, including&#13;
funds from the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Regional (FNDR) and the subsidy transfers to the&#13;
municipal and the private-subsidized schools, came from the federal budget. Overall, the share&#13;
of private contribution to education has kept pace with increases in public financing. The&#13;
greatest increase in private financing has been at the university level, where payments grew in&#13;
the 1989-92 period from 19 percent of total educational spending to over 21 percent (or roughly&#13;
40 percent of total private funding). The pre-university level private funding experienced a&#13;
slight decrease from 31 percent in 1989 to 29 percent in 1992 (Annex D, Table D-3).&#13;
2.42 Recurrent Salary Expenditures. According to 1992 data, nearly 80 percent of all&#13;
public educational expenditure is allocated to teachers' salaries and social benefits, somewhat&#13;
below the Latin America average of about 85 percent. Meanwhile, the remaining is used as&#13;
follows: 16.8 percent is transferred to 20 public and private universities; 2.6 percent for&#13;
recurrent operating costs; 0.8 percent for school construction and maintenance; and 0.3 percent&#13;
for textbook provision (Annex D, Table D-4). The 1992 outlays for textbooks and teaching&#13;
materials increased 275 percent compared to 1990, as a consequence of implementing MECE.&#13;
8/    This increases to about US$367 per student for all educational levels if subsidies to&#13;
higher education are also included.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
2.43 Distribution of Expenditures. Public expenditure on education has increased by 0.4&#13;
percent per annum in real terms since 1980. This trend is observable across most educational&#13;
levels, albeit at different annual rates: preschool education 3.1 percent; basic education 2.9&#13;
percent; and T-VOC secondary education 3.2 percent. The exceptions are in the S-H secondary&#13;
education track and the transfers to higher education, which have decreased by 0.1 and 4.3&#13;
percent respectively (Annex D, Table D-5). Noteworthy are the following trends observed&#13;
during the 1980-92 period: preschool expenditures, as a proportion of total educational&#13;
expenditures, rose from 6.1 percent to 8.4 percent; primary education expenditures rose from&#13;
39.6 to 53.1 percent; expenditures on T-VOC secondary education track climbed from 5.3&#13;
percent to 7.4 percent; while spending in the S-H secondary track and higher education transfers&#13;
decreased from 8.8 to 8.3 percent and 35.2 to 19.8 percent, respectively (Annex D, Table D-6).&#13;
The increases in preschool and primary education are a consequence of MECE, increases in&#13;
teachers' salaries and school subsidies.&#13;
D. Government Sectoral Objectives and Strategy&#13;
2.44 In contrast to primary education, where extensive research and policy proposals laid the&#13;
groundwork for MECE, secondary education lacked an analytical base to guide any&#13;
interventions. The Aylwin Government assigned its educational spending priority to preschool&#13;
and primary education, since it was acutely aware of the need to start from the lower levels&#13;
upwards. Concurrently with implementing the MECE project, the Aylwin Government initiated&#13;
activities aimed at developing a strategy for improving secondary education. For instance, with&#13;
financing from the MECE project, MINEDUC carried out 13 studies in 1992-93 (para. 2.13).&#13;
Additionally, a public consultative process which included more than 35,000 educational system&#13;
stakeholders was carried out during 1992 to inform and raise the level of awareness regarding&#13;
issues facing the subsector, and to gather stakeholder's views on these issues. Furthermore, a&#13;
workshop was held in Santiago in November 1992, attended by international scholars in the&#13;
field, to review the worldwide experience in dealing with secondary education issues and to&#13;
propose possible solutions. Finally, a study tour was carried out in 1992 by key sectoral actors&#13;
in charge of policy design, in conjunction with Bank staff assisting project preparation, to&#13;
observe the secondary education systems in Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia.&#13;
2.45 The Frei Government has built on this work and raised education to a new order of&#13;
priority. The Minister of Finance announced on August of 1994, that education would top the&#13;
Government's priority list during its 6-year term. By acknowledging the importance of&#13;
education in achieving sustained economic growth, the Government will significantly increase the&#13;
percent of GDP devoted to education, with a target of 7 percent to be reached in the next 8&#13;
years. This increase would have to be assumed and shared by both the public and private&#13;
sectors. Some of the future investments outlined by the Minister for the education sector include:&#13;
(i) modernization of the curriculum; (ii) improved school effectiveness and efficiency; and&#13;
(iii) improved management of the sector. The Government also made public the results of an&#13;
Advisory Committee on the Modernization of the Education Sector, specially commissioned by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
the President, titled "Los Desaftos de la Educacidn Chilena Frente a! Siglo 21 v. This&#13;
document recommends: (i) enhancing the quality. of basic and secondary education;&#13;
(ii) reforming secondary education; (iii) strengthening the teaching profession; (iv) providing&#13;
more flexibility to sector management; and (v) increasing public and private sector financing of&#13;
the sector. This document will serve as the groundwork for forging a consensus regarding a&#13;
future "Structural Reform" envisioned for Chile's education system.&#13;
2.46 With inputs from the studies, the workshop and public consultation, the Government has&#13;
devised a working strategy to improve secondary education in three sequential, and&#13;
complementary, steps. The first step involved the implementation of a "Pilot Program' during&#13;
the second semester of 1994, comprising limited targeted activities for approximately 100,000&#13;
students in 124 secondary schools throughout the country. Second, starting in January 1995, the&#13;
Government initiated the execution of a more comprehensive "Quality Improvement Program&#13;
(MECE-EM)" comprising a wide range of activities which address the system's overall low&#13;
quality, internal and external inefficiencies, and inequities in all publicly financed secondary&#13;
schools. The Pilot Program was utilized as a testing ground for the design and implementation&#13;
of certain activities included in MECE-EM. The third phase, to be carried out by the end of the&#13;
decade, consists of the implementation of a "Structural Reform" for the secondary education&#13;
system, based on the results of MECE-EM and the consensus which is expected to emerge from&#13;
the work of the Presidential Advisory Committee.&#13;
2.47 Pilot Program. This program has channeled US$5.4 million towards the: (a) acquisition&#13;
of books for school libraries and teaching materials; (b) provision of computer equipment;&#13;
(c) provision of essential school infrastructure to house the library, computer equipment, and&#13;
teacher's rooms; (d) implementation of alternative curricular activities for at-risk students; and&#13;
(e) provision of in-service teacher training. The 124 participating schools were selected on the&#13;
basis of vulnerability21, low scores in academic achievement tests, a minimum enrollment of&#13;
500 students per school, and low mobility of its teaching personnel. The pilot program has been&#13;
absorbed by the larger MECE-EM project (para. 2.48).&#13;
2.48 Quality Improvement Project (MECE-EM). The Government is financing the&#13;
execution of MECE-EM in CY95 with counterpart funds amounting to US$13.4 million. The&#13;
activities included under this project rest upon three sets of actions, and are aimed at the publicly&#13;
financed secondary schools. First, actions to: (i) enhance the teaching and learning of higher-&#13;
order thinking and problem-solving skills; (ii) develop evaluation capacity; (iii) establish&#13;
alternative curricular activities to address students' expectations and demands in their&#13;
supplementary time; and (iv) develop new links between the secondary school system and the&#13;
private productive sector. Second, actions to: (v) change teaching and school practices;&#13;
9/    Using the vulnerability methodology designed and implemented by the Junta&#13;
Nacional de Auxilio Escolar y Becas (JUNAEB). This methodology comprises: the&#13;
student's socio-economic and nutritional status; the school's repetition and dropout&#13;
rates; and the school classification as determined by a nation-wide poverty map.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
(vi) promote grassroots (teachers, directors and supervisors) participation in designing and&#13;
implementing school-based quality development projects; and (vii) provide learning inputs&#13;
comprising textbooks, teaching materials, school libraries, computing equipment and software,&#13;
infrastructure and technical assistance. Third, actions to continue strengthening sectoral&#13;
management. The Bank has been requested to assist in the financing of some of the above-&#13;
mentioned components.&#13;
2.49 Structural Reform. The Government recognizes that the present basic eight-grade&#13;
compulsory education system is obsolete, since the majority of its graduates go on to a&#13;
secondary education system that is outdated from the standpoint of its social, educational, and&#13;
skill contents. There is clearly a need to redefine the length of compulsory education in the&#13;
context of the modernization trends currently shaping the Chilean society. According to the&#13;
available evidence, this plan is consistent with changes that other secondary education structures&#13;
(in more developed economies, and the Pacific Rim countries) have made to their curricula,&#13;
teaching methods and school practices. Based on the evaluated results of the Pilot Program and&#13;
the Bank-financed MECE-EM, as well as the consensus which emerges from the forthcoming&#13;
national debate, reforms could be structured along the following lines: (a) extension of the length&#13;
of compulsory education from 8 to 10 years; (b) postponement of the decision period for&#13;
choosing between the S-H and T-VOC track until the end of the 10th grade (at the age of 16)&#13;
rather than at the current 8th grade (at the age of 14); (c) enhancement of the teaching and&#13;
learning of higher-order thinking and problem-solving skills in the newly defined subject-based&#13;
curriculum to be provided in the compulsory secondary cycle (9th and 10th grades); and (d)&#13;
more differentiation in the non-compulsory secondary cycle (11th and 12th grades), with&#13;
connecting channels allowing for second choices, so that the S-H track would not be exclusively&#13;
oriented towards university studies, and the T-VOC track would stop being conceived as dead-&#13;
end and specialized in terms of specific job positions, and thus become more attuned to&#13;
changeable occupational markets.&#13;
E. Bank Role and Strategy&#13;
2.50 To date, the Bank has supported four projects in Chile's education sector. The first two&#13;
(Vocational Training Project, Ln. 0431-CH for US$2.7 million, and Second Vocational Training&#13;
Project, Ln. 0666-CH for US$1.5 million, approved in 1965 and 1970, respectively) were aimed&#13;
at expanding the training capacity of the National Institute for Vocational Training (INACAP).&#13;
The projects were successfully implemented, and assisted in making INACAP an outstanding&#13;
training institution. The third project (Third Education Project, Ln. 0668-CH for US$7.0&#13;
million, approved in 1970) supported the MINEDUC in its efforts to expand and improve&#13;
primary teacher training colleges and technical agricultural secondary schools. This project was&#13;
implemented prematurely since the country's policies in this area were only in their formative&#13;
stage at the time. Furthermore, project implementation coincided with a period of political&#13;
turmoil, which contributed to many project objectives not being achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.51 The fourth project (MECE, Ln. 3410-CH for US$170 million, approved in 1991),&#13;
currently under execution, aims to assist the Government in: (a) enhancing the efficiency,&#13;
quality, and equity of primary education in selected schools in targeted rural and urban areas;&#13;
(b) expanding coverage and enhancing the quality of preschool education to increase primary&#13;
school preparedness and reduce late entry, repetition, and dropout rates, especially targeted to 5-&#13;
year-old children living in poverty conditions; (c) strengthening the institutional capacity of&#13;
MINEDUC, its regional and provincial educational departments, and the municipalities, as well&#13;
as the managerial skills of principals in municipal and private subsidized preschool and primary&#13;
school; and (d) assessing alternative cost-effective approaches to meet the secondary education&#13;
needs of primary graduates. Project execution is progressing satisfactorily. Many components&#13;
(school-based quality improvement projects-PMEs; the school computer network; rural micro-&#13;
centers; distribution of textbooks, reading resource centers and teaching materials; health&#13;
screening and referral; civil works; and the distribution of office equipment, vehicles,&#13;
computers, and supplies to MINEDUC's decentralized offices) have exceeded expected targets.&#13;
As of December 31, 1994, the project has disbursed over 35 percent of the total loan. In&#13;
addition to these projects, the Bank has assisted the Government during the past decade with 23&#13;
projects, amounting to approximately US$2.4 billion, in the following sectors: infrastructure&#13;
(eight projects), housing (two projects), health (two projects), public sector enterprise (one&#13;
project), technical assistance (four projects), and structural adjustment (six projects). These&#13;
projects have helped the Government to attain macroeconomic stability, adopt a market&#13;
economy, liberalize trade, and promote private sector participation.&#13;
2.52  The Govemment of Chile and the Bank have recently agreed upon a new assistance&#13;
modality that reflects Chile's continued desire for the Bank's technical assistance and advisory&#13;
services along with its reduced need for resource transfers in view of its strong external position.&#13;
The first Country Assistance Strategy document for Chile, which reflects this new assistance&#13;
modality, is being prepared for Board consideration in May 1994. A fundamental feature of the&#13;
Bank's strategy is the emphasis on selectivity, focussing both sector work and limited new&#13;
lending exclusively on key areas identified by the Government as priorities in its development&#13;
agenda. One of these determinant areas in which the Government has requested Bank assistance&#13;
is the education sector. The education sector has been singled out as this Administration's&#13;
highest priority, both to increase productivity and to improve further social conditions. The&#13;
Government looks for the Bank's assistance in this project in view of our already close&#13;
involvement under previous and ongoing operations in the sector. The Government also seeks to&#13;
benefit from the Bank's international experience in the field of secondary education, considered&#13;
of fundamental importance towards improving the country's international competitiveness and&#13;
meeting its future economic growth objectives. The project is consequently fully consistent with&#13;
the country assistance strategy for Chile.&#13;
2.53 Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The IDB approved in 1994 a US$60 million&#13;
Training Program Loan for Chile aimed at assisting SENCE to provide non-formal training to&#13;
unskilled workers from all sectors of the economy in order to increase their productivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

F. Lessons LearnedLo'&#13;
2.54 Sustainability. To ensure that Bank-financed education projects will continue to produce&#13;
benefits beyond their completion, countries need to develop or maintain a sense of project&#13;
ownership. Involving policy-makers and technical staff from the early stages of project&#13;
identification and design is one of the best strategies to achieve this goal. Also, local&#13;
involvement in project preparation helps to ensure that project goals are in agreement with&#13;
national goals. Other elements of project sustainability are: (i) defining both long- and short-&#13;
term project objectives so as to facilitate implementation, monitoring, and evaluation;&#13;
(ii) addressing from the very beginning the issue of counterpart funding; and (iii) addressing the&#13;
issue of institutional strengthening for project implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.&#13;
During preparation of the MECE-EM project, MINEDUC, through the Project Preparation Unit&#13;
(PPU) of MECE, has taken an active role in defining the project. Project implementation is&#13;
envisaged through the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of MECE, modified to allow&#13;
simultaneous coordination of the Bank-financed secondary education project (MECE-EM) and&#13;
transferring of the day to day coordination of MECE to MINEDUC. The PCU would be part of&#13;
MINEDUC's organizational structure. Furthermore, the Government has allocated counterpart&#13;
funds in its Budget Law of CY95 for MECE-EM amounting to US$ 13.4 million equivalent.&#13;
During appraisal the Government made available the necessary counterpart funding information&#13;
required for project execution for 1996 through 2000 (para. 7.2(d)).&#13;
2.55 Textbooks, School-Libraries, and Teaching Materials. The success of a textbook,&#13;
school library and teaching material component is directly related to the extent to which the&#13;
project design addresses all aspects of their selection, publication or procurement, distribution,&#13;
storage, usage, and financing. The key problems encountered in this component are:&#13;
(i) incapacity to supply books and teaching materials continuously due to lack of funding,&#13;
10/    This section is based on: (i) a review of 24 Project Performance Audit Reports&#13;
(PPAR), project completion Reports, and Staff Appraisal Reports from the LAC,&#13;
Asia, and Africa regions, as well as the Form 590-Supervision Reports for MECE&#13;
(Loan 3410-Ch); (ii) recommendations from the following Bank documents and&#13;

- 20 -&#13;
inadequate institutional arrangements, and poor distribution and coordination; (ii) inadequate&#13;
attention to the selection of book and teaching material and evaluation of their use by the&#13;
teachers and students; (iii) neglect of aspects related to book and teaching material utilization,&#13;
such as teacher and parents' training; and (iv) conflicts between government and local publishers&#13;
and teaching material manufacturers. MECE-EM will address these issues by: (i) establishing a&#13;
policy on the use of quality textbooks and instructional materials; (ii) sending signals to&#13;
manufacturers of textbooks and instructional materials to guide their supply; and (iii) developing&#13;
institutional capacity to choose learning materials available in the market, involving teachers in&#13;
the selection and evaluation of learning materials. MECE-EM has incorporated the experience&#13;
gained in the execution of MECE's textbook componente since 1992.&#13;
2.56 In-service Teacher Training. Support for in-service teacher training should distinguish&#13;
activities designed to certify untrained teachers from activities geared to upgrading the skills and&#13;
knowledge of current teachers. In the latter case a distinction should be made between&#13;
improving general subject matter knowledge and improving teaching skills, especially with the&#13;
use of textbooks and reading materials. The latter programs are generally successful when they&#13;
are designed and implemented in the teacher's work environment. MECE-EM builds upon three&#13;
years experience derived from the execution of MECE's in-service teacher training component.&#13;
MECE-EM will include an intensive, locally initiated and implemented teacher training&#13;
component to upgrade teachers' skills in the use of textbooks, school libraries, teaching&#13;
materials, and computers, as well as in the design and implementation of school-based quality&#13;
development subprojects.&#13;
2.57 Evaluation. To develop the country's assessment capabilities it is necessary to: (i) define&#13;
assessment policies and objectives, and disseminate results; and (ii) incorporate trained&#13;
psychometricians and statisticians as part of the required staff. Moreover, it is desirable to:&#13;
(i) operate the system outside the govemment, maintaining in the latter only the formulation of&#13;
assessment policies, test development and monitoring, and dissemination of results; and&#13;
(ii) allocate funds to research the assessment information being collected. Chile has developed a&#13;
reliable standardized measuring system for cognitive achievement in basic education. This&#13;
experience is being incorporated into the evaluation component of MECE-EM.&#13;
2.58 Institutional Development. For central and decentralized management to be effective it&#13;
is essential to have: (i) a political commitment to implement the changes advocated; (ii) a&#13;
rational distribution of responsibilities between central and regional authorities, in which the&#13;
former provides direction, formulates policy, monitors achievement, and performs evaluations,&#13;
and the latter operates and manages the day-to-day activities of the sector; (iii) accountability of&#13;
authorities; (iv) adequate resources; and (v) an implementation strategy. MECE-EM builds upon&#13;
the institutional strengthening activities implemented by MECE to strengthen the decentralization&#13;
process and sectoral managerial capability.&#13;
2.59 All of these lessons, as well as the Bank's worldwide experience, have been taken into&#13;
account in the design of the project.&#13;

3. PROJECT OBJECTIMS AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
3.1   The project (MECE-EM) seeks to improve the internal and external efficiency, quality,&#13;
and equity of all the municipal and government-subsidized private secondary schools (about&#13;
1,600), and to strengthen sectoral managerial capacity.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.2   MECE-EM would improve external efficiency by: (a) establishing a Curriculum&#13;
Planning and Evaluation Unit (CPEU) to reformulate the subject-based curriculum, for both the&#13;
scientific-humanistic (S-H) and technical-vocational (T-VOC) secondary schools, to enhance the&#13;
teaching and learning of higher-order thinking and problem-solving skills; (b) developing&#13;
evaluation capacity to monitor the consistency between the recommended (official) and the&#13;
learned curriculum; (c) establishing alternative curricular activities for socially and educationally&#13;
at-risk secondary students; and (d) providing incentives to strengthen the linkages between&#13;
targeted T-VOC secondary schools and the private sector in curriculum development, skill&#13;
certification, in-service teacher training, and the use of physical facilities. vECE-EM would&#13;
improve quality, equity, and internal efficiency by: (e) providing in-service teacher training to&#13;
change the predominantly one-dimensional teaching format based mainly on rote learning and&#13;
dictation, to more interactive methods; (f) establishing a fund to promote the design and&#13;
implementation of school-based educational development projects (PDEs); and (g) providing&#13;
educational resources (textbooks, school libraries, teaching materials, computers, and&#13;
infrastructure) in a targeted manner. MECE-EM would strengthen sectoral managerial&#13;
capacity by: (h) building upon existing institutional strengthening activities financed by the&#13;
Bank-assisted Primary Education Loan (Ln 3410-CH, MECE) within the current administrative&#13;
structure of the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) and the municipalities; (i) strengthening the&#13;
managerial and leadership capacity of principals and the heads of school-curricular subject areas;&#13;
and (j) establishing and maintaining a technical support network (TSN) consisting of universities,&#13;
professional institutes, local and international experts, the private sector, and NGOs which would&#13;
provide technical assistance to participating secondary schools in training, development of&#13;
learning materials and curricular needs.&#13;
3.3   MECE-EM would provide school libraries, teaching materials and textbooks to all&#13;
participating schools during the first three years of the project. The remaining components of&#13;
MECE-EM would be implemented during the project's six year life and would cover schools&#13;
based on their demand for services offered and their fulfillment of the following criteria: (a)&#13;
implementation of in-service teacher training activities; (b) qualification as determined by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
indicators which measure the schools' vulnerabilityl' relative to other schools; and&#13;
(c) unavailability of educational inputs similar to those allocated by the project as determined by&#13;
an inventory which would be carried out during the first year of project execution.&#13;
3.4   Reformulation of Curriculum and Development of Evaluation Capacity (US$ 5.2&#13;
million; 3.0 percent of total baseline cost). This component comprises the: (i) reformulation of&#13;
curriculum; and (ii) development of evaluation capacity. Curriculum reformulation would aim to&#13;
enhance the teaching and learning of higher-order thinking and problem-solving skills in a&#13;
subject-based curriculum, better address the heterogeneous characteristics of the secondary&#13;
education population, and assist MINEDUC fulfill its legal responsibility to implement the&#13;
LOCE Law. The development of evaluation capacity would help achieve consistency between&#13;
the intended (official) and the learned curriculum in both tracks of all the publicly financed&#13;
secondary schools.&#13;
3.5   Reformulation of Curriculum. The project would finance the: (a) establishment of a&#13;
small, well qualified Curriculum Planning and Evaluation Unit (CPEU) within MINEDUC;&#13;
(b) reformulation of the subject-based core curriculum; (c) development of 40 teaching and&#13;
learning material prototypes with the new curricular contents (curricular products including&#13;
educational videos, didactic materials, and teaching methodologies) to be procured and&#13;
disseminated to interested schools; (d) provision of technical assistance to interested secondary&#13;
schools through the TSN during the implementation of their corresponding syllabus;&#13;
(e) dissemination of curriculum innovations through bulletins, and other fora; (f) provision of&#13;
local and international technical assistance to help the CPEU carry out its functions; and&#13;
(g) study tours to observe curriculum reformulation and development of evaluation capacity in&#13;
other countries.&#13;
3.6   The CPEU would comprise a central team of six full-time senior experts in the areas of&#13;
curriculum development and evaluation. The CPEU would be assisted by about 31 curricular&#13;
specialists and 23 evaluation specialists working under short-term contracts not exceeding six&#13;
months. The CPEU would design and implement a core curriculum and corresponding syllabus&#13;
for both tracks of secondary education during the first two years of the project by: (a) analyzing&#13;
and selecting curricular areas requiring reformulation; (b) defining terms of reference to select&#13;
short-term consulting services to elaborate curricular proposals and syllabus on the selected&#13;
areas; (c) organizing expert discussions; (d) testing, validating and approving curricular&#13;
proposals; and (e) disseminating approved curricular proposals to all schools. The CPEU would&#13;
be responsible for elaborating, validating, producing, distributing, and administering external&#13;
evaluation and student certification instruments. With regard to external evaluation, the CPEU&#13;
would coordinate its activities with the Chilean Student Assessment System (SIMCE), which&#13;
currently mainly covers the primary level. The CPEU would ensure that assessment results are&#13;
analyzed, and that feedback is provided to educational policy makers and stakeholders. The&#13;
11/   JUNAEB's vulnerability criteria is a composite function measuring poverty (see&#13;
footnote 9). JUNAEB has been utilizing this criteria to target its ongoing feeding&#13;
and scholarship programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
CPEU would ensure that interested teachers effectively implement internal testing instruments for&#13;
the subjects being taught.&#13;
3.7    For those schools not willing to implement the MINEDUC's syllabus, the project would&#13;
support their own initiatives of syllabus design, following the framework of the approved core&#13;
curriculum. These schools would identify their curricular areas requiring reformulation and then&#13;
could prepare a PDE project proposal aimed at reformulating their curriculum. PDEs would&#13;
compete for available grants to finance their implementation. Selected PDEs could access the&#13;
TSN for required technical assistance. The reformulation of school syllabus would be carried&#13;
out in the context of non-residential in-service teaching training sessions, which have borne&#13;
positive results for MECE in rural areas since 1992. This in-service teacher training strategy&#13;
has been adapted to secondary education under the Pilot Program. MECE-EM would finance&#13;
the design, reproduction and distribution of 30,000 dissemination bulletins.&#13;
3.8    Development of Evaluation Capacity. The project would finance computer hardware&#13;
and software, technical assistance, training, tests printing and distribution, scholarships, and&#13;
study tours to carry out periodic external and internal-W assessment measurements as well as&#13;
general and specific certifications. External evaluations would be targeted to a sample of about&#13;
80,000 senior students (12th grade) from 200 schools in both tracks in 1998 and the year 2000.&#13;
The CPEU, in conjunction with SIMCE, would ensure that: (a) information on progress by&#13;
secondary education students towards nationally established educational goals is available to&#13;
policy makers, teachers, and parents; and (b) tests meet stringent psychometric standards of&#13;
reliability and validity so that the information can be used to identify at-risk students, schools,&#13;
and municipalities. Internal evaluations would be developed by individual schools with the&#13;
appropriate technical assistance of the CPEU and the TSN. Teachers interested in implementing&#13;
internal testing instruments for the subjects and competencies being taught would access the TSN&#13;
through the in-service teacher training. The in-service teacher training would be carried out in&#13;
conjunction with the implementation of the core curriculum and syllabus reformulation, the&#13;
provision of the learning inputs, and other related actions to be provided by the project.&#13;
3.9    The project would finance the printing of 9,600 certification sets and 2,300 certification&#13;
manuals to carry out the general certification of all 10th grade students in both tracks, as well as&#13;
the specific certification of all 12th grade students from T-VOC schools. This latter certification&#13;
would be undertaken in the workplace where students could practice their acquired skills. The&#13;
general certification process would begin in 1998 (once the LOCE has been implemented in all&#13;
the secondary schools), and the specific certification process would start in 1996.&#13;
22/    External evaluations are performed by MINEDUC at the national level to measure&#13;
core-curriculum goal achievements. The unit of measurement is the school and the&#13;
instrument is a standardized cognitive achievement test. Internal evaluations are&#13;
performed by teachers to measure student cognitive achievement in specific modules&#13;
of the core curriculum. The unit of measurement is the student and the instrument&#13;
is a test designed by the teacher.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
3.10 Alternative Curricular Activities for at-Risk Secondary Students. (US$ 13.1 million;&#13;
7.6 percent of total baseline cost). To address relevant societal issues emanating from&#13;
secondary education students, especially those at-risk of dropping out of school, and to foster a&#13;
more constructive use of student's supplementary time, the project would: (i) establish extra-&#13;
curricular alternatives in the arts, environment, sports, preventive health (specially concerning&#13;
AIDS, teenage pregnancy, and drugs), video-clubs, student leadership development, and&#13;
communication; and (ii) improve inter-school and inter-student relations through participatory&#13;
activities. This component was implemented under the Pilot Program in 124 schools in 1994,&#13;
and was modeled after an existing extra-curricular program administered by MINEDUC.&#13;
MECE-EM would expand this component to about 1,500 schools, at an average rate of about&#13;
320 per year. Interested schools would provide their facilities on Saturdays and during the entire&#13;
month of January, and would nominate two teachers, one paid by the project and the other by&#13;
the school proprietor, to monitor the implementation of these extra-curricular activities.&#13;
3.11  The project would finance the: (a) annual marginal cost of 320 teachers, and of 256&#13;
teachers during one month in the summer; (b) reproduction of about 3,000 sets of teacher&#13;
training materials; (c) implementation of 21 training events for 3,000 teachers; (d) acquisition of&#13;
nearly 27,000 sets of extra-curricular teaching materials and required equipment, especially for&#13;
the arts and sports; (e) provision of technical assistance; (f) distribution of 600,000 dissemination&#13;
bulletins; (g) implementation of national, regional, and local dissemination events; and&#13;
(h) execution of one impact evaluation study. MINEDUC would provide the necessary support&#13;
to teachers in implementing specific extra-curricular activities. Schools would be incorporated in&#13;
a demand-driven fashion, and would be entitled to remain in the program for a maximum of&#13;
three years, after which the extra-curricular activities would be financed by the school.&#13;
3.12 Linkages with the Private Productive Sector (US$ 0.7 million; 0.4 percent of total&#13;
baseline cost). Ihis component would strengthen the linkage between the private sector and&#13;
T-VOC secondary schools by: (a) providing in-service teacher training fellowships for T-VOC&#13;
teachers in a private sector working environment; (b) establishing mechanisms to foster the&#13;
participation of the private sector in the design of a core curriculum and the specifications of&#13;
skill certification of T-VOC students; and (c) implementing a dissemination campaign to inform&#13;
the private sector about the benefits of the Law 19,247 of September 15, 1993, which is geared&#13;
toward increasing private sector contributions to education.&#13;
3.13 The project would finance a two-week residential in-service teacher training fellowship&#13;
for 1,500 teachers (two teachers per interested T-VOC secondary schools) in selected private&#13;
firms attuned to the specifics of the participating school. The project would also assist&#13;
participating private firms in designing, implementing, and monitoring the in-service teacher&#13;
training which would take place in their own facilities. Participating firms would design the&#13;
training modules for groups comprising about 20 teachers from 10 T-VOC schools.&#13;
3.14 The project would finance 32 staff-months of local consultants to elaborate and validate:&#13;
(i) occupational profiles in 15 agricultural, industrial, commercial and mining professional&#13;
clusters; and (ii) a manual explaining norms and procedures for evaluating students' occupational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
proficiency after having graduated from their senior year and completed their compulsory work&#13;
periods in the firms. To this end, the project would also finance the training of the T-VOC&#13;
school supervisors and the publication of 2,300 manuals.&#13;
3.15 The project would finance the: (a) organization of eight seminars to inform school&#13;
principals and private firms about the regulations and mechanisms for using the fiscal incentives&#13;
provided by the Law 19.247; and (b) production of dissemination brochures illustrating, with&#13;
concrete examples, how to apply the incentives.&#13;
3.16 The project would encourage interested T-VOC secondary schools to prepare school-&#13;
based initiatives (PDEs) to promote the participation of private firms in the delivery of technical-&#13;
vocational education-L'.&#13;
3.17 In-service Teacher Training (US$ 3.2 million; 1.9 percent of total baseline cost). The&#13;
project would help modify teaching practices and support an improved teaching force capable of:&#13;
(a) using appropriately the newly defined subject-based core curriculum, corresponding syllabus,&#13;
and curricular products to enhance the teaching and learning of higher-order thinling and&#13;
problem-solving skills; (b) applying testing instruments to periodically monitor the progress of&#13;
individual students; (c) using effectively the instructional resources financed by the project;&#13;
(d) designing and implementing PDEs; and (e) participating in the alternative curricular activities&#13;
for at-risk secondary students.&#13;
3.18 The proposed in-service teacher training methodology was developed by MECE, and was&#13;
utilized by the Pilot Program in 124 secondary schools during 1994. This strategy departs from&#13;
the traditional, residential training programs aimed at improving general teacher subject-&#13;
knowledge, which have been proven ineffective worldwide. The proposed training is provided&#13;
in the teacher's own work environment (the school), and consists of intensive on-site, locally&#13;
initiated workshops (School Professional Groups - SPG) of interested teachers, school principals&#13;
and supervisors working on specific teaching themes selected by the participants (for example,&#13;
use of instructional resources, and use of internal evaluation instruments). Each SPG would&#13;
consist of about 15 participants. The project would finance the: (a) implementation of 20&#13;
training workshops for 150 supervisors to implement approximately 3,000 working SPGs in&#13;
1,600 schools; (b) production of training materials including 3,200 videos, 521,000 pedagogical&#13;
modules for teachers, 120,000 teacher manuals and monitoring guidelines, and 600 supervisory&#13;
guidelines; (c) monitoring of the SPGs; (d) technical assistance for the SPGs; and (e) evaluation&#13;
of the SPGs' impact.&#13;
3.19 School-based Quality Educational Development Projects (PDEs). (US$ 20.5 million;&#13;
11.9 percent of total baseline cost). In accordance with the general decentralizing principles&#13;
13/   Several development financing agencies, such as ORT, USAID, and the Ministry of&#13;
Economic Development of the German Govermment (GTZ), have manifested an&#13;
interest in supporting school-firm projects in Chile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
framing the government's sectoral objectives, and the experience of MECEP', the project&#13;
would support secondary school-based initiatives (PDEs) focused on quality improvement and&#13;
institutional development. Grants would be provided on a competitive basis to locally designed&#13;
PDEs aiming to promote increased school participation and autonomy by allowing them to&#13;
decide how, where, and when to spend additional non-personnel, non-recurrent financial&#13;
resourcesli'. Grants would be targeted to subsidized secondary schools from both tracks,&#13;
which would participate individually or in clusters of schools behind a common project theme.&#13;
Schools would be eligible to receive a grant ranging between US$2,500 and US$15,000&#13;
equivalent per school, depending on the ehrollment and the merits of the proposed PDE.&#13;
3.20 The project would finance the: (a) design and implementation of approximately 2,000&#13;
PDEs (each Bank-financed grant would fund up to 80 percent of the cost of each eligible PDE);&#13;
(b) training of supervisors responsible for assisting secondary school teachers and principals in&#13;
preparing their PDEs; (c) development of approximately 18,500 sets of training materials, 8,100&#13;
manuals, 1,600 training videos, 1,000 evaluation guidelines, 30,000 information brochures,&#13;
2,700 dissemination posters, and 4,300 applications to participate in the program;  (d)&#13;
monitoring of PDEs in execution; (e) carrying out of about 160 regional and provincial PDE&#13;
exchange workshops to inform school stakeholders of successful subprojects, and foster cross-&#13;
fertilization among teachers, school principals and students from different schools; and&#13;
(f) carrying out of a longitudinal evaluation to describe PDE's processes and measure their&#13;
impact.&#13;
3.21 This component would be implemented gradually to allow the system to obtain feedback,&#13;
learn from experience, and adjust itself by introducing appropriate changes based on close&#13;
monitoring. Accordingly, during 1995 the project would finance the preparation of the required&#13;
training and dissemination materials, as well as undertaking the first training workshops for&#13;
supervisors. During 1996, 120 PDEs would be funded on a competitive basis. The following&#13;
four years, 360, 620, 560, and 340 PDEs would be included, respectively. Interested schools&#13;
could be granted up to a maximum of two PDEs during the entire life of the project. Schools&#13;
wishing to prepare two PDEs would be encouraged to do so sequentially rather than&#13;
concurrently, at least during the first three years of project execution. The execution of PDEs&#13;
would not exceed three years. To qualify for project financing, eligible schools would enter into&#13;
an agreement with MINEDUC under terms and conditions agreed with the Bank prior to the&#13;
disbursements of Loan proceeds. Eligible PDEs would receive financing through three payments&#13;
14/   Nearly 2,000 school-based quality improvement grants have been funded by MECE&#13;
since 1992.&#13;
15/   PDEs will be reviewed and ranked by trained secondary school supervisors from a&#13;
DEPROV different to the one having jurisdiction over the school. The supervisors&#13;
will be trained by MECE-EM to rank projects based on the following criteria:&#13;
relevance in addressing quality, efficiency, and/or equity school issues; project&#13;
formulation consistency and cohesiveness; population to be benefitted; sustainability;&#13;
and replicability. Evaluation guidelines and procedures will be developed by&#13;
MECE-EM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
representing 40, 30, and 30 percent of total PDE cost, respectively. The first payment would be&#13;
made by MINEDUC to the eligible school through the corresponding SEREMI with counterpart&#13;
funding from MINEDUC at the signing of the agreement, which would then be reimbursed by&#13;
the Loan when the SEREMI has documented this expenditure. Further payments by MINEDUC&#13;
to the eligible schools, through the SEREMI, would be made when the eligible schools have&#13;
issued their statement of expenditures. Supporting expenditure documentation would be available&#13;
in the elegible school for the duration of the PDE. It is expected that through dissemination of&#13;
good subprojects, monitoring, and evaluation, generalized principles kindled by the PDEs can&#13;
become policy as the system assimilates what works.&#13;
3.22 Schools interested in establishing links with, inter-alia, private sector firms or academic&#13;
institutions, could include these objectives in their PDEs. Additionally, interested schools could&#13;
compete for technical and financial assistance to be provided by financial development agencies&#13;
interested in assisting them, such as GTZ, ORT, USAID, or any other donor agency operating&#13;
in Chile. The possible assistance to be provided by any of the above-mentioned development&#13;
agencies would be implemented outside the Bank Loan.&#13;
3.23  Provision of Educational Resources (US$ 116 million; 67.3 percent of total baseline&#13;
cost). The project would finance the provision of the following resources, which have proven&#13;
effective in raising the quality of secondary schools1-': (a) textbooks (US$20.4 million; 11.6&#13;
percent of total baseline cost); (b) school libraries (US$22.7 million; 13.2 percent of total&#13;
baseline cost); (c) teaching materials (US$7.7 million; 4.4 percent of total baseline cost);&#13;
(d) computers (US$26.2 million; 15.2 percent of total baseline cost); and (e) infrastructure&#13;
(US$39.3 million; 22.8 percent of total baseline cost). This component would aim to:&#13;
(a) improve student access to these resources in the context of new curricular and teaching&#13;
orientations; (b) guide and stimulate the national and international markets for secondary school&#13;
educational resources by sending appropriate signals about their demand and content; and&#13;
(c) establish a long-term system of acquisition, distribution, storage, effective use, and evaluation&#13;
of these resources by closely coordinating it with the curricular, teaching process, and evaluation&#13;
components of this project.&#13;
3.24 Textbooks. The project would supply textbooks to all publicly subsidized secondary&#13;
school students (nearly 590,000) in grades 9 through 12, in language, mathematics, social and&#13;
natural sciences, and technology. Textbooks would be designed to cover the material of two&#13;
consecutive grades -9th and 10th, and 11th and 12th- and to have a lifetime of two years. Each&#13;
student would receive a set comprising between three to five books, encompassing, inter-alia, the&#13;
subject matters mentioned-above. At least, one book would be allocated through the school&#13;
library at a ratio of one book per three students.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
3.25 The project would finance the purchase of about 1.5 million sets of textbooks to be&#13;
delivered directly to students, and approximately 300,000 textbooks to be allocated through&#13;
school libraries during the project's implementation. The project would acquire about 1,200,000&#13;
textbooks per year during project execution, starting in 1996. Textbook selection and&#13;
procurement would be done through a two-step process, in line with Government's procedures&#13;
(100 percent of this subcomponent is being financed with counterpart funding). The CPEU, in&#13;
conjunction with MINEDUC's existing textbook unit, would establish the specifications for the&#13;
textbooks. Textbooks and manuscripts would then be selected on the basis of quality standards,&#13;
from samples made available from national and international publishers. Second, approved texts&#13;
and manuscripts would be invited for bid, at prices based on a curve of estimated sales. A short&#13;
list (of four titles maximum) would then be approved for each subject and grade in line with the&#13;
new curricular orientation. The titles of the selected books, together with a technical&#13;
description, would be sent to the secondary schools so that teachers can choose those which best&#13;
correspond to their needs as determined by the SPGs. After the results of this consultation are&#13;
compiled, orders would be placed if a minimum of about 7,500 copies of a title have been&#13;
requested by the teachers. At the end of each school year, MINEDUC, through the SPGs,&#13;
would survey teachers' opinions on the textbooks in order to upgrade the terms of reference of&#13;
future procurement bidding documents. Teachers would be trained on textbook selection criteria&#13;
and their appropriate and creative use.&#13;
3.26 School Libraries. The project would promote the use of printed, audiovisual and&#13;
multimedia materials through the development of school libraries in all publicly funded schools.&#13;
Three different types of libraries would be established by the project: local libraries, collective&#13;
libraries and system libraries. Local libraries would serve individual schools and would consist&#13;
of either 1,200, 1,700 or 2,100 books depending on the number of students in the school and its&#13;
availability of books. Collective libraries, holding a collection of an additional 2,500 books,&#13;
would be established in 200 local libraries selected according to the following criteria:&#13;
(i) expressed desire to house the library; (ii) capacity to do so; (iii) availability of personnel to&#13;
administer the library; and (iv) location relative to other schools that would use the library.&#13;
System libraries would connect approximately 3 collective libraries with their respective local&#13;
libraries through an automated networking system that would ensure the instant availability of&#13;
information. The libraries would consists of reference materials, youth and adult collections,&#13;
contemporary literature, recreational materials, and specialized educational and curricular&#13;
materials. The implementation of this subcomponent was initiated in 1994 under the Pilot&#13;
Program in 124 secondary schools.&#13;
3.27 The project would finance: (i) 2.8 million books; (ii) cataloguing and processing&#13;
materials; (iii) technical assistance; (iv) production of printed and audiovisual training materials;&#13;
(v) training; and (vi) dissemination materials. About 30 percent of the stock for the local&#13;
libraries would be delivered during 1995 and 1996; 35 percent would be acquired in 1997 and&#13;
1998; and the remaining 35 percent would be purchased in 1999 and 2000. The collective and&#13;
system libraries would be established during the fourth year and fifth years of the project,&#13;
respectively. The first purchase of library materials would include basic titles selected by&#13;
MINEDUC with the assistance of specialists. This initial collection would be selected and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
procured in a two-step procedure (para. 3.25) in line with the Government's procedures (100&#13;
percent of this subcomponent is being financed with counterpart funding). The second and third&#13;
purchases would be selected by teachers from a pre-approved list compiled by MINEDUC.&#13;
After the results of this consultation are compiled in the PCU, orders would be placed by&#13;
MINEDUC. To replenish the libraries and ensure their sustainability, the project would inform&#13;
schools of various existing agencies and Laws (setting the fiscal basis for private contribution to&#13;
education) which could provide schools with books.&#13;
3.28 Teachers would be trained in evaluation and selection criteria for the libraries' contents,&#13;
and in the development of reading and general language skills by students through activities&#13;
which may include research and homework assignments requiring consultation or reference&#13;
library materials. The management and organization of the library would be key in ensuring the&#13;
fluid and efficient use of resources and time available to teachers. Libraries would be staffed by&#13;
current school personnel (librarians, teachers, and support staff) and parents who would receive&#13;
special training. All libraries would receive manuals (with instructions on services offered by&#13;
the library, its organization, processing of bibliographical material, lists of available library&#13;
materials, staffing requirements, and user education) and a Directory of the library network. In&#13;
cases in which school's installed infrastructure is not deemed adequate to house the library's&#13;
contents, the project's infrastructure component would provide schools with essential&#13;
infrastructure needed to house the libraries and computer multi-use rooms.&#13;
3.29 Teaching Materials. This subcomponent would: (i) increase the supply of both non-&#13;
curricular and curricular teaching materialsO' through demand and non-demand mechanisms;&#13;
(ii) establish and update, with the input of teachers and students, a Secondary Education&#13;
Teaching Materials Catalogue (SETMC) which would assist them in selecting, applying and&#13;
evaluating such materials; and (iii) orient and stimulate the national and international markets for&#13;
secondary education teaching materials by sending signals about demand through orchestrated&#13;
seminars and procurement processes. The implementation of this subcomponent was initiated in&#13;
1994 under the Pilot Program in 124 secondary schools.&#13;
3.30 The project would finance: (i) approximately 930 packages of non-curricular materials&#13;
consisting of a television, two video recorders, one slide projector, a slide projector, a stock of&#13;
video and audio cassettes, and a cassette player targeted to the neediest schools; (ii) curricular&#13;
materials such as educational software, natural science kits, and chemistry sets; (iii) manuals for&#13;
the instructional use of these materials; (iv) technical assistance to establish the specifications of&#13;
the materials to be included in the SETMC; (v) training; (vi) publications, dissemination&#13;
activities, and information workshops with suppliers of these teaching materials; and (vii) study&#13;
tours abroad to analyze the market of teaching materials of other countries.&#13;
17/   Non-curricular materials provide support for teaching and learning which offer&#13;
neither a specific pedagogical nor a methodological application. Curricular materials&#13;
seek to develop specific themes, concepts or skills in a specific context.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
3.31 During the project's first year, the CPEU would hire five specialists in language,&#13;
mathematics, natural and social sciences, and technology to provide the specifications of the&#13;
curricular materials. Selection and procurement of non-curricular materials would be done&#13;
through price bids (para. 3.25) in line with Government's procedures (100 percent of this&#13;
subcomponent is being financed with counterpart funding). Curricular materials would be&#13;
selected on the basis of their quality and conformity with the new curricular orientation, from&#13;
samples made available from local and international manufacturers. Selected teaching materials&#13;
would be included in the SETMC. The SETMC would include, besides the pre-approved&#13;
materials, an explanation of concepts and skills developed by each material; guidelines for&#13;
selection; a methodological guide for classroom application; a description of additional&#13;
equipment required; and an evaluation survey to later determine the effectiveness of the&#13;
materials. The SETMC would be sent to schools from which teachers and students would&#13;
choose materials with a pre-specified budget. After the results of this consultation are compiled&#13;
in the CPEU, orders would be placed by MINEDUC for the curriculum materials requested by&#13;
the schools. The SETMC would be updated three times during project execution.&#13;
3.32 Schools would acquire the selected material from the SETMC through a non-monetary&#13;
voucher (NMV) of US$1,500, US$1,800 or US$2,200, depending on the size of the school&#13;
(below 300 students, the school would receive NMVs of US$1,500; between 301 and 900&#13;
students, the school would receive NMVs of US$1,800; and above 901 students, the school&#13;
would receive an NMV of US$2,200). Some schools would be entitled to the basic package of&#13;
non-curricular materials during the first year of project execution. During the second and fourth&#13;
years of the project, additional materials would be allocated through the voucher system based&#13;
on the school's teaching needs. Teachers would be trained (para. 3.17) to: (i) identify&#13;
pedagogical priorities requiring teaching materials; (ii) evaluate and select curricular materials&#13;
according to their proposed cost, content, and methodology; (iii) effectively apply the materials&#13;
in the classroom; and (iv) effectively incorporate them into the up-dated curricular study plans.&#13;
3.33 Computer Network. This subcomponent will provide multimedia and information&#13;
technology and equipment to secondary schools to foster student acquisition of higher-order&#13;
thinldng and problem-solving skills. There is emerging evidence that computer software, in&#13;
conjunction with the use of simple everyday equipment and materials and teaching methods, is a&#13;
cost-effective alternative to laboratories in the teaching of scienceW8t. This subcomponent has&#13;
been designed on the basis of experience gained from the computer network established under&#13;
the MECE project in 150 rural and urban primary schools. The computer network&#13;
implementation in secondary education was initiated under the Pilot Project covering 62 schools&#13;
across the country.&#13;
3.34 The project would finance the equipment of a multimedia room in each participating&#13;
secondary school. Each multimedia room would provide computing services for classes of up to&#13;
20 students. The equipment in each room would include about 11 computers, three printers,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
multimedia accessories, and general software (word processing, data base, spreadsheets, desk-top&#13;
publishing, drawing) and more pedagogical software for students and teachers. The project&#13;
would incorporate into the network existing computers currently available in some secondary&#13;
schools. The project would finance technical assistance and training provided by higher&#13;
education institutions in the country. The project would also finance the interconnection with&#13;
other national and international communication networks. Computers would be interconnected&#13;
by telephone, occupying phone lines mostly at night when telephone rates are lower. Finally,&#13;
the project would finance the establishment of a monitoring and impact evaluation system to&#13;
measure creativity and innovation displayed by students, evolution of student's cognitive skills,&#13;
and interpersonal relations induced through the network.&#13;
3.35 All publicly financed secondary schools would be brought into the network following a&#13;
demand-driven approach based on the school's capacity to integrate its activities with other&#13;
elements of MECE-EM through the SPGs. MECE has shown that participating schools would&#13;
probably undergo a process of gradual technological assimilation, beginning with an initial&#13;
acceptance of the technology, followed by an adaptation phase and finally, the emergence of&#13;
locally designed innovations. Because this process is slow, implementation would proceed&#13;
gradually. The training to be provided, replicated from MECE, would consist of workshops to&#13;
familiarize teachers and students with the multimedia equipment, technology, and software, and&#13;
to disseminate the uses of the network in other schools.&#13;
3.36 School Infrastructure. This subcomponent aims to: (i) provide the essential infrastructure&#13;
and furniture needed to successfully implement the school libraries, the computer network&#13;
technological rooms, and the teaching methods transformation components; and (ii) improve the&#13;
image and identity of the secondary schools. Regarding essential infrastructure, the project&#13;
would finance approximately 890 infrastructure projects to: remodel libraries, computer&#13;
facilities, and teacher meeting facilities; construct new libraries and computer facilities; and&#13;
improve bathrooms, electrical installations, and roofs. The project would also finance furniture&#13;
for about 1,500 libraries, computer facilities, and teacher meeting rooms. The implementation&#13;
of this subcomponent was initiated in 1994 under the Pilot Program in 124 secondary schools.&#13;
3.37 Regarding improvement of the image and identity of secondary schools, the project would&#13;
finance the acquisition and distribution of about 1,500 flags, emblems, and signs, and school-&#13;
based refurbishing initiatives. Additionally, the project would finance technical assistance,&#13;
transportation and subsistence to supervise the implementation of this component at the national&#13;
level. The experience gained from the infrastructure remodelling, maintenance, and construction&#13;
of primary schools under MECE and the Pilot Program would be applied in this project.&#13;
3.38 Enhancing Sectoral Managerial Capacity (US$ 7.6 million; 4.4 percent of total&#13;
baseline cost). In order to address the sectoral management issues at all levels of decision&#13;
making, the project would finance the implementation of leadership and management training&#13;
programs for school principals and heads of disciplinary areas, and the establishment, updating,&#13;
and maintenance of a Technical Support Network (TSN). Additionally, the project would build&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
upon MECE's institutional strengthening activities in execution since 1992, which include the&#13;
enhancement of sectoral planning, monitoring and management capacities.&#13;
3.39 The leadership and management training programs for school principals and heads of&#13;
disciplinary areas aims to: (a) improve their capacity to manage secondary schools in a&#13;
decentralized framework; and (b) provide the necessary leadership to promote the improvement&#13;
of curricular, pedagogical, and evaluation practices in their schools. The project would finance&#13;
the provision of local and international technical assistance to develop the training workshops&#13;
and materials, and also to train approximately 1,600 school principals and 1,600 heads of&#13;
disciplinary areas in communication, leadership, strategic planning, problem solving, and&#13;
appropriate use of educational resources.&#13;
3.40 To assist interested schools with the implementation of different project components, as&#13;
well as municipalities with enhancement of management capacity, the project would finance: (i)&#13;
the creation, maintenance, and dissemination of a TSN Directory, which would be made&#13;
available to all 1,600 publicly subsidized secondary schools, as well as to the 334 municipalities;&#13;
and (ii) the design and implementation of administrative and financial mechanisms to enable&#13;
interested secondary schools use the services provided by the TSN. The TSN Directory would&#13;
be updated annually by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). Technical assistance provided by&#13;
the network members (para. 3.2 (j)) would be evaluated by the PCU based on stringent quality&#13;
control criteria. Network members which do not satisfy this criteria would be removed from the&#13;
roster. The project would finance the printing and distribution of 8,500 Directories.&#13;
3.41 MECE has allocated about US$16.4 million to: (a) acquire computers and peripheral&#13;
equipment, vehicles, office fumiture, communication and reproduction equipment tailored to the&#13;
specific needs of the central, regional, and provincial offices of MINEDUC; (b) develop training&#13;
materials and manuals needed to carry out training programs for the SEREMIS, DEPROV,&#13;
municipalities, and participating schools which aim to strengthen the skills of managers;&#13;
(c) strengthen MlNEDUC's management information system to provide timely and reliable data&#13;
for program formulation, implementation, and evaluation; and (d) support the implementation of&#13;
educational programs at all levels of decision making. MECE-EM would provide additional&#13;
resources to continue institutional strengthening activities up to the year 2000. Specifically, the&#13;
project would finance technical assistance, equipment, and studies to: (i) reinforce MINEDUC's&#13;
analytical capacity in the areas of analysis of benefits and costs of altemative policies, including&#13;
those related to tertiary education; (ii) implement strategic planning; (iii) complement the&#13;
SEREMIS, DEPROV, and the municipalities with information and communication equipment to&#13;
improve their efficiency in dealing with secondary education; (iv) enhance the Secondary&#13;
Education Academic Achievement Assessment (SIMCE-Media); and (v) improve management&#13;
capacity at all levels of decision-making.&#13;

4. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
A. Cost of the Project&#13;
4.1   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$207 million based on estimated prices as&#13;
of September 1994. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at US$37.5 million, or 18 percent&#13;
of the total cost. Costs of each component, subcomponent, and expenditure category, were&#13;
derived from detailed surveys, using schools, students, and teachers as the units of analysis.&#13;
Table 4.1 summarizes the estimated project costs by component and main intervention&#13;
categories. Detailed project costs are shown in Annex E.&#13;
4.2   Contingency Allowances. Physical contingencies amount to 15 percent of base costs for&#13;
civil works, 10 percent for textbooks and libraries, 5 percent for other educational resources and&#13;
operating costs, and 3 percent of base costs for goods and equipment for all components. No&#13;
physical contingencies were applied to consultant services. Price contingencies for foreign costs&#13;
are based on a projected international inflation rate of 2.2 percent per year for the 1995-2000&#13;
period.&#13;
4.3   Duties and Taxes. Locally procured goods are subject to a value added tax (VAT) of 18&#13;
percent. Imported goods are subject to a customs tax (11 percent) and the 18 percent VAT.&#13;
The estimated base cost of the project includes these local taxes, which amount to approximately&#13;
US$30.2 million. Local tax expenditures would be totally financed with counterpart funds.&#13;
B. Fmancing Plan&#13;
4.4   The project would be financed by a Bank loan of US$35 million, or 16.9 percent of total&#13;
project cost net of duties and taxes. It would cover 45 percent of foreign exchange expenditures&#13;
and 13 percent of the estimated local costs. The government of Chile would finance the&#13;
remaining US$172 million, including duties and taxes. Table 4.2 shows the project financing&#13;
plan, with a breakdown by project categories, while Annex E, Table E-5 shows the project&#13;
yearly financing by source and category of expenditure.&#13;
C. Education Sector Budget for FY95&#13;
4.5   The Chilean government will have the capability to sustain the project financially, given&#13;
the increases in public financing of the education sector expected to result from the high priority&#13;
assigned to the sector by the current administration. One illustration of the sector's importance&#13;
is the FY95 Budget Law submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the Congress, which provides&#13;

US$1.41 billion for the Ministry of Education (Annex F, Table F-1). This budget reflects a 5.8&#13;
percent real increase in education spending compared with the FY94 budget. The government&#13;
recognizes that sector recurrent spending cannot grow more than proportionately to the overall growth&#13;
of public revenues and spending. Furthermore, under a framework of budgetary constraints,&#13;
spending within the sector has to be carefully targeted to accomplish its quality and equity objectives.&#13;
The project, with its emphasis on improving quality, external and internal efficiency, and equity&#13;
through targeting of schools in low-income communities, is fully consistent with sectoral&#13;

spending targets. Moreover, the project would take place within a context of fiscal surpluses which is&#13;
favorable to spending in the social sector, especially in education.&#13;
D. Recurrent Costs Arising from the Project&#13;
4.6    The project has a high content of expenditures on educational resources (textbooks, school&#13;
libraries, teaching materials, and computers) which represent 44.5 percent of total baseline cost, and&#13;
on infrastructure, representing another 22.8 percent of total baseline cost. The only incremental&#13;
recurrent cost introduced by the project is salariesl2', which represent less than 0.4 percent of total&#13;
project cost. These salaries (excluding those for the PCU personnel) would be 100 percent financed&#13;
with counterpart funding throughout the execution of the project.&#13;
4.7    The Bank loan would finance (Table 4.2): (a) 99 percent of computer equipment expenditures;&#13;
(b) 89 percent of the PCU expenditures; and (c) 66 percent of the school-based quality development&#13;
subprojects (PDEs) expenditures. The Borrower would finance (Table 4.2): (a) 100 percent of taxes,&#13;
civil works, textbooks and manuals, libraries and teaching aids, consultant services, salaries, furniture&#13;
12/ Salaries for PCU personnel is not a recurrent cost as the PCU is dissolved at project&#13;
completion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
and equipment, transportation and per diem, and operating costs; (b) 34 percent of the PDEs&#13;
expenditures; (c) 12 percent of the PCU expenditures; and (d) one percent of computer equipment&#13;
expenditures. The bulk of the project costs financed by the Govemment would occur during the&#13;
1996-1998 period, representing an average of US$43 million per year (Annex E, Table E-5), or about&#13;
2.7 percent of the expected sector budget for 1997 (Annex F, Table F-1).&#13;
E. Project Sustainability&#13;
4.8   The effect of the project on total sector costs and the ability of the government to sustain the&#13;
expenditures that will result from project implementation are important questions. Annex F, Table F-&#13;
1, derived from a recent study commissioned by the Bank (Riveros, 1994, reference C. 16), shows&#13;
actual and projected recurrent spending for education that would result from the project for the period&#13;
2001 through 2010, estimated at US$9.4 million per year, under an education sector budget growth&#13;
assumption of 5.8 percent per annum. From the point of view of sustainability, these data show that&#13;
additional recurrent expenditures would represent on the average 0.5 percent of the estimated sector&#13;
budget projected for the year, equivalent to 3.0 percent of MINEDUC's forecast secondary education&#13;
budget. This increase is affordable by the Borrower, especially considering that the Government has&#13;
assigned the highest priority to this sector.&#13;
S. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Status of Preparation&#13;
5.1   Project preparation was financed by the Government with resources from MECE's secondary&#13;
assessment component. Each project component and subcomponent presented to the Bank is&#13;
consistent with the Government's sector policies, objectives, and strategies. Moreover, since the&#13;
project preparation coordinator reports directly, and on an ongoing basis, to the Minister and&#13;
Undersecretary of Education, the project enjoys substantial support. The counterpart funds required&#13;
by MECE-EM for 1995, amounting to US$13.4 million, have been approved by the Congress in the&#13;
FY95 Budget Law.&#13;
B. Inplementation Schedule&#13;
5.2   The project is expected to be implemented over a six-year period, from January 1995 to&#13;
December 2000. The completion date would be December 31, 2000 and the closing date would be&#13;
June 30, 2001. Project activities started after appraisal (January 10, 1995), would be recognized by&#13;
the Bank as part of the Government's counterpart funding. The yearly physical targets and&#13;
implementation schedule are shown in Annex G, Tables G-1 and G-2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
C. Project Management&#13;
5.3   Project execution would be coordinated by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), herein referred&#13;
to as MECE-EM PCU. A National Coordinator would be in charge of the PCU, and assited by a&#13;
Secondary Education Project Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator. The MECE-EM PCU reports to&#13;
the Minister and Undersecretary of Education through the National Coordinator, which also is in&#13;
charge of managing the Bank-financed Primary Education (MECE) Project. The MECE-EM PCU&#13;
would assist MINEDUC in overseeing the project's implementation and general coordination, and&#13;
ensuring that the project's execution is carried out according to established guidelines, procedures,&#13;
and agreed targets. The MECE-EM PCU consists of a small matrix-type managerial organization&#13;
with six program units (reformulation of curriculum and development of evaluation capacity;&#13;
alternative curricular activities for socially and educationally at-risk students; in-service teacher&#13;
training; school-based quality development projects; educational resources; and infrastructure) and&#13;
four support units (project planning, programming and monitoring; procurement, technical assistance,&#13;
and personnel; budgeting, financing, disbursement, accounting, and auditing; and legal affairs) as&#13;
shown in Annex H. No new support units would be established for this project. Instead, the project&#13;
would utilize MECE's four existing support units. The program units would coordinate and monitor&#13;
the implementation of their respective project components through MINEDUC's central, regional, and&#13;
provincial structures.&#13;
5.4   The PCU National Coordinator would be assisted by an Ad-Hoc Overseeing Committee&#13;
presided by the Minister of Education and comprised by the Undersecretary of Education, the&#13;
Director General of MINEDUC's Education Division, the Director of MINEDUC's Planning and&#13;
Programming Division, and the Director of the Teacher Training and Educational Research Center&#13;
(CPEIP). The Ad-Hoc Oversight Committee would meet about every three months to review project&#13;
implementation, address policy, strategy, and organizational problems that could affect project&#13;
execution, and review project monitoring indicators.&#13;
5.5   During project implementation, the PCU would employ 12 senior level professional&#13;
consultants, eight technical staff, and up to eight support staff. During negotiations, the Bank&#13;
obtained the Borrower's agreement that a PCU, under terms of reference satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank, would be established and staffed as a condition of Loan effectiveness, and that prior&#13;
review by the Bank would be required for the appointments of the PCU's National Coordinator,&#13;
and the MECE-EM PCU's Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator. Annex H describes in more&#13;
detail the functions and responsibilities of each MECE-EM PCU unit. During negotiations, the&#13;
Bank obtained the Borrower's agreement that the adoption of MECE-EM's Operational Manual&#13;
by MNEEDUC, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of Loan effectiveness.&#13;
5.6   As a condition for disbursement of PDE's subprojects, selected schools would enter into an&#13;
agreement (already agreed with the Bank) with MINEDUC through the SEREMIs. Such an&#13;
agreement would be a prerequisite to Bank financing of any such subproject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
5.7   The categories of expenditures subject to Bank financing, under the project, are: (a) computer&#13;
equipment; (b) school-based quality development subprojects (PDEs); and (c) PCU personnel. All&#13;
other expenditure categories would be financed entirely with counterpart funding throughout the&#13;
project implementation period.&#13;
5.8   Procurement methods would require documents and procedures as follows:&#13;
(a)   International competitive bidding (ICB) would be carried following Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines, and would require the use of Bank issued standard bidding documents,&#13;
which are mandatory. Under ICB, domestic preference may be applied, in accordance&#13;
with Bank guidelines for the procurement of goods. During negotiations, the&#13;
Borrower agreed that standard ICB bidding documents for the acquisition of&#13;
computer equipment, acceptable to the Bank, adopted by MINEDUC be made a&#13;
condition for Loan effectiveness;&#13;
(b)   Local competitive bidding (LCB) would be carried out under procedures to be agreed&#13;
with the Bank using approved standard bidding documents. During negotiations, the&#13;
Borrower agreed that standard LCB bidding documents, acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
adopted by M DUC would be a condition for Loan effectiveness;&#13;
(c)   Local and international shopping would be carried out according to procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank which will require a minimum of three price quotations obtained&#13;
from eligible suppliers; and&#13;
(d)   Selection and appointment of consultants for the PCU would be done in accordance&#13;
with World Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981).&#13;
5.9   Table 5.1 summarizes procurement under the Bank loan. In addition to the requirements&#13;
described in para. 5.8, procurement of categories subject to Bank financing would comply with the&#13;
following procedures:&#13;
a)    Computer equipment (computers, peripheral equipment, and computer software)&#13;
would be procured on the basis of: (i) ICB procedures for packages of US$350,000&#13;
equivalent, or more; (ii) LCB procedures for packages valued above US$100,000 and&#13;
below US$350,000 equivalent; and (iii) local or international shopping for packages&#13;
valued at US$100,000 equivalent or less. Aggregate totals to be procured under these&#13;
methods are: US$20.2 million, US$1.8 million, and US$0.8 million, respectively;&#13;
b)    PDE funds to be allocated to eligible schools would range from a minimum of&#13;
US$2,500 to a maximum of US$15,000 per school per PDE. Procurement may&#13;
include goods (paper, utensils, and materials), technical assistance, and services&#13;
&#13;

(transportation, rental of conference rooms, meetings, etc.). Given the nature of the&#13;
PDEs, procurement of goods, with an aggregate total of about US$24.1 million, would&#13;
be done preferably through local shopping. Direct contracting may apply when price&#13;
quotations cannot be obtained up to an overall aggregate amount of US$8.0 million&#13;
&#13;

para. 5.8(d); and&#13;
d)    Civil works; textbooks and manuals; libraries and teaching materials; consultant&#13;
services (other than PCU personnel); salaries; furniture and equipment;&#13;
transportation and per-diems; operating costs; and taxes would be financed entirely&#13;
from counterpart funds.&#13;
5.10 Prior Review. Prior review by the Bank would be required for all documentation concerning&#13;
the: (i) ICB procurement of computer equipment; (ii) procurement of computer equipment for the first&#13;
LCB contract awarded each year of project implementation; and (iii) terms of reference of all the&#13;
higher-level positions in the PCU (Annex H) and the qualifications and employment conditions for the&#13;
PCU National Coordinator, and the MECE-EM PCU Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator. All other&#13;
documentation for contracts related to categories subject to Bank financing would be reviewed by&#13;
sampling on an ex-post basis during Bank supervision missions. If it were determined that&#13;
procurement was not made in accordance with agreed procedures, then no expenditures for such items&#13;
would be financed with proceeds from the Loan and the Special Account would have to be reimbursed&#13;
accordingly by the Borrower. The proposed review procedures would cover about 46 percent of the&#13;
total value of Bank financed contracts and expenditures under the project. This percentage may&#13;
appear to be low, but the Bank is financing only 17 percent of total project cost, and as explained in&#13;
para. 5.9(b), procurement related to the PDEs totalling US$24.1 million would not be subject to prior&#13;
review procedures. However, ex-post review of the PDE grant-fund award process would be&#13;
conducted during project supervision, on a sample basis, covering not less than five percent of the&#13;
PDEs implemented. MECE's three years of experience in carrying out procurement procedures&#13;
under Bank guidelines, and the fact that MECE-EM's procurement will be carried out by the same&#13;
MECE team, would facilitate effective procurement operations.&#13;
E. Disbursement and Accounts&#13;
5.11  The proceeds of the Loan are expected to be disbursed in accordance with the schedule shown&#13;
in Annex I, Table I-1 over a period of six years, which is about the average country profile for Chile&#13;
(5.5 years), but shorter than the profile for the LAC region (7 years). The disbursement period was&#13;
determined after taking into account the advanced status of project design, MINEDUC's execution&#13;
capacity, and the yearly budget amounts approved by the Ministry of Finance. The allocation and&#13;
disbursement of the Bank loan are summarized in Table 5.2.0&#13;
20/ This loan disbursement arrangement, tailored to the expected pace of project&#13;
execution, conforms to the recently amended Operational Directive (OD) 12.00,&#13;

5.12 Disbursements would be made against certified Statements of Expenditures (SOE) for:&#13;
(a) computer equipment contracts below US$350,000 except for the first LCB computer equipment&#13;
contract each year; (b) each PDE subproject, under such terms and conditions as the Bank shall&#13;
specify by notice to the Borrower; and (c) higher-level personnel in the PCU (Annex H) estimated to&#13;
cost US$50,000 equivalent or less, except the PCU manager, the MECE-EM's coordinator and&#13;
deputy coordinator. Disbursements for contracts requiring prior review would be fully documented.&#13;
Relevant documentation in support of SOEs and of consultant contracts not subject to prior review&#13;
would not be submitted to the Bank, but would be retained by the PCU and made available to the&#13;
Bank during supervision missions.&#13;
5.13 Special Account. The Borrower would establish a Special Account in the Central Bank of&#13;
Chile, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The Special Account would be&#13;
denominated in US dollars and would be established with an authorized allocation of US$2.2 million&#13;
(the estimated four-month disbursement requirement for the expenditure categories) after loan&#13;
effectiveness. The initial deposit of up to US$1.5 million will be made, and the full amount of the&#13;
authorized allocation will be released when disbursements reach a level of US$6 million equivalent.&#13;
Withdrawals from the Special Account would be made by MINEDUC as needed and the Account&#13;
would be replenished by the Bank periodically at the request of MINEDUC on the basis of standard&#13;
disbursement procedures. Project expenditures would be monitored by the PCU on behalf of&#13;
MINEDUC. Records of the Special Account deposits would be available for review by Bank&#13;
supervision missions, and would be audited annually by an independent auditor satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
F. Audits&#13;
5.14 The Bank would require that an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank: (a) audit all&#13;
accounts, SOEs, and Special Accounts; (b) apply auditing standards and procedures satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank and conforming to generally accepted auditing practices; (c) carry out its auditing work in a&#13;
timely manner so that an annual report would be presented no later than six months after the end of&#13;
each fiscal year; and (d) render an audit opinion or the reasons why such an opinion cannot be&#13;
rendered. Given the expected geographical dispersion of PDEs under execution, the Bank would&#13;
require that basic elements of conventional financial management, accounting and auditing be included&#13;
specifically for the PDE project component in the auditing procedures of the project, and that the&#13;
procurement process of between 5 to 10 percent of the PDEs in execution be audited on annual basis.&#13;
G. Project Monitoring, Evaluation and Supervision&#13;
5.15 Key efficiency, quality, and equity indicators (Annex J, Table J-1) would be monitored to&#13;
track improvements in the overall effectiveness of secondary education. To support spot-checking of&#13;
any of the project's subcomponents, a target matrix has been prepared ( Annex G, Table G-1).&#13;
During negotiations, the Borrower agreed that a rmal version of monitoring indicators&#13;
concerning equity improvements between socially and educationally high, medium, and low risk&#13;
secondary education students, satisfactory to the Bank, would be included in the Operational&#13;
Manual (paras 5.5 and 7.2(b)).&#13;
5.16 Overall monitoring and evaluation of the project would be the responsibility of the PCU.&#13;
Specific tasks include: (a) preparing annual progress reports on project implementation, which would&#13;
be submitted to the Bank by June 30 of each year starting in 1996; (b) measuring quantitative and&#13;
qualitative objectives achieved against the monitoring indicators shown in the implementation matrix;&#13;
(c) annually updating project implementation schedules and action plans; (d) selecting consultants to&#13;
carry out the impact evaluation studies included in the components of MECE-EM; and (e) preparing a&#13;
Project Completion Report that would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the&#13;
closing date of the Loan (on or about December 31, 2001). Annex J, Table J-2 delineates the Bank's&#13;
supervision plan, including: (i) frequency of missions; (ii) skill mix needed in each supervision&#13;
mission; (iii) project launch seminar; (iv) mid-term review; (v) regular Bank and specific supervision&#13;
schedules; and (vi) local and international consultants. Supervision arrangements are expected to&#13;
require a total of about 53 staffweeks during project execution. Given the good experience under the&#13;
previous Bank-financed project (MECE), this project would require less supervision resources from&#13;
the Bank and, instead, rely more on the Govemment's close supervision in the field.&#13;
5.17 Mid-Term Review. A project Mid-Term Review would be held in the thirtieth month after&#13;
the date of project effectiveness. The Mid-Term Review would focus on project implementation,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
management, and impact on the project's objectives concerning the enhancement of secondary&#13;
education: (a) external and internal efficiency; (b) quality; (c) equity; (d) strengthening of institutional&#13;
management; and (e) institutionalization of MECE-EM within the MINEDUC existing structure. The&#13;
Mid-Term Review would also include the lessons learned during project implementation to be&#13;
incorporated into a Government's action plan for structural reform (para. 2.49). During&#13;
negotiations, the Borrower: (i) confirmed the date, scope and content of the Mid-Term Review&#13;
agreed with the Bank during appraisal; and (ii) agreed that the Mid-Term Review performance&#13;
and impact indicators would be included in the Operational Manual (see paras. 5.5, 7.1(b),&#13;
7.2(b), and Annex J, Table J-3).&#13;
6. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Expected Benefits&#13;
6.1   The project would lead to cost savings and efficiency gains as a result of reducing the number&#13;
of secondary education students repeating grades and/or dropping out of school. Similarly, the&#13;
project would generate economic benefits accruing to students who do not repeat or become dropouts&#13;
as a result of the project, and whose labor market performance would improve. Other benefits&#13;
include: (a) increased productivity stemming from a more educated and trainable labor force with&#13;
higher-order thinking and problem-solving skills; (b) increased social mobility, especialy for low-&#13;
income secondary education students; and (c) reduced social inequality stemming from targeted&#13;
project interventions. Finally, the project would further strengthen managerial capacity in the&#13;
MINEDUC, municipalities, and secondary schools.&#13;
B. Expected Risks&#13;
6.2   The major risks associated with project implementation are: (a) possible distortions in targeting&#13;
project interventions; (b) possible difficulties by some secondary schools, especiaUy those serving&#13;
socially and educationally at-risk students, in integrating the different lines of action of the project;&#13;
and (c) possible development of non-practical learning materials prototypes (with new curricular&#13;
content) by the project that would not easily be used by the teachers. These risks would be&#13;
minimized by: (a) defining precise targeting criteria to benefit schools located in poor urban and rural&#13;
areas; (b) the gradual implementation of project components through a school demand-driven&#13;
approach, and by scheduling time for learning by doing; and (c) soliciting from the TSN learning&#13;
material prototypes (with new curricular content), including concrete and simple teaching examples&#13;
which highlight the competencies they intend to promote.&#13;

7.1   During negotiations, the Borrower confirmed:&#13;
(a)   the date, scope and content of the Mid-Term Review agreed during the appraisal&#13;
mission (para. 5.17);&#13;
(b)   that the project's performance and impact indicators would be included in the&#13;
Operational Manual (paras. 5.5 and 5.17); and&#13;
(c)   that an annual progress report on project implementation would be submitted to the&#13;
Bank for its review not later than June 30 of each year, starting in 1996.&#13;
7.2   For Loan effectiveness, the Bank would require that:&#13;
(a)   a PCU, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, be established and staffed by&#13;
MINEDUC under qualifications agreed with the Bank (paras. 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, and 5.10);&#13;
(b)   an Operational Manual of MECE-EM, satisfactory to the Bank, be adopted by&#13;
MINEDUC (para. 5.5);&#13;
(c)   standard bidding documents, acceptable to the Bank, for the ICB and LCB procurement&#13;
of computer equipment be adopted by MINEDUC (paras. 5.8(a) and (b));&#13;
(d)   FY96 counterpart funding for MECE-EM be submitted to Congress for its approval&#13;
(paras. 2.54 and 4.4); and&#13;
(e)   a legal opinion on behalf of the Borrower, satisfactory to the Bank, by a counsel&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, with respect to the validity and execution of the Loan&#13;
Agreement, be furnished to the Bank.&#13;
7.3   As a condition for disbursement of PDE subprojects, selected schools would enter into an&#13;
agreement with MINEDUC, satisfactory to the Bank, through the SEREMIs. Such an agreement&#13;
would be a prerequisite to Bank financing of any subproject.&#13;
B. Recommendation&#13;
7.4   Subject to the above assurance and conditions, the project would constitute a suitable basis for&#13;
a Bank loan of US$35 million equivalent for the Republic of Chile, repayable in 15 years, including&#13;
five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.&#13;

CHILE - PROJECT COORDINATION UNIT (PCU)&#13;
A. Objectives and Structure of the PCU&#13;
1.   Project execution would be coordinated by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), herein&#13;
referred to as MECE-EM PCU. A National Coordinator would be in charge of the PCU, and&#13;
assisted by a Secondary Education Project Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator. The MECE-EM&#13;
PCU reports to the Minister and Undersecretary of Education through the National Coordinator,&#13;
which also is in charge of managing the Bank-financed Primary Education (MECE) Project. The&#13;
MECE-EM PCU would assist MINEDUC in overseeing the project's implementation and general&#13;
coordination, and ensure that the project's execution is carried out according to established&#13;
guidelines, procedures, and agreed targets.&#13;
2.   The MECE-EM PCU would consist of a small matrix-type managerial organization2L"&#13;
with six program units (reformulation of curriculum and development of evaluation capacity;&#13;
altemative curricular activities for socially and educationally at-risk students; in-service teacher&#13;
training; school-based quality development projects; educational resources; and infrastructure) and&#13;
four support units as shown in Chart H-1. No support units would be established for this project.&#13;
Instead, the proposed project would utilize MECE's four existing support units which comprise&#13;
the following areas: (i) project planning, programming and monitoring; (ii) procurement,&#13;
technical assistance, and personnel; (iii) budgeting, financing, disbursement, accounting, and&#13;
auditing; and (iv) legal affairs. These support units would be strengthened to meet the demands&#13;
concerming the execution of both MECE and MECE-EM. The program units of MECE-EM&#13;
would coordinate and monitor the implementation of their respective project components through&#13;
MINEDUC's central, regional, and provincial structures.&#13;
3.   The heads of the six program units would report directly to the MECE-EM Coordinator&#13;
(through the Deputy Coordinator), who in turn would report to the PCU National Coordinator&#13;
(the same person managing the MECE project). Following the structure established by MECE,&#13;
the four support units would also report directly to the PCU National Coordinator. The PCU&#13;
National Coordinator would be assisted by an Ad-Hoc Overseeing Committee presided by the&#13;
Minister of Education and comprised by the Undersecretary of Education, the Director General of&#13;
MINEDUC's Education Division, the Director of MINEDUC's Planning and Programming&#13;
Division, and the Director of the CPEIP. The Ad-Hoc Overseeing Committee would meet about&#13;
every three months to review project implementation, address policy, strategy, and organizational&#13;
problems that could affect project execution, and review project monitoring indicators.&#13;
___/ In matrix organiztion theory, a program unit is responsible for aaining the&#13;
organization's objectives (ends), whereas a support unit is responsible for providing the&#13;
services (means) necessary to accomplish the organization's goals. The performance&#13;
of the programmatic units measures the effectiveness of the organization (attainment of&#13;
goals), whereas the performance of the supportive units measures the effciency of the&#13;
organizaion (resource consumption).&#13;

A. Project Performance Indicators'&#13;
The key project performance indicators, to be incorporated in the Operational Manual,&#13;
are listed below. With regard to this table, it is important to note that in the education sector it is&#13;
unrealistic to set hard and fast targets on quality, equity, and efficiency for the short and medium&#13;
term. This is largely due to the slow and sometimes unpredictable response of the education&#13;
system to change, and to the fact that changes in the educational sector are also dependent on&#13;
vanables outside the control of the proposed project. It is nevertheless advisable to monitor the&#13;
change of the indicators mentioned below over time, expecting improvements when compared&#13;
with the base information.&#13;

1    During negotiations, the Government: (i) confrmed the following scope and&#13;
content of the Mid-Term Review agreed during the appraisal mission; and (ii) agreed&#13;
that the Mid-Term Review performance and impact indicators explained below be&#13;
included in the Operational Manual (paras. 5.5, 7. 1(b), and 7.2(b)).&#13;
2.   The Mid-Term Review would be used as an occasion to assess: (i) the impact of the&#13;
project on internal efficiency, quality, and equity, with a special focus on the Key Project&#13;
Performance Indicators (Annex J, Table J-1); (ii) completion of the Yearly Project Physical&#13;
Targets (Annex G, Table G-1); (iii) the project's coordination, especially in the area of&#13;
disbursements, procurement, and annual audits; (iv) progress of the action plan to&#13;
institutionalize the coordination of the day-to-day activities of MECE-EM within&#13;
MINEDUC's existing structure; and (v) fulfillment of the loan covenants. In addition, the&#13;
Mid-Term Review would also include the lessons learned during project implementation to be&#13;
incorporated into a Government's action plan for structural reform (para. 2.49).&#13;

            Chile - Secondary Education Quality
            Improvement Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Secondary Education Quality
            Improvement Project seeks to improve the internal and
            external efficiency, quality, and equity of all the
            municipal and government-subsidized private secondary
            schools, and to strengthen sectoral managerial capacity. The
            project will improve external efficiency by: 1) establishing
            a curriculum planning and evaluation unit to reformulate the
            subject-based curriculum, for both the scientific-humanistic
            and technical-vocational secondary schools; 2) developing
            evaluation capacity to monitor the consistency between the
            recommended and the learned curriculum; 3) establishing
            alternative curricular activities for socially and
            educationally at-risk secondary students; 4) providing
            incentives to strengthen the linkages between targeted
            technical-vocational schools and the private sector in
            curriculum development, skill certification, in-service
            teacher training, and the use of physical facilities. The
            project will improve quality, equity, and internal
            efficiency by: 1) providing in-service teacher training to
            change the predominantly one-dimensional teaching format
            based mainly on rote learning and dictation, to more
            interactive methods; 2) establishing a fund to promote the
            design and implementation of school-based educational
            development projects; and 3) providing educational resources
            in a targeted manner. Finally, the project will also include
            components to strengthen sectoral managerial capacity.
