&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&#13;
LEWIS: . . . interested in what you think we really should do in this exercise. It is&#13;
formidable in the sense that there is--we have access to such a vast amount of material.&#13;
We have to be very, very selective and decide what we're going to use, principles of&#13;
selection, and weâ&#128;&#153;re still struggling with that, weâ&#128;&#153;re trying to find a story line and at the&#13;
same time sort out a set of themes, sectoral or other themes, that we will try to examine in&#13;
some depth. As you know, [Edward S.] Mason-[Robert E.] Asher had that kind of an&#13;
organization.&#13;
&#13;
And you've been around this establishment a long time, and so I think just a sort of&#13;
general conversation is what we're after at this point. When did you start in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Well, in the Bank proper I started in 1970, beginning of 1970, January 5,&#13;
1970, but I was in the IMF [International Monetary Fund] before that. I joined the IMF&#13;
on February 5, 1958, so I have been in these institutions for a pretty long time--almost 32&#13;
and a half years [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You had been a civil servant in Pakistan before that?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Not for very long, surely.&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: About five years. So, you know, that's a pretty extended career. I'm also&#13;
perhaps one of the very few people--I don't know of anyone else--who has served in&#13;
literally all parts of the Bretton Woods institutions. I served in the Fund, served in IFC&#13;
[International Finance Corporation] , and then of course in IDA [International&#13;
Development Association] , and I don't think there are too many people who haveâ&#128;&#148;I&#13;
mean, there may be a case here or there where someone has been in all institutions--but,&#13;
you know, I have had the distinction of being in these institutions for an extended period&#13;
and it has been, all in all, an extremely satisfying period for me and one that gives me a&#13;
great measure of personal pleasure.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I did not remember that you had been at the Fund. Does that give you any&#13;
particular perspectives on relations between the two institutions? Have you seen those&#13;
evolving in important ways in recent years?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Very much so. I think I considered myself very much of a Fund person at&#13;
the time that I transferred to the Bank, to IFC. And I had quite a tussle with the Fund&#13;
management, with Pierre-Paul Schweitzer at that time, in terms of my transferring to IFC,&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                             3&#13;

&#13;
but I thinkâ&#128;&#148;but it certainly has given me a perspective of the changing relationship&#13;
between the two institutions and the changing approaches of the two institutions to their&#13;
work and to the outside world. And in some ways this is a very simplistic way of putting&#13;
it, but I think increasingly over the period Lord Keynes' maxim has been proved in&#13;
reality, at least partially proved in reality, you know, that he thought of the Bank as the&#13;
Fund and the Fund as the Bank. And the Fund has increasingly become more like the&#13;
Bank over the period, and the Bank has increasingly taken on some of the functions and&#13;
approaches of the Fund over this long period of time, so that looking like, with the benefit&#13;
of hindsight, one could almost ask the question as to whether it may not have been a more&#13;
sensible thing to have one institution right at the very beginning. I still think it probably&#13;
is right the way it came out, but nonetheless I think it's a more debatable issue today,&#13;
looking at what the Bank does and what the Fund does, as to how they have in a sense&#13;
taken over each other's functions and activities to a certain degree.&#13;
&#13;
You see, let me make that a little bit more concrete in the sense that the Fund has always&#13;
been an institution that jumps into a crisis situation, and it jumps into a crisis situation in&#13;
terms of providing balance of payments support. It was also seen as a very short-term&#13;
crisis-support institution by the founders. You look at the original Articles of Agreement&#13;
of the Fund. They aimed at the balance of payments support being repaid over a three- to&#13;
five-year period, and this was to be done with essentially concessionary resources in the&#13;
early period. By contrast the Bank was seen to be a long-term institution and clearly not&#13;
a crisis institution. It was seen as an institution that would provide support for long-term&#13;
projects and programs and it would not look at its results in a short- or medium-term&#13;
context when Bank programs involved long-term measures as well. What has happened&#13;
on the other hand is that the Bank is now very much involved in crisis situations. In a&#13;
sense the Bank has recognized that you cannot plan for the long term without to some&#13;
extent taking care of crisis situations and so it does provide balance of payments support&#13;
to a significant extent today, and many countries have seen the stabilization function as a&#13;
very important threshold to moving towards a longer-term program of structural&#13;
adjustment. And it joins with the Fund in providing that type of balance of payments&#13;
support through its program lending, and through its adjustment lending program, which&#13;
was very much the function of the Fund before. By contrast the Fund now does provide&#13;
medium-term lending. Theyâ&#128;&#153;ve even included some concessionary assistance which is&#13;
provided for longer periods of time, the so-called SAF (Structural Adjustment Facility)&#13;
and ESAF (Extended Structural Adjustment Facility) and so on and so forth, and it is&#13;
beginning to worry about the supply response. It is beginning to worry about issues like&#13;
the environment, and issues such as structural adjustment are now very favored phrases at&#13;
the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
I was a little amusedâ&#128;&#148;if you look at the Berlin meeting and look at the speech of Mr.&#13;
[Michel] Camdessus at the Berlin meeting, annual meeting of the Fund and the Bank, you&#13;
will notice that he never used in his entire speech the word "stabilization" even once. But&#13;
he used the word "development" many times. Okay? If you look at the previous&#13;
speeches, say of my mentor, Per Jacobsson, who was the head of the Fund, and after him&#13;
Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, I mean their speeches are replete with issues of stabilization, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Moeen Qureshi&#13;
                              April 5, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the word "stabilization" came up in almost every paragraph. So in that sense, I mean,&#13;
you know, both institutions have had a bit of a reorientation.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So I take it that in terms of the future relations of the institutions that there is a&#13;
sort of debate, I guess, as to whether they should continue to sort of overlap and merge or&#13;
whether there should be an effort to have a clean redrawing of the division of labor&#13;
between the two of them. You would sort of incline toward the first, either as more likely&#13;
or, I mean, more appropriate?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: I think--not only do I think the first one is the more appropriate relationship,&#13;
to my mind itâ&#128;&#153;s the only practical relationship. I think redrawing in any precise fashion is&#13;
just totally an impractical idea by people do not know the institutions, they do not know&#13;
the nature of the economic problem that confronts these two institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Trying to resolve a country's economic crisis is not an issue of resolving some problems&#13;
partially. You are not going to resolve the crisis that--take the debt situation, for&#13;
example, in South America or in some other countries which are heavily indebted. The&#13;
debt problem in a sense is the tip of an iceberg, the iceberg being a whole range of&#13;
economic policies and economic management issues that have accumulated over a long&#13;
period of time which resulted in a crisis that was precipitated by the debt problem. But&#13;
beneath the debt problem are real fundamental economic management issues, economic&#13;
management issues which have to do with the degree of financial discipline that was&#13;
exercised and the way in which resources were allocated and utilized, the role of the&#13;
public sector vis-Ã -vis the private sector, the excessive, in fact, reliance on the public&#13;
sector, et cetera, that resulted in waste and inefficiency that came about in many&#13;
countries. So in that sense merely going ahead and trying to eke out the short-term&#13;
balance of payments equilibrium, even if it could be achieved, is not going to be&#13;
sustainable. Similarly, if you were to merely think in terms of trying to resolve the&#13;
longer-term issues of where is this economy going to be ten years from now, youâ&#128;&#153;re not&#13;
going to be able to do it because the inflationary environment that you're dealing with&#13;
doesn't allow for any rational decisions to be made. It doesn't allow for rational&#13;
economic projects to take place.&#13;
&#13;
So for all of those reasons to my mind if one were to say, "You stick, Fund, very clearly&#13;
to this, this, this, this, and don't do it in the context of this, that and the other which is in&#13;
the Bank's role" is going to make the Fund totally impotent and vice versa. The same&#13;
thing is true of the Bank. So just in terms of doing the job effectively, we have to&#13;
recognize that even though we may give primacy to the other institution, let's say in terms&#13;
of exchange rates where the Fund has very clear jurisdictional role established by its&#13;
Articles of Agreement, nevertheless I really cannot program a particular activity or a&#13;
particular loan in a country unless I know that the policy that is going to be followed is&#13;
one that is consistent with what I regard as a sensible approach to its economic&#13;
management. Hence the initial comment.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, let me try a counter argument on you which would be, I guess, that&#13;
there's a cultural difference between the two institutions, that the Fund is much more&#13;
&#13;
                                    Moeen Qureshi&#13;
                              April 5, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
homogeneous, that it indoctrinates people to be sort of interchangeable parts, it's tighter,&#13;
it's smaller, and it's effective as a--the world needs kind of a tough cop that will go in and&#13;
straighten out, lay down the law to people about stabilization problems, but the Bank as a&#13;
development institution is more pluralistic intellectually and less adversarial, should be,&#13;
in its approach to clients. Is there anything to that?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: I think that the earlier part of what you said is absolutely correct. There is a&#13;
lot of cultural difference. I think the conclusion you drew from that I would not go along&#13;
with, that is to say that as a consequence of this therefore the Bank should be less&#13;
adversarial. Firstly, the cultural difference is precisely what you have indicated, plus a&#13;
few other things which are very important. The homogeneity of the Fund derives&#13;
essentially from three components, first, from the fact that most people in the Fund are&#13;
economists and so that, by its very nature, brings about a much more homogeneous&#13;
culture. The second reason for the homogeneity of the Fund is the fact that its character&#13;
is very much more a European character and that derives from the fact that the head of&#13;
the Fund has always been a European. And, if you look at it in proportionate terms as&#13;
well, the number of people who come to the Fund who come from financial institutions&#13;
and in particular from central banks is much greater, and central banks tend to have a&#13;
very homogeneous culture all over the world, you know, even to the issue of whether you&#13;
take wine at lunch or don't take wine with lunch, you know. There is a very special&#13;
homogeneity to that particular culture. The third thing about the Fund is, which has&#13;
resulted in that homogeneity, is the fact that youâ&#128;&#153;re dealing with a relatively or had been&#13;
historically dealing with a relatively narrow problem which could be solved in more or&#13;
less the same or similar fashion. Now, the people in the Fund will deny that, but see, this&#13;
happened to be the reason why I left the Fund. I certainly believed that was the case.&#13;
&#13;
You see, it is perfectly intellectually possible to go to Morocco and go to Pakistan, the&#13;
country, and say to both of them, you know, "Hereâ&#128;&#153;s your budget deficit. This is what&#13;
you've done wrong with your credit policy and so forth, and therefore there is an&#13;
imbalance between overall monetary demand and the supply side of resources, and&#13;
therefore this imbalance must be cured by making sure that you cut your cloth to the&#13;
resources that you have. And therefore do this, cut this, cut this, cut this, bring this into&#13;
balance, and hopefullyâ&#128;&#148;and we'll give you some temporary support for it and over a&#13;
three-year period your balance of payments position is going to be okay.â&#128;? I'm admittedly&#13;
putting a very simplistic version of what the Fund does, but in its earlier history the Fund&#13;
did something very much along these lines. Now it's trying to get a little bit more&#13;
sophisticated, a little bit more like the Bank with its longer-term structural adjustments,&#13;
this, that and the other, but the essence of it remains the same.&#13;
&#13;
So the reason why I left the Fund--and I don't want this to be particularly in your history&#13;
or be quoted--is because I was bored. I was bored in doing the same thing again and&#13;
again even though I went into different countries, and I have led 23 missions for the&#13;
Fund, and I don't know how many stand-by arrangements I have negotiated for the Fund.&#13;
So I was a very active member in high regard with the management, very close to the&#13;
management in the Fund, but I was bored. I was really intellectually bored. And the&#13;
reason I came to IFC was I thought, â&#128;&#156;Here is a new way. I learn a different trade,&#13;
&#13;
                                    Moeen Qureshi&#13;
                              April 5, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
almost,â&#128;? because IFC even more than the Bank seemed much more different to me than&#13;
the Fund was. So, you know, that was the reason I left the Fund. That is what the&#13;
homogeneity of the Fund is.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what you call the â&#128;&#156;pluralitiesâ&#128;? that might find expression, the reality is not that&#13;
nice. It is true that the Bank is not as homogeneous, but not always for good reasons.&#13;
First, to compare it stylistically, the Bank has been headed by essentially Wall Street&#13;
types for most of its history until [Robert S.] McNamara came, okay? And those people&#13;
had a tremendous impact on the culture of the Bank, firstly, unlike the central bank&#13;
governors who always deal with their boards in a certain kind of a way, these people&#13;
tended to be much more autocratic, much more authoritarian, much more believers in&#13;
centralized management, you know, "buck stops here" kind of a philosophy. And they&#13;
brought, even in cultural terms, the culture of major commercial banking institutions and&#13;
later on to some extent investment banking institutions from New York to the Bank. In&#13;
other words, to give you an example, yes, it is perfectly appropriate, you could have a&#13;
glass of sherry, but you must never drink wine at lunch. It was never done, you know.&#13;
And so that was the kind of a culture they brought. And they also brought this very&#13;
centralized and, you know, management is the responsibility of the president. Even the&#13;
titles reflect both the cultures of the place: president of the Bank, managing director of&#13;
the Fund. You know, this word, he's a director, but he's a manager, you know, the chief&#13;
manager; the president is the president. He's the president of the staff and the chairman&#13;
of the Board of Executive Directors. And make no mistake about it: [Eugene R.] Black&#13;
and [George D.] Woods in particular and McNamara in his own way were very, very&#13;
effective, in a sense, heads of the institution and dealt with the Boards in a way that did&#13;
not make the Board unhappy but did not allow a lot of power to rest with the Boards, so&#13;
that certainly is . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We've heard that distinction, that the Board, particularly the Bank Board, has&#13;
not since [John J.] McCloy, I guess, had very much initiative; it hasn't been able to take&#13;
initiatives. Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: That's not--yes and no. I mean, itâ&#128;&#153;s a--let me put it, if you talk to a Board&#13;
member, the Board member will say, "You know, this is really terrible. The Bank Board&#13;
is really much less effective than the Fund Board is." That is probably true, but in a very&#13;
different kind of a way from what was intended. In the Bank, the Articles of Agreement&#13;
give all the authority on spending money to the Board and all the authority on policy&#13;
formulation to the Board. Nothing can be spent without the Board's approval, and&#13;
nothing can be approved of a policy nature than the Board. Where the Board is less&#13;
powerful is that in the Fund they do get into appointments--and even of division chiefs&#13;
and so forth--which go to the Board for information or approval or in various ways. In&#13;
the Bank that was always seen as a separate preserve of the head of the staff, who was the&#13;
president, and therefore he may, when he wants to appoint a--originally when there were&#13;
no senior vice presidents, there were only vice presidents in the Bank--when he wanted to&#13;
appoint a vice president he would inform the Board, but, you know, that was it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Moeen Qureshi&#13;
                             April 5, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I'll give you my own case. When I was appointed executive vice president, which is the&#13;
chief operating officer of IFC, when I was appointed that, McNamara (I was vice&#13;
president at that time in IFC) called me at 11 o'clock . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Morning or night?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Morning. Called me at 11 o'clock in the morning and said, "Moeen,&#13;
Ladislaus von Hoffmann (my predecessor) has resigned, and I want to offer you the&#13;
executive vice president position. Do you accept?"&#13;
&#13;
And there was some discussion about this and I said, "Yes, I accept, but I have a&#13;
condition." We'll come back to that in a moment, but the point is--so after acceptance he&#13;
called the Board at 2:30 to a special session and informed them he had decided to&#13;
nominate me as the next executive vice president; Ladislaus von Hoffman had resigned at&#13;
that point. He did not even want to send a note to the Board in advance to give them time&#13;
to think because he didn't want people to come around and tell him who was their&#13;
favorite candidate to become the next executive vice president and so on.&#13;
&#13;
That says something for the relationships with the Board on that issue, but if it was a&#13;
question of the budget, I tell you, Bob would have, you know, the British Executive&#13;
Director having lunch with him or breakfast with him or something or the other weeks in&#13;
advance, and he would be massaging him and telling him what the problems were and&#13;
how he wanted to do it and the same with the French one and so on and so forth and by&#13;
the time the budget came round he'd got everybody, you know, pretty keyed up. And,&#13;
you know, he was very good at exploiting both their strengths and weaknesses, and he&#13;
would say, â&#128;&#156;Do you have a problem with London on this thing? I can easily call the&#13;
Chancellor, I'll call him if you want me to, so that you can relax." And so no Executive&#13;
Director wants the chancellor to be called, you know, to be given a set of instructions.&#13;
So, you know, he was extremely effective in that type of thing. And of course he had&#13;
made sure that he knew the chancellors and everyone else very well in this sort of a thing,&#13;
but what I'm saying is that he made a clear distinction in the way he handled that,&#13;
between that kind of issue and this kind of a, what he consider to be purely an internal&#13;
management issue in which the Board had nothing to do with it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Does the Board have any more de facto voice in policy, in decision making&#13;
since McNamara?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Oh, absolutely. Oh, yes. Oh, absolutely. I think that the Board has a great&#13;
deal of not only voice but authority. The trouble is that since you have these two Boards,&#13;
you have in the Bank Board to a much greater extent a polarity between, a polarization&#13;
between two groups which you have to a much lesser extent in the Fund. In the Bank&#13;
Board you have a group of borrowers and a group of people who are not borrowers but&#13;
are not by themselves creditors either. Some of their markets are available for the Bank&#13;
to borrow in, but theyâ&#128;&#153;re essentially sitting there representing their governments in the&#13;
nature more or less of armchair critics of what the borrowers are doing.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the case of the Fund you have a more homogeneous Board by virtue of the nature of&#13;
the business of the Fund. You don't have borrowers and armchair critics. You have&#13;
every country that comes in for review. The U.K. comes in for an Article IV&#13;
consultation, so does the United States, and so every director has an opportunity to&#13;
expatiate on all of the problems that exist. And in the context of the United States the&#13;
director from Zambia can say, "Well, you know, why aren't they relaxing their textile&#13;
quotas and so forth. Why this there that and the other?â&#128;? So there is this feeling of&#13;
participation, even if it is only to some extent cosmetic, but it is there, and a sense of&#13;
equality.&#13;
&#13;
On the Bank Board, as I said, you've got borrowers, and all the projects and programs&#13;
that come before the Board have to do with the borrowers. They, of course, are keenly&#13;
interested in those projects and programs, whereas you know the Americans and the&#13;
British and the French and everyone sits there and says, "Now shouldn't you be harder on&#13;
these guys before you put in this thing or that thing?" So that results in a certain&#13;
polarization to begin with. And therefore you have the endless debates in the Bank Board&#13;
these days as to how far should we go in discussion of lending strategy and discussion of&#13;
this strategy and that strategy, and it comes from the asymmetry that exists between&#13;
different interests in the Bank's Board.&#13;
&#13;
So in the Bank's Board now the Part I directors would like nothing better than if they&#13;
would convert themselves into, quote, "the Fund Board," discussing policies all the time&#13;
and, you know, telling everybody what to do. The only problem is that then you'll be&#13;
discussing only the policies of one group of countries, and the other group of countries is&#13;
very reluctant to entertain that kind of process, as in the Fund's Board, because they feel&#13;
it is just directed at them, and they don't have any opportunity to do the other side on this&#13;
issue. So that's one part of it. You know, the Board feels, ah, particularly the Part I&#13;
countries, that the Board isn't really as effective in the Bank as it should be, okay?&#13;
&#13;
Now the management has a difficult role here. The management doesn't mind at all if&#13;
you discuss policies because the management has to work on policies anyway. But on&#13;
the other hand it doesn't want to tilt so far in the direction of Part I countries that it is&#13;
identified as merely projecting their point of view. So the Bank is in the difficult role of&#13;
balancing these aspects.&#13;
&#13;
Now, there's a second thing. The second thing is that, you know, irrespective of where&#13;
they are from, all directors would like to have little bit of a . .&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Start Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: . . the management has tried to keep Part II countries also somewhat at bay.&#13;
In the case of the Fund when somebody asks whether you will have a program in the&#13;
United States (there's only been one transaction in the United States), the Fund has no&#13;
difficulty in saying, "Well, you know, yes, we are discussing this with the United States&#13;
because the United States has asked for it" because it is a crisis-oriented institution and&#13;
&#13;
                                    Moeen Qureshi&#13;
                              April 5, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
then when there is a crisis everybody knows that they are doing this. The Bank works on&#13;
a continuing basis, whether there is a crisis or not a crisis. I have a program every year in&#13;
over a hundred countries, you know, and that program may be less or lower or higher, but&#13;
there is a program going on. There is therefore a very strong tendency on the part of Part&#13;
I directors, just like Part II directors--the borrowers, in other words--who want to know&#13;
what are they going to get and to have specific interest in individual projects.&#13;
&#13;
Now, we are very reluctant, therefore, to discuss with the Board--because we can't just&#13;
discuss with one group of directors and not discuss it with another group of directors--&#13;
specific lending programs in particular countries. We will tell them what our aggregate&#13;
expectations are or orders of the magnitude, what our priorities are, what our main thrust&#13;
is, what our policy emphasis is: all of that is fine. But if it comes to saying, â&#128;&#156;Would I do&#13;
250 million dollars of lending in Zambia which will go to a highway project or a&#13;
structural adjustment loan or whatever?â&#128;? then I am not quite prepared to go and discuss&#13;
this specifically with the Board because I don't want to get into a situation where&#13;
individual directors are pushing me on individual projects which they would like to see&#13;
come up or individual programs they would like to see come up in their own countries,&#13;
you see, because that would clearly be a conflict of interest situation.&#13;
&#13;
This situation doesn't exist in the Fund, so this kind of a reticence also gives some&#13;
directors the excuse to say, "Ah, but we're not getting into it in as much detail as the Fund&#13;
is getting into it." But the Fund doesn't get into these kinds of issues except in a crisis&#13;
situation, and then of course the crisis has to be discussed with the Board anyway. So&#13;
there are several of these very fundamental reasons for differences between the Bank&#13;
Board, and I think a simple statement that they are less effective than the Fund Board is&#13;
really not correct. This is not true. It may be the perception of some directors, but it is&#13;
certainly not my perception.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What would you see as the Bank Board's principal contribution?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Principal contribution? They are the people who approve all policies, and,&#13;
you know, they adapt, they mold, they approve, they change policies of the Board.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: They do?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Oh, yes. Absolutely. Now, under the . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Passively, largely?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Not passively, I tell you, not passively at all. I think, in fact, too intrusively&#13;
for my taste. The word "passive" is--you've almost provoked me by saying that word.&#13;
You know, particularly the larger shareholders, they really throw their weight around, far&#13;
more than they ever did before, far more than they ever did before. That doesn't&#13;
necessarily mean that we just kow-tow to them and merely say, "Yes, yes, yes," but they&#13;
can use occasions to put on an enormous amount of pressure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Moeen Qureshi&#13;
                             April 5, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
You see, the management of any institution obviously wants some flexibility and some&#13;
support. That is natural. But in the case of the World Bank where you have always had&#13;
American presidents it is particularly important for an American president not to be seen&#13;
and not to be perceived as merely an extension of U.S. policy. It is important for his own&#13;
independence. It doesn't matter that in the large majority of cases it may very well be&#13;
that we would come to the same conclusions that the U.S. would come to anyway. And&#13;
all studies have shown that in the large majority of cases that is the case. That is true.&#13;
That, you know, the U.S. Treasury did a study a few years ago which came precisely to&#13;
this conclusion. It was done by the U.S. Treasury for the U.S. administration on lending.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: When [Ronald W.] Reagan Administration came in.&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Exactly. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. And they put the study, and it came to the&#13;
conclusion--the conclusion was that over the whole period of the Bank what the Bank had&#13;
been doing was very much in the U.S. interest, not against the U.S. interest. It could&#13;
hardly identify one instance which had, in the long perspective of the Bank, had proved&#13;
to be fundamentally against the U.S. interest. There was not one. There were incidents&#13;
where there was a disagreement between the U.S. and the Bank, several instances of that,&#13;
but they have not found that over the, with the benefit of hindsight, that the positions that&#13;
the Bank took have proved to be fundamentally against the U.S. interest.&#13;
&#13;
Now, but it is important, I started out by saying that there should be that clear distinction&#13;
between--what was the question? I'm sorry; I've lost my chain of thought.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You were provoked by the word "passive."&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you. I was provoked&#13;
by the word â&#128;&#156;passiveâ&#128;? because, you know, the U.S. has a tendency, particularly the U.S.&#13;
because it is the largest shareholder to begin with, and it has a tendency sometimes to&#13;
throw its weight around. And I think it is very important that while we must do things&#13;
which we think are right that they notâ&#128;&#148;that they be seen to be done because we think&#13;
that they are right, not because the U.S. throws its weight around.&#13;
&#13;
I'll give you an example of this, which is a current example. The U.S. is taking a very&#13;
strong line in terms of all kinds of changes and adjustments and so forth that the Bank&#13;
should make in order to promote private sector development. Now, there can be no&#13;
question whatsoever that private sector development is an emerging priority for the next&#13;
decades in developing countries for a variety of reasons--if you want to talk about it, I&#13;
would be glad to talk about it because I have a lot of background on this particular issue.&#13;
I can tell you from my own experience, though, that you couldn't have someone who was&#13;
more pro-private sector development than I am. I have spent so many years of my life,&#13;
eleven and a half in IFC, heading the IFC for four and a half years, you know, that I&#13;
clearly couldn't be more in that camp. But nonetheless when I think of what it is the&#13;
Bank should appropriately do, I am not going to merely go by what is great and would&#13;
look great or sound great for the U.S. if it wants to go and push for IFC's capital increase.&#13;
I have to make sure that what the Bank does is, number one, consistent with its own&#13;
&#13;
                                    Moeen Qureshi&#13;
                              April 5, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Articles of Agreement, and the Articles of Agreement do indicate certain criteria that&#13;
have to be kept in mind. I also have to make sure that the Bank is not perceived as being,&#13;
as pushing this on grounds of ideology but does so because there are grounds of&#13;
efficiency and increased productivity that are being pursued. Thirdly, promoting private&#13;
sector development, mostly indirectly, such as by creating enabling environments,&#13;
building financial institutions and access to capital, such as making sure that divestiture&#13;
and privatization programs are supported and the effective increases in public sector are&#13;
somehow or the other staffed and restructured and so on and so forth, parastatal reforms&#13;
take place. All of those kinds of things have to be approached in an institutional way.&#13;
And so, you know, the U.S. has a tendency to suddenly come up and say, "Well, you&#13;
must do this or you don't get capital increases, you don't get that and you don't get this."&#13;
&#13;
Now, in all fairness I must also say that the U.S. doesnâ&#128;&#153;t do this shooting from the hip&#13;
because it loves to shoot from the hip. It does this because it is very concerned about&#13;
Congressional reaction to a possible IFC capital increase and concerned about how it can&#13;
reinforce its case and make it look more sexy and things of that nature. But nevertheless&#13;
my principal objective as the head of operations of the World Bank is not to satisfy the&#13;
U.S. Congress. My principal objective is to make sure that the operations of the World&#13;
Bank achieve the objectives that we have set for ourselves as our goals, long-term goals.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It's a minor point in a way, but when the U.S. throws its weight around like&#13;
this, I take it it doesn't do it primarily via its own ED. It does it by telephone calls from&#13;
Treasury, doesn't it? No?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Anything that they think might be effective. But all of these things&#13;
therefore--certainly ED is nothing else, after all, than the representative of the U.S. on our&#13;
Board, and he is obviously the person who must frequently be day-to-day the spokesman&#13;
for the Treasury, but if they feel that more pressure is needed, then they will do it directly&#13;
and they will go up the ladder if necessary and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
But this is not confined to the U.S. I mean, other countries will do that, too, from time to&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And they also will communicate directly from capitols sometimes?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Sure, absolutely. This will happen, too, but you see, there are two or three&#13;
reasons why the U.S. tends to be somewhat more of a problem in this case than other&#13;
countries. First, of course, it's the largest shareholder, and, you know, you have to have a&#13;
certain amount of weight and gravitas if you are the largest shareholder, and I must take&#13;
that seriously, too. The fact that they have 18 percent of the capital of the Bank means&#13;
something to me. You know, I'm not oblivious to that particular fact. And therefore,&#13;
they have some reason for being concerned about the institution behind which they are&#13;
putting their support to that extent, the capital of the institution and the guaranteed capital&#13;
of the institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Moeen Qureshi&#13;
                              April 5, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The second thing, however, is that we are located in Washington. So, you know, if we&#13;
were located in London I can tell you the British government would be much more&#13;
sensitive to certain perceptions and so forth. And there are all kinds of rational and&#13;
irrational perceptions that do emerge because of our location in Washington. One&#13;
obvious one is the fact that here you've got a group of "highly-paid," you know, within&#13;
quotation marks, people, wogs, many of them from the outside who are being paid all that&#13;
much more than people in the U.S. administration and why? Are they that much more&#13;
competent? Or is their work? All kinds of problems arise because of that, and that has--&#13;
and this is my point here in giving that example--that all of that feeds into the conflicts.&#13;
And since the institution is very heavily dependent on U.S. supportâ&#128;&#148;and make no&#13;
mistake about it, that we are very conscious of that particular point, that we must have the&#13;
U.S. support. Without it this would be a very weak institution. That makes this kind of a&#13;
pressure group much more potent than would otherwise be the case.&#13;
&#13;
Now, finally there is another aspect of U.S., a thing that makes it more troublesome, and&#13;
that is the U.S. government is such a large, such a sort of an enormous thing, you know,&#13;
with its left hand not always knowing what its right hand is doing, and the Treasury&#13;
having one position and State having another position and someone else having a third&#13;
position and the Congress all on its own, that your dealing with this whole apparatus is a&#13;
much more time-consuming and difficult thing than dealing with a simple parliamentary&#13;
government where Mr. [John] Major tells you this is what the British government thinks&#13;
and you know you can forget about everything else. You can't forget about that in the&#13;
case of the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Itâ&#128;&#153;s a good point. I don't know how much time youâ&#128;&#153;ve . . .&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: I think we almost can have another five minutes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay. Let me just ask you, I think when we talk another time we want to talk&#13;
more about IFC, but am I right in thinking that McNamara somewhat diminished the role&#13;
or the prospects of IFC?&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Not at all.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s not right.&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: Absolutely not. In fact, you know, I was very proud of the fact that during&#13;
my period when I was head of IFC the activities of IFC measured by the volume&#13;
increased by nearly three times during those four and a half years, and it could not have&#13;
been done without the encouragement of McNamara and without his support because&#13;
McNamara was a very, very, in many ways a very authoritarian head of the Bank. But&#13;
McNamara in some respects is the kind of a person who divides people into groups and&#13;
categories, and, you know, there are people he trusts who can be expected to do the right&#13;
thing and people who don't have his trust. And if you manage to have his confidence and&#13;
his trust, then you, you know, you can do even sometimes silly things and get away with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Moeen Qureshi&#13;
                             April 5, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
it. He will notâ&#128;&#148;he will be supportive of you. And so he's a little bit like that, and I was&#13;
one of, quote, McNamara's protÃ©gÃ©s at that time.&#13;
&#13;
The second thing about McNamara was thatâ&#128;&#148;you see, IFC is even now a very small&#13;
institution compared to the Bank. Secondly, the kinds of issues that McNamara was&#13;
principally interested in cannot effectively be pursued through IFC. Issues of equity,&#13;
issues of poverty alleviation, issues of bringing social sector development, you know, to&#13;
vast segments of people in the developing world are not effectively pursued through IFC,&#13;
okay? So basically McNamara left me alone as long as I--and I very rigorously and&#13;
punctiliously did that--provided him with a monthly report on everything that I did and&#13;
went to him on any issue where there could be any deviation from the policy that had&#13;
been established. I made sure that I gave him that. You see, McNamara is in some&#13;
respects a very good manager and in other respects he's really quite difficult to deal with&#13;
but to deal with McNamara you have to be very systematic. You have to have a plan of&#13;
activities, both a physical one and a financial one. And, mind you, you have to have that&#13;
for the next one year, for the next six months, you've got to have it for the next five years,&#13;
you've got to have it even for the next twenty years.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, McNamara operates with figures, not because he necessarily believes that&#13;
those figures are right. I mean, he has really himself a very sensible attitude to this thing.&#13;
What he says is, "If you are able to give me your figures, even if they are very rough and&#13;
so on, you are much better in quantifying it and quantifying your own instincts or even&#13;
impressions than I would be as your manager. If you put it down for me, then I have a&#13;
much better judgment as to what I should be doing because I have called out your&#13;
capacity and your recommendations and I can then decide upon that particular issue."&#13;
And then he, you know, if you tell him on those kinds of things and he trusts you that&#13;
you're not finagling this or that or the other, then he leaves you alone. Now, he wouldn't&#13;
leave me alone in the Bank because with him the Bank was everything, but the IFC was a&#13;
sideshow, and so: "Here is Qureshi. I trust Qureshi. I like Qureshi. I know he delivers&#13;
what I want delivered, and so I'm not going toâ&#128;&#148;you know, Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to support him.&#13;
But I'm not going to go and worry about what's happening in IFC.â&#128;? This was his attitude&#13;
towards me. But that didn't mean that I could do anything that was inconsistent with&#13;
what McNamaraâ&#128;&#148;what I had discussed with McNamara and agreed with McNamara.&#13;
And I can tell you he would read every table, every page, every little thing--even a&#13;
footnote--that I would send to him. So with McNamara you can take absolutelyâ&#128;&#148;I mean,&#13;
he's right on top of everything that you're doing, even to the prices of burlap sacks and&#13;
gunny bags and, you know, things like that. Thereâ&#128;&#153;re some very interesting stories about&#13;
that, but anyway he is a person that I really admire very much for his strengths and so&#13;
forth.&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;ll give you one little story before you go, which in a sense typifies McNamara on this&#13;
issue of quantifications. I was in IFC, and at that time I was sort of head of the economic&#13;
side and head of the capital market department of IFC. And Bob McNamara asked Bill&#13;
[William S.] Gaud, who was then the head of IFC, that he wanted--he wasn't satisfied&#13;
with what the Bank was doing in the industrial sector. He wanted an industrial sector&#13;
report to be written, what the Bank should do, the whole Bank group should do in, what&#13;
&#13;
                                    Moeen Qureshi&#13;
                              April 5, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the management of the Bank should aim at doing in this sector over the next five years.&#13;
So I was asked to write that report. After struggle with all kinds of people in the Bank I&#13;
eventually managed to write this report, and I sent it to Bob. And I suddenly found that&#13;
in order to send that report I had to say--this is basically a five-year program--and I had to&#13;
write how many staff weeks would be spent on the lending work, how many staff weeks&#13;
would be spent on supervision during this five-year period. In other words, he would&#13;
know how many people would be deployed and, you know, what kind of an effort would&#13;
be made. So I made some very rough calculations based on the degree, the size of the&#13;
program that I thought would be appropriate, and so forth. On the lending program I said&#13;
so much would be required, and where there was supervision I said clearly, "Very&#13;
difficult to estimate this, so I have not made that estimate," and I wrote a little note to&#13;
Bob that I hadn't done that because clearly this was pure guesswork, and I could really&#13;
see no point in doing it.&#13;
&#13;
Well, back came my report after he had read it, and he had clearly read every page of that&#13;
thing, and on front of that he had written, "Please do it!" So I did it. You know, I just&#13;
took a figure and so forth and did it! At that time I was still in great awe. I was fairly&#13;
junior, I was the head of a department, and wasn't, you know, vice president or senior&#13;
vice president, executive vice president of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
But eventually when I did become executive vice president of IFC and I was reallyâ&#128;&#148;you&#13;
know, I had very good friendly relations with Bob--so one of these days I was a little&#13;
relaxed I said, "Bob, I never could understand why you asked me to do that. I didn't&#13;
really do anything. When you said to me, 'Do it!' I just put a figure in." And then he&#13;
explained to me, "I don't remember that incident, but I think I do that because your&#13;
instinctive judgment after you've worked on that thing is probably better than mine would&#13;
be, and this gives me a certain order of magnitude as to what should be done."&#13;
&#13;
The problem with this whole approach was, it was fine for McNamara. The trouble is&#13;
that that figure that I had put in, three years later I suddenly found the thing repeated as if&#13;
it was some very important, you know factual statement, that must be observed and the&#13;
institution must go by it, and things of that nature. So for McNamara this was all right,&#13;
but what it did then to the rest of the institution's perceptions about some of those things,&#13;
you know, was totally excessive.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's very good!&#13;
&#13;
QURESHI: But he was a very bright, inspirational guy to work with.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He is.&#13;
