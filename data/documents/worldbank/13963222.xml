        <abstracts>
            The world around us is changing, and so
            is International Finance Corporation (IFC). In a time of
            uncertainty in world markets, IFC have stepped up
            investments and advisory services in the least developed
            economies and sectors. IFC's efforts to respond swiftly
            to clients' needs are making a difference. IFC are
            creating new opportunities for people to break free from
            poverty and improve their lives. IFC clients generated power
            for nearly 147 million customers in developing countries and
            distributed water to 18 million consumers in the most recent
            year for which statistics are available. IFC strengthened
            the managerial capabilities of small and midsize firms in
            many countries, training more than 20,000 entrepreneurs many
            of them women through IFC's business edge program. IFC
            helped increase the availability of credit, assisting in
            providing nearly 7 million microfinance loans and more than
            500,000 housing finance loans. IFC are the largest
            multilateral financial institution investing in private
            enterprises in emerging market countries. IFC combine
            financing that helps IFC's clients grow quickly and
            sustainably with advice that helps them innovate, raise
            standards, mitigate risk, and share knowledge across
            industries and regions. IFC's affiliation with the
            World Bank Group gives us additional leverage in terms of
            skills and experience. This unparalleled set of comparative
            advantages is the main reason clients choose to work with us.
