This report is based on sector discussions over the period 1993-1995 between the Government and the Bank&#13;
and Association and CDB. A team of international and local consultants and counterparts conducted studies&#13;
of various aspects of the sector between May 1994 and February 1995. Those reports then formed the basis&#13;
of the proposed project. A reconnaissance/identification mission of February 1995 was followed by a&#13;
preparation mission of April 1995. In June/July 1995, a Bank/IDA mission comprising Ms. Karen&#13;
Lashman, Principal Operations Officer (LA3HR), Messrs. Ralph Romain, Principal Education Specialist&#13;
(HDD), and Marco Mantovanelli, Consultant (LA3HR) visited Dominica and appraised the proposed&#13;
project. Ms. Marie-Christine Theodore provided support in document production. Peer reviewers, Ms.&#13;
Marlaine Lockheed (HDD) and Mr. Richard Cambridge (SA2DR), reviewed the IEPS for the OECS Basic&#13;
Education Project from which this project was developed. The Department Director, Project Adviser and&#13;
Sector Division Chief were Messieurs Paul Isenman, Robert Crown, and Julian Schweitzer, respectively.&#13;

COMMONWEALTH OF DOMINICA&#13;
BASIC EDUCATION REFORM PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   The Commonwealth of Dominica is one of the member countries of the Organization of Eastern&#13;
Caribbean States (OECS), with a current population of 71,1831. A small island economy with difficult&#13;
terrain, a paucity of financial and human resources, and a narrow production base (primarily bananas),&#13;
Dominica is also subject to natural disasters. Production of bananas, the main agricultural crop, is not&#13;
competitive with Central American bananas and exports depend upon preferential access to the United&#13;
Kingdom under the Lome Convention. The Government which came into power in 1980 confronted&#13;
major rehabilitation efforts following hurricane damage. Reconstruction of infrastructure was financed&#13;
with the assistance of donors, including IDA. This reconstruction program was accompanied by a&#13;
stabilization program supported by the IMF. The reforms brought about improvement in public finances,&#13;
but these were temporary and did not invoke a sufficient response from the rest of the economy.&#13;
1.2   The stagnation of the economy in 1985 (GDP growth of 1.3% compared with 5.5% in 1984),&#13;
due mainly to diminished agricultural and manufacturing exports, prompted the launch of a Structural&#13;
Adjustm-ent Program in 1986. During the first two years of the program, macroeconomic targets were&#13;
exceeded. The end of 1989, however, marked a shift in the performance of the economy and the&#13;
Government's ability to respond rapidly to changes in the external environment. Hurricane "Hugo"&#13;
(September 1989) caused considerable damage to banana production and exports, slowing growth&#13;
significantly. Additionally, with the turn of the decade, unfavorable movements in the pound&#13;
sterling/EC$ exchange rate had a negative impact on export performance. Fiscal discipline weakened as&#13;
the Government granted a large civil service wage increase of 21% and started financing major&#13;
investment projects through borrowing from domestic banks and bilateral agencies. In 1994 the&#13;
Government managed to improve its fiscal performance slightly by stepping up its tax collections,&#13;
reducing the size of civil service through attrition by about 8% and containing its expenditure on goods&#13;
and services. Tourism has also expanded recently and there are reasons for some cautious optimism.&#13;
However, the country is still facing a difficult period of economic transition coupled with a stringent&#13;
fiscal situation worsened by severe storm damages to infrastructure and agriculture occurred during the&#13;
1995 hurricane season. The indications are that, while the situation is difficult, Dominica needs to invest&#13;
its way out of the problem.&#13;
1.3   To this end, the Government recognizes that it must accelerate diversification while rapidly&#13;
increasing the efficiency of banana production. The success of this desired economic transition will&#13;
depend in part on human resource development, to ensure the labor force required for an increasingly&#13;
competitive international economy. To secure the requisite modem labor force, standards of education&#13;
and learning must be raised significantly. This will necessitate a major reform of its education sector,&#13;
with special attention to enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the system, and the equity of&#13;
access to educational opportunities.&#13;

2. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. Current Educational Situation&#13;
2.1    Despite the severe fiscal crisis, Government commitment to education in Dominica is strong.&#13;
As a proportion of total government expenditure, Dominica has allocated, on average, just over 17&#13;
percent of its recurrent budget to education annually over the 1989-1994 period, a level generally above&#13;
world averages. However, recurrent expenditure in the education sector over the period rose at a slower&#13;
pace (44.8 percent) than the total recurrent budget, (56.6 percent). The sector suffered its share of budget&#13;
cuts, especially in areas such as maintenance of school plant and the provision of school supplies and&#13;
materials that can entail long term weaknesses. Yet, universal coverage at the primary level has been&#13;
attained, with a gross enrollment rate of 121.2% in 1994/5 representin g an enrollment in public and&#13;
private schools of 14,320 pupils compared to a 5-11 cohort of 11,818.&#13;
2.2    The primary network consists of 59 public schools (of which 5 are government assisted) and 5&#13;
private schools. Though primary school coverage has increased, the actual number of children enrolled&#13;
in primary schools has been falling slightly but steadily in recent years (amid a slowdown in population&#13;
growth to a current annual negative rate of 0.3% percent) from a peak enrollment of 16,833 in the&#13;
1984/85 academic year (Annex 2, Figure IA). At present population growth rates, the 5-14 age group is&#13;
projected to decline further until around the Year 2001, and then remain more or less constant.&#13;

2.3    The attainment of almost universal coverage at the primary level, however, masks serious&#13;
inequities in access to learning opportunities. A recently completed school mapping exercise, observed&#13;
the under-utilization of many facilities (with the notable exception of the schools in the North-West )&#13;
while many of the schools of the capital (Roseau) are overcrowded. Much of the physical infrastructure&#13;
is in poor condition, in some cases posing safety and health dangers to children and teachers. About 25%&#13;
2The approximately 21 percent excess enrolltnent over population appears to be due to the repetition rate, to a small&#13;
number of children under the age of five enrolled in primary school, and to the enrollment of students of age&#13;
12+ , including 1,976 students enrolled in the three years of the Junior Secondary Program (JSP), in the&#13;
primnary "all-age" schools.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of a total of 554 classrooms at primary level should be replaced, and about 35% are in need of serious&#13;
rehabilitation works.&#13;
2.4    Serious access problems exist at the secondary level of the education system, with transition&#13;
rates from primary to secondary education among the lowest in the OECS. Of every 1,000 children&#13;
entering primary school, only about 400 continue their education into the secondary cycle. In 1994/95,&#13;
only 4,289 students were accommodated in the nation's 13 public secondary schools (which comprise 5&#13;
government and 8 government-assisted), (Annex 2, Table 1C) while the only private secondary school&#13;
accommodated an additional 222, altogether representing about 54 percent (net of repeaters over 16&#13;
years of age) of the 12-16 age cohort. There is also an uneven distribution of school places (the 13&#13;
public schools are located in only 5 of the 10 parishes) with high concentration of schools--about 47% of&#13;
the places-- in the Roseau area, thus imposing high school transport costs on families living in areas of&#13;
the island more remote from the capital.&#13;
2.5    The low transition rates from primary to secondary reflect constraints in the supply of secondary&#13;
places, not in the demand for them. This demand has been met in recent years, by expanding existing&#13;
schools or converting lower cycle junior secondary schools into five-year schools (Annex 2, Table 4).&#13;
The 98 percent completion rate for those who enter secondary schools reflects the high value attached to&#13;
such education by those students who gain entry and their families.&#13;
2.6    Notwithstanding progress made to date in expanding access to secondary education, the overall&#13;
shortfall in places remains significant. With a current cohort of secondary school age (i.e., 12-16 years)&#13;
of some 7,500 youth, even with the planned addition of 735 secondary places under this proposed&#13;
project, universal coverage would not be attainable until well into the first decade of the next century&#13;
unless significant additional resources can be mobilized and/or efficiency measures instituted to release&#13;
resources for further expansion of places.&#13;
2.7   In the light of the shortage of secondary school places, access to secondary education depends, as&#13;
in the other OECS countries and elsewhere in the Caribbean, on performance in the competitive&#13;
Common Entrance Examination (CEE) (Annex 2, Table 2A), commonly known as the 11+ exam, given&#13;
at the end of Standard 7, equivalent to Grade 6. Since only about one in two children gains entry to&#13;
secondary education, the stakes on this exam are exceptionally high, as perceived by students, parents&#13;
and teachers alike. Consequently, succeeding in the CEE becomes the driving force of primary&#13;
education, particularly at the upper grade levels, thereby substantially distorting teaching practices away&#13;
from mastery of the curricula and toward the areas to be tested by the exam.&#13;
2.8    Each year significant numbers of the children who do not win a place in the secondary school&#13;
continue in all-age primary schools enrolled in the Junior Secondary Program (JSP) which is&#13;
supplemented by practical subject centers for home economics and industrial arts. For the vast majority&#13;
of these students, this schooling reflects the terminal point in their formal education, except for a&#13;
fortunate few who receive a second chance in the 14+ exam known as the Dominica Junior Secondary&#13;
Program Examination (JSPE), on the results of which they may be placed in available places at the Form&#13;
3 level at regular secondary schools, in effect repeating one year of schooling, thus graduating from&#13;
Form 5 one year later than if they had entered through the CEE.3&#13;
3In 1994 about 600 candidates sat the exam and only 120 gained access to Fonn III in the five-year secondary&#13;
school cycle.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.9    The shortages of qualified teachers in the upper grades at the all-age schools, coupled with the&#13;
noted lower standards applied in the curricula, suggest limited value-added to the education of youth&#13;
within the program, thus also exacerbating problems of their absorption into the labor force upon leaving&#13;
school.&#13;
B. The Organizational Structure and Institutional Framework&#13;
2.10   As in other countries in the sub-region, the education system of Dominica is organized into four&#13;
principal levels--pre-school, primary, secondary and tertiary education (Annex 2, Chart 1). For the&#13;
purposes of this Report, Basic Education comprises the primary grades (age 5-11) and the lower cycle of&#13;
secondary education (age 12-14). Pre-school education is voluntary and still in its early stages of&#13;
development. In 1992-1993, 2,369 children were enrolled in pre-school programs, which are privately&#13;
financed, with a small Government contribution (EC$ 42,000 in the 1994/95 Estimates) to selected&#13;
centers. Compulsory education applies to children aged 5-15. The primary level comprises seven grades&#13;
called "standards", ending at "Standard 7" which corresponds to Grade 6 in the international&#13;
terminology.4&#13;
2.11   Those students who obtain the best scores on the CEE taken at the end of Grade 7 are assigned to&#13;
secondary schools where they pursue a five-year course of study, organized into Forms 1-5. Upon&#13;
completion of Form 5, those students who perform well enough in the Caribbean Examinations Council&#13;
(CXC) and/or the General Certification Examination (GCE) have the option of moving into tertiary&#13;
education; the remainder move into the labor market.&#13;
2.12   At the tertiary level, the Clifton Dupigny College (CDC) offers associate degree courses in Arts&#13;
and Applied Arts and Science and Applied Sciences, courses towards Craftsman and Technician&#13;
certificates and classes in Adult and Continuing Education. The Teacher Training College (TTC) offers&#13;
GCE advanced level courses, towards a Teacher's Diploma. Those students wishing to pursue more&#13;
advanced studies attend overseas institutions, colleges and universities.&#13;
2.13   Primary responsibility for educational policy and programs is vested in the Ministry of&#13;
Education, Youth Affairs and Sports (MOE). Beyond its role in formulating education policy and&#13;
standards, it oversees operation of the school system, consistent with its mandate under a pre-&#13;
independence Education Ordinance.&#13;
2.14   Organizationally, the Ministry comprises seven sections: Administration (Personnel and&#13;
Accounts), Education, Sports, Library Services, Tertiary Education, Project Development and Youth&#13;
Affairs(Annex 2, Chart 2). The Administration Section is responsible for all financing and budgeting&#13;
activities of the sector. The Education Section is under the management of the Chief Education Officer&#13;
(CEO), assisted by a team of professional and support staff, including two Senior Education Officers&#13;
(Secondary and Teacher Training College}, an Education Officer (EO)/Coordinator for Curriculum, a&#13;
Coordinator for TechnicalVocational Education, six Assistant Education Officers who are subject&#13;
specialists (family life education, music, special education, physical education and arts and crafts) and&#13;
four District Education Officers (DEOs) responsible for overseeing primary school operations in their&#13;
4 Ihis is because the infants (ages 5 and 6) effectively go through a kindergarten and Grade I stage in the first two&#13;
years, but these are counted as two standards in Dominica.&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
assigned district--North, East, South and West. 5 Under the direct management of the CEO are a small&#13;
examinations unit, a statistics assistant, and a Stores and Supplies clerk.&#13;
2.15   The most serious obstacle to improvement in the sector lies in the weakness of the MOE Head&#13;
Office. The Ministry has offered a modicum of leadership to the school system only through the&#13;
dedicated work of a small number of persons. Supporting a reform will require significant strengthening&#13;
of the MOE staff at all levels. The various technical services of MOE (curriculum, statistics, testing etc.)&#13;
lack basic equipment and trained specialists and are grossly understaffed. Strengthening school&#13;
supervision to play an important role in leading the system towards reform and greater efficiency, will&#13;
require appropriately trained administrative and curriculum supervisors, and a rational and duly applied&#13;
system of annual evaluation of teachers and principals that encourages good performance. This will&#13;
require the elimination of anomalies such as the salary of the Senior Education Officer (secondary) being&#13;
graded below that of the secondary school principals that the SEO supervises. Inadequate education data&#13;
collection, processing and reporting, and feedback to the system has hampered the development of&#13;
planning functions. Financial and personnel management suffer similar weaknesses in terms of the level&#13;
of staff, training and equipment. Finally, overall, MOE is badly housed in the Governmental&#13;
Headquarters building, coping with serious shortage of office and storage space , and modern office&#13;
equipment.&#13;
2.16   The role played by the church in education in Dominica is significant. Although there are only&#13;
five assisted denominational primary schools, compared to 54 Government schools, these five account&#13;
for almost 20 percent of public school enrollment. At secondary level, however, there are eight assisted&#13;
denominational schools (compared to five Government schools) accounting for 47 percent of public&#13;
school enrollment.&#13;
5A fifth post of EO/Pre-school is sanctioned but has remained vacant&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. SECTOR ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
A. Issues&#13;
(1) Quality and Effectiveness of Teaching and Learning&#13;
3.1    Student Achievement. Educational testing to date has been conducted on a national basis only&#13;
in the form of terminal examinations of attainment or aptitude, with the results serving some screening&#13;
purpose for admission to the next level of education or, in the case of the CXC examination and some&#13;
craft and technician exams, for entry into jobs as well. Hence, no reliable indicators exist to measure the&#13;
quality of primary or secondary education within the respective cycle, either in individual schools or&#13;
across schools. There is no professionally designed test of achievement at the end of each grade and,&#13;
hence, no marker of an individual student's mastery of subject matter until the end of the cycle, when the&#13;
CEE selects students for available secondary places on the basis of their score. In addition, the absence&#13;
of a statistical unit and full time testing staff within the MOE, hampers the production of comparative&#13;
data of achievement across schools and years.&#13;
3.2    Student scores on the CEE suggest low overall achievement levels. CEE scores also indicate&#13;
wide disparities in student achievement and hence, most likely, in teaching and learning quality across&#13;
schools and districts. Review of the overall performance of candidates for the period 1989-1993, reveals&#13;
that girls are outperforming boys in all subjects on the CEE. The percentage of boys "passing" the CEE&#13;
is consistently below of the percentage of boys in the group that sat the examination, suggesting some&#13;
kind of under-achievement on the part of this gender group. (Annex 2, Table 2A)&#13;
3.3    As at the primary level, inadequate information exists to adequately assess the quality of&#13;
secondary education. Students with the highest scores on the CEE are assigned to available secondary&#13;
places. The relatively high secondary school completion rates belie the significant obstacles to learning&#13;
that most encounter, including a large proportion of untrained teachers and inadequate equipment and&#13;
supplies in key subject areas, such as the sciences, and the poor condition of some physical plant.&#13;
Roseau secondary schools enroll the highest CEE ranking students and tend to achieve the highest&#13;
average CXC score.&#13;
3.4    Like the CEE, the CXC, is an imperfect measure of student achievement or the overall quality of&#13;
education. Table 2 Annex 2B provides data on CXC subject passes in selected secondary schools for&#13;
1984 and 1992. Generally there has been a decline in pass rates, denoting low levels of student mastery&#13;
of cuITicula throughout the system. Significant inter-school differentials exist in student achievement&#13;
and, thus, possibly in education quality. One Roseau school, for example, although showing a decline in&#13;
passing rates over the period, displayed the lowest fall in rates, submitted 61 percent more student per&#13;
course entries in 1992 compared to 1984, and performed well above the national average. While pre-&#13;
selection of students through the CEE must be a factor in the superior performance, there is also the&#13;
advantage of a larger supply of university trained teachers at that school and of better provisions of&#13;
supplies and materials.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.5    An important equity issue in Dominica concerns the provision for education of the population&#13;
residing in the poorer sections of the island. Small rural schools are often at disadvantage coping with&#13;
the system-wide weak provision of trained teachers and supplies . A case in question is that of the&#13;
minority Carib population. The Caribs (about 3,000 people) reside largely in the reserved territory in the&#13;
North-East of the country. The four primary schools serving this territory (Atkinson, Salybia, Sineku,&#13;
and Concord) suffer from a shortage of trained teachers and a particularly deficient supply of materials&#13;
and books, accentuated by the absence of parental means to purchase books. Thus, the schools are ill-&#13;
equipped to deliver a primary program that would allow Carib children to compete on equal terms with&#13;
their fellow students for secondary school places. In 1994 a total of 79 children from the Carib area sat&#13;
the CEE and only 9 (II percent) were able to enter the secondary program, compared to 48 percent&#13;
nation-wide.&#13;
3.6    Factors Contributing to Low Achievement.    No systematic analysis has been undertaken of&#13;
the causes of low student performance in many schools. Existing information, however, suggests several&#13;
key contributing factors. These include: (a) quantitative and qualitative problems with regard to major&#13;
education system inputs, particularly the teaching cadre, educational equipment and supplies, and&#13;
facilities; (b) inadequate supervision of instructional delivery by school supervisors and principals;&#13;
(c) poor articulation of curricula and educational standards within and between grades; (d) distortion of&#13;
the primary curriculum by the pressure of competition for secondary school places; and (e) weak&#13;
institutional capacity to plan, manage or monitor performance of a system that will respond to the needs&#13;
of students of wide ability ranges.&#13;
3.7    Teacher Qualifications. Project preparatory studies have highlighted a state of crisis with regard&#13;
to the quality of teachers and teaching throughout basic education. High proportions of unqualified&#13;
teachers are engaged in the system--only 37 percent at primary level are trained. At secondary level,&#13;
only 28 percent of the teachers have university degrees and many of these (62 percent) have not been&#13;
professionally trained. The situation is particularly critical at the primary level, adversely affecting&#13;
teaching and learning in the core subjects--English, mathematics, social studies and sciences.&#13;
3.8    The TTC has ten full-time teacher trainers for the compulsory subjects, and six part-time trainers&#13;
for the optional courses. Of the full-time staff, four hold a Master's degree, while the other six have&#13;
completed a Bachelor's degree program. All of them need to be trained in the training of teachers. The&#13;
science and language laboratories of the Department are short of equipment and supplies, and the library&#13;
is short of audio-visual aids and reading materials for both the trainees and the tutors. The TTC program&#13;
is a two year one. Trainees spend roughly four of the six school terms within the college; the last two&#13;
terms are spent in practice teaching in the schools after which the trainees return to the TTC for a few&#13;
weeks to review the work they have done and take the final examinations.&#13;
3.9    The conclusion of observers within the system is that the performance of the bulk of trained&#13;
teachers, in terms of their mastery of content and method, is barely distinguishable from that of untrained&#13;
teachers. Several factors, other than the difficult conditions under which the college operates, contribute&#13;
to such a poor outcome:&#13;
(a)    the UWI curricular requirements that are not well related to realities in the schools, with&#13;
too much emphasis placed on research;&#13;
(b)    the inability of the Ministry (for whom the teachers are being trained) to influence&#13;
program content, and&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(c)   the insufficiency of supervised practice teaching in the training program.&#13;
3.10   Throughout the system, teacher performance is also adversely affected by poor working&#13;
conditions. The lack of basic educational materials and equipment to complement and support classroom&#13;
teaching and learning, and of minimum physical plant requirements, including electricity, water and&#13;
sanitation facilities, constitutes an obstacle to efficient performance. In some schools, especially the&#13;
most disadvantaged ones in terns of resources, teacher absenteeism and attrition rates are marked, the&#13;
latter particularly problematic among many younger, better qualified teachers who have employment&#13;
alternatives. Partly because of low morale, teachers are said to resort excessively to taking sick leave&#13;
and traditionally many of them take a day off--in effect a self-given paid holiday-- on pay-day at the end&#13;
of the month to settle their bills.&#13;
3.11   In Dominica, as elsewhere in the OECS, most candidates for primary teacher training are drawn&#13;
from the teaching service, that is from among those already employed by the MOE. The generally low&#13;
academic qualifications for entry into the system limit the number of candidates who can easily master&#13;
the curriculum of the TTC. The average trainee barely attains the passing grade in the final examination&#13;
of the teacher training program; thus, the comparatively high unit cost of teacher training has limited&#13;
payoff, in fact perpetuating a vicious cycle of low achievement among primary school students, because&#13;
in part, they are being taught by many teachers who, even when trained, have limited attainment&#13;
themselves. Finally, teacher training problems are compounded by the limited outreach of the teacher&#13;
trainers and the limited availability of in-service training programs for the trained teachers upon their&#13;
return to the education system&#13;
3.12   More rigorous teacher training program admission requirements, such as at least four CXC&#13;
passes, including English and Mathematics, are needed. Complementary steps will need to be taken to&#13;
raise the entry level for recruitment into the teaching profession, and establish some greater MOE&#13;
influence (as employer) over the training program.&#13;
3.13   Perfornance Evaluation.     Educational research has shown that the quality of education is&#13;
highly correlated with the intensity of supervision and monitoring and feedback in the system. In&#13;
recognition of this, Dominica is preparing measures to strengthen performance monitoring of the public&#13;
servants generally. For example, a new reporting form has recently been introduced. The institution of&#13;
regular, system-wide school performance review is necessary. Although some performance evaluations&#13;
of teachers and principals are conducted, allowing, in theory, for follow-up action in case the teachers in&#13;
question did not improve their performance, in practice, the system does not carry much weight and it is&#13;
not rigorously applied.&#13;
3.14   Curricula.    The Curriculum Unit is charged with developing curricula, teaching materials,&#13;
and tests. The Unit is seriously understaffed for its functions and responsibilities, and has no technical&#13;
expertise in production and publishing of educational materials and design of tests. The staff comprises&#13;
one EO, an Assistant EO, and a secretary. The lack of modern equipment and functional office space&#13;
hampers the efforts of the unit. With the exception of science at secondary level, none of the other&#13;
syllabi has been fully developed and implemented. Trained curriculum specialists are needed in each of&#13;
the core curricular areas--science, social studies, mathematics and English.&#13;
3.15   In Dominica, as in other OECS countries, teaching tends to focus on basic facts with limited&#13;
attention given to developing critical thinking skills or fostering student research and investigation, even&#13;
in such subjects as science. Expert analysis has indicated that particular attention should be paid to the&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
language arts policy, especially to the potential in the primary school years to build bridges between&#13;
English, the official language of Dominica, and the French and English creoles most commonly spoken&#13;
by the students.&#13;
3.16   Curricula at both the primary and secondary levels have become overloaded. In an attempt to&#13;
respond to demands for more diversified courses, particularly in the technical and vocational areas,&#13;
subjects have been added in an ad hoc manner, without adequate attention to their cost implications or&#13;
the integrity of the whole curriculum. As a result, primary schools are insufficiently focused on the&#13;
basic, core subjects. The curriculum needs to be coordinated between levels and consolidated to avoid&#13;
the tendency towards proliferation of subjects and the consequent high cost of covering a too fragmented&#13;
curriculum, particularly at secondary level.&#13;
3.17   Educational Materials. MOE has prepared a list of approved school text books which are&#13;
produced by the major British publishers. Published prices for books are fixed by these publishers in the&#13;
United Kingdom, with annual price increases that often exceed the local inflation rate without any real&#13;
control by the MOE or the local booksellers. There is also no control on the mark-up on textbooks and&#13;
other imported books, although indications are that it is set at an average of 25 percent over the&#13;
published price. The burden posed by the cost of textbooks on families is heavy. Although the recent&#13;
standardization of basic textbooks and the sale and purchase of used ones helped to alleviate the pressure&#13;
on family budgets, in some primary schools in the outlying areas the majority of pupils do not have all&#13;
the books required. This problem is particularly acute in the schools of the Carib territory where it is&#13;
exceptional for children to have any books. In the secondary schools the situation is less severe as a&#13;
result of the Government grant of scholarships and bursaries to about 900 students, amounting to&#13;
approximately US$175,000 equivalent per year.&#13;
3.18   The Government, has indicated its desire to provide free text books in all primary and secondary&#13;
schools. In view of the current fiscal constraints, this proposal requires careful analysis of the scope of&#13;
coverage intended ( range of subjects, grade levels, number of books per student) and the management&#13;
arrangements--accounting, distribution, and financial--required under various options that might be&#13;
entertained. A study of the issue will be required in order to fully assess the intended scale and nature of&#13;
the textbook supply mechanism that could be successfully applied to Dominica. The management,&#13;
institutional, and logistical arrangements required by a subsidy scheme should be carefully weighed,&#13;
together with the associated costs.&#13;
3.19   Supplementary reading materials and various forms of teaching apparatus are urgently needed to&#13;
support teachers in the early grades, if standards of student and teacher performance are to be raised.&#13;
Expert review suggests that it would be feasible to establish a nucleus of a unit for preparing and&#13;
producing such materials to supplement what can be purchased in the stores, to determine Government's&#13;
procurement policy on such materials, and to contribute to any sub-regional effort in production of such&#13;
materials, especially at primary level.&#13;
3.20   To fulfill its significant potential to produce supportive educational materials, particularly at the&#13;
primary level, and thus contribute to desired improvements in the quality of education, MOE requires: (i)&#13;
technical staff capacity in educational materials editing and publishing, which will assist the Ministry to&#13;
become more market-wise in its contracting processes; (ii) furniture, equipment and supplies to permit to&#13;
desk top publishing, as appropriate, as well as advance the publishing readiness of material it produces,&#13;
thereby reducing costs of external publication and manufacturing; (iii) improved methods of selection of&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
textbooks from the broad choices available on the international market which are responsive to the CXC&#13;
syllabi.&#13;
3.21   Testing and Measurement.    MOE designs and administers the CEE and the JSPE, and&#13;
administers the external examinations (i.e. CGE, CXC). The Curriculum Unit is charged with the CEE,&#13;
the Technical-Vocational officer with the JSPE, and the Examinations Unit with the administration of&#13;
the CXC and CGE. The CEE is designed by a committee within MOE on the basis of the content of&#13;
primary school syllabi. The tests are printed and scored entirely in Dominica. A team of teachers marks&#13;
the scripts and the marks are processed in the Government Computer Center. The need exists for a&#13;
professionally designed testing system to improve the CEE and to expand the testing program to include&#13;
at least one national test within the primary cycle (about two years before the CEE) and one within the&#13;
secondary cycle (at Form 3 level), thus facilitating the diagnosis of learning and teaching problems in&#13;
time to take corrective measures.&#13;
3.22   Schools Library Service.   The Public Library Service in Dominica is under the direction of&#13;
MOE. Aware of the poor reading situation, especially in rural areas, the government instituted the&#13;
School Library Extension Scheme (SLS) to serve the schools, beginning with the primary schools. The&#13;
SLS provides technical assistance to the schools in the establishment of varying types of book&#13;
collections and training of teachers in the management of the materials. To date 16 primary schools&#13;
have been assisted through this program. Services are also offered to 19 rural schools by the single&#13;
Mobile Library Unit which visits the schools on a two week circuit offering loan services to the&#13;
students.&#13;
3.23   SUpplieS.    The Stores Clerk, who reports directly to the CEO, places catalog bulk orders for&#13;
basic supplies for all public primary schools during the month of July. The supplies are then stored in a&#13;
rented building and delivered to the schools twice a year at the beginning of a new term, depending on&#13;
the availability of the truck owned by MOE. Only one percent of the recurrent budget for education is&#13;
spent in supplies, clearly not satisfying the pressing needs of the schools. Each Government secondary&#13;
school has its own provision for supplies in the budget estimates but the release of these funds must be&#13;
approved by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The supply of materials to the schools on a regular basis is&#13;
needed in order to provide a more suitable learning and teaching environment; however, under the&#13;
present stringent fiscal situation, the funding should come from a gradual reallocation of sector budget&#13;
resources.&#13;
3.24   State of Physical Plant. The current state of much of the physical plant is not conducive to&#13;
adequate teaching or learning. Many primary schools were constructed in the l 970s when, with&#13;
substantial assistance from the Canadian Government, the country embarked on a major education&#13;
expansion program. The two decades that have since passed, with minimal maintenance or repair of&#13;
facilities, have taken their toll. Deterioration is widespread, with half of all schools in need of repair or&#13;
renovation with regard to plumbing, roofing, ceilings, electrical wiring, corrosion of metal frames and&#13;
columns (exacerbated by constant sea blast), drainage, lighting and fencing. Many lack working toilets.&#13;
3.25   School maintenance jobs are contracted out to private firms, under the oversight of the MOE's&#13;
maintenance unit, which includes a Project Supervisor and two regional maintenance officers, one for the&#13;
Southem and Eastem and one for the Northem and Westem education districts. In actuality, the limited&#13;
budgetary allocation to maintenance, coupled with limitations on the monthly travel allowance permnitted&#13;
for these maintenance officers, severely circumscribes preventive as well as repair-oriented maintenance&#13;
of plant.&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(2) Efficiency of the Educational System&#13;
3.26   Current teacher to student ratios in public schools are 1:21.6 at the primary level and 1:16.6 at&#13;
the secondary level. The primary ratio exceeds the reasonable Government prescribed standard of 1:35.&#13;
At the secondary level, in schools without a sixth Form, a ratio of 1:25 would be more appropriate. The&#13;
relatively high existing ratios reflect the absence of close monitoring of costs and efficiency and the lack&#13;
of detailed planning and programming in regard to school enrollments and the recruitment and&#13;
deployment of teachers.&#13;
3.27   High teacher to student ratios have exacted a heavy financial as well as qualitative toll on the&#13;
education system. The high proportion of the recurrent education budget expended on salary and other&#13;
personal emoluments (representing about 97 percent of recurrent allocations to primary schools in&#13;
1993/94), seriously constrains resource availability for other key educational inputs, particularly&#13;
improved management, educational equipment and supplies, and the maintenance of school plant and&#13;
equipment. Extensive research has shown that, except at the extremes, lower teacher to student ratios do&#13;
not adversely affect either the quality of education provided or the levels of learning and achievement.&#13;
3.28   The implications of the proposed reductions in teacher to student ratios are significant. At the&#13;
primary level, there will be a continuing decline in enrollments over the next few years, reflecting&#13;
demographic change. Consequently the demand for teachers will decline. Special measures will,&#13;
therefore, need to be carefully programmed to cope with the reduced demand for primary school places.&#13;
At the very least, there will be a need to reduce sharply the recruitment of new teachers over a period of&#13;
about five years, to transfer some primary teachers to the secondary level, and to adopt revised strategies&#13;
for teacher training, focusing on attaining a 100 percent trained service and improving educational&#13;
standards.&#13;
3.29   On the other hand, the implications of not effecting these changes to the ratios are serious. In&#13;
their absence, either qualitative improvements such as those to be supported under the Basic Education&#13;
Reform Project will not be able to be financed, or the Government will have to raise the education sector&#13;
share of the national budget, which is highly unlikely given current and projected fiscal constraints&#13;
associated with the banana crisis.&#13;
(3) Equity of Access to Educational Opportunities&#13;
3.30   Significant gender inequalities in access to education exist in Dominica, as elsewhere in the&#13;
OECS. Of increasing social concern are the gender differentials in student achievement, commencing at&#13;
the primary level, with girls outperforming boys on the CEE and subsequently at the CXC (Annex 2,&#13;
Tables 2A, 2B). On the basis of the CEE raw scores used to select students for secondary places, girls&#13;
are securing the predominant share of such places, comprising 57.8 percent of public secondary&#13;
enrollment in 1994/95. Neither the underlying causes nor the long term consequences of this&#13;
phenomenon are known, but the potential negative ramifications for economic and social development&#13;
warrant careful study.&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.31   Poorer families face special geographic constraints to access to good quality education. The&#13;
heavy concentration of secondary schools in Roseau limits their availability to many poor, rural families.&#13;
At the same time, the weak CEE performance of many students attending schools outside Roseau&#13;
restricts their access to secondary education.&#13;
3.32   While public education is provided free, with no official Government imposed tuition fee, other&#13;
annual education-related expenditures which must be borne by the household can be considerable. These&#13;
include uniforms, school bus transport, which can average over US$400 equivalent per student per&#13;
academic year; textbooks and other educational materials which outlays have been estimated to range&#13;
from around US$100 per student at the primary level to US$370 equivalent at the secondary level; and&#13;
various levies imposed by individual secondary schools.&#13;
B. Government Sectoral Policy and Financing&#13;
3.33   Education Polcy.     National development policy for the education sector has been&#13;
elaborated in various documents. The most recent one, the Government's Medium-Term Strategy Paper&#13;
of April 1994, consistent with the OECS Education Reform Strategy, emphasizes the provision of skills&#13;
to the labor force to increase labor productivity and facilitate economic diversification. To achieve these&#13;
results, "higher" priorities are given to organization and management concerns of the sector ministry as&#13;
well as to increase the ratio of expenditures on supplies and equipment in education budgets. The&#13;
primary and secondary school curricula will be revised, and made more uniform throughout the system.&#13;
More classroom places will be made available at the seconidary school level, giving priority to expanding&#13;
existing high perfortning schools". The Paper mentions also the need to increase the average primary&#13;
student to teacher ratio to at least 30:1.&#13;
3.34   The new Government that came into power in June 1995 is developing its sector policy.&#13;
However, it has indicated support for the priorities inherent in the project: expanding access to school&#13;
places, improving the quality of sector management and of teaching, and improving the supply of&#13;
materials and maintenance services to the schools.&#13;
3.35   Notwithstanding the political commitment to sector reform, it will be necessary to undertake&#13;
institutional and policy reforms to attain desired improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of the&#13;
system, and enhance equity of access to educational opportunities and, ultimately, learning outcomes.&#13;
The current weakness in the administration of the sector suggests the need to increase the number of&#13;
senior level staff, to establish a permanent capacity for the conduct of sector planning, efficiency studies,&#13;
and implementation of project and program, and to establish discrete units for curriculum development,&#13;
testing and measurement and education materials. Proposed changes in structure are shown in Annex 3,&#13;
Chart 3.&#13;
3.36   Sector Financing.    Annual outlays in education over the past five years have averaged&#13;
around 17 percent of total recurrent expenditures 6 while the sector provision in the 1994/5 Estimates&#13;
amounted to 17.1 percent of the national total (Annex 3, Tables I and 2). The share of the public budget&#13;
allocated to education is not likely to increase significantly over the near term. Thus, the Government&#13;
6 This does not include the subvention to the University of the West Indies--UWI&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
recognizes the need to assign high priority to improving the efficiency of use of education sector&#13;
resources.&#13;
3.37   Traditionally, approximately 60 percent of recurrent education expenditures was allocated to&#13;
primary, and 20 percent to secondary. However, since at least 1990/91 there have been modest&#13;
fluctuations in the allocations to secondary education, including a rise to about 28 percent of the&#13;
recurrent budget. This increase reflects in part the expansion of enrollment due to the expansion of&#13;
secondary places, with the phasing out of some technical-vocational programs at Goodwill and St.&#13;
Martin's schools. According to the 1994/95 Estimates the sub-sector shares of the sector budget&#13;
(including the contribution to UWI), were as follows:&#13;
Percent of&#13;
Sub-Sector                                Amount             Total&#13;

3.38   In the absence of a proper plan for the sector, it is impossible to forecast the evolution of these&#13;
intra-sectoral allocations. In the public financing of primary and secondary schools, the mix of salary&#13;
and non-salary allocations is grossly inefficient. Salaries consume 97 percent of total recurrent&#13;
allocations to primary schools and 95 percent of the allocations to secondary government schools.&#13;
3.39   Significant variations exist in the per student recurrent expenditure by level of education. Unit&#13;
costs in 1994/95 were US$419 equivalent per student at the primary level, and US$652 equivalent at the&#13;
secondary government level . Differences exist among Government secondary schools, ranging from&#13;
Dominica Grammar with US$709 equivalent per student to Goodwill with U$367 equivalent. Ironically,&#13;
the Assisted secondary schools, have generally a much higher per student cost financed by the&#13;
Government than the Government schools (Annex 3, Table 3B).&#13;
3.40   Capital investment on education represented about 7 percent of the Government's capital budget&#13;
in 1994/95, in line with the OECS regional average. The focus of past investment programs has been&#13;
rehabilitation or extension of primary and secondary schools.&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4. SECTORAL ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
A. The Bank's Role and Strategy&#13;
4.1   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the OECS countries, including Dominica (Report&#13;
No.14295-LAC dated April 10, 1995), falls within the parameters of the regional OECS assistance&#13;
strategy. The Bank continues to rely on the coordinating role of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in&#13;
Economic Development (CGCED) for the implementation of economic and sector work and financial&#13;
assistance in the region, and on close cooperation with the CDB. In recognition of the small size of the&#13;
OECS economies, the World Bank Group provides its lending on a 50/50 IDAfIBRD blend.&#13;
4.2   The Bank seeks to support the Government efforts aimed at: (i) accelerating private sector-led&#13;
economic diversification; (ii) restructuring the banana industry, improving competitiveness and&#13;
agriculture diversification (iii) restructuring the public sector to ensure sustained adequate levels of&#13;
public savings, while promoting greater regional collaboration; (iv) promoting human resource&#13;
development and poverty alleviation; and (v) sustaining natural resource management. To these ends, the&#13;
Bank is pursuing a three-pronged approach in Dominica, as elsewhere in the sub-region. First, through&#13;
the Economic and Sector Work (ESW), it is providing intellectual leadership, in collaboration with the&#13;
IMF and CDB, to strengthen the institutional capacity of the country to identify priority policies and&#13;
programs and effectively implement them. Second, the Bank is strengthening CDB capacity in human&#13;
resource development and environmental management, so that in full partnership with the Bank, it&#13;
increasingly can undertake ESW and lending in these key development areas, including the channeling of&#13;
increased Bank resources to these sectors through CDB. Third, the Bank is proactive in donor&#13;
coordination, including mobilizing the scarce external financing available to OECS countries, the main&#13;
forum for which coordination will continue to be the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic&#13;
Development (CGCED).&#13;
4.3   The proposed project supports fully the CAS targeting the priority area of human resource&#13;
development, catalyzing an education sector adjustment process to improve efficiency of public resource&#13;
use and providing a reform that is consistent with the regional efforts being adopted elsewhere in the&#13;
OECS sub-region. Through sector analysis carried out during the preparatory phase, the Bank has&#13;
sought to strengthen Dominica's institutional capacity to identify and implement priority development&#13;
policies and programs. To this end, with financial support from a grant from the Government of Japan,&#13;
multi-disciplinary teams comprising international consultants and a consulting firm, local consultants&#13;
and local counterparts, assessed in depth key issues within the education sector, and collaboratively&#13;
identified cost-effective approaches to address them.&#13;
4.4   The project is one segment in a larger program of assistance to the other four active Bank&#13;
member countries in the OECS -- St. Lucia, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and St. Kitts and&#13;
Nevis -- to meet their human resource development needs. A Loan and a Credit were approved in&#13;
January 1995 for a Basic Education Reform Project (3837 SLU; CR2676 SLU) in St. Lucia which is&#13;
jointly financed by the Bank and CDB. In order to expedite subsequent lending operations it was agreed&#13;
between the two Banks that CDB would focus on St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the&#13;
Grenadines, and the IBRD/IDA on the remaining two, Dominica and Grenada.&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.5    To further promote regional collaboration, project preparatory work has drawn heavily on&#13;
Caribbean technical expertise. The use of a common core of consultants across the OECS countries has&#13;
promoted exchange of ideas between countries. Moreover, such project preparation has been carried out&#13;
in close consultation with the OECS Secretariat, building on its extensive work to formulate and&#13;
implement an OECS Education Reform Strategy (OERS), to which the OECS Governments are&#13;
committed. The project emphasis on sector planning and institutional development, qualitative&#13;
improvement of basic education, and expansion of access to education reflects the priority actions&#13;
identified in the OERS.&#13;
4.6          The OERS envisages activities at both the national and regional level. Unexpected&#13;
delays occurred in establishment of the regional machinery. However, at their meeting in Montserrat in&#13;
November 1993, the OECS Governments agreed that the national governments should proceed with their&#13;
own urgently needed education investment programs, consistent with the Reform objectives. This&#13;
project is in keeping with that decision. The proposed investments also are consistent with priority&#13;
sector development needs identified in the Bank report, "Access, Quality and Efficiency in Caribbean&#13;
Education: A Regional Study," prepared at the request of member governments in the Caribbean,&#13;
discussed widely in the region, and formally presented at the June 1992 meeting of the Caribbean Group&#13;
for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED), and the request emanating from that CGCED&#13;
meeting for direct Bank technical and financial support to accelerate human resource development in this&#13;
region.&#13;
B. Bank Sector Experience and Lessons Learned&#13;
4.7    The Bank has had limited sector experience in Dominica and other OECS countries. Prior to the&#13;
St. Lucia project noted above (para 4.4), its only sector involvement was in support of the OECS&#13;
Regional Vocational and Technical Education Project, Credit 1785-CRG, in the amount of SDR 4.8&#13;
million (US$ 6.5 million equivalent) with a total project cost of US$ 13.5 million equivalent, co-financed&#13;
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the CDB, the latter of which also served as&#13;
project executing agency. The Credit was approved by the Board in 1987, became effective in 1987, and&#13;
the Credit was closed on June 30, 1994. While national coordinators were appointed by each of the five&#13;
participating OECS Governments, the locus of project implementation work was at CDB in Barbados.&#13;
Consequently, the OECS Governments, including Dominica, did not gain experience with Bank-financed&#13;
project execution, procurement, disbursement, and other procedures&#13;
4.8    An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) was prepared for the Regional Vocational and&#13;
7&#13;
Technical Education Project.  Review to date indicates that the overall performance of the project was&#13;
mixed. Notable achievements include a substantial increase in technical and vocational education&#13;
capacity in the participating countries. Project investments also led to extensive overseas training of&#13;
technical and vocational teachers for the respective education systems. The pre-vocational curricula&#13;
developed under project auspices, though developed only for the first year of study and introduced too&#13;
late during the project implementation to be fully evaluated, holds promise of providing, with possible&#13;
adjustments, a solid orientation to technical fields.&#13;

15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.9    Notwithstanding actual and potential contributions, the OECS project also experienced&#13;
significant problems. Many of the civil works experienced substantial delays in start-up and completion&#13;
of construction, leading to price increases and creating the need for long-term storage of equipment and&#13;
furniture delivered according to the original implementation schedule; and pervasive lack of maintenance&#13;
of new and rehabilitated facilities led, in the latter cases in particular, to facilities being virtually&#13;
indistinguishable within two years of completion of such civil works from those without any&#13;
"renovation." Problems also arose with regard to the quality and quantity of procured instructional&#13;
equipment, and as a result of insufficient attention to its commissioning and utilization. Many of the&#13;
problems relating to safety and security of equipment and civil works ultimately were successfully&#13;
addressed via an Action Plan collaboratively developed and implemented by the Bank and CDB.&#13;
Shortfalls in execution of other major project activities nevertheless hampered the full achievement of&#13;
project objectives. For example, the project laid the groundwork for labor market information systems to&#13;
provide needed linkages and feedback between technical/vocational training and the labor market; and&#13;
three countries produced labor bulletins. However, the lack of direct project financing for this, as well as&#13;
other "soft," institutional development-oriented areas, coupled with shortages of staff at the country-&#13;
level, hampered actual establishment of the planned systems, and the conduct of annual labor surveys on&#13;
which they depend. Weak consultant reports, and insufficient Government commitment or incentives,&#13;
led to abandonment of envisaged cost recovery and savings measures intended to ensure program&#13;
sustainability. Attempts were made to establish the envisaged Regional Training Board to coordinate&#13;
tech/voc programs across the OECS, building on experience gained by the project in establishing several&#13;
National Boards; few regional meetings were held. However, insufficient commitment to such a Board,&#13;
and insufficient project resources to build the requisite policy constituency, ultimately undermined such&#13;
efforts.&#13;
4.10   Lessons Leaned.     Review of this OECS project, as well as of education projects in Jamaica&#13;
(Second and Third Education Projects, respectively Loan 727-JM and Loan 2070-JM), Barbados (First&#13;
Education and Training Project, Loan 1642-BAR), and Haiti (Third Education Project, Credit 1305-HA)&#13;
reveals that it is essential to: (a) link project objectives to the broader sector and macro policy objectives&#13;
to enhance overall commitment to, and hence success in execution of, the project; (b) carefully evaluate&#13;
local procurement and project implementation capacities to ensure that adequate and timely institutional&#13;
support is available for the smooth operation of the project; (c) ensure on an annual basis that&#13;
Government budgets provide the requisite project financing so that the planned pace and breadth of&#13;
project activities can be sustained, and the project completed according to schedule; (d) involve all major&#13;
stakeholders in an education reform process (i.e., the Ministry staff, principals, teachers and teachers&#13;
unions, and parents and community groups) from the early stages of project design; and (e) readily,&#13;
ensure that the policy environment within which the project will operate is supportive of project&#13;
objectives and enables conduct of the needed systemic and institutional reforms.&#13;
4.11   These lessons are taken into account in the proposed project design. The project objectives are&#13;
drawn from the recommendations of the OECS Education Reform Strategy paper, endorsed by all OECS&#13;
member governments, the Bank's report "Access, Quality and Efficiency in Caribbean Education: A&#13;
Regional Study" and experience gained during the preparation of the St. Lucia Basic Education Reform&#13;
Project. The preparatory phase included wide consultation with all major entities in the sector, including&#13;
the Teachers and civil service's unions, the teacher training college, private sector employers, the staff of&#13;
MOE. As civil works represent about 50 percent of total base costs, much attention was given in the&#13;
project preparatory phase to development of prototype designs which take into account local building&#13;
standards and experiences, and environmental (including climatic) and other factors. Emphasis also was&#13;
placed on preparation of preliminary drawings for all facilities to be financed under the project by a&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
respected international architectural firm with experience with Bank financed projects, to preclude the&#13;
significant civil works problems encountered under the earlier Vocational and Technical Education&#13;
Project in which excessive reliance was placed on the local Ministries of Public Works, which proved to&#13;
have limited institutional capacity to guide this process. The selection and methods for procurement of&#13;
educational equipment and furniture have been carefully assessed to ensure that detailed technical&#13;
specifications are developed with participation of end users, high quality-low cost sources are identified&#13;
and tapped, and comprehensive plans exist for operationalizing and pilot testing new equipment, and&#13;
training teachers in their appropriate use. All these measures should considerably reduce the risk of&#13;
repeating the serious problems in these areas encountered in the earlier OECS education project.&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Concept&#13;
5.1    The proposed Basic Education Reform Project responds to a request from the Government of&#13;
Dominica to assist it in initiating a reform of its education system. The decision to focus the project on&#13;
the basic, compulsory education cycle, and agreement on the scope of a possible project were reached&#13;
over the course of extensive dialogue over the 1993-1995 period between Government officials and Bank&#13;
staff. The actual project content was defined and the components prepared over the 1994-1995 period in&#13;
discussions between the Government and the Bank with assistance from consultants financed by Policy&#13;
and Human Resource Development funds from the Government of Japan.&#13;
5.2    The project has the overall objective of accelerating human resource development to ensure that&#13;
the requisite manpower exists to attain the desired economic transition in Dominica. It supports the first&#13;
stage of a major reforn of basic education, aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the&#13;
education system, and at enhancing equity of access to educational opportunities. Thus the project&#13;
would: (a) strengthen the planning and institutional capacity of the MOE to guide and carry out the long-&#13;
term development of the sector, while enabling it to initiate significant, urgent measures to address&#13;
system-wide qualitative problems and expansion needs at the secondary level, and (b) serve as a catalyst&#13;
for a major adjustment process, focused on revision to more reasonable levels of primary and secondary&#13;
teacher to student ratios, in line with ratios of countries of comparable economic and social development.&#13;
Such adjustment is critical to ensure that the relatively high levels of resource allocations to public&#13;
education respond more effectively to current and projected needs, including increased financing for&#13;
system management, instructional equipment and supplies, school facilities and equipment&#13;
maintenance--areas which are now significantly under-financed. The planned adjustment is crucial to&#13;
ensure the financial sustainability of the reform. An analysis of the impact of this adjustment is provided&#13;
in the Appendix to Annex 3.&#13;
5.3    The project is based on the Government's sector development policy. At Negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached on the general content of an Education Strategy Letter from the Government to&#13;
IBRD and IDA that would:&#13;
(a)    outline the Ministry's strategy for strengthening the management and planning of the&#13;
sector, including:&#13;
(i)    reorganization of the structure of the Ministry;&#13;
(ii)   the schedule of establishing new units with agreed functions and responsibilities,&#13;
and&#13;
(iii)    accelerated action on the EPU and PMU to create and staff them with&#13;
professionals with agreed qualifications;&#13;
(b)    indicate the government's plans with respect to the adjustment of teacher to student&#13;
ratios and the transfer of savings to strengthen management and the provision of&#13;
instructional supplies and maintenance services to schools. (Annex 3 Appendix).&#13;
(c)    elaborate the parallel policies that the Ministry would adopt to give full effect to the&#13;
reform, including:&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(i)    policies on the standards for recruitment into the teaching profession and the&#13;
teacher training programs;&#13;
(ii)    criteria and procedures for the selection of persons to be awarded fellowships,&#13;
and&#13;
(iii)   the conduct and utilization of studies financed under the project,&#13;
B. Detailed Project Description&#13;
5.4    The project comprises three major components:&#13;
(a)    A Strengthening Management and Planning Component would help to: (i) reorganize the&#13;
management of the school system, upgrade staff, and improve coordination among key&#13;
MOE operating units; (ii) build planning capacity and analysis and formulate a long-term&#13;
sector development plan; (iii) initiate development of an integrated education data&#13;
system to facilitate sector analysis, administration and management, and policy-making;&#13;
(iv) establish a permanent project development and management capacity within MOE;&#13;
and (v) finance special studies to assist in formulating future policies and program&#13;
developments.&#13;
(b)    A Qualitative Improvement of Basic Education Component would enhance the quality of&#13;
teaching and learning, through: (i) upgrading basic teacher training and revising and&#13;
intensifying in-service training for all teachers (with special attention to science,&#13;
mathematics, social studies, and language arts) and, concurrently, ensuring their more&#13;
appropriate utilization and job satisfaction through improved personnel supervision,&#13;
management and career development; (ii) formulating and adopting improved curricula&#13;
(especially in core subjects); (iii) establishing an educational testing and measurement&#13;
capacity to monitor student and system performance; (iv) identifying and instituting&#13;
more cost-effective methods of selection, production, procurement and distribution of&#13;
educational materials; and (v) providing support for the acquisition of textbook and&#13;
educational materials for the most disadvantaged schools (to include those serving the&#13;
Carib territory ). Further, this component would help strengthen the School Library&#13;
Service (SLS) by intensifying its activities in the northern area of Dominica.&#13;
(c)    An Expansion and Conservation of School Places Component would assist MOE to&#13;
provide more secondary school places in the most under-served districts to reduce long&#13;
distance travel and facilitate access to educational opportunities. The component would&#13;
also provide for the rehabilitation of selected primary and secondary schools and support&#13;
a new approach to systematic preventive maintenance and replacement of existing&#13;
school plant.&#13;
Strengthening Management and Planning Component&#13;
(US$1 million equivalent of base costs or 15 percent of total base costs)&#13;
5.5    The MOE needs to review its organization, procedures and functions with a view to&#13;
rationalizing the use of existing resources (human and financial) and improving its overall efficiency in&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
guiding the education system. As an urgent measure to facilitate improved education planning and&#13;
directly support project implementation, the MOE would establish an Educational Planning and&#13;
Development Section. The new section will comprise two units--an education planning and statistics&#13;
unit (EPU) and a project management unit (PMU). The proposed new organizational structure of the&#13;
MOE is provided in Annex 3, Chart 3.&#13;
5.6           Senior Management and Administration. The Government would establish two posts of&#13;
Assistant Chief Education Officer (ACEO), each to coordinate one aspect of the technical services of the&#13;
Ministry: one for planning and development, and the other for the school system. In order to strengthen&#13;
the administration, the Government would also establish two posts of executive Officer, one for&#13;
Accounting and the other for Personnel. The MOE will also add to its staff a Senior Education Officer&#13;
(SEO) to coordinate Primary Education. In order to assist the MOE (i) to better rationalize and utilize&#13;
sector resources; (ii) to identify and elaborate strategies to adapt, develop and modernize education&#13;
system administration consistent with the evolution of the sector, including revision, as appropriate, of its&#13;
laws and regulations; and (iii) to incorporate these strategies in the long term sector development plan,&#13;
the project would provide:&#13;
(a)    Expert services (4 months) to review the MOE management system and assist in the&#13;
implementation of reforms, as needed, to rationalize its administrative ,organization and&#13;
functions; to assess progress in its restructuring and provide recommendations for&#13;
improvements in its structure, staffing, procedures, etc.;&#13;
(b)    Study tours (4 months) for senior managers to review education reform processes in&#13;
other countries and attend relevant seminars and courses in such areas as effective&#13;
schools and education policy analysis;&#13;
(c)    Civil works for office space; s&#13;
(d)    Supplementary office equipment and supplies, to complement existing MOE equipment,&#13;
and literature and reference material for professional updating on educational&#13;
developments worldwide;9 and,&#13;
(e)    Selected studies on organizational and expenditure efficiency&#13;
5.7    Sector Planning.      To meet the challenges presented by the education reform process,&#13;
facilitate introduction of timely adjustments to the system, and foster closer interaction of education&#13;
systems across the OECS, the project would assist in establishing a properly staffed EPU of the MOE&#13;
responsible for planning ,statistics and research. The first tasks of EPU would include the preparation of&#13;
a long-term sector development plan for the period 1996-2005, the establishment and maintenance of a&#13;
data base concerning economic and social data for the sector, and the conduct of studies relating to the&#13;
efficiency of the sector.&#13;
vConstruction of office space for all new and for some existing units on the grounds of the Teacher Training&#13;
College. Office space requirements for the various units are detailed in Annex 5, Table 1.&#13;
Relevant literature and reading materials needed for all institutional strengthening and quality improvement&#13;
components are included under this area of project support. These materials would be consigned to the MOE&#13;
Documentation Center for optimal organizing and accessibility.&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
To these ends, the project would finance:&#13;
(a)    Fellowships (3 staff years) for three persons to pursue one-year advanced training, one in&#13;
educational planning, one in statistics and one in the economics of education, financial&#13;
analysis and operations research.&#13;
(b)    Expert services (4 months, concentrated in the first two years of project implementation)&#13;
to assist the EPU to identify and analyze key sub-sectoral and sectoral issues, establish&#13;
approaches to long range planning and lay the groundwork for the long-term sector plan;&#13;
(c)    Related office furniture, equipment and supplies, computers, related software and&#13;
printers, and equipment maintenance;&#13;
(d)    Local training't for staff in planning and statistics, and&#13;
(e)    Selected planning and policy related studies and surveys, including expenditure&#13;
efficiency and cost effectiveness in the sector.&#13;
5.8    Planning and policy-related studies and surveys would be carried out under the overall&#13;
coordination of the EPU, and would include, for the first two years of project implementation, studies&#13;
on: education and training implications of macro-economic and social development and labor market&#13;
demands (including the relationship of curricular trends to the requirements of higher education and the&#13;
labor market); teacher effectiveness and teacher attrition; and studies to support the analytical work of&#13;
other units. Studies for the third through fifth years of project implementation would be identified and&#13;
specified in the annual project work program, to be approved by IBRD/IDA.&#13;
5.9    Project Management and Development. A PMU would be established and maintained, with&#13;
functions and responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank and the Association, for the purpose of inter alia:&#13;
(a) coordination of project implementation; (b) project monitoring and evaluation; (c) preparation of the&#13;
requisite annual and mid-term project reports ;and (d) implementation of the MOE development&#13;
program. The PMU would absorb the existing Stores and Supplies and Maintenance units and would be&#13;
headed by a full-time Project Manager, assisted by two other full-time professional staff, a Procurement&#13;
Officer to oversee procurement, and an accountant to manage project accounts, and by clerical staff. The&#13;
administrative and operating procedures to be adopted for execution of the Basic Education Reform&#13;
Project would become, to the extent possible, the modus operandi of the MOE in the procurement of&#13;
goods and works, so far as these do not conflict with Government procedures. The Government has&#13;
agreed that the PMU will become part of the regular establishment of MOE for the implementation of&#13;
sector development projects, programs, and plans.&#13;
5.10   To support strengthened project management and development objectives, the project would&#13;
finance:&#13;
(a)    Five months of study tours, seminars or attachments for key PMU staff to gain&#13;
experience and skills in areas relevant to their responsibilities in the Unit, such as review&#13;
of operations of Education Project Management Units elsewhere in the Caribbean (e.g.&#13;
10 In general, where local training is to be financed under the project, eligible expenditures would include fees or&#13;
honoraria for tutors/trainers where necessary, travel and any necessary per diem allowance, cost of preparing&#13;
producing and procuring training materials and supplies and related transport costs.&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad &amp; Tobago), and/or to attend World Bank or CDB&#13;
seminars on topics such as disbursements, project accounting and procurement, and for&#13;
short-term attachment of the Procurement Officer to a suitable procurement agency for&#13;
training purposes;&#13;
(b)    Expert services (8 months) comprising 6 months of services of a Project Management&#13;
Expert to assist in project coordination and in setting up the PMU and establishing its&#13;
procedures and 2 months of services of a Procurement Expert to assist the PMU team at&#13;
critical points in the procurement process, and a lump-sum to help complete the auditing&#13;
requirements of the Project;&#13;
(c)    Related office furniture, equipment and supplies, including computers, related software,&#13;
printers, photocopier, etc., a van and a truck under the control of PMU to serve the&#13;
maintenance and procurement services, and equipment maintenance; and&#13;
(d)    Selected project evaluation studies.&#13;
Qualitative Improvement of Basic Education Component (US$2.5 million equivalent of base costs, or&#13;
36 percent of total base costs)&#13;
5.11   The generally poor quality of primary education constrains many students from fully benefiting&#13;
from a secondary education program, even when it is available to them. Hence, along with expanding&#13;
access to secondary schools, thus increasing educational opportunities, the project assigns high priority&#13;
to improving the quality of primary education, particularly in the core subject areas. This component,&#13;
encompassing improvement of major educational inputs--teachers, curricula, educational materials,&#13;
testing and measurement, and supervision--is expected to lead to significant improvements in educational&#13;
outcome in terms of learning and student achievement.&#13;
5.12   To contribute to the objective of enhancing educational quality and to provide a basis for more&#13;
effective participation of Dominica in the OECS Education Reform Strategy initiative, the project will&#13;
support six closely integrated and inter-dependent areas, (i) School supervision, (ii) Educational Testing&#13;
Measurement, (iii) Educational Materials Development, (iv) Curriculum Development, (v) Teacher&#13;
Training, and (vi) the Schools Library Service.&#13;
5.13   School Supervision.   The project seeks to strengthen the capacity of the school supervisory&#13;
service to supervise and guide secondary schools and to better monitor and assist primary and&#13;
secondary schools in such key areas as: (a) performance assessment of teachers, principals and schools,&#13;
(b) in-service training and orientation of teachers and principals in school management concepts and&#13;
effective school operations and, (c) efficient use of school resources, teachers, funding, and physical&#13;
plant. The project would also provide for the establishment of a new District Education Office (DEO) in&#13;
Castle Bruce to provide office space for use by the EO and for visiting MOE and TTC staff, a library for&#13;
teachers and education staff, and a lecture room for seminars, workshops and meetings to serve teachers&#13;
and principals. To support these objectives, the project would provide:&#13;
(a)    Fellowships (2 staff years) for two persons to pursue advanced one-year training&#13;
programs in school supervision, with particular attention to training in methods of&#13;
promoting school effectiveness, coupled with brief attachments to relevant external&#13;
agencies;&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)    Civil works for office space at the head office and construction of the DEO Office in&#13;
Castle Bruce;&#13;
(c)    Related furniture, equipment and supplies, including computers and software, for the&#13;
headquarters school supervisory service and for the new DEO Office, and&#13;
(d)   local on-the-job training courses for supervisors and principals to keep them abreast of&#13;
system developments and reforms in planning, curriculum, testing, educational materials&#13;
and teacher training, thereby helping to build the requisite support system for the reform&#13;
process.&#13;
5.14   Educational Testing and Measurement. To expand and strengthen the current testing program of&#13;
MOE, an Educational Testing and Examinations (ETX) Unit would be established. The Unit would:&#13;
(a) be responsible, as at present, for the administration of the Common Entrance examination (CEE)&#13;
and the JSP examination, and administration of external examinations, such as the CXC and the GCE;&#13;
(b) improve the CEE and expand the testing program to include, at least, one national test within the&#13;
primary cycle (about two years before the CEE) and one within the secondary cycle (at Form three&#13;
level) to better measure student and school performance; (c) develop national norms and desired&#13;
achievement standards; and (d) conduct research on student achievement and learning.&#13;
5.15   To directly support the new ETX Unit, the project would provide:&#13;
(a)    Fellowships (2 staff years) for two persons to pursue one-year advanced training&#13;
programs in Educational Testing and Measurement. A suitable short-term attachment&#13;
subsequent to training (possibly at the Caribbean Examinations Council--CXC) would be&#13;
arranged for the fellowship holders.&#13;
(b)    Expert services (4 months) to assist in establishing the ETX Unit and in the design of the&#13;
testing program;&#13;
(c)    Office furniture, equipment and supplies for data analysis, word processing, scoring&#13;
(including optical scanning), desktop publishing, and a van to be shared with the&#13;
Educational Materials Unit;&#13;
(d)    Funding for studies, including pilot testing of new tests, establishment of norms and&#13;
standards of achievement and for school evaluation (including school-based continuous&#13;
assessment), development of curriculum evaluation methodologies, and studies of&#13;
learning                   differentials among students, and&#13;
(e)   local on-the-job training, including item writing workshops as well as&#13;
orientation seminars for principals and teachers in the interpretation and constructive use&#13;
of test scores.&#13;
5.16   The civil works to accommodate the ETX unit will include the construction of a walk-in vault to&#13;
enhance the security of tests and examination. The ETX would absorb the existing office of the&#13;
Registrar of Examinations which would be strengthened by the addition of an Assistant Registrar.&#13;
5.17   Educational Materials Development.  The project would also strengthen the capacity of MOE&#13;
to prepare, produce and procure educational materials. With expert assistance, MOE would review cost-&#13;
23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
effective options regarding preparation, publication, manufacturing and distribution of supporting&#13;
materials and eventually textbooks, with a view to maximizing local (including private sector)&#13;
participation in these processes, as appropriate. MOE would also adopt improved methods of textbook&#13;
selection, standardizing and streamlining the number of textbooks per subject, to the extent feasible, as&#13;
well as exploring additional measures to ease the financial burden of textbook purchase on parents. To&#13;
expand access to text books by students of the most disadvantaged schools, and to provide teachers at&#13;
primary and secondary level with text book supplies, the project would finance:&#13;
(a)    The supply of a set of books in the core subjects from a list, to be agreed with the Bank&#13;
and the Association, of not more than ten of the most disadvantaged primary schools (as&#13;
measured by CEE performance) including the four Carib territory schools; and for&#13;
selected small schools, where multigrade teaching would be necessary in the light of the&#13;
proposed changes in teacher to student ratios;&#13;
(b)    The provision of basic text books for teachers of the grades 1-9, in each primary and&#13;
secondary school, and&#13;
(c)    The supply of supplementary educational materials for selected secondary schools,&#13;
especially to support the teaching of scientific subjects on the basis of a list of schools&#13;
and equipment to be agreed with the Bank.&#13;
5. i 8 The project would specifically provide:&#13;
(a)    Fellowships (2 staff years) for two persons holding degrees to pursue one year program&#13;
of advanced training, one in general editing and publishing and the other in art editing&#13;
and publishing, including in each case, subsequent attachment to an appropriate&#13;
publishing house;&#13;
(b)    Expert services (4 months) for two specialists as follows: (i) 2 months of assistance to&#13;
help the MOE to reshape, as appropriate, its policy and role in regard to preparing,&#13;
publishing and distributing educational materials and to evaluate and adopt, as&#13;
appropriate, alternative methods of procuring materials, and (ii) 2 months of assistance&#13;
to advise on educational materials production and desktop publishing. Both experts&#13;
would train local staff in publishing and production tasks;&#13;
(c)    Office furniture, equipment and supplies to support expanded and improved manuscript&#13;
development, word processing and desk top publishing, etc., and equipment&#13;
maintenance;&#13;
(d)    Local training workshops for writers and illustrators; and&#13;
(e)    Studies on the impact of books and materials on student performance and evaluation of&#13;
procurement methods for books.&#13;
5.19   Curriculum Development.    To provide the requisite technical expertise to&#13;
continually review curricula and syllabi, with particular attention to the core subjects--mathematics,&#13;
24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
language arts, social studies and science and to streamline the curricula, the project would strengthen the&#13;
Curriculum Development Unit (CDU), by financing:&#13;
(a)    Fellowships (4 staff years) for four persons to pursue one-year advanced level training&#13;
programs in the design, research and evaluation of curricula, one recipient in each of the&#13;
four core subject areas;&#13;
(b)    Supplementary furniture, equipment and supplies, including computers, software, data&#13;
storage equipment, printers for CDU and equipment maintenance;&#13;
(c)    Local training, via workshops for teachers, principals and supervisors to be conducted&#13;
by the returned fellows;&#13;
(d)    Studies for the evaluation of the syllabi and curricula and the articulation of them&#13;
between grades and cycles, and&#13;
(e)    (i) a science kit, (ii) a mathematics kit, and (iii) a social studies kit for each of 50&#13;
primary schools, and related storage units for this equipment, to support improved&#13;
teaching of syllabi at the school level;&#13;
5.20   Teacher Training.    This sub-component seeks to improve teacher training at the basic and&#13;
in-service levels and, thus, contribute to improved teaching through financing three principal types of&#13;
investments:&#13;
(a)    Fellowships (3 staff years) to train 3 persons in the training of teachers to strengthen the&#13;
staff of the Teacher Training College (TTC) one in the field of Science, another in Social&#13;
Studies and a third in Education&#13;
(b)    Equipment and supplies at the TTC, for science and language labs, audio-visual aids, and&#13;
library materials; and&#13;
(c)    In-service training programs during the summer vacations for primary school teachers&#13;
oriented toward content and teaching methods/pedagogy. The summer in-service&#13;
training program would provide a systematic upgrading system for teachers at the basic&#13;
level, to raise them to an acceptable level the competence in the four core subject areas.&#13;
The scope of this program will be agreed upon in advance with the Bank on a year-to-&#13;
year basis, as part of the annual project programming exercise. Overall, it is projected&#13;
that the training program would serve about 300 teachers.&#13;
5.21   As part of the Government's effort to professionalize the teaching service, the TTC would&#13;
require all new entrants into the two year diploma training program after 1998 to have at least four GCE&#13;
"O" level or CXC equivalent passes, including English, Mathematics, a Social Studies subject and a&#13;
Science subject. Moreover, by the year 2000, all teachers in the primary schools who have not secured at&#13;
least four CXC or GCE "O" level passes or the equivalent in each of the four core subject areas would be&#13;
reassigned either to other suitable public service jobs or, if they have demonstrated special ability to&#13;
work with young children, to the Pre-School system.&#13;
5.22   School Library Service. The project aims at intensifying the SLS bookmobile visits to the&#13;
Primary Schools, by providing an additional bookmobile to complement the activities of the bookmobile&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
that the now operates from Roseau. A Schools Library Center in Portsmouth would provide the base for&#13;
the new bookmobile service to the schools in the North and this Center would serve the schools in&#13;
Portsmouth as well. To this end, the project would finance:&#13;
(a)    Fellowships (5 staff years) to train (a) one person to pursue a 3 year degree in&#13;
librarianship, and (b) two persons each to attend a one year course to be trained as&#13;
library technicians, and a study tour (4 staff weeks) for the Chief Librarian to visit school&#13;
library services in other countries;&#13;
(b)    Construction of a Schools Library Center (including a garage for the bookmobile in&#13;
Portsmouth;&#13;
(c)    Related equipment, furniture and supplies for the Portsmouth center, and a new&#13;
bookmobile with 4000 book capacity, spare parts, and maintenance;&#13;
(d)    Studies on the impact of reading on student performance, and&#13;
(e)    Local workshops for teacher librarians on the use of the library in teaching.&#13;
Expansion of Access to Schools Component (US$3.9 million equivalent of base costs, or 49 percent of&#13;
total base costs)&#13;
5.23   The school mapping exercise, conducted during project preparation, highlighted the importance&#13;
of redressing serious shortfalls in secondary school places, while achieving a more equitable geographic&#13;
distribution of such places and improving primary to secondary transition rates. The project would&#13;
expand access to secondary education. This additional space, coupled with more efficient use of existing&#13;
space is expected to permit primary to secondary transition rates to rise to around 63 percent by the Year&#13;
2000. The project would also assist MOE to rehabilitate selected existing primary and secondary&#13;
schools in urgent need of such attention.&#13;
5.24   To these ends, the project would finance:&#13;
(a)    civil works, furniture and equipment, and equipment maintenance for (i) a new 525&#13;
place secondary school to increase coverage in a presently un-served area, Castle Bruce,&#13;
and (ii) classroom space (including 13 classrooms, 7 of which would replace existing&#13;
unsuitable rooms), a science laboratory and a toilet block at the existing secondary&#13;
school in Portsmouth;&#13;
(b)    rehabilitation of selected schools with urgent needs, identified as priority items in the&#13;
1994/95 school facilities study, and&#13;
(c)    preparation of a Master Plan for the development of the campus of the Portsmouth&#13;
secondary school by the architectural consultants.&#13;
5.25   The schedule of accommodation of the works to be undertaken under (a) above is provided in&#13;
Annex 5.. To complement project-financed activities, the Government, via the MOE, would undertake&#13;
the systematic training of principals and vice-principals in managing preventive maintenance and&#13;
mobilization of community support for maintenance. The program of rehabilitation of selected schools&#13;
26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
would be agteed annually by the Bank and the Association prior to the commencement of its&#13;
implementation. The Government would ensure either (a) public access to any public school constructed&#13;
on church lands or (b) public ownership or lease of the lands for the construction of such schools.&#13;

6. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
6.1    The total project cost is estimated at US$7.9 million equivalent, including duties and taxes&#13;
(US$0.5million equivalent) and physical and price contingencies. The foreign exchange component&#13;
represents US$6.1 million equivalent, or 77 percent of total project cost. A summary of project costs by&#13;
major component is provided in Table 6.1. As a percentage of base costs, financing for the three major&#13;
components is as follows: Strengthening Management and Planning (15), Qualitative Improvement (36),&#13;
and Expansion and Conservation of School Places (49). Detailed cost tables are provided in Annex 6,&#13;
Table IA-ID.&#13;
6.2    The cost estimates are based on prices as of June 1995. To the base cost of the civil works, 12&#13;
percent has been added to cover the costs of professional, consultant services, to meet the needs for&#13;
architectural design and tender preparation, and contract administration.&#13;
6.3    Contingency Allowances. Total contingencies of US$1 million equivalent represent 15 percent&#13;
of baseline project cost. These include physical contingencies of US$0.65 million equivalent, averaging&#13;
10 percent across the discrete components. Price contingencies (US$0.4 million equivalent), represent 6&#13;
percent of project baseline cost, and are based on the following assumptions: (a) a local inflation rate of&#13;
2.2 percent in 1995, and 2.0 percent per year thereafter; and (b) price increases for foreign costs,&#13;
estimated in US dollars, of 3.3 percent in 1995, and 2.7 percent for the remaining four years of project&#13;
implementation. Cost calculations also assume a nominal, constant exchange rate of EC$2.7 to US$ 1.00&#13;
for the five-year project implementation period.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Recurrent Costs and Project Sustainability&#13;
6.4  Incremental Recurrent Costs. The recurrent cost (not including incremental debt service)&#13;
generated by this project is estimated to be US$1.2 million per year by the end of the decade in current&#13;
prices. Estimates of these incremental recurrent costs are presented in Annex 6, Appendix. These&#13;
additional costs are attributable mainly to: (a) new positions in the MOE Establishment including the&#13;
library service and related travel and office and general expenses; (b) increased allowances for materials&#13;
and supplies and for operations and maintenance in primary and secondary schools and for the expanded&#13;
School Library Service (SLS); (c) additional costs of maintaining the equipment and furniture supplied&#13;
under the project, (d) the costs related to additional 735 secondary school places provided by the project;&#13;
and (e) cost of maintenance of the new buildings, including new school places, the DEO office in Castle&#13;
Bruce, MOE building and Library building in Portsmouth.&#13;
6.5    These incremental costs will be offset by about US$1.4 million equivalent in savings projected to&#13;
be generated by 2000 from the downward adjustments in the teacher to student ratios planned for the&#13;
1996-2001 period (Annex, the Appendix). In other words, the project will achieve a net decline in&#13;
recurrent expenditure on the sector.&#13;
6.6    Proiect Sustainability. The new Government has confirmed its support of the project, with&#13;
planned qualitative improvements and expansion of access to education widely viewed as essential to&#13;
achieve desired economic growth and social development objectives. Requisite Government financing&#13;
for the project, including its contribution of US$1.3 million equivalent (net of taxes) and incremental&#13;
debt service associated therewith, can be met, as they represent less than I percent of the 1994 GDP.&#13;
Further, there are no net annual incremental recurrent costs to be generated by the end of project&#13;
implementation, (Table 6.2).&#13;

6.7    Dominica is eligible for borrowing from IBRD under Single Currency Loan (SCL) terns&#13;
because: (i) it has no unconverted VLR82 loans, and (ii) the proposed loan does not exceeds US$100&#13;
million, although it represents 100 percent of IBRD lending program for FY 1996. Presented with the&#13;
choice of loan product, the Government decided on the fixed exchange rate US dollar SCL option. This&#13;
choice was based on the effort of eliminating exchange rate volatility (the EC dollar is pegged to the US&#13;
dollar) and minimizing interest rate uncertainty for a social sector project such as the proposed one.&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.8    The technical assistance program included in this project, detailed in Annex 7, Table 2, has been&#13;
designed to maximize development of local expertise and capacity in order to sustain project benefits&#13;
well into the future. The mix of expert services and fellowships, structured to complement one another,&#13;
emphasizes staff development. Orientation seminars and study tours have been included to familiarize&#13;
senior staff with key aspects of educational reform. Eligibility criteria for all project-supported training&#13;
will be specified in a Project Implementation Manual (PIM) (Para. 7.2). Fellows will be selected with&#13;
attention to their capacity to benefit from the respective training program and the program will be&#13;
tailored to their job needs in Dominica and be complemented in several cases by short attachments to&#13;
relevant agencies or entities abroad. These fellows will be drawn largely from the public service&#13;
(teaching and the civil service). Their job experience will sharpen awareness of their own training needs.&#13;
In keeping with normal Government policy, all fellows will be bonded to serve for an appropriate&#13;
duration of time following their training. Upon completion of training and return to Dominica, all&#13;
fellows will be expected to produce reports on their training experience and to conduct seminars to&#13;
disseminate their newly acquired knowledge to others. Most of the expert services will be provided in a&#13;
series of short term consultancies, with these services timed in order that: (a) while local staff remain in&#13;
direct control of operations, they will receive external assistance at certain critical junctures; and (b) the&#13;
tenure of fellowships and expert service periods are optimally synchronized. Finally, all experts will be&#13;
required to train staff and to prepare manuals to help guide staff in how specific key tasks should be&#13;
organized and programmed.&#13;
C. Financing Plan&#13;
6.9    The proposed project would be financed by an IBRD Loan and an IDA Credit totaling US$6.1&#13;
million equivalent, representing 77 percent of the total project cost. The combined Loan and Credit&#13;
would cover 100 percent of total foreign exchange investment expenditures and 50 percent of local&#13;
investment expenditures for goods. The Government would finance US$1.8 million equivalent or 100&#13;
percent of all local investment costs (net of taxes), except for goods financed at 50 percent of their local&#13;
investment costs, and 100 percent of local and foreign recurrent costs, and US$0.5 million equivalent in&#13;
taxes.&#13;
6.10   Table 6.3 provides a summary of the project financing plan. Annex 6, Table 2A includes the&#13;
detailed financing plan by component. The phasing of the Government financing and the Government's&#13;
inclusion of the required amounts in "Dominica Annual Estimates of Expenditure" for the years 1996&#13;
through 2000 are both to be addressed in the ESL (Para. 5.4). The Government would provide the&#13;
official Annual "Estimates" for the years 1996 through 2000, the necessary minimum equivalent&#13;
amounts of project financing required for project implementation11, estimated to be: US$2.7 million in&#13;
1996; US$2.7 million in 1997; US$0.8 million in 1998; US$1.4 million in 1999; and US$0.3million in&#13;
2000.&#13;
The amounts per fiscal year are the following: US$1.4 million for FY1995/96; US$2.7 million for&#13;
FY 1996/97; US$1.7 million for FY 1997/98; US$1.1 million for FY 1998/99; US$0.8 million for FY 1999/00;&#13;
US$0.2 million for FY 2000/01&#13;

6.11   Retroactive financing up to SDR 410,000 (US$ 614,000 equivalent), or 10 percent of combined&#13;
IBRD and IDA project financing, would be provided to reimburse the Government for eligible&#13;
expenditures incurred after October 1995, to enable the Government to immediately commence requisite&#13;
steps to expedite the reform process, including: (a) equipping of the newly established PMU, training of&#13;
its staff in such general areas as procurement, and Bank-specific procedures , and provision of study&#13;
tours for them to visit other project units in the Caribbean and of expert services to assist in&#13;
operationalizing the Unit and formulating the PIM; (b) architectural design works and tenders&#13;
preparation for the civil works; and (c) preparation of lists and specifications for the equipment and&#13;
furniture to be procured under the project. This retroactive financing is required to permit these&#13;
important outlays to be eligible for consideration for immediate reimbursement upon Loan and Credit&#13;
Effectiveness.&#13;
31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Management and Coordination&#13;
7.1    The project would be executed by the MOE through the creation of the PMU with functions and&#13;
responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank and the Association, with at least three full-time professional&#13;
personnel-a Project Manager, Procurement Officer, and an Accountant-with qualifications satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank and the Association, assisted by sufficient numbers of support staff.&#13;
7.2   In implementing the project, the PMU and other entities involved in project execution would be&#13;
guided by the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). The PIM, the final content of which will be agreed&#13;
with the Bank and the Association, will include the following main items: (a) organizational&#13;
arrangements, including specific relationships and responsibilities for project execution; (b) the content&#13;
of all the components and sub-components of the project; (c) operational procedures (both Government&#13;
and Bank as appropriate) for the procurement of goods, works and services to be followed in project&#13;
implementation, including criteria for: rehabilitation of schools; eligibility for, and processing&#13;
requirements relating to, project-supported training (fellowships, in-service and study tours) and&#13;
reference to the Bank' Guidelines for the use of consultants; and selection of planning and policy-related&#13;
studies (d) a timetable delineating targeted completion dates for the project components, including the&#13;
planning and policy-related studies; (e) disbursement and procurement arrangements, including reference&#13;
to the standard bidding documents to be used for works and goods, and standard consultant contracts;&#13;
(f) financial management and control arrangements, including Terms of Reference (TORs) and schedule&#13;
for internal and external project audits and project monitoring and evaluation; (g) agreed project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation indicators, to guide assessment of project implementation performance during&#13;
the Annual and mid-term Project Reviews; (h) TORs for the staff of the PMU and all the experts to be&#13;
employed under the project and (i) such other matters as may be agreed between the Government and the&#13;
Bank and the Association. As a condition of Loan and Credit Effectiveness, the Government will be&#13;
expected to have ensured that the agreed PIM had been issued, in terms satisfactory to the Bank and the&#13;
Association, and provided appropriate assurances that the Manual is in full force and effect.&#13;
B. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
7.3    As a source of advice and counseling during project implementation, a Project Advisory&#13;
Committee (PAC) will be established with representation from the Ministries with responsibility for the&#13;
portfolios of Education, Finance, Personnel and Public Works. The Project Manager would serve as&#13;
Secretary. The PAC will meet periodically to review implementation performance and will be convened,&#13;
as needed, to address any urgent matters which might arise over the course of project execution. To&#13;
ensure achievement of project objectives, the MOE will need to collaborate closely with several other&#13;
government entities, including the Ministry of Finance, a representative of which will countersign all&#13;
applications for withdrawal of the proceeds of the Loan and Credit.&#13;
32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C. Implementation Program&#13;
7.4           The project would be implemented over the five-year period 1996-2000, with some&#13;
front loading because of the urgency of having the fellowships begin as soon as possible and the fact that&#13;
the prepearatory architectural work would begin early under Japanese Grant financing. An&#13;
Implementation Schedule, by component and sub-component, is presented in Annex 7, Table 1. The&#13;
project Completion Date would be December 31, 2000, and the Closing Dates for the Loan and Credit&#13;
would be June 30, 2001. Civil works execution, overseas fellowships, and provision of expert services&#13;
are heavily concentrated over the first and second year of project implementation (or over the second&#13;
and third fiscal years) in order to ensure that these key inputs are rapidly completed . At the same time,&#13;
the requirement for capital outlays on the part of the Government as well as the project impact on the&#13;
recurrent budget have been kept at reasonable levels taking into account the severity of the fiscal&#13;
constraints in Dominica over the next 1-3 years.&#13;
7.5    Not later than six months after the Closing Date or such later dates as may be agreed for this&#13;
purpose, government will (i) prepare and furnish to the Association and the Bank a plan of such scope&#13;
and detail as IDA and IBRD may reasonably request for the future operations of the Project, (ii)&#13;
exchange view with IBRD and IDA on such plan, and (iii) carry out such plan, taking into account IBRD&#13;
and IDA comments on it.&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
7.6    Part XIII of the Government's Financial (Stores) Regulations prescribes guidelines for "The&#13;
purchase of Stores, etc., and the tenders procedure for Supplies". In practice, these regulations are&#13;
applied by the whole public sector to the procurement of goods and works at large. Goods and supplies&#13;
whose contract value exceeds EC$ 1,000 are to be procured through a public tendering procedure with at&#13;
least three bidders, and contracts are awarded by a Public Tendering Board (PTB). In the case of&#13;
contracts for the provision of works, the bidders must pre-qualify and the MOW is usually charged with&#13;
the responsibility for the technical evaluation of bids, although, for large projects, or whenever it is&#13;
required by external financiers, a private independent consulting firm is contracted to this end. These&#13;
regulations and procedures appear to grant a sufficient degree of transparency to the procurement&#13;
process. However, they are in need of updating and revision, especially in light of the limited exposure&#13;
of the public sector in Dominica to the requirements of large projects and international procurement and&#13;
financing.&#13;
7.7    While civil works for education sector projects in many countries have usually been procured&#13;
with only minor problem, the procurement of instructional materials and equipment has proven difficult.&#13;
Some of the more common and costly problems that occur during procurement of instructional&#13;
equipment in various countries are: (a) limited technical knowledge of optimum types and sources of&#13;
educational equipment, materials, supplies, and hence difficulties in writing precise and appropriate&#13;
technical specifications; (b) inexperience in packaging contracts to obtain potential economies of scale of&#13;
purchase; (c) difficulties in appropriately timing the placement of orders in order to synchronize delivery&#13;
dates with the actual time that the given goods will be required, particularly to coincide with the state of&#13;
readiness of civil works; (d) limitations in the capacity to conduct of technical evaluation of bids;&#13;
(e) insufficient attention to inspection of goods and bills of lading upon arrival of procured items; and&#13;
(g) the virtual neglect of enforcement of insurance and warranty clauses.&#13;
33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7.8    Several steps have been taken to avoid such problems in this project. First, prior to&#13;
commencement of project implementation, the full-time Procurement Officer will receive intensive,&#13;
practical training, and attend relevant Bank-seminars. Two officers of MOE attended the three day&#13;
project launch workshop held in June 1995 in St. Lucia for a series of projects including the St. Lucia&#13;
Basic Education Reform Project. Second, specialized expert services will be provided at critical points&#13;
in the procurement process, particularly in the first stages of project's implementation, to assist (as well&#13;
as to further train) the Procurement Officer in areas such as bidding technical specifications, processing&#13;
and evaluation. Third, to guide and expedite the procurement process, specification lists for goods to be&#13;
procured with project financing, and bidding documents for civil works and goods based on standard&#13;
Bank documents, will be prepared according to the Implementation Program. To further advance&#13;
preparation of civil works, architectural designs will be completed with Japanese Grant and retroactive&#13;
financing (Para. 6. 10), in order to permit initiation of the actual bidding process immediately upon&#13;
declaration of Loan and Credit Effectiveness. The Government would employ a firm of architectural&#13;
consultants, to provide architectural services and to coordinate other professional services required for&#13;
civil works, both experienced with the region and with Bank financed projects.&#13;
7.9    The designation of a full-time Procurement Officer to the PMU responds directly to the&#13;
experience gained in the OECS Regional Vocational and Technical Education Project (Credit 1785-&#13;
CRG), in particular the need for constant, careful attention to detailed selection and specifications of&#13;
goods (i.e., furniture and educational and related equipment and materials) to be purchased, and to&#13;
contracting procedures, ensuring: (a) upstream, compliance with Bank guidelines for selection of&#13;
consultants and consulting firms, and for procurement of civil works and goods; and (b) downstream,&#13;
that acquired goods meet the specifications and that equipment is appropriately and safely installed and&#13;
utilized.&#13;
7.10   Procurement procedures to be followed for all major categories of expenditures to be financed by&#13;
IBRD and IDA are described below and summarized in Table 7.&#13;
(1) Civil Works&#13;
7.11   Civil works to be procured with project financing (expected to total US$4.2 million equivalent,&#13;
including contingencies) consist of the following: (i) one new secondary school, of 525 places in Castle&#13;
Bruce, and the upgrading and expansion of the Portsmouth Secondary School (representing a net&#13;
addition of 210 places); ii) rehabilitation of selected primary and secondary schools; (iii) one new&#13;
District Office in Castle Bruce; (iv) new School Library Center in Portsmouth; and (v) office space for&#13;
new MOE management and technical units.&#13;
7.12   In view of the small value of all such works, the Bank Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) to be&#13;
used for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be "Procurement of Works Smaller Contracts"&#13;
and these same documents, modified as necessary, would be used for National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB). Civil works, including those for the rehabilitation of selected schools, would be grouped in&#13;
packages as far as it is practicable. All civil works contracts valued at US$0.5 million and above would&#13;
be awarded on the basis ICB, consistent with IBRD and IDA guidelines'2. Civil works estimated to cost&#13;
the equivalent of US$100,000 or more but less than the equivalent of US$0.5 million per contract, up to&#13;
an aggregate amount equivalent to US$1.0 million, may be procured on the basis of NCB. Civil works&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(including works for rehabilitation of selected schools), estimated to cost less than the equivalent of&#13;
US$100,000 per contract, may, consistent with IBRD and IDA guidelines and up to an aggregate amount&#13;
equivalent to US$0.8 million, be procured under lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from three qualified contractors in response to a written invitation and made to the&#13;
contractor who offers the lowest price quotation and has the experience and resources to complete the&#13;
contract successfully. All school rehabilitation works would require full documentation to include:&#13;
certification by the MOE that the works were of a priority nature, consistent with the school facilities&#13;
inventory; an approved budget for the subject work; review by the consultants for civil works of designs&#13;
and/or bidding documents prior to initiating any such works, and certification by the consultants for civil&#13;
works that the work was efficiently, fully and satisfactorily completed; and appropriate documentation of&#13;
local shopping procedures applied in the selection of contractors, all of which documentation would be&#13;
retained for review by IBRD and IDA supervision missions. No individual school would normally be&#13;
expected to receive rehabilitation works in excess of an aggregate amount of US$ 100,000 equivalent.&#13;
(2) Goods&#13;
7.13   School and Office Equipment (estimated to cost US$363,000 equivalent including&#13;
contingencies) Furniture (US$297,000),YVeiclei.(US$ 185,000), Textbooks and other educational&#13;
mateziWsi(US$404,000) and Office Supplies (US$276,000)would be grouped in packages as far as&#13;
practicable and procured in the following manner consistent with Bank guidelines:&#13;
(a)    Contract packages estimated to cost the equivalent or more than US$50,000 or more&#13;
would be procured on the basis of ICB;&#13;
(b)    Contract packages estimated to cost US$15,000 equivalent or more but less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent and US$900,000 equivalent in the aggregate, would be procured through&#13;
international shopping procedures, and&#13;
(c)    Contract packages estimated to cost less than US$15,000 equivalent and US$300,000&#13;
equivalent in the aggregate, would be procured through national shopping procedures.&#13;
7.14   Computer hardware and software (expected to total US$244,000 equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies)would be grouped, to the extent possible, in packages estimated to cost the equivalent of&#13;
US$50,000 or more and procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB) procedures.&#13;
Exceptionally, and with previous Bank no objection, packages of small value may be procured through&#13;
shopping procedures.&#13;
7.15   Bidding lists of eligible bidders for computers and software and for vehicles would include only&#13;
manufacturers who have established maintenance and service facilities in Dominica or in neighboring&#13;
countries.&#13;

7.16    Professional service contracts (expected to total US$442,000 equivalent including&#13;
contingencies) for architectural design, tendering, and supervision/administration of contracts relating to&#13;
36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the execution of IBRD and IDA-financed civil works would be procured according to Bank guidelines&#13;
for the use of consultants.13&#13;
7.17   Ept Services (expected to total US$428,000 equivalent, including contingencies), to include&#13;
contracts for consultants and consulting firms, would be awarded in accordance with the World Bank&#13;
guidelines for the use of consultants. Details of project-financed Expert Services are provided in Annex&#13;
7, Table 2.&#13;
7.18   Fellowships (expected to total US$675,000 including contingencies) would be awarded only to&#13;
persons suitably qualified to enter upon the agreed training programs, following Government selection&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank. Details of Fellowships are provided in Annex 7, Table 2.&#13;
7.19   Local Training (expected to total US$157,000 including contingencies) would be jointly&#13;
arranged by the specialized service of MOE concerned and the PMU. Trainers would be selected in&#13;
consultation between the concerned MOE unit and the PMU.&#13;
7.20   Studies (expected to total US$143,000 equivalent, including contingencies). With reference to&#13;
studies, the PMU and the concerned department would consult on the selection of consulting services&#13;
and the PMU would procure these in keeping with IBRD and IDA guidelines. For any necessary&#13;
materials in view of the small amounts involved, local shopping would be used.&#13;
(4) IBRD and II)A Review&#13;
7.21   Agreement was reached that the Government would: (a) prior to initiating any civil works or&#13;
acquisition of goods to be procured through ICB or LIB, and for those civil works to be procured via&#13;
NCB, submit to the Bank and Association for prior review all relevant documentation; (b) with regard to&#13;
consultants and consulting firms, submit all proposed contracts and related terms of reference, short lists&#13;
of candidates, proposed fees, etc. for prior IBRD and IDA review to ensure consistency with Bank&#13;
guidelines on use of consultants; and (c) to ensure consistency with project objectives, submit the names&#13;
and resumes of all shortlisted candidates for fellowships, the proposed training program and training&#13;
institution, and estimated cost for prior IBRD and IDA review. The budget for local training and for&#13;
studies would be agreed with the Bank and IDA in advance of initiating such activities and all relevant&#13;
documentation conceming expenditures on agreed studies and training would be retained for review by&#13;
IBRD and IDA supervision missions. For all procurement of goods and works not requiring prior&#13;
review from the Bank and the Association, all relevant documentation would be retained in PMU files by&#13;
IBRD and IDA supervision missions. Prior review coverage as a percentage of Bank-financed contracts&#13;
is estimated to amount to about 60 percent of goods and works contracts and 100 percent of consultants&#13;
contracts.&#13;
E. Disbursements and Accounts&#13;
7.22   The proposed Loan of US$3.07 million equivalent and Credit of SDR2.1 million (US$3.07&#13;
million equivalent), would be disbursed over a five-year period or ten semesters, typical of other IBRD&#13;
and IDA-supported social sector projects. Table 7.4 presents the disbursement forecast for the Loan and&#13;
3 Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency. The&#13;
World Bank, August 1981.&#13;
37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Credit. Disbursements would commence immediately at Loan and Credit Effectiveness with the&#13;
disbursement for retroactive financing and the initial disbursement into the project Special Account. To&#13;
facilitate timely project implementation, the Government would establish, maintain and operate, under&#13;
terms and conditions satisfactory to IBRD and IDA, a Special Account in US dollars at a bank acceptable&#13;
to IBRD and IDA. The Authorized allocation for the Special Account would be US$0.5 million&#13;
equivalent, with an initial deposit to be made of US$0.25 million equivalent, and such allocation to&#13;
remain limited to an amount equivalent to US$0.25 million until the aggregate amount of withdrawals&#13;
from the Credit Account, plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by&#13;
the Association, shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of US$ 1.0 million . The Special Account&#13;
would be managed by the Project Management Unit (PMU), with all disbursements made under&#13;
authorized signatures from designated representatives of both the Ministry of Finance and the PMU, and&#13;
withdrawal applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be prepared by the PMU in&#13;
accordance with Bank policies and procedures.&#13;
7.23   The Government would open a Project Account in a bank acceptable to IBRD and IDA and&#13;
deposit into such account an amount equivalent to not less than US$250,000, for purposes of financing&#13;
the implementation of the project and would maintain a positive balance in such account over the project&#13;
implementation period, in the amounts stipulated in the Development Credit Agreement.&#13;

7.24   Annex 7, Table 4 contains the projected Loan and Credit disbursement allocations.&#13;
Disbursements would be effected against the following expenditure categories, by percentage of IBRD&#13;
and IDA financing: (a) civil works, for construction of the new secondary school at Castle Bruce and the&#13;
expansion of the Portsmouth Secondary School, the new District Education Office at Castle Bruce, and&#13;
Schools Library Center in Portsmouth, and office space for the MOE management and technical units&#13;
and for professional fees related thereto for design, tender preparation and contract administration--  00&#13;
percent of foreign expenditure net of taxes(or 72 percent of total expenditure) (b) civil works for&#13;
rehabilitation of selected primary schools and professional fees related thereto-- 100 percent of foreign&#13;
expenditure net of taxes (or 72 percent of total expenditure); (c) goods including all equipment,&#13;
furniture, educational materials, computers and software, and supplies and miscellaneous-- 1 00 percent of&#13;
38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
foreign expenditure and 50% of local expenditure net of taxes (or 95 percent of total expenditure);&#13;
(d) technical assistance, including (i) expert services, (ii) fellowships, (iii) training and (iv) studies--100&#13;
percent of foreign expenditure net of taxes (or 75, 95, 50 and 50 percent respectively of total&#13;
expenditure).&#13;
7.25   Withdrawal applications for civil works with a contract value of US$100,000 or more equivalent&#13;
and for goods with a contract value of US$50,000 or more equivalent, would be supported by full&#13;
documentation. Disbursements for all contracts for civil works of less than US$100,000 equivalent,&#13;
including works associated with the rehabilitation of primary schools, and for contracts for goods of less&#13;
than US$50,000 equivalent would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) certified by&#13;
the PMU. Supporting documentation for these latter expenditures, as delineated in paragraph 7.23,&#13;
would be retained by the PMI, and be readily available for periodic review by IBRD and IDA&#13;
supervision missions.&#13;
F. Financial Management, Accounting and Audits&#13;
7.26   An evaluation of existing financial management procedures and the accounting systems and&#13;
administrative controls of MOE was carried out by the Bank. It was noted that the cotntry's financial&#13;
management system is highly centralized, with the Government Treasury responsible for general&#13;
financial control of the entire executive branch. At the level of the MOE. financial activities are limited&#13;
to providing information in accounting format to the MOF, for payment and final accounting purposes.&#13;
The existing financial management procedures in MOE would require strengthening over the medium-&#13;
term in order to support the modernization of the administration of the MOE. Improvements are needed&#13;
in accounting, budgeting, and financial planning and analysis. To these ends, the project supports (a)&#13;
training in financial analysis, operations research and economics of education for a person who will be&#13;
assigned to the EPU to conduct efficiency studies related to the cost and financing of education, and (b)&#13;
the establishment of an integrated, computerized education data system that would include financial&#13;
records. The PIM will provide detailed TORs for internal and external audits of project accounts&#13;
satisfactory to the IBRD and IDA. MOE would also strengthen its financial management operations by&#13;
adding an executive officer (Accounts) to its staff.&#13;
7.27   The technical review conducted during the preparatory phase further concluded that the&#13;
Government Audit Department has the required independence to meet Bank audit requirements, as it&#13;
reports directly to Parliament. With regard to its technical capacity, senior staff have been exposed to&#13;
several audits of externally financed projects.&#13;
7.28   The MOE would keep separate accounts for project incurred expenditures according to the&#13;
proposed Charts of Accounts (as detailed in Schedule I of the Loan and Credit Agreements) and prepare&#13;
a monthly statement of expenditures. This procedure will facilitate the preparation of withdrawal&#13;
applications and expedite the disbursement process. Annual audits of all project accounts, including the&#13;
Special Account, will be undertaken by an independent auditor. Initially, it is proposed that this&#13;
independent auditor be the Government Audit Department. The requisite audit reports would be&#13;
prepared and submitted to the Bank and Association not later than four months after the end of each&#13;
fiscal year'4 (i.e., not later than October 30) under TORs satisfactory to IBRD and IDA. Should the&#13;
14 Fiscal year runs from July I to June 30.&#13;
39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Government Audit Department prove unable to carry out such audits in a timely fashion, the Bank and&#13;
the Association would require the use of a private sector firm.&#13;
G. Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
(1) Project Performance Reporting&#13;
7.29   Overall responsibility for monitoring, evaluation and reporting of project performance would be&#13;
assigned to the PMU. The PMU also would be responsible for the preparation of the Borrower's section&#13;
of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) that would be transmitted to the IBRD and IDA not&#13;
later than six months after the Closing Date. To ensure and expedite fulfillment of periodic reporting&#13;
requirements relating to project implementation status, and to facilitate the conduct of regular project&#13;
supervision missions, the PIM will schedule consolidated project progress reports to be prepared by the&#13;
PMU by September 30 and March 31 each year, and these would be distributed to IBRD and IDA, and to&#13;
CDB for information. The March 31 report would serve as the basis for an annual in depth review of&#13;
project performance to be carried out by the Government, IBRD and IDA.&#13;
7.30   The annual March 31 project status report will include: (i) a summary of the project performance&#13;
over the past year, measured against agreed project monitoring and evaluation indicators, delineated in&#13;
Annex 7, Table 5; and (ii) a detailed work program and budget (including planned contracting of expert&#13;
services and initiation of planning and policy-related studies) for the forthcoming year of project&#13;
implementation, and a realistic implementation schedule and targets for moving the project toward its&#13;
successful completion.&#13;
(2) Project Reviews&#13;
7.31   Annual reviews of project performance would take place no later than May 31 each year of the&#13;
1997-2000 period between the IBRD and IDA and Government. A joint mid-term Review of the&#13;
performance of the Basic Education Reform Project and the education reform process which it supports&#13;
would be undertaken not later than June 30, 1998. For such review, the PMU would prepare, and jointly&#13;
IBRD, IDA and the Government would review a summary report including assessment of: (a) the&#13;
overall implementation performance of the project during its first two-and-one-half years in terms of its&#13;
progress toward achieving the agreed project objectives, targets and indicators; (b) the adequacy of&#13;
available and planned project financing; (c) compliance with IBRD and IDA procurement and&#13;
disbursement requirements, and (d) the outcome of the annual audit reports. Subsequent to this review, a&#13;
plan of action to guide the successful completion of the project will be prepared. A Project Supervision&#13;
Plan is provided in Annex 7, Table 6. As part of such Annual Review, the MOE may be asked to prepare&#13;
an action plan, satisfactory to IBRD and IDA, to make adjustments in project implementation, as the&#13;
review process may indicate to be needed to achieve project objectives. In such case, the Government&#13;
should furnish this action plan to IBRD/IDA no later than one month after conclusion of the respective&#13;
review, and shall thereafter carry out such action plan in accordance with its terms. The Government&#13;
would indicate in the PIM its intention to comply fully and in a timely manner with the Project reporting&#13;
and review requirements, all of which would be incorporated in the PIM.&#13;
40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
H. Project Supervision&#13;
7.32   During supervision missions, which will be timed so as to follow closely upon the half yearly&#13;
reports, the Bank and Association will:&#13;
(a)    review the achievements in project implementation against the Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation indicators as set out in Annex 7 Table 5 and covered in the half yearly report;&#13;
(b)    assist in resolving problems that have emerged since the previous supervision mission;&#13;
(c)    discuss any changes in policy or the functioning of the sector that have a bearing on the&#13;
project and project implementation and;&#13;
(d)    review selected documents retained in project files pertaining to procurement of goods&#13;
and works.&#13;
In particular, as the following activities are ongoing, the supervision missions will pay special attention&#13;
to:&#13;
(i)   the adjustment of teacher to student ratios, the changes in the ratio of salary to&#13;
non salary expenditures, and the application of resources to school maintenance&#13;
and supplies;&#13;
(ii)   the preparation and processing of the long range sector plan;&#13;
(iii)   the strengthening of management and planning in MOE, including project&#13;
management capacity;&#13;
(iv)    the program of studies, and&#13;
(v)    the quality of expert services provided.&#13;
7.33   As this project will be a first effort of the kind in the sector in the country and the investment is&#13;
front loaded, the visits of supervision missions will be more frequent in the early stages: every four&#13;
months in the first year of implementation, every six months thereafter, each visit involving a total of&#13;
about 3 staff days. Other ad hoc missions or a longer stay in the field may be necessary for the resolution&#13;
of specific problems that may arise&#13;
I. Environmental Impact&#13;
7.34   The proposed project does not represent environmental risks. It has been assigned a "C"&#13;
environmental classification.&#13;
41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
8.1    The proposed project would significantly increase educational opportunities, particularly for&#13;
students from the more remote areas. An additional 735 children, or an increment of 10 percent of the&#13;
public secondary school places, will have access to secondary education via project-financed civil works.&#13;
Major improvements are expected in education provided throughout the compulsory cycle and, hence, in&#13;
student achievement and employment potential, from the considerable investments targeted toward&#13;
enhancing quantitatively and qualitatively the major educational inputs, i.e., trained teachers, curricula,&#13;
the schools library service, educational materials, testing and measurement, and school plant. The&#13;
disadvantaged minority group, (Caribs) will be specifically assisted through the educational materials&#13;
that would be supplied to the four school located in the Carib reserve territory, and their access to&#13;
secondary education would be enhanced by the provision of the secondary school in Castle Bruce.&#13;
About 1,000 children, half of which from the Carib territory, would benefit from project support for&#13;
textbooks to disadvantaged schools. An improved quality of primary education is expected to help&#13;
ensure that many more students will be prepared to benefit fully from secondary education, as access to it&#13;
increases. The project should also contribute significantly to building institutional capacity, particularly&#13;
at the MOE central Headquarters, district and school levels. It promotes increased collaboration between&#13;
key public and private sector entities involved in the education sector at the national and regional level;&#13;
the reforms undertaken are consistent with the OECS Education Reform Strategy. Project support to&#13;
such discrete areas as achievement testing, integrated education data systems, and expansion and&#13;
upgrading of educational materials production, will create a basis for OECS regional collaboration, given&#13;
common interest in these initiatives.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
8.2    The principal risks associated with the project relate to: (i) inadequate institutional capacity to&#13;
carry out the education reform process; (ii) the stringent fiscal situation; (iii) possible failure to adjust&#13;
or to closely monitor compliance with the adjustment of the teacher to student ratios in primary and&#13;
secondar,, schools; and (iv) PMU problems in meeting the administrative demands presented by heavy&#13;
front ie.Jding of implementation over the first three years, given limited execution experience with Bank&#13;
financed projects. To minimize potential institutional failures, strong emphasis is placed on sector&#13;
planning and institutional strengthening, including extensive staff upgrading via both overseas and local&#13;
training, and Government assurances that the MOE personnel complement will be expanded to ensure&#13;
that expertise exists to fulfill its broad education sector development mandate.&#13;
8.3    To promote inter-country collaboration, high priority will continue to be assigned to pooling&#13;
technical resources, encouraging the use of Caribbean expertise, sharing of experiences and developing&#13;
regional interaction, where appropriate and feasible. Several measures are being taken to facilitate&#13;
smooth, timely project implementation, amid front loading of investments, including: (a) advancing&#13;
crucial start-up activities, e.g., architectural designs and equipment and furniture specification lists, to be&#13;
carried out before Effectiveness, via Japanese grant funds; (b) training of PMU staff in key management&#13;
areas prior to project implementation, to be facilitated by retroactive financing; and (c) provision of 8&#13;
42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
months of Project Management expert services to support the PMU over the initial months of project&#13;
execution.&#13;
8.4    Given vulnerabilities of this small economy to external factors and shocks, Government project&#13;
financing has been kept within easily met ranges at present and projected GDP, and has been&#13;
concentrated on the local cost portion of the costs. Incremental recurrent costs, often hampering&#13;
achievement of education sector reforms, will be offset by resources to be released from adjusting&#13;
teacher to student ratios over the project implementation period. The effective realization of these&#13;
savings and their transfers to the agreed purposes will be closely monitored on the base of a schedule to&#13;
be included in the Education Strategy Letter. Minimization of financial risks is achieved through the&#13;
choice of loan product by the Government: fixed rate US dollar SCL (para. 6.7). Moreover, the project&#13;
places emphasis on the early preparation of a long term sector development plan which would serve as a&#13;
vehicle for achieving national consensus on the principal directions of sector development into the next&#13;
decade.&#13;
8.5    Finally, the monitoring system and annual evaluations will pernit to adopt timely adjustments&#13;
in project implementation needed to achieve project objectives.&#13;
43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
A. Agreements Reached&#13;
9.1    At negotiations, the Government and IBRD and IDA reached final agreement on:&#13;
(a) the general content of the Education Strategy Letter (Para. 5.3). The letter will describe:&#13;
(i) the Government education sector reform strategy;&#13;

9.2    As conditions of Loan and Credit Effectiveness, the Government will present to the Bank and&#13;
Association:&#13;
(i) the Education Strategy Letter, prepared in terms satisfactory to the Bank and the&#13;
Association;&#13;
(ii) the Project Implementation Manual, issued in terms satisfactory to the Bank and&#13;
Association along with evidence that this Manual is in full force and effect; and&#13;
(iii) evidence that the Governrment has opened a Pr ject Account in a bank acceptable to&#13;
the Bank and the Association, and deposited into such account an amount equivalent to&#13;
44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
not less than US$250,000 for implementation of the project, and that the Government&#13;
would maintain a positive balance in such account over the implementation period, in the&#13;
amounts stipulated in the Development Credit Agreement, during which period all&#13;
project activities are expected to be fully executed.&#13;
B. Recommendation&#13;
9.3    With the above agreements and assurances, the Project would constitute a suitable basis for a&#13;
Loan of US$3.07 million equivalent and a Credit of SDR 2.1 million (US$3.07 million equivalent) to the&#13;
Commonwealth of Dominica.&#13;

The MOE and the Sector Budget - Annex 3 - Appendix&#13;
DOMINICA: PROPOSED BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
WORKNG PAPER ON BUDGETARY REALLOCATION IN EDUCATION&#13;
1.     In the education sector in Dominica, there are two overriding efficiency issues--one concerning&#13;
the efficiency of management and the other the efficiency of the schools:&#13;
(a)    the absence of sufficient specialized management staff to lead and guide the schools and&#13;
(b)    the low share of school budgets spent on non-salary items.&#13;
The management deficiency is masked by the persistent, hard work of a few, but a broader effort is&#13;
needed to sustain reform and to keep costs within reasonable limits. Low non-salary expenditure&#13;
seriously affects teacher morale and student performance.&#13;
2.     The financial commitment being made by the Government to education falls within the&#13;
reasonable range (15% and 25%) of the national recurrent budget. The sector share is budgeted to be&#13;
17.7% in 1994-5 (including the UWI subvention of $1,354,865). This is lower than the share allocated in&#13;
St. Lucia (22-25%), but it is expected to rise over the long term. In the current fiscal situation, the&#13;
immediate solution to funding deficiencies in the sector would lie in an intra-sectoral reallocation of the&#13;
sector budget rather than in an immediate increase in the sector share of the national budget.&#13;
3.     This Working Paper examines how resources might be found within the existing budget to&#13;
strengthen sector management and more effectively provide the schools with the furniture, equipment,&#13;
materials and supplies and the maintenance services essential to good teaching.&#13;
4.     Adjustment of Teacher to Student Ratios. We tend too readily to equate high teacher to&#13;
student ratios with high quality in education, although research has shown that teacher to student ratios,&#13;
except at the extremes, bear little relationship to student performance. Examples in Dominica as&#13;
elsewhere, show that the "best" performing public schools do not generally have the highest ratios but&#13;
they are the best managed.&#13;
5.     The current teacher to student ratios in Dominica are far more generous than those in numerous&#13;
countries in similar, worse or better economic circumstances , and these ratios are becoming even more&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The MOE and the Sector Budget - Annex 3 - Appendix&#13;
generous. For example, Table IA, Annex 2 shows an increase in the ratios for both public and private&#13;
schools from  1:27.5 in 1984-85 to 1:21.7 in 1994, and it is estimated that in 1995 it has reached 1:20.5.&#13;
This has resulted in no clear improvement in the quality of primary education. At secondary level, the&#13;
increase was from 1:21.2 (Table I B, Annex 2) to 1: 16.6 over the same period of time during which the&#13;
performance of secondary schools in the CXC deteriorated (Table2B, Annex2). Moreover, there are no&#13;
firm standards--ratios are not now uniform across the country. In primary education, where the average&#13;
2&#13;
ratio was 1:23.4 in 1994-95 , individual schools ranged from  1:11 to 1:33 and in secondary education,&#13;
where the average was 1:16.5, they ranged from  1:13.4 to 1:20.2.3&#13;
6.       It therefore appears necessary for the Ministry to establish realistic standards and apply them&#13;
judiciouslv, taking into account the special needs of small schools, which, even with a more rational&#13;
distribution of schools, the use of multi grade teaching and clustering, will require more generous ratios&#13;
than large schools.4 An average ratio of 1:30 at primary level and 1:25 at secondary level (if no 6th&#13;
forms are involved) is not unreasonable. In the medium term, a feasible aim  would be 1:26 at primary&#13;
and 1:20 at secondary level, with the longer term  (i.e. 10 year) objective of 1:30+ and 1:25, respectively.5&#13;
7.       Decisions on staff to student ratios and the organization of schools and curricula are only part of&#13;
a complex of decisions on delivering educational services, all of which have large financial implications&#13;
when applied system-wide. This complex needs to be carefully thought out and based on policies and&#13;
standards arrived at in full recognition of their financial and educational implications. The system-wide&#13;
financial impact of small changes in ratios is considerable. Hence, schools should be: (a) guided on their&#13;
staffing needs in view of the limited resources available; (b) helped to use staff efficiently and (c)&#13;
advised on economic alternatives in organizing curricula and time-tables. For this crucial leadership&#13;
role, the Ministry needs more trained, senior staff.&#13;
2 More work will be needed to establish the exact ratio. The MOE figures on current staffing are incomplete and do not show the&#13;
numbers on leave or the temporary staff substituting for them. This deficiency does not affect the validity of the phasing shown in Table&#13;
1; it merely means that the starting point is yet to be precisely determined.&#13;
3 Among the 59 primary schools,3 had no data on staff, 13 were 1:16 or above, l5were between 1:17 and 1:21, 21 between 1:22 and&#13;
1:26, and 7 below 1:27. The 13 secondary schools fell between 1:13.4 and 1:20.2, excluding one that had no staff data.&#13;
For example, for an average nation-wide ratio of 1:28, the actual ratios by public school might be as follows:&#13;
Enrollment             Standard Ratio                          Impact as applied to existing system:&#13;

For further reductions, the larger schools can move to 1:35, bringing the average to 1:30.&#13;
5 Currently, the increase is occurring at the secondary level while there is a decline at the primary level. By 2001 there will probably&#13;
be some increase in the primary level school age population but this will probably be offset in the primary schools by the increased rate&#13;
of transition of children of the post primary age group into the secondary schools. Detailed analysis will be needed to refine the&#13;
projections.&#13;

The MOE and the Sector Budget - Annex 3 - Appendix&#13;
8.      The 1994-95 budget for salaries constitutes 94.8%  of the total Primary sub-sector allocation and&#13;
94.9% of the Government Secondary School budget. Funds for other urgent needs of the schools--&#13;
supplies, materials, repairs of physical plant, testing, supervision, training etc.--to provide the&#13;
environment in which principals, teachers and students can perform at an optimal level are therefore&#13;
quite constrained. Shifting funds from salaries to these other school purposes, would represent a more&#13;
balanced and productive mix of resources for teaching.&#13;
9.      No drastic measures would be needed in order to achieve this adjustment. Phasing the change&#13;
would obviate the need to retrench teachers, but would reduce sharply the recruitment of new ones over&#13;
the next few years. Such a slowdown would present an opportunity for consolidation--improving&#13;
average qualification levels and performance standards of teachers. The slowdown should begin soon&#13;
because primary enrollment is in the process of a decline which might endure for a few years.&#13;
TABLE 1 Parts 1-3 sets out the implications of such phasing.&#13;

10.      Such an adjustment can yield, by 2000-01, some EC$3.8M. in "savings" to strengthen sector&#13;
management and improve direct support to the schools in terms of furniture, equipment, materials and&#13;
supplies and maintenance of physical plant. The transfer of savings to these purposes would need to be&#13;
guaranteed; otherwise, educational standards will decline even further and the frustration levels among&#13;
the teachers will rise.&#13;

are listed in the IALLEZ.&#13;

12.    The preliminary estimate of recurrent cost is EC$1.72 million (US$65 1,000). Salary amounts&#13;
are not very precise and need to be refined by MOE. The phasing of staff needs to be refined as well.&#13;
The assumptions made here indicate the need for about 39 more positions, 24 at the professional level&#13;
and 15 at the clerical/technical level. The exact amount would depend on rationalizing the use of typists&#13;
and drivers (some of whom can come from the existing service); it remains to be determined how many&#13;
of the library positions are additional. About 20 of these new officers can come from staff in the schools,&#13;
either to fill the new positions or to replace officers promoted into new posts. This expenditure on Head&#13;
Office has its benefits. It will help to eliminate waste and inefficiencies arising from: (i) the inadequacy&#13;
of supervision and control, and (ii) delays in formnulating appropriate policies to deal with emerging&#13;
situations; and it will build the infrastructure for sustained sector reform and development, which by&#13;
itself would have required an increase in the staff. At present, only six percent of the sector budget goes&#13;
to management--about the lowest in the OECS. With this change in numbers, there will be modernized&#13;
equipping of offices and personnel training. These measures should raise the productivity of the&#13;
management and efficiency in the schools.&#13;
Improving Direct Support to the Schools.&#13;

14.    No figures are given for 1995-96 to 1997-98. In this period the funding for these perposes would&#13;
come from two sources: first, the regular MOE's budget at the current levels (which are expected to&#13;
remain constant throughout the project implementation period and beyond); second, the project capital&#13;
investments in supplies and rehabilitation. The present low recurrent allocations per student would be&#13;
raised substantially, but gradually, in order to permit management capacity and institutional procedures&#13;
to be built up in procuring and managing the goods and services to be provided. The project would assist&#13;
in this by the absorption of the existing services into the PMU where they would be better supported&#13;
professionally through the oversight of the procurement officer and the project manager. These services&#13;
would also be better equipped and provided more assured recurrent financing to undertake sector-wide&#13;
procurement of furniture, equipment, materials and supplies and the maintenance of buildings and&#13;
equipment.&#13;
15.    The impact, in per student terms, would be as follows:&#13;

This will allow for a basic supply of equipment and materials and a limited number of books.&#13;

b/ Amounts shown here are additional to the 1994-5 provision which was $203,000 for Supplies &amp; Materials and S182,500 for Operations &amp;&#13;
Maintenance. The slow build-up in regard to these two categories (S &amp; M and 0 &amp; M) will permit time for the institutional strengthening to be&#13;
accomplished so that expenditure could be efficiently managed. See table 3 for details&#13;
cl Set Table IPasrt 3 for details.&#13;
dt Note: In 1996-8 there will be project capital investment in these categories while absorptive capacity is being built up.&#13;
17.      The adjustment will have an important impact both on the MOE and national recurrent budgets and&#13;
on the overall public service establishment. Table 5 presents the projected evolution of the sector budget;&#13;
this will need to be refined in the light of (a) some rationalizing of existing posts and duties and (b) the&#13;
proposed long range plan that will be prepared under the project. This set of projections allows modest&#13;
annual growth rates in some sub-sectors--technical/vocational (10%), tertiary (2% to 1997 and 5%&#13;
thereafter) and Pre-School (3% to 1997 and 10% thereafter). Without increases in these subsectors, the&#13;
overall sector budget would remain stable despite the overall enrollment increase. The overall growth of&#13;
the sector can be accommodated within about 16%  of the national recurrent budget, assuming that the latter&#13;
grows at about 2%  per annum. The sector share would decline from  17.1%  in 1994-95 to 16%  in 2000-&#13;
01.16&#13;
6These projections accept much of the status quo in the system. This should not be taken to mean that all of this is endorsed. For&#13;
example, the 43.9%/o growth in the Assisted secondary school budget between 1991-92 and 1994-95 outstrips the overall sector budget&#13;
growth of only 18% in the same period. Moreover, the wide inter-school disparities in per student costs at the secondary level is a problem.&#13;
These are among the issues that will be examined by the proposed secondary school study that to be undertaken in September-October of&#13;
1995.&#13;

dift'erence between these figures and the official estimates is included under Other costs which are not projected to increase in the same manner&#13;
as the suppli_s and maintenance costs. As indicated above, there will be substantial project investments in supplies and maintenance over&#13;
the period 1996-98: these capital costs are not shown here.&#13;

18.     The impact of the adjustment on the public establishment of posts is set out in Table 6. The&#13;
comparisons are presented only in respect of the sub-sectors in which change is brought about by the&#13;
adjustment.t"&#13;
There would be minor increases in such subsectors as tertiary, technical/vocational and special education; but these are not directly&#13;
connected with the adjustment program and the increases are expected to be negligible if efficiency measures are adopted.&#13;

19.    Despite the increase in the number of central administration positions, the overall sector&#13;
establishment would decline by some 60 positions over the six year period. This decline would produce&#13;
benefits in the labor market, since it releases funds for improved supplies of educational materials to&#13;
schools and maintenance services that will stimulate activity in the construction industry, the book trade and&#13;
other distributive trades.&#13;
20.    The adjustment program would therefore produce the following important benefits:&#13;
(a)    it will provide for better planning and more efficient management of a sector that absorbs&#13;
an appreciable share of the national budget;&#13;
(b)    while maintaining teacher to student ratios at a reasonable and affordable level, it would&#13;
lead to a more productive use of available resources through improved provision of&#13;
educational materials, regular maintenance of school facilities and enhanced training,&#13;
supervision and support of teachers;&#13;
(c)    over the medium term, during the fiscal crisis faced by the Government, the overall burden&#13;
of the sector on the national budget would be maintained at its current level or slightly&#13;
reduced, and&#13;
(d)    it would be in line with the Government's effort to reduce the public personnel&#13;
establishment and stimulate private sector development and job creation.&#13;

Teacher Load&#13;
3Includes one to make up for the Vice-principal and department Heads who would have a lighterr than ordinary teaching loads (e.g. the VP&#13;
20%. less and the deparetment heads 10-15% less). Bearing in mind current practice in Dominica and the desired goals in regard to teacher to&#13;
student ratios, the school should be allowed approximately:&#13;
Year 1-8 teachers (105 students); Year 2-13 teachers (210 students); Year 3--18 teachers (315 students); Year 4--20 teachers (420&#13;
students) and Year 5-21 teachers (525 students).&#13;

Annex 6 Appendix: Estimated Recurrent Costs&#13;
DOMINICA&#13;
BASIC EDUCATION REFORM PROJECT&#13;
Estimate of Recurrent Costs Impact Generated by the Project&#13;
(excluding Debt service)&#13;
1.    Incremental annual recurrent costs would be generated by the project by the year 2000 in regard to:&#13;
(a)   new positions in the MOE Establishment including the library service and related travel and office and&#13;
general expenses;&#13;
(b)   increased allowances for materials and supplies and for operations and maintenance in primary and&#13;
secondary schools;&#13;
(c)   additional costs of maintaining the equipment and furniture supplied under the project,&#13;
(d)   the costs related to additional 735 secondary school places provided by the project comprising (i) teacher&#13;
salaries; (ii) non-teacher salaries; and (iii) non-salaries expenditure&#13;
(e)   cost of maintenance of the new office buildings ( the DEO office in Castle Bruce, MOE building and&#13;
Library building in Portsmouth); and&#13;
(f)   cost of supplies for the expanded SLS.&#13;
2.    The Appendix to Annex 3 sets out the recurrent cost implications of the adjustment of teacher to student&#13;
ratios and the transfer of savings to other purposes. As Table 4 of that Appendix shows, items listed in&#13;
paragmaph I above that are accommodated within the anticipated savings are: (a); (b);(d)(i);(d)(iii)&#13;
3.    Costs estimated for the items that have not been covered by the savings are as follows:&#13;
(1) non-teaching salaries at Castle Bruce Secondary -EC$48,000 and&#13;
(2) maintenance of new office and library equipment and furniture - EC$ 125,000&#13;
(3) maintenance of new office and library buildings - EC$270,000; and&#13;
(4) supplies for operating the expansion to School Library Service - EC$75,000&#13;
This total of EC$518,000 is offset by the excess of savings (EC$663,959 rising to $ 1,000,000) shown in Table 4&#13;
of the Appendix to Annex 3.&#13;
4.    Consequently, no net incremental recurrent cost is anticipated as a result of the project and the&#13;
adjustment program. As table 5 of the appendix to annex 3 shows, the MOE budget is expected to rise over the&#13;
project implementation period at a rate slower than that of the expected increase in the nationai budget and these&#13;
increases in the MOE budget are not attributable to the project.&#13;

MONITORING AND EVALUATION INDICATORS&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation (M &amp; E) will include both the achievement of specific targets and objectives&#13;
(mainly monitoring) and the realization of results or outcomes (more generally, evaluation). As there are no&#13;
precise indicators or benchmarks of quality and institutional development, imperfect and subjective indicators&#13;
will need to be used.&#13;

            Dominica - Basic Education Reform Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Basic Education Reform Project has
            the overall objective of accelerating human resource
            development to ensure that the requisite manpower exists to
            attain the desired economic transition in Dominica. The
            project is intended to: 1) strengthen the planning and
            institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, Youth
            Affairs and Sports (MOE) to guide and carry out the
            long-term development of the sector, while enabling it to
            initiate significant, urgent measures to address system-wide
            qualitative problems and expansion needs at the secondary
            level; and 2) serve as a catalyst for a major adjustment
            process, focused on revision to more reasonable levels of
            primary and secondary teacher to student ratios, in line
            with ratios of countries of comparable economic and social
            development. The project comprises three major components:
            1) a strengthening management and planning component; 2) a
            qualitative improvement of basic education component, which
            will enhance the quality of teaching and learning; and 3) an
            expansion and conservation of school places component, which
            will assist MOE to provide more secondary school places in
            the most under-served districts to reduce long distance
            travel and facilitate access to educational opportunities.
