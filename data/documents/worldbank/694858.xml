1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Government of China (GOC) has requested World Bank assistance in&#13;
financing an agricultural development project in Heilongjiang Province featuring the&#13;
introduction of new production and processing technologies and promoting the adoption&#13;
of a market oriented approach to agro-industry. The primary objectives of the project are&#13;
to raise incomes and living standards, stimulate market-oriented enterprise development,&#13;
and expand rural employment by increasing livestock and aquaculture production. The&#13;
project would support enhanced environmental standards in the design of crop and&#13;
livestock processing plants, develop monitoring systems and promote sound&#13;
environmental protection practices in the Songnen Plain, the main agricultural production&#13;
area in the province. The project was identified in October 1994, pre-appraised in May/&#13;
June 1996 and appraised in November/December 1996.&#13;
B. AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
1.2   General. Agriculture in China provides sustenance for about 1.2 billion people,&#13;
contributes approximately 20 percent to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and&#13;
is the main source of income for some 200 million farm families. An important trend&#13;
affecting the sector has been the shift from a command economy to a more market-driven&#13;
economy. This has occurred gradually, starting from the introduction of the household&#13;
responsibility system in 1978 and most recently, the introduction of the "socialist market&#13;
economy" concept in 1993. Enterprise reforms stressing increased management autonomy&#13;
and liberalized markets have led to a steady erosion of the old command system and have&#13;
impacted strongly on all links of the distribution chain-primary production, processing,&#13;
and marketing.  Small-scale crop and livestock producers, as well as agroindustrial&#13;
enterprises, are striving to adapt to an increasingly competitive and sophisticated consumer&#13;
market, and, at the same time, to maintain environmentally sustainable production practices.&#13;
1.3   The Livestock Sector. The country's livestock subsector has undergone rapid&#13;
growth during the past 15 years, in response to an increasing demand for livestock products&#13;
resulting from rising incomes, particularly in urban areas. This growth has been promoted&#13;
by the accelerating reallocation of grain supplies for livestock, rather than human&#13;
consumption, and the relative lack of state intervention. China's livestock sector has shown&#13;
impressive growth since the initiation of market reforms in 1978. In the last five years&#13;
alone (1991-95), livestock inventories showed average annual increases of 6.2 percent for&#13;
cattle, 3.6 percent for swine, and 6 percent for sheep and goats. This was accompanied by&#13;
productivity increases that led to average annual growth rates in meat production of 25&#13;
percent for cattle, 8.6 percent for swine and 12.3 percent for sheep and goats.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.4   China is continuing to encourage investment in livestock production and processing,&#13;
while introducing policies designed to increase the efficiency and international market&#13;
competitiveness of its livestock industry. This has led to substantial investment in vertically&#13;
integrated animal feed and livestock production and processing enterprises, particularly in&#13;
the poultry and pig sectors, as well as in dairying and, most recently, specialized beef&#13;
production. Such enterprises frequently make use of out-grower contracts for livestock&#13;
production, thus enabling small-scale producers to enjoy the financial benefits of&#13;
technology improvements and a degree of protection from market risks.&#13;
1.5   Fisheries Sector. In 1994, total production of aquatic products, which includes&#13;
both capture and culture production from freshwater and marine sources, reached 21.5&#13;
million tons and accounted for 8.2 percent of Gross Value of Agricultural Output. Annual&#13;
growth in fishery output has averaged about 17.2 percent over the period 1991 to 1994, with&#13;
mariculture recording the highest growth rate of 22.2 percent, followed by freshwater&#13;
aquaculture at 19.6 percent. China is now the world's largest producer of aquatic products.&#13;
Starting in the mid-1980s, the Government emphasized a production strategy to increase the&#13;
supply of fish in urban markets; this strategy was based on expanding the area of fish&#13;
cultivation on land unsuitable for crops (low-lying land in the interior and coastal areas),&#13;
utilizing more advanced technology and equipment for pond management, and introducing&#13;
higher-value species.&#13;
1.6   A breakdown of the production structure for 1994 indicates that marine capture&#13;
fisheries still provided the bulk of production (42 percent), followed by freshwater&#13;
aquaculture (37 percent), mariculture (16 percent) and freshwater capture (6 percent). Over&#13;
the 1991-94 period, there has been a gradual but noticeable trend of declining production in&#13;
the marine capture subsector and increasing production of mariculture and freshwater&#13;
aquaculture.&#13;
1.7   Agro-industry. Crop and livestock processing is undertaken by a combination of&#13;
state-owned enterprises (with ownership by provincial and county governments), township&#13;
and village enterprises (TVEs), and collectives. Since the introduction of reforms in 1978,&#13;
the value of goods produced by the nonstate sector has reportedly increased from 2 percent&#13;
of industrial output value to over 50 percent in 1994. TVEs were instrumental in creating&#13;
jobs and increasing incomes in the rural areas during the 1980s. Many TVEs arc run&#13;
without enterprise autonomy, answering to and controlled by local government leaders.&#13;
The proliferation of TVEs has presented many environmental problems because they are&#13;
usually small-scale industries, utilizing low technology and with little money for adequate&#13;
waste treatment facilities, commonly discharging their untreated industrial waste into the&#13;
countryside. Their financial condition is not jeopardized by providing social services&#13;
(pensions, medical care, housing), but they are frequently undercapitalized with earnings&#13;
quickly withdrawn by the local government to be invested elsewhere or meet other financial&#13;
obligations.&#13;
1.8   State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China are collectively profitable, though beset by&#13;
widespread financial, technical and managerial problems (see "China: Reform of State-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Owned Enterprises, Report No. 14924-CHA, in process). As a group, industrial SOEs&#13;
report operating profits of about 2 percent of GDP, but about 40 percent of SOEs incurred&#13;
losses amounting to about 1 percent of GDP. As a result, after-tax profits finance only a&#13;
small share of their investments and SOEs use a disproportionately large portion of&#13;
available credit which generally, is used less productively than in the nonstate sector.&#13;
Several policy-related distortions depress the financial performance of SOEs: the tax&#13;
regime imposes a heavier burden of taxation, primarily because of tax exemptions given to&#13;
foreign-funded nonstate enterprises (this has been discontinued in 1996); price controls&#13;
depress earnings of coal, natural gas, fertilizer and grain producers, and these sectors have&#13;
recorded substantial losses; providing social services for workers and retirees-education,&#13;
health, pensions-imposes tremendous financial cost; and limited autonomy to release&#13;
redundant workers leads to inefficiencies and higher production costs.&#13;
C. THE RURAL ECONOMY IN HEILONGJIANG&#13;
1.9   The Pattern of Development in the Province. Heilongjiang contains 10 percent&#13;
of China's arable land; it has the largest area of cultivated land per capita, and is a major&#13;
producer of cereals and the largest producer of soybeans. The Daqing Oil Field accounts&#13;
for 46 percent of China's known petroleum reserves; substantial mineral deposits have been&#13;
identified and many are under intensive exploitation. With such resources, it would seem&#13;
paradoxical that the province has historically posed difficult economic and social&#13;
development challenges. Large-scale state enterprises were established to exploit natural&#13;
resources and provide urban employment during the peak of the centrally-planned&#13;
economic period, and state farms were established in remote areas to develop new lands,&#13;
secure border areas, and provide grain and animal products to distant urban centers and to&#13;
large high-priority SOEs. These large state investments in industry and agriculture, buoyed&#13;
by protected markets and subsidized capital, became prominent features of the provincial&#13;
economy. Production and incomes from those enterprises masked the problems associated&#13;
with the poor condition of many enterprises that were outside this privileged system. The&#13;
dependence on large SOEs, the difficulties attendant to their reform, and the delayed&#13;
development of other segments of agriculture, industry and local government lie at the heart&#13;
of the income and employment difficulties that are now of growing concern to central and&#13;
provincial authorities.&#13;
1.10  Industry. As a result of state investments, the industrial sector today contributes&#13;
about 58 percent of provincial GDP, exceeding the national average of 48 percent, as well&#13;
as the share of all regions other than the two most advanced coastal areas. Per capita&#13;
income from industry exceeds the national average by 37 percent. But industry in&#13;
Heilongjiang, even more than in other provinces, is highly concentrated both geographically&#13;
and in terms of number of enterprises. Beyond the large SOEs in energy and basic industry,&#13;
processing and manufacturing in the province are characterized by small-scale isolated units&#13;
serving local markets and cut off from outside sources of capital, technology and markets.&#13;
There has been very little integration or specialization of enterprises in this sector, and&#13;
supporting services have been poor. Enterprises at the county level and below, whether&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
state-owned, collective or private, survived only with the stability of protected local markets&#13;
and the absence of competition or technological innovation.&#13;
1.11  Agriculture. Heilongjiang covers an area of 45.5 million hectares (ha), of which&#13;
about 20 percent is cultivated (8.9 million ha). Agriculture employs 55 percent of the total&#13;
population (20.3 million out of 36.4 million). Here again, there are two patterns of&#13;
development, with 78 percent of the cultivated land in the hands of small holders (92&#13;
percent of the agricultural population) and 22 percent in 108 large state farms (8 percent of&#13;
the agricultural population). The major crops are cereal grains (mainly corn, wheat, and&#13;
rice, occupying 4.3 million ha) and soybeans (occupying 2.8 million ha). Compared to the&#13;
national average, yields of wheat and rice are somewhat lower, but yields of corn and&#13;
soybeans are 24 percent and 6 percent higher, respectively. The province is a major&#13;
producer of flax, supplying nearly 90 percent of national production, and sugarbeet&#13;
(26 percent of national production). With 236,000 square kilometers (km2) of forest area, it&#13;
also contributes substantially to national production of timber (19 percent) and sawn lumber&#13;
(26 percent). The harsh climate, great distances and relatively low population density have&#13;
contributed to a fragmented pattern of agricultural and rural development outside the state&#13;
farms.&#13;
1.12  Livestock. The province has a vast natural grassland resource extending over 6&#13;
million ha (13.2 percent of the total area). The combination of grain surpluses, pasture&#13;
availability, and experience nurtured by the livestock husbandry tradition of the farmers,&#13;
provides a substantial potential for livestock development. The livestock population in&#13;
1995 included 11.4 million pigs, of which 1.04 million were sows; 5.1 million cattle, of&#13;
which 0.85 million were dairy cattle; 4.9 million sheep and goats and 25 million geese. In&#13;
1995, the total meat production in Heilongjiang was 1.35 million tons, of which red meat&#13;
constituted about 80 percent. The province also produced 278,000 tons of poultry meat (20&#13;
percent of total meat production) from an offtake of 120 million birds and 790,000 tons of&#13;
eggs in the same period. Heilongjiang is also a major milk producer with an output of 1.66&#13;
million tons-more than a quarter of the national production; most of this is processed into&#13;
dry whole-milk powder. The livestock sector accounted for 9 percent of the gross value of&#13;
provincial production and 27 percent of the value of provincial agricultural production.&#13;
1.13  Fisheries. Based solely on freshwater sources, Heilongjiang produced 253,000 tons&#13;
of aquatic products in 1995, about 1 percent of national production. Of this amount, about&#13;
80 percent was from freshwater culture and the balance from capture fisheries. Consumers&#13;
rely on interprovincial supplies of frozen freshwater and marine fish. Despite a limited&#13;
growing season due to harsh climatic conditions, it has been shown that appropriate pond&#13;
design and management technology adapted to a limited growing season and protected&#13;
overwintering lead to financially viable fishery culture.&#13;
D. CURRENT CHALLENGES IN AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY&#13;
1.14  Despite the shift of policy to a socialist market economy, the strategic importance of&#13;
the province's SOEs was such that the central governmnent continued to support them well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
into the period when reforms were taking hold in other parts of the country. After 1988, the&#13;
increasing scarcity of central government resources for investment in the province forced a&#13;
slow-down in the inefficient operations of the large SOE's with an indirect impact on other&#13;
enterprises that served these core activities with raw materials and intermediate products.&#13;
Furthermore, since incomes and savings in the province were closely tied to the well-being&#13;
of these enterprises, and of the state farm sector, the private and local government&#13;
investment pool that stimulated production in other regions was not forthcoming to the&#13;
same degree in Heilongjiang. The result has been a slowdown in economic growth over the&#13;
past eight years, and a deterioration in economic performance relative to coastal regions.&#13;
1.15  TVEs and their county-level counterparts, developed in Heilongjiang, as elsewhere,&#13;
but their access to technology and capital was even more limited, and they tended to focus&#13;
much of their production and marketing on the SOEs and urban populations, which are now&#13;
in difficulty. The lack of market contact outside the region insulated management from the&#13;
pressure to modernize that forced TVEs elsewhere to go through periods of adjustment&#13;
since the initial growth in the 1980s. Technology and products are increasingly obsolete&#13;
and cost structures noncompetitive. Specific problem areas include declining sales volume,&#13;
rising operating costs, low quality production, insolvency, unrealistic asset values, low&#13;
creditworthiness, and poor accounting and management information systems.&#13;
1.16 Local government institutions have not developed the strength or experience in&#13;
planning and management to the same degree as other provinces that have enjoyed greater&#13;
autonomy in the past. Past subordination to central agencies on critical investment and&#13;
management decisions in the state sector deprived them not only of the learning experience,&#13;
but also the resources and administrative capacity that might serve them well in today's&#13;
adjustment tasks. Support institutions such as financial intermediaries and training centers&#13;
have been held back in their own development by the predominance of old-style state&#13;
enterprise demand for their services. To respond to these conditions, the Province has&#13;
begun to promote enterprise reform.&#13;
E. THE CURRENT STATUS OF ENTERPRISE REFORM&#13;
1.17  Three provincial SOEs were selected to participate in a nationwide 100 enterprise&#13;
reform program-the Jiamusi Paper Mill, Hualin Rubber Group (tires), and Acheng&#13;
Petrochemical Industrial Corporation (textiles). These enterprises have output in the range&#13;
of Y 200-300 million. The objective of reform for these enterprises is to achieve clear&#13;
definition of property ownership and obligations and rights, separation of ownership and&#13;
management, and modern management methods. In line with the central government&#13;
reform program, the provincial government has selected 30 enterprises to demonstrate&#13;
enterprise reform; however, only two of these are agroprocessing enterprises-Zhaodong&#13;
State Grain Storage and Heilongjiang Longjiang Soybean Corporation. The provincial&#13;
government is encouraging all SOEs to organize and operate as limited liability companies&#13;
in line with the Company Law, with boards of directors and autonomous management. In&#13;
the past, it was necessary for applications for reorganization as limited liability companies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
to be reviewed and approved by the provincial government; now, the only requirement is&#13;
registration at the county level or above with the Industry and Commerce Bureau.&#13;
1.18  Heilongjiang has about 625,000 TVEs in operation employing 2.1 million persons.&#13;
About 600,000 of these are individual households or joint household operations (mostly&#13;
small restaurants and shops), but the remaining 25,000 are collectively-owned village or&#13;
township operations. The reform target for the province is to turn these 25,000 enterprises&#13;
into limited liability companies by the year 2000. Some 365 of these enterprises have&#13;
annual sales &gt;Y 10 million; 184 enterprises are processing agricultural products or&#13;
byproducts. Most TVEs joined the provincial social security system in 1994 and generally&#13;
do not provide housing. The reform measures will concentrate on separation of ownership&#13;
and management and introduction of accounting standards. The Chang An Paper Mill&#13;
(Qiqihar) has been performing well in these measures, and the provincial TVE&#13;
Administration Bureau has endeavored to publicize its experience.&#13;
1.19 The companies applying to become sub-borrowers under the proposed project have&#13;
all begun significant enterprise reforms.  During project preparation, agro-industry&#13;
subprojects sponsors had been stimulated by the provincial government to arrange for&#13;
establishing and registering proposed project enterprises as limited liability companies, with&#13;
ownership divided between the state, employees, raw material suppliers, distributors and&#13;
other private shareholders. Three of the subprojects are completely in the hands of the&#13;
private sector, two as limited liability companies and one as a sole proprietorship, with no&#13;
state (neither provincial, county or township) participation whatsoever. It should be noted&#13;
that enterprises at the county level or below, which include almost all proposed sub-&#13;
borrowers, do not face the heavy social burdens or large payrolls that make reform among&#13;
larger SOEs so difficult. Even where project sponsors are one or more SOEs, the new&#13;
subprojects are being spun off as independent limited liability companies with diversified&#13;
ownership and carry none of the social burdens of the sponsors.&#13;
F. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.20  Country Assistance Strategy. As discussed with the Bank's Board on March 18,&#13;
1997, the Bank Group's objectives are to help China to continue achieving macroeconomic&#13;
stability within the context of healthy-and efficient-growth, and to sustain this growth by&#13;
helping to ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to priority areas that are not funded&#13;
adequately at present. The broad strategy is to underpin five key areas of focus, which&#13;
include: support for implementation of macroeconomic and structural reforms (particularly&#13;
SOE reform, financial sector reform, and fiscal reform); alleviation of infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks; human development (including poverty reduction and development of the&#13;
social sectors); protection of the environment; and development of agriculture and the rural&#13;
economy.&#13;
1.21  The key issue for the focus on agriculture and the rural economy is that agriculture&#13;
and the rural sector are contributing less to the overall economy, as performance lagged&#13;
behind other sectors in recent years, and as a result, rural incomes have grown much more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
slowly than urban incomes. This contributes to sharpening income disparities between the&#13;
coastal and rural provinces, as well as increasing rural-urban migration. Through the Ninth&#13;
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), China has set the agriculture sector at the top of its economic&#13;
agenda, with four goals: to achieve greater self-sufficiency in grain (with production rising&#13;
to 490-500 million tons by the year 2000); to raise farmers' standard of living; making&#13;
better use of technology and speeding up the development of nearby industries that use&#13;
agricultural products; and to eliminate poverty.&#13;
1.22  Recently, rural-urban migration has increased dramatically due to the surplus rural&#13;
labor force and higher growth rates in the coastal areas. More men migrate to the cities, and&#13;
agriculture is increasingly left in the hands of women. To account for this development,&#13;
agricultural projects will need to target women for training and extension. The Bank&#13;
Group's strategy in agriculture recognizes that China has made progress in liberalizing its&#13;
policy and price structure, but more needs to be done. Key sector institutions need to be&#13;
reformed further, while allowing the nonstate sector to play a greater role in production and&#13;
distribution. In particular, improved cooperation and joint ventures among farmers,&#13;
breeders, processors, and distributors can result in improved productivity, higher quality,&#13;
and greater efficiency. A major thrust of the Bank Group's assistance strategy is to&#13;
accelerate commercialization of the agriculture sector and to assist local governments to&#13;
develop new income-generation programs (including TVEs) in lagging provinces. In this&#13;
case, the program by the Heilongjiang Provincial Government to stimulate reform of&#13;
management and ownership patterns in rural industry was directly stimulated by project&#13;
identification in October 1994. It was broadened during project preparation, and it is hoped&#13;
that successful implementation will provide a powerful demonstration of benefits of&#13;
enterprise reform throughout Heilongjiang.&#13;
1.23  The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy as outlined&#13;
above and the goals set out in China's Ninth Five-Year Plan. It is a pilot effort in a&#13;
province that has only recently initiated the reforms, which led to entrepreneurial&#13;
development, and it would extend to agro-industry the reforms that have thus far been&#13;
focused mainly on industry outside the agricultural sector. While the livestock activities&#13;
envisaged under the project require a level of technical ability and resource contribution that&#13;
would preclude targeting the absolute poor, most of the incremental labor demand in&#13;
livestock production would be satisfied from available household labor, which is grossly&#13;
underutilized. Women would be targeted to receive training in livestock and aquaculture&#13;
activities. In addition, the establishment and expansion of agroprocessing facilities will&#13;
create a significant employment expansion for skilled and unskilled labor and furthers the&#13;
integration of breeders, producers and processors of livestock products. The proposed&#13;
project supports environmental protection with its attention to sustainable pasture&#13;
management practices for livestock production and investment in pollution control&#13;
measures for agroprocessing operations. While the effluent from most agroprocessing&#13;
activities is usually not difficult to treat, simple treatment measures such as outdoor ponds&#13;
and tanks are ineffective in Heilongjiang's severe winter conditions unless enclosed under&#13;
cover. In the proposed project, particular emphasis has been placed on incorporating waste&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
minimization and appropriate treatment of gaseous and liquid waste, and increasing&#13;
industrial efficiency of energy use.&#13;
1.24  Finally, like many recent Bank lending operations, it touches upon issues related to&#13;
enterprise efficiency by adopting for project enterprises the key principles for enterprise&#13;
reform: creation of autonomous corporate enterprises with modem financial accounts;&#13;
separation of the provision of social services from enterprises; and promotion of greater&#13;
flexibility in ownership to facilitate enterprise restructuring through acquisition of new&#13;
technologies, management expertise, and financing sources.&#13;
G. PAST BANK SUPPORT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.25  A review by the Bank's Operation Evaluation Department (OED) of area&#13;
development projects, published in September 1995, identified a number of project design&#13;
elements critical to successful project implementation. The proposed project is consistent&#13;
with the recommendations relating to commitment, phased approach, simplicity of design&#13;
and integration of components. For example, a common element of success in area&#13;
development projects in China has been the degree of government commitment. Both the&#13;
central and provincial governments have supported the proposed project and have&#13;
mobilized support down to the county and township levels. There is a high degree of&#13;
support and interest on the part of project beneficiaries and stakeholders, particularly the&#13;
owners of the enterprises, many of whom are workers and farmers producing the&#13;
agricultural inputs.&#13;
1.26  In addition, the recommendations of recent Implementation Completion Reports of&#13;
China agricultural projects (Shandong Agricultural Development Project Report No. 15308&#13;
and Xinjiang Agricultural Development Project Report No. 15439) have been incorporated&#13;
into preparation of the proposed project. Designs and cost estimates for all agroprocessing&#13;
facilities include wastewater treatment systems.  Technical experts, including an&#13;
environmental engineer, have actively participated with the Chinese design institutes on the&#13;
selection of appropriate agroprocessing equipment. Finally, local consultants have been&#13;
engaged to conduct a marketing study for all of the products produced by the supported&#13;
facilities. This study will lead to detailed marketing plans for all of the commodities.&#13;
1.27  The Heilongjiang Land Reclamation Project (Ln. 2261/Cr. 1347-CHA), one of the&#13;
Bank's earliest efforts in China, was implemented between 1983 and 1988 by the&#13;
Heilongjiang General Bureau, which was technically a part of the provincial government,&#13;
but was also responsible to the Central General Bureau of State Farms and Land&#13;
Reclamation in the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fishery. The project&#13;
objective was to reduce China's growing foodgrain deficit and to increase the supply of&#13;
marketable surplus grain for sale to the urban population, to provide experience in&#13;
upgrading mechanized crop production, and serve as a model for development of&#13;
uncultivated land in the project. Implementation featured the development of 200,000 ha&#13;
of virgin land on state farms in the province for production of wheat, maize and soybeans.&#13;
The Project Performance Audit Report attributed the project's satisfactory results to strong&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
borrower commitment; favorable policy framework; introduction of the Production&#13;
Responsibility System; and well-proven technology using improved foreign-manufactured&#13;
equipment, previously tested and found adaptable to local conditions.&#13;
1.28  Harbin, the provincial capital, was one of eight cities participating in the Freshwater&#13;
Fisheries Project (Cr. 1689-CHA) implemented between 1986 and 1992. The objective of&#13;
the project was to develop freshwater fisheries in the vicinity of eight major urban centers&#13;
by improving existing ponds and using land unsuitable for crops for new pond construction,&#13;
provide techniques and equipment for pond management, and strengthen the support&#13;
facilities for production and marketing of fish. In the vicinity of Harbin, 1,333 ha of new&#13;
ponds were constructed and 333 ha of existing ponds were reconstructed. In the Project&#13;
Completion Report, the project was regarded as highly successful, and the main reasons&#13;
were attributed to a simple design of the project, subprojects were relatively accessible,&#13;
strong sense of ownership and commitment by the implementing agencies and local&#13;
governments, speedy implementation with "construction and production in the same year,"&#13;
and training provided early in the implementation period. The project has not been audited&#13;
by OED.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
A. LOCATION&#13;
2.1   The proposed project would be located in Heilongjiang Province, the far&#13;
northeastern province of China, which takes its name from the river forming its northern&#13;
border, the Heilongjiang, which is one of the world's great rivers. The province is bordered&#13;
by Nei Mongol Autonomous Region in the west, Russia in the north and east and Jilin&#13;
Province in the south. Two major tributaries of the Heilongjiang are the Songhua, which&#13;
flows across the province, and the Wusili, which forms its eastern border. The project&#13;
would cover 33 counties of six prefectures/municipalities with a total area of about&#13;
140,000 km2 located in the Songnen Plain in the southwest and west-central part of the&#13;
province. Project locations are shown on IBRD Map 28204. Background provincial and&#13;
project area statistics are given in Annex 1, Table 1.&#13;
B. CLIMATE, TOPOGRAPHY AND SOILS&#13;
2.2   The project area has a temperate-to-cold monsoonal continental climate. Winter is&#13;
long, cold and dry and is followed by dry and windy conditions in spring. Summer is warm&#13;
and rainy, with most precipitation occurring in the summer and autumn months. The&#13;
average temperature varies from about -20°C in January, with an absolute low of -40°C, to&#13;
+220C in July, with an absolute high of +38°C. Average annual precipitation is 450 to&#13;
550 millimeters (mm) and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days. Average wind speed is&#13;
3 to 4 meters/second (m/s) with a maximum wind speed of 30 to 40 m/s, occurring&#13;
primarily in the spring. The area enjoys a long period of sunshine with strong solar&#13;
radiation. May to September sunshine amounts to about 1,350 hours. Annual solar&#13;
2&#13;
radiation is 125-130 kilocalories/square centimeter (cm ), with about 60 kilocalories/cm2&#13;
from May to September; this is essentially the same as in the middle and lower reaches of&#13;
the Yangtze River Valley.&#13;
2.3   Most of the project area is flat to rolling plain with areas of swamps and marshes,&#13;
especially along the rivers. The land slopes to the northeast with low mountains along the&#13;
south, southeast and western borders. The principal soil types in the project area are&#13;
meadow soils, black soils, and black/brown soils, which together account for about 80&#13;
percent of the total. These soils are deep loams or clay loams, with good physical&#13;
properties, relatively high organic matter content (5-8 percent) and good nutrient status, and&#13;
are among the most productive soils in China. Smaller scattered areas of much less fertile&#13;
soils comprise sandy soils, and saline and alkaline soils with impeded drainage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
C. POPULATION, FARM SIZE AND LAND USE&#13;
2.4   The rural population in the project area is 12.5 million, of which about 82 percent&#13;
obtain their livelihood from agriculture. There are some 2.75 million farm families in the&#13;
project area, with an average family size of 4.5 persons. The average farm size is about&#13;
2 ha, of which about 1.6 ha is cultivated. Out of a total project area of 14 million ha, there&#13;
are about 6 million ha of arable land, most of which is used for grain production. Some&#13;
2.85 million ha are classified as forest including shelter belts and farm border plantings, and&#13;
there are 2.2 million ha of grassland of variable quality.&#13;
D. PRESENT DEVELOPMENT&#13;
2.5   Agriculture. Most of the land in the project area is managed by individual&#13;
households. The cultivated area is about 4.6 million ha but, because of the short growing&#13;
season, generally only one crop a year is grown. Corn and soybean are the main crops,&#13;
accounting for more than 50 percent of the cropped area in 1995, and producing 10.8&#13;
million tons and 1.07 million tons respectively with average yields of 5.8 tons/ha (corn) and&#13;
1.7 tons/ha (soybean). Other grain crops grown include spring wheat, paddy rice, sorghum&#13;
and millet, which in 1995 yielded a total of 7 million tons of grain. Sugar beet and potatoes&#13;
are the main root crops grown. Flax is a small but significant crop in the project area,&#13;
producing about 62,000 tons of fiber annually and accounting for 75 percent of the&#13;
province's flax crop. Heilongjiang produces nearly 90 percent of the flax grown in China.&#13;
Cultivation is done mostly by small tractors or draft animals including horses, mules and&#13;
cattle.&#13;
2.6   Livestock. The farm livestock population in the project area in 1995 included 3.36&#13;
million cattle, 8.06 million pigs, 3.6 million sheep and goats and 100 million poultry. In&#13;
1995, the project area produced more than 1 million tons of meat and 1.24 million tons of&#13;
milk. Cattle are kept mainly for beef and as draft animals. Breeding is mostly by artificial&#13;
insemination (Al) and more than 50 percent of all cattle are crossbred to Simmental,&#13;
Charolais and Limousine bulls for beef production. Beef producers may be specialized&#13;
breeders and/or fatteners. Calves are weaned at about 7 months weighing 140-160 kg and&#13;
then fattened over 11-12 months to about 425 kg for sale to traders, abattoirs or specialized&#13;
household butcheries.&#13;
2.7   There is a significant dairy industry in the project area with 694,000 cows, mostly&#13;
under individual household management, and accounting for about 70 percent of the&#13;
provincial dairy herd. Dairy cows are predominantly Friesian of European or Canadian&#13;
origin. Heifers calve at about 2.5 years old and calving intervals are about 14 months.&#13;
Average annual milk yields are 3,500-4,000 liters. Most of the fresh milk is supplied to&#13;
local processing plants for processing into powdered milk products.&#13;
2.8   Few small-scale beef or dairy farmers use commercially mixed feeds, preferning&#13;
home-produced or locally purchased grain, crop residues, including ammoniated straw and&#13;
corn stover, silage, and the extensive use of agroindustrial by-products, particularly&#13;
brewers' and distillers' wastes, which are widely available. Hay is cut and stored for winter&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
feeding. Cattle are grazed or stall-fed depending on the availability of pasture. There is&#13;
scope to improve the quality of feed through wider adoption of urea-treated stover fed in&#13;
combination with soybean and sunflower oilseed cake, and through the introduction of&#13;
better silage and hay-making techniques.&#13;
2.9   Most grassland is located in areas with saline or alkaline soils and is frequently&#13;
overgrazed and degraded. Pasture yields are low, typically less than 1.5-2 tons dry matter&#13;
(DM) per ha per year, although about 0.5 million ha of natural pasture has been improved&#13;
through the introduction of alfalfa and salt- and alkali-tolerant grass species. The Provincial&#13;
Government is now introducing a new policy of long-term pasture lease to private farmers.&#13;
Under the new "Contract and Development Plan of the Grassland Resource," farmers, either&#13;
individually or collectively, will be eligible to lease state and collectively-owned pasture&#13;
land for periods of at least 30 and up to 50 years. Lease prices will be set by land quality,&#13;
location and market demand. Lease payments will be directed to special accounts, with up&#13;
to 80 percent of the income to be reinvested in pasture research and development and the&#13;
balance used to administer the scheme. Government is planning to convert most available&#13;
grassland to long-term leasehold by 1998/1999. Adoption of this plan should lead to a&#13;
reduction in overgrazing and improved grassland management. Pasture productivity is&#13;
expected to increase to 2.25 tons DM per ha by the year 2000, and to 3 ton per ha by 2010.&#13;
2.10 Pig breeding is based primarily on crossbreeding the highly fecund indigenous&#13;
Northeast China Black with exotic breeds, mostly the Yorkshire White or Landrace in order&#13;
to attain a large litter of pigs with medium levels of fat deposition. However, pure exotic&#13;
herds are increasing, in response to urban demand for leaner pork. Most pig fattening is&#13;
done by smallholder farmers typically in lots of 1-5 pigs utilizing low-cost household waste,&#13;
crop residues and agroindustrial by-products. Commercial mineral-vitamin-amino acid&#13;
supplements are frequently added to farm-mixed feeds. Pigs are fattened to market weight&#13;
(100 kg) in 6-12 months after weaning, depending on the quality of feed and the standard of&#13;
management.&#13;
2.11   Geese production is primarily a smallholder activity. Geese-rearing households&#13;
typically maintain 10 to 15 breeding stock and/or up to 200 growers for slaughter. Goslings&#13;
are hatched between April and June, and sold by breeders at 1-5 days old. Eggs are also&#13;
traded on the free market for both consumption and as fertilized eggs for hatching.&#13;
Goslings are fed a mix of chopped grass and corn meal for the first month, after which they&#13;
are grazed daily and fed a corn meal or other concentrate feed supplement. Finished birds&#13;
weighing 3.5 to 4 kg at 5-6 months are slaughtered in October/November. Breeding stock&#13;
are culled at 3 years of age.&#13;
2.12 Animal health is generally good. The incidence of major livestock disease is&#13;
extremely low as reflected in overall annual mortality rates, which are less than 1 percent&#13;
for cattle, swine and sheep and about 2 percent in poultry flocks. Population incidence of&#13;
major diseases of cattle include Tuberculosis (&lt;2 percent), Rinderpest (&lt;0.1 percent),&#13;
Leptospirosis (&lt;1 percent), and subclinical mastitis (8-9 percent). There is no incidence of&#13;
Foot and Mouth Disease, Leucosis, Blackleg, or Paratuberculosis. In pigs, the incidence of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
swine fever is low and erysipelas is low (both &lt;0.1 percent) and is well controlled through a&#13;
widespread vaccination program. Similarly, in poultry, Newcastle Disease and Goose&#13;
Plague are prevented through comprehensive vaccination programs. Overall, the low level&#13;
of disease, particularly enzootic disease, the extensive vaccination program and full cost&#13;
recovery for almost all vaccination services provides a sustainable, low animal disease&#13;
environment in Heilongjiang.&#13;
2.13  Livestock Support Services are provided through a network of Animal Husbandry&#13;
Bureau offices at provincial, prefecture, county, township and village level. In the project&#13;
area there are 39 city and county livestock technical service centers, 630 township&#13;
comprehensive service centers and 2,738 village technical service points. Village and&#13;
township centers are remarkably entrepreneurial and frequently profitable with income&#13;
derived from service fees and veterinary drug sales. In some cases, the cost of services is&#13;
recovered through annual poll charges. At county level and above, animal husbandry&#13;
centers are mostly government-funded, in line with their increasingly administrative&#13;
function. While existing staff and basic facilities are adequate to cope with the proposed&#13;
expansion of livestock production under the project, fully effective extension services are&#13;
constrained by inadequate funding for staff training and transportation.&#13;
2.14  The animal production and veterinary field services are supported by a group of&#13;
specialized agencies. The Animal Breeding Center, which maintains about 87 bulls,&#13;
provides semen of dairy and beef cattle breeds for artificial insemination. The Provincial&#13;
Feed and Pharmaceutical Supervision Institute is responsible, inter alia, for quality control&#13;
of commercial feed, and feed additives. The Province has 126 county-level feed mills and&#13;
36 feed additive plants. In 1994, some 928 product samples were tested at the Institute, of&#13;
which 85 percent met national standards. The Institute can provide basic feed analytical&#13;
services sufficient to meet the needs of the project. Some additional equipment has recently&#13;
been provided under the ongoing IDA-financed Agricultural Support Services Project&#13;
(ASSP-Cr. 2462-CHA). The Provincial Veterinary Sanitation and Epidemiological&#13;
Station is responsible for disease surveillance and for developing cost-effective disease&#13;
control strategies. Support for this station is also provided under ASSP.&#13;
2.15  Relevant research institutes in the project area include the Grasslands Research&#13;
Center, which is working on pasture improvement, and the Animal Science Department of&#13;
the Northeast Agricultural University, located in Harbin, which has a diverse livestock&#13;
research program including work on breed conservation, animal nutrition, fowl breeding,&#13;
pasture improvement and biotechnology. The Breeding and Genetics Branch is capable and&#13;
interested to support the project goose selection and breeding programs, which would be&#13;
implemented by the Provincial Animal Husbandry Breeding Center, in Qiqihar County.&#13;
2.16 Aquaculture. Total fish production in the province in 1994 was about 208,000&#13;
tons, of which about 76 percent was cultured carp raised in ponds, lakes and reservoirs. The&#13;
province produces a surplus of fingerlings and has adequate facilities for producing feed but&#13;
fish yields are low, averaging only 1,800 kilograms/ha (kg/ha) in ponds and 160 kg/ha in&#13;
lakes and reservoirs. Increased productivity is constrained by lack of credit, poorly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
designed ponds, low standards of management including low stocking rates, and inadequate&#13;
maintenance. Ponds are frequently dug too shallow or are allowed to silt up, making it&#13;
difficult to keep fish over the winter when the ponds ice over.&#13;
2.17  Livestock Processing. Meat production in the province totaled 1.3 million tons in&#13;
1995-with pork accounting for 59 percent of production, beef 18 percent, poultry 21&#13;
percent and mutton 2 percent. Production is carried out by township and village abattoirs&#13;
(29 percent), privately-owned abattoirs (27 percent), the Provincial Foodstuff Corporation,&#13;
which provides technological oversight to 80 county- and city-level abattoirs and cold&#13;
stores (9 percent), other SOEs (11 percent) and farmers (25 percent, for their own&#13;
consumption). Most of the meat going into the urban market goes through the Provincial&#13;
Foodstuff Corporation, particularly since a State Council ban on household slaughter. Meat&#13;
processing, mainly cooked meat and sausage production, is carried out by some 221 SOEs,&#13;
250 collectives, 76 TVEs and 364 "other" for whom the Public Health Department monitors&#13;
sanitary conditions.&#13;
2.18  Grain Processing.  The provincial Grain Bureau, which is administratively&#13;
responsible for 313 enterprises (rice and corn processing, wheat flour, vegetable oil,&#13;
alcohol, starch), processes about 70 percent of grain production, with the balance processed&#13;
by TVEs (10 percent), State Farm enterprises (&lt;10 percent) and others, i.e., Army farms,&#13;
Foreign Trade Corporation, Bureau of Light Industry (13 percent). These enterprises had a&#13;
total output of Y 3.6 billion in 1995 and employed about 55,000 people. Most of them are&#13;
SOEs, though a small number are collectives and about 15 percent are organized as&#13;
shareholding companies or joint ventures. Of these enterprises, 292 enterprises have the&#13;
status of legal entities, are financially autonomous and operate independently; 21 are&#13;
considered as subsidiaries to other enterprises.&#13;
2.19 Transport and Power Supply. Project area communications benefit from having&#13;
the Daqing oil field located at its center. Four railway lines and three main highways&#13;
connect the main cities and towns with the provincial capital. This network is accessible to&#13;
virtually all project processing plants. There are adequate secondary and tertiary roads&#13;
linking smaller towns and villages serving crop, livestock and fish production bases. The&#13;
provincial power grid serves the project area and provides access to electricity to all towns&#13;
and some villages. However, it will be necessary to supplement or extend the power supply&#13;
to a number of project sites.&#13;
E. WOMEN IN THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
2.20 The All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) in Heilongjiang, as in other provinces&#13;
throughout China, is active in addressing women's issues. By law, women have equal right&#13;
to employment in enterprises, although they are banned from working with poisonous&#13;
substances and physically heavy labor. Enterprises are also required by law to provide&#13;
mothers three months' paid leave after childbirth and many give an additional month of&#13;
leave before the expected birth. Private nurseries, regulated by the Education Commission,&#13;
and babysitters (generally older, retired women in the neighborhood) are increasingly the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
alternatives to company-provided day care. As in many other inland provinces, increasing&#13;
numbers of men have found employment in towns and cities and left farming activities in&#13;
the hands of rural women. As a result, more than 50 percent of rural household income is&#13;
provided by women, predominantly from livestock activities. In rural areas, ACWF takes a&#13;
role in providing training in rural technology to women and organizing them to participate&#13;
in training offered by other agencies. An important source of training for some 30,000 rural&#13;
women in the province has been the Agriculture Broadcasting University, which includes&#13;
one-month residence at a local university; more than 12,000 have received farmer&#13;
technician certificates and about 600 have become agro-engineer assistants through this&#13;
program. Because project livestock activities are mainly carried out by women, they are&#13;
being targeted for project-sponsored training in livestock and in aquaculture.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The primary objectives of the project are to raise incomes and living standards,&#13;
stimulate market-oriented enterprise development in rural Heilongjiang industries, and&#13;
expand rural employment by increasing livestock and aquaculture production and&#13;
expanding or improving crop and livestock processing. The project would introduce new&#13;
production and processing technologies, ani promote better planning and management to&#13;
respond to market demands. It would also enhance environmental standards in the design&#13;
of crop and livestock processing plants, develop monitoring systems and promote sound&#13;
environmental protection practices.&#13;
3.2   Project monitoring indicators (Table 3.1) would focus on the livestock and&#13;
aquaculture development under farm household management and expansion and&#13;
improvement of agroprocessing, including enterprise reform measures. Development of the&#13;
indicators is based on the assumption that the project implementation will be carried out&#13;
over a five-year period and the subloans for livestock and aquaculture will be extended for&#13;
six years, including two years' grace, and for agroprocessing, nine years, including three&#13;
years' grace. The major risks to achieving both project implementation and development&#13;
objectives lie in inadequate counterpart funding and slippage in procurement of major&#13;
processing equipment.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.3   The main features of the project are:&#13;
(a)   expansion of livestock raising including cattle, pigs, geese and fox;&#13;
(b)   aquaculture, including expansion and improvement of facilities for carp&#13;
polyculture;&#13;
(c)   agroprocessing, including construction of new  and expansion and&#13;
improvement of existing facilities for processing milk, beef, pigs and geese,&#13;
cereals, oilseeds, beans and fruit; and&#13;
(d)   institutional development, including strengthening of livestock and crop&#13;
supporting services, technical assistance and training.&#13;

C. DETAILED FEATURES&#13;
Livestock&#13;
3.4   Cattle Fattening. About 7,200 farm families in 22 counties would fatten between&#13;
10 and 20 cattle annually. Young stock for fattening would be supplied from the provincial&#13;
cattle herd of 5.1 million head, which is growing at 5-8 percent per year, and from an&#13;
increasingly active livestock trading market that draws stock from neighboring provinces to&#13;
feed-rich Heilongjiang. Cattle would be purchased at 7-12 months of age weighing 160-&#13;
180 kg and fattened to an average weight of about 425 kg at 18-24 months old. Feed&#13;
rations would include corn silage, grass hay, corn (grain), brewers waste, soybean cake and&#13;
vitamin/mineral additives. The project would finance, on credit, the initial supply of young&#13;
stock, construction of a cattle shed, feed store, and silage pit and provision of a hand cart&#13;
and a motorized corn stover shredder to be collectively shared by groups of up to 30&#13;
farmers. Working capital would be provided to cover the operating costs of the first full&#13;
year. Farmers would be required to complete shed and silage pit construction before taking&#13;
delivery of their cattle. Loan repayments will be scheduled over six years.&#13;
3.5   Dairy Farming. About 6,440 farm households in six counties would receive 2-4&#13;
in-calf heifers on credit; the project would also provide for construction of a cow shed, feed&#13;
store and silage pit and provision of milk cans, a hand cart, and a corn stover shredder to be&#13;
shared by groups of up to 30 farmers. Larger associations of about 40 participating farmers&#13;
would receive a minitractor. Working capital covering up to 25 percent of the first full&#13;
year's operating costs would be provided. Farmers would be required to complete shed and&#13;
silage pit construction and establish a cooperative agreement for sharing a stover shredder&#13;
and a minitractor before taking delivery of their cattle. Loan repayments will be scheduled&#13;
over six years.&#13;
3.6   Pig Breeding and Fattening. The project would support the development of pig&#13;
breeding and fattening in 11 counties. About 340 households would establish breeding&#13;
units each with 19 female breeding stock and one boar. These specialized households&#13;
would produce a total of about 110,000 weaned piglets for sale each year. Breeding stock&#13;
would be from lean European or American breeds, which are readily available in the&#13;
province. Each sow would produce on average 17 weaned piglets per year. Sows and boars&#13;
would be replaced every three years.&#13;
3.7   Some 3,670 farm households would establish pig fattening farms, which would be&#13;
equally divided between 10- and 20-pig units. Weaned piglets would be purchased at 18-&#13;
20 kg and fattened to 100 kg. Each household would complete two cycles of pig fattening&#13;
annually, with losses estimated at 5 percent. Pigs would be fed a base mix of corn, soybean&#13;
cake and soybean meal supplemented with a vitamin/mineral mix, salt and bone meal with&#13;
all feed mixed on the farm. The project would provide breeding stock and piglets on credit&#13;
for the initial fattening cycle, pig sheds and feed stores, feed utensils, a hand cart, a&#13;
disinfectant sprayer and miscellaneous equipment. Working capital covering the operating&#13;
costs of the first breeding or fattening cycle would be provided. Farmers would be required&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
to complete pig shed construction before taking delivery of their pigs. Loan repayments&#13;
would be scheduled over six years.&#13;
3.8   Fox Breeding. The project would finance the expansion of a privately operated&#13;
nucleus fox breeding farm in Suihua County, which is already linked to a network of private&#13;
smallholder fox multiplication farms. Investment for the nucleus farm would include&#13;
rearing sheds, a feed processing workshop and cold store, a veterinary clinic, a power&#13;
substation, boiler house, offices, and a farmer training center. The project would also&#13;
provide on credit 800 imported stud silver foxes (160 breeding sets of four females and one&#13;
male) from a recognized breeder, feed processing, veterinary, laboratory and office&#13;
equipment and supplies, and incremental working capital to cover operating costs for the&#13;
first two years. On completion, the nucleus breeding farm would produce an additional&#13;
3,500 foxes annually, of which 1,800 would be selected as breeding stock for sale to&#13;
smallholders and the remainder would be processed.&#13;
3.9   Goose Breeding. The project would establish a goose breeding center at the&#13;
Provincial Animal Husbandry Breeding Center in Qiqihar. The center would raise&#13;
grandparent (GP) lines of imported Laine and domestic Fissured Eye geese, and would&#13;
breed and sell 240,000 goslings annually as parent stock of both lines to 970 specialized&#13;
households in nine participating counties. Each specialized household would receive on&#13;
credit 250 parent breeding stock for crossbreeding whose eggs would be sold to nine county&#13;
hatcheries to be established under the project. The nine county hatcheries would have a&#13;
total annual output of 5.2 million crossbred goslings. The project would finance the&#13;
construction of goose-breeding sheds, hatcheries, feed stores and offices and the initial&#13;
purchase of breeding stock. Equipment to be provided would include incubators, rearing&#13;
chambers, generators and transformers, and miscellaneous farm tools and equipment. The&#13;
project would also provide for vehicles, training and working capital.&#13;
3.10  Goose Fattening. About 33,300 households in nine counties would each raise&#13;
between 100 and 200 geese a year. Crossbred goslings would be purchased from the county&#13;
hatcheries in May/June and would be fattened, mostly on grass, supplemented with crop&#13;
residues and limited concentrate feed over 5-6 months. Geese would attain an average live&#13;
weight of 4 kg and be ready for slaughter in October/November. The project would include&#13;
the initial goslings, construction of night pens, concentrate feedstuff and veterinary services.&#13;
3.11  Feed Demand. The livestock feed demand under the project, with an annual&#13;
offtake of 108,000 pigs, 123,000 cattle, 110,000 tons of milk and 5 million geese, is not&#13;
expected to exceed available feed resources.  Incremental production represents an&#13;
approximate 3 percent rise in dairy cattle, 1.2 percent increase in swine, 10 percent increase&#13;
in beef, and a 15 percent increase in geese. Generally, pigs and dairy and beef cattle will be&#13;
stall-fed with grains and agricultural by-products supplemented with maize silage and grass&#13;
hay. Geese will be grazed extensively, however, they will be dispersed over a broad area&#13;
and their impact on range condition is expected to be minimal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
Aquaculture&#13;
3.12  The project would expand fish production in five counties and two cities. About&#13;
584 ha of new fish ponds would be constructed, and some 237 ha of existing low-yield&#13;
ponds would be rehabilitated.  The ponds would be contracted to 725 individual&#13;
households. A high-production carp model would be adopted., in which ponds would be&#13;
stocked with 80 percent common carp, 10 percent silver carp and 5 percent each of grass&#13;
carp and bighead carp. The ponds would have a water depth of 3 m to enable the fish to&#13;
survive over winter. The project would also finance the restocking of a 12,000 ha natural&#13;
lake with mixed carp species. The existing collective managing the lake fishery would be&#13;
increased from 75 to 150 members. Funds would be provided for pond excavation and&#13;
improvement and for construction of stores, pump houses and wells and electric power&#13;
supply lines, and supply of pumps, pipe and transformers. Vehicles, small boats, and&#13;
miscellaneous equipment would also be provided.&#13;
Agroprocessing&#13;
3.13  This component would include 19 livestock and crop processing enterprises,&#13;
involving both improvement and expansion of existing facilities and establishment of new&#13;
plants. The proposed development would ensure a close integration of raw material&#13;
supplies with processing, and enterprises would be encouraged to solicit share contributions&#13;
from farmers providing raw materials for processing. The crop processing enterprises&#13;
would utilize readily available cereals and oil seeds, which are produced in abundance in&#13;
the province. The livestock processing enterprises would provide the additional (and&#13;
upgraded) capacity to handle the incremental production under the project. A significant&#13;
feature of this component would be the reform measures to be carried out by the&#13;
participating processing enterprises-creation of autonomous corporate enterprises with&#13;
clear lines of governance, a fully transparent set of modem financial accounts, and clearly&#13;
defined management prerogatives and responsibilities. Participating subprojects have been&#13;
selected on the basis of the following eligibility criteria:  separate legal identity,&#13;
independent management structure and mandate, separate accounts and financial&#13;
statements, and satisfactory financial performance for at least the previous three years.&#13;
Should any of the selected enterprises drop out of the project, replacements would be&#13;
subject to the same eligibility criteria and subject to Bank approval. Once established, the&#13;
project enterprises would not undertake expansion until the project loans have been repaid.&#13;
Financing would cover expenditures for construction of buildings, machinery and&#13;
equipment, vehicles and training. Investments would also provide for comprehensive&#13;
wastewater treatment systems, and incremental working capital. The proposed processing&#13;
plants would utilize readily available raw material to generate added value and provide&#13;
increased employment in the project area. Subproject proposals were reviewed for market&#13;
strategy, appropriate technology, provision for adequate training and technical support, and&#13;
projected financial performance. Use of patented or otherwise legally protected technology&#13;
would be consistent with the enterprise's legal rights and obligations. Enterprises would be&#13;
required to make an equity contribution to proposed investment costs of not less than 30&#13;
percent. Subproject details are provided in Annex 2 and sunmarized below.&#13;

Institutional Development&#13;
3.16  Supporting Services for Livestock. The project would support the development of&#13;
a livestock management information system at the Heilongjiang Livestock Information and&#13;
Training Center through provision of computers, software and associated equipment. The&#13;
Information Center would be linked to key provincial livestock centers and to all project&#13;
counties through a wide area network. The Animal Breeding Center would be strengthened&#13;
through the upgrading of its semen processing facilities, procurement of new breeding&#13;
stock, and strengthening a small commercial embryo transfer program. An assurance was&#13;
obtained at negotiations that the price of semen produced at the Animal Breeding Center&#13;
would be increased by June 30, 2000 and adjusted periodically thereafter to achieve full&#13;
recovery of its cost of production. To this end Heilongfiang wouldfurnish the proposed&#13;
price to the Bank by January 1, 2000 for comment. Grassland research, focused on raising&#13;
pasture protein levels, primarily through legume introductions, would be supported under&#13;
the project. In addition, the project would finance a comparative goose breed performance&#13;
study at the Heilongjiang Provincial Animal Husbandry Breeding Institute. The study&#13;
would run for five years and would compare the performance and relative profitability of a&#13;
range of domestic goose lines against one or more imported breeds. The project would&#13;
strengthen livestock support services through the provision of transport and equipment.&#13;
Four-wheel-drive vehicles and small trucks would be provided for extension and disease&#13;
control, and specialized trucks for transporting liquid nitrogen for Al services.&#13;
3.17  Supporting Services for Crops. Both corn and soybean are important constituents&#13;
in livestock feed rations and are the raw materials for a number of proposed processing&#13;
enterprises. Ten seed facilities in the counties of Shuangcheng, Bayan, Hulan, Wangkui,&#13;
Suiling, Qiqihar, Zhaodong, Zhaoyang, Nehe and Dedu would be strengthened under the&#13;
project by upgrading the existing processing facilities. These units serve major corn- and&#13;
soybean-growing areas in the province. The project would finance construction of about&#13;
2&#13;
1,200 m of buildings for seed processing, and each unit would be equipped with a seed&#13;
processing line with a capacity to process at least 2,400 tons per year of corn and soybean&#13;
seed. The equipment would include dryers, cleaners, sorters, coating machines, weighing&#13;
and packing machines and seed testing and office equipment.&#13;
3.18  Project Management Support. The project would provide communication, data&#13;
processing and other office equipment for project offices at provincial, prefecture, county&#13;
and township levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Training and Technical Assistance&#13;
3.19 Livestock. Farmer training in livestock management and animal health for a total of&#13;
about 2,590 person-months would be provided. An assurance was obtained at negotiations&#13;
that at least 80 percent of the trainees in the farmer training program should be female.&#13;
Technical staff from the villages, townships and counties would receive a total of about 666&#13;
person-months of training. Higher-level training for provincial staff would total about&#13;
223.5 person-months. Topics to be covered would include animal breeding, nutrition and&#13;
management, and information systems and computer equipment management. Local and&#13;
overseas study tours covering beef and dairy production and management, and management&#13;
information systems would be conducted for a total of 23 and 21 person-months,&#13;
respectively. The training of provincial level trainers would be supported by domestic and&#13;
foreign technical assistance for a total of 65 and 15 person-months, respectively.&#13;
3.20 Aquaculture. Training under the aquaculture component includes 20 person-&#13;
months for technicians and 206 person-months for farmers, and domestic study tours for 46&#13;
persons. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that at least 30 percent of the trainees&#13;
in the aquaculture training program would be female.&#13;
3.21  Livestock and Crop Processing. The component would provide about 2,160&#13;
person-months of technical training in plant operations for staff and workers, 174 person-&#13;
months of training in business development for enterprise managerial and accounting staff,&#13;
12 months of overseas training, 29 person-months of domestic study tours, and 20 person-&#13;
months of overseas study tours. In addition, it would provide 28 person-months of&#13;
domestic technical assistance (TA) and 25 person-months of international TA, mainly for&#13;
training in the operation and maintenance of new slaughter lines and meat processing in&#13;
order to meet export quality standards. The project also includes TA (2 person months&#13;
each, of domestic and international) to undertake a study of the environmental and public&#13;
health problems in the livestock processing sector in Heilongjiang (para. 3.42). An&#13;
assurance was obtained at negotiations that Heilongiiang would employ consultants to&#13;
carry out this study and the goose breeding study (para. 3.16) not later than December 31,&#13;
1997.&#13;
3.22 Project Management and Crop Support. Project management staff at all levels&#13;
would receive training in accounting, monitoring, computer applications, and project&#13;
administration procedures totaling 152 person-months. In addition, the project would&#13;
provide 1,870 person-months of training to seed farmers and seed processing technicians.&#13;
An assurance was obtained at negotiations that Heilongfiang would furnish to the Bank by&#13;
November 30 of each year, a proposed program of training activities to be carried out in&#13;
the following calendar year and thereafter, implement such program as approved by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
D. STATUS OF PREPARATION&#13;
3.23  Preliminary designs have been prepared for all the components. Feasibility studies&#13;
have been carried out on all of the crop and livestock processing plants, and conceptual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
designs are generally at an advanced stage. Existing standard designs would be adopted for&#13;
farm buildings under the livestock production component. During preparation missions and&#13;
appraisal, the World Bank staff and consultants, working with the Provincial Project&#13;
Management Office (PMO), have reviewed about 50 agroprocessing proposals, of which 19&#13;
have been found generally suitable to participate in the project. In appraising subprojects,&#13;
three major factors were considered: the commitment of the enterprise to reform and to&#13;
environmentally-sustainable operations; the potential viability and profitability of the&#13;
proposed investment; and the capacity of the sponsors to repay the proposed loan (para.&#13;
3.13).&#13;
E. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.24  The project would be implemented over a period of five years. Project completion&#13;
is expected by June 30, 2002, and the loan closing by June 30, 2003. Aquaculture activities&#13;
would be phased over two years and livestock production over four years. Construction and&#13;
commissioning of crop and livestock processing plants would be completed over three years&#13;
and the plants would reach full production capacity in the fourth or fifth year. An&#13;
implementation schedule is shown in Chart 1.&#13;
F. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.25  The total project cost is estimated at $239.8 million, with a foreign exchange&#13;
component of $92.2 million or 38 percent of the total. Cost estimates are derived from&#13;
the preliminary designs (para. 3.23) and unit prices currently prevailing in the project area&#13;
or from price lists of local and overseas manufacturers of machinery and equipment.&#13;
Taxes and duties ($7.5 million) are included in the estimated costs.  Physical&#13;
contingencies of 10 percent have been included for civil works, materials, machinery and&#13;
equipment. Price contingencies for both foreign and local costs when expressed in US&#13;
dollars are based on annual international price escalation rates for all goods and services&#13;
of 1.7 percent for 1997, 2.2 percent for 1998, 2.6 percent for 1998, 2.8 percent for 2000,&#13;
2.6 percent for 2001 and 2.5 percent for 2002. When expressed in Yuan, they are based&#13;
on price escalation rates of 8 percent for 1997, 7 percent for 1998 and 6.5 percent for&#13;
1999-2002. Estimated costs are summarized in Table 3.2 and detailed in Annex 3.&#13;
3.26  The proposed IBRD loan of $120 million would finance 50 percent of total&#13;
project costs, equivalent to 100 percent of foreign exchange costs and 19 percent of local&#13;
costs. The balance of project costs would be financed by local sources as summarized in&#13;
Table 3.3.&#13;
3.27 The Government of China has selected LIBOR-based US dollar single currency&#13;
loan terms for the project in order to facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk&#13;
of its borrowing by more closely matching the currency of its liabilities with that of net&#13;
trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar denominated. Selection of the&#13;
LIBOR-based product would preserve the full maturity of the loan, compared to the fixed&#13;
rate option, which would have resulted in a 15-year loan. The Borrower judges that it can&#13;
manage the interest rate risk.&#13;

G. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.28   The Bank's Procurement Guidelines, January 1995 and revised January and August&#13;
1996, will be applied to all Bank-financed procurement. The Model Documents which&#13;
have been agreed between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Bank in July 1996,&#13;
would be adopted for all international competitive bidding (ICB) and national competitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
bidding (NCB) for civil works and goods, and the Standard Bid Evaluation Form would be&#13;
used. The procurement profile is shown in Table 3.4.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
Works&#13;
3.29  Civil works and buildings worth about $48.9 million would be required for the&#13;
project including agroprocessing and farm buildings and civil works for factory site&#13;
development, waste treatment facilities and aquaculture development. Works would be&#13;
spread over 33 counties and carried out over four years and would be too dispersed to be of&#13;
interest to foreign construction companies. About $16.6 million of buildings and civil&#13;
works for agroprocessing, aquaculture, and livestock breeding centers would be procured on&#13;
the basis of NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Farm buildings and minor works for&#13;
livestock raising, and some fishpond development ($32.3 million), would consist of many&#13;
small undertakings spread throughout the project area and would be built, with the Bank's&#13;
prior agreement, under force account by local labor forces mobilized by the counties,&#13;
townships and villages in cooperation with the beneficiaries.&#13;
Goods&#13;
3.30  Goods worth about $105.7 million would be required for the project. ICB&#13;
procedures would apply to most agroprocessing equipment ($39.2 million) and most&#13;
vehicles ($3.4 million). To the extent practicable, contracts for goods would be grouped&#13;
into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $250,000 or more for each. A&#13;
margin of preference equal to 15 percent of the CIF price of imported goods or the actual&#13;
customs duties and taxes, whichever is less, will be allowed to qualified domestic&#13;
manufacturers bidding under ICB procedures. Numerous other items of processing&#13;
equipment, and some equipment for the animal breeding center and county goose&#13;
hatcheries ($13.4 million) of many different types for installation at dispersed locations&#13;
over a period of three to four years, none of which could efficiently be grouped into&#13;
packages of more than $250,000, would be procured through NCB procedures. Most&#13;
livestock ($43.4 million) would be procured in small batches from local markets and&#13;
suppliers by direct contracting; cattle, geese and fox breeding stock and specialized&#13;
equipment for breeding centers ($1.0 million) would be procured through international&#13;
shopping. Some factory and farm vehicles ($0.5 million), and small quantities of&#13;
equipment, instruments and miscellaneous goods under contracts not exceeding $50,000&#13;
($5.3 million in aggregate) would be procured through national shopping.&#13;
Training and Technical Assistance&#13;
3.31  Training and technical assistance worth $3.9 million would be undertaken for the&#13;
project. Employment of all consultants would be in accordance with Bank Group&#13;
Guidelines for the use of consultants dated August 1981 and the Bank Group Standard&#13;
Form of Contract for consultants' services dated June 1995 would be used.&#13;
3.32  World Bank Review. All ICB contracts for goods, and works contracts of&#13;
$250,000 or more would be subject to prior review by the Bank. This would cover 69&#13;
percent and 27 percent of the total value of goods (excluding livestock inputs $44.4 million)&#13;
and works, respectively. The percentage of prior review of works is low because&#13;
investment is primarily in small farm buildings. Other contracts would be subject to ex-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
post review by supervision missions. During the first year of implementation, the target for&#13;
ex-post review would be 1 in 20 contracts and based on this experience, the ratio in&#13;
subsequent years would be adjusted accordingly. All contracts for consultant services in&#13;
excess of $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals would be subject to prior review&#13;
by the Bank. In addition, all terms of reference and sole-source selections of consultants are&#13;
subject to prior review. Heilongjiang Province has selected the China Machinery Import/&#13;
Export Corporation and the China Minerals and Metal Import/Export Corporation to assist&#13;
in procurement.&#13;
H. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.33  The proceeds of the IBRD loan would be disbursed as follows:&#13;

Total            120.0&#13;
3.34 To avoid delays in startup of the project, retroactive financing is recomnmended for&#13;
payments made between December 1, 1996 and the date of signing the Loan Agreement.&#13;
The following activities are likely to be covered: the goose grandparent breeding center&#13;
(purchase of breeding stock and site preparation); minor civil works and equipment for the&#13;
Provincial Livestock Information Center; initial site preparation for agroprocessing&#13;
enterprises and seed processing facilities; and training for enterprise management and&#13;
accounting staff and key project management office personnel. The total amount of&#13;
retroactive financing would be $4 million based on work programs reviewed by the Bank.&#13;
3.35  Statements of expenditure would be required for disbursements to be made against&#13;
(a) contracts for goods costing less than $250,000, (b) civil works costing less than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
$250,000, (c) study tours and training, and (d) consultants' services costing less than&#13;
$100,000 for firms, and less than $50,000 for individuals. Disbursements for all works&#13;
carried out under force account would be made against statements of physical progress&#13;
achieved at each site at unit prices agreed with the Bank at the start of the project and&#13;
subject to annual review.&#13;
3.36  To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account to be operated by the Provincial&#13;
Finance Bureau would be established in a bank acceptable to the World Bank, with an&#13;
initial deposit of $7 million, which is the four month estimated average disbursement&#13;
through the account. An estimated schedule of disbursements is provided in Annex 3.&#13;
I. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
3.37 Records of expenditures on civil works, equipment and materials would be&#13;
maintained individually by participating agroprocessing enterprises. These records would&#13;
be forwarded to the county PMOs, where similar records of expenditures on the livestock&#13;
and aquaculture components would be maintained. These complete records would be&#13;
forwarded regularly to the provincial PMO who would prepare consolidated project&#13;
accounts including their own records of expenditures. Consolidated project accounts would&#13;
be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and the audited reports would be&#13;
furnished by the auditors directly to the Bank. The Special Account would be audited&#13;
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Audited accounts for the entire&#13;
project together with the auditor's report would be submitted to the Bank within six months&#13;
of the close of each calendar year. The consolidated audit report would include details of&#13;
withdrawals from the Loan account made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure and the&#13;
auditor's opinion as to whether such withdrawals were against expenditures eligible for&#13;
reimbursement by IBRD. In addition, the agroprocessing enterprises would have their&#13;
financial statements audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and would&#13;
submit auditor's report to the Bank within six months of the close of each calendar year.&#13;
J. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
3.38  The project was assigned to Category B for the purposes of Operational Directive&#13;
4.01. The main potential environmental issues with the project are related to: (a) the&#13;
aquaculture component; and (b) the agroprocessing components.&#13;
3.39  Aquaculture.  The environmental issue potentially of substance with the&#13;
aquaculture component relates to the current land use in the aquaculture development areas.&#13;
The wetlands of Heilongjiang are important migratory bird habitats that have been&#13;
significantly reduced in area over the last few decades due to land reclamation activities.&#13;
All aquaculture development sites proposed for rehabilitation and new development under&#13;
the project were visited during project preparation. The rehabilitation sites (287 ha in total)&#13;
are already being used for aquaculture. Rehabilitation would mainly involve deepening of&#13;
the existing ponds and there would be no associated adverse environmental impact. One of&#13;
the proposed new development sites was rejected on the grounds that it was a functioning&#13;
wetland. All other new sites (584 hectares in total) were cleared for inclusion in the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30-&#13;
as they involved extension of existing aquaculture areas into what is at present wasteland&#13;
and, as such, would not result in adverse impacts.&#13;
3.40  Crop and Livestock Processing. The project will support investments in the&#13;
expansion or new development of 9 crop processing and 10 livestock processing facilities.&#13;
All 19 establishments were the subject of environmental impact assessments prepared in&#13;
accordance with relevant Government of China regulatory requirements. These were also&#13;
reviewed by relevant Bank staff. All processing factories are of small to medium size and&#13;
the main associated environmental issue is water pollution. Experience has shown that&#13;
control of air pollution-generally associated with boilers used for raising steam-is not&#13;
generally a problem with factories such as these since air pollution control equipment is&#13;
supplied as an integral part of boiler equipment currently being sold in China. An&#13;
additional issue identified as a result of site inspections during project preparation related to&#13;
the general lack of adequate public health standards in livestock processing factories, which&#13;
is indicative of shortcomings in province-wide regulatory arrangements in the livestock&#13;
processing sector (para. 3.42).&#13;
3.41  Preliminary designs for control of water pollution including both in-plant controls&#13;
(waste minimization) and end-of-pipe treatment plants have been reviewed by the Bank.&#13;
Water pollutants will mainly be organic material, color and turbidity and wastewater flows&#13;
will be low to medium. None of the proposed processing plants will produce toxic or&#13;
intractable water pollutants. The main pollution sources will be the corn, starch and oil&#13;
processing factories and the beef and pig abattoirs. However, due to the deficiencies&#13;
evident in the preliminary designs, an assurance was obtained at negotiations that&#13;
Heilongliang would engage the services of a team of independent pollution control experts&#13;
acceptable to the Bank to review final detailed designs.&#13;
3.42  Deficiencies identified in public health conditions in livestock processing factories,&#13;
indicated a need to improve the standards and effectiveness of public health supervision in&#13;
the livestock slaughtering and meat processing industries within the Province. These are&#13;
matters of concern to both the National and Provincial Governments and some effort has&#13;
been made recently to improve supervisory standards. Nevertheless, there remains a need&#13;
to identify a lead agency to be responsible for oversight of these industries. An initial step,&#13;
to be supported under the project, is for a study of the environmental and public health&#13;
problems in the livestock processing sector in Heilongjiang. Terms of Reference for the&#13;
study are contained in Annex 7. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that&#13;
Heilongiiang would engage consultants by December 31, 1997 to carry out the study and&#13;
provide the findings of the study and a plan for implementation of the recommendations for&#13;
Bank review by December 31, 1998.&#13;
3.43  Resettlement.  Resettlement necessitated by the project is limited to the&#13;
agroprocessing component where 4 ha of land would be acquired for three new enterprises.&#13;
The land is currently being farmed by six families and three single persons, in total 20&#13;
persons. No housing or other infrastructure is involved. These families would receive&#13;
compensation for crops in accordance with applicable Chinese law. Three families (eight&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
persons) would be allocated the same amount of new farm land of equal quality, and three&#13;
single farmers and one person from each of the remaining three families have signed&#13;
employment contracts with the new enterprises. The remaining six persons will be hired as&#13;
regular employees by the end of the year. An acceptable Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)&#13;
has been prepared in full consultation with the concerned households (Annex10). Under&#13;
the plan, which was scheduled to be completed by the end of 1996, all of the families would&#13;
have higher incomes following resettlement. Implementation of the plan would be&#13;
monitored by the local Land Administration Department. Guidelines for resettlement are&#13;
outlined in Annex 8. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that should any additional&#13;
resettlement be unavoidable under the Project, Heilongfiang would ensure that such&#13;
resettlement would be carried out in accordance with a RAP approved by the Bank and&#13;
developed on the basis of policies, planning principles, institutional arrangements and&#13;
design criteria acceptable to the Bank&#13;

4. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
4.1   The government of Heilongjiang would be responsible for overall project&#13;
implementation. The management structure would be similar to that used for other Bank&#13;
Group-financed provincial agricultural development projects in China, with Project Leading&#13;
Groups (PLGs) and Project Management Offices (PMOs) at the provincial, prefecture/&#13;
municipal and county levels.&#13;
4.2   Project Leading Groups (PLGs). Project Leading Groups are in place at all levels&#13;
and have played an active role in project preparation. The provincial PLG is headed by the&#13;
Vice-Governor responsible for agriculture, and includes representatives from the Planning&#13;
Commission, Finance, Livestock, Fisheries, Grain, TVE, State Asset Management and&#13;
Light Industry Bureaus, the Agriculture Commission, the Customs and Tax Departments,&#13;
the Reform Commission, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the All-China Women's&#13;
Federation. The main responsibilities of the provincial PLG are to formulate project plans&#13;
and policies, approve project feasibility studies, organize counterpart funds, and enlist&#13;
support of other relevant agencies. The provincial PLG would meet as needed to review&#13;
progress, coordinate the activities of other agencies, approve annual work programs and&#13;
budget, and provide guidance and supervision to the provincial PMO. It would also keep&#13;
the provincial government apprised of the overall progress of implementation. PLGs at&#13;
prefecture/municipal and county levels will have a similar structure and responsibilities.&#13;
4.3   Project Management Offices. A provincial PMO has been established at the&#13;
Provincial Planning Commission. The PMO would have overall responsibility for project&#13;
implementation under the guidance of the Provincial PLG. The PMO would (a) draw up&#13;
annual work programs and budgets; (b) review and approve lower level PMO work plans;&#13;
(c) undertake procurement for livestock and aquaculture and on behalf of the enterprises;&#13;
(d) prepare detailed project accounts; (e) organize training, technical assistance and project&#13;
supervision; (f) undertake project monitoring of physical and financial progress and&#13;
evaluations of project impact, and prepare progress reports; and (g) prepare withdrawal&#13;
applications and forward to the Bureau of Finance (BOF) for review and submission to the&#13;
Bank. At the prefecture/municipal and county levels, the PMOs established under the&#13;
Planning Commission would assist agencies and entities involved in implementing project&#13;
components and would liaise with the various technical and financial institutions that&#13;
support the project. Financial management of the project will be the responsibility of the&#13;
World Bank Division of the provincial BOF who will arrange for audits of the project&#13;
accounts.  Through its offices at lower levels, the BOF would authorize eligible&#13;
expenditures under the project and oversee and approve disbursement and recovery of&#13;
subloans. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that the PMOs would be maintained&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and staffed by competent staff in adequate&#13;
numbers. Assurances were also obtained that Heilongliang would send the Bank by&#13;
November 30 of each year annual work programs for the following year 's activities to be&#13;
carried out under the Project, including consolidated work programs for each of the&#13;
agroprocessing enterprises and thereafter implement such work programs as shall have&#13;
been approved by the Bank.&#13;
4.4   Technical Panel. A provincial technical panel has been established to make&#13;
recommendations on technical aspects to LGs and PMOs. The panel is composed of&#13;
scientists, technical specialists and engineers from cooperating research institutes and&#13;
technical bureaus including the Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Bureaus, Northeast&#13;
Agricultural University, Heilongjiang International Engineering Consultants Company,&#13;
Harbin Institute of Light Industry and the Heilongjiang Commercial Institute. Their main&#13;
functions would be to review and advise on technical standards for engineering, livestock&#13;
breeding and forage production, training and technical assistance.&#13;
B. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.5   The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will make available the proceeds of the LIBOR-&#13;
based US dollar single currency IBRD loan to Heilongjiang Province on the same terms&#13;
(variable LIBOR-based interest, applicable commitment charges and 20-year maturity,&#13;
including a 5-year grace period). The provincial BOF would onlend through prefecture,&#13;
municipal and country finance bureaus to end-users on terms whereby the maturities would&#13;
be up to six years (including two years' grace) for livestock and aquaculture production&#13;
activities and up to nine years (including three years' grace) in the case of agroprocessing&#13;
subloans, with the BOF bearing the foreign exchange risk, except for dollar-denominated&#13;
subloans to agroprocessing enterprises, where the foreign exchange risk would be passed on&#13;
to the enterprise. The interest rate for Renminbi-denominated loans would be equal to the&#13;
Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) rate prevailing from time to time for loans of the same&#13;
maturity for similar investments. The interest rate of dollar-denominated loans would be&#13;
the standard variable rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans, plus a spread&#13;
of 1.2 percent per year (to cover administrative and other costs) and applicable commitment&#13;
charges. Onlending to farmers and enterprises would be only for activities that have been&#13;
appraised and approved by the PMOs. At negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom the&#13;
Borrower that the Loan would be made available to Heilongliang on the terms outlined&#13;
above and from the Heilongjiang Provincial Government that (a) loan proceeds used to&#13;
finance items for livestock and aquaculture would be repaid as described above, and&#13;
(b) agroprocessing subloans would be made on the terms described above in accordance&#13;
with procedures and on conditions acceptable to the Bank&#13;
4.6   Eligibility Criteria. The following criteria (summarized below and detailed in&#13;
were used, and would be used, in selecting enterprises for inclusion in the project:&#13;
(a)   Demonstrated commitment to the enterprise reform process by undertaking&#13;
a restructuring program in line with the objective of the reformn;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
(b)   Separate legal identity, permission to borrow in its own name, and conduct&#13;
the activities proposed under the project;&#13;
(c)   Sound management structure and mandate;&#13;
(d)   Separate accounts and financial statements in the new form;&#13;
(e)   Satisfactory financial performance for at least the previous three years;&#13;
(f)    Been in existence and engaged in similar operations for not less than three&#13;
years.&#13;
4.7   The proposed investments were evaluated using the following criteria:&#13;
(a)   The proposal is an integral part of a practical business plan for the&#13;
enterprise, predicated on realistic market analysis and strategy;&#13;
(b)   The proposed technology, including product specifications and scale of&#13;
operations is consistent with current industry and market norms;&#13;
(c)   The proposed  investment is in  compliance  with  the Borrower's&#13;
environmental laws and regulations and has been developed in accordance&#13;
with an environmental impact assessment approved by the local&#13;
environmental protection bureau (EPB);&#13;
(d)   Adequate provision has been made for training and technical support at the&#13;
production and managerial levels;&#13;
(e)   Equity contribution to proposed investment costs of not less than 30 percent,&#13;
up to one half of which may be in the form of existing assets that are&#13;
essential to the investment; and&#13;
(f)    The proposal is financially viable.&#13;
4.8   Recovery of Project Investments. Heilongjiang Province will recover all funds&#13;
disbursed from the proceeds of the Loan, amounting to 50 percent of the project cost. The&#13;
participating county BOFs would be responsible for full recovery of the IBRD portion of&#13;
total project funding. Counties would repay municipalities/prefectures, which would repay&#13;
the province, which would in turn repay MOF for the use of the IBRD loan. Domestic&#13;
funds would be returned to the respective county BOFs. All investment costs would be&#13;
repaid by project participants. Heilongjiang will repay the cost of training, study tours, and&#13;
technical assistance extended to government implementing agencies (the studies on goose&#13;
breeding and meat processing, the grassland improvement research), the investment costs of&#13;
the provincial breeding center and seed processing units, and equipment for the PMOs.&#13;
Farmers will contribute 20 percent of the total cost of their investments and the remainder&#13;
will be recovered over six years, with two years of grace; enterprises will contribute 30&#13;
percent of the total cost of their investment, and the remainder will be recovered over nine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35 -&#13;
years with three years of grace.  Cost recovery would begin in the third year of&#13;
implementation (starting in the second semester of 1999) and be completed in the eleventh&#13;
year (second semester of 2007).&#13;
C. MANAGEMENT OF PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES&#13;
4.9   Livestock Production and Aquaculture. The production of livestock and fish will&#13;
be undertaken by individual farm households except for fish-raising in Longhupao Lake,&#13;
which is managed as a collective. Planning, implementation and supervision of livestock&#13;
and aquaculture development would be the responsibility of the municipal, county and&#13;
township PMOs. The Animal Husbandry Bureau (AHB) and the Bureau of Aquatic&#13;
Products (BAP) would provide technical support. AHB would provide livestock extension,&#13;
veterinary and Al services and undertake training of project staff and farmers. An&#13;
assurance was obtained at negotiations that Heilongliang would ensure that livestock&#13;
activities in the project are designed and implemented in accordance with farm models&#13;
acceptable to the Bank BAP would supervise the construction of fish ponds and arrange&#13;
the leasing of production ponds to individual households on the basis of a three-year&#13;
renewable contract. BAP would supply inputs and provide technical assistance and&#13;
training.&#13;
4.10  Agroprocessing. Each of the agroprocessing enterprises would be a commercial&#13;
entity under independent management. The enterprises would have a large measure of&#13;
managerial autonomy with professional management teams responsible for all aspects of&#13;
company operations.&#13;
D. PROJECT LAUNCH WORKSHOP&#13;
4.11  To initiate project implementation, Bank staff and local experts would conduct a&#13;
project launch workshop in Harbin at a date to be determined after project approval, for&#13;
staff of the PMOs at all levels. The purpose of the workshop would be to review the&#13;
program for implementation and to clarify tasks and responsibilities at each level. Topics&#13;
would include procurement and disbursement guidelines and procedures, financial&#13;
management, supervision, monitoring, evaluation and reporting, and other relevant subjects.&#13;
E. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING&#13;
4.12  The provincial, prefectural, municipal and county PMOs would monitor the&#13;
project's overall progress and impacts and evaluate the economic and financial benefits&#13;
from each component. The county PMOs would keep a current account of physical and&#13;
financial progress for each component. For the livestock and aquaculture components, the&#13;
PMOs would monitor input use and production costs, outputs, farm incomes and&#13;
employment generation. Each participating enterprise in the agroprocessing component has&#13;
its own implementation plan against which progress would be measured. Each enterprise&#13;
would submit a semiannual progress report to the county or municipal PMO. The report&#13;
would cover (a) enterprise reform including asset evaluation, drawing up of a new charter,&#13;
registration as a limited liability company, and appointment of boards of directors and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
supervisors; (b) expenditures on civil works, plant and equipment, and staff training and&#13;
numbers trained; and (c) operations including employment generation, production and sales,&#13;
net profit, profit in relation to assets, and debt/equity ratio. An assurance was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that Heilongliang would prepare andfurnish to the Bank semiannual progress&#13;
reports by January 31 and July 31 of each year&#13;
4.13 Environmental Management and Monitoring. All agroprocessing plants will be&#13;
required to satisfy the environmental management and monitoring requirements of the&#13;
relevant environmental protection bureau. All treatment facilities would meet Chinese&#13;
National Standards and be fully operational prior to each facility commencing trial&#13;
production. Individual enterprises would monitor and record air and waste water emissions&#13;
in accordance with the requirements of the relevant EPB. Routine checks and independent&#13;
monitoring of pollution control will be carried out by the local environmental monitoring&#13;
stations. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that each enterprise would do routine&#13;
monitoring of its air and wastewater emissions and include the results of this monitoring in&#13;
its periodic reporting to Heilongliang and the Bank.&#13;
4.14 Supervision and Mid-Term Review. A plan for Bank supervision is given in&#13;
Annex 9. The provincial PMO would undertake a mid-term review to assess progress and&#13;
chart remaining implementation and would also prepare an implementation completion&#13;
report for submission to the Bank no later than six months following the closing date. An&#13;
assurance was obtained at negotiations that Heilongliang wouldfurnish the Bank with a&#13;
mid-term report by December 31, 1999.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
5. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   The major benefit of the project would be incremental livestock, fishery and&#13;
agroprocessing production, which would generate a net present value of incremental net&#13;
benefits of Y 1,236.8 million over the 15-year life of the project (at a 12 percent discount&#13;
rate). At full development, the annual incremental net value of production would be&#13;
Y 526.4 million, accruing from livestock production (45 percent), fisheries (4 percent) and&#13;
agroprocessing (51 percent). About 53,000 rural families would increase their farm&#13;
incomes with the addition of livestock activities, supported by introduction of the provincial&#13;
livestock management information system and the livestock and goose breed improvement&#13;
programs. About 19 small- to medium-size enterprises would provide additional processing&#13;
capacity for local crops and livestock, furthering the integration of producers and&#13;
processors. The project would allow existing enterprises to overcome the constraints of&#13;
outdated technology, poor management and outmoded operational mechanisms and would&#13;
ensure that new enterprises are established with corporate structures and operating&#13;
procedures consistent with the enterprise reform process now under way. In addition, the&#13;
project would create environmental benefits in agro-industries through the introduction of&#13;
improved waste minimization and waste treatment technology.&#13;
5.2   Production. Annual incremental production from the livestock activities at full&#13;
development would be 123,000 beef cattle, 108,000 fattened pigs, 5 million geese, and&#13;
99,000 tons of fresh milk. Additional production includes 8,800 tons of fish and 900 pairs&#13;
of breeding foxes. With the increased availability of animal manure, annual crop&#13;
production in participating households is estimated to increase by up to 5 percent,&#13;
amounting to total incremental production of 6,800 tons of corn, 800 tons of soybeans, and&#13;
500 tons of wheat.&#13;
5.3   The project would provide for establishment or improvement/expansion of 19&#13;
agroprocessing plants (9 for crops and 10 for livestock) to integrate production, processing&#13;
and marketing. Annual incremental production of main products would be 33,900 tons of&#13;
milk and meat products, 2,090 tons of fruit and bean products, 29,000 tons of seeds, 6,180&#13;
tons of vegetable oil, 76,900 tons of wheat flour and milled rice, and 42,000 tons of corn&#13;
starch products.&#13;
5.4   Employment and Incomes. Employment opportunities generated by the project&#13;
would help reduce seasonal unemployment and underemployment in and around the project&#13;
areas. The farmers' cropping cycle is short due to the severe and long winters in the project&#13;
area, leading to serious underemployment during the winter months when farming activities&#13;
are at a standstill. The expansion of livestock production would absorb surplus labor on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
beneficiaries' farms providing gainful employment virtually year-round for the beef, dairy&#13;
and pig-raising families. At full development, livestock activities would create an annual&#13;
incremental demand for 8.0 million days of farm family labor and 600,000 days of hired&#13;
labor. The resulting income generation has the added benefit of providing the incentive for&#13;
presently underemployed fann labor to remain in the countryside, rather than migrating to&#13;
urban areas where they would be exacerbating problems of inadequate infrastructure and&#13;
already overburdened social services. Average incomes of participants in the livestock&#13;
component would increase from about Y 1,465 per capita to about Y 2,680 per capita as a&#13;
result of the project. The agroprocessing component would generate additional demand for&#13;
skilled and semiskilled labor equivalent to about 2,860 permanent full-time jobs and 1,120&#13;
part-time jobs.&#13;
B. MARKETING&#13;
5.5   The market prospects for project production are favorable because domestic demand&#13;
for meat, poultry and aquatic products is increasing as a result of increasing per capita&#13;
incomes and increasing population. Moreover, the incremental amounts of project livestock&#13;
and livestock products are small, ranging from 1 to 10 percent of present provincial&#13;
production levels. Marketing studies were carried out by the Heilongjiang Commercial&#13;
College of the Ministry of Domestic Trade and the Harbin Institute of Technology School&#13;
of Management (Annex 9). The findings of the studies have identified and evaluated&#13;
existing and potential markets and competitors, assessed market demand, and determined&#13;
distribution channels and packaging requirements. Information gained from these studies&#13;
has contributed significantly in finalizing preparation of the agroprocessing proposals and&#13;
will be used by enterprise managers to develop their marketing strategies.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
5.6   Pigs. China is the largest pig producing country in the world, with 415 million pigs&#13;
or 42 percent of the world stock (1994). Heilongjiang's contribution is small, with only&#13;
about 7.9 million pigs slaughtered annually, and the project's production would add only&#13;
about 108,000 pigs per year to this total. Farmers will sell at the local markets to traders for&#13;
slaughter and local use, to processors, or to other traders for resale outside the local area.&#13;
5.7   Most of China's pig production is consumed domestically, with current per capita&#13;
consumption at about 20 kg. Live pigs are exported, mostly to Hong Kong, under an export&#13;
quota allocated to the provinces-Heilongjiang seldom exports live pigs. In 1994, chilled&#13;
and frozen pork exports had risen to 101,000 tons, with Heilongjiang providing about 16&#13;
percent of this amount, mostly to Russia.&#13;
5.8   Beef Cattle. Government's policy is to encourage the development and expansion&#13;
of pasture-based beef production by providing access to grasslands (1 mu per animal),&#13;
subsidized breeding fees, and exemption from the local slaughter tax of Y 13 per head.&#13;
Because brewers' and distillers' taxes are reduced if their waste by-products are used for&#13;
cattle feed, farmers make extensive use of these materials as low-cost inputs, which give an&#13;
equivalent metabolic energy at about half the cost of corn. The project's incremental&#13;
production of about 123,000 head annually is equivalent to about 10 percent of the&#13;
provincial offtake in 1994, and existing market channels have the capacity to handle the&#13;
incremental production. Producers would sell to local traders for slaughter and local use,&#13;
directly to processors, or to other traders for resale outside the province.&#13;
5.9   Dairy cattle. Milk producers would supply milk in cans to village collection&#13;
centers for collection by the dairy processors who service allocated geographic regions.&#13;
While this practice could be construed as a geographic monopoly for processors and&#13;
limiting market choices for producers, it does allow farmers with small herds to participate&#13;
in a commercial distribution network and provides a reliable market for producers and a&#13;
reliable source of supply for processors. In 1993, the combination of higher input prices&#13;
and unchanged milk procurement prices led to a slight stagnation of production as farmers&#13;
reduced herd size and milk output. Producer milk prices increased in 1994 and now&#13;
production continues to rise. The introduction of pricing differentials provides an effective&#13;
incentive structure for improving milk quality at the producer level. Most farmers receive&#13;
an unregulated price of Y 1.5-1.8/kg for 3.4 and 3.5 percent butterfat, respectively.&#13;
5.10  The processing plants sell through their marketing representatives, who operate in&#13;
target markets, or ex-factory to traders and buyers. In the province, there are more than 170&#13;
factories, which in aggregate have adequate capacity for the project's incremental&#13;
production. The combination of increasing demand for milk-based products, particularly&#13;
ice cream and yogurt, and the relatively low profit from selling fresh milk provides an&#13;
incentive for dairies to focus on further processing to dry milk powder and most recently,&#13;
introducing UHT milk. The project will provide support to one processing activity for&#13;
restructuring production to include UHT milk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
5.11  Per capita milk consumption in China is relatively low at 4.8 kg per year (of this,&#13;
4.2 kg is cow milk), far below the world average of 48 kg. Urban consumption figures&#13;
for fresh dairy products are slightly higher at 5.3 kg (1994), reflecting increasing&#13;
consumption of ice cream and yogurt. The Government expects consumption to increase&#13;
to 7.3 kg per capita in 2000 and 9.30 kg in 2010, particularly in the nutrition-oriented&#13;
consumption of fresh and reconstituted milk for children; the urban market for milk-based&#13;
drinks, ice creams, and yogurt; and the baking and confectionery demand for butter and&#13;
cheese. Recent trade statistics show increasing imports of both dry-milk products and&#13;
UHT milk and decreases of exported fluid milk; these trends are expected to continue as&#13;
domestic demand rises.&#13;
5.12  Geese. Producers would operate as grow-out contractors to processing enterprises,&#13;
thus ensuring a reliable market for their production. Processing in the province has been a&#13;
constraint in the past, and the project would provide expansion and/or rehabilitation of&#13;
seven processing operations. The plants would slaughter and process the geese and treat the&#13;
feathers to varying degrees. Output would be in the form of whole geese, cut parts and&#13;
deboned meat, all of which would be vacuum packed in plastic and frozen. From the&#13;
factory, the geese are sold through several channels, including to traders ex-factory, under&#13;
contract to large-scale distributors or institutional consumers, or through marketing agents&#13;
operating in target markets. To encourage production, the province has waived a trading/&#13;
sales tax of Y 1 per head.&#13;
5.13  China's goose production has grown by about 10 percent annually since 1990, in&#13;
response to increased demand for meat and down feathers. Consumption of the meat is&#13;
increasing with rising urban incomes and increasing demand for a wider range of meats and&#13;
poultry. Goose is particularly popular in some of the large coastal cities, such as Shanghai,&#13;
and in the southern provinces, generally through the restaurant trade. There are eight goose&#13;
feather processing facilities in the project area and a number of factories produce finished&#13;
product. In addition to the domestic market, the province also exports finished products,&#13;
principally to the United States, Russia and Hong Kong.&#13;
C. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES&#13;
5.14  Financial Analysis. Financial analysis has been carried out separately for the&#13;
livestock, aquaculture and agroprocessing components of the project. Since the livestock&#13;
production is intended to supplement earnings from crop production and to take advantage&#13;
of farm production of crops and by-products, a base case farm model was developed for an&#13;
average 1.6 ha of cropped area (1.0 ha of maize, 0.4 ha of soybean, and 0.2 ha of wheat).&#13;
Farm labor availability is estimated at 500 person-days per family, of which about 200 are&#13;
used for crop production. The addition of a livestock activity to the farm raises crop yields&#13;
by up to 5 percent through the introduction of additional manure to the farming system,&#13;
reduces the requirement for chemical fertilizers and requires an additional 5 days of labor/ha&#13;
for spreading manure. Separate models have been developed for pig breeding operations,&#13;
10- and 20-head pig production units, 10- and 20-head cattle fattening units, 2- and 4-cow&#13;
dairy farms, goose crossbreeders, 100- and 200-head goose production units, and a nucleus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
fox breeding farm. Livestock models used for financial analysis show positive cash flows&#13;
and acceptable financial rates of return (FRRs) for all types of livestock, ranging from 27 to&#13;
43 percent, except for geese; goose fattening, with an FRR of 65 percent, is a low-input&#13;
activity, based on grazing of summer pasture, minimal purchased feed, and farm labor (not&#13;
costed), and yields full benefits during the first year. Aquaculture gives an FRR of 33&#13;
percent. In the analysis of the agroprocessing plants, value added tax and incomes taxes at a&#13;
rate of 33 percent of net profits have been included, and individual FRRs range from 17 to&#13;
38 percent. Sensitivity analyses have been carried out for all components to evaluate the&#13;
effect on the project of changes in major variables such as price, investment and operating&#13;
costs. They indicate the FRRs of the livestock and aquaculture components are relatively&#13;
robust to changes in revenues and operating costs. Among the agroprocessing subprojects,&#13;
the FRRs for wheat processing and the pig and beef abattoirs show some sensitivity to&#13;
changes in revenues; this sensitivity is a normal phenomenon in the meat industry.&#13;
5.15  Economic Analysis. Economic analyses have been carried out for the individual&#13;
components and for the project as a whole, using constant 1996 border prices. World Bank&#13;
price projections or average export and import prices actually realized by China were used&#13;
to estimate farm-gate economic prices in 1996 constant terms for traded inputs and outputs.&#13;
All investment costs, including physical contingencies, have been taken into account in&#13;
estimating the economic cost of the project. For nontraded goods, the local market price&#13;
was used as the economic price. While most project analysis in China values rural&#13;
unskilled labor at the prevailing market wage, this analysis uses the nominal wage in project&#13;
areas adjusted by a conversion factor of 0.90. This shadow wage reflects the fact that&#13;
Heilongjiang continues to face significant distortions in its internal labor market, as it has&#13;
not benefited from the loosening of rural-urban migration, the rapid growth of rural nonstate&#13;
enterprises, and the consequent greater labor mobility found in the more developed labor&#13;
markets of southern and eastern China. As a result, except for the peak seasons of planting&#13;
and harvesting, there is a surplus of agricultural workers with little alternative employment&#13;
opportunities, leading to a marginal value product of labor below market wages during the&#13;
off-season when many project activities are implemented. All economic values were&#13;
converted to local currency at the prevailing official exchange rate of Y 8.3/$1.0. Based on&#13;
the above assumptions, the economic rates of return (ERRs) are 30 percent for livestock, 44&#13;
percent for aquaculture, 36 percent for agroprocessing, and 33 percent for the total project.&#13;
Sensitivity analyses have been carried out for all components to evaluate the effect of&#13;
changes in the economic variables such as price, investment and operating cost. This&#13;
indicates that the ERRs of all components are relatively robust to changes in revenues and&#13;
operating costs.&#13;
D. RISKS&#13;
5.16  Projects risks have been identified and measures incorporated in the project to&#13;
minimize their effect. The risk that enterprise reform will not be carried out has been&#13;
reduced by selection of enterprises that already have begun corporate restructuring. The&#13;
risk that counterpart funds will not be provided in a timely manner has been addressed by&#13;
discussion and confirmation of the financing plans of individual enterprises and livestock&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
production units. Experience shows, however, that this risk remains, for any given project&#13;
in China. The potential marketing risk for agroprocessing and livestock products would be&#13;
minimized by provision of improved processing technology and packaging, and the&#13;
development of market strategies for each product during project preparation, as well as&#13;
provision for training enterprise marketing and sales staff during implementation. There is&#13;
minimal technical risk in the livestock production activities, as both the animal husbandry&#13;
agencies and numerous farmers in the province have wide experience and knowledge in&#13;
livestock raising, which will be reinforced by provision of training during implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Zhaozhou Corn Processing&#13;
5.    The original starch factory, a collective owned by the county, was built in 1968&#13;
and has been modernized and expanded several times. The plant processes about 19,000&#13;
tons of corn per year into 12,000 tons of corn starch and also produces about 1,000 tons&#13;
of sodium glutamate. It will produce raw material for a new enterprise which would be&#13;
established as a limited liability company with ownership shared by the Zhaozhou Starch&#13;
Factory (35 percent), the Zhaozhou Fireworks Factory (30 percent), the Zhaozhou&#13;
Alcohol Factory (17 percent) and other shareholders (18 percent). Other shareholders&#13;
comprise staff and surrounding villages, e.g., Feng Yun village has designated Y 5&#13;
million for shares from its Y 20 million of land use fees from the Daqing Oil Field.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                    ANNEX2&#13;
6.    Under the project, the new enterprise would be provided with three new&#13;
processing lines to further process 19,000 tons of corn starch per year into 10,000 tons of&#13;
crystalline glucose, 6,000 tons of biodegradable polymers, 2,800 tons of whole-sugar&#13;
powder, and 500 tons of acetyl propionic acid. Production of crystalline glucose was&#13;
expanded from an earlier proposal on the basis of the market studies which indicated a&#13;
good market for this product. Crystalline glucose would be manufactured to WHO&#13;
standards and would be sold on the domestic market for use in the pharmaceutical&#13;
industry. Biodegradable polymers would be used for fast food packaging and for plastic&#13;
film in agriculture. Acetyl propionic acid will be used as a solvent and antioxidant in the&#13;
pharmaceutical, agrochemical and paint industries.&#13;
7.    The project will finance construction of about 10,900 m2 of buildings for&#13;
workshops, stores and utilities, a waste water treatment system, processing equipment&#13;
and vehicles. The estimated investment cost is Y 120.6 million (excluding incremental&#13;
working capital).&#13;
Tailai Mung Bean Processing&#13;
8.    This new factory will be established in Daqing town to produce 1,000 tons/year of&#13;
soluble mung bean powder as an instant beverage. A Limited Liability Company will be&#13;
established with ownership shared by Xinde Construction Company (39 percent), six&#13;
townships (52 percent), and individual shareholders (9 percent). The process, which will&#13;
utilize about 600 tons of dried mung beans/year, involves grinding the beans to which&#13;
sugar is added, and homogenized and spray-dried using a technology developed at Jilin&#13;
University. Market surveys indicate a strong demand for the product that would be&#13;
mainly sold in large cities in southern China. The project will finance about 2,000 m of&#13;
factory buildings, processing equipment, electrical, water and steam supply and&#13;
distribution systems, air conditioning and laboratory equipment, vehicles and market&#13;
development. The estimated investment cost is estimated to be Y 12.8 million (excluding&#13;
initial working capital).&#13;
Nehe Songnen Wheat Flour Processing Company&#13;
9.    The existing wheat mill (Nehe No. 3 Grain Store) is an SOE under the Nehe City&#13;
Grain Bureau and was set up in 1971. Profitability has declined in recent years due to old&#13;
equipment and outdated technology. The existing machinery and equipment will be&#13;
replaced and an additional 8,700 m of workshops and warehousing will be built. Under&#13;
the project, a limited liability company would be established with ownership divided&#13;
between the existing No. 3 Grain Store (19 percent), the Nehe Feed Mill (24 percent), the&#13;
Nehe Oil Plant (26 percent), and staff (7 percent).&#13;
10.   The mill will process 50,000 tons of wheat per year (200 tons/day in 3 shifts) and&#13;
produce 36,000 tons of flour. The mill will be equipped with a gluten separation line to&#13;
produce high and low gluten flour (17,500 tons) in addition to standard and special&#13;
grades. There is an increasing demand in China for specialized wheat flour for bread&#13;
making (high gluten), and for cakes and biscuits (low gluten). China currently imports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
20,000 tons/year of high gluten flour. A market survey conducted in Heilongjiang&#13;
indicates the demand for high and low gluten flour in the province is about 30,000 tons&#13;
per year, all of which is brought in from other provinces. The total investment cost is&#13;
estimated at Y 121.0 million (excluding incremental working capital).&#13;
Bayan Corn Product Company&#13;
11.   This is a new enterprise, established as a limited liability company, owned by the&#13;
Bayan Granulated Feedstuff Company (36 percent), the Xingjiang Oil Company&#13;
(32 percent), and the Bingguo Beer Company (32 percent). Xingjiang Oil Company is&#13;
one of the 500 largest enterprises in the country, and the other two are considered&#13;
advanced enterprises of Xiji township, where the new enterprise will be located. Bayan&#13;
county is one of the main corn producing areas in Heilongjiang, averaging 650,000 tons&#13;
per year, of which some 300,000 tons are marketed.&#13;
12.   The project would finance construction of about 6,000 m of workshops, offices&#13;
and stores, processing equipment, waste water treatment facilities, miscellaneous&#13;
equipment and vehicles, and technical advisory services. The feasibility study was&#13;
prepared by the Heilongjiang Chemical Engineering Design Institute.&#13;
13.   The plant will process 18,000 tons of starch slurry per year and produce 6,000&#13;
tons of modified starch products. All products would be sold in the domestic market&#13;
where the main consumers would be the food, textile and pharmaceutical industries. The&#13;
total investment cost is estimated at Y 41.8 million (excluding initial working capital).&#13;
Lanxi County Oil Limited Corporation&#13;
14.   Under the project an existing linseed and soybean processing enterprise in Lanxi&#13;
would be expanded. Established as a state run enterprise in 1956, the plant was&#13;
modernized in 1993 and has now converted to a limited liability company with&#13;
participation of private investors. At present the plant processes about 6,000 tons/year of&#13;
linseed and 25,000 tons/year of soybean to produce semicrude vegetable oils.&#13;
15.   A new processing line will be added to refine the semicrude soybean and further&#13;
process this into epoxy oil. The new line will have an annual output of 3,200 tons of&#13;
refined soybean oil and 2,000 tons of soybean epoxy oil. There is a strong domestic&#13;
demand for epoxy oil which is used mainly in the manufacture of polyvinylchloride&#13;
plastic (PVC), and also in the production of copper foil laminates used in the electronics&#13;
industry as a cheaper alternative to tung oil.&#13;
16.   The project will finance some 4,100 m2 of additional factory buildings, processing&#13;
equipment and vehicles. The existing waste water treatment system will be expanded and&#13;
improved. The total estimated investment cost is Y 22.8 million (excluding incremental&#13;
working capital).&#13;

Lanxi Linseed Limited Liability Company&#13;
17.   Lanxi County is one of the main flax producing areas in China, with a cropped&#13;
area of 16,600 ha (18 percent of all China) and has one of the largest flax fiber processing&#13;
and spinning plants in the country. The Lanxi County Flax Seed Company, which has&#13;
operated for more than 20 years as a county SOE, processes about 2,000 tons of seed per&#13;
year. About 5,000 small farmers who are contract seed growers supply this plant. The&#13;
present plant is completely run down, unable to meet the standard needed to produce high&#13;
quality seed, and will be shut down. In preparation for the project, a new enterprise has&#13;
been set up as a limited liability company with the participation of the original company&#13;
(35 percent), the Lanxi Raw Material Company (15 percent), Lanxi Research Institute&#13;
(20 percent), Lanxi Flax Development Company (10 percent) and staff (20 percent).&#13;
Additional shares will be offered to flax farmers and staff of the owner enterprises.&#13;
18.   The project would finance construction of 2,700 m2 of new processing plant&#13;
including a seed processing workshops, storage buildings for raw material and processed&#13;
seeds, and a sun drying floor. Seed processing equipment would be provided with a&#13;
capacity of 2.5 ton/hour including seed cleaners, graders, sorters, and weighing and&#13;
packing machines, which would be supplied as an integrated processing line. Seed&#13;
laboratory and office equipment and vehicles would also be provided. The investment&#13;
would also include 6 tractors with cultivation and seeding implements that the enterprise&#13;
would operate to provide mechanized land preparation and seed sowing to contract seed&#13;
growers. The seed production base will be expanded to produce 5,000 tons/year of a high&#13;
yielding flax variety developed by the Heilongjiang Flax Research Institute, which was&#13;
released 3 years ago. The new variety is resistant to lodging and disease with 5 percent&#13;
higher fiber content and 20 percent higher seed yield. The bulk of the seed will be&#13;
marketed in the province, which accounts for 90 percent of the flax cropped area in&#13;
China. The total investment cost is estimated to be Y 9.4 million (excluding initial&#13;
working capital).&#13;
Qiqihar Seabuckthorn Processing&#13;
19.   This will be a new enterprise to be established as a limited liability company with&#13;
shareholders being the Qiqihar Fulong Chemical Industry Company, the Qiqihar&#13;
Horticultural Research Institute and local farmers. At the time of appraisal, the two main&#13;
partners had completed land acquisition for the new project, prepared draft Articles and&#13;
selected a board of directors. The new company would be registered in parallel with&#13;
initiation of the project. The factory will process the fruit of seabuckthorn (Hippophae&#13;
rhamnoides) a native shrub of northern China grown mostly for protection of degraded&#13;
lands. The fruit is rich in vitamins, and both juice and oil extract are valued for their&#13;
health and medicinal properties. There is a strong demand for these products in China&#13;
and a large potential export market in Japan and the CIS.  About 1,000 ha of&#13;
seabuckthorn are grown in the area at present but with the project the company will invest&#13;
in a seedling nursery that will provide planting material of recently introduced high-&#13;
yielding varieties and allow expansion of the planted area by 3,000 to 4,000 ha over a 3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51-                      ANNEX2&#13;
year period. At full development, the plant will process about 6,300 tons of fruit per year&#13;
and produce about 1,000 tons of concentrated juice and 49 tons of oil. The juice will be&#13;
extracted from the fruit, clarified, concentrated to 40-45 degree brix and packed into 200&#13;
liter drums. Part of the oil will be recovered through batch solvent extraction of the seeds&#13;
(1.5 to 2.0 tons per day), and part will be separated from the juice by high speed&#13;
centrifugal separators.&#13;
20.   The project will finance about 2,400 m2 of buildings for processing, storage,&#13;
offices and utilities. Equipment will include processing, laboratory and office equipment,&#13;
and vehicles. The investment will also include a waste water treatment system and a&#13;
seabuckthorn seedling nursery. The feasibility study has been prepared by the Xian&#13;
Science Research and Design Academy under the Ministry of Domestic Trade. The total&#13;
investment cost is estimated at Y 44.7 million (excluding initial working capital).&#13;
Shuangcheng Hengda Company Limited (Corn Processing)&#13;
21.   This is a new enterprise which has been established as a limited liability company&#13;
with shareholders being Shuangcheng Hengda Industries Company (28 percent),&#13;
Henglida Biochemical Company (59 percent), and staff and management (13 percent).&#13;
The factory will be located adjacent to an existing corn starch plant that would supply the&#13;
raw material.&#13;
22.   The new enterprise would wet-mill about 40,300 tons per year of starch slurry&#13;
(70 percent water), and produce about 14,300 tons of sorbitol (70 percent) and 2,400 tons&#13;
of molasses. Sorbitol will be sold on the domestic market mainly for the production of&#13;
vitamin C and toothpaste. China currently produces about 70,000 tons of sorbitol per&#13;
year and imports a similar amount. The technical design and the feasibility report has&#13;
been prepared by Heilongjiang Chemical Engineering Design and Planning Institute. The&#13;
project will finance the construction of about 11,500 m2 of buildings for the processing&#13;
workshop, warehouse and utilities. The investment would include processing equipment,&#13;
a waste water treatment system, vehicles, training, and incremental working capital. The&#13;
total investment is estimated at Y 129.3 million (excluding initial working capital).&#13;
Suihua City Rice Comprehensive Processing Company&#13;
23.   The existing rice mill was established in 1951, and the company at present has six&#13;
subsidiaries (grain trading and processing). The plant processes some 30,000 tons of&#13;
paddy into low quality rice per year. The rice milling plant is operating below nominal&#13;
capacity due to better profitability in the trading operation and limited availability of&#13;
working capital. To implement the project, a new limited liability company would be&#13;
established with ownership divided between the Suihua Rice Processing Plant&#13;
(70.1 percent), staff and workers (7.5 percent), and local rice farmers (22.4 percent). It is&#13;
expected that 10,000 families in the county will be involved, each contributing as their&#13;
share 350 kg of rice valued at Y 585.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                    ANNEX2&#13;
24.   The existing rice mill will be expanded to process 60,000 tons of paddy to&#13;
produce 23,300 tons of high quality rice, 17,500 tons of rinse-free rice, 940 tons of rice&#13;
bran oil and some 17,100 tons of by-products. Improved technology, most likely&#13;
imported, will be introduced for cleaning, selecting and polishing. The processing plant&#13;
will also have a sophisticated grading system based on the color of the rice.&#13;
25.   The project will finance the main processing building and additional workshops&#13;
2&#13;
with a total floor area of about 5,100 m . The plant will have a modem packing line with&#13;
the manufacturing of plastic bags for 2.5 kg packages. The wash-free rice will be packed&#13;
with nitrogen in order to avoid oxidation. High quality rice will also be packed in 25 kg&#13;
sacks. Provision has been made for technical assistance and training for key plant&#13;
operators during commissioning and start-up. The total investment cost is estimated at&#13;
Y 75.5 million (excluding incremental working capital).&#13;
Geese Processing&#13;
26.   Seven geese processing plants in the counties of Zhaozhou, Zhaoyuan, Yian,&#13;
Nehe, Wangkui, Bayan and Zhaodong will undergo modernization and expansion. The&#13;
condition of the existing plants varies, but buildings are generally dilapidated and the&#13;
equipment is old, inadequate, and subject to frequent breakdown. Output varies from&#13;
about 70,000 to 500,000 processed geese per year. The size of the investment in each&#13;
enterprise would vary. The project will finance construction of new buildings for&#13;
slaughter lines, cold storage and down processing, offices and utilities. Equipment would&#13;
include complete slaughter, packaging and feather processing systems, refrigeration,&#13;
water, electrical and heating systems, and office equipment. A waste treatment system&#13;
will be provided. Transport would include utility vehicles and insulated trucks.&#13;
27.   Operation of the processing plants will be closely integrated with geese fattening,&#13;
which is also supported under the project. With the exception of Nehe, which will have&#13;
the capacity to process 1 million geese/year, each facility will have a design capacity of&#13;
500,000 geese/year. Output will include whole geese, cut parts and deboned meat, all&#13;
vacuum packed in plastic and frozen, and goose down with a total annual output of about&#13;
12,000 tons of meat products and about 100 tons of down. The Yian plant will be&#13;
upgraded to meet international USDA standards and will pilot the sale of geese for export&#13;
to the south east Asian market. The total investment cost is estimated at Y 123.8 million&#13;
(excluding incremental working capital).&#13;
28.   Zhaozhou Goose Processing. Two existing enterprises, the Zhaozhou Cold&#13;
Store and the Zhaozhou Feather Factory, will merge to form the Zhaozhou County&#13;
Animal Husbandry Products Development Limited Liability Company. The Zhaozhou&#13;
Cold Store is a county-owned TVE established in September 1993. Its main business is&#13;
purchase, processing and sales of animal products; currently its main production is geese&#13;
and pigs. The Zhaozhou Feather Factory was set up in September 1995 to trade in&#13;
feathers and down. It buys ungraded feathers from the cold store and other sources&#13;
within and outside the county, sells the feathers locally for other production, and exports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                    ANNEX2&#13;
the down. The two enterprises currently operate with separate accounts, but these will be&#13;
combined next year when the revaluation is completed and the old companies will cease&#13;
operation as independent entities. The new company has already been established on&#13;
paper as of September 1996, and the assets of the cold store have been transferred to start&#13;
the new company. The total investment cost is estimated at Y 20.6 million (excluding&#13;
incremental working capital).&#13;
29.   Zhaoyuan Goose Processing-Daqing Swan Limited Liability Co. A new&#13;
enterprise is being established for the project. The two sponsors, the Daqing City Canned&#13;
Food Factory and the Zhaoyuan Heath Food Factory, will contribute funds for the new&#13;
company, and both will continue operations. Daqing City Canned Food Factory is a&#13;
state-owned enterprise of Zhaoyuan County. It was originally established in 1956 as the&#13;
Heilongjiang Zhaoyuan Can Factory and its products were mainly exported. In 1992, it&#13;
was renamed as the Daqing City Canned Food Factory and currently operates under that&#13;
name. The Zhaoyuan Health Food Factory was established in 1988 as a collective under&#13;
the Rural Industry Bureau. The new enterprise planned to register in December 1996&#13;
after asset revaluation of the existing companies. It will have paid-in capital of Y 4.17&#13;
million from the following sources: Daqing Canned Food (50 percent); Zhaoyuan Health&#13;
Food (30 percent); and employee shareholders (20 percent). The total investment cost is&#13;
estimated to be Y 18.3 million (excluding incremental working capital).&#13;
30.   Yian Goose Processing. Qiqihar Swan Food Group, the sponsor, is a group&#13;
company with wholly owned subsidiaries (meat processing, feather processing, food&#13;
processing, cold store and hatchery) and parts of three other independent legal entities (a&#13;
biological medicine plant, a chemical plant, and a department store). These were all&#13;
combined into the Qiqihar Swan Food Group as a limited liability company, registered in&#13;
January 1996 with paid-in capital of Y 7.38 million of which Y 7.3 million represented&#13;
the state share and Y 0.08 million as employee's share. The Group plans to become a&#13;
shareholding company and has obtained the approval of the System Reform Commission&#13;
to do so. The total investment cost is estimated to be Y 15.2 million (excluding&#13;
incremental working capital).&#13;
31.   Nehe Goose Processing. The Nehe Food Group Corporation spun off parts of&#13;
three subsidiaries (an existing meat company, a can factory, and a food factory) to&#13;
establish the Nehe City Meat Packing Fowl and Feather Company Ltd., with registered&#13;
capital of Y 3.74 million. Ownership of the company is divided between the Nehe Food&#13;
Group Corporation (44 percent) and staff and other investors (56 percent). The total&#13;
investment cost is estimated to be Y 19.6 million (excluding incremental working&#13;
capital).&#13;
32.   Wangkui Goose Processing. Wangkui is a collective enterprise established in&#13;
1989 under the county government and operated as part of the County Supply and&#13;
Marketing Company. There are no subsidiaries. Its main business is processing of geese&#13;
and down and manufacture of clothing. Under the project, the enterprise would change&#13;
its ownership structure to a limited liability company in line with the provincial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                    ANNEX2&#13;
government's enterprise reform program. The total investment cost is estimated to be&#13;
Y 9.7 million (excluding incremental working capital).&#13;
33.   Bayan County Poultry.  The Bayan Poultry Company Limited Liability&#13;
Company was set up in 1994 from the Livestock Processing Company originally&#13;
established in 1988. The factory will stop operation as soon as construction starts, as the&#13;
old site will be cleared for the new facility. Equipment is outdated and most of the fixed&#13;
assets are in the cold store, which will be kept. Current ownership is divided between the&#13;
township government (49.6 percent) and staff and investors (50.4 percent). Ownership&#13;
will be further diversified under the project by offering shares to goose farmers and down&#13;
dealers.  The total investment cost is estimated to be Y 21.2 million (excluding&#13;
incremental working capital).&#13;
34.   Zhaodong Goose Processing-Zhaodong Silver Goose Limited Liability&#13;
Company. The Changwu Cold Store and the Feather Factory joined forces in 1995 to set&#13;
up a new company, the Zhaodong Silver Goose Limited Liability Company, with a paid&#13;
in capital of Y 3.549 million. Ownership is divided as follows: Cold Store (26 percent),&#13;
Down factory (67 percent), and staff shares ( 7 percent). Further diversification will take&#13;
place under the project with the sale of shares to goose farmers and staff. The total&#13;
investment cost is estimated to be Y 19.2 million (excluding incremental working&#13;
capital).&#13;
Anda Milk Processing Plant&#13;
35.   The Hong Xin Group was established in 1995 as a privately owned group held by&#13;
four individuals. The Anda Dairy, the core enterprise in the group, had been established&#13;
in 1956 (one of 156 projects set up with Russian assistance). Over the course of some&#13;
years, Anda Dairy helped to set up dairy plants in Albania and Viet Nam, and trained&#13;
5,600 technicians for the dairy industry in China. Starting in 1984, with the competition&#13;
of more dairies in China and also imported products, the plant began to have financial&#13;
difficulties. By 1993, the plant was nearly bankrupt, and Anda City decided to lease the&#13;
plant to the manager, Mr. Huang Zeng Li. In October 1995, after revaluation of the&#13;
assets, the ownership was transferred to Mr. Huang. The staff of the company was&#13;
reduced from 1,100 to 548-200 people resigned and 300 retired people were removed&#13;
from the payroll and shifted to the provincial pension program. Under his ownership,&#13;
production and profitability have been restored to the dairy.&#13;
36.   Anda is located in the main milk producing region of the province. The plant&#13;
maintains it's own milk collection stations equipped with cooling tanks and a fleet of&#13;
milk trucks, and collects up to 100,000 liters of fresh milk per day during the peak&#13;
season. The plant receives about 23,000 tons of milk per year, most of which is&#13;
processed into full cream milk powder with 20 percent sugar added.&#13;
37.   The project will finance a new processing line for ultra heat treated (UHT) milk&#13;
with a capacity of 6,000 tons/year. The main market for UHT milk will be the urban&#13;
areas in the coastal region of southern China where there is an increasing demand for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -                    ANNEX2&#13;
liquid milk. The plant will be extended by construction of 2,700 m2 of buildings for a&#13;
workshop and warehouse at the existing site. The investment will include processing&#13;
equipment, including a sterilizer and plastic bottling machine to be supplied as an&#13;
integrated package, and vehicles. The existing waste water treatment system will be&#13;
expanded and improved. The total investment cost is estimated at Y 60.4 million&#13;
(excluding incremental working capital).&#13;
Hulan Pig Abattoir and Meat Processing Plant&#13;
38.   The Kangjian Food Station, a state-owned enterprise, has been transformed to the&#13;
Kangjian Limited Liability Co. with registered capital of Y 720,000 and licensed in&#13;
February 1996. The company has held two meetings of shareholders (of which there are&#13;
six). When the project is constructed, the books of the old Company would be closed out&#13;
and the accounts taken over by the new company. The new shareholding company would&#13;
expand its operation under the project and have a ownership distribution including&#13;
Kangjian Food Co. (86 percent), staff and workers (12.3 percent), and other investors&#13;
(traders) (1.7 percent).&#13;
39.   The existing small abattoir is run down and will be replaced with a new&#13;
slaughterhouse with a capacity of 200,000 pigs per year and a 500 ton cold store. The&#13;
new facility will be built and equipped to international standards. Buildings covering&#13;
some 4,500 m would be constructed for the slaughterhouse, meat processing area, cold&#13;
store and utility rooms, and a comprehensive waste treatment system would be installed.&#13;
Equipment would include a complete mechanized slaughter line, processing, packaging&#13;
and freezing equipment, air-conditioning and office equipment, electrical, water and&#13;
steam supply and distribution systems. Refrigerated trucks and other small vehicles, and&#13;
working capital would also be provided. The enterprise will market a range of meat&#13;
products totaling about 10,250 tons per year, including whole carcasses, sausages and&#13;
pasteurized sandwich ham, catering to increasingly sophisticated urban consumers in&#13;
China. Export markets in southeast Asia and the CIS would also be targeted. The total&#13;
investment cost is estimated at Y 35.1 million (excluding incremental working capital).&#13;
Binxian County Cattle Abattoir&#13;
40.   The sponsor, Harbin Chang An Group Company, is a privately held group with all&#13;
shares owned by individuals. There are 14 member companies in the group-the group&#13;
owns all or part of the member companies and reports paid in capital of Y 48.67 million,&#13;
of which Y 38.6 million represents the Group's ownership. About half of these members&#13;
companies were established or acquired in 1996. The largest of the enterprises is the An&#13;
Te Furniture Company with paid in capital of Y 13.87 million-it is a joint venture with&#13;
a Japanese partner (25 percent). The main business of the group is wood products-&#13;
furniture, chopsticks-the foreign partner does not take dividends, but buys the product.&#13;
Profits have been used for technical reform of the chopstick factory, which the owners&#13;
claim is the largest in the world. One member of the group, the Xin Bin Industry Co.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                    ANNEX2&#13;
Ltd., would be expanded under the project from its present rendering facility to allow&#13;
slaughter of beef. This company represents 36 percent of Chang An Group's assets.&#13;
41.   A new cattle slaughterhouse and meat processing facility will be established some&#13;
36 kilometers from Harbin. The enterprise will be a shareholding company in which the&#13;
privately owned Qong An Enterprise Company, established in 1982, will be the major&#13;
shareholder. The plant will have a capacity of 30,000 beef cattle per year and will be able&#13;
to process up to 200 cattle per day during the peak season. The enterprise would produce&#13;
about 5,000 tons of meat per year. About 4,500 m2 of buildings would be constructed for&#13;
the slaughterhouse, cold stores, pump house and office. The project would finance a&#13;
mechanized slaughter line, processing and cold storage equipment, and four refrigerated&#13;
trucks. A comprehensive waste water treatment system and working capital would also&#13;
be provided. The total investment cost is estimated at Y 49.0 million (excluding initial&#13;
working capital).&#13;

Base Conditions&#13;
1.    The basic model used in the analysis is for a 2 ha farm, of which 1.6 ha is cropped&#13;
annually to maize (1 ha), soybean (0.4 ha) and wheat (0.2 ha). Farm labor availability is&#13;
estimated at 500 person days, of which about 200 are used for crop production. The&#13;
addition of a livestock activity to the farm raises crop yields by up to 5 percent through the&#13;
introduction of additional manure to the farming system and reduces the requirement for&#13;
chemical fertilizers.&#13;
Crop                           Yield w/o project (t/ha)&#13;
Maize                                               7.5&#13;

Pig Breeding and Production&#13;
3.    Pig Breeding. The model assumes a 19 sow/one boar piggery. Pure lean breed&#13;
stock would be housed in separate stalls in a 132 m2 building. Sows would be purchased at&#13;
6-8 months and 80-100 kg live weight. Other investments include a 15 m  feed shed,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
feeding equipment, a hand cart and a spray unit. Sows would be fed a base mix of corn,&#13;
wheat bran and soybean meal fed in an approximately 5:3:1 ratio, supplemented with a&#13;
vitamin/mineral mix, salt limestone and bonemeal. All sow feed would be mixed on-farm&#13;
using own resources where available. The project investment model estimates an annual&#13;
production of 17 weaned and vaccinated 18-20 kg piglets per sow per year sold to farmers&#13;
at Y 220 each. Piglets would consume 25 kg of a commercial piglet ration through to&#13;
weaning. Sows would be replaced every other year and boars (one boar to 19 sows) every&#13;
three years. Provision has been made in the budget for veterinary care, utilities and&#13;
livestock insurance (5 percent of the value of the animals). Working capital, estimated at&#13;
Y 20,820 is capitalized into the loan. Incremental labor input has been estimated at 340&#13;
person days per year. It is estimated that 341 specialized households would be involved in&#13;
pig breeding.&#13;
4.    Pig Fattening-10 Head. Piglets, purchased at 18-20 kg liveweight, would be&#13;
housed in a facility providing 2.35 m2 per head including walkways.  Additional&#13;
investments would include an 11.5 m feed store room, feed utensils, sterilizing equipment,&#13;
and a hand cart. Working capital of Y 4030, covering one cycle of production, would be&#13;
provided and capitalized into the loan. Pigs would be fed a base mix of corn, soybean cake,&#13;
and soybean meal in an approximate 16:4:1 ratio, supplemented with a vitamin/mineral&#13;
mix, salt and bonemeal. The estimated feed conversion ratio is 3.7:1, with all feed mixed&#13;
on the farm. Animals would be fattened in two cycles of 10 pigs each per year to 100 kg&#13;
liveweight with estimated 5 percent losses. Sale price is assumed to be Y 7.7/kg. Provision&#13;
is made for veterinary treatment, utility costs and livestock insurance. Incremental labor is&#13;
estimated at 90 person days per year. Availability of animal manure is expected to lead to&#13;
production increases of 10 percent for wheat. Projected production is based on participation&#13;
of 1,837 families.&#13;
5.    Pig Fattening-20 Head. Piglets, purchased at 18-20 kg liveweight, would be&#13;
housed in a facility providing 2.25 m2 per head including walkways. Additional investment&#13;
is the same as for the 10 head piggery. Working capital of Y 8,124 (covering one cycle of&#13;
production) would be provided and capitalized into the loan. The same feeding regimen,&#13;
conversion ratios, and output assumptions as for the 10 head model are adopted.&#13;
Incremental labor is estimated at 140 person days per year. Availability of animal manure&#13;
is expected to lead to 5 percent increase in maize, soybean and wheat production. It is&#13;
assumed that 1,837 families would participate.&#13;
Cattle Fattening&#13;
6.    Cattle Fattening-10 Head. The project would provide for construction of&#13;
housing (6 m2 per head including walkways), a 10 m2 feed store, a green silage pit of about&#13;
21 m3 capacity and a hand cart. Groups of up to 30 farmers would collectively own a&#13;
motorized maize stover chopper. Working capital of Y 15,090 would be provided to cover&#13;
the operating cost of the first full year of operation. Cattle would be purchased between&#13;
weaning and yearling age at 200 kg liveweight and reared to 425-450 kg over a 230 day&#13;
period (0.9-1.0 kg/day) for sale at Y 9/kg. Feed rations, on a dry matter basis, would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
include maize silage (24 percent), grass hay (22.5 percent), brewers/distillers waste&#13;
(22.5 percent), maize  grain  (15.5  percent), soybean  cake  (15.5 percent), and&#13;
vitamin/minerals (2 percent). Feed conversion rates have been estimated at 7.8 kg dry feed&#13;
intake for 1 kg liveweight gain. All animals would be vaccinated and drenched on arrival.&#13;
A 25 percent spread on liveweight buying and selling price, and a margin of 5 percent for&#13;
losses has been allowed. Livestock insurance and building operation and maintenance costs&#13;
have been included. Incremental labor input is estimated at 160 person days per year.&#13;
Availability of animal manure is expected to lead to production increases of 5 percent in&#13;
corn, soybean and wheat. It is estimated that 2,160 farm families would participate.&#13;
7.    Cattle Fattening-20 Head. The project would provide for construction of&#13;
housing (5 m2 per head including walkways), a 10 m2 feed store, a green silage pit of&#13;
about 42 m3 capacity and a hand cart. Groups of up to 30 farmers would collectively own&#13;
a motorized maize stover chopper. Working capital of Y 30,180 would be provided to&#13;
cover the operating cost of the first full year of operation. Other production parameters as&#13;
for the smaller herd apply. Incremental labor input is estimated at 300 person days per&#13;
year. Availability of animal manure is expected to lead to production increases of&#13;
10 percent in corn, soybean and wheat. This model is assumed to apply to 5,045 farm&#13;
families.&#13;
Dairy Farming&#13;
8.    Two and four cow dairy farm models are proposed. In all cases, farmers would&#13;
supply product to local milk collection plants.&#13;
9.    The project would provide 2-4 in-calf two year old heifers, a bam providing 10 m2&#13;
space per animal for 4-cow bams and 15.4 m2 for 2-cow bams, a 9.4 m  feed shed, a silage&#13;
pit of 14.7 m3 (for 2 cows) or 21.2 m3 (for 4 cows), milk cans and a hand cart. Groups of up&#13;
to 30 farmers would share a motorized maize stover chopper. Larger associations of about&#13;
40 participating farmers would share a mini tractor. Working capital covering up to&#13;
12.5 percent of the first full year's operating cost would be provided and capitalized into the&#13;
loan. The models are based on first calving at 30 months, a 14-month calving interval, and&#13;
an average lactational yield of 5,000 liters, with 500 liters for the calf and 4,500 liters&#13;
commercial production. Milk is priced at Y 1.5/liter. Principal feed inputs would include&#13;
corn, maize silage, grass hay, soybean cake and distillers waste. Livestock Production&#13;
Efficiency Calculator software (proprietary software developed by Pan Livestock, Reading&#13;
University, UK) has been used to determine herd feed requirements. Allowance has been&#13;
made for utilities, breeding and veterinary costs. Insurance against loss of cattle has been&#13;
included at 5 percent of stock value to minimize risk for low income participants.&#13;
Incremental labor inputs are estimated at 40 person days of female labor and 25 person days&#13;
of male labor per cow per year. The availability of animal manure is expected to lead to&#13;
production increases of 5 percent for soybean and wheat in each model and increases of&#13;
5 percent for corn in the four cow models, respectively. Estimated production is based on&#13;
the assumption that 1,870 families would raise two cows and 4.565 families would raise&#13;
four cows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-87 -                      ANNEX 6&#13;
Goose Production&#13;
10.   The project would establish a vertically integrated goose breeding program and&#13;
expand/improve existing smallholder goose fattening programs. The breeding program&#13;
would include the maintenance and continuous performance testing of one Grandparent&#13;
(GP) line of an imported meat-type goose (the Laine) and one GP line of an indigenous high&#13;
fertility meat-type goose (the Liaoning Fissured-eye). The central breeding program would&#13;
also monitor the performance of other domestic goose lines as part of a provincial research&#13;
program. Parent Laine and Fissured-eye stock would be sold as vaccinated chicks to&#13;
smallholder crossbreeding farmers who would in turn sell crossbred eggs to county&#13;
hatcheries. These hatcheries would sell vaccinated crossbred stock to project smallholder&#13;
goose farmers in lots of 100 to 200 head. In the financial analysis of the aggregated goose&#13;
project, the provincial breeding program has been treated as a production cost and the&#13;
crossbreeding and hatchery programs as intermediary goods. Only the benefits of the&#13;
smallholder fattening farms are treated as project benefits.&#13;
11.   A critical component of this supply chain will be the pricing of the three main&#13;
products--parent breeding stock, crossbred eggs, and goslings. For this analysis, these&#13;
products have been priced at levels above existing market prices on the basis of their&#13;
improved quality and productivity; prices used are internally consistent and allow profit at&#13;
each stage. The production advantages from this new technology would likely lead to early&#13;
adoption by farmers.&#13;
12.   Provincial Parent Breeding Program. The  Center would raise GP lines of&#13;
imported Laine and domestic Fissured Eye geese and breed and sell Parent stock of both&#13;
lines to specialized household goose cross-breeders. The Center would include GP rearing&#13;
(3,900 m ) and housing (4,400 m ) sheds, a feed store/mixing shed (150 m2), a farm office&#13;
(160 m2), a hatchery (250 m2), boiler room (30 m 2), and a power substation (20 m2). The&#13;
buildings would be enclosed by a perimeter wall (850 m) and a biological fence (7 km)&#13;
would be constructed to protect the grazing area. Farm access and internal transport roads&#13;
(6,000 m2) would also be constructed. Provision has been made for the purchase of&#13;
15 incubators of 10,000 egg capacity each, 5 rearing chambers, generators, boiler, vehicles&#13;
and miscellaneous farm tools and equipment. Initial breeding stock, to be purchased over&#13;
two years, includes 4,800 Laine GP goslings and 12,800 Fissured Eye GP goslings. The&#13;
working capital requirement, spread over two years and capitalized into the loan, will be&#13;
Y 1.64 million (base cost). The Center will produce about 296,000 Parent goslings for sale&#13;
at Y 25 each to specialized crossbreeding households.&#13;
13.   Smallholder Crossbreeding. The project would provide for construction of a&#13;
cement floored goose shed (62.5 m ) to house 250 Parent breeding stock (purchased from&#13;
the Center), together with necessary feeders, waterers, disease control equipment and farm&#13;
tools. Working capital spread over two years would amount to Y 7,000 per farm and would&#13;
be capitalized into the loan. The model provides for 6 percent loss and 80 eggs produced&#13;
per goose per year, of which 52 (65 percent) would be produced in the breeding season.&#13;
The cross-breeding farm would produce 15,040 eggs annually, of which an estimated 8,310&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
would be sold (Y 2.2 each) to county hatcheries for setting. Breeding stock would be held&#13;
for 270 days and replaced annually. Parent stock would be maintained in pens (not grazed&#13;
for health reasons) and would be fed a proprietary goose feed mix (100 gm/day) together&#13;
with cut forage. The crossbreeding enterprise would employ an estimated 250 days of labor&#13;
per year. It is assumed that 970 specialized households will participate.&#13;
14.   County Hatcheries. Each hatchery would include a 234 m2 hatchery, office&#13;
(50 m 2), garage (50 m2), generator room (20 m 2) and perimeter wall (150 m). The hatchery&#13;
would accommodate sixteen 10,000 egg incubators, 4 rearing chambers, and would be&#13;
supplied with egg transportation equipment and a communications system. The project&#13;
would also provide for generators, transformer, vehicles, utility connection and equipment&#13;
installation. The annual output is estimated at 520,720 crossbred goslings per year. The&#13;
hatchery would employ a manager, 7 technicians, and 250 person months of casual labor&#13;
per year. Nine counties would receive hatcheries.&#13;
15.   Goose Fattening-100 and 200 Head Farms.  Immature crossbred stock,&#13;
purchased from county-based hatcheries at a price of Y 5.5 each, would be fed&#13;
1.5 kg/head of a premixed goose starter over the first month, after which they would be&#13;
grazed daily and fed corn meal (about 4 kg/bird) or an equivalent agricultural by-product&#13;
supplement, dependent on availability. Under improved management, the ration is likely&#13;
to also include soybean cake or wheat bran and bone meal. Corn and potato leaf and&#13;
vegetable tops will also be used as a forage supplement. By the slaughter age of 5-6&#13;
months, geese would weight 4 kg. Finished birds, slaughtered in October/November,&#13;
would fetch a price of Y 6/kg. It is expected that 33,300 farm families would participate&#13;
in the project, with the 100 and 200 head farms evenly divided between participants.&#13;
Fox Production&#13;
16.   An existing privately operated nucleus fox breeding farm would be upgraded and&#13;
expanded. The nucleus farm will supply 1,800 breeding foxes annually to contract&#13;
smallholder fox breeders. As the contract breeders are not directly supported by the project,&#13;
their benefits have not been included in the financial analysis.&#13;
17.   Fox Breeding Stud Farm.  Investments would include fox rearing sheds&#13;
(5,000 m2), feed processing workshop (162 m2), feed warehouse (112 m2), feed cold store&#13;
(144 m2), veterinary clinic (40 m2), substation (20 m2), pump (20 mi2) and boiler houses&#13;
2        (o2                    2&#13;
(40 mi), garage (90 in), guard room (48 mi), offices (94 m) and farmer training center&#13;
(58 m2). The production unit would be enclosed by a brick security wall (I km) and&#13;
serviced by a sealed access road. Provision is also made for drainage and septic tanks.&#13;
Equipment inputs would include a set of feed processing equipment, 5,000 fox pens built to&#13;
EU standards, veterinary and simple laboratory equipment and supplies, skin framing&#13;
equipment, office equipment, work clothes, and utilities. Provision is made for 400&#13;
imported stud silver foxes. Allowance is also made for staff training and 12-person months&#13;
of national expert technical assistance. Working capital, capitalized into the loan, would&#13;
amount to Y 9.69 million, split over the first two years. Breeding sets of four females and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -                    ANNEX6&#13;
one male would be kept. Breeding stock would be fed 0.5 kg of farm-prepared feed daily.&#13;
Annual production is estimated at 7 immature foxes per breeding female, each producing a&#13;
skin valued at Y 750. Provision is also made for utilities, veterinary care and equipment&#13;
and building maintenance.  Breeding sets would be kept for three seasons before&#13;
replacement. Labor inputs are 3 management positions, 17 permanent labor positions and&#13;
79-person years of casual labor annually.&#13;

c/ While most project analysis in China values rural unskilled labor at the prevailing&#13;
market wage, this analysis uses the nominal wage in project areas adjusted by a&#13;
conversion factor of 0.90. This shadow wage reflects the fact that Heilongjiang&#13;
continues to face significant distortions in its internal labor market, as it has not&#13;
benefited from the loosening of rural-urban migration, the rapid growth of rural non-state&#13;
enterprises, and the consequent greater labor mobility found in the more developed&#13;
labor markets of southern and eastern China. As a result, except for the peak seasons&#13;
of planting and harvesting, there is a surplus of agricultural workers with little alternative&#13;
employment opportunities, leading to a marginal value product of labor below market&#13;
wages during the off-season when many project activities are implemented.&#13;
d/ Other conversion factors are calculated based on the estimated&#13;
economic prices and the prices used in the cost budget.&#13;

Varieties deemed to be superior as a result of the comparative trials would be moved into a&#13;
program  investigating cost effective management strategies.  From  there, successful&#13;
varieties would move to a nucleus flock selection program within which subjectively&#13;
identified superior birds would be selected and moved into a nucleus flock for further&#13;
objective evaluation. Objectively assessed superior birds would be moved from the nucleus&#13;
flock for use in the breeding goose program.&#13;
23.   Pasture Research Program. The value of Heilonjiang's vast pasture resource is&#13;
diminished by its relatively low quality, particularly when it is stored (either as hay or&#13;
silage) for winter feed. The low level of leguminous fodder in the native sward is the&#13;
primary reason for the diminished feed value. Attempts at the introduction of improved&#13;
legumes have been largely focused on the introduction of perennial legumes of which only&#13;
alfalfa (Medicago sativa) has proven broadly successful.  The intense cold of the&#13;
Heilongjiang winter and relative lack of snow may explain, at least in part, the failure of&#13;
many perennial leguminous species. A range of annual legumes grow at high altitude in&#13;
Africa and South America. Annual legumes with high seeding rates and early spring&#13;
growth characteristics may meet critical protein gaps in the feed base during the hay and&#13;
silage making seasons.&#13;
24.   While there has been substantial research on the establishment and management of&#13;
local grass species and on the management of indigenous soil types, pasture establishment&#13;
costs, particularly for alfalfa, are exacerbated by ploughing and full land preparation&#13;
expenses. Inefficient machinery with poor seed delivery and placement exacerbates these&#13;
costs. Scientists and farmers alike are largely unaware of mechanical oversowing and&#13;
spray/plant techniques.&#13;
25.   The research program would run comparative field trials for indigenous, and&#13;
introduce annual and selected perennial pasture legumes across all major soil types and&#13;
agroecological zones in the project area. A parallel legume and grass species establishment&#13;
trial would be conducted to test least cost establishment techniques using imported direct&#13;
seeding and locally modified seed drills. Standard fertilizer packages would be applied to&#13;
all species within each agroecological zone/soil type; however, successfully tested species&#13;
would be further tested for tolerance of low fertility and special soil conditions.&#13;

ANNEX 7B: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR A LIVESTOCK&#13;
PROCESSING STUDY&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Heilongjiang Agricultural Development Project is being implemented by the&#13;
Heilongjiang Provincial Government and supported by the World Bank. The project&#13;
includes investments in livestock and poultry development and processing enterprises.&#13;
Designs and management of the livestock and poultry processing enterprises will&#13;
incorporate modem standards of hygiene and environmental control; standards which are&#13;
not being uniformly applied in the meat processing sector in the Province.&#13;
2.   Inspections carried out during preparation of the project showed that neither&#13;
public health nor pollution control rules and regulations are being uniformly enforced in&#13;
the livestock and poultry processing sectors with the result that heavy pollution is&#13;
occurring and that meat products are sometimes being processed in extremely unhygienic&#13;
conditions which could be creating public health problems.&#13;
3.   If these deficiencies are allowed to persist, they will almost certainly disadvantage&#13;
the financial viability of livestock and poultry processing enterprises financed under the&#13;
project. Therefore, it is proposed, as part of the project, to carry out a study of&#13;
environmental and hygiene standards currently being applied in the meat processing&#13;
sector within the Province and to make recommendations on options available for&#13;
improving standards throughout the sector.&#13;
4.    These Terms of Reference outline the scope of work of the proposed study.&#13;
Background&#13;
5.    Both the State and Provincial Governments in China are concerned about&#13;
standards of management and operation in the livestock and poultry processing sectors.&#13;
In December 1995, the General Office of the State Council issued a directive entitled&#13;
Emergency Notice on Strengthening Anti-epidemic Administration Activities of Livestock&#13;
and Poultry Slaughtering, which required all Provinces to improve management and&#13;
correctly apply rules and regulations already in existence, such as the State Council's&#13;
Anti-epidemic Regulations and Rules on Livestock and Poultry and Notice by the General&#13;
Office of the State Council on the Relevant Problems Concerning the Administration of&#13;
Livestock and Poultry Slaughtering.&#13;
6.   In response to the State Council's Directive of December 1995, the Heilongjiang&#13;
Provincial Government set up an Administrative Activities Leading Group to investigate&#13;
compliance with rules and regulations and strengthen supervision. As a result of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102 -                        ANNEX7B&#13;
activities of the leading group, it is reported that in 1996 some 427 private&#13;
slaughterhouses were closed down, 365 replacement enterprises were established, and six&#13;
processing plants and abattoirs were renovated.&#13;
7.    Nevertheless, it seems that the Provincial Government's action to date has focused&#13;
on tightening up administration of existing laws and regulations and within the existing&#13;
regulatory framework. As far as it is known, the government has not considered whether:&#13;
(a) the problems being experienced in administration have anything to do with the&#13;
allocation of supervisory powers under the existing regulatory framework (e.g., whether&#13;
supervisory responsibility is too diffusely distributed, whether any of the supervisory&#13;
agencies have any conflicts of interest that may be limiting their objectivity, whether&#13;
supervisory responsibility is vested in the "right" agency (or agencies); and (b) the&#13;
current regulations are adequate to underwrite a modern, hygienic meat processing&#13;
industry, even if they were being followed.&#13;
8.    The proposed study, which will be carried out under the direction of the&#13;
Provincial Project Management office is intended to assist the governnent to answer&#13;
these questions.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
9.    The consultants will carry out research and field investigations with a view to&#13;
covering the following issues:&#13;
(a)    Sectoral Overview:   Prepare an inventory of livestock processing&#13;
enterprises within the Province based on a suitable classification regarding&#13;
type and size of operation, estimate total scale of production, and outline&#13;
recent development trends (e.g., trends in the type, size and ownership of&#13;
processing operations);&#13;
(b)    Regulatory Overview. Identify the agencies responsible for regulation of&#13;
both in-plant hygienic standards and pollution control within the industry,&#13;
the regulatory specifications they are required to enforce, identify the&#13;
resources available to police the regulations, the level of effort applied to&#13;
policing the regulations, the professional/technical abilities of regulatory&#13;
staff, identify areas of overlap and conflict, identify areas where&#13;
regulations should be improved, identify training requirements, etc.;&#13;
(c)    Sample Audit of Livestock Processing Enterprises. Based on the sectoral&#13;
overview, select a random sample of enterprises for detailed inspection of&#13;
plant designs, operating procedures, in-plant waste water reduction, waste&#13;
water flows, waste water quality, and waste water treatment with a view to&#13;
identify areas for improvement of plant design, operations and treatment&#13;
systems;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103 -                      ANNEX7B&#13;
(d)   Findings and Recommendations. Based on the preceding, prepare a report&#13;
recommending a strategy for improving standards of hygiene and&#13;
environmental control in the sector including aspects such as changes in&#13;
regulations, changes in regulatory structure and/or procedures, training of&#13;
regulators and industry operators, development of simple in-plant&#13;
pollution minimization procedures, design and operation of simple waste&#13;
water treatment systems.&#13;
10.   At the completion of the research and investigations and following preparation of&#13;
a draft report, the consultants will hold a workshop in Harbin, to be attended by relevant&#13;
representatives of both the industry and regulators, to discuss their draft findings and&#13;
recommendations and provide a basis for finalization of the report.&#13;
11.   The final report will be submitted to the Provincial Government and the Bank.&#13;
Study Team&#13;
12.  It is envisaged that the study would be carried out by team of both foreign and&#13;
local experts.  The local experts would carry out the basic research, document&#13;
procurement and organize translations of the most relevant materials, and then participate&#13;
with the foreign expert in field inspections, meetings with relevant officials and drafting&#13;
of the findings and recommendations.&#13;
13.   Team  Leader/Meat Industry Specialist-Foreign (two person months).&#13;
Engineer or agricultural scientist with a minimum of 15 years experience in the meat&#13;
processing sector relevant to the tasks set down in the terms of reference.  Some&#13;
experience in a relevant regulatory agency would be an advantage as would some&#13;
experience in China or other developing countries.&#13;
14.   Environmental Engineer/Waste Water Treatment Specialist-National (two&#13;
person months).  Environmental engineer/waste water treatment engineer with a&#13;
minimum of 10 years relevant experience including design and commissioning of waste&#13;
water treatment plants and compliance with Chinese environmental standards.&#13;
15.   Meat Industry Specialist-National (two person months).  Engineer or&#13;
scientist with a minimum of 10 years experience in the food processing sector relevant to&#13;
the tasks set down in the terms of reference.&#13;
Budget&#13;
16.   The total budget including consultant's fees, travel and accommodation,&#13;
document procurement and translation, project management and report preparation is&#13;
Y 500,000.&#13;
&#13;

-104 -                     ANNEX8&#13;
ANNEX 8: RESETTLEMENT GUIDELINES&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Based on the Government's and the Bank's review of subprojects proposed for&#13;
financing, resettlement necessitated by the project is limited to the agroprocessing&#13;
component where 4 ha of land would be acquired for three new enterprises. A Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared in full consultation with the concerned households,&#13;
reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable, and has been placed in the Project File&#13;
(Annex 10). Should additional subprojects involving land acquisition be selected during&#13;
project implementation, the Chinese Government and the World Bank have agreed on the&#13;
following guidelines to insure equitable and effective treatment of resettlement issues under&#13;
the project.&#13;
Legal Framework&#13;
2.    As reviewed in a recent World Bank Report on involuntary resettlement in China&#13;
(Report No. 11641-CHA), Chinese law and regulation now generally meet the requirements&#13;
of the World Bank Operational Directive on resettlement and the resettlement guidelines of&#13;
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The major laws and&#13;
regulations that bear on resettlement under the Project include the following:&#13;
(a)   The "Regulations on the Requisition of Land for State Construction" (1982)&#13;
provides for compensation based on the requirements for restoring income.&#13;
(b)   The "Land Administration Law" (1986) and related amendments (1988)&#13;
require that incomes and assets be protected during resettlement and that&#13;
affected communities be consulted during the project design stage. In&#13;
addition, resettlers are given the specific right to challenge resettlement&#13;
decisions in the courts.  The law gives affected cities, counties, and&#13;
collectives responsibility for implementing resettlement and provides&#13;
guidance on resettlement principles, organization, and compensation.&#13;
Provinces are required to draw up implementing regulations that confirm to&#13;
the national legislation, which define more precisely resettlement procedures&#13;
and compensation for various types of land and other property. Provinces&#13;
may also give cities and counties the right to enact additional resettlement&#13;
regulations conforming to national and provincial law. These local laws&#13;
have gained added significance with the decision of the State Council in&#13;
1992 and the previous blanket exemption of national projects from local&#13;
resettlement regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-105 -                       ANNEX8&#13;
(c)   National regulations pertaining to urban resettlement were published in 1984&#13;
and laid out administrative procedures for urban land acquisition and&#13;
compensation. They serve as enabling regulations for municipalities, which&#13;
then developed resettlement procedures and compensation arrangements&#13;
appropriate to their situation. The "Administrative Regulations for House&#13;
Removal in Cities" (1991) introduced updated and more comprehensive&#13;
regulations for urban resettlement. This regulation specifies: (i) consultation&#13;
requirements, including public announcements of the proposed project, to be&#13;
followed by individual consultation with affected households; (ii) grievance&#13;
procedures; and (iii) the principle of full replacement value for expropriated&#13;
housing, whether owned or rented.&#13;
Resettlement Principles for the Project&#13;
3.    The Chinese Government and the Bank have agreed on the following principles for&#13;
resettlement under the project:&#13;
*  Involuntary resettlement will be avoided or minimized where feasible; to this&#13;
end, sub-borrowers of project funds will explore all viable alternative project&#13;
designs.&#13;
*  All resettlement activities will conform  with existing Chinese laws and&#13;
regulations at the national, provincial, city and county levels.&#13;
*  Affected persons will be consulted during the planning and implementation of&#13;
resettlement activities. In particular, they will be informed of the resettlement&#13;
plans and their options and legal rights prior to the initiation of any&#13;
resettlement activity; institutionalized arrangements will be established to&#13;
facilitate communication during the planning and implementation of&#13;
resettlement; and an effective and well-understood grievance process will be&#13;
developed.&#13;
.  Affected persons will be resettled within their original village whenever&#13;
possible. If this is not possible, they will be resettled as close as possible to&#13;
their original village. The principles for selecting relocation sites will be:&#13;
(a) within the same village, (b) to adjacent villages within the same xiang;&#13;
(c) other villages within the same xiang; (d) to adjacent xiangs; (e) other&#13;
xiangs within the same counties; and (f) adjacent counties.&#13;
*  Affected persons will be resettled in similar livelihoods. Where possible,&#13;
agriculture workers will be resettled with agricultural jobs, industrial workers&#13;
will be resettled with industrial jobs. If this is not possible, affected persons&#13;
will be insured suitable employment in an endeavor other than that of their&#13;
previous employment, and will receive retraining where necessary to rend&#13;
them suitable for such employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106 -                      ANNEX8&#13;
.  Affected persons will be resettled as groups whenever possible to reduce&#13;
social disruptions.&#13;
*  Valuation of lost assets will be made at full replacement cost.&#13;
*  The total level of compensation will insure that the living standards, income&#13;
earning capacity, and production levels are improved, or, at least, do not&#13;
deteriorate as a result of their resettlement.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
4.    Organizational Responsibilities. The project's executive agency, the Provincial&#13;
Project Management Office (PPMO) in the Heilongjiang Planning Commission will have&#13;
overall responsibility for supervising and monitoring the implementation of all resettlement&#13;
plans. The PPMO will be assisted by the local resettlement authorities, comprising the local&#13;
Land Administration Bureaus, Land Valuation Bureaus, Village, Municipal, Township or&#13;
County government with authority over the subproject site. The subprojects' management&#13;
teams will be responsible for the preparation and approval process, and monitoring of&#13;
resettlement plans.  These teams will act on behalf of the subprojects' sponsoring&#13;
enterprises. The implementation of all resettlement plans will be subject to the approval&#13;
and clearance of such plans by the relevant local authorities. The PPMO will coordinate&#13;
closely with these authorities with respect to the monitoring of approved resettlement plans.&#13;
5.    Where resettlement will be part of a subproject proposal, the PPMO, in consultation&#13;
with the Provincial Finance Bureau, would approve subloans conditional on submission by&#13;
the subproject sponsor of a resettlement plan meeting principles and procedures satisfactory&#13;
to the PPMO, local authorities, and the Bank. The resettlement plan's scope would be&#13;
consistent with agreed upon guidelines, based on the broad criteria outlined in paras. 6 and&#13;
7.&#13;
6.    Resettlement Plans. A resettlement plan will be prepared for each and every&#13;
subproject that involves land acquisition or displacement of people. The content and level&#13;
of detail of the resettlement plan will vary with the magnitude of the resettlement.&#13;
7.    When more than 200 individuals are affected in a subproject, a comprehensive&#13;
resettlement plan for that subproject will be prepared that addresses the following issues:&#13;
(a)   organizational responsibilities;&#13;
(b)   community participation and integration with host populations;&#13;
(c)   socio-economic survey;&#13;
(d)   legal framework;&#13;
(e)   alternative sites and selection;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107-                        ANNEX8&#13;
(f)    valuation of and compensation for lost assets;&#13;
(g)   and tenure, acquisition, and transfer;&#13;
(h)   access to training, employment, and credit;&#13;
(i)   shelter, infrastructure, and social services;&#13;
()    enviromnental protection and management;&#13;
(k)   implementation schedule, monitoring, and evaluation; and&#13;
(1)    detailed cost estimates.&#13;
8.    When 200 or less individuals are affected in a subproject, a summary resettlement&#13;
plan for that subproject will be prepared that addresses the following issues:&#13;
(a)    organizational responsibilities;&#13;
(b)   community participation and integration with host populations;&#13;
(c)   valuation of and compensation for lost assets;&#13;
(d)   implementation schedule, monitoring, and evaluation; and&#13;
(e)    detailed cost estimates.&#13;
9.    World Bank Review of Resettlement Plans. The World Bank's prior approval of&#13;
each resettlement plan will be required.&#13;
10.   Sources of Funding for Resettlement. No funds will be made available in the&#13;
project budget for the funding of resettlement costs. These costs will be primarily borne by&#13;
the subproject's sponsor or the subproject itself. The enterprise or agency responsible for&#13;
funding will, as part of the necessary documentation for loan approval, show proof to the&#13;
PPMO it has designated the necessary funds to support the financial cost of such a plan and&#13;
that the disbursement of these funds is time-bound to the implementation schedule prepared&#13;
for the plan. The determination of resettlement costs will be based on the principles of land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement, and will be implemented in accordance with existing local&#13;
land administration and other resettlement laws, as interpreted. Where relevant, local&#13;
government agencies may contribute to resettlement costs by providing assets lost as the&#13;
result of land acquisition such as the provision of new or alternate housing, or land.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
11.   Monitoring Structure. A resettlement monitoring structure will be set up as part&#13;
of the overall project management infrastructure and will comprise, in hierarchical order,&#13;
the PPMO in the Provincial Planning Commission as the project's chief monitoring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108 -                      ANNEX8&#13;
coordinator, in collaboration with prefecture, county and municipal Project Management&#13;
Offices (PMOs). The PPMO will receive approved resettlement plans, other relevant data,&#13;
and progress reports directly from the lower level PMOs. Resettlement monitoring will&#13;
provide an early warning system for project managers via the PPMO, which would insure&#13;
information objectivity through direct, in-house monitoring. A channel for resettlers to&#13;
make known their needs would be established, from the local authorities or the subproject&#13;
monitoring unit, directly to the PPMO. Monitoring progress reports would be submitted by&#13;
subproject management units to the local PMO and forwarded up to the PPMO, as part of&#13;
the routine semi-annual subproject progress reporting. During the first year of subproject&#13;
implementation, the PPMO will have the right, where warranted, to request more frequent&#13;
progress update reports.  Baseline and implementation socioeconomic surveys on&#13;
resettlement plans involving over 200 persons will be carried out to compare the without&#13;
and with-subproject effects of resettlement on affected persons. Bank review of the&#13;
monitoring progress will be at semi-annual intervals during the first year of subproject&#13;
implementation and annually thereafter, throughout the project's implementation period.&#13;
12.   Monitoring indicators to be reported to the Bank will include:&#13;
(a)   Date of approval of resettlement proposals and compliance with these&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
(b)   Confirmation that subproject monitoring structure is in place.&#13;
(c)   Confirmation that communications channel for affect persons to and from&#13;
the PPMO is in place.&#13;
(d)   Target date(s) for expected resettlement benefits to resettlers.&#13;
(e)   Target date for replacement of land, where applicable.&#13;
(f)    Date(s) of occupation of new or replacement housing.&#13;
(g)   Confirmation of equal replacement value of housing or land.&#13;
*(h)   Confirmation and date(s) of allocation of replacement jobs.&#13;
(i)    Confirmation of amount of replacement salaries/income.&#13;
(j)    Confirmation and date(s) of job retraining, where relevant.&#13;
