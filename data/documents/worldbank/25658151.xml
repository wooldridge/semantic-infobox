&#13;
      In this paper, show that greater autonomy to cities in Ethiopia through a&#13;
      process of city proclamations, led to better economic outcomes at the city&#13;
      level, lowering regional spatial inequalities. In addition, the newly-&#13;
      empowered cities did not seem to misuse their new powers by favouring&#13;
      particular firms over others. We investigate the effect of a nation-wide&#13;
      introduction of VAT in Ethiopia â&#128;&#147; and show that the intended recipients of&#13;
      the reform, i.e. importing firms performed better (in terms of employment and&#13;
      sales) only after the VAT introduction in decentralized cities with greater&#13;
      autonomy than in non-decentralized cities. This is suggestive evidence that&#13;
      increasing administrative powers (or the mayorâ&#128;&#153;s wedge) played an important&#13;
      role in making Ethiopian cities more competitive, and allowed mayorâ&#128;&#153;s to&#13;
      transmit more efficiently the effect of national-level reforms.&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ability to raise taxes from firms and households to finance public goods&#13;
is a major obstacle in developing countries (Besley and Persson 2013). As workers and&#13;
firms continue to move to urban areas, the ability of city governments to raise and&#13;
administer taxes on firms has become an important channel of growth. In the last few years,&#13;
researchers have focused more on local and regional policies that lead to growth within a&#13;
country as opposed to explaining cross-country differences in GDP (Moretti, 2014).&#13;
Despite the increased focus on local policies, there have been few studies on the impact of&#13;
city governmentsâ&#128;&#153; administrative powers on firm behavior, and the gap in research is far&#13;
larger in the case of emerging countries.&#13;
In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap. First we investigate if the process of&#13;
decentralization led to worsening of spatial inequalities across cities in different regions in&#13;
Ethiopia, and if there was any evidence of misuse of the new administrative powers in&#13;
terms of favouring particular companies over others. We find that decentralization leads to&#13;
convergence across city-level economic outcomes, suggesting that worse-performing cities&#13;
started to catch-up with their better-performing counterparts after decentralization.&#13;
To illustrate our point, we use two policy changes in Ethiopia, firstly, a nationwide&#13;
introduction of the VAT (value added tax) and secondly the phase-wide roll out of city&#13;
proclamations across different regions. We test whether economic outcomes for importers&#13;
improve after the introduction of the VAT introduction, especially in cities that had&#13;
additional powers post-decentralization. Using a firm-level panel data set from Ethiopia&#13;
between 2000 and 2011, we find that importers perform better than non-importers after the&#13;
introduction of the VAT in decentralized cities. This provides evidence that cities with&#13;
greater administrative powers are better able to pass through national-level reforms to the&#13;
benefit of their business community.&#13;
This paper is related the literature on place-based policies, where different sub-national&#13;
regions provide differential benefits for firms. See for example, Chaurey (2014), Criscuolo,&#13;
Martin, Overman, and van Reenen (2012), Ham, Swenson, Imrohoroglu, and Song (2011).&#13;
Regional policies in the context of African countries have hitherto been understudied and&#13;
this paper also adds to the relatively recent literature focusing on firm-level data from&#13;
African countries â&#128;&#147; Shiferaw et.al (2013), Frazer (2005), Rijkers et al (2014). The results&#13;
of this paper are informative to the empirical literature focusing on the effects of&#13;
decentralization on local economic growth - see Hammond and Tosun (2011), Stansel&#13;
(2005) - most of which has focused on regional states in the US. To our knowledge, this is&#13;
the first paper to look at the combined impact of a tax and decentralization policy change.&#13;
Moreover, by focusing on Ethiopia, the paper provides evidence on a developing country&#13;
setting.&#13;
Furthermore, this paper provides supporting evidence about the role of importing firms&#13;
(defined as firms using imported inputs) in response to policy changes (see Goldberg, et.al&#13;
(2010) and Khandelwal and Topalova (2011). In this paper, we provide evidence for the&#13;
role of importers following a VAT introduction in Ethiopia.&#13;
&amp;#12;Background2&#13;
Ethiopia had a tradition of centralist authoritarian government until 1991. Municipal&#13;
structures were established in some cities, but the mayors were centrally appointed and&#13;
municipalities were treated as branches of central government. When the current&#13;
government came to power in 1991, it proclaimed a decentralized form of government and&#13;
developed a constitution that established a Federal Democratic Republic, consisting of nine&#13;
Regional States, the federal capital city Addis Ababa, and the special administrative region&#13;
of Dire Dawa. The government structure has four tiersâ&#128;&#148;federal, regional, woreda (or&#13;
city/municipal) and kebele (neighborhood). The nine regional states have their own&#13;
constitutions. The country has introduced a dramatic change in terms of its traditions of&#13;
governance. This legal framework has enabled more participation of the regional states in&#13;
matters that concern them.&#13;
&#13;
Each region has developed specific â&#128;&#156;City Proclamationsâ&#128;&#157; that specify the powers, duties&#13;
and responsibilities of the cities.&#13;
&#13;
Table 1: Legal and Institutional Framework for Cities&#13;
&#13;
       Addis Ababa City Government was originally established by the Addis Ababa City&#13;
       Government Charter Proclamation No 87/1997, and the proclamation revised in 2003 by&#13;
       Proclamation 361/2003.&#13;
       Dire Dawa City Administration was established by federal Charter Proclamation 416/2004.&#13;
       Amhara Regional State: Amhara passed its first City Proclamation No. 43 in 2000. The urban&#13;
       reform process in Amhara Regional State is now guided by the Revised Proclamation for the&#13;
       establishment, organization and definition of powers and duties of urban centers in the Amhara&#13;
       Region, No. 91/2003.&#13;
       Oromia Regional State passed its first City Proclamation as no. 65/2003. The revised City&#13;
       Proclamation 116/2006 now guides the urban reform process in Oromia Regional State.&#13;
       Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Regional State passed its first City proclamation as&#13;
       no. 51/2002. The urban reform process in SNNP Regional State is guided by the revised&#13;
       proclamation 103/2006.&#13;
       Tigray Regional State: Tigrayâ&#128;&#153;s first regional city proclamation was no. 65/2003. The urban&#13;
       reform process in Tigray Regional State is guided by the Tigray Regional State revised City&#13;
       Proclamation 107/2006.&#13;
       All five remaining National Regional States - Afar, Benshangul/Gumuz, Gambela, Harari and&#13;
       Somali have, in 2006/07 developed legal and institutional frameworks (City Proclamations) to&#13;
       establish local urban government authorities. Some of these have subsequently been amended&#13;
       by (number and years of City Proclamations):&#13;
       Gambela: 73/2008, Somali 90/2011, Benishangul Gumuz 69/2007.&#13;
&#13;
Under the highly centralized Derg regime (1974-1991), Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s municipalities were&#13;
marginalized and did not function as independent local authorities. Since 2000, national&#13;
decentralization policies have formed part of a large-scale reform of government resulting&#13;
2&#13;
    This section draws heavily from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Ethiopia Local Government Revenue Study (2014).&#13;
&amp;#12;in creation of institutional and legal frameworks for urban local government authorities.&#13;
The objective has been to create and strengthen urban local government that will ensure&#13;
public participation, democratization and enhance decentralized service delivery through&#13;
institutional reforms, capacity building, systems development, and training.&#13;
&#13;
In all regions, the Bureaus of Urban Development and Construction are responsible for&#13;
urban management and development issues within the regional government. All regions&#13;
that have enacted legislation creating urban local government (or city) authorities have&#13;
adopted an urban governance model that follows the elected council, elected mayor,&#13;
Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s Committee and city manager system.&#13;
&#13;
The 2000-2003 City Proclamations were developed region by region (starting with&#13;
Amhara) in a fairly robust participatory process. There was strong debate around principles&#13;
â&#128;&#147; elected mayor/non-elected, etc. In the end all regions followed, more or less, the result&#13;
arrived at in Amhara and Tigray â&#128;&#147; Amhara then revised theirs to included additions other&#13;
regions introduced. The City Declarations are therefore relatively similar in scope and&#13;
form. Generally, in principle they provide significant autonomy for cities to set their own&#13;
standards, policies, plans, budgets, etc. â&#128;&#147; but other parts of the city proclamations also&#13;
specify that the region will issue guidelines and directives.&#13;
&#13;
The basic regional legislation that regulates citiesâ&#128;&#153; powers and responsibilities is found in&#13;
the respective City Proclamations. However, various subsidiary legislations â&#128;&#147; most&#13;
importantly the â&#128;&#156;City Tariff Regulationsâ&#128;&#157; - provide more detailed guidance. The City&#13;
proclamations give only very broad and generally wide-ranging authority to the cities3. For&#13;
instance in Oromia, cities are bestowed with powers to â&#128;&#156;introduce, adjust and ensure the&#13;
collection of taxes, service charges according to lawâ&#128;&#157;, in Tigray, Gambella and&#13;
Benishangul Gumuz the cities are empowered to â&#128;&#156;determine and collect taxesâ&#128;&#157;. However,&#13;
the practice that regional governments determine local tariff and tax rates has continued&#13;
regardless and they continue to provide very detailed guidance in the form of City Tariff&#13;
Regulations. Typically the tariff regulations include a prescriptive rating of the various&#13;
urban areas within the region according to their size and economy (typically five grades).&#13;
For each of these grades of urban areas the tariff regulations will subsequently either set a&#13;
fixed rate or a band for each of the revenue sources.&#13;
&#13;
Table 2 below summarizes the extent to which the regional legislation and regulations&#13;
effectively allows each city to set its own tariff and tax rates. As indicated by the table,&#13;
there is some variation of the extent to which regions grant cities autonomy â&#128;&#147; but the&#13;
general rule is that the regions set the tariff and tax rates with limited or no autonomy for&#13;
cities to adjust rates.&#13;

 SNNP&#13;
 Oromia                    Urban Local Governments appear to have full autonomy to select a rate&#13;
                           appropriate for their circumstances and/or to introduce a new tax base&#13;
                           other than what is suggested by the regional revenue Bureau. In&#13;
                           practice, Cities decide within a recommended range established by the&#13;
                           region.&#13;
 Harari                    Special case as the City is almost the same as the state (mayor =&#13;
                           president, council, revenue office â&#128;&#147; although with separate legislation&#13;
                           for the city, urban bureau and city administration, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
Value-Added Tax (VAT) in Ethiopia was introduced nation-wide through the VAT&#13;
proclamation No. 285/2002, and came into force on 1 January, 2003. The VAT tax rate is&#13;
15% of the value of every taxable transaction - import and export services are exempt.&#13;
Since the introduction of the value-added tax in Ethiopia, firms have been differentially&#13;
impacted depending on the following categories.&#13;
&#13;
Proprietorship firm: Pays VAT at the time of import to the federal government.&#13;
   ï&#130;· If goods are sold in the domestic market, then the balance of VAT is paid at the&#13;
       urban local government level. However, sometimes a firm might be eligible for a&#13;
       refund on the VAT paid to the federal level â&#128;&#147; the refund is collected from the ULG.&#13;
   ï&#130;· If final goods are exported, then the firm receives a full refund from the ULG.&#13;
Incorporated firm: Pays VAT at the time of import to the federal government.&#13;
   ï&#130;· If goods are sold in the domestic market, then the balance of VAT is paid at the&#13;
       regional level. However, sometimes a firm might be eligible for a refund on the&#13;
       VAT paid to the federal level â&#128;&#147; the refund is collected from the regional&#13;
       government.&#13;
   ï&#130;· If final goods are exported, then the firm receives a full refund from the regional&#13;
       government.&#13;
&#13;
Thus, we hypothesize that factors such as (1) ownership (private or company), (2) status&#13;
(exporter and/or importer) and possibly (3) size, might influence the extent to which VAT&#13;
affects firm performance. Furthermore, urban local authorities handle the reimbursement&#13;
and collection of VAT. Therefore, it is plausible that cities with different levels of taxation&#13;
and governance capacities, differentially affect firm behavior. We use two exogenous&#13;
policy changes â&#128;&#147; first, the nation-wide VAT reform starting in 2003, and second, the&#13;
decentralization of powers to the city governments through the phased city proclamations&#13;
to identify the effect of the VAT reform and decentralization on firm outcomes.&#13;
&amp;#12;Data&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We use the Ethiopian Large and Medium Manufacturing and Electricity Industries Survey&#13;
collected by the Central Statistical Agency (CSA). We use the data for the years 2000-&#13;
2011. The scope of Large and Medium Manufacturing Industries Survey includes&#13;
identification particulars, number of persons engaged and wages and salaries paid (in birr),&#13;
products, sales and services of the establishment (in birr), value of stocks raw material&#13;
purchase (in birr), cost and quantity of raw materials, parts and containers used (value in&#13;
birr), fixed assets and investment (in birr), value of exports, and value of imports. The CSA&#13;
restricted the survey to establishments engaged in manufacturing activities (as defined&#13;
above) and employing more than 10 full-time employees. The survey covers both public&#13;
and private industries in all regions of the country.&#13;

Empirical Strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In this paper, we test for:&#13;
&amp;#12;1/     Whether the VAT reform implemented across Ethiopia starting 2003 differentially&#13;
impacted importing and exporting firms compared to firms that do not import and export,&#13;
and,&#13;
2/     Furthermore, whether the VAT reform affected firms differentially after the&#13;
decentralization across regions in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
Since the VAT reform was introduced all over Ethiopia in 2003, we first run a difference&#13;
in differences specification comparing importing firms to non-importing firms, and&#13;
exporting firms to non-exporting firms. In this analysis, we define an importing firm as a&#13;
firm that imports greater than 10% of its total raw materials. Similarly we define an&#13;
exporting firm as a firm that exports more than 10% of the total value of its sales. We use&#13;
regressions of the form:&#13;
&#13;
í µí±&#140;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#145;í µí±¡ = í µí»¼í µí±&#150; + í µí»½1 í µí±&#137;í µí°´í µí±&#135;í µí±¡ + í µí»½2 í µí±¡í µí±¦í µí±&#157;í µí±&#146;í µí±&#150; + í µí»½3 (í µí±&#137;í µí°´í µí±&#135;í µí±¡ Ã&#151; í µí±¡í µí±¦í µí±&#157;í µí±&#146;í µí±&#150; ) + í µí»¿í µí±¡ + í µí¼&#150;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#145;í µí±¡                              (1)&#13;
&#13;
where i represents firm, t represents year and d represents a city. í µí±&#140;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#145;í µí±¡ represents outcomes&#13;
such as log employment and log sales at the firm level, í µí»¼1 represents firm fixed effects and&#13;
í µí»¿í µí±¡ represents year fixed effects. í µí±&#137;í µí°´í µí±&#135;í µí±¡ represents an indicator variable equaling 1 after 2003&#13;
(when the VAT policy was introduced) and 0 otherwise. Similarly, í µí±¡í µí±¦í µí±&#157;í µí±&#146;í µí±&#150; represents an&#13;
indicator for an importing firm if more than 10% of its raw materials are imported, and an&#13;
indicator for an exporting firm if more than 10% of its output is exported. Then, í µí»½3, the&#13;
coefficient on the interaction between í µí±&#137;í µí°´í µí±&#135;í µí±¡ and í µí±¡í µí±¦í µí±&#157;í µí±&#146;í µí±&#150; represents the treatment effect of&#13;
interest. This coefficient gives us the magnitude of the VAT policy on importing&#13;
(exporting) firms as compared to non-importing (non-exporting) firms before and after the&#13;
policy change.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, we hypothesize that the differential effect of VAT is more pronounced in&#13;
cities after decentralization than before decentralization. We tackle this question in two&#13;
steps. The decentralization was rolled out in a phased manner across various regions in&#13;
Ethiopia. Note that in this analysis we use the year in which the revised city proclamations&#13;
took place (see Table 1). This gives us variation across geography (i.e. cities) and time. We&#13;
then compare firms of different types (importers and exporters) in cities before and after&#13;
the decentralization. In essence, we use a triple difference specification (DIDID) and run&#13;
regressions of the form:&#13;
&#13;
í µí±&#140;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#145;í µí±¡ = í µí»¼í µí±&#150; + í µí»½1 (í µí±&#157;í µí±&#156;í µí± í µí±¡í µí±¡ Ã&#151; í µí±¡í µí±&#159;í µí±&#146;í µí±&#142;í µí±¡í µí±&#159; ) + í µí»½2 (í µí±&#157;í µí±&#156;í µí± í µí±¡í µí±¡ Ã&#151; í µí±¡í µí±&#159;í µí±&#146;í µí±&#142;í µí±¡í µí±&#159; Ã&#151; í µí±¡í µí±¦í µí±&#157;í µí±&#146;í µí±&#150; ) + í µí»¾í µí±&#145; + í µí»¿í µí±¡ + í µí¼&#150;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#145;í µí±¡         (2)&#13;
&#13;
where the coefficient í µí»½2 on the triple interaction term is the treatment effect of interest,&#13;
comparing different types of firms before and after the decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
One problem that we encounter while dealing with this hypothesis is that both the VAT&#13;
reform and the initial phase of decentralization is the timing of the two events. The VAT&#13;
was introduced in 2003 across Ethiopia, and the first phase of city proclamations were&#13;
modified in 2003 (and hence began in 2004). Hence, the effect of decentralization on&#13;
importers (exporters) versus non-importers (non-exporters) nests the period of the VAT&#13;
&amp;#12;policy as well. Hence, we cannot separate the effect of the decentralization completely&#13;
from the VAT policy.&#13;
&#13;
To provide suggestive evidence that the VAT policy was more effective after&#13;
decentralization took place in cities we run DID specifications similar to (1) but restrict it&#13;
to the period before decentralization in regions. Note that different regions issued city&#13;
proclamations in different years ranging from 2004 to 2011. Hence each region and all&#13;
cities within the region had periods in time before decentralization in which the VAT had&#13;
already been introduced. If the VAT policy had an effect on different kinds of firms even&#13;
in the absence of the decentralization, we would not be able to conclude that the&#13;
decentralization at the city level had any additional impact on firms after the introduction&#13;
of VAT in 2003. Therefore, we test for the differential effect of the VAT introduction on&#13;
different kinds of firms before the decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Results&#13;
In this section, we describe our main results. First, we look at the results from the triple&#13;
difference specification (DIDID). In Table 3, we look at the effect of the decentralization&#13;
separately for importers and exporters. In all the regressions we include firm and year fixed&#13;
effects. Hence, we compare within-firm performance before and after the decentralization&#13;
that happened at different points in time for importers versus non-importers and for&#13;
exporters versus non-exporters. Firm fixed effects allow us to control for time invariant&#13;
firm-level unobservable characteristics such as managerial capacity, relationship with&#13;
government authorities etc. We also control for year fixed effects and this allows us to&#13;
control for any macroeconomic shocks affecting Ethiopia. In all the regressions we cluster&#13;
the standard errors at the city level. In Column 1, we find that importers performed better&#13;
than non-importers in cities after the decentralization, as compared to before the&#13;
decentralization. The magnitude of the treatment effect translates to an increase of 11.3%&#13;
in employment at the firm level. We do not find any statistically significant difference in&#13;
outcomes for importers as opposed to non-importers in terms of value of sales (Column 2).&#13;
Next, we look at the effect of the decentralization on exporters versus non-exporters and&#13;
we do not find any statistically significant difference in outcomes (employment or sales).&#13;
&#13;
Since a large part of the decentralization period coincides with the introduction of the VAT&#13;
in Ethiopia, it is plausible that these differential effects on importers and exporters might&#13;
be driven by the VAT policy. The VAT was introduced throughout Ethiopia in 2003. To&#13;
check whether the VAT policy change differentially affected importers (exporters) as&#13;
compared to non-importers (exporters), we run a difference in difference specification. We&#13;
compare importers to non-importers, and exporters to non-exporters before and after the&#13;
introduction of the VAT. These results are shown in Table 4. Column 1 and 2 show that&#13;
the VAT reform differentially impacted importers as compared to non-importers, both with&#13;
respect to employment and sales. In Columns 3 and 4, we look at the effect of the VAT&#13;
policy for exporters and non-exporters, and find no statistically significant difference in&#13;
outcomes. Hence, taken together, Tables 2 and 3 suggest that there was a differential effect&#13;
on importers compared to non-importers, and no such effect for exporters.&#13;

We hypothesize that the effect of the VAT was more pronounced for importing firms in&#13;
cities that had more powers post-decentralization as opposed to those in cities where&#13;
decentralization had not taken place. To answer this we need to test whether the differential&#13;
effect of VAT on importing firm increases or decreases, if we look only at cities and time&#13;
periods when the decentralization did not take place. Hence, we are essentially analyzing&#13;
&amp;#12;the effects of the VAT policy change on firms before the decentralization took place in&#13;
cities. If the VAT policy were driving the results, we would expect to see similar results&#13;
on the coefficient of the interaction terms VAT Ã&#151; Importer and VAT Ã&#151; Exporter as in Table&#13;
4. In Table 5, Columns 1 through 4, we do not find any statistically significant differences&#13;
in the outcomes of importing or exporting firms before and after the VAT policy.&#13;

&#13;
Hence, the results of Tables 3, 4 and 5 taken together seems to provide suggestive evidence&#13;
that the VAT policy led to differential outcomes on importing firms as compared to non-&#13;
importing firms. Furthermore, these results were more pronounced in decentralized cities&#13;
than in cities that had not gained more powers (not decentralized). These results seem to&#13;
suggest that city-level powers are important determinants of how firms respond to tax&#13;
incentives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Evidence of improvement in spatial equality&#13;
We also provide additional evidence that an increase in city-level powers leads to better&#13;
outcomes for worse-performing cities â&#128;&#147; in other words, leading to better spatial equity&#13;
across Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
Two separate issues are analyzed:&#13;
  1. Whether the city proclamations (decentralization) led to convergence in outcomes&#13;
      of cities within regions, and&#13;
  2. Whether the proclamations led to convergence in firm level outcomes within cities.&#13;
&amp;#12;If cities are provided with additional powers, convergence (or better spatial equity) would&#13;
suggest that initially worse-performing cities out-perform initially better-performing cities&#13;
â&#128;&#147; in effect, catching up with their better-performing counterparts. Divergence would&#13;
indicate the opposite leading to worsening spatial inequality within the region post-&#13;
decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
Since different regions introduced the city proclamations in different years, we test the first&#13;
hypothesis, using a difference-in-differences approach. We compare the difference in the&#13;
standard deviation of outcomes (employment, sales, value of production, and number of&#13;
firms) across cities (within a region) in decentralized regions as compared to non-&#13;
decentralized regions, before and after decentralization (city proclamation). Table 6&#13;
illustrates these results.&#13;

&#13;
We find that within regions, variance across cities has gone down post-decentralization as&#13;
compared to before decentralization in decentralized regions relative to non-decentralized&#13;
regions. This is suggestive evidence for convergence of city level outcomes post-&#13;
decentralization. This seems to imply that on average, cities have used their powers post-&#13;
decentralization to improve economic outcomes and that initially worse-off cities are&#13;
catching up with initially better-performing cities.&#13;
&#13;
This leads us to our second hypothesis â&#128;&#147; whether greater powers for cities after the&#13;
decentralization has meant abuse of powers by the city governments â&#128;&#147; in terms of favoring&#13;
some firms over others. If this were the case we would expect to find divergence in&#13;
outcomes at the firm level within cities. If cities had used their powers appropriately, we&#13;
&amp;#12;would expect to find convergence in the outcomes across firms within a city. We test this&#13;
hypothesis using a similar strategy as above. Table 7 illustrates these results.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The results in Table 2 above show that there is no statistically significant difference&#13;
between the variance of outcomes across firms within cities before and after&#13;
decentralization. This implies that the city proclamations did not lead to cities using their&#13;
powers to favor certain firms over others.&#13;
&#13;
The two sets of results from Tables 6 and 7 taken together provide additional evidence that&#13;
the process of decentralization in Ethiopia led to better city level outcomes and did not&#13;
results in improper abuse of powers by city governments in terms of favoring some firms&#13;
over others.&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
With the growth in urbanization over the last few decades, cities and city governments have&#13;
assumed a unique role in economic development. As countries around the world transform&#13;
structurally from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing or service-led economy, cities,&#13;
especially in developing countries, become a focal point of growth. In this paper, we&#13;
hypothesize that greater autonomy to cities in Ethiopia through a process of city&#13;
proclamations, led to better economic outcomes at the city level. Initially worse-performing&#13;
cities caught up with the better-performing counterparts in their region after&#13;
decentralization, leading to lower spatial inequality. This was not accompanied by&#13;
divergence in firm-level outcomes within the city, suggesting that the new powers were&#13;
not misused to favour particular firms. Indeed, national-level reforms were better&#13;
transmitted to the intended recipients post-decentralization. Following a nation-wide&#13;
introduction of VAT in Ethiopia, importing firms performed better (in terms of&#13;
&amp;#12;employment and sales) than non-importing firms. Importantly, importing firms performed&#13;
better after the VAT introduction in decentralized cities with greater autonomy than in non-&#13;
decentralized cities. This suggests that city governments (or the mayorâ&#128;&#153;s wedge) can play&#13;
a large role in making their cities more competitive through helping the growth of both&#13;
incumbent and new firms. The precise channels through which city governments can&#13;
influence firm growth are an exciting avenue for future research.&#13;
