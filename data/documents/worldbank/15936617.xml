&amp;#12;                                                                  24&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Now I would like to go over to a    pl~asant   subject and&#13;
tell you a little bit about the trip I have just had.          I just&#13;
&#13;
got back day before yesterday, and I might just tell you some&#13;
&#13;
of the things I did in each one of these countries, which will&#13;
give you an idea of what happened.&#13;
&#13;
         I went to Japan, and this is   my   first visit there.   I&#13;
&#13;
was accompanied by Mr. Rosen, the Director of the new Far&#13;
&#13;
Eastern Division, and Mr. Quandt, to whom we have assigned&#13;
&#13;
Japan.     Before I got there, Mr. DeWilde and Mr. Tolley had&#13;
&#13;
spent six weeks making an up-to-date economic study of the&#13;
country, which was presented to me by the time that I got&#13;
&#13;
there.     We were very fortunate in ha ving Mr. \'latanabe there&#13;
&#13;
at the same time.     He was very helpful in our discussions with&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   25&#13;
the government, and he was also very helpful in translat:tng&#13;
for me about twelve speeches that I had to make.        I think I&#13;
might give you my daily schedule.&#13;
&#13;
         We arrived there around the middle of the day, and I&#13;
&#13;
don't th.ink I ha ve ever seen as many photographers hit me at&#13;
one place as I did when I arrived in Tokyo.       The Japanese are&#13;
&#13;
very efficient in making cameras, and an awful lot of them&#13;
were in the hands of photographers there.       Mr. Adlai&#13;
&#13;
stevenson when he visited Japan said he didn't think Japan&#13;
should be called a democracy.       He thought it ought to be&#13;
&#13;
called a "photocracy."      That was what I ran into.    I had a&#13;
press conference right at the airport.       It was very interestin â&#128;¢ 
&#13;
&#13;
I then called on the Prime Minister, who as you know is&#13;
now taking a trip allover Southeast Asia and plans to come&#13;
to Washington next month.       Then later on the Prime Minister&#13;
gave a cocktail party in my honor, and that night the Minister&#13;
&#13;
of Finance    ~ve   a dinner.   The next day I called on the&#13;
Minister of Finance, then later on the Governor of the Bank of&#13;
&#13;
Japan.     Then in the afternoon I called on the Minister of&#13;
International Trade.      And I won't mention the luncheons and&#13;
dinners that took place every day, except to say they were&#13;
very pleasant and wonderful food, and the Japanese people are&#13;
justly famous for their marvelous hospitality.&#13;
         The second day I was there, just after I called on&#13;
&#13;
the Governor of the Bank of Japan, about one hour after I&#13;
&amp;#12;called on him, they raised the bank rate.     This was the second&#13;
&#13;
time that they had raised the bank rate, and the next day the&#13;
&#13;
stock market took a nosedive, but fortunately I wasn't&#13;
accused of having any hand in that.     It just happened after&#13;
&#13;
about an hour after I called on the Governor of the Bank of&#13;
&#13;
Japan.&#13;
         The following day I had an interest ing meeting with&#13;
&#13;
the representatives of the banks of Tokyo, and then I called&#13;
&#13;
on the Governor of the Japanese Development Bank.     As you&#13;
&#13;
know, that is the bank that we have channeled our loans in&#13;
&#13;
Japan through.&#13;
         The following day there was a conference with the&#13;
&#13;
leading business people in Tokyo, and then we left for&#13;
&#13;
Kyoto and did a little sightseeing there in the surrounding&#13;
&#13;
country for a couple of days.     Then we had a conference with&#13;
&#13;
the business leaders in the district and went to see the&#13;
&#13;
Mitsubishi shipyard at Kobe, which was quite an interesting&#13;
sight, because as you know the shipyards in Japan are loaded&#13;
&#13;
up for three or four years of business.&#13;
         The following day I had the pleasure of meeting the&#13;
&#13;
Emperor and the Empress, and then in the afternoon I visited&#13;
the factory of the Kalisaki Steel Corporation, which is one&#13;
&#13;
of the pro jects that we ha ve handled in Japan.,&#13;
         The next day I had my final meeting with the Minister&#13;
&#13;
of Finance and another press conference, and a meeting in the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              27&#13;
afternoon with the Minister of Construction, and another&#13;
meeting with all the foreign bankers who have offices there.&#13;
      The following day I had a meeting with the heads of&#13;
the largest security company.     Then we went to see the Tokyo&#13;
stock exchange and went to see the International Trade Fair&#13;
and called on the Governor of the Bank of Japan and a few&#13;
other people and then left Japan.&#13;
      It was a verY interesting trip.    We have made loans&#13;
totaling $77 million in Japan, and we expect to bring to&#13;
the Board shortly another loan for an irrigation project of&#13;
about $10 million.&#13;
      We were approached by the Japanese Government as to the&#13;
possibility of the Bank extending more loans to Japan or&#13;
increasing the amount that we had in mind when we first&#13;
started dOing business there.     I informed the Government that&#13;
we would be willing to recommend additional loans over and&#13;
above the limit that we had originally set, and we expect to&#13;
have a project submitted to us covering the bottlenecks in&#13;
Japan, which were transportation, power, and industrial&#13;
expansion of particularly steel.     They have done a verY good&#13;
job in that countrY.   There has been a little slowdown lately,&#13;
or rather a reduction in the reserves of about $250 million&#13;
since the first of the year.    The investments have been going&#13;
pretty fast, and that was the principal reason for the second&#13;
increase in the bank rate.     I was impressed by the fact that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                28&#13;
most people I talked to in Japan were very keen that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
not only lend money to Japan but that the Bank also increase&#13;
its activity in Asia.    I ran into that everywhere that I went.&#13;
&#13;
They thought it was very important, and they would like to see&#13;
the Bank be even more active in that area of the world.        It&#13;
&#13;
was suggested to us that the Bank might open up a regional&#13;
office, and that we might open up this regional office in&#13;
&#13;
Japan.    I discouraged that, saying that we didn.t like to have&#13;
regional offices where we didn.t think it would make any&#13;
&#13;
difference.    It certainly wouldn't increase the amount of the&#13;
loans that we made if we had a regional office.        But this was&#13;
part of the picture of their very keen interest in that part&#13;
of the world in getting a substantial share of the Bankts&#13;
loans.&#13;
         I was very favorably impressed with the progress in the&#13;
&#13;
country, with the skill and the energy and the resourcefulness.&#13;
When I say "energy, n that means the hard work, and the&#13;
&#13;
resourcefulness and the managerial ability of the Japanese&#13;
people.     Of course they have problems, as everybody else has,&#13;
&#13;
but you can.t help but be impressed with the job that they&#13;
have done and are doing today.     I was also greatly impressed&#13;
with the literacy.     It is about 99 percent there.     It was a&#13;
very profitable trip.&#13;
