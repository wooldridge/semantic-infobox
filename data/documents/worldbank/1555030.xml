THE EFFECTS OF EDUCATION ON HEALTH&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1980&#13;
This paper investigates, from three overlapping perspectives, the effects of&#13;
education on health. The determinants of mortality are receiving increasing&#13;
scrutiny because the rate of mortality reduction in the developing world appears&#13;
to have slowed at levels of life expectancy below those thought attainable only&#13;
a few years ago. The first perspective employed in this paper is a broad&#13;
assessment of the socioeconomic determinants of mortality on a cross-national&#13;
basis; using aggregate data, this paper contains a review and a reanalysis of&#13;
the large body of literature that has accumulated on international differences&#13;
in mortality and life expectancy. The second perspective sharpens the focus by&#13;
concentrating on the relationship between education and mortality since the&#13;
cross-national evidence suggests that education, or its proxy literacy, is&#13;
the most important variable involved. A theoretical model of the relationship&#13;
between parental education and child health is developed and used to describe&#13;
how aggregate and individual data may give different estimates of the relationship.&#13;
The third perspective employed reviews and reanalyzes the evidence at the&#13;
subnational level. Individual evidence is reviewed on the relationship between&#13;
parental education and both child nutrition and child mortality. This evidence&#13;
is then compared with aggregate data to test the implications of the model.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. Purpose of the Paper&#13;
This paper investigates, from three overlapping perspectives,&#13;
the effects of education on health. The quality of life in the developing world&#13;
rests ultimately on the basic facts of mortality rates and the human potential&#13;
preserved or actualized by their reduction. Yet the rate of mortality reduction&#13;
in the countries of the developing world appears to have slowed at levels of life&#13;
expectancy below those thought attainable only a few years ago. In the attempt&#13;
to identify the causes of this slowdown, the determinants of mortality are&#13;
receiving increased scrutiny.&#13;
The first perspective employed in this paper is, therefore, a broad&#13;
one: that of an assessment of socioeconomic determinants of mortality on a&#13;
crossnational basis. It presents a review of, and, where appropriate, a&#13;
reanalysis to acquire new insights into, the findings of a large body of liter-&#13;
ature that has accumulated on the determinates of mortality, using data on&#13;
national differences in mortality, socioeconomic development and, where possible,&#13;
provision of medical services.&#13;
The second perspective employed is to sharpen the focus of the study by&#13;
concentrating on one aspect of the relationship between education and mortality,&#13;
since the cross-national evidence suggests that education, or its proxy, literacy,&#13;
seems to be the most important variable involved. A theoretical model of the&#13;
relationship between parental education and child health is developed and used&#13;
to describe how aggregate and individual data may give different estimates of&#13;
the relationship.&#13;
The third perspective employed in the study, emerging from the&#13;
second, is one that further sharpens the focus by concentrating on a review of&#13;
evidence at the individual level, specifically, intracountry evidence on parental&#13;
education and its association with child health.&#13;
In sum: national and equally substantial individual evidence, taken&#13;
together, help elucidate the significance of the effects of parental education&#13;
on child health; this association, as clarified by careful and detailed analysis&#13;
employing standard statistical techniques, is of no small concern to the theory&#13;
and practice of poverty-reducing development in the 1980s and beyond.&#13;
B. Organization of the Paper&#13;
Reflecting the three perspectives mentioned above, the remainder of&#13;
the paper is divided into three chapters. The first of these, Chapter II,&#13;
investigates the socioeconomic determinants of mortality, using cross-national&#13;
evidence. After a brief introduction, Chapter II is made up of five main&#13;
sections and a brief conclusion. The first section introduces and assesses&#13;
the use of cross-national regression and correlation analysis. Following this&#13;
review of aggregate data the analysis moves on to an assessment of the cross-&#13;
national evidence regarding life expectancy and per capita income. The next&#13;
section offers a comparative analysis of the relation between income and life&#13;
expectancy through a reanalysis of the data from earlier findings. The fourth&#13;
section reviews the evidence associating income distribution , life expectancy,&#13;
and mortality, using bivariate and multivariate analysis and summarizing various&#13;
findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Chapter III presents an attempt at modeling the effect of education&#13;
on health. It first reviews the general relationship of education and health,&#13;
then assesses broad aspects of the effects of the former on the latter. It next&#13;
addresses the pertinent questions: "Whose education? Whose health?" concluding&#13;
that the clearest analysis is possible for parental education and child health.&#13;
A model of household production of health is then presented. Familiar supply&#13;
and demand concepts are then used to facilitate interpretation, and special&#13;
cases are then analyzed. The effects on the model of incorporating other&#13;
determinants of health are then addressed, as are the challenges presented by&#13;
omitted exogenous variables in four types of sample. The problem of the inclusion&#13;
of "inappropriate" variables is then addressed, and the chapter concludes by&#13;
assessing the simultaneous determination of education and health for the popu-&#13;
lation as a whole.&#13;
Chapter IV, in reviewing the intracountry evidence relating parental&#13;
education and child health, offers an overall introduction and then analyzes&#13;
parental education and the nutritional status of children; the microlevel data&#13;
on parental education and child mortality, including a multivariate analysis of&#13;
the effect of education; and an analysis of aggregation that includes both&#13;
intracountry aggregate multivariate determinants of child mortality and the&#13;
effect of aggregate characteristics on the individual education-child mortality&#13;
relationship. Chapter IV ends with a concluding review which sets the results of&#13;
the analysis within the broader framework of the paper.&#13;
Because of the specific focus of each of the three main chapters,&#13;
separate references .to the literature surveyed and analyzed, and to other relevant&#13;
studies, will be found at the end of each of the chapters. Tabular presentations&#13;
are used throughout as a means to summarizing the main-findings of the various&#13;
statistical analyses used in the paper.&#13;

II. THE SOCIOECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF MORTALITY:&#13;
THE CROSS NATIONAL EVIDENCE&#13;
Susan H. Cochrane*&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
The rate of reduction of mortality in the countries of the&#13;
developing world seems to have slowed at levels of life expectancy below what&#13;
was thought achievable only a few years ago (Gwatkins, 1979).** To identify the&#13;
causes of this slowdown, the determinants of mortality are being studied with&#13;
renewed interest. The major question appears to be the extent to which such&#13;
reductions have been, and will continue to be, limited by income and living&#13;
standards and to what extent by medical technology and health delivery systems.&#13;
Samuel Preston and Robert Gardner have stated that: "given motiva-&#13;
tion, the level of mortality in a population must be a product of two fac-&#13;
tors: the level of knowledge regarding ways to combat diseases, and the&#13;
means available for implementing that knowledge. These factors operate at&#13;
both the individual and the societal level." (Preston and Gardner, 1976,&#13;
p. 2.) But they go on to state that, given the externalities involved in&#13;
mortality transmission, at an aggregate level one must also add as a factor the&#13;
"ability of a group to organize available resources to achieve commonly valued&#13;
goals. "&#13;
Much of the debate about past and potential reductions in mortality&#13;
can be placed within this framework. A large body of literature&#13;
has accumulated on the determinants of mortality on the national level using&#13;
aggregate data; the major conclusions of this work will now be reviewed, and,&#13;
whenever possible, the data will be reanalyzed to provide new insights.&#13;
B. The Aggregate Analysis&#13;
Two types of analysis have been used to explain the relative importance&#13;
of economic resources and medical technology in determining mortality levels and&#13;
changes at the aggregate level. The method most familiar to economists is&#13;
bivariate or multivariate regression analysis. A second technique, used by&#13;
demographers, is the analysis of changes in cause of death combined with inform-&#13;
ation about how such diseases have been brought under control. In this chapter&#13;
we shall concentrate on cross-national regression and correlation analysis.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Before reviewing the cross-national studies of the determinants of&#13;
mortality it is necessary to give two warnings. First, there is very little&#13;
specific theory on the socioeconomic determinants of mortality, as opposed to&#13;
biological theories about causes of death. Second, the data on life expectancy&#13;
or age-adjusted mortality are not routinely generated by vital registration&#13;
systems in developing countries. Much of the analysis of cross-national&#13;
data is therefore restricted to countries which are atypical of the world as a&#13;
whole, particularly for earlier points in time. In reviewing such studies,&#13;
it is thus necessary to pay close attention to the countries included in the&#13;
sample, to determine if sample bias affects the results.&#13;
The lack of theory pertaining to the socioeconomic determinants&#13;
of mortality manifests itself in the literature by a lack of agreement on&#13;
what variables should be included in the analysis, and what mathematical&#13;
specification should be used in empirical estimation. Per capita income is&#13;
the most widely discussed socioeconomic determinant of mortality, primarily&#13;
because it is considered a summary of the ability of an economy to meet the&#13;
needs of its citizens. We shall accordingly begin our analysis by examining&#13;
those bivariate studies which examine the relationship between a country's&#13;
life expectancy or mortality and per capita income.&#13;
The questions that have been raised at the policy level about the&#13;
relationship between mortality or life expectancy and income are often&#13;
fairly cloudy and difficult to test empirically. Most of the concern seems&#13;
to center around whether it is possible to achieve further reductions in&#13;
mortality in the developing countries through "cheap" health interventions,&#13;
or whether mortality can only be reduced by increasing standards of living.&#13;
Earlier analysis of the British experience in the 19th century (McKeown,&#13;
Brown and Record, 1972) and the Latin American experience prior to the&#13;
1930s (Arriaga and Davis, 1965) showed that mortality decline was closely&#13;
related to improvements in living standards rather than medical breakthroughs.&#13;
From the 1930s to the 1960s, however, it was claimed mortality reduction&#13;
were largely independent of increases in living standards (Arriaga and&#13;
Davis, 1965). The new concern 'centers around the issue of whether we are&#13;
in fact entering an age when medical technology can do little to reduce&#13;
mortality if living standards do not improve.' Much of the analysis to&#13;
date, although quite valuable, has however been based on rather impression-&#13;
istic discussions of changes in mortality from specific causes. Further,&#13;
the data base is inadequate in many areas and in any event there is a lack&#13;
of vigorous methodology. This is not to imply that mortality reductions&#13;
can in fact continue without improvements in living standards, but rather&#13;
that we do not as yet know enough about the relationship between living&#13;
standards and mortality to make firm statements. To learn more, we need to&#13;
phrase our questions in an empirically verifiable form.&#13;
Using aggregate data we can ask about the relationship between&#13;
mortality and income in two basic ways. First, we can ask how closely&#13;
have income and mortality been related in various periods, and whether this&#13;
has changed over time. This initial question can itself be rephrased in two&#13;
ways: (1) At any point in time how much of the variation in mortality or&#13;
life expectancy is "explained" by variations in per capita income, and has&#13;
the proportion of variation changed over time? (This is a question of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
goodness-of-fit.) (2) At any point in time how much of an increase in&#13;
life-expectancy is associated with a given increase in income, and has this&#13;
changed over time? (This is a question of the slope or elasticity of life&#13;
expectancy with respect to income.) These two formulations of the first&#13;
question are often confused.&#13;
The second question is: How much of the change over time in&#13;
mortality or life expectancy is related to income? "Related to income" is&#13;
generally interpreted to mean "related to changes in income," but it is&#13;
possible that levels of income in one period might be responsible for&#13;
changes in mortality over a subsequent period. Some formulations of the&#13;
question on the relationship between income and mortality seem to ask&#13;
whether this dynamic relationship has changed over time.&#13;
While the theory of the relationship between income and mortality&#13;
at any point in time is underdeveloped, the theory of how that relationship&#13;
shifts over time is unfortunately nonexistent. In the following review&#13;
we shall therefore simply analyze the existing empirical studies to determine&#13;
what insights they give on these questions, and then reanalyze some of the&#13;
data to elucidate fresh insights.&#13;
C. Life Expectancy and Per Capita Income: The Evidence&#13;
The specification of the functions to be reviewed here varies widely.&#13;
The only consensus is that: (1) income is positively related to life&#13;
expectancy (i.e. negatively related to mortality); and (2) there is an&#13;
upper limit on life expectancy (or a lower limit on mortality) above which&#13;
(below which) increases in income will have no effect. 1/ Beyond these&#13;
basic restrictions, there has been considerable variation in the functional&#13;
relationship assumed in the studies reviewed.&#13;
Samuel Preston has contributed a number of studies which attempt&#13;
to evaluate the relative importance of income and changes in income in&#13;
determining the levels and changes in the level of mortality. His basic&#13;
conclusion (which will be amplified and qualified below) is that at any point&#13;
in time life expectancy and income per capita are very closely related, but&#13;
that over time changes in income have been rather unimportant since World&#13;
War II in determining changes in life expectancy. 2/   His&#13;
initial regressions use a modified logarithmic relation between income and&#13;
life expectancy for 38 countries in the early 1930s and 57 countries around&#13;
1/   While Malthus initiated the analysis of the effect of economic variables&#13;
on mortality in his discussion of subsistence income, none of the studies&#13;
reviewed attempted to identify such a concept empirically.&#13;
2/   For the 1930s a simple correlation was 0.885 (38 countries, 14 of them&#13;
developing countries). For 57 countries (25 of them developing countries)&#13;
in the 1960s he found 0.880 (Preston, 1975 p. 235). In another study he&#13;
found simple correlations for 120 countries around 1970 of 0.859 for&#13;
the natural log of income and 0.693 for income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
1963. 1/ He concludes that life expectancy has not become progressively dis-&#13;
associated from income over time, at least between the 1930s and the 1960s as&#13;
measured by these correlations.&#13;
This tight relationship between income and life expectancy, however,&#13;
has shown very substantial shifts over time, so that in the 1960s much lower&#13;
levels of income were necessary to achieve the same life expectancies as in the&#13;
1930s, particularly between the life expectancies of 40 and 60 years. 2/ While&#13;
some of this difference may be due to the different samples involved, it seems&#13;
unlikely that the full extent of the change was so explained. A large portion&#13;
of the increase in life expectancy over that period must, therefore, have been&#13;
due to sources other than income growth.&#13;
Preston estimates the relative role of income in increasing life&#13;
expectancies using two techniques. The first uses regional data for the&#13;
1930s and the 1960s and the static equations estimated above, by estimating&#13;
the 1960s life expectancy using the 1930s equation and 1960s income, and&#13;
then using 1930s income in the 1960s equation. The resulting estimates can&#13;
be compared to the actual change in life expectancy over the period. This&#13;
procedure gives two estimates of the magnitude of the shift due to income.&#13;
Of a total increase in life expectancy of 12.2 years, income accounted for&#13;
2.5 or 1.3 years depending on which measure of shift was utilized. Thus&#13;
income accounts for between 20.5 and 10.7 percent, respectively. Averaging&#13;
these figures, Preston obtains a result of 16 percent.&#13;
1J   Preston found that a simple logarithmic relationship consistently&#13;
overestimated life expectancy at the lower income levels. Therefore&#13;
a modified formulation was used.&#13;
For: 1930s: e° - 80/[(lexp -1.6251+2.0768 (.9317)Y'1&#13;
1960s: e6 - 80/[l+exp -2.1354+2.1697 (0.7627)Y'] where 80 represents&#13;
a reassigned asymptote.&#13;
3J   While it took less income to achieve any level of life expectancy in&#13;
the 1960s than in the 1930s, at many points the slope of the 1960s curve&#13;
is less than the slope of the curve for the 1930s. This, rather than&#13;
the goodness-of-fit criterion, seems to be the definition of the disas-&#13;
sociation of the relationship implied by some writers on the subject.&#13;
See "Background Paper on Health" from the Bellagio Conference on Health&#13;
and Population in Developing Countries, April 1979, pp. 33-34.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
The secoild technique used by Preston involves estimating an equation&#13;
of the change in life expectancy between the early 1930s and the early 1960s&#13;
for those c_intries for which data are available in both periods. The inde-&#13;
pendent variables in this equation were the 1930s level of income, the absolute&#13;
change in income between the 1930s and the 1960s and a ratio of 1960s income to&#13;
that of the 1930s. 1/ This regression equation has an R2 of .441; only the 1930s&#13;
level of income is significant. According to this equation, if no income growth&#13;
had occurred, then life expectancy would have been slowed by only 1.07 years or&#13;
7 percent of actual mean growth. Of the two figures (7 and 16 percent) attri-&#13;
butable to income growth over the period, Preston feels that 16 percent is a&#13;
better estimate given the measurement problems in the second equation (and, one&#13;
might add, the rather ad hoc specification of the longitudinal analysis).&#13;
This pattern of close relationships between per capita income and&#13;
life expectancy at two points in time with large shifts in the relationship&#13;
between the periods leaves two questions unanswered. The first is: What&#13;
factors caused the shift? The second is: Have these factors been behaving&#13;
in such a way that the shifts were similar between the 1960s and the 1970s?&#13;
The second question is perhaps easier to address than the first.&#13;
Gwatkins has explained the slowdown in mortality reduction since the 1960s by&#13;
shifts in the relative importance of various kinds of disease. Once those&#13;
diseases easily conquerable by vaccination and simple health measures were&#13;
eliminated, mortality associated with living standards, such as gastro-intestinal&#13;
diseases, became relatively more important. Mortality reduction since the&#13;
1960s should therefore be more closely tied to changes in living standards&#13;
than previously. 2/ Gwatkins does not, however go on to simply identify&#13;
improved living standards with income, but noted the slowdown in food production&#13;
per capita and education as being crucial. These issues will be examined&#13;
later in our review.&#13;
To examine how the interrelationship between income and life&#13;
expectancy has shifted since the 1960s, it is possible to use the analysis&#13;
reported by Dyson, Bell and Cassen with data from 146 countries (over 90 of&#13;
them developing) for the period around 1970, and that undertaken by Isenman&#13;
for 59 countries around 1975. 3/&#13;
Dyson et al. used a slightly different specification than did Preston:&#13;
e =    AO&#13;
1 + c exp [-b (Y-Y*)]&#13;
1/   The probable reason for selecting this formulation, rather than making&#13;
changes in life expectancy simply a function of changes in income, will&#13;
become apparent later.&#13;

reasonable with an asymptote of 71 years. 31&#13;
Isenuan (1979) used a simpler specification of the relationship&#13;
than did Preston, but this specification has the advantage of being easier to&#13;
interpret.&#13;
The estinted regression found by Isenamn was:&#13;

Income has the expected sign and is statistically significant.&#13;
The results reported by Dyson et al. are difficult to compare with&#13;
those of Isenman (and those of Preston for earlier periods) because of&#13;
differences in equation specifications, different samples 2nd differences in&#13;
the data reported: Preston, for example, did not report R or t values. In&#13;
addition, the different estimates were not made with constant prices.&#13;
1/ Preston specified his asymptote as 80.&#13;
2/ Preston's formulation lacks an inflection point. See note 1 to page&#13;
6 for Preston's specification.&#13;
3/ The negative coefficient here is rather confusing given the equation&#13;
specification. If the minus precedes b in the equation, then the esti-&#13;
mated value should be positive; undoubtedly this is a misprint.&#13;

D. Comparative Analysis of the Relation Between Income and Life Expectancy:&#13;
A Reanalysis of the Data&#13;
We shall attempt to overcome the difficulties just mentioned by&#13;
reanalzing the data sets used by Preston for 1930, 1940, 1963 and Dyson et al.&#13;
for 1970. Unfortunately, Isenman does not give a listing of the countries&#13;
included in his 1975 data set. It is, however, considerably smaller than the&#13;
Dyson data set, perhaps because it is restricted to developing countries .&#13;
Isenman's equation specification will be used as a basis for comparison. While&#13;
the more complex specifications of Preston and Dyson et al. might be preferred&#13;
on theoretical grounds, they are difficult to estimate and interpret. For our&#13;
reanalysis, therefore, we shall use the simpler double log formulation used by&#13;
Isenman. The fit is almost as good and the coefficient of the log of income can&#13;
be interpreted directly as an elasticity. Table 2-1 summarizes the results for&#13;
the different periods with various samples. All income measures were converted&#13;
to 1970 dollars for comparability.&#13;
Examining Part A of the table we see that between the 1930s and&#13;
1940s and the 1960s and 1970s the amount of yariation in life expectancy&#13;
explained by income levels (as measured by R ) seems to have fallen. This&#13;
is in part illusionary, however, because a far greater variety of countries&#13;
is represented in the later than the earlier samples. We can control this&#13;
by using the same samples aYd updated data as set out in parts B and C of&#13;
the table. The change in R apparent in Part A is not apparent when the&#13;
1930 or 1963 samples are used with 1963 and 1970 data. We can thus generalize&#13;
Preston's statement and say that between the 1930s and the 1970s there had&#13;
not been any progressive disassociation between income and life expectancy.&#13;
We might add there has certainly been no increasing association between the&#13;
variables in this sense (although this might not be the most important&#13;
aspect of the relationship).&#13;
Contrary to the theory that income has become more important,&#13;
there appears to have been a very substantial reduction in the elasticity&#13;
of life expectancy with respect to income as measured by b. This reduction&#13;
is even greater when constant samples are used. Part A in Table 2-1&#13;
indicates that the elasticities have declined from over .2 in the 1930s and&#13;
1940s to less than .16 in the 1960s and 1970s, and the reduction is even&#13;
greater when constant samples are used. It should be recalled that income&#13;
has been measured in constant dollars, so this finding is not the result of&#13;
inflation. 1/ This basically means that in the more recent periods a given&#13;
1/ Isenman's sample indicates a similar reduction in b, but much larger&#13;
(to .123). At least part of this result must arise from the fact that&#13;
his income measure is in 1975 dollars.&#13;

percentage increase in life expectancy came to be associated with a substan-&#13;
tially larger percentage increases in income. This could be interpreted&#13;
as a manifestation of diminishing returns. While this finding is disturbing,&#13;
it should be noted that, over time, the constant has been increasing substan-&#13;
tially. This increase in the constant is even greater in the restricted&#13;
samples so is not a function of sample bias, but of the very real increased&#13;
ability to achieve higher levels of life expectancy independently of income&#13;
levels. 1/&#13;
1/   There do appear to be minor fluctuations in the constant between 1963,&#13;
1970, and 1975, but these are small enough to perhaps be random.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

These two measures of the relationship between income and life&#13;
expectancy can give rise to conflicting interpretations if the questions&#13;
asked are not clearly stated. Properly interpreted, the results imply that&#13;
at specific points in time per capita income and life expectancy remain&#13;
closely related cross-nationally, but that in later years it takes larger&#13;
percentage increases in income to bring about increases in life expectancy.&#13;
It is uncertain why this is so , but it seems to be a manifestation over&#13;
time of the cross-sectional diminishing returns to per capita income. But&#13;
while this tells us a great deal, it does not answer the question of&#13;
whether increases in life expectancy over time (rather than at a fixed&#13;
point in time) are coming to be more dependent on increases in income, and&#13;
less on improvements in medical technology and public health programs.&#13;
To our knowledge, this dynamic specification of the question&#13;
has not been tested in the literature. Preston's attempt to estimate the&#13;
ability to explain life expectancy changes by income change in the 1930-63&#13;
period has been mentioned above. Later, we shall discuss his attempt to&#13;
explain changes in life expectancy between 1940 and 1970 on the basis of&#13;
changes in income literacy and caloric consumption. But no one has hitherto&#13;
compared the various periods in a systematic way. In Table 2-2, part A&#13;
reports on the results of such a very simple test of the double-log relationship&#13;
between changes in life expectancy and changes in income for various&#13;
periods.&#13;

Three points of qualification should be kept in mind in interpreting&#13;
Table 2-2. First, whenever changes over time are calculated they are of&#13;
necessity restricted to those data sets in which data are available at both&#13;
periods, and thus to the smaller data set which is usually the one in the&#13;
earlier time period. Our earlier analysis showed that this can introduce&#13;
some change in the results. Secondly, the length of the periods involved are&#13;
quite different. A-comparison of the role of income changes (or exogenous&#13;
factors) in mortality declines between 1930 and 1963 or even 1940 and 1963&#13;
and between mortality changes in 1963 and 1970 can be quite misleading unless&#13;
we recognize that technology had a much longer time to operate and that one&#13;
must not expect exogenous changes to be as great in a 7 year period as in a&#13;
33 ora 23 year period.   A third, and related, point would seem to be that the&#13;
shorter the time period, the less the change resulting from exogenous factors (a&#13;
function of random breakthough in medicine) and the more it is a function of the&#13;
implementation in a country of known technology, which is in itself a function&#13;
of its income level. With these caveats in mind we shall now examine the data&#13;
in Table 2-2.&#13;
The double logged relationship between changes in life expectancy&#13;
and changes in income are very startling. The change in life expectancy&#13;
is negatively related to changes in income, and in most cases these coeffi-&#13;
cients are significant. If, however, we add the initial level of income we&#13;
get a much clearer picture. It is not the change or increase in income per&#13;
se which is negatively related to life expectancy, but the initial level of&#13;
income. One finds that changes in income are positively related to changes&#13;
in life expectancy, but that the coefficients of income changes are not&#13;
significant.&#13;
Interpreting this result is not too difficult if one recalls both&#13;
the close relationship between income and life expectancy and the diminishing&#13;
returns to increases in income at higher levels of income on life expectancy.&#13;
One would therefore expect that it is the initially higher level of life&#13;
expectancy in high income countries that might cause this perverse result.&#13;
Given this information, it seems more appropriate to specify the relationship&#13;
in such a way as to include the initial level of life expectancy in the&#13;
equation explaining changes in life expectancy.&#13;
Table 2-3 shows that the initial level of life expectancy is a&#13;
very strong predictor of changes in life expectancy for all periods except&#13;
1930-40. In addition, when life expectancy is included with the change in&#13;
income and the initial level of income, the results for the two Short&#13;
periods 1930-40 and 1963-70 are poor with low adjusted R S , (R ), but&#13;
for the longer periods we find that changes in income have a positive,&#13;
significant coefficient. Initial income levels have insignificant coeffi-&#13;
cients that fluctuate in sign. Thus part of the poor performance of&#13;
earlier estimates of the dynamic relationship between income change and&#13;
life expectancy change result from the fact that diminishing returns were&#13;
not explicitly built into the model.&#13;
With this alternative specification we can now address the question&#13;
of whether changes in life expectancy have come to depend more on income&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
changes than previously. It appears, however, that this question should&#13;
not be addressed directly using the change over the 1963-70 period because&#13;
of the very poor performance of equations that explain change over other&#13;
short periods. We can, however, compare the 1930-63 equation and .he&#13;
1930-70 equations to see if the coeffici'ent on income change increases.&#13;
The same comparison can be made for the 1940-63 and 1940-70 equation.&#13;
These two sets of comparisons show that the income elasticity 1/ increased&#13;
for the latter period, as did the explanatory power of the equation.&#13;

As Table 2-3 indicates, the elasticity of income change increases&#13;
from .17 in 1930-63 to .23 in 19 20-70 and from .074 in the 1940-63 period&#13;
to .16 in the 1940-70 period. R increases from .57 to .67 between 1930-63&#13;
and 1930-70 and from .62 to .68 from 1940-70.&#13;
1/   This use of income elasticity should not be confused with the concept&#13;
in demand theory. In Tables 2-2 and 2-3 the income elasticity refers to&#13;
the elasticity of changes in life expectancy to changes in income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
One could stop at this point by stating that we have found that,&#13;
based on this evidence, changes in income have become more important in&#13;
explaining changes in life expectancy in the later periods than the earlier&#13;
periods. But there is another way of interpreting these results. It may&#13;
well be that thia finding is the result, not of the fact that the terminal&#13;
year or the periods covered differ in,a substantive way, but that the&#13;
periods differ in length and the periods with 1970 as the terminal year are&#13;
in fact longer periods. On a priori grounds one could argue that the&#13;
longer the period, the greater the potential for medical breakthroughs that&#13;
would reduce the importance of income changes in increasing income.&#13;
Alternatively, if changes in income are correlated with changes in other&#13;
measures which increase life expectancy, and if this correlation increases&#13;
over time, then the longer the period, the greater will be the apparent&#13;
effect of income change. 1/&#13;
If we examine the coefficient of income change by the length&#13;
of the period we find that the income elasticity is as follows:&#13;
Period          Length of Period      Income Elasticity      R2&#13;
(years)&#13;
1940-63                23                   .074 (1.74)       .62&#13;
1940-70                30                  .16  (2.36)        .57&#13;
1930-63                33                   .17  (2.36)       .68&#13;
1930-70                40                   .23  (3.58)       .67&#13;
Two interpretations thus exist of the results in Table 2-3.&#13;
Either changes in income have become more important over the period 1963-7Q,&#13;
or, alternatively, the longer the period the greater the association of income&#13;
changes with other determinants of changes in life expectancy changes.&#13;
In fact, we do not really know the extent to which income levels&#13;
and changes are in and of themselves important in determining mortality, and&#13;
to what extent they simply reflect the other variables with which they are&#13;
associated which determine life expectancy. Certainly no one contends&#13;
that the full unexplained shift in the relationship between income and life&#13;
expectancy is the result of changes in medical technology. But a better&#13;
understanding of the dynamic relationship should result from a closer study&#13;
of the static relationship.&#13;
1/   This appears to have been the case for the change in illiteracy and the&#13;
log of the change in income. This correlation increased from .1225 in&#13;
the 1940-63 period to .4971 in the 1940-70 period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
The first facet of the income-life expectancy relationship that&#13;
needs to be explained is the extent to which average income levels are&#13;
significant because they reflect the individual's level of income, and the&#13;
extent to which they are important independently of individual income.&#13;
(This could result from the fact that countries with higher average income&#13;
can provide better public health, sanitation, etc.) A number of studies&#13;
have indirectly approached this issue by examining the relationship between&#13;
the distribution of income, as well as its level, and life expectancy.&#13;
Unfortunately -- but due, no doubt, to the lack of data -- there have been&#13;
no studies which analyze changes in this relationship over time.&#13;
E. Income Distribution and Life Expectancy and Morality: The Evidence&#13;
The most obvious aspect of the relationship between per capita&#13;
income and life expectancy is its nonlinearity with the appearance of&#13;
diminishing returns. Diminishing returns (in terms of improved health) to&#13;
i-ircreased income seem quite plausible at the individual as well as the&#13;
aggregate level. If this is in fact the case, then the aggregate relationship&#13;
would depend not only on the average level of income in a country, but also&#13;
on its distribution.&#13;
In his 1976 NBER paper, Preston tested a specification of the&#13;
relationship betweent life expectancy and per capita income which included&#13;
a distribution term. 1/&#13;
0&#13;
e = a + b lnY + b.f .ln (S/iI   2/.&#13;
where     V    the mean level of income.&#13;
Si   share of total national income earned by group i.&#13;
f,= share of total population represented by group i (assumed to&#13;
be constant between groups.)&#13;
The term } ln Si/fiwould equal zero if income were equality dis-&#13;
tributed and - X if any group had no income.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
Using 20 income groups for 52 countries (37 of which were developing&#13;
countries) Preston obtained the following result for 1970:&#13;
0&#13;
e   - 19.105 + 6.984 ln Y + .373 z (S /.05)&#13;
o                                       i&#13;
(.859)       (.237)&#13;
R2  = .651 and -2   .644&#13;
The coefficient in the distribution term is not significant. In&#13;
part, this might result from errors of measurement in the distribution term.&#13;
Preston concludes, however, that the magnitude of the coefficient is such&#13;
as to lead to the conclusion that in fact this specification is correct,&#13;
and that individual, rather than average, incomes explain the income-life&#13;
expectancy relationship. 1/&#13;
Others have experimented with the specification of the income-&#13;
life expectancy relationship. The most recent of their studies is, that&#13;
by G. B. Rodgers (1979). Using data on 56 countries (the countries used&#13;
and the time periods were not specified) Rodgers experimented with three&#13;
alternative dependent variables: life expectancy at birth, life expectancy&#13;
at age 5 and infant mortality. He also used a number of different income&#13;
specifications, the reciprocal, reciprocal quadradic, and reciprocal&#13;
logarithm. Income distribution was measured in most cases by Gini coeffi-&#13;
cients, but in a couple of formulations he used instead the average income&#13;
of the lowest x percent of the population. It is somewhat difficult to&#13;
summarize the multitude of ad hoc equations. But in all specifications for&#13;
life expectancy at birth the Gini coefficient was negative and significant,&#13;
and income had the expected sign and was generally significant. This&#13;
finding tends to confirm that both the level of income and its distribution&#13;
are important. However, the simpler specification&#13;
of e  = a + b/Y  + C/Y  (where Y  is the average income level of the bottom&#13;
o           a      a           a&#13;
1/   Given the equation e0 = a4b ln Y + b.fi  Z ln S/fi and using fi  .05,&#13;
Preston concludes that if the coefficient on r ln S/fiequals .05&#13;
of the coefficient on b then only individual income matters, not the&#13;
aggregate average income; and if the coefficient is less than .05 then&#13;
aggregate income per se makes a contribution in addition to individual&#13;
income. The coefficient is in fact .0536 of the coefficient of ln Y,&#13;
but no statistical test was done to determine whether this is signifi-&#13;
cant.&#13;

"a" percent of the population) did equally as well when "a" ranged from 20&#13;
to 100 percent of the population and all coefficients were significant. 1/&#13;
This would imply that it is the entire distribution of income that matters&#13;
and not simply the income level of the lowest portion of the population.&#13;
The causal significance of this implication is unclear.&#13;
In the equation for life expectancy at fifth birthday, the Gini&#13;
coefficient was significant in one of the two formulations of the log specifi-&#13;
cation and in the combination with the simple reciprocal for income.&#13;
The equations for infant mortality had lower R2's overall than&#13;
did the equations using the other two dependent variables. The pattern of&#13;
significance for the Gini coefficients in these equations was the same as&#13;
in the equations for life expectancy at age 5. The t values for Gini&#13;
coefficients were in all cases lower in infant mortality and life expectancy&#13;
at age 5 than for life expectancy at birth.&#13;
It is unclear whether the somewhat poorer performance of infant&#13;
n rtality equations compared with life expectancy tables, (both in terms of&#13;
R and the significance of income distribution) results from larger measurement&#13;
errors in infant mortality, or from underlying differences in the determinants&#13;
of infant mortality. It is also unclear, as Rodgers has pointed out,&#13;
whether it is income inequality per se that is involved or the fact that&#13;
such inequality "is likely to be associated with inequality in access to&#13;
health and social services, in education and in a number of other aspects&#13;
of society relevant to mortality." (Rodgers, 1979, p. 350). As a next&#13;
step in examining the determinants of mortality, we shall now look at those&#13;
studies (first bivariate, and then multivariate) which include other&#13;
socioeconomic determinants of mortality or life expectancy.&#13;
F. Other Socioeconomic Determinants of Mlortality: Bivariate Analysis&#13;
Before examining multivariate studies which include income and&#13;
other determinants of mortality, we shall first report on the simple&#13;
correlations between various measures of life expectancy and mortality and&#13;
socioeconomic determinants of mortality. 2/ Bivariate analysis is useful&#13;
1/   When the specification was given for average income0of the whole    2&#13;
population and the Gini coefficient was included: eo = a + b/Y + c/Y&#13;
+ dG, the coefficient c was not significant.&#13;
2j A number of bivariate and multivariate studies have included health&#13;
inputs as well as socioeconomic variables. The interpretation of&#13;
these variables will differ in multivariate analysis depending on&#13;
whether they are considered as controls or intervening variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
primarily for illustrating the magnitude of association, but not for&#13;
inferring the causal importance of the relationship. Changes in relative&#13;
importance between bivariate and multivariate analysis are, however,&#13;
instructive in analyzing the causal structure. Given Rodgers' findings of&#13;
differences in the relationship between income and inequality and infant&#13;
mortality and life expectancy, one point that we wish to pay particular&#13;
attention to in the following analysis is the differences in the relationship&#13;
between infant and child mortality and measures of mortality which include&#13;
death at all ages. We shall begin with analysis of infant mortality.&#13;
Stockwell and Hutchinson (1975) provide a convenient comparison&#13;
of infant and child mortality and crude death rates. Their sample includes&#13;
between 60 and 70 countries for which data was available for the late&#13;
1960s.l/ The results of their analysis are summarized, with other findings,&#13;
in Table 2-4. All correlations had the expected sign and were significant,&#13;
but most variables were only significant at the 5 percent level in the&#13;
crude death rate correlation, while they were significant at a .001 level in&#13;
all other correlations. 2/ Adult literacy rates had the highest absolute&#13;
values in the correlations for the crude death rate and the deaths at&#13;
ages 1-4, and were the second highest among the variables correlated with&#13;
the other two measures of mortality. The proportion of calories from&#13;
animal protein had the largest absolute values in the infant and post&#13;
neonatal mortality correlations.&#13;
Overall caloric intake was much more important in the infant&#13;
and child mortality correlations than in the crude death rate. Not only&#13;
were calories from animals the most important variables in infant and post&#13;
neonatal mortality, but also total calories per day were the second highest&#13;
correlation coefficient in the deaths of infants aged 1-4.&#13;
While per capita income was significant in these correlations,&#13;
it was exceeded in all cases by literacy, and by at least one measure&#13;
of food intake, and, in three of four cases, by the proportion of active&#13;
population outside agriculture.&#13;
1/ The authors do not specify what proportion of the countries were&#13;
developed, but 17 of the countries were low mortality (infant mortality&#13;
under 25 per 1,000), 25 moderate mortality and 26 had infant mortality&#13;
in excess of 50 per 1,000.&#13;
2/ This finding may well reflect the fact that crude death rates are&#13;
determined to a large extent by the age structure of the population and&#13;
are therefore an inferior measure of the force of mortality.&#13;

- 20-&#13;
As part of a larger study, Som (1977) has presented correlation&#13;
coefficients for a number of socioeconomic and health indicators for crude&#13;
death rates and life expectancy at birth using data from 70 developing, and&#13;
25 developed, countries in the mid-1970s (his results are also summarized&#13;
in Table 2-4).  With the exception of health expenditures the variables&#13;
reported by Som are more highly correlated with life expectancies than with&#13;
the crude death rate. GNP per worker is the variable most highly correlated&#13;
with life expectancy, while the physicians per capita variable is the most&#13;
highly correlated with the crude death rate. In these measures, in contrast&#13;
to measures of infant and child mortality, caloric consumption is relatively&#13;
unimportant.&#13;
Another study of the bivariate relationship between life expectancy,&#13;
socioeconomic variables and health inputs has been completed as part of&#13;
the World Banks's research on Basic Needs. In a study of 86 developing&#13;
countries in the mid-1970s Hicks (1979) found the correlations of variables&#13;
with life expectancy that are summarized in the final column of Table 2-4.&#13;
(There were some variations in the number of countries used in individual&#13;
cases.)&#13;
These results, which are restricted to developing countries, are&#13;
in sharp contrast to those of Som with respect to calories per capita and&#13;
income per capita, and very similar with respect to urbanization and number&#13;
of doctors relative to population. Income per capita is much more important&#13;
in Som's sample, which includes developed and developing countries (.92&#13;
versus .52); while in the case of calories per capita Som finds them to be&#13;
much less important than does Hicks (.26 versus .71). These differences&#13;
may well reflect the fact that in developing countries income is a less&#13;
appropriate measure than it is in developed countries, since fewer goods&#13;
consumed by the household pass through the market in the former. The&#13;
strong relationship between caloric consumption and life expectancy in the&#13;
developing countries, but not'in the developed, may well reflect the fact&#13;
that there are diminishing returns to caloric intake and therefore the&#13;
linear relationship would appear weaker when' countries with very high&#13;
caloric intake are included.&#13;
But, overwhelmingly, the literacy rate has the highest correlation&#13;
in the developing countries. Unfortunately, Som does not include literacy&#13;
in his indicators, but one might well expect that in a sample including&#13;
developed and developing countries the correlations would be lower. This&#13;
would be because of the lack of variation in literacy rates among developed&#13;
countries.&#13;
The last study to be included here is Shin's analysis of infant&#13;
mortality (Shin, 1975). Shin has produced bivariate and multivariate&#13;
analysis of infant mortality for 63 countries (34 of which were developing&#13;
countries) for which data were available in 1958, 1963, and 1968. Table 2-4&#13;
also summarizes the zero order correlations for 1958, 1963 and 1968. Shin&#13;
also analyzed the change in infant mortality between 1958, and 1968. The&#13;
coefficients all have the expected sign, and are all significant in 1958 and&#13;
1968. The stability of the relationship between the two periods is remarkable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
One reason for this stability (as contrasted with the variation found&#13;
between periods in some of the studies cited earlier and later) may be that&#13;
the same sample of countries was used at both points in time. Newspaper&#13;
circulation, which was used as a proxy for literacy but probably includes&#13;
the effects of both education and income, had the largest corrplation.&#13;
Economic development was second in importance.&#13;
In the analysis of change over time Shin found lower associations&#13;
between changes in mortality and changes in socioeconomic variables than&#13;
he found for levels. This is similar to Preston's findings with respect to&#13;
changes over time in life expectancy and income. In the analysis of&#13;
changes over time, only changes in "development" and newspaper circulation&#13;
were significant and the relative rankings if these two variables are&#13;
reversed from those evidenced in the static analysis. We shall interpret&#13;
these results further when we discuss Shin's multivariate analysis.&#13;
In summary, then, bivariate analysis as summarized in Table 2-4&#13;
shows that literacy or other measures of education are more closely related&#13;
to mortality and life expectancy than is per capita income, particularly&#13;
when samples are restricted to developing countries, but the differences&#13;
seem greater for overall mortality measures than for measures of infant&#13;
mortality. In addition, caloric intake and calories from animal sources&#13;
are more important for infants and young children than is income and more&#13;
important in samples containing only developing countries. Whether or not&#13;
these patterns persist in multivariate analysis will now be discussed.&#13;
G. Other Socioeconomic Determinants of Mortality: Multivariate Analysis&#13;
While the bivariate analysis shows that a number of variables&#13;
are more highly correlated with measures of mortality than is per capita&#13;
income, this occurs at least in part because these variables are closely&#13;
related to per capita income and capture part of income's association with&#13;
mortality, as well as their own. While multivariate analysis does not&#13;
provide a perfect solution, it does enable one to get a rough approximation&#13;
of the relative importance of income while controlling for these other&#13;
variables, and of other variables while controlling for income.&#13;
In examining the following multivariate studies, we are particularly&#13;
concerned with the relative importance of literacy and income and for the&#13;
differential power of socioeconomic variables in explaining different&#13;
measures of mortality.&#13;
In examining the role of these other determinants relative to&#13;
income, we shall begin with Preston's work. In his 1976 NBER paper, he&#13;
estimated regression equations for life expectancy in 1940 and 1970 using,&#13;
in addition to per capita income (expressed in 1970 US dollars), daily&#13;
caloric consumption and literacy. 1/ In addition, following his earlier&#13;
1/ The sample included 36 countries in 1940 (17 of them developing countries)&#13;
and 120 in or around 1970.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
methodology, he attempted to estimate the proportion of change in life&#13;
expectancy due to these factors between 1940 and 1970 (this aspect will be&#13;
discussed later).&#13;
The results of his regression equations for the two periods&#13;
are as follows (t values are given in p,arentheses):&#13;
0&#13;
1940:  e  M -13.1035 + 5.4353  ln I + .1654 Lit + 2.9470  ln Cal&#13;
(2.28)         (2.66)      (.79)&#13;
2         -2&#13;
N   36 R  - .856, R       .845&#13;
1970:  e° -  -17.1464 + 4.2488  ln Y + .2086 Lit + .3170  ln Cal&#13;
0                (6.51)         (9.84)       (.23)&#13;
2 -  8,-2&#13;
N - 120 R  - .86, R  - .858&#13;
It should be noted at the outset that Prestonts results show that&#13;
all variables have the expected sign, but that in neither year do the coefficients&#13;
of daily caloric intake (measured as a deviation from 1500) approach statistical&#13;
significance. But the log of income and literacy are highly significant in&#13;
both periods. In terms of their relative importance, literacy has a higher&#13;
elasticity than income in both years. 1/ "The coefficients indicate that a&#13;
percent increase in the proportion literate is associated at both points with a&#13;
gain in life expectancy of approximately two years and that a 10 percent gain&#13;
in national income by itself increases life expectancy by approximately one-half&#13;
year" (Preston, 1976, p. 19).&#13;
The R2's and adjusted R2's in these equations are higher than those&#13;
in Preston's earlier equations (which included income with or without income&#13;
inequality) or those in Dyson, et al.'s sampLe from about the same period which&#13;
used only income. This is prima facie evidence of the very significant role&#13;
that literacy (or the variables associated with it) play in determining mortality.&#13;
1/   In 1940 the two variables have almost identical t values of 2.78 and&#13;
2.76 respectively.  But, in 1970, the t value for lnY is 6.54 and for&#13;
literacy 9.84.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
Isenman (1979) has estimated an equation similar to Preston's but using&#13;
the natural log of literacy and life expectancy. In addition, he has esti-&#13;
mated the same equation for infant mortality. The results are as follows:&#13;
Ln(e )     = 2.83  +  .065 Ln(Y) +  0.199 Ln(Lit)               R  = .88&#13;
°      (45.30)  (7.27)          (10.69)&#13;
_                     ~~~~~~~-2&#13;
Ln(INMort) = 8.90  - 0.454 Ln(Y) -  0.464 Ln(Lit)               R  = .74&#13;
(20.70) (-7.41)         (-3.63)&#13;
In the life expectancy formulation literacy has a higher t value&#13;
than income and the R2 for life expectancy increases from .65 to .88 with its&#13;
inclusion. For infant mortality, literacy is also significant, but it has a&#13;
lower t value than income and the R2S for infant mortality are only increased&#13;
From .68 to .74 by the inclusion of literacy.&#13;
A slightly more inclusive model of the determinants of cross-national&#13;
differences in life expectancy has recently been completed by Hicks (1979). -One of&#13;
the models tested includes literacy, income and caloric consumptiQn as well as&#13;
several other variables which measure access to health care. This regression&#13;
was calculated for 55 developing countries in the mid-1970s. The results&#13;
show that literacy is overwhelmingly the most important variable, but that&#13;
access to pure water and average caloric intake are marginally significant.&#13;
Per capita income proved to be the least significant variable when the other&#13;
measures of living standards and access to health care were included. Hicks'&#13;
results are as follows:&#13;
0&#13;
= 36.35 + .2336 Lit + .0688 Water + .00391 Cal - .000859 Phy&#13;
o             (6.4)        (1.8)          (1.9)         (1.6)&#13;
-.0489 FR - .1228 Pubcon - .0110 Urban - .0000497 YPC                     -2&#13;
(1.1)        (.3)            (.2)           (.04)                N = 55, R  = .835&#13;
In sum, these three different studies show that literacy is the&#13;
most important variable in'the multivariate analysis of life expectancy which&#13;
includes measures of per capita income, but that in multivariate analyses of&#13;
infant mortality it is less important.&#13;
One important question, however, that needs to be resolved is to what&#13;
extent these results would be altered by the inclusion of income distribution.&#13;
To what extent is literacy capturing the effects of income equality?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
In his paper Hicks added an income distribution term (the income&#13;
share of the lowest 40 percent) to his equation as cited above. The results&#13;
are as follows:&#13;
0&#13;
e - 36.445 + .1908 Lit + .4311 Y Dist - .0001817 Doc&#13;

(.5)          (.5)        (.5)&#13;
-2&#13;
N - 35, R - .802&#13;
These results show that literacy continues to be the most important&#13;
variable and that income distribution is the second in importance, while the&#13;
amount of calories per capita ceases to be important and the number of doctors&#13;
becomes significant. While these results cannot be compared directly with the&#13;
first equation, given-the much smller sample size, it seem reasonable to&#13;
conclude that "the fact that overall calorie supply drops in importance suggests&#13;
that the distribution of food, for which income distribution is a proxy, is&#13;
more important than the overall level of food supplies" (Hicks, 1979, pX8).&#13;
Another interesting analysis including literacy and income distribu-&#13;
tion was presented at the June 1979 conference on the socioeconomic determinants&#13;
and consequences of mortality(Chao, 1979; Silber, 1979). Dennis Chao's analysis&#13;
of cross-national mortality differentials included both literacy rates and Gini&#13;
coefficients of income inequality as well as per capita income and physicians&#13;
per capita. In addition, Chao added dummy variables for the three continents&#13;
of the developing world. His analysis was based on 40 countries from the&#13;
period 1960-1965. About half of these countries can be classified as developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
Chao's coefficients cannot easily be compared to Preston's or Hicks'&#13;
in terms of relative magnitude because he used a more complex formulation, but&#13;
the significance of the variables can be compared using t values.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
Chao's estimation equation was as follows:&#13;
o                                 y&#13;
e -&#13;
0       + e + B I + B2G + B L + B L + BP +BY  +BY  +    y&#13;

y is the asymptote,a is the constant.&#13;
where I  is per capita income&#13;
G  is the Gini coefficient&#13;
L  is the literacy rate&#13;
P  is the population per physician&#13;
Y1 is a dummy variable for Asia&#13;
Y2 is a dummy variable for Latin America&#13;
Y3 is a dummy variable for Africa&#13;
The results of estimation are given in Table 2-5.&#13;
The table shows that all of the variables were significant except&#13;
for the dummy variables for Asia and Latin America. 1/ In examining the values&#13;
of the coefficients and the t values, it must be recalled that the signs will&#13;
be the opposite from what they would be in a simple linear formulation since&#13;
all variables are in the denominator. All variables have the expected signs&#13;
and the asymptote of 72 is quite reasonable and highly significant. The&#13;
measure of income inequality has the highest t value of the explanatory variables&#13;
followed by income per capita. The literacy rate is considerably smaller, but&#13;
still significant and is followed closely by the number of physicians per&#13;
capita. The dummy variable for Africa has the smallest significant t value.&#13;
This variable indicates that African countries have a significantly lower life&#13;
expectancy than would be expected based upon the included socioeconomic variables.&#13;
This analysis certainly suggests that literacy is somewhat less&#13;
important when measures of income inequality are included but that literacy&#13;
still makes a substantial contribution, even when controlling for income&#13;
inequality. The fact that literacy is less important in Chao's analysis than&#13;
in Hicks' probably reflects the fact that Chao includes both developed and&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
1/   It is interesting to note that, in their simple income analysis for the&#13;
1960s, Preston and Gardner found that Asia had systematically higher&#13;
life expectancy than predicted and Latin America had systematically&#13;
lower (Preston and Gardner, 1976). This result does not appear to hold&#13;
when other variables are controlled in Chao's analyses.&#13;

One could also reestimate Freston's 1970 regression equation which&#13;
includes literacy and calorie intake using his measure of income inequality for&#13;
the 52 countries for which data is available. The results are as follows:&#13;
0&#13;
e  =  42.68 + 3.07(2.97) ln Y + .251(7.53) lit&#13;
+ .777(.345) ln (calories - 1500) - .119(.685) ln Index&#13;
This analysis shows rather surprisingly that income inequality is not signifi-&#13;
cant and that literacy continues to be the most significant variable.&#13;
The works cited above give a fairly comprehensive picture of the&#13;
importance of the major socioeconomic determinants of mortality and some&#13;
measures of health inputs in explaining life expectancy. There is also&#13;
some indication from the work of Rodgers and Isenman that infant mortality&#13;
behaves slightly differently than does life expectancy. By examining Shin's&#13;
multivariate analysis (1975) of infant mortality we obtain some basis for&#13;
comparing the relative importance of determinants of early mortality with&#13;
overall mortality. Unfortunately, Shin's analysis does not provide a direct&#13;
measure of income inequality. Table 2-6 summarizes Shin's results for 1958 and&#13;
1968.&#13;

In Shin's multivariate analysis of infant mortality, the R2s are&#13;
substantially bel6o those obtained for life expectancyo While this result&#13;
might be due to differences in samples or in the specification of the income&#13;
variable, it is consfstent with Rodger's and Isenman's findings of lower R2s&#13;
for infant mortality'-than life expectancy, using identical income specifications.&#13;
In multivariate analysis, the proxy for literacy is the only var-&#13;
iable that is statistically significant and its, standardized regression co-&#13;
efficient is three times that of the measure of economic development and&#13;
over ten times that of population pe,: phys'ician. Shin's multivariate analysis&#13;
thus tends to confirm ear'-ier avail1able evidence that the infant mortality is&#13;
not as well explained in general by socioeconomic va.a!isbles as life expectancy,&#13;
and that the relative importance o  t3ioc:oeconomic v  ::Ybles may differ between&#13;
the two measures of mortality.&#13;

An alternative way of assessing the role of changes in income,&#13;
education and caloric consumption on changing life expectancy over the period&#13;
is to estimate a "dynamic" regression equation for the 36 countries for which&#13;
data is available in both periods. Preston adds three other variables to&#13;
this dynamic equation. These are: first, MAL, the degree to which malaria was&#13;
endemic in 1940, a proxy for the effect of antimalarial programs; second, AID,&#13;
the average annual per capita nonmilitary aid in US dollars received between&#13;
1954 and 1972; and third, WAT, the per capita aid received for water and&#13;
sewerage projects between 1965 and 1970 The estimated equation is as follows:&#13;
1/   If mortality changes between 1960 and the mid-1970s became more dependent&#13;
on socioeconomic factors, as has been alleged, all of this increase in&#13;
explanation should not be attributed to the role of literacy and caloric&#13;
intake.&#13;

None of the socioeconomic variables approached significance. Only&#13;
the original level of malaria was significantly related to life expectancy&#13;
over the period. For the 17 developing countries in this sample, malaria&#13;
eradication accounted for 40 percent of the change in life expectancy and the&#13;
intercept in the dynamic formulation, which represents exogeneous factors,&#13;
accounted for 32 percent of the changes. Thus, for this subsample, 72 percent&#13;
of the life expectancy change was due to factors other than changes in income,&#13;
literacy or caloric consumption. This subsample, therefore seems atypical of&#13;
the total sample, where 50 percent of the mortality change was due to exogenous&#13;
factors. 1/&#13;
Shin estimated the relationship between the change in infant mortality&#13;
over the 1958-1968 period and the changes in the four explanatory variables.&#13;
A IM =  -.393 A D  -  .172 A N + .208  A P  +  .03 a U              2&#13;

Where:A IM is the percentage change in the infant mortality rate&#13;
and the other variables are the percentage changes in the dependent variable.&#13;
The coefficients shown are standardized Beta coefficients and&#13;
t values are given in parentheses.&#13;
1/   Part of this differential can be explained by differences in method.&#13;
Preston's (1976) article also showed higher endogenous change using&#13;
the first method than the second, dynamic, method.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
Although the overall R2 is fairly small, the change in economic-&#13;
industrial development is significant and changes in population per physician&#13;
approach significance. This finding indicates that greater increase in&#13;
"economic-industrial development" were associated with larger falls in infant&#13;
mortality, and reductions in population per physician were also associated with&#13;
larger decreases in infant mortality. Thus, not only do socioeconomic variables&#13;
differ cross-sectionally in their relationship to life expectancy and infant&#13;
mortality, but, apparently, they differ longitudinally as well.&#13;
H. Conclusion&#13;
In cross-sectional analysis of the type discussed in this chapter&#13;
several points become quite clear: per capita income is highly correlated with&#13;
life expectancy in all periods examined, but the elasticity of life expectancy&#13;
with respect to income levels has declined since the 1930s and 1940s; income&#13;
distribution seems to be significant in explaining life expectancy in most&#13;
studies, but somewhat less important in explaining infant mortality. It is not&#13;
completely clear whether income inequality in itself is important, or whether&#13;
it is factors associated with more equal distributions of income, such as&#13;
literacy or access to health services, which are important. In simple correlation&#13;
analysis literacy seems to be the most important variable explaining life&#13;
expectancy while caloric intake seems somewhat more important for infants and&#13;
young children. In all cases literacy has a higher level of significance than&#13;
does doctors per capita, but in some cases calories are less significant than&#13;
doctors. In the studies which include income inequality and literacy, the&#13;
results were mixed. Literacy always remains significant,-but income inequality&#13;
varies substantially in its relative and absolute importance, but was significant&#13;
in two of the three cases. Income per capita's significance varies greatly,&#13;
depending on what other variables are included.&#13;
It is certain that income distribution and literacy are extremely&#13;
important (in addition to per capita income) in explaining life expectancy at&#13;
any point in time. What is less certain, however, is what factors explain the&#13;
change in life expectancy over time. Our analysis shows that increases in&#13;
income are significantly related to increase in life expectancy for the 1930-63,&#13;
1930-70 and 1940-70 periods and only marginally significant in the 1940-63&#13;
period.&#13;
The effect of income appears to have had a higher coefficient in the&#13;
later, rather than in the earlier, periods, indicating that income changes&#13;
have become more important in explaining changes in life expectancy. Unfor-&#13;
tunately, no studies have hitherto been carried out to determine if this&#13;
pattern results form the increased association of income change with other&#13;
changes that affect life expectancy, such as literacy.&#13;
There are several altenative strategies available for exploring further&#13;
the socioeconomic determinants of mortality. The strategy that we chose to&#13;
follow is to look in much more detail at one aspect of the relationship between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
education and mortality, since this seems to be the most important variable.&#13;
We shall therefore first develop a theoretical model of the relationship at the&#13;
subnational level. The reasons for choosing to focus on an intracounty rather&#13;
than a cross-country review of evidence will become clear in the following&#13;
chapter, which takes up these themes.&#13;

III. TOWARD A MODEL OF THE EFFECTS OF EDUCATION ON HEALTH&#13;
Donald J. O'Hara&#13;
A.   Education and Health&#13;
Education and health are in many respects strikingly parallel&#13;
entities. Each is valued for itself and for the increased earnings it&#13;
makes possible. Each is ultimately produced by the individual (and&#13;
household) and embodied in the individual, but with substantial influence&#13;
and inputs from public sector policies. Each has an investment character,&#13;
in that resources devoted to either may produce returns over a long period&#13;
of time. These parallels appear in most analyses that examine health or&#13;
education separately; similar or identical factors are identified as&#13;
determinants of education and of health. The parallels become explicit and&#13;
virtually complete in the literature on human capital.&#13;
From this broad perspective, education and health are the joint&#13;
outcomes (along with other variables such as savings and labor force&#13;
participation) of individual (or household) decisions in the face of&#13;
"environmental" constraints ranging from climate through genetic endowment&#13;
to the price of medicine and school books (and the availability of public&#13;
health clinics and public schools). To speak of education as a determinant&#13;
of health is, in this broad view, no more precise or appropriate than to&#13;
speak of the size of a family's house as a determinant of the family's food&#13;
consumption (both being jointly determined by the climate, the family's&#13;
income, and the prices of housing and food). Similarly, one would not&#13;
speak of the number of public schools as a determinant of the number of&#13;
health clinics; both are instead the joint outcome of some public sector&#13;
allocation process (less well understood than that of the household) that&#13;
depends, for example, on such factors as climate, tax revenues (or community&#13;
income), and the salaries of teachers and nurses.&#13;
The above qualifications notwithstanding, this chapter will continue&#13;
to speak of education as a determinant of health. This not only provides&#13;
expositional simplicity, but it is also perhaps a reasonable first approx-&#13;
imation for the analysis of policies that act directly on education (by&#13;
increasing the availability of schools, reducing tuition, compelling&#13;
attendance, etc.). Further, it may be better than a first approximation&#13;
-- perhaps very near the whole truth -- for one important case: the effects&#13;
of parental education on children's health. 1/&#13;
1/   Of course, it is possible for parents to increase their own education,&#13;
which might draw resources away from their children's health and/or&#13;
enhance their income and ability to promote their children's health.&#13;
Adult literacy programs, in particular, may need to take account of&#13;
the joint determination of parental education and children's health.&#13;
Usually, however, the amount and kind of education will have been deter-&#13;
mined not so much by the parents as by their own parents and by the&#13;
public policies in effect when the parents were children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
The relationship between education and health will thus be tempor-&#13;
arily viewed as though one could increase the level of education and then&#13;
observe the resulting change in health, as in a controlled experiment. The&#13;
more complicated.-and realistic situation in which education and health are&#13;
jointly determined is taken up later in this chapter (section J) as a&#13;
preparation for interpreting data arising from just such complicated real&#13;
world situations. This chapter therefore sharpens the focus on one facet&#13;
of the socioeconomic determinants of mortality explored on a cross-national&#13;
basis in its predecessor.&#13;
B. The Effects of Education on Health&#13;
Education increases productivity.   This simple postulate is&#13;
the basis for almost all economic analyses of the effects of education.&#13;
Productivity is interpreted as output per unit of time input (by a person&#13;
of given education), holding other inputs constant (and of course ignoring&#13;
a few technicalities that must be confronted before one has a well-defined&#13;
quantitative measure of productivity). This framework is most commonly&#13;
applied to the production of goods and services organized through markets,&#13;
in which case higher productivity is reflected in higher wages (and incomes).&#13;
It can also be applied to nonmarket, or consumption, activity, in which&#13;
case higher productivity is reflected in higher quantities (or qualities)&#13;
of such final consumption goods as meals or health, for given inputs of&#13;
time and such market goods as food or medicine. 1/&#13;
Education should influence health through both these channels. The&#13;
higher income resulting from increased market productivity should lead&#13;
to increased expenditures on food, housing, and medical care, with improved&#13;
health as a consequence. Likewise, for a given expenditure on such market&#13;
goods, higher nonmarket productivity should result in a more efficient&#13;
conversion of market goods into the final consumption good, health, through&#13;
more nutritious diets, more conisistent sanitation, earlier diagnosis of.&#13;
illness and more effective purchase of drugs and medical care. In this&#13;
respect, it is at least conceptually useful t,o distinguish between a&#13;
general (perhaps neutral, in some technical sense) increase in productivity&#13;
in all nonmarket activities (including health production), and an increase&#13;
in productivity that only affects the production of health (or at least&#13;
that affects the production of health more than it affects the production&#13;
of other goods).&#13;
Different kinds of education may of course operate through these&#13;
channels in rather different proportions. A knowledge of diesel engine&#13;
repair would presumably operate primarily through higher income, while&#13;
training in home economics is designed to operate through nonmarket activity.&#13;
The latter, however, usually includes some coursework dealing specifically&#13;
with health, which presumably should be especially effective in increasing&#13;
1/   For the market productivity of education, see Denison (1962), Schultz&#13;
(1962), and Becker (1962). For nonmarket productivity, see Michael&#13;
(1973) and Grossman (1976). (References cited will be found at the&#13;
end of this chapter.]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
health through nonmarket channels. 1/ Education with a general content is&#13;
presumably effective only where it is used. For this reason, the nonmarket&#13;
influence of education on health presumably stems primarily from the&#13;
education of women; especially those women not in the labor force. Conversely,&#13;
the market influence of education on health presumably operates through&#13;
males and females actually in the labor force. 2/&#13;
For policy purposes, the distinction between market and nonmarket&#13;
influences on health (or on other variables) is especially important. If&#13;
the primary influence is through higher income, then education may be&#13;
compared in a straightforward manner with other means of raising income&#13;
(irrigation projects, industrial development incentives, etc.). If the&#13;
nonmarket influence is important, however, then cost-benefit comparisons&#13;
must be modified to incorporate this factor lest education (and, presumably,&#13;
women's education especially) be under-valued.&#13;
A final channel through which education might influence health is&#13;
through a change in "tastes." That is, increased education might increase&#13;
the value people place on health (without increasing either their earning&#13;
power or their effectiveness in converting food, sanitation and medical care&#13;
into health) and hence lead them to devote more of their time and resources&#13;
to health. "Changes in tastes" are not so much an explanation, in most econ-&#13;
omists' eyes, as another name for ignorance--anything that cannot otherwise&#13;
be explained can be attributed to a change in tastes. Nevertheless, certain&#13;
kinds of education (in "values"), advertising, and propaganda seem explicitly&#13;
designed to change tastes in a specified direction and hence should permit&#13;
falsifiable predictions about changes in behavior. Note also that there need&#13;
be no presumption that the change in taste resulting from education necessarily&#13;
leads to increased health--education may lead to a belief that strenuous exer-&#13;
cise is unbecoming an educated man, that breastfeeding is not the most "modern"&#13;
way of nourishing an infant, or that giving one's life for one's country is&#13;
virtuous. In any case, it is difficult to suggest tests using available data&#13;
that permit one to distinguish between increased nonmarket productivity and&#13;
changes in tastes favoring health. 3/ The analysis herein accordingly focuses on&#13;
changes in market and nonmarket productivity and leaves aside the question of&#13;
changes in tastes.&#13;
1/   Unfortunately for policy purposes, this presumption can scarcely be&#13;
tested using the existing literature because information on type or&#13;
content of education is rarely available in conjunction with health&#13;
data.&#13;
2/   Since data on husbands' and wives' education and labor force status are&#13;
sometimes available, it should be possible to get a rough idea of the&#13;
relative importance of the two channels.&#13;
3/   Similarly, changes in tastes against health (e.g. against breastfeeding)&#13;
may be hard to disentangle from increases in market productivity: higher&#13;
education may result in women working more outside the home and for that&#13;
reason breastfeeding less, without any change in tastes. Note that the&#13;
change in breastfeeding with education is only an example: one that is&#13;
plausible, but far from uniformly supported by the data (Leslie, 1979).&#13;

C. Whose Education? Whose Health?&#13;
It is important to recognize the possibility that the education&#13;
of one person may affect the health of others. Indeed, it mav be easier to&#13;
detect the influence of parents' education on their children's health than&#13;
on their own health (or on each other's health), because children's health&#13;
is more sensitive to current diet and environment than that of adults, who&#13;
seem to adjust to their diet and environment (and whose health is affected&#13;
not only by current circumstances but by their childhood experience). 1/&#13;
The education of each spouse will presumably affect the health of both.  This&#13;
is almost axiomatic if one takes the household as the decisionmaking&#13;
entity (maximizing a joint utility function), as is conventional in much&#13;
demand analysis. In this context, the total market and nonmarket resources&#13;
available to the household are used to achieve "the household's" ends. The&#13;
fact that, for example, education was embodied in the wife rather than the&#13;
husband would not change the household's ends, it would only mean that&#13;
increased health was achieved more by nonmarket than by market means.&#13;
A closer analysis of the household, however, reveals no such&#13;
perfect congruence of ends between spouses (nor between parents and children).&#13;
For many purposes, these intrahousehold conflicts of interest may not be&#13;
important. It does appear, however, that for fertility (or family-size)&#13;
decisions they can be significant (Cochrane and Bean, 1976), and it would seem&#13;
that an analysis of health decisions should at least consider the possible&#13;
implications of such conflicts. While the theory of intrahousehold decisionmaking&#13;
is in its infancy, and has not been subject to wide empirical testing, it seems&#13;
useful to split the analysis into those aspects involving:   (a) differences in&#13;
ends or goals; and (b) differences in the means achieving one's goals.&#13;
With respect to (a), in the context of health, it seems reasonable&#13;
to hypothesize that each spouse cares more about his or her own health than&#13;
about the spouse's health. It may also be reasonable (on both biological and&#13;
cultural grounds) to hypothesize that the mother will usually care more than&#13;
the father about the health of the children; in some cultures, the conflict&#13;
of interest between parents may be especially strong with respect to female&#13;
1/   Conversely, any apparent effect of children's education on their own&#13;
health is probably best interpreted not as a casual relationship but as&#13;
the joint outcome of parental decisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
children. 1/ In this study, no attempt is made to document the existence of&#13;
such conflicts, much less to quantify them, but their implications are sug-&#13;
gested here so that they do not confound other aspects of empirical inter-&#13;
pretation.&#13;
With respect to (b), the education of each spouse should increase that&#13;
spouse's means of achieving his or her desired ends, since increased productivity&#13;
increases that spouse's contribution to the household. Evidently, there is&#13;
no simple connection between a spouse's contribution to the household and the&#13;
extent of the spouse's control over the household's resources. By analogy&#13;
with the firm, one could view the household as producing its final goods&#13;
(health, etc.) and "paying" its factor inputs in kind, i.e., with control&#13;
over the use (and indeed the mix) of the final goods. A marginal productiv-&#13;
ity theory of factor payments, however, is probably not appropriate since&#13;
the spouses do not obtain each other's inputs in an atomistically competitive&#13;
market but in a situation of bilateral monopoly and hence bargaining. Even in&#13;
simple bargaining situations, theory can usually only specify that the outcome&#13;
will lie in a particular range, but cannot specify which particular allocation&#13;
will be achieved. Within the household, very complex factors, including sub-&#13;
stantial cultural constraints, affect the division of control over the use&#13;
of resources. One insight from bargaining theory that might be of use is that&#13;
the division of gains from the bargain is influenced by each bargainer's best&#13;
alternative other than the bargain. Applied to the household, this suggests&#13;
that to the extent education increases a spouse's opportunities outside the&#13;
marriage (either as an unmarried individual or in remarriage); it should also&#13;
increase that spouse's control over resources within the household. This is&#13;
consistent with the basic presumption that increased market or nonmarket&#13;
productivity resulting from increased education should increase a spouse's&#13;
control over the household's resources.&#13;
The strength of this effect may, however, vary widely and depend&#13;
heavily on the cultural context, and it may be that there is much wider&#13;
1/   A "conflict of interest" does not require that the father views his&#13;
daughter's health (much less existence) negatively while the mother&#13;
views it positively. All that is implied is a difference of opinion&#13;
between father and mother as to how a given quantity of resources&#13;
should be divided between improving the health of sons and improving&#13;
the health of daughters. A conflict exists if the father would choose&#13;
a 45-55 sons-daughters division while the mother would choose a 40-60&#13;
division; in this perhaps unrealistic example, both favor daughters&#13;
over sons, but not to the same extent, which gives rise to the conflict&#13;
of interest. A stronger conflict would exist if the father preferred&#13;
50-50 and the mother 35-65. While it seems instructive to explain&#13;
conflict of interest as a difference of opinion about the division of&#13;
a specified quantity of time and other resources between the health of&#13;
sons and daughters, the more fundamental question is the division of&#13;
the family's total resources between the health of each member and all&#13;
other uses. Thus, the parents could have small (or no) disagreement&#13;
about the fraction of the family's resources that should be devoted&#13;
to their sons' health and substantial disagreement about the fraction&#13;
that should be devoted to their daughters' health (or each other's&#13;
health).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39-&#13;
variation for wives than for husbands. In those situations where husbands&#13;
work for wages (as opposed to on family farms or in family-operated businesses),&#13;
there may be a nearly automatic relationship between increased productivity&#13;
as reflected in earnings and increased control over the family's resources.&#13;
For wives, however, increased market productivity may not translate so directly&#13;
into increased control over resources, even where the wife works in the market.&#13;
Increased nonmarket productivity of wives may be an intermediate case, but&#13;
this is quite speculative. 1/&#13;
Another way in which one person's education may affect another&#13;
person's health is through the influence of community-level variables:&#13;
the (average) level of education in a community may affect the health of&#13;
individual members. Any individual should typically experience better health&#13;
in a community where the education level is higher. This will result partly&#13;
from the fact that a better educated community will want and be able to afford&#13;
(and/or obtain through the political process) better public health, water and&#13;
sanitation facilities, and partly because better educated individuals and&#13;
their families will have better "private" health and hence will be less likely&#13;
to be a source of communicable diseases. Thus, where data is available, it&#13;
is of interest to distinguish between the average level of education in a&#13;
community and the individual (or household) level. It may be that where the&#13;
community level of education is low, individual education is highly "produc-&#13;
tive" of health, while if the community education level is high, even an&#13;
individual with little education will experience fairly good health. 2/&#13;
1/   Caldwell (1979) argues that, in the West African context, a substantial&#13;
increase in command over household resources accrues to educated women&#13;
and that this is a primary mechanism through which wife's education gen-&#13;
erates improved child health.&#13;
2/   While a given individual with, say, an eighth-grade education will have&#13;
better health in a community with an average education level of eight&#13;
years than in a community with an average education level of four&#13;
years, the fact that education is at least partly under the control of&#13;
the individual (and his or her parents) makes it necessary to exercise&#13;
care in interpreting data. The average health of a community with an&#13;
average education level of eight years may not be as high as the health&#13;
level of those few individuals who manage to obtain an eighth-grade&#13;
education where the community average is four years.&#13;
In technical terms, the marginal health product of individual education&#13;
is negatively related to the community education level:&#13;
h = h(ei,ec), hei, hec &gt; 0&#13;
but   hei,ec&#13;
so that   hei/ec=low   large&#13;
but hei/ec=high = small.&#13;
or, if   h = .a + f-ei + K-ec + %-ei-ec&#13;
then   6,  &gt; O,&#13;
but     &lt; 0.&#13;
&#13;

D. A Model of the Household Production of Health&#13;
This section outlines somewhat mDre formally the above framework&#13;
for analyzing the effects of education on health. The objective is to pro-&#13;
vide a basis for interpreting empirical relationships between education and&#13;
health both with and without "controls" for other variables (it will turn&#13;
out that wre controls are not necessarily better, or more precisely, that&#13;
not every variable can properly be treated as a control variable).&#13;
As described above, the household is viewed as producing health&#13;
using purchased inputs (food, medical care), publicly supplied inputs&#13;
(purified water, health clinics), and the time of household members. 1/&#13;
Similarly, the household produces other "final consumption goods" (recrea-&#13;
tion, meals) using a variety of inputs (radios, radio broadcasts, listening&#13;
time; food, fuel, water, cooking and eating time). Focusing on health, one&#13;
may write, generically, the household's production function:&#13;
Health - P (purchased inputs, publicly supplied inputs, household&#13;
uebers' time inputs; education; individual and random&#13;
factors)&#13;
The somewhat separate treatment of education and of individual and random&#13;
factors, indicated by semicolons, will be discussed shortly. Similar func-&#13;
tions exist for other final consuuption goods such as recreation and meals.&#13;
The household is assumed to allocate its time and other resources so as to&#13;
1/   This analysis treates health as a final consumption good, valued for&#13;
itself, and not simply as an input to the production process in the&#13;
form of "healthy work days" (Grossman, 1976).&#13;
There may be a few publicly-supplied inputs, such as anti-malaria&#13;
programs, that improve health without any real household production,&#13;
participation or even awareness. The household production perspective&#13;
is still usable (these publicly supplied inputs produce health without&#13;
any cooperating privately purchased inputs or time), but it difficult&#13;
to see how education can have any impact on the production of health&#13;
in such cases.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
achieve what it views as the best achievable comoination of final consumption&#13;
goods. 1/&#13;
The achievable combinations of goods are thus constrained by the&#13;
production functions (one for each good), 2/ by the amounts of publicly&#13;
supplied inputs (assumed unalterable by the household, but see section H&#13;
below), and by two types of constraints that cut across goods: a time con-&#13;
straint for each household member and a budget constraint for the household&#13;
as a whole. The time constraints simply state that the amount of time each&#13;
member spends in both producing final consumption goods (including perhaps&#13;
pure leisure) plus working for wages in the market (or producing goods for&#13;
sale in the market--a complication ignored here) cannot exceed the total time&#13;
available (per week, month, year, etc.). The budget constraint states that&#13;
the household's total expenditure on purchased inputs cannot exceed its total&#13;
income from market work and assets (for example, rent earned on housing or&#13;
farm land owned by the family or imputed rent on owner-occupied housing&#13;
or owner-cultivated land). This may be written schematically as:&#13;
1/   This is, of course, the purposive behavior usually assumed by economists.&#13;
It is not, however, what is sometimes attributed to a caricature&#13;
called "economic man"--there is room Lor ignorance (and education!), for&#13;
mistakes and imperfect foresight (subsumed in random factors), for in-&#13;
dividual tastes (one of the random factors), and for cultural values&#13;
and traditions (in the constant term within a culture, in dummy&#13;
variables or the random factor across cultures). Households are not&#13;
assumed to maximize income (or longevity, or to have any other single&#13;
objective) but instead to choose the best, in their eyes, achievable&#13;
combination of various objectives.&#13;
On the other hand, though their views as to what is "best" may&#13;
be strongly influenced by tradition, culture, and religion, they are&#13;
still assumed to choose; behavior is purposive, not mechanical or&#13;
rigid as might be attributed to some caricature of "sociological man."&#13;
If this alleged middle ground between caricatures is to be&#13;
useful, there must be a substantial, systematic response in house-&#13;
hold choices to identifiable changes in the environment that con-&#13;
fronts them. While there is room for culture and individuality&#13;
(constant terms and random factors), there must also be room left&#13;
for system and purpose. Whether this is in fact the way the world&#13;
works is perhaps best settled not a priori or by introspection but&#13;
by the extent to which analysis based on that premise is useful in&#13;
understanding the behavior of real-world people.&#13;
2/   The a!svnmption of a separate production funct on for each final con-&#13;
sumwtion good ("no joint production") is an o-ersimplificatlon but&#13;
necessary for expositlonal (and most analytic) purposes. It implies,&#13;
for axamp7e, that the amount of health produced from given in7uts of&#13;
food, medical care and tine does not depend or th- !eve. of   o&amp;con&#13;
of other final consumpti... goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
Expenditures on purchased inputs - Labor income + Asset income&#13;
or        p1q1        2          nn - wh(eh)lh + w (e )l  + A&#13;
where:&#13;
Pi and q are respectively the price per unit and the quantity&#13;
purchasel of the it  purchased input, i = l...n;&#13;
A is asset income;&#13;
w is the (hourly/weekly) wage rate of the husband (h) or wife (w) l/;and&#13;
1 is person j's work time (hours, weeks).&#13;
Note that the individual's wage-rate depends on his or her education. For&#13;
expository purposes, it is convenient to write each individual's time con-&#13;
straint as T = lI+ hi where T is the total time available, 1 is market work,&#13;
and hj is time d-evoted to production within the household (wiich could be&#13;
further divided into time devoted to the production of each of the final&#13;
consumption goods). Then the budget constraint can be written:&#13;
pqi   wh(eh) (T-hh) + w (e ) (T-h ) + A&#13;
or&#13;
'iqi   wh(eh)hh + w (ew)hw   wh(%)T + w(e )T + A&#13;
Thus, the left-hand side of the equation is the total cost of inputs to household&#13;
production, including the cost of household member's time evaluated at what&#13;
it could have earned in the market. The right-hand side of the equation is&#13;
referred to as the household's "full income,"that is, the full (potential)&#13;
value of income from its time and other resources.&#13;
1/   Both the notation above and the examples in section F consider only&#13;
husband and wife; the time of children or extended family members could be&#13;
straightforwardly incorporated if important in a particular situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
E.   A Supply and Demand Interpretation&#13;
The familiar concepts of supply and demand can now be used to analyzc&#13;
the effects oi education on health.   In the model as written thus far, educa-&#13;
tion appears in two places. First, in the household's production function for&#13;
health (and also in similar production functions for other goods). Second, it&#13;
appears as a determinant of the wage rate (the only determinant so far) that&#13;
an individual can earn in the market. The appearance in the production func-&#13;
tion represents the increase in nonmarket productivity discussed in the&#13;
previous section. In some way (not made explicit) more education 1/ leads to&#13;
more (or better) health for given amounts of inputs. This shift in the pro-&#13;
duction function can be translated into a shift in the cost function (under&#13;
quite general assumptions) and represented as a downward shift in the supply&#13;
(or marginal cosL) function (that is, the supply of healtt by the household&#13;
to itself).  This is represented by the shift from S to S   in Figure 3.1.&#13;
The second effect of education is on household members' wage rates,&#13;
appearing on both sides of the final form of the budget constraint. The&#13;
effect of education on wage rates is well documented, even for less developed&#13;
countries, and represents the increase in market productivity emphasized in&#13;
the preceeding section. Again, there may be differences in the effect on&#13;
wages depending on type of education, but the present level of analysis does-&#13;
not seem to require a more detailed treatment. Also, it should be noted that&#13;
there are other influences on wages, and hence other policies besides educa-&#13;
tion for influencing health through wage changes.&#13;
I/   That is, education of one or more members of household; a more detailed&#13;
specification would be&#13;
Health = f (purchased inputs, publicly supplied inputs, time inputs;&#13;
eh ; e ; individual -nd random factors)&#13;
It is natural to assume that education will have larger impact if it is&#13;
embodied in the household member(s) whose time is used to produce health,&#13;
but the education of other members could also have some effect.&#13;
The size and mechanism of education's effect way depend not only on&#13;
the "amount" (years completed or grades received) but on its content.&#13;
General literacy should facilitate acquiring and using information about&#13;
foods and medicines from newspapers and product labels for example. More&#13;
specific education may deal directly with food storage practices, personal&#13;
hygiene and disease symptoms. There may be important policy questions&#13;
for which it would be important to know the differences in effect between&#13;
general and health-specific education, but there does not seem to be any&#13;
need to separate them at this level of anaiysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
On the left-hand side of the budget constraint, higher wages repre-&#13;
sent higher opportunity costs of time inputs to the production of final con-&#13;
sumption commoditi's, including health, and hence translate into an upward&#13;
shift in the houshiold's telf-supply curve for health, represented in Figure 3.1&#13;
by a shift from S    to S  .   In the diagram, the net effect (S to S1)&#13;
is shown as a downward shift in the supply curve but this need not be the&#13;
case. The opposite could arise, for example, from education that primarily&#13;
affected the market skills of someone whose time was a major input, with few&#13;
and imperfect substitutes, to the household's health production.l/&#13;
On the right-hand side of the budget constraint, an increase in w&#13;
(due to an increase in education or other causes) is an increase in the house-&#13;
hold's full income. This can be represented as an outward shift in the house-&#13;
hold's demand for health (D to D in Fig. 3.1), assuming that health is a&#13;
normal good (one for which the demand increases as income increases), an&#13;
assumption which does not seem to be open to much question.&#13;
As long as the net shift in supply is downward or not too much&#13;
upward, the net effect of increased education on health will be positive&#13;
(H to H ). 2/ Despite the fact that the nonmarket effect of education&#13;
tends to increase health, no stronger theoretical conclusion can be obtained&#13;
at this level of generality because the market effect (higher wages) shifts&#13;
both demand and supply. By examining specific situations, however, more&#13;
definite results can sometimes be obtained.&#13;
F.   Special Cases&#13;
Three special cases will not be discussed.&#13;
(i) Husbands: If the individual works but does not devote significant&#13;
time to household health production, as might be the case with husbands, the&#13;
situation is simpler. Since the individual spends no time producing health,&#13;
the supply curve cannot be shifted by his edtcation. Any increase in market&#13;
productivity shifts the demand curve outward, leading unambiguously to in-&#13;
creased health.&#13;
(ii) Wives in the labor force: For working wives, simple extreme cases&#13;
can be obtained by assuming that education is of a type that only (or pre-&#13;
dominately) increases productivity in a single area market or nonmarket.&#13;
Such specialized education is surely within the realm of possibility, although&#13;
only rarely will data specify educational content. Education that affects&#13;

only health nonmarket productivity leaves the demand curve (Fifure 3.1)&#13;
unchanged anI unambiguous shifts the supply curve down (S to S 1; there is no&#13;
shift from S 1 to S1 because there has been no change in the market wage, which&#13;
is the opportunity cost of time used to produce health). Thus, there is an&#13;
unambiguous increase in health.&#13;
Education that affects all forms of nonmarket productivity shifts&#13;
the supply curve down (S to S11 as before) and also shifts the demand curve&#13;
outward, because the higher productivity in nonhealth areas acts like an&#13;
increase in income. Again, there is an unambiguous increase in health.&#13;
Education that affects only market productivity shifts the demand&#13;
curve iytwardland the supply curve upward. The upward shift is like that&#13;
from S   to S  , but starting from S since there has been no increase in&#13;
health productivity. The effect on health is ambiguous; health will increase&#13;
if the demand effects outweigh the supply effects. 1/ It is not entirely&#13;
implausible for increased market productivity to lead to decreased health.&#13;
Consider an initial situation in which the wife has a wage-rate equal to the&#13;
husband's and hence contributes half the household's full income (no asset&#13;
income). Suppose specialized education increases her wage by 20 percent and&#13;
hence the household's full income by 10 percent. If the income elasticity of&#13;
health is .5 (health being a "necessity") the demand for health will shift out&#13;
by .5 x 10% = 5%. On the supply side, suppose that initially one-half the&#13;
cost of producing health was the wife's time, and ignore any possibility of&#13;
substituting other inputs for the wife's time as its opportunity cost rises.&#13;
Then a 20 percent increase in the wife's wage increases the supply price of&#13;
health by .5 x 20% = 10%.  If the price elasticity of demand for health&#13;
exceeds .5 in absolute value, which is just moderately elastic, then health&#13;
will decline. If the household had been assumed to have asset income, or if&#13;
the husband's initial wage had exceeded that of the wife, then the income&#13;
effect of the wife's wage change would have been smaller; health decreases&#13;
would then occur with even smaller absolute price elasticities.&#13;
(iii) Wives not in the labor force: All of the above discussion assumes&#13;
that the individual works at least some of the time in the market (and could&#13;
work mDre or less if desired: that is what makes the market wage the appropriate&#13;
measure of the opportunity cost of time used in household production). Many&#13;
people, wives especially, do not work in the market and the presumption is that&#13;
the value of even the last hour of their time in household production exceeds&#13;
the wage they could earn in the market. In technical terms, their "shadow&#13;
wage" in household production exceeds their market wage. Hence, an increase&#13;
in market productivity is irrelevant unless it is large enough to lead to labor&#13;
force entry, in which case the effects are essentially those discussed just&#13;
above.&#13;

The first term is positive and the second negative.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
For persons who remain outside the labor force, education that&#13;
increases only health productivity again unambiguously leads to increased&#13;
health. Education that increases all forms of nonmarket productivity leads&#13;
however, to the full complexity of the general case. The increase in health&#13;
productivity shift's the supply curve outward, as before, while productivity&#13;
increases in other areas shift both supply and demand, much like an increase in&#13;
the market wage. That is, increased general household productivity increases&#13;
the range of combinations of final consumption goods achievable by the household;&#13;
this is equivalent to an increase in full income and thus leads to an outward&#13;
shift in demand for health. At the same time, increased general household&#13;
productivity increases the value of the individual's time in other-than-health-&#13;
producing activities and hence increases the opportunity cost or shadow wage of&#13;
time devoted to health production. This higher "shadow wage," just like a&#13;
higher market wage, shifts the supply price of health upward. I/ One might&#13;
reasonably suppose that the net effect will be to increase health, but it must&#13;
be recognized that there are some circumstances in which the reverse would&#13;
occur (e.g., a low income elasticity of demand for health combined with a high&#13;
time-intensity in the production of health).&#13;
These three special cases illustrate the several effects of education&#13;
on health, but they cannot often be used to examine existing empirical work&#13;
because the content of education (market vs. nonmarket; health-specific&#13;
vs. general nonmarket) is not usually specified. For education of general&#13;
(or unknown) content, an unambiguously positive relationship between education&#13;
and health is obtained only for individuals ("husbands") who devote no time&#13;
to household health production.  For others ("wives"), theory permits, but&#13;
does not require, a positive relationship. Since it is precisely here that&#13;
the nonmarket effects of education come into play, empirical examination&#13;
of the effect of the wife's education on family health is especially important.&#13;
G.   A Model Incorporating Other Determinants of Health&#13;
The effects of education on health can be ascertained empirically&#13;
only if proper account is taken of other determinants of health. A full and&#13;
complete model would involve the simultaneous determination of health and&#13;
all other final consumption goods; however, the following schematic model&#13;
seems to capture the most important determinants of health:&#13;
1/   Increases in nonhealth household productivity did not shift the supply&#13;
curve for working wives in case (ii) because in that case the opportunity&#13;
cost of time devoted to health production is the market wage. Increases&#13;
in nonhealth household productivity lead to a re-allocation of time from&#13;
market activity, but in the new equilibrium the opportunity cost of time&#13;
in health production (and all other nonmarket activities) is still the&#13;
market wage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
(1) Wage = F (education, cooperating inputs, individual&#13;
factors; random term)&#13;
(2) Full income = f (asset income, wages of household members) 1/&#13;
(3) Supply Price of Health = F (quantity supplied, pur-&#13;
(or Marginal Cost of      chased input prices, publicly-&#13;
Health)                  supplied input quantities, price&#13;
of time input (wages); education;&#13;
random term)&#13;
(4)  Demand for Health -  F   (Supply price, full income, supply&#13;
prices of other final consumption&#13;
goods, individual factors; random&#13;
term)&#13;
In this model, education is assumed to be exogenous. Education and other&#13;
exogenous variables determine each household member's wage (market or "shadow").&#13;
These wages, together with asset income, determine the household's full income.&#13;
Wage rates then enter the supply function and full income enters the demand&#13;
function. Empirical analysis of the effects of education on health must control&#13;
for the noneducation variables in each function.&#13;
For market wages, the noneducation factors include the standard&#13;
items in theoretical wage equations: labor-market and job-specific experi-&#13;
ence, individual initiative and innate ability, and perhaps place of residence&#13;
(urban vs. rural) and sector of employment (modern vs. traditional). Cooper-&#13;
ating inputs include capital, land and other types of labor (per capita), and&#13;
may be especially important in international cross-sections (factor-price&#13;
equalization theorems notwithstanding). For "shadow" wages, there is less&#13;
guidance from the literature; presumably the same initiative and ability&#13;
factors are relevant, and cooperating inputs would take the form of household&#13;
durables and other household members (e.g., grandparents). The durables, at&#13;
least, would not be exogenous in a more complete model.&#13;
1/   If all (adult) members work in the market, then full income is deter-&#13;
mined using market wages, as in the budget constraint given earlier.&#13;
If "shadow" wages must be used for some household members then the deter-&#13;
mination of full income is more complicated, but the essential implica-&#13;
tions are unaltered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
Full income is determined by wages and by asset income; the latter&#13;
may be negligible in developing countries except in agriculture, where measures&#13;
of the amount or value of the household's land may be available.&#13;
The supply price (or marginal cost) function can be conceptually&#13;
derived from the health production function introduced in Section D above.&#13;
There are two important groups of noneducation variables here: prices of&#13;
purchased inputs to the production of health (food, medicine) and quantities&#13;
of publicly-supplied inputs (clinics, purified water).&#13;
Finally, the demand for health function has as exogenous noneduca-&#13;
tion variables the supply prices of other final consumption goods (exogenous&#13;
only by assumption, but unobservable in any case) and "individual factors,"&#13;
which here represent systematic differences in the taste for health by ethnic&#13;
or religious group, for example.&#13;
Unfortunately, the supply price of health is not observable. This&#13;
precludes estimation of the entire structural system, at least without further&#13;
assumptions. However, education levels (E and El in Figure 3.1) and associated&#13;
health levels (H and H1 ) will be observed. This makes it possible to estimate&#13;
a reduced-form equation for quantity of health, in which health is a function&#13;
of education and all other exogenous variables. The reduced form captures the&#13;
net effect of education on health. It combines effects that work through market&#13;
or "shadow" wages and effects that work through shifts in the health production&#13;
function.&#13;
&#13;

H.   Omitted Exogenous Variables in Four Types of Sample&#13;
To obtain unbiased estimates of the effect of education in a reduced-&#13;
form equation, it is necessary to include 1/ any exogenous variable that is&#13;
correlated with education in the sample at hand. 2/ Table 3.1 summarizes the&#13;
presumed direction of correlation between education and the various classes of&#13;
exogenous variables for four general types of samples, discussed in turn below.&#13;
The correlations are tentative and for the most part a priori, but they provide&#13;
rough guidance as to the problems likely to arise when certain variables are&#13;
omitted from analyses of the various types of sample.&#13;
1/   Henceforth, the exposition will be primarily in the language of regression&#13;
analysis, but it can be readily translated to cross-tabular analysis by&#13;
replacing "inclusion of" by "control for."&#13;
2/   It may be worth recalling the formula for the bias due to omitted&#13;
variables. If the true relationship is&#13;
Health =a + a .  Education + i  . Another Variable  +  u&#13;
or   H   -a+ 0 .  E        +A.X  +   u&#13;
(where u is a random disturbance term). If the regression H = a&#13;
+ bE + cX is estimated, the expected value of b is the true co-&#13;
efficient on education, S. If, however, X is omitted and the&#13;
regression H - a + bE is estimated, the expected value of the&#13;
coefficient on education will be&#13;
n +    . z (E-E)  (X-X)&#13;
z (E-E) 2&#13;
where  E  and  X  are sample means of E and X. Thus, if  X  has a&#13;
positive effect on health ( '6positive) and is positive correlated&#13;
with E in the sample ( E(E-E) (X-X) positive), then the estimated&#13;
coefficient of E when X is omitted will be larger than the true&#13;
coefficient. For example, husband's education (X) is positively cor-&#13;
related with wife's education (E) in almost all societies, and husband's&#13;
education presumably has a positive effect on the health of the couple's&#13;
children, either directly or through income. If husband's education&#13;
is omitted, the coefficient on wife's education will overstate the&#13;
actual effect of wife's education. A program that increases literacy&#13;
among adult women (but not men) will have a smaller effect on child&#13;
health than the coefficient suggests.&#13;

-52-&#13;
(1) A sample of households within a "locality": A "locality" for present&#13;
purposes is an area within which the exogenous variable is constant, or nearly&#13;
so. Since the variable does not vary, it cannot be correlated with education&#13;
and hence no bias can arise from omitting it. 1/ (Indeed, if it is perfectly&#13;
invariant it must be omitted.) A village would probably be a locality in this&#13;
sense with respect to the prices of all purchased inputs and the quantities&#13;
of all publicly supplied inputs. A district (containing many villages) or a&#13;
large city might be a locality with respect to the price of food but not with&#13;
respect to availability of (or distance to) a public health clinic.&#13;
(2) A sample of households across localities (villages, districts,&#13;
regions, or infrequently, nations): By definition of locality, some exogenous&#13;
variables vary across localities. If they are also correlated with household&#13;
education level, then their omission will bias the coefficient of education.&#13;
If households are sampled randomly within each locality, as is usually the&#13;
case, then household education will be correlated with the average education&#13;
level in the locality, 2/ and there are a number of mechanisms by which a&#13;
correlation could arise between a locality's education level and exogenous&#13;
variables. For example, if sewers are provided by localities, then better educated&#13;
localities will have higher average incomes (or "fiscal capacity") and will&#13;
be more likely to (or better able to afford to) provide sewers, producing&#13;
a positive correlation between the presence of sewers and household education&#13;
in the sample. For a reverse example, if public health clinics are provided&#13;
by a central government, it may (depending on the political process) choose&#13;
to locate them "where the need is greatest," that is, in areas of low average&#13;
income and education, producing a negative correlation between the presence of&#13;
health clinics and household education level.&#13;
(3) A sample of aggregates (villages, districts, regions) within a&#13;
country: Correlations among aggregate-level variables are often stronger than&#13;
among household-level variables. For example, the correlation between male&#13;
and female average education in villages is stronger than the correlation&#13;
between husband's and wife's education in households. All of the correla-&#13;
tions, suggested just above, between village education levels and other&#13;
village-level variables are a fortiori potentially troublesome here. (There&#13;
are also the standard caveats summarized by the term "aggregation problems,"&#13;
but these seem to provide no special insights into the interpretation of&#13;
aggregate relations between education and health.)&#13;
1/   Note that most instances of "omission" of a variable are not due to a&#13;
mistake or oversight by the analyst. Rather, data on the variable are&#13;
simply unavailable, not having been collected in the original survey or&#13;
other data source. Thus it is usually not possible actually to check&#13;
for correlation between included and "omitted" variables. One must rely&#13;
on theory, common sense, or data from similar situations to infer the&#13;
presence of such correlation.&#13;
2/   The problem could in theory be avoided if sampling within each locality&#13;
were by education level; e.g., identical ratios of illiterates to liter-&#13;
ates in each locality, regardless of the locality's literacy rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
(4) International cross-sections of aggregates: Here there are strong&#13;
and pervasive correlations amng the exogenous variables and any attribution&#13;
of differences in health to differences in a single variable such as educa-&#13;
tion is likely to be difficult and inherently imprecise.&#13;
Note that the correlation of education with other exogenous var-&#13;
iables generally gets stronger as one moves from sample type (1) to sample&#13;
type (4) in Table 3.1. Thus an equation that includes only education as a&#13;
determinant of health will probably produce successively larger overestimates&#13;
of the effect of education on health as one moves from sample type (1) to&#13;
sample type (4).&#13;
I.   Including "Inappropriate" Controls&#13;
At this point it might appear that inclusion of as many variables&#13;
as possible would be desirable. Unfortunately, this is not so. Not all&#13;
variables are "control" variables, and the most troublesome are those that&#13;
may be thought of as (endogenous) "intervening" variables: clinic visits,&#13;
breast-feeding, use of sanitary latrines, food expenditure, housing quality.&#13;
All of these are variables over which the household has some control and&#13;
whose level is likely to be influenced by education, either directly through&#13;
increased knowledge or indirectly through increased income. 1/&#13;
Often in the literature a few endogenous input variables are included&#13;
in a regression along with education and/or wages or income. This produces&#13;
neither a reduced form nor a well-defined structural equation. The coeffi-&#13;
cients on the included inputs capture their own influence on health and per-&#13;
haps some of the influence of omitted inputs (even though both are ultimately&#13;
due in part to education). The education coefficient picks up some of the&#13;
effects of omitted inputs plus education's "pure" productivity effect in the&#13;
health production function. (Also, if ordinary least squares is used, the&#13;
coefficients are affected by simultaneous-equations bias.) Thus the "effect"&#13;
of education estimated in this way is some mixture between the narrow health-&#13;
productivity effect and the total effect captured by the reduced form.&#13;
The precise mixture will depend upon which endogenous health inputs are included&#13;
in the equation.&#13;
An important special case of an "inappropriate" control is household&#13;
income, at least in most cases. It may be tempting to include income along&#13;
with education in an attempt to separate the market effects of education from&#13;
the nonmarket effects. Unfortunately, household income in most cases is a&#13;
poor measure of full income, because it depends not only on wage rates but on&#13;
1/   If a comprehensive set of inputs, including time inputs, were used and&#13;
education included, one would obtain an estimate of the household pro-&#13;
duction function for health. The coefficient on education would then&#13;
measure solely the increased productivity of health from given inputs;&#13;
there would be no account of the increased levels of inputs made possible&#13;
by increased productivity elsewhere in the household or in the market,&#13;
and also no account of the X-efficiency choice of a more appropriate&#13;
combination of inputs. Unfortunately, a comprehensive set of input&#13;
variables is virtually impossible to obtain.&#13;

hours or weeks worked, and this varies substantially for women in most coun-&#13;
tries. If, for example, women with more education work more in the market,&#13;
household income will increase faster with education than full income, biasing&#13;
both the estimated education and income coefficients. A better procedure (but&#13;
one that is not always possible) is to use wage rates for husband and wife;&#13;
this avoids the influence of the endogenous decision on hours worked in the&#13;
market.&#13;
Both for policy purposes and simply for achieving enough compara-&#13;
bility across studies to permit discussion, it seems better to focus on&#13;
estimates of the total effect of education on health. For this purpose, one&#13;
needs an equation that includes those exogenous variables likely to be cor-&#13;
related with education in the sample at hand (as in Table 3.1) and excludes&#13;
endogenous variables, especially those "intervening" variables that contri-&#13;
bute to health and whose levels are influenced by the household. Thus, in&#13;
reviewing multiple regression studies in the following chapter, greatest&#13;
attention will often be focused on a specification (most authors report several)&#13;
that does not include all the available (or even all the statistically significant)&#13;
variables.&#13;
J. The Simultaneous Determination of Education and Health&#13;
The preceding sections have treated education as a determinant&#13;
of health and have assumed away any effect of health on education. For paren-&#13;
tal education and child health it was argued that this is a reasonable assump-&#13;
tion. For the population as a whole, however, it is suggested below that&#13;
education and health are jointly determined, violating the assumption that&#13;
education affects health but not vice versa.&#13;
As noted earlier, child health and child education are jointly&#13;
determined by parents; child education does not cause child health. The&#13;
same logic applies to parental health and education, as a result both of the&#13;
parents own decisions as adults and of their parents' decisions during child-&#13;
hood. The links from health to education are, moreover, direct and likely to&#13;
be important. On biological grounds, healthier children appear to learn more&#13;
and more quickly and to stay in school longer. Further, the prospect of better&#13;
future health and longer life-expectancy will lead households to invest more&#13;
in the education of their children at any given level of current child health&#13;
(O'Hara, 1975).&#13;
In the population as a whole, education and health are thus jointly&#13;
determined, with substantial influences running from health to education.&#13;
An empirical relationship "explaining" life expectancy in part by&#13;
literacy rates (say, at age six and above) does not, therefore, capture any clear causa&#13;
mechanism. 1/ Indeed, a skeptical view might deny any causal interpretation&#13;
whatever; in this view such relationships capture only a certain consistency&#13;
(across nations, provinces or districts) in the levels of health and educa-&#13;
tion chosen. At the very least, the coefficient on literacy in this type&#13;
of empirical relationship cannot be taken as a reliable estimate of the health&#13;
effects of literacy or education programs.&#13;
1/   Since income is strongly influenced-by education, similar objections&#13;
apply to regressions 'explaining" life-expectancy by income per capita.&#13;

IV. PARENTAL EDUCATION AND CHILD HEALTH: INTRACOUNTRY EVIDENCE&#13;
Susan H. Cochrane, Joane Leslie and Donald J. O'Hara&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
There are two ways of estimating the effect of parental education&#13;
on child health. The more complete, but more difficult, approach is&#13;
to estimate the effect of education through its various channels, income,&#13;
wages, health knowledge, etc. The data requirements for such an approach,&#13;
however, are formidable. An alternative approach is to estimate the net&#13;
effect of education (ignoring the channels through which it operates). The&#13;
data needed for the latter are somewhat less formidable, but it is still&#13;
necessary to control for other exogenous variables which might be determinants&#13;
of health, but are not affected by (but may be correlated with) education.&#13;
The price of health inputs (publicly and privately supplied) and other&#13;
cooperating inputs are the most important controls for the analysis of the&#13;
net effect of education on health.&#13;
One of the major problems that arise from estimating the relationship&#13;
between parental education and child health by cross-national data is that&#13;
in such data sets adult education is highly correlated with the availability&#13;
(and thus the price) of health inputs and other cooperating factois. These&#13;
can be sanitation, pure water, and preventive and curative medicine or&#13;
factors such as physical capital and technology which alter the effect of&#13;
education on income and wages and thus alter the net effect of education.&#13;
In this chapter we shall therefore, attempt to get a better estimate of the&#13;
net effect of education by looking at less aggregate data than the cross-&#13;
national data reviewed in Chapter II. During this empirical investigation,&#13;
we shall also take into account the theoretical issues explored in Chapter III.&#13;
Ideally, we would like to have data on individual families&#13;
which allow us to control for the relevant exogenous variables to estimate&#13;
the net effect of education on child health. Unfortunately, there are&#13;
relatively few data sets which contain measures of both child health and&#13;
parental education. The number of data sets that also include the relevent&#13;
controls is extremely small. We shall therefore first review the individual&#13;
data which allow us to measure the gross relationship between child health&#13;
and parental education at the household level within as broad a range of&#13;
developing countries as possible. We shall then review the multivariate&#13;
studies which allow some control for the relevant exogenous variables.&#13;
After reviewing these two types of data we shall complete the chapter by&#13;
looking at studies of aggregate regions within countries. These studies&#13;
allow us to estimate how aggregate and individual estimates of the net&#13;
effect differ. We shall also review other data which illustrate the way in&#13;
which country characteristics affect the relationship (net or gross)&#13;
between child health and parental education.&#13;
It would be desirable to have as many measures of child health&#13;
as possible to relate to parental education. In designing this project&#13;
we originally proposed to examine measures of nutritional status, morbidity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57-&#13;
and  mortality.  TJnfortlrnately, an extensive search of the literature&#13;
revealed very few studies on child morbidity and parental education.&#13;
Despite the fact that many morbidity studies coollect data on parental&#13;
education, less than five satisfactory studies for developing countries&#13;
could be found which cross-classified parental education and chLld morbidity.&#13;
In the following review we shall therefore restrict our attention to the&#13;
more numerous work on nutritional status and infant/child mortality.&#13;
B. Parental Education and Child Nutritional Status&#13;
Th-'s section of the chapter wiLl bring together evidence from&#13;
field studies in developing countries concerning the relationship between&#13;
parental education and child nutritional status. Virtually no research&#13;
was found that was designed specifically to investigate the role of maternal&#13;
or paternal education as a determinant of child nutritional or disease&#13;
status. A reasonable nunber of studies of socioeconomic determinants of&#13;
child malnutrition did, however, report on maternal or paternal education,&#13;
or both, as one of the socioeconomic variables investigated. It is interesting&#13;
to note that many more studies were found that reported on the association&#13;
between parental education and child nutrition than on the association&#13;
between parental education and child morbidity. Virtually all the invest-&#13;
igations of the determinants of child malnutrition nevertheless consider&#13;
child morbidity (or a specific disease such as diarrhea) as a likely cause,&#13;
and rarely fail to find the anticipated strong association between the two.&#13;
To conduct good research on nutritional status it is necessary&#13;
to have very careful measurement by well-qualified personnel. Such studies&#13;
accordingly tend to be relatively costly per capita and tend generally to&#13;
be very small-scale. In many cases the samples are nonrandom. In reviewing&#13;
the evidence below it is necessary to consider how the results differ&#13;
depending on sample characteristics. We shall first review the studies to&#13;
determine the sign and significance of the relationship between education&#13;
and nutritional status and then see how these differ by sample characteristics.&#13;
Later we shall try to determine the magnitude of educatior.'s effect.&#13;
Table 4-1 summarized the findings of 16 studies that show the&#13;
relationship between parental education and child nutritional status (a&#13;
number of additional studies reported that parental education was one of&#13;
the variables measured, but do not report results of analysis done with&#13;
this measure). The table is divided into four parts: Table 4-LA presents&#13;
six studies from Latin America, Table 4-lB presents three studies from the&#13;
Middle East, Table 4-1C presents five studies from Africa, and Table 4-1D&#13;
presents three studies from Asia.&#13;
Most of the studies presented in Table 4-1 find parental educational&#13;
level to be positively associated with the nutritional status of their&#13;
children. These findings are in contrast to the lack of association between&#13;
parental education and child nutritional status found in more developed&#13;
countries. A five year prospective study of over 3,500 children born in&#13;
Oakland, California, found a strong, positive association between parents'&#13;
years of school and their own heights, but controlling fo-L parental height,&#13;

there was no significant association between parents' years of school and&#13;
the height of their children, either at birth or at five years of age&#13;
(Wingerd and Schoen, 1974). An analysis of the Ten State Nutrition Survey&#13;
similarly reported that, controlling for mother's height, mother's years of&#13;
school showed no significant association with birthweight or with height or&#13;
weight or arm circumference for age (Chernichovsky and Coate, 1979). 1/&#13;
These two U.S. studies also failed to find a significant association&#13;
between family income and any measure of child nutritional status. Both&#13;
studies conclude that, in the population studies, genetic factors are more&#13;
important than socioeconomic factors in determining child growth. This&#13;
difference between the relative importance of genetic and socioeconomic&#13;
determinants of child growth in more developed and less developed countries&#13;
is confirmed in a review of 24 studies of parent/child height correlations,&#13;
which finds that there is a much higher correlation between child height&#13;
and average height of parents in higher income populations than in lower&#13;
income populations (Mueller, 1976).&#13;
The most frequent measure of parental education in the studies&#13;
summarized in Table 4-1 is mother's years of school. Twelve of the seventeen&#13;
studies report results using this measure; of these, seven report a positive&#13;
and significant association between mother's years of school and one or&#13;
more measures of child nutritional status. Five report insignificant&#13;
relationships. Four other studies report on female literacy rather than&#13;
years of schooling and child nutritional status. All four of these studies&#13;
showed nutritional status and maternal literacy to be positively related&#13;
and significant. One study reports on the education of the household head&#13;
and shows a significantly positive relationship. The six studies that&#13;
report paternal education show significantly positive results in only three&#13;
cases.&#13;
To determine how sample size and design affect the results&#13;
we can cross-classify the studies on the basis of the sample size and&#13;
results. Table 4-2A shows studies cross-classified by whether or not the&#13;
sample was random and whether or not the results did or did not show a&#13;
positive significant association between educational and nutritional&#13;
status. Since some studies report more than one measure of nutrition&#13;
and/or more than one measure of education, it is somewhat difficult to&#13;
summarize the results. In Table 4-2A we shall classify a study as positive&#13;
significant if at least one measure of nutrition and one measure of education&#13;
are positive significant and each study will only be reported once. In&#13;
Table 4-2B we shall report on the multiple results in studies and each&#13;
study will be included as many time as there are relationships between&#13;
maternal education and child nutrition.&#13;
Table 4-2 shows quite clearly that three of the insignificant&#13;
results in larger samples need further discussion. The one study with a&#13;
sample size of at least 100 that shows a significantly negative association&#13;
1/ Another national survey in the U.S. showed that the education of head&#13;
of household had a very small, but significant effect on nutritional&#13;
intake of children which in turn had an effect on child nutritional&#13;
status. (Chernichovsky and Coate, 1979).&#13;

-64-&#13;
between educational and nutritional status is that for Transkei Village in&#13;
South Africa (Westcott and Stott, 1977). In this study the children were&#13;
classified on the basis of weight for age as being above or below the&#13;
Boston third percentile. 1/ Half of the mothers of the 42 malnourished&#13;
children had been to school whereas only a third of the mothers of the 77&#13;
well-nourished children had been to school. The authors suggest that part&#13;
of the reason for this unexpected finding is that a greater number of&#13;
educated mothers were unmarried. Also, the sample studied was not a random&#13;
sample but rather included the approximately 80 percent children under five&#13;
whose mothers were willing to come to a clinic or let a nurse visit their&#13;
home. The authors suggest that the mothers who refused to participate may&#13;
have been ashamed to let the nurses see their children and that these may&#13;
have been, in fact, the most seriously malnourished children in the village.&#13;
It seems not unreasonable to conclude, therefore, that uneducated mothers&#13;
of malnourished children were underrepresented in this sample. The authors&#13;
further report that only 66 percent of the children in the sample lived in&#13;
households supported by the father. Of the children who did live in&#13;
households supported by the father, 31 percent were malnourished, whereas&#13;
50 percent of children in families not supported by the father were malnourished.&#13;
Westcott and Stott also considered the influence of household income on&#13;
child malnutrition and found that there was a positive but not statistically&#13;
significant association between higher income and child nutritional status.&#13;
They also found that average household income was lower for the 1households&#13;
not supported by the father.&#13;
In addition to the anomalous case in South Africa, there is&#13;
one other large sanmle that shows no significant relationship between&#13;
mother's years of schooling and child nutritional status. This is the&#13;
Burgess et al. (1973) study of Malawi. In this study the only family&#13;
characteristic which distinguished malnourished from well-nourished children&#13;
was the lack of a father in the family. Since the more educated mothers&#13;
are younger, it may be that in this study, as in the study in the Transkei,&#13;
more educated women were less likely to have the husband present in the&#13;
household if younger men are more likely to be working elsewhere. This,&#13;
however, is a hypothesis that cannot be confirmed from the existing published&#13;
materials.&#13;
The only other study that showed a nonsignificant relationship&#13;
with a sample of 100 or more is the Candelaria study (Wray and Aguirre,&#13;
1969). In this study mother's literacy and child's weight for age were&#13;
significantly positively related, but mother's years of schooling and&#13;
child's weight for age were positively, but not significantly related.&#13;
This suggest that there is possibly a nonlinear relationship involved.&#13;
While the above evidence gives unequivocal support for a positive&#13;
association between maternal education and child nutritional status, it&#13;
1/ A sample of 134 children in Boston was measured at ages 3 months through&#13;
3 years and the height and weight of these children have been used as&#13;
standards for comparison. The third percentile cut-off means that the&#13;
"malnourished" children are smaller than all but the 3 smallest children&#13;
in the Boston sample.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-65-&#13;
is quite difficult to summarize the above studies in such a way to estimate&#13;
the magnitude of the effect. The simplest summary is to compare parental&#13;
education of malnourished and of well-nourished children. This is shown in&#13;
Table 4-3A and 4-3B for the studies where such comparisons are possible&#13;
from the data given in the study.&#13;

aj All of the studies included in this table reported-the proportion of&#13;
illiterate mothers of malnourished children to be sitnificantly greater&#13;
than the proportion of illiterate Dthers of well nourished children.&#13;
b/ See Table 4-1 for measures of nutritional status used.&#13;
Table 4-3A combines observations from the five studies that report&#13;
average years of schooling of parents of malnourished and well nourished ,&#13;
children. Three of these studies report that mothers of malnourished children&#13;
in the sample had significantly less schooling than mothers of well-nourished&#13;
children, and two report that fathers of malnourished children also had signi-&#13;
ficantly less schooling than fathers of well nourished children. The two&#13;
studies that report no significant difference between maternal schooling for the&#13;
two groups both had extremely small sample sizes.&#13;
If anything, the studies in Table 4-3A probably tend to under-&#13;
estimate the educational differentials between parents of malnourished and&#13;
well-nourished children because the comparisons were made between family&#13;
characteristics of a group of malnourished children and a matched control&#13;
group. Although the matching was not done specifically on parental education,&#13;
children were matched on the basis of neighborhood of residence in all the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-67-&#13;
studies and also on the basis of birthweight in the Mexican study (Cravioto&#13;
and DeLicardie, 1975), both methods tend to reduce the difference in years&#13;
of parental schooling between the two groups. The most extreme difference&#13;
in average years of schooling is between the mothers of malnourished and&#13;
well-nourished children in Kathmandu (Graves, 1978). It is important to&#13;
realize that the majority of mothers of both malnourished and well-nourished&#13;
children in Kathmandu had no schooling, but there were nine mothers of&#13;
well-nourished children who had gone to school compared with only two&#13;
mothers of malnourished children.&#13;
When the results of the five studies in Table 4-2 are combined&#13;
(weighted by sample size) we find that mothers of malnourished children&#13;
averaged 2.6 years of school compared with mothers of well-nourished&#13;
children, who ave:aged 3.5 years of school. Fathers of malnourished&#13;
children averaged 3.; years of school, while fathers of well-nourished&#13;
children averaged 4.8 years of school.&#13;
Table 4-3B compares rates of maternal literacy in four of the&#13;
studies summarized in Table 4-1.1/ All of these studies found a significantly&#13;
larger proportion of illiterates among mothers of malnourished children&#13;
than among mothers of well-nourished children. 2/ A weighted average from&#13;
these four studies shows 61 percent of mothers of malnourished children to&#13;
be illiterate compared with 49 percent of mothers of well-nourished children.&#13;
The study from Lebanon (Kanawati and McLaren, 1973) also found a significantly&#13;
higher rate of paternal illiteracy for malnourished children.&#13;
It is also possible in a few cases to compare the child nutritional&#13;
level of offspring of mothers of different educational groups. For two of&#13;
the studies reported in Table 4-3B it was possible to compare the percentage&#13;
of malnourished children for literate and illiterate mothers. In Candelaria,&#13;
Colombia, Wray and Aguirre (1969) found that 48-percent of children of&#13;
illiterate mothers were malnourished (less than 85 percent weight for age)&#13;
while 37 percent of children of literate mothers were malnourished. In&#13;
Punjab, India, Levinson (1974) found that 88 percent of children of illiterate&#13;
mothers were below 90 percent of weight for age and 51 percent of these&#13;
1/ Two other studies in Table 4-1, Gans (1963) and Christiansen et al.&#13;
(1974) also reported a significant positive association between maternal&#13;
literacy and child nutritional status, but did not report their data&#13;
in a way that could be included in Table 4-3B. The only study that&#13;
examined the effect of literacy and failed to find a significant&#13;
association with child nutritional status was Cravioto and DeLicardie's&#13;
small sample in Mexico. The finding of no significant association is&#13;
not really surprising since only two mothers of malnourished children&#13;
and three mothers of the control children were illiterate.&#13;
2/ A small study in St. Lucia in the West Indies found that there was an&#13;
overall maternal illiteracy rate of 69 percent in families with a&#13;
malnourished child, but there was a maternal illiteracy rate of 87&#13;
percent in families who had a currently malnourished child and who also&#13;
had previously had one or more children die under two years of age&#13;
(Lees et al., 1966).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-68-&#13;
children were leos than 75 percent of weight for age (the comparable&#13;
percentages for children of literate mothers were 77 and 42).&#13;
The only study comparing nutritional status by years of maternal&#13;
education is that done by Al-tsi, Kanawati and McLaren (1975) in a low&#13;
socioeconomic community on the outskirts of Beirut, Lebanon.  These results&#13;
are shown in Table 4-4, but they underestimate the net effect of education&#13;
if education operates at least in part through higher incomes. In this&#13;
study subsamples of mothers of preschool children from four different&#13;
educational groups (ranging from those with no schooling to those with 7-9&#13;
years of schooling) were matched on the basis of their age, their husband's&#13;
age, their husbands' years of schooling, the number of children in the&#13;
family and the family income. Table 4-4 compares the nutritional status of&#13;
the children of the mothers in the different education groups. On the&#13;
basis of both weight for age and height for age the nutritional status of&#13;
children whose mothers had 7-9 years of school was better than the nutritional&#13;
status of children whose mothers had no schooling or only 1-3 years of&#13;
schooling. On the basis of the somatic quotient measure (the average of&#13;
the means of weight, height, head circumference, all expressed as percentages&#13;
of the standard), the children of mothers with 7-9 years of school were&#13;
significantly better nourished than the children in each of the other three&#13;
groups.&#13;
The evidence reviewed above gives fairly conclusive proof of a&#13;
positive relationship between maternal education and child nutritional&#13;
status, but the magnitude of the effect of education is underestimated&#13;
if nutritional status is affected by education through any of those&#13;
variables which were used as controls in the matched samples. The effect&#13;
is overestimated to the extent that other variables are excluded which&#13;
affect nutrition, for example, food prices and access to pure water, and&#13;
these factors are correlated with, but not consequences of, education.&#13;
Given that food prices and access to pure water are highly dependent on&#13;
geographical area, the extent of overestimation depends on (1) how geographi-&#13;
cally dispersed the sample is and (2) how closely correlated area educational&#13;
levels are with access and prices. 1/.&#13;
The relative importance of the various factors contributing to&#13;
over- and underestimation are difficult to access. In most instances,&#13;
however, samples covered narrow geographical areas or were matched by&#13;
neighborhood. Only for the two Malawi studies cited (covering, respectively&#13;
Namitambo and Lower Shire Valley) and the Punjab study by Levinson, is it&#13;
obvious that ten or more geographical areas were included. In the other&#13;
cases the samples were either geographically narrow, matched or nonrandom.&#13;
It is very difficult to determine on a priori grounds whether the nonrandom&#13;
1/ If educational level is positively correlated with access to pure&#13;
water the education effect is overestimated, but if education is&#13;
positively related to food prices (which are likely to be higher-in&#13;
urban than rural areas), then education's effect is underestimated.&#13;

samples would tend to result in upward or downward bias in the results.&#13;
Those samples which were clinic based probably over-sample the educated&#13;
women in the commuxnity, but whether that leads to an over- or underestimate&#13;
of education's effect on nutritional status is unclear. Given the narrow&#13;
range and matching of samples it thus seems likely that, if anything, these&#13;
results underestimate the gross effect of education through all channels.&#13;
Multivariate studies of the determinants of nutritional status&#13;
give some insight into the relative importance of different channels&#13;
through which education may have an effect, but, unfortunately, there are&#13;
relatively few studies of this type.&#13;
There are several multivariate studies of nutrition. None of&#13;
them has been specifically designed to study education's effect on nutritional&#13;
stutus. They do not, therefore, structure their equations as suggested in&#13;
Chapter III. 1/ Despite these shortcomings it is useful to examine these&#13;
results. There are four studies; we shall review two for the Philippines&#13;
and two for Colombia.&#13;
The two Philippines samples differ substantially in methodology,&#13;
sample size, model specification and measurement. The first study was&#13;
designed to study a vitamin A intervention experiment in Cebu Island of&#13;
the Philippines using a sample of 1,715 children 1-16 years of age (Solon&#13;
et al., 1979). Multivariate analysis of the serum A level at the end of&#13;
the study included as explanatory variables mothers' education, household&#13;
income per capita, change in income 1973-75, initial level of serum A in&#13;
1973, and two treatment variables. Very little of the variation in serum A&#13;
was explained by these regression (four percent) and only the initial level&#13;
of serum A and MSG supplementation showed a significant relationship with&#13;
terminal serum A levels. This finding does not conclusively prove that&#13;
education and income had no effect on serum A, because they may well have&#13;
affected terminal levels through initial levels.&#13;
Another study in Laguna, Philippines, showed both maternal&#13;
education and income were significantly related to the weight of preschool&#13;
children compared to the standard weight per age and sex (Evenson et al.,&#13;
1979)   In the equations in Table 4-5 mothers' education has a higher t&#13;
value than does income in all cases except those involving children 48-83&#13;
months. But the estimates of education's effect are undoubtedly under-&#13;
estimated due to the inclusion of income and wealth in the equation.&#13;
Education might also act through number of children under six. The Laguna&#13;
study thus shows significantly positive relationship between education and&#13;
child nutrition as measured by standardized weight for age, but the Cebu&#13;
Island study shows no significance for serum levels of vitamin A.&#13;
1/ In addition, a number of interesting multivariate studies of nutrition&#13;
do not include education, much less in the optimal specification&#13;
(Hammer, 1978 and Levinson, 1974).&#13;

The two Colombian studies also show diverse results -- probably&#13;
because of the inclusion of different explanatory variables, some of which&#13;
undoubtedly are endogenous with respect to education. The small Cali&#13;
sample of 127 children found that mothers' education was not significantly&#13;
related to standardized weight for age, but this equation included a large&#13;
number of variables through which education may operate, thus diminishing&#13;
the observed effect of education per se (Franklin, 1979). The most&#13;
inportant of these (all of which were statistically significant) were&#13;
measures of health practices such as boiling water, following recommended&#13;
procedures for treatment of diarrhea, and the vaccination of children for&#13;
measles. The number of children under six and breastfeeding behavior were&#13;
also included, clouding the effect of education. All of these were signi-&#13;
ficant, but some acted in such a way as to increase the child nutritional&#13;
level and some to reduce it. It therefore is unclear whether education's&#13;
effect would be under- or overestimated by the inclusion of these variables.&#13;
The author of this study hypothesizes a curvilinear relationship between&#13;
education and child nutrition and claims to have documented it, but since&#13;
93 percent of the 127 mothers had education of less than primary school&#13;
level, it is unclear how significant his findings are since neither the&#13;
number or standard deviation in each education group are reported.&#13;
The second study in Colombia is the Heller and Drake (1979)&#13;
study of 1,200 children in Candelaria, Colombia. 1/ The results of this&#13;
study varied depending on what measure of nutritional status was used.&#13;
Mothers' education was positively significantly related to weight for&#13;
height, negatively significantly related to height for age and unrelated to&#13;
weight for age. But again, this analysis includes endogenous variables&#13;
which confuse the interpretation of the results. In particular, as in the&#13;
serum A study, this analysis includes lagged values of the nutrition levels&#13;
which are very significant. Of the other variables in the equation,&#13;
husbands' education, birth order and number of children under six are&#13;
probably the most closely related to education and, therefore, probably&#13;
dilute education's effect considerably. While Heller and Drake recognize&#13;
the simultaneous problems involved in parental decisionmaking with respect&#13;
to many variables, the effect of education is difficult to trace.&#13;
While these multivariate studies give some indication of what&#13;
variables are important for child nutrition they are neither structural nor&#13;
reduced form equations, and thus cannot give clear insight into the effect&#13;
of parental education on child nutrition. In addition, the specifications&#13;
with lagged values of the nutritional level give the lowest education&#13;
effects. This finding would be expected if in fact education does affect&#13;
nutrition.&#13;
1/ This study, as well as that in Cali, seem to involve clinic-based&#13;
samples. This circumstance probably introduces bias in the sample&#13;
and uncertain bias in the coefficients.&#13;

C. Parental Education and Child Mortality:&#13;
The Micro Evidence&#13;
A considerable amount of research is now underway on the socio-&#13;
economic determinants of mortality in developing countries, as evidenced by&#13;
the Mexico City conference in the summer of 1979. We shall now review two&#13;
kinds of evidence on the relationship between child mortality and parental&#13;
education. First, we shall examine the evidence from a broad range of&#13;
surveys in developing countries which cross-tabulate child survival by&#13;
mother's level of education. This allows us to estimate the gross relation-&#13;
ship. There is evidence of this kind from 33 developing countries.&#13;
Secondly, we shall look at the much smaller number of studies which use&#13;
micro data in the multivariate analysis of child mortality.&#13;
1. Bivariate Relationship between Parental Education and Child Mortality&#13;
There are three ways of estimating child mortality. The first is&#13;
to calculate the proportion of children surviving to mothers of different&#13;
educational levels. To be meaningful, these data should be calculated&#13;
separately for women of different age groups to control for the period of&#13;
exposure to death (that is, older women have older children which have had&#13;
a longer period in which to risk dying) and for the fact that mortality has&#13;
been changing over time. A second method is to use indirect estimates of&#13;
child mortality which allow one to calculate the probability that a child&#13;
will die by a given age, say age two. This controls for the child age&#13;
effect, but not the effect of changes in mortality over time. The third&#13;
method is to look at detailed birth histories and calculate the proportion&#13;
of children who die by age one, two, five, etc.   This last technique&#13;
requires that the women report the timing of past events very accurately,&#13;
and is therefore not a useful technique for many samples. The evidence on&#13;
the indirect estimation will be reviewed first, and then the other kinds of&#13;
evidence.&#13;
Figure 4-1 illustrates the relationship between mothers' education&#13;
and the probability of dying by age two for the Latin American and non-Latin&#13;
American countries. The relationship is boringly inverse, but there are&#13;
some differences in slope for the relationship and there is a suggestion of&#13;
convergence in mortality levels among the most educated. This hypothesis&#13;
has been set forth by a number of researchers.&#13;
Combining the data for the seventeen countries shown in Figure&#13;
4-1, the relationship between years of schooling and mortality was found to&#13;
be linear with a slope of 9 per 1,000 (see Table 4-6). Alternative log&#13;
specifications did not improve the fit and quadratic specifications showed&#13;
the square of education to be insignificant. In all cases but two, despite&#13;
the small number of data points of each country, the coefficient of education&#13;
was statistically significant.&#13;

As a firs-t approximation, therefore, the extent of educational&#13;
differentials can be quantified as the slope of the linear regression line&#13;
between years of schooling and child mortality using these data. These&#13;
regression equations are shown in Table 4-6. The slopes do show a substantial&#13;
variation from .003, which is not significant, to .012 in Bolivia. (In a&#13;
number of individual countries, the quadratic term was significant and is&#13;
shown in these individual cases. But no use was made of these alternative&#13;
specifications.)&#13;
It is difficult to judge to what extent these are over- or&#13;
underestimates of the net effect of education. They are overestimates if&#13;
education is positively correlated with access to health care. The most&#13;
obvious way such a correlation could arise is because more educated women&#13;
are more likely to live in urban areas. This possibility can be tested for&#13;
a subset of eight Latin American countries for which data are available&#13;
separately for urban and rural areas. The results of those regressions are&#13;
surprisingly consistent with the national estimates obtained above. The&#13;
regression equation for urban areas i2 q2 a.146-.0096 Y (R2 =.59) and for&#13;
rural areas it is q2 -.158-.0094 Y (R -.51). The intercept is larger in&#13;
rural areas, reflecting the overall higher mortality there resulting in&#13;
part from less access to health facilities, but the slopes are remarkably&#13;
close for the two areas indicating that for this subsample the education's&#13;
effect is not overestimated due to the differential price of health in&#13;
urban and rural areas.&#13;
To expand the number of countries involved, another set of&#13;
countries with somewhat different measures of child mortality will be&#13;
examined. The data in this case were the proportion of children dying by&#13;
age of mother and mother's education. Table 4-7 summarizes the regression&#13;
equation estimating the relationships. In this case given how many observ-&#13;
ations exist only significant regressions are reported.&#13;
Two sets of regressions were done for the pooled data. First,&#13;
all countries were included for each age group. These results were remarkably&#13;
consistent with earlier results, particularly for women aged 30-34, where&#13;
the slope was again 9 per 1,000. The slope increased with the age of the&#13;
mother (as did the intercept), indicating that both mortality and education's&#13;
effect on mortality rise over the life cycle. The second set of calculations&#13;
inluded only those data points which showed significant slopes. The&#13;
regressions are even more consistent with the 9 per 1,000 slope observed in&#13;
the first data set.&#13;
The bivariate analysis is, therefore, remarkably uniform in the&#13;
relationship observed between maternal education and child mortality.&#13;
Regardless of measurement technique, it appears that an additional year of&#13;
schooling reduces mortality for infants and children by 9 per 1,000. This&#13;
is no evidence that this effect differs by urban and rural area, but there&#13;
is evidence that it is is cumulative and becomes stronger as a woman&#13;
ages.&#13;

The consistency of these results is rather remarkable considering&#13;
the wide range of environments. To further explore education's relationship&#13;
to child health we shall first examine the multivariate studies to determine&#13;
how much maternal education is capturing the effect of other highly correlated&#13;
variables. The second extension of this analysis will be reported in the&#13;
last section of this chapter where we explore what factors are related to&#13;
variations between countries in the bivariate relationship between child&#13;
survival and maternal education.&#13;
2. Multivariate Studies&#13;
There are approximately seven micro studies which allow some&#13;
estimate and comparison of the relationship between parental education and&#13;
child mortality controlling for other factors (endogenous and exogenous).&#13;
These are summarized in Table 4-8. These studies are difficult to evaluate&#13;
in terms of whether they under- or overestimate the net effect of education,&#13;
but Table 4-8 explains what other variables are included in the analysis.&#13;
Since most studies include several specification, we have chosen to include&#13;
those that have the fewest endogenous variables.&#13;
There are 17 measures of education in these studies of which&#13;
13 are significant. For maternal education there are 10 measures of which&#13;
7 are significant and for males 4 out of 7 are significant. The insigni-&#13;
ficant coefficients can plausibly be accounted for by defects of equation&#13;
specification (Behrman and Wolfe, too many inappropriate controls; Khan,&#13;
child deaths rather than death rates) or sample selection (Knowles, restric-&#13;
tions to a low income area and inclusion of income in the equation). To&#13;
clarify the problems of these studies, they are briefly summarized below.&#13;
In an analysis of data for 1,294 women from a 1977 survey of&#13;
Managua, Nicaragua, Behrman and Wolfe (1979) construct a complicated model&#13;
aimed at examining in detail the ways in which the health and nutrition of&#13;
women affects their fertility. Infant mortality (and, indeed, spontaneous&#13;
and induced abortion) is included in their deliberately eclectic system of&#13;
equations. In their equation (7) 1/ an additional year of mother's&#13;
education (mean=4.9), reduces infant mortality by 4/1,000 (on an apparent&#13;
base of 78/1,000), but the t- ratio is only 1.2. The equation contains such&#13;
a wide range of other endogenous variables potentially affected by education&#13;
that coefficient on education must mainly capture residual effects, and it&#13;
is not surprising that the coefficient is insignificant.&#13;
In 1976-77 Knowles (1979) surveyed a low income area of Karachi.&#13;
The restriction to a low-income area is unfortunate for present purposes,&#13;
since the more educated people found there are probably atypical of people&#13;
with that education in the population as a whole. Their education has not&#13;
obtained for them a substantially improved residential environment, and&#13;
many of the other usual consequences of education, including health effects,&#13;

may be absent as well. The dependent variable is the proportion of a&#13;
family's children surviving to age three or to the survey data, whichever&#13;
occurs first (thus, children less than age three at the time of the survey&#13;
are included in both births and survivors). Education measures are husband&#13;
literate (LITH), wife literate but has not completed secondary school&#13;
(LITW), and wife has completed secondary school (SECW). (Sample means are:&#13;
proportion surviving, .878; LITH, .57; LITW, .14; SECW, .05.1/)&#13;
The best regression for our purposes is Knowles' second equation&#13;
which omits endogenous input variables such as breastfeeding 2/ and&#13;
sanitation practices. (Controls for exogenous private input prices and&#13;
public input quantities are not needed since this sample is from a single&#13;
locality.) Equation (2) is superior to (1) because it omits women who have&#13;
not yet completed nursing even one child; for these women the child survival&#13;
measure is likely to be a poor approximation to the actual probability of&#13;
survival to age three. The log of income per adult household member is&#13;
highly significant; doubling income from the sample mean would raise the&#13;
survival probability by about .04. The education variables are not signifi-&#13;
cant, but to the extent that education acts through income, education's&#13;
effect is underestimated.&#13;
M. Ali Khan (1978) analyzes data from a 1968-69 survey of women&#13;
in what are now Bangladesh and Pakistan. He uses a thoughtfully constructed,&#13;
theoretically based model aimed at explaining completed fertility among&#13;
rural women aged 35-39 who said that they wanted no more children. The&#13;
model includes an equation for the number of child deaths per women rather&#13;
than for the death rate. This makes calculation of the effect of education&#13;
on death rates very difficult and highly speculative.&#13;
For the Bangladesh sample (215 women), wife's literacy (EF)&#13;
reduces the number of child deaths by .15 and increases the number of&#13;
births by .42 in two-stage least-squares estimates of the structural&#13;
equations. To approximate the total, or reduced-form, effect of wife's&#13;
literacy, the first iteration of feedback effects in the simultaneous&#13;
system was traced out, using only significant coefficients. The larger&#13;
number of births due to wife's literacy increases deaths by .06 (-.42 x&#13;
.14) and the other effects reduce deaths very slightly, so the net effect&#13;
of wife's literacy is to reduce deaths by about .10 (.15 - .06 + e).&#13;
1/ Appendix A, p. 36.&#13;
2/ If breastfeeding is included, education coefficient is increased&#13;
substantially because education acts to reduce breastfeeding with&#13;
deleterious effects on mortality. If only wife's education is included,&#13;
secondary education appears to raise the child-survival probability by&#13;
.10 (pp. 7-8); this attributes to the wife's education not only its own&#13;
effects (.04 in equation (2) assuming the wife produces no market&#13;
income), but also the effects of correlated husband's education and&#13;
income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

A fortiori, the death rate is also reduced, but no sample means for births&#13;
and child deaths are given and one can only guess as to the magnitude of&#13;
the death rate effect.&#13;
Note that the structural model includes husband's education&#13;
(EM, measured in years), which is only significant in the income equation,&#13;
and a measure of the time (T) that it takes the wife to travel to a "medical&#13;
place," which is insignificant in the child deaths equation. Tracing&#13;
the effects of husband's education through the system sugests that it has,&#13;
at most, a modest effect on the death rate. Thus, for this sample, wife's&#13;
education appears to be more important than husband's for the child death&#13;
rate, and its primary effect is through nonmarket channels, not through&#13;
income.&#13;
For the Pakistani sample (145 women), the results are less&#13;
satisfactory (see Table 4-8.)   Neither wife's nor husband's education is&#13;
significant in the child death equation, and travel time to a "medical&#13;
place" significantly decreases deaths. Moreover, both education variables&#13;
reduce the number of births significantly and substantially, and number of&#13;
births has no significant effect on number of deaths. This leads to the&#13;
uncomfortable conclusion that education increases the death rate. 2/&#13;
The magnitude of the education coefficients are difficult to&#13;
compare directly, given the various measurements of child mortality included&#13;
in the studies. All coefficients were, therefore, converted into corre-&#13;
sponding infant mortality rates using appropriate life tables, and education&#13;
was converted into a literacy variable using three years of schooling as the&#13;
equivalent to literacy. Using this method of comparison, we find that the&#13;
average of the significant coefficients for wife's education to be -.18&#13;
(.19). The average of all coefficients, valuing insignificant values at&#13;
zero, is -.13. For husband's education the coefficients are much lower -.08&#13;
for significant coefficients and -.045 for all coefficients. Husband's&#13;
education thus has, on the average, less than the effect of wife's education.&#13;
It is also obvious from Table 4-8 that in the individual studies, in all&#13;
cases except urban Colombia, husband's education has half (or less) of the&#13;
effect of wife's education. It is, however, difficult to separate out the&#13;
extent to which either the effect of husband's education or wife's education&#13;
is under- or overestimated or the extent to which education acts through&#13;
market or nonmarket channels.&#13;
1/ For example, if the average illiterate women in the sample had seven&#13;
births and two child deaths for a death rate of 286/1,000, the average&#13;
literate women would have a child death rate of 1.9/7.42 or 256/1,000,&#13;
a difference of 30/1,000.&#13;
2/ Wife's literacy and two years of husband's education each reduce births&#13;
by about 1.2; in the previouo exampli, eaTh would increase t'e child&#13;
death rate from 286/1,000 (=2/7) to 344/1,000 (=2/5.8); 'loth togett2r&#13;
would raise it to 434/l.000 (=2/4.6).&#13;
&#13;

T. P. Schultz's paper (1979) gives the most complete attempt to&#13;
separate out the market versus the nonmarket effect using a model similar&#13;
to that outlined in Chapter III. He reports preliminary results from an&#13;
analysis of household data from the 1973 Colombia census. The sample is&#13;
restricted to couples with at least one child, reporting husband's and&#13;
wife's education and husband's income; the analysis is stratified by&#13;
urban/rural residence and by wife's five-year age group. The mortality&#13;
measure is "child mortality" or children dead divided by children ever born,&#13;
and education is measured in years. For the urban sample, wife's education&#13;
has a larger effect than the husband's in the youngest two age groups. For&#13;
the rural sample, wife's education is not always significant even at the 5&#13;
percent level, and the elasticities are systematically lower than for the&#13;
urban sample.&#13;
To determine how much of education's effect is an income effect,&#13;
monthly income is added to the regression equation and Schultz finds&#13;
that census-month husband's income is almost always insignificant when&#13;
added to these equations, and has little effect on the education coeffi-&#13;
cients. Suspecting that one month's income may be a poor measure of permanent&#13;
income, he estimates equations explaining the log of monthly income by&#13;
education, experience (age-education) and experience squared, and by&#13;
dummy variables representing place of residence (23 departments for males;&#13;
4 or 5 regions for females). These equations are then used to impute&#13;
"permanent" incomes to each individual, and these imputed incomes are&#13;
included along with education in equations explaining child mortality. In&#13;
rural areas, the wife's income is usually significant and the husband's&#13;
not, while for education the situation is reversed -- only husband's&#13;
education is consistently significant. In urban areas,-husband's income&#13;
and education are only occasionally significant, while wife's income and&#13;
education are usually highly significant. The coefficient on schooling is,&#13;
however, with one exception, positive. Schultz interprets this finding as&#13;
follows: wife's education increases the wife's income, which reduces child&#13;
mortality, but also increases the wife's time outside the home, which&#13;
increases child mortality (in this case, the increase is enough to offset&#13;
about half the reduction due to higher income), but the overall net effect&#13;
of education is still negative. The possibility of this result is recognized&#13;
in the theoretical structure outlined in Chapter III, but it rarely seems&#13;
to arise with this strength and consistency in the other empirical work&#13;
reviewed. One possibility is that the dummy variables for place of residence,&#13;
which play a large part in imputed income, are in fact picking up not only&#13;
geographical variation in labor markets, as Schultz intends, but also&#13;
variation in public health services, sanitation, and the like. It will be&#13;
interesting to see if the present results are maintained when actual data&#13;
on these factors are added rather than indirect estimates.&#13;

D. Aggregate Relationships&#13;
Study of the effects of parental education on child health at the&#13;
household level must be the starting point for understanding how education might&#13;
operate to reduce mortality. Clearly, however, we have only begun to quanitfy&#13;
the relationship and have not yet been able to find factors that might explain&#13;
either the consistency of results or their variation. Given the scarcity of&#13;
existing household studies, there is a real temptation to generalize about&#13;
education's effect from more generally available aggregate studies, such as the&#13;
cross-national studies reviewed in Chapter II.&#13;
The use of such aggregate studies is perilous (as explained in Chapter&#13;
III) because in aggregate data parental education is probably highly correlated&#13;
with other factors which improve health and reduce mortality. In an attempt&#13;
to both utilize aggregate data and determine the possible biases that may be&#13;
introduced by doing so, it is useful to review those aggregate studies that&#13;
have been done using subnational units of observation (states, municipalities,&#13;
etc.). These studies can then be compared to see if (1) there exist systematic&#13;
differences in education's effect in different aggregate circumstances and (2)&#13;
if these aggregate estimates appear to be greater or less than the estimates&#13;
reviewed from household data. Since there are systematic differences we shall&#13;
then try to determine using other data if there are aggregate characteristics -&#13;
which can be associated with different individual effects of education on&#13;
mortality.&#13;
E. Analysis and Discussion of Aggregate Results&#13;
Table 4-9 collects results from the aggregate-level studies. Control&#13;
variables are listed, along with significance levels, and an attempt is made to&#13;
sort the control variables into the theoretical categoriees developed in Chapter&#13;
III. 1/ There is a degree of arbitrariness here, but the process is still useful&#13;
and it serves to highlight the differences in approach across studies.&#13;
There is no column in the table for prices of privately purchased&#13;
inputs because no study included such a variable; the "percent urban" variable,&#13;
listed under quantity of publicly-supplied inputs, may capture some effects of&#13;
differences in purchased input prices, however. Among publicly-supplied inputs,&#13;
medical inputs receive the most attention, with occasional treatment of sanitation.&#13;
While the pattern of significance is mixed, the regressions provide some support&#13;
for the effectiveness of such inputs in reducing mortality.&#13;
The "endogenous" controls (rarely recognized as endogenous in the&#13;
authors' statistical methodology) are those whose values are presumably influenced&#13;
by education, either through education's effect on income or through its effect&#13;
on household productivity. Hence, as argued in Chapter III, they are "inappropriate"&#13;
1/   Three of Sloan's data sets are omitted from the table:  two fc, EPuerto Rico&#13;
(1950 and 1960) in which misrecording of births and deaths by place of&#13;
residence could be demonstrated, and one for Bangladesh (1961). where data&#13;
quality was suspect.  None had significant effects for literacy ior much else).&#13;

-85-&#13;
as controls in an analysis aimed at estimating the effect of education. 1/&#13;
Prime "inappropriate" controls are quantities (and qualities) of purchased&#13;
inputs: food, housing and medical care. Also included are birth rates (or the&#13;
presence of older children) and female labor force participation. These variables&#13;
are often statistically insignificant, which may be partly due to the fact that&#13;
they are often crude proxies for the theoretically appropriate variables. Even&#13;
when insignificant, however, their inclusion may capture part of education's&#13;
effect on mortality and thereby reduce the estimated coefficient on education.&#13;
(For this reason, where authors report several specifications, the table usually&#13;
reports the one with the fewest inappropriate controls.)&#13;
Turning finally to the education measure itself, note that, except&#13;
for Anker and Knowles' study (1977) of Kenya, the variable refers only to females.&#13;
Since no measure of male education is included, and since male and female&#13;
education are presumably highly correlated in aggregate level data, the coefficient&#13;
on female education must be interpreted as capturing the effects of both male&#13;
and female education. The education measure is statistically significant, with&#13;
the expected sign, in 10 of the 14 data sets tabulated, which far exceeds the&#13;
performance of any other variable in the table. 2/ Also, the four insignificant&#13;
results are each paired with significant effects for the same time period and&#13;
country; in Mexico (1950-1960) education significantly affects child mortaltiy&#13;
but not infant mortality; in West Malaysia (1947-70 and 1970) the pattern is&#13;
reversed. No explanation for this pairing of significant and insignificant&#13;
results suggests itself.&#13;
Table 4-10 provides approximately commensurable coefficients for the&#13;
effect of education on infant mortality and child mortality for the studies in&#13;
Table 4-9. Differences in the precise age-sex definition of literacy are simply&#13;
ignored, and mortality measures have been converted to common units as recorded&#13;
in the comments column. The coefficients measure the effects of a one percentage&#13;
point increase in literacy on the mortality rate of 1,000.&#13;
For infant mortalty, the results of Table 4-9 are graphed in the upper&#13;
panel of Figure 4-2. All of the significant results are of plausible magnitude,&#13;
but the pattern is not particularly tight. It would be somewhat better if the&#13;
Chile result were adjusted to remove stillbirths; this would reduce the infant&#13;
mortality rate from 102 to about 90 (the 1967 value from Keyfitz and Aieger,&#13;
1971), but there is no way of knowing how this would affect the slope. The average&#13;
1/ If this endogeneity is recognizd, a system of structural equations can be&#13;
estimated that will incorporate education's effect on these variables.&#13;
Given the entire system, the reduced form (or total) effect of education on&#13;
mortality can be calculated. Among the "inappropriate" controls in the&#13;
table, only the crude birth rates in Heller's work are, however, treated in&#13;
this fashion.&#13;
2/ The significance level is 1% for six cases, and at least 5% for the three&#13;
Livingstone-Balbontin data sets (this author reports only whether the signi-&#13;
ficance level is at least 5%).&#13;

-88-&#13;
of the five significant coefficients is -.55; if the two insignificant results&#13;
are entered as zeros, the average drops to -.40. Thus, an extra one percentage&#13;
point of literacy is-estimated to reduce infant mortality by about one-half&#13;
death per thousand; a change from zero to complete literacy would reduce infant&#13;
mortality by 55 to 40 per thousand.&#13;
There is of course no reason that the coefficient should be constant&#13;
over the whole range. Indeed Figure 4-2 suggests a tendency for the slope to&#13;
be flatter at higher literacy rates and lower infant mortality rates, as would&#13;
be the case if there were diminishing returns to literacy. An alternative&#13;
explanation for this result is that the steepest slopes come from equations&#13;
which include the fewest inappropriate controls. Since these equations also&#13;
exclude some relevant controls, their coefficients presumably overestimate the&#13;
actual effect of literacy on mortality. In the other equations, the absence of&#13;
some relevant controls is offset to some unknown degree by the inclusion of&#13;
irrelevant controls, so it is not possible to say whether they over- or under-&#13;
estimate the actual effect of literacy on infant mortaltiy.&#13;
The lower panel of Figure 4-2 graphs the corresponding levels and&#13;
slope coefficients for child mortality. Here the pattern is somewhat tighter&#13;
and the slopes generally flatter (note the change in vertical scale). The&#13;
average of significant coefficients is -.25 and the average (taking insignificant&#13;
results as zero) is -.18, roughly half the values for infant mortality. The&#13;
flatter slopes are perhaps to be expected since the level of child mortality is&#13;
lower than that of infant mortality. Note, however, that the reduction in&#13;
child mortality will apply for each of four years of age, so that the number&#13;
of deaths avoided by a .25 decline in the child mortality rate is about 1 per&#13;
thousand children born, twice that achieved by a .5 reduction in the infant&#13;
mortality rate. 1/ For child mortality, there is no suggestion of diminishing&#13;
returns nor are the steepest slopes from equations with the fewest inappropriate&#13;
controls. Again, it is impossible to say whether the estimated coefficients&#13;
are more affected by the exclusion of relevant controls or the inclusion of&#13;
inappropriate controls.&#13;
For subsequent discussion, the averages treating insignificant&#13;
results as zero are taken as the best estimate of the actual effect of literacy&#13;
on infant and child mortality: -.40 and -.18, respectively.&#13;
Comparison shows that the micro coefficients are generally smaller&#13;
than the aggregate coefficients. The average of significant coefficients for&#13;
wife's education is -.18; adding 50 percent for husband's educaton would give&#13;
-.27. 2/ This finding compares with average coefficients of -.55 (only&#13;
significant) or -.40 (insignificant treated as zero) for aggregate data.&#13;
1/ Further, the loss to family and to society occasioned by the death of&#13;
a child is presumably greater the older the child, so that avoiding a&#13;
child death should have greater weight than avoiding an infant death.&#13;
2/ Exactly the same figure is obtained by averaging the sums of significant&#13;
wife's or husband's coefficients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-89-&#13;
This in turn suggests that in the aggregate data, the coefficients of female&#13;
literacy capture not only male literacy but substantial effects from omitted&#13;
relevant controls as well. The correlation between household education and&#13;
omitted controls is, as argued in Chapter III, usually smaller than between&#13;
aggregate education and omitted controls. Hence, the smaller micro-level&#13;
coefficients are probably a more accurate estimate of the cetris paribus&#13;
effects of increased education on infant and child mortality.&#13;
The above analysis shows that aggregate estimates of the relation-&#13;
ship between maternal education and child mortality differ from micro level&#13;
estimates. This finding could result from correlations between aggregate&#13;
education and omitted vaiables which affect infant and child mortality. It&#13;
is also possible that aggregate characteristics in and of themselves interact&#13;
with education in determining child health. If this is the case, then the&#13;
relationship between child mortality and maternal education at the micro level&#13;
would show systematic variation with aggregate characteristics of a country.&#13;
To test out this possibility one can use the slopes of the regression&#13;
equations in Tables 4-6 and 4-7 as dependent variables and study their variation.&#13;
Table 4-11 shows the results of using stepwise regressions with life expectancy,&#13;
the log of per capita income, the time period and the illiteracy rate to explain&#13;
educational differentials as measured by the absolute value of the slope from&#13;
the equations in Table 4-6. In each case, the regression with the highest&#13;
adjusted R was selected. This result is shown in item l(a) in Table 4-11. In&#13;
that case only the illiteracy rate is insignificant, and shows that the higher&#13;
the illiteracy rate in the country, the greater the advantage of education.&#13;
While life expectancy entered the equation, it was not significant. The&#13;
relationship between illiteracy and the effect of education may reflect the&#13;
fact that illiteracy is closely related to mortality levels and the higher&#13;
these levels the greater the impact of education. If so, life expectancy is&#13;
not picking this up.&#13;
An alternative specification to test this hypothesis is to include&#13;
the level of mortality of the least educated. To do this we used the intercept&#13;
of the regression equations shown in Table 4-6. When that is entered, illiteracy&#13;
is no longer significant, as shown in item l(b) in the table, and the higher the&#13;
intercept mortality the greater the educational differentials as measured by&#13;
the slope.&#13;
A question that arises in examining educational differentials is how&#13;
differentials may be reduced other than by simply reducing overall mortality.&#13;
To determine if such differentials are sensitive to government per capita&#13;
expenditures on health, data for such expenditures were entered into the&#13;
stepwise regression with the results shown in items 2(a) and 2(b) in the&#13;
table.  In both cases, increases in government health expenditure per capita&#13;
have a substantial impact in reducing educational differentials. If the&#13;
mortality level of the uneducated, A, is entered in the equation, the direct&#13;
relationship between such expenditures and educational differentials is&#13;
reduced by half. The logical inference is that this reduction in tTe coeffi-&#13;
cient results from the indirect effect of such expenditures oni A, but the&#13;
analysis of the determinants of the intercept value has not been done.&#13;

These results are unsurprising and intuitively appealing, but&#13;
given the small number of countries involved and the imprecise measurements&#13;
used, one wonders how robust the results are. In particular, the failure of&#13;
life expectancy-per se or illiteracy rates or income to affect the differentials&#13;
is somewhat surprising.&#13;
The analysis can be expanded by repeating the analysis for the&#13;
countries included in Table 4-7. The results of this analysis are shown in&#13;
items 3 and 4 of Table 4-11. Only the results for women aged 30-34 are&#13;
reported, because those for younger women were not generally significant. For&#13;
women aged 30-34 the regressions restricted to the smaller sample of significant&#13;
slopes show greater explanatory power. Therefore, the results in items 3 and 4&#13;
report two sets of regressions. Those with the restricted sample are shown in&#13;
brackets.&#13;
The results for the proportion of children dying for women aged 30-34&#13;
are not very interesting when the entire sample is used. In all cases the only&#13;
significant variable is either life expectancy or the intercept from Table&#13;
4-7. The interpretations of these results are always the same, i.e., the&#13;
higher the mortality (the lower the life expectancy) the greater the effect of&#13;
education on child mortality.  This finding is consistent with the findings in&#13;
items l(b) and 2(b) of Table 4-11, and the results of aggregate studies shown&#13;
in Figure 1.&#13;
When the sample is restricted to those countries where the bivariate&#13;
analysis showed significant relationship between education and mortality, the&#13;
results are more interesting: (1) higher levels of illiteracy result in&#13;
larger effects of education on child mortality; (2) greater government expend-&#13;
itures on health per capita result in less of an effect of education on&#13;
mortality; (3) in these equations life expectancy and the intercept do not&#13;
behave in the same way, life expectancy coefficients are less significant than&#13;
those for the intercept values and are perverse, but the intercept values show&#13;
that the higher mortality the greater the effect of education on mortality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92-&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
This analysis has indicated that maternal education is closely&#13;
related to child health whether measured by nutritional status or infant and&#13;
child mortality. The evidence on the significance of the relationship is&#13;
unequivocal. The magnitude is more difficult to determine. Bivariate&#13;
analysis of infant and child mortality indicates that on the average an&#13;
additional year of schooling for a mother results in a reduction of 9 per&#13;
1,000 in the mortality of her offspring. Multivariate analysis suggests that&#13;
part of this effect results from the fact that more educated women tend to be&#13;
married to more educated men., The best estimate is that the effect of&#13;
husband's education is about one half the effect of the wife's. Accordingly,&#13;
of the reduction of 9 per 1,000, approximately 3 per 1,000 is the result of&#13;
the wife's own education, and 3 per 1,000 the result of her husband's education.&#13;
The aggregate analysis within countries suggests that the estimates&#13;
of education's relationship with infant and child mortality obtained by using&#13;
aggregate data overstate the true effect because the education of an area&#13;
tends to be associated with other factors such as access to health care,&#13;
etc., which also result in improved health. This analysis and the analysis&#13;
of the factors associated with country differences in the strength of the&#13;
relationship between maternal education and child mortality suggests that&#13;
education's effect is greater in areas of high mortality. The latter analysis&#13;
also indicates that children's life chances can be equalized across educational&#13;
groups to some extent by higher government health expenditures.&#13;
The exact mechanism through which education acts to affect&#13;
child health is unclear. Better nutrition among the children of the more&#13;
educated has been well-documented here, and this would lead to improved&#13;
survival. But it is unclear to what extent these effects result from improved&#13;
knowledge directly resulting from education or.from higher income; the&#13;
analysis does, however, suggest that income differences cannot explain all&#13;
the effect, or perhaps even as much as half.&#13;

            This paper investigates the effects of
            education on health. The determinants of mortality are
            receiving increasing scrutiny because the rate of mortality
            reduction in the developing world appears to have slowed at
            levels of life expectancy below those thought attainable
            only a few years ago. The first perspective employed in this
            paper is a broad assessment of the socioeconomic
            determinants of mortality on a cross-national basis; using
            aggregate data, this paper contains a review and a
            reanalysis of the large body of literature that has
            accumulated on international differences in mortality and
            life expectancy. The second perspective sharpens the focus
            by concentrating on the relationship between education and
            mortality since the cross-national evidence suggests that
            education, or its proxy literacy, is the most important
            variable involved. A theoretical model of the relationship
            between parental education and child health is developed and
            used to describe how aggregate and individual data may give
            different estimates of the relationship. The third
            perspective employed reviews and reanalyzes the evidence at
            the subnational level. Individual evidence is reviewed on
            the relationship between parental education and both child
            nutrition and child mortality.
