LAKE VICTORIA ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A.   THE MACROECONOMIES&#13;
Kenya&#13;
1.1   Kenya remains a low-income country. Even though its population growth rate,&#13;
which historically has been very high (averaging 3.4 percent per annum as recently as&#13;
1987-91), dropped to about 3 percent in 1993, and although Kenya is one of the few&#13;
countries in Africa that experienced a decline in fertility in the eighties (from 7.7 in the&#13;
early 1980s to 5.2 in 1993), a significant and sustained increase in per capita income has&#13;
proved to be an elusive goal in Kenya during the past decade. In spite of a few years of&#13;
relatively good growth during the second half of the 1980s, the performance of the&#13;
economy has been particularly inadequate in generating new jobs, and there has been&#13;
no significant improvement in the incidence of poverty. Overall, the economy has&#13;
generated only marginal increases in per capita output over the past decade; during the&#13;
last four years, per capita income has actually declined - from $340 in 1991 to $260 in&#13;
1994 (at current prices and exchange rates).&#13;
1.2   The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which employs 70 percent of&#13;
the labor force and contributes about one quarter of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).&#13;
Coffee, tea and horticultural crops account for over 50 percent of merchandise exports.&#13;
Between 1991 and 1993, Kenya's macroeconomic performance was poor. In April 1992,&#13;
the Government agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on a program of&#13;
actions necessary to re-establish a sound macroeconomic framework which included&#13;
deficit reduction and liberalization of the foreign exchange regime. Until mid-1993, the&#13;
implementation of the actions required was unsatisfactory: although fiscal targets were&#13;
met, monetary targets were exceeded and the liberalization of the foreign exchange&#13;
regime proved to be unsustainable.&#13;
1.3   Sustained Government effort since mid-1993 to tighten fiscal and monetary&#13;
policy has resulted in effective economic stabilization and the revival of economic&#13;
growth. The fiscal deficit (exclusive of grants) has been sharply reduced over two years&#13;
from over 11 percent of GDP in FY93 to about 2.5 percent in FY95. Combined with a&#13;
generally tight monetary stance, these policies have resulted in the reduction of&#13;
inflation. Measured month over month, inflation peaked in January 1994 at 62 percent&#13;
and declined steadily to 6.6 percent in December 1994. The three-month annualized&#13;
inflation rate was reduced to 2.8 percent by the third quarter of 1995. Exchange rate&#13;
movements, after the initial inflation-induced depreciation to KSh 82 per US dollar in&#13;
June 1993, have reflected the interest rate response of short-term foreign capital flowing&#13;
in and out of Kenya. High interest rates led to the capital inflows which contributed to&#13;
a reserve accumulation and caused the shilling to appreciate to about KSh 45 per US&#13;
dollar by October 1994. The recent decline in domestic interest rates and the subsequent&#13;
capital outflow, as well as the gradual recovery of import demand, resulted in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
shilling depreciating in the second quarter of 1995 to about KSh 55 per US dollar where&#13;
it has since stabilized. In parallel with the improvement in inflation has been a&#13;
resumption of real economic growth. GDP growth (at factor cost) for 1994 is estimated&#13;
at 3 percent, the first significantly positive growth in three years, and it was projected at&#13;
around 5 percent for 1995.&#13;
1.4   Rising population pressures, migration and rapid urbanization have increased&#13;
the need for urgent actions to address Kenya's environmental problems. The more&#13;
critical problems are related to soil and land degradation, water resource management,&#13;
biomass and household energy issues, and the protection and management of fragile&#13;
ecosystems, including national parks. Rapid urbanization and inadequate physical&#13;
planning have also caused a significant deterioration in the urban environment. The&#13;
Government adopted a comprehensive National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in&#13;
June 1994. The challenge since its completion has been to translate the NEAP's broad&#13;
concerns about environmental management into an operational program of effective&#13;
policy, legislative and institutional action. Areas for priority action include the&#13;
development and adoption of a comprehensive environmental policy, the establishment&#13;
of an effective institutional and legal framework, and the formalizing of a requirement&#13;
for environmental impact assessments for all development projects.&#13;
Tanzania&#13;
1.5   By the early 1980s, Tanzania had come to be a heavily state-controlled economy,&#13;
whose rigid economic system was battered by numerous shocks, and whose inadequate&#13;
policies led to economic stagnation and a fall in per capita income lasting almost a&#13;
decade. Beginning in 1986, the Government embarked on a program to reform and&#13;
fundamentally change the existing approach to economic development by dismantling&#13;
the system of pervasive economic controls and encouraging more active participation of&#13;
the private sector in the economy. Structural reforms, particularly relating to traditional&#13;
exports and the parastatal and financial sectors, were not fully completed, and&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization remained elusive. Nevertheless, the economy responded&#13;
well to the reforms that were implemented (notably, liberalization of food crop&#13;
marketing and progressive improvements in foreign exchange management) and the&#13;
accompanying increased availability of external resources. Official estimates indicate&#13;
that GDP growth averaged about 4 percent per year and exports grew by more than 4&#13;
percent per year during 1986-94 (versus a 5 percent p.a. decline during 1979-85), with a&#13;
marked increase in food production, increased sales of traditional exports, and a&#13;
doubling in non-traditional agricultural exports since 1985.&#13;
1.6   Recent household surveys have shown that the adjustment program has been&#13;
successful in reducing the incidence of poverty. The devaluation of the shilling and&#13;
removal of restrictions on the marketing of food crops boosted production and incomes&#13;
of smallholder agricultural families. The increased availability of consumer goods as a&#13;
result of liberalization directly benefited the rural poor (as well as the urban poor who&#13;
also benefited from increased supplies of food from liberalized agricultural marketing),&#13;
and liberalization opened new earnings opportunities for rural women and for off-farm&#13;
employment. Sample surveys for the preparation of a Poverty Profile suggest that the&#13;
percentage of poor declined from about 70 percent of the rural population in the early&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
1980s to about 50 percent in the early 1990s. The liberalization program increased the&#13;
access of small-scale enterprises to production inputs which facilitated expansion of&#13;
low-wage employment in the informal sector.&#13;
1.7   Progress has been made in reforming the foreign exchange and trade systems&#13;
over the last two years. Tanzania has moved to an interbank market and has abolished&#13;
all export retention and import licensing, except for items related to health and national&#13;
security. Excessive monetary expansion has been fueled by worsening fiscal&#13;
management. The fiscal deficit (including grants) was about 6 percent of GDP in FY93&#13;
and 5 percent in FY94, after broadly balanced positions in the previous four years. This&#13;
reflected widespread and increasing customs duty exemptions, an increasingly&#13;
inefficient tax administration and the failure of the expenditure control system. Efforts&#13;
are being made in the current fiscal year (among then a public sector hiring freeze, and&#13;
reduced transfers to parastatals) to reduce the fiscal deficit below 4 percent of GDP.&#13;
Inflation, which had accelerated above 25 percent p.a. is targeted by efforts to bring it&#13;
down to 22 percent within the next fiscal year. Real GDP growth averaged about 3-4&#13;
percent per year during FY92 to FY94. Growth in FY94 was seriously compromised by&#13;
weak economic management, and severe power shortages caused largely by less-than-&#13;
average rainfall. These developments limited the scope for generating employment&#13;
and, in particular, the high inflation rates resulting from macroeconomic&#13;
mismanagement continue to erode the real incomes of the poor.&#13;
1.8   The recently completed National Environmental Action Plan focused on the&#13;
need for action in the key areas of land degradation, water supply, environmental&#13;
pollution, marine and freshwater resource management, habitat conservation and bio-&#13;
diversity, and deforestation. The action program for implementation includes revision&#13;
of the legislative framework to enable local participation in environmental management&#13;
more fully. Policies will support the environment in various ways, including applying&#13;
the forest and wildlife protection acts; developing the means for assessing&#13;
environmental quality, including water and air pollution; and strengthening&#13;
environmental awareness programs. Some Government policies are oriented towards&#13;
using incentives, such as implementing the new land policy to enhance the security of&#13;
tenure; pricing policies for fuel, including oil; and water rights to encourage efficient use&#13;
and environmentally sensitive practices.&#13;
Uganda&#13;
1.9   With a per capita income of about US$200, Uganda is one the poorest countries&#13;
in the world. Its weak economy and poor social indicators are the legacy of nearly 15&#13;
years of political turmoil and economic decline. Since 1987 the Government has been&#13;
implementing an economic reform program supported by a large number of donors.&#13;
The program aims to promote prudent fiscal and monetary management, improve&#13;
incentives to the private sector, reform the regulatory framework, and develop human&#13;
capital through investment in education, health and other social services. Economic&#13;
recovery and stabilization have been successful; hard-won macroeconomic stability has&#13;
been maintained for the past three years. The stability is precarious, however;&#13;
continuation of good policies and further improvement are therefore required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1.10  A number of the structural reforms are now well advanced and appear to be&#13;
accepted in Uganda. Nonetheless, the reform program has its detractors, and is still&#13;
very fragile. Achieving higher investment, growth, and increased employment&#13;
opportunities are critical for the sustainability of the program. Macroeconomic stability&#13;
remains fragile also, notwithstanding the progress that has been made in curtailing&#13;
public spending and strengthening the Shilling. With widespread poverty and massive&#13;
unmet public needs, it will be difficult to maintain expenditure constraints. The key is&#13;
to mobilize additional tax revenue, which is a very low proportion of GDP in Uganda.&#13;
Doing so has not proven easy. A large part of the economy is in the informal sector and&#13;
thus escapes taxation. Better tax administration, fewer exemptions and stronger&#13;
enforcement can help in the short run, but any significant gains in revenue will come at&#13;
best only in the medium-term. Uganda's current balance on the external account is also&#13;
fragile. While internal price and exchange rate stability, together with good prospects&#13;
for extended political calm, has generated a substantial inflow of private capital over the&#13;
past several months, these flows could be reversed quickly if inflation or exchange rate&#13;
volatility were to reappear. The dilemma facing policymakers is to get the economy&#13;
moving ahead more rapidly, without generating inflation which could unravel the&#13;
entire adjustment program.&#13;
1.11   Uganda's economic growth since 1987 has been good, but not spectacular. Real&#13;
GDP grew by an average of 5.4 percent per annum from FY87 to FY93, a gain of about&#13;
2.5 percent per annum in per capita terms. To a large extent this growth was the result&#13;
of bringing land and capital back into production, made possible by increased peace&#13;
and security. More recently growth has also been fueled by some private investment&#13;
and by the impact of trade, exchange rate and crop marketing liberalization.&#13;
Preliminary indications are that real GDP rose by 5 percent in FY94, mainly due to&#13;
strong performance by the manufacturing and construction sectors. The point has now&#13;
been reached where further growth will depend on increased private investment.&#13;
1.12 The NEAP was approved by the Government in January 1994. The National&#13;
Environmental Policy that was adopted subsequently calls for re-aligning sectoral&#13;
development strategies so that they address priority environmental concerns relating to,&#13;
among others, land degradation, deforestation, loss of wetlands, and dwindling fish&#13;
stocks, several of which are directly related to environmental management of the Lake&#13;
Victoria basin. The policy also emphasizes strategies cutting across sectors such as the&#13;
need to control population growth and enhance security of land tenure. It also&#13;
advocates environmental education and a system of environmental impact assessments&#13;
as essential means of promoting rational resource use. The National Environmental&#13;
Management Authority (NEMA) established recently will serve as the central policy&#13;
advisory body on the environment, and coordinate implementation of the NEAP.&#13;

B.    LAKE VICTORIA AND ITS SURROUNDS&#13;
Physical Description and Setting,&#13;
1.13   Lake Victoria (Map Number IBRD 27780), with a surface area of 68,800 km2 and&#13;
an adjoining catchment of 184,000 kM2, is the world's second largest body of fresh&#13;
water, and the largest in the developing world, second only to Lake Superior in size.&#13;
Lake Victoria touches the Equator in its northern reaches, and is relatively shallow,&#13;
reaching a maximum depth of about 80 m, and an average depth of about 40 m. The&#13;
lake's shoreline is long (about 3,500 km) and convoluted, enclosing innumerable small,&#13;
shallow bays and inlets, many of which include swamps and wetlands which differ a&#13;
great deal from one another and from the lake itself. Because the lake is shallow, its&#13;
volume is substantially less than that of other Eastern African lakes with much smaller&#13;
surface area. Lake Victoria holds about 2,760 km3 of water, only 15 percent of the&#13;
volume of Lake Tanganyika, even though the latter has less than half the surface area.&#13;
1.14   Some 85 percent of the water entering the lake does so from precipitation&#13;
directly on to the lake surface, the remainder coming from rivers which drain the&#13;
surrounding catchment. The most significant of these rivers, the Kagera, contributes&#13;
roughly 7 percent of the total inflow, or one half of that over and above direct&#13;
precipitation. The Kagera River, which rises in the highlands of Burundi and Rwanda,&#13;
forms the border between Rwanda and Tanzania before turning to the east, and flows&#13;
for at least 150 km completely in Tanzanian territory. It discharges into the lake just&#13;
north of the border between Tanzania and Uganda. Some 85 percent of the water&#13;
leaving the lake does so through direct evaporation from its surface, and the remaining&#13;
15 percent largely by way of the Victoria Nile, which leaves the lake near Jinja in&#13;
Uganda, and flows via the Owen Falls, Lake Kioga, and the Murchison Falls to join the&#13;
outflow from Lake Albert; these two outflows are the main sources of the "White Nile".&#13;
1.15   The lake's origins are still the subject of scientific dispute, but it seems likely that&#13;
it is much more recent than the other great lakes of eastern Africa. Many of the rivers&#13;
now flowing east into Victoria (including Kagera) once flowed west, at least in the&#13;
Miocene, Pliocene, and part of the Pleistocene eras (within the past 2 million years),&#13;
possibly eventually into the Nile system, and a more recent upthrust of the western side&#13;
of the basin is thought to have reversed these rivers, and caused Lake Victoria to form&#13;
by flowing eastwards. It is possible that the lake could have formed as recently as&#13;
25,000 to 35,000 years ago, and recent evidence suggests it may have dried up&#13;
completely between 10,000 and 14,000 years ago.&#13;
Biological and Environmental Significance&#13;
1.16   Although there are many features of Lake Victoria which are of intense interest&#13;
to biologists, it is fish that receive the most attention. Most of the fish species now in the&#13;
Much of the information for the description of Lake Victoria and its workings was drawn from the&#13;
following: Beadle, L.C., The Inland Waters of Tropical Africa: An Introduction to Tropical&#13;
Limnology, Longman, London &amp; New York, 1981,475 pp.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
lake also lived in the preceding, west-flowing rivers, but the cichlids, in particular, had a&#13;
remarkable burst of speciation in response to the change from river to lake conditions.&#13;
Similar things happened in the other great lakes, but in Lake Victoria it happened much&#13;
more recently, more rapidly, and with, at first sight, fewer opportunities for ecological&#13;
isolation in different types of habitat. The cichlids are capable of rapid genetic change,&#13;
and more prone to speciation than other groups of African fish. There are more than&#13;
200 endemic species and 4 endemic genera of cichlids in Lake Victoria, more than 150&#13;
species of which are of the genus Haplochromis. Another major lineage is the tilapiines.&#13;
From the primitive insect-eating types, mouths and pharynxes have evolved to allow&#13;
feeding on plants, molluscs, fish, and even the eggs and young larvae carried in the&#13;
mouths of brooding females of most cichlid species.&#13;
1.17  The non-cichlid fishes have also changed, and there are at least 50 species, of&#13;
which 29 are endemic, and one endemic genus. The non-cichlids show much less&#13;
divergence from the riverine stock than is the case with non-cichlid fish in Lake&#13;
Tanganyika, which has had a much longer time for them to diversify. While most of the&#13;
species remain year round in the lake, there are a number (at least 13 species) of&#13;
anadromous (ascending) fish, especially cyprinids, characids and siluroids, which swim&#13;
up the rivers when they are in flood, breed in a suitable place, and return with their&#13;
young fish to the lake as the level drops.&#13;
Economic Significance&#13;
1.18   Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda control 6,49, and 45 percent of the lake surface,&#13;
respectively. The gross economic product of the lake catchment is in the order of US$3-&#13;
4 billion annually, and supports an estimated population of 25 million people at&#13;
incomes in the range of US$90-270 per capita p.a. The lake catchment thus provides for&#13;
the livelihood of about one third of the combined populations of the three countries,&#13;
and about the same proportion of the combined gross domestic product. With the&#13;
exception of Kampala, the capital of Uganda, the lake catchment economy is principally&#13;
an agricultural one, with a number of cash crops (including exports of fish) and a high&#13;
level of subsistence fishing and agriculture. In Kenya and Uganda the areas of coffee&#13;
and tea in the catchment are a significant part of those nations' major agricultural&#13;
exports. The quality of the physical environment is therefore a fundamental factor in&#13;
maintaining and increasing the living standards of the growing population. Although it&#13;
is not possible to put a single estimate to the global value of the lake in sustaining the&#13;
regional economy, it can be seen that if the deterioration of the lake resulted in a (say) 5&#13;
percent reduction in productivity of the region, the consequent loss would be of the&#13;
order of US$150 million annually.&#13;
C.    MAJOR THREATS TO THE LAKE&#13;
1.19   The lake basin is used as a source of food, energy, drinking and irrigation water,&#13;
shelter, transport, and as a repository for human, agricultural and industrial waste.&#13;
With the populations of the riparian communities growing at rates among the highest in&#13;
the world, the multiple activities in the lake basin have increasingly come into conflict.&#13;
This has contributed to rendering the lake environmentally unstable. The lake&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
ecosystem has undergone substantial, and to some observers alarming changes, which&#13;
have accelerated over the last three decades. Massive blooms of algae have developed,&#13;
and come increasingly to be dominated by the potentially toxic blue-green variety. The&#13;
distance at which a white disc is visible from the surface, (a transparency index&#13;
measuring algal abundance), has declined from 5 metres in the early 1930s to one metre&#13;
or less for most of the year in the early 1990s. Water-borne diseases have increased in&#13;
frequency. Water hyacinth, absent as late as 1989, has begun to choke important&#13;
waterways and landings, especially in Uganda. Overfishing and oxygen depletion at&#13;
lower depths of the lake threaten the artisanal fisheries and biodiversity (over 200&#13;
indigenous species are said to be facing possible extinction). Scientists advance two&#13;
main hypotheses for these extensive changes. First, the introduction of Nile perch as an&#13;
exotic species some 30 years ago has altered the food web structure; second, nutrient&#13;
inputs from adjoining catchments are causing eutrophication. Thus although the lake&#13;
and its fishery show the evidence of the dramatic changes in the lake basin over the past&#13;
century, the lake is not the source of the problem. The problems have arisen in the&#13;
surrounding basins through human activity.&#13;
Lake Biota and Fisheries&#13;
1.20   One of the main events of importance to the lake system in the past thirty years&#13;
was the introduction of new species of fish in the lake. The first were four species of&#13;
tilapia (Cichlidae), which were introduced in the early 1950s. In 1955 the Nile Perch&#13;
Lates niloticus (Centropomidae) was introduced into Lake Kioga, and when a few years&#13;
later it was found in Lake Victoria, steps were taken to ensure its establishment there.&#13;
Until 1978, Nile Perch remained a very small proportion of the commercial catch, less&#13;
than 5 percent. Then in 1978 a very rapid expansion of the proportion accounted for by&#13;
Nile Perch took place, with the result that by 1990 the commercial catch had a totally&#13;
different composition, dominated by Nile Perch (almost 60 percent) and Omena (most&#13;
of the remaining 40 percent). The haplochromines, and the mixture of other fish had&#13;
virtually vanished from the commercial catch.2&#13;
1.21   It is important to note that the size of the fishery also exploded from 1978 on,&#13;
perhaps by a factor of five or more. From Kenyan waters alone the recorded catch&#13;
climbed from around 25,000 tons in 1978 to more than 175,000 tons in 1990. In the years&#13;
preceding introduction of the Nile Perch, the total fisheries yield from the lake may&#13;
have been in the vicinity of 100,000 tons, while in more recent years yields have been&#13;
estimated in the range of 300,000 to 500,000 tons.3&#13;

Water Hyacinth&#13;
1.22  Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is a flowering plant, whose origin is thought&#13;
to be the Amazon areas of Brazil. It appeared in Lake Naivasha in Kenya in 1982, and in&#13;
Lake Kioga in Uganda in 1988. In Tanzania, it was first reported in 1990. Its first&#13;
recorded appearance in Lake Victoria was in Ugandan waters in 1988. Since then it has&#13;
been reported in many locations, all around the lake, in the waters of all three riparian&#13;
countries. It is especially concentrated in Ugandan waters, possibly because the&#13;
prevailing southerly winds blow mats of the weed all the way from the mouth of the&#13;
Kagera River, down which the mats flow from lakes far up in the catchments in Rwanda&#13;
and Burundi. The hyacinth also flourishes in nutrient-rich waters, as those along the&#13;
Uganda shoreline of the lake are believed to be. The area between Entebbe and the&#13;
Uganda/Kenya border has widespread floating mats of water hyacinth, some of which&#13;
reach more than 1,000 ha in size.&#13;
1.23  The main detrimental effects of the spreading mats of water hyacinth are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)   reduction in fish in the lake through de-oxygenation of water and&#13;
reduction of nutrients in sheltered bays which are breeding and nursery&#13;
grounds for fish, particularly tilapia;&#13;
(b)   physical interference with fishing operations, especially in the bays&#13;
where fish are brought ashore to piers or landing beaches;&#13;
(c)   physical interference with commercial transportation services for people&#13;
and goods on the lake;&#13;
(d)   physical interference with access to water supply from the lake, for both&#13;
urban and rural communities, together with additions to the cost of&#13;
purifying water with higher concentrations of suspended, decaying&#13;
organic matter as a result of the hyacinth presence;&#13;
(e)   threats to the intakes at the Owen Falls hydroelectric power station in&#13;
Uganda; and&#13;
(f)   provision of a preferred breeding habitat for the alternative host for&#13;
Schistosomiasis (bilharzia), namely the Biomphalaria snail, a home for the&#13;
vector mosquito for malaria, and a haven for snakes.&#13;
Eutrophication&#13;
1.24 Water quality in Lake Victoria has declined greatly in the past few decades,&#13;
owing chiefly to eutrophication arising from increased inflow of nutrients into the lake.&#13;
Nutrient inputs have increased two to three-fold since the turn of the century, mostly&#13;
since 1950. Concentrations of phosphorus have risen markedly in the deeper lake&#13;
waters, and nitrogen around the edges. Stimulated by these and other nutrients, the&#13;
five-fold increase in algal growth since 1960, and the shift in its composition towards&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
domination by blue-green algae, is causing deoxygenation of the water, increased&#13;
sickness for humans and animals drawing water from the lake, clogging of water intake&#13;
filters, and increased chemical treatment costs for urban centers. Aside from the near-&#13;
total loss of the deepwater species, the deoxygenation of the lake's bottom waters now&#13;
poses a constant threat, even to fish in shallower portions of the lake, as periodic&#13;
upwelling of hypoxic water causes massive fish kills. The increased nutrient loads have&#13;
also spurred the water hyacinth infestations.&#13;
1.25   The nutrients represent a transfer of materials at an increasing rate from the&#13;
terrestial basin to the lake. Among others, these transfers comprise organic and&#13;
inorganic suspended solids and dissolved nutrients carried by streams, terrestrial dust&#13;
from wind erosion, inorganic compounds in the smoke produced by combustion (in&#13;
cooking fires or forest burning), and direct additions along the lake shores of human&#13;
and animal waste associated with domestic water use. Preliminary estimates suggest&#13;
the increased nutrient inflows are coming largely from rural areas, but although the&#13;
main causes of the eutrophication are known, the rates of enrichment, its sources, and&#13;
its numerous effects are not well quantified. Since many of the farms in the area apply&#13;
no fertilizers, or use very small quantities, these are not likely to be a major source of the&#13;
nutrients, nor will they be until fertilizer application rates reach substantially higher&#13;
levels than currently seen. Rather, the nutrients may be released from soil partides&#13;
washed or blown off the land surface by erosion, from burning wood-fuels, and from&#13;
human and animal waste from areas surrounding the lake. From the urban areas, the&#13;
main source is untreated sewage, which beside providing additional nutrients, also&#13;
increases the disease risk from water borne pathogens. Thus the water quality problems&#13;
of the lake arise in the watershed, not in the lake, and it is in the catchment that the&#13;
solutions must be found.&#13;
Water Pollution&#13;
1.26  Some areas of the rivers feeding the lake and the shoreline are particularly&#13;
polluted by municipal and industrial discharges. Some information has been collected&#13;
by local and national authorities on the scale and location of polluting industries, and&#13;
there are a number of basic industries that are common to most of the major urban&#13;
areas, for example, breweries, tanning, fish processing, agroprocessing (sugar, coffee)&#13;
and abattoirs. Some of these have implemented pollution management measures but in&#13;
general the level of industrial pollution control is low. Small scale gold mining is&#13;
increasing, in Tanzania in particular, and this is leading to some contamination of the&#13;
local waterways by mercury which is used to amalgamate and recover the gold. Some&#13;
traces of other heavy metals, such as chromium and lead, are also found in the lake,&#13;
although the problem has not yet reached major proportions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2.   STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK&#13;
A.   PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
2.1   Attempts at fisheries collaboration among Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are&#13;
among the oldest on the continent. As early as 1928, it was recommended that a unified&#13;
lake-wide authority for regulation and for collection of fisheries statistics be set up.&#13;
Establishment of the East African Freshwater Fisheries Research Organization&#13;
(EAFFRO) in 1947 solidified collaboration, and it was boosted further with formation of&#13;
the East African Community in 1967. In the early 1970s, all three countries became&#13;
members of the FAO Committee for Inland Fisheries of Africa (CIFA). After the&#13;
disappearance of this coordinating mechanism with the ending of the East African&#13;
Community in 1977, the need for collaboration was felt so strongly that a special CIFA&#13;
Sub-Committee for Lake Victoria was set up in 1980. Although this was a useful forum&#13;
for the three countries, the difficulty of implementing management measures on a lake-&#13;
wide basis due to the lack of a strong inter-governmental mechanism for harmonization&#13;
of such measures, led to the design of proposals for the Lake Victoria Fisheries&#13;
Organization (LVFO), whose establishment the current project would support. Most&#13;
importantly, the current project would, for the first time, ensure that regional fisheries&#13;
management would operate within a regional framework for environmental action,&#13;
rather than having only a commercial orientation.&#13;
2.2   Each of the three riparian Governments has prepared a National Environmental&#13;
Action Plan (NEAP). All three NEAPS acknowledge that Lake Victoria demands urgent&#13;
attention through regional cooperation. The NEAPs focus on problems such as water&#13;
pollution, biodiversity loss, land degradation, deforestation, and damage to wetlands,&#13;
all central concerns for the lake and its catchments. Scientists and resource managers&#13;
have increasingly warned that the absence of a regional management framework may&#13;
threaten the future viability of the lake basin. Discussions to broaden regional&#13;
environmental cooperation covering the Lake Victoria Basin started in late 1992. In May&#13;
1994 the three Governments decided to enter into an agreement jointly to prepare and&#13;
implement a Lake Victoria Environmental Management Program. A Tripartite&#13;
agreement to this effect was signed August 5, 1994. The essential soundness of this&#13;
agreement has been proven during project preparation, and its main institutional&#13;
arrangements, which have worked well, will continue into project implementation.&#13;
2.3   The Tripartite Agreement of 1994, as enhanced by the government preparation&#13;
report, constitutes a framework for action fully responsive to the requirement for a&#13;
Strategic Action Plan (SAP). This SAP, whose preparation included extensive&#13;
stakeholder consultation, was reviewed thoroughly during appraisal. It identifies,&#13;
acknowledges and analyzes the transboundary water-related environmental concerns&#13;
which the three governments share in common. Furthermore, it expresses their&#13;
determination jointly to build the capacity of existing institutions, and establish new&#13;
ones, in order that they may adopt a comprehensive approach to addressing the shared&#13;
transboundary concerns, and implement measures to deal with the priority concerns as&#13;
identified, with a particular focus on community stakeholder involvement and&#13;
measures to raise public awareness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.4   Preparation of the LVEMP took into account ongoing activities funded by the&#13;
Global Environment Facility under the project Institutional Support for the Protection of&#13;
East African Biodiversity (UNO/RAF/006/GEF), implemented by FAO and UNDP.&#13;
The first phase of that project is coming to an end in 1996, just as the LVEMP&#13;
commences implementation. The latter will build particularly on the wetlands&#13;
components of the Institutional Support project, through which funds were provided to&#13;
wetlands programs under the technical oversight of the IUCN (The World Conservation&#13;
Union). These initiatives have established committees on wetlands in all three riparian&#13;
countries, which would coordinate wetlands components under the LVEMP.&#13;
2.5   A large number of donors have supported a vast range of development&#13;
initiatives in and around Lake Victoria. Some of these have addressed priority&#13;
environmental concerns, but mostly in small, uncoordinated, and incomplete ways, and&#13;
seldom with informed intentionality which had the wider environmental priorities in&#13;
mind. In the absence of a coordinated management and information system for the&#13;
entire lake and its ecosystem, these smaller projects have often fallen short, and&#13;
continue to fall short, of realizing their maximum potential. Although often successful&#13;
in their own terms, they could have achieved even more by being part of a coordinated&#13;
management initiative to address the lake ecosystem and its problems. The current&#13;
project is such a management initiative, which will lead to a quantum leap in&#13;
understanding the ecosystem, and in devising sustainable management strategies.&#13;
B.    THE LAKE VICTORIA REGION IN THE FUTURE&#13;
2.6   The Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) will therefore&#13;
become the heart of the wider investments needed in the lake basin in forthcoming&#13;
years in direct actions to clean up the lake and its catchment, and manage the ecosystem&#13;
in a sustainable way. Substantial investments will be needed in direct actions to reduce&#13;
nutrient inflows from human waste (in both urban and rural areas), to decrease soil&#13;
erosion, to clean up industrial effluent, and reduce pollution from all sources. The&#13;
project will provide the information and build the capacity to coordinate the substantial&#13;
sums likely to be available for financing these direct actions in the next five years and&#13;
beyond. In the LVEMP itself an estimated 20 percent of project costs will be directed&#13;
towards studies, 42 percent towards capacity building, and 38 percent towards direct&#13;
actions.&#13;
2.7   A much broader program of investments in direct actions is already shaping up&#13;
around the LVEMP, directed towards actions to improve human sanitation and reduce&#13;
soil erosion in the lake basin. The bulk of these will take their cues from the early&#13;
findings of the LVEMP. When these investments are included, the proportion of the&#13;
program allocated for direct actions will increase markedly. Undoubtedly there will be&#13;
substantial additional flows from other donors. The LVEMP mid-term update to the&#13;
analysis of transboundary environmental concerns will guide the second phase of&#13;
project implementation, and set the stage for subsequent initiatives. The&#13;
Implementation Completion Report to be prepared by the three governments at the end&#13;
of the LVEMP will include a revised Strategic Action Program outlining interventions&#13;
needed to address priority problems. IDA will use this as the basis for seeking&#13;
commitments to support such interventions from the wider donor community. Thus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
the LVEMP will be the essential first step in a long-term program for restoring and&#13;
sustaining the ecological foundations for economic development in the entire lake basin.&#13;
2.8   Furthermore, the LVEMP itself will include a study of potential sources of&#13;
funding for continuing support of fisheries management, and other collaborative&#13;
arrangements for sustaining the ecosystem established by the three riparian countries&#13;
during this first phase. The study will assess possibilities for raising and coordinating&#13;
levies on the commercial fisheries to enable some of the central monitoring and&#13;
management initiatives to become fiscally sustainable. The LVEMP includes financial&#13;
support for establishing a shared Levy Trust Fund among the three countries, should&#13;
the study show this to be feasible.&#13;
2.9   The economy of the lake basin is based on agriculture (about 35 percent), lake&#13;
fisheries (about 10 percent), industries and mining (about 15 percent) and the tertiary&#13;
sector (about 40 percent). The structure of the economy will continue to change as the&#13;
population grows, with livelihoods found increasingly in the secondary and tertiary&#13;
sectors rather than the primary. There is considerable scope for increases in agricultural&#13;
production, however, and especially in its value-added, as it is intensified and&#13;
diversified into higher valued enterprises. Because of their size, a significant proportion&#13;
of additional jobs will be found in agriculture and the fisheries for the foreseeable&#13;
future. It is vital that the additional pressure this will put on the resource base is&#13;
managed well, in order to head off increasing deterioration. The project aims at&#13;
providing the foundation for this improved management, (and thus for sustainable&#13;
development of the local economy), while the ancillary investments are regarded as&#13;
vital to clean up the lake, and reduce nutrient and pollution inflows to within acceptable&#13;
limits.&#13;
3.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The LVEMP is a comprehensive program aimed at rehabilitation of the lake&#13;
ecosystem for the benefit of the people who live in the catchment, the national&#13;
economies of which they are a part, and the global community. The program objectives&#13;
are to: (a) maximize the sustainable benefits to riparian communities from using&#13;
resources within the basin to generate food, employment and income, supply safe&#13;
water, and sustain a disease-free environment; and (b) conserve biodiversity and genetic&#13;
resources for the benefit of the riparian communities and the global community. In&#13;
order to address the tradeoffs among these objecdves which cut across national&#13;
boundaries, a further project objective is to harmonize national management programs&#13;
in order to achieve, to the maximum extent possible, the reversal of increasing&#13;
environmental degradation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
B.    GENERAL DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2   The project is the first phase of a longer term program whose aims are as&#13;
outlined above. The first phase will provide the necessary information to improve&#13;
management of the lake ecosystem, establish mechanisms for cooperative management&#13;
by the three countries, identify and demonstrate practical, self-sustaining remedies,&#13;
while simultaneously building capacity for ecosystem management. The project will&#13;
consist of two broad sets of activities. The first set of activities, which are designed to&#13;
address specific environmental threats, will take place in a series of selected pilot zones.&#13;
The second set of activities, which will improve information on the lake and build&#13;
capacity for more effective management, will be of necessity lake-wide in scope.&#13;
3.3   In the pilot zones, the project would do the following in an integrated way:&#13;
develop groundwater resources; conserve and develop wetlands; reduce sediment and&#13;
nutrient flow, especially of phosphorus, into the lake; reduce fecal coliform and&#13;
municipal nutrient output into the lake; regulate industrial effluent; define current&#13;
contamination of fish and prevent any increase; stabilize the catch of Nile Perch, and&#13;
increase the catch of indigenous species; increase incomes of local fisherfolk; and reduce&#13;
water hyacinth to manageable levels. A total of fourteen pilot zones have been&#13;
identified, four in Kenya, and five in each of Tanzania and Uganda. Work would be&#13;
started in one pilot zone in each country in the first year - Nyakach Bay in Kenya&#13;
(including the city of Kisumu), Mwanza Gulf in Tanzania (including the city of&#13;
Mwanza), and Napoleon Bay in Uganda (including the city of Jinja). The other pilot&#13;
zones are Berkeley Bay, Usenge-Yala, and Karungu Bay (Kenya); Mara-Shirati Bay,&#13;
Speke Gulf, Emin Pasha Gulf, and Kagera-Rubafu Bay (Tanzania); and MacDonald-&#13;
Berkeley Bay, Murchison Bay, Sesse Islands, and Sango Bay (Uganda).&#13;
3.4   Among lake-wide actions the project would: assess and measure sources of&#13;
nutrients causing eutrophication; measure fisheries-trophic state interactions; model&#13;
and monitor lake circulation; define and measure the contaminant threat; harmonize&#13;
regulation and legislation; monitor recovery and impact; and build institutional&#13;
capacity.&#13;
3.5   The project would support the following specific regional and national program&#13;
activities: (a) management of fisheries, including the establishment and operations of&#13;
the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organisation [US$2.3 m], improvement of fisheries research&#13;
and the information base for fisheries [US$13.3 ml, strengthening of extension,&#13;

C.    PROJECr DETAILS&#13;
Fisheries Management [US$2.28 million]&#13;
3.6   A Convention for the Establishment of the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organisation&#13;
(LVFO), drafted with FAO assistance, was discussed in the three countries in late 1993&#13;
and early 1994, and signed by all three countries on 30 June, 1994. The proposed LVFO&#13;
will be presided over by a Council of Ministers responsible for fisheries. It will have an&#13;
Executive Committee made up of Directors of Fisheries Research, a Fisheries&#13;
Management Committee, a Scientific Committee, such other sub-committees and&#13;
working groups as might be needed from time to time, and a Permanent Secretariat&#13;
located in Entebbe, Uganda. The LVFO will promote better management of fisheries on&#13;
the lake, coordinate fisheries management with conservation and use of other lake&#13;
resources, collaborate closely with all existing bodies (public and private, governmental&#13;
and non-governmental) dealing with the lake, and all programs for its management&#13;
(especially those relating to water quality), coordinate fisheries extension and related&#13;
training, consider and advise on introduction of any non-indigenous aquatic animals or&#13;
plants into the waters of the lake, and disseminate information on Lake Victoria&#13;
fisheries.&#13;
3.7   The Secretariat, headed by an Executive Secretary (assisted by a Deputy), will&#13;
have four permanent higher level staff - a Senior Biologist, Senior Economist,&#13;
Administrative Officer (Finance) and Administrative Officer (Information and&#13;
Database). It will engage short-term consultants (a total of 50 months over five years)&#13;
specializing in legal matters, socio-economics, fish processing technology, fish&#13;
harvesting technology, and water hyacinth control. It will be financed by GEF (90&#13;
percent). The project will finance vehicles; renovations of offices; office equipment;&#13;
personnel costs, and operation and maintenance expenditures.&#13;
Fisheries Research [US$13.33 million]&#13;
3.8   The program for fisheries research will provide information on the ecology of&#13;
the lake and its catchment, the biology of its flora and fauna, the impact of&#13;
environmental factors on the lake system, and socio-economic implications of use of the&#13;
lake's resources. This information will contribute towards improved ecological&#13;
efficiency, greater biodiversity, and ecological balance in the lake system. The research&#13;
program will be operated by scientists with the help and participation of the extension&#13;
services, fisherfolk community leaders, Government departments, and other&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
3.9   The fisheries research component will have five sub-components: studies of fish&#13;
biology and biodiversity conservation, aquaculture, socio-economics, database&#13;
establishment, and a fish stock assessment. The stock assessment will be financed by&#13;
the European Union under a separate agreement, and although it is described below to&#13;
provide a complete outline of the fisheries research program, the LVEMP would ensure&#13;
only its coordination with other project components.&#13;
(a) Fish Biology and Biodiversity Conservation [US$6.58 million]&#13;
3.10   This program will identify the main factors affecting aquatic biodiversity,&#13;
determine diversity in aquatic flora and fauna, document them, map their habitats,&#13;
educate people on their importance, and propose ways to exploit them sustainably. The&#13;
program will rectify the serious lack of knowledge about the entire aquatic population&#13;
of the lake, focusing especially on non-commercial fish of great biological interest, their&#13;
species composition, population structure, food and feeding habits, trophic&#13;
relationships, reproduction and breeding habits, recruitment patterns, growth, oxygen&#13;
tolerance, mortality, and migrations, as well as the other organisms which play key roles&#13;
in sustaining the Lake Victoria ecosystem, including specifically other aquatic&#13;
vertebrates (frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals), macroinvertebrates (insects, molluscs,&#13;
Caridina), microinvertebrates (copepods, cladcerans, rotifers), phytoplankton (diatoms,&#13;
cyanophytes, green algae), macrophytes, and bacteria. The primary aim of this program&#13;
is to gain information with which to design initiatives to sustain a complex ecosystem of&#13;
substantial scientific importance. The outcomes of the studies will be species&#13;
distribution and habitat maps, information on the genetic make up and diversity of&#13;
different populations, understanding of the causes of decline of fish species,&#13;
understanding of the impact of environmental changes on the biology, behaviour and&#13;
survival of declining species, guidelines for species conservation and restoration, an&#13;
updated bibliography of Lake Victoria, training of scientists, and dissemination of&#13;
information to stakeholders through reports, videos, and workshops.&#13;
3.11   This sub-component will be implemented by the Fishery Research Institutes in&#13;
the three countries, KEMFRI, TAFIRI, and FIRI, and financed by GEF (90 percent). The&#13;
project will finance vehicles and boats; office, laboratory and field equipment; training&#13;
and workshops; technical assistance; personnel costs, and operation and maintenance&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
(b) Aquaculture [US$3.10 million]&#13;
3.12   This program aims at restoring and sustaining the survival of several&#13;
endangered and threatened species of fish. The program will address the continuing&#13;
pressures to introduce more fish species into the lake (to take advantage of their&#13;
production characteristics or market attraction), but wiU do so by avoiding the&#13;
unforeseen effects of exotic introductions. The program will study the domestication of&#13;
indigenous species of high nutritional value. The aim is to perfect aquaculture methods&#13;
for such species, to assist them to compete in the market place with exotic tilapiines and&#13;
carp. The outcomes of the program will be restored populations of selected endangered&#13;
and threatened species (particularly Oreochromis esculentus, Oreochromnis variabilis,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Labeo victorianus, Bagrus docmac, and Protopterus aethiopicus), improved fish supply&#13;
to local riparian communities, return of delicacies to consumer markets, and&#13;
development of commercial activity in ornamental species which will secure their&#13;
survival rather than threatening it as at present.&#13;
3.13  This sub-component will be implemented by the Fishery Research Institutes in&#13;
the three countries (KEMFRI, TAFIRI, and FIRI); the Fisheries Departments of the&#13;
Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife (Kenya), Ministry of Natural Resources (Tanzania),&#13;
and Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (Uganda); in collaboration&#13;
with local communities and NGOs. It will be financed by GEF (45 percent) and IDA (45&#13;
percent). The project will finance vehicles and boats; office, laboratory and field&#13;
equipment; training and workshops; technical assistance; personnel costs, and operation&#13;
and maintenance expenditures.&#13;
(c) and (d) Socio-Economics and Database [US$3.65 million]&#13;
3.14 The aim of this program is to provide information which will be used to improve&#13;
management of the lake resources in order that local communities will increase their&#13;
benefits from the fishery, while sustaining the ecosystem from which the benefits arise.&#13;
The initial actions will be to analyze and disseminate data from previous and ongoing&#13;
projects on: (a) small scale fishing and fish commodity systems (financed by the&#13;
International Development Research Center [IDRC]); (b) understanding the socio-&#13;
economic impacts of changes in the lake fisheries (financed by the private MacArthur&#13;
Foundation); (c) sustainable management of ecotones (transition areas between adjacent&#13;
ecological communities) in collaboration with the University of Zurich; and (d)&#13;
management strategies of fishing communities (financed by the EU).&#13;
3.15  The program will further provide information on current fishery distribution&#13;
patterns, community involvement in harvesting up to marketing of fish, how activities&#13;
of fisherfolk contribute to environmental degradation, nutrition, health and other social&#13;
amenities of lakeside communities, alternative management systems incorporating&#13;
different stakeholders, the contribution of fisheries to the three national economies, and&#13;
the consequences of changes in fishing policies. The program outputs will be evolution&#13;
of policies with greater community participation, a larger share for communities in the&#13;
harvesting and marketing of fish, more fish available in local communities, and better&#13;
health and social services for these communities. The database program will develop&#13;
bibliographies and a central clearing house for information about the lake, an electronic&#13;
communications network, and tram librarians and other database managers.&#13;
3.16  This sub-component will be implemented by the Fishery Research Institutes in&#13;
the three countries (KEMFRI, TAFIRI, and FIRI), in collaboration with Fisheries&#13;
Extension, riparian universities, local communities and NGOs. It will be financed by&#13;
GEF (23 percent) and IDA (67 percent). The project will finance vehicles and boats;&#13;
office, laboratory and field equipment; books and journal subscriptions; training and&#13;
workshops; technical assistance; personnel costs, and operation and maintenance&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
(e) Stock Assessment [financed separately by the EU]&#13;
3.17   The first comprehensive stock assessment survey since 1969/74, and the first&#13;
since the far-reaching changes believed to have occurred in the ecology of the lake, this&#13;
exercise wiUl focus on prime commercial species, and will provide information about the&#13;
size of the fish stock, distribution and movement patterns, population structure,&#13;
breeding habits, estimates of potential yield, characteristics of fishing gear, catch rates,&#13;
description of the lake bottom, and updated bathymetric maps. Outcomes of the&#13;
program wiU be guidelines for fishery conservation, sustainable use, permissible quotas,&#13;
closed seasons, protected areas, and proposals for an integrated education program.&#13;
Fisheries Extension, Policies, Laws and Their Enforcement [US$14.09 million]&#13;
3.18   The intention in the project is to separate law enforcement and extension&#13;
activities. The law enforcemnent activities will comprise harmonisation of legislation&#13;
among the three countries, identification and establishment of closed fishing areas&#13;
(gazetted sanctuaries important for fish breeding, nurseries and juvenile feeding) in&#13;
Kenya and Uganda, and verification of those already set up in Tanzania, training and&#13;
empowerment of fisheries law enforcement officers, and establishment of customs posts&#13;
at selected border landing sites (Muhoru and Port Victoria in Kenya; Kirongwe and&#13;
Rubafu in Tanzania; and Mizinda/Kasensero and Sigulu Island in Uganda). The&#13;
extension activities wil comprise introduction of new techniques (such as lift netting and&#13;
live bait fishing), small scale aquaculture, and promoting organisations of fisherfolk&#13;
which will guard fisheries against illegal entry and gear thefts, act as channels for&#13;
improved gear and credit, and assist with overall monitoring of fisheries in the lake.&#13;
The program will begin in three pilot zones in the first year, and then be evaluated&#13;
thoroughly before being expanded to a further six pilot zones in the third year, and five&#13;
more in the fourth year. The program will also establish one fish quality control&#13;
laboratory in each country (to carry out testing for microbes, heavy metals, pathogens,&#13;
pesticides and other contaminants), and will study ways to reduce post-harvest losses of&#13;
fish through improvements in handling and processing, and strengthening and&#13;
harmonising data collection in the respective national Fisheries Departments. Included&#13;
in the component are provisions for micro-projects in selected fishing communities.&#13;
These will comprise small investments in community water supply from ground-water,&#13;
sanitary facilities, local roads, and health facilities. Details of management&#13;
arrangements for these are set out in the section on project implementation.&#13;
3.19 This component will be implemented by the Fisheries Departments of the&#13;
Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife (Kenya), Ministry of Natural Resources (Tanzania),&#13;
and Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (Uganda); in collaboration with the&#13;
Fishery Research Institutes in the three countries (KEMFRI, TAFIRI, and FIRI), local&#13;
communities and NGOs. It will be financed by IDA (90 percent). The project will&#13;
finance vehicles and boats; office, laboratory and field equipment; books and journal&#13;
subscriptions; training and workshops; technical assistance; construction of fish ponds;&#13;
and construction of community facilities for water supply from ground-water,&#13;
sanitation, roads, and health; personnel costs, and operation and maintenance&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Fish Levy Trust [US$2.03 million]&#13;
3.20 This component will study and implement a system to collect levies from the&#13;
fishing industry and use them in support of fisheries and ecosystem management in the&#13;
lake and its catchment. In the first year of the project a study will be carried out of&#13;
mechanisms for revenue collection and disbursement already in operation in each&#13;
country, and additional possibilities for revenue collection. In the second year of the&#13;
project the findings of the study will be discussed and agreed among the three&#13;
governments, and a system to collect and disburse levies will be established in the third&#13;
year of the project. The study will be carried out by consultants under the supervision&#13;
of the Fisheries Departments of the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife (Kenya), Ministry&#13;
of Natural Resources (Tanzania), and Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and&#13;
Fisheries (Uganda), in collaboration with the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization. It&#13;
will be financed by IDA (90 percent). The project will finance vehicles; office&#13;
equipment; training and workshops; technical assistance; personnel costs, and operation&#13;
and maintenance expenditures.&#13;
Water Hyacinth Control [US$8.31 million]&#13;
3.21 The aim of the program is to establish sustainable long-term capacity for&#13;
maintaining control of water hyacinth and other invasive weeds in the Lake Victoria&#13;
Basin. This will be achieved by an integrated effort involving intensified publicity,&#13;
legislation, and integrated pest management with community involvement. The control&#13;
program will rely on mechanical methods and limited chemical interventions for rapid&#13;
short term control in restricted areas, and biological agents for longer term control.&#13;
Reducing nutrient inflows into the lake will be a vital element in long term approaches&#13;
to dealing with the problem. The biological control program will rely initially on&#13;
multiplication and release of two weevil species that have been used and found effective&#13;
world-wide, and have already been imported, reared and released in Kenya and&#13;
Uganda. The species are the chevroned water hyacinth weevil (Neochetina bruchi&#13;
Hystache) and the water hyacinth weevil (Neochetina eichorniae Warner). These two&#13;
species are complementary in their action. The possibilities will be explored for&#13;
supplementing the weevils by later releases of the moth Sameodes albiguttalis. The main&#13;
elements of the biological control program will be establishment of mass rearing&#13;
capacity in units around the shores of the lake as rapidly as possible, a coordinated field&#13;
release program involving local community participation, monitoring performance of&#13;
biological control agents in the field, and development of a monitoring and evaluation&#13;
protocol and training program.&#13;
3.22  Implementation of the water hyacinth control program will be led by the&#13;
agricultural research organizations of the three countries, namely the Kenya&#13;
Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) in the Ministry of Research, Technical Training&#13;
and Technology, the Uganda National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) in&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, and the Tanzania&#13;
Department of Research and Training in the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock,&#13;
Cooperatives and Development. The agricultural research institutions will be&#13;
responsible, in particular, for the program to multiply and disperse the biological&#13;
control agents. National Water Hyacinth Steering Committees will be established in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
each country to oversee and coordinate the program, and to ensure the involvement of&#13;
local communities and NGOs. The program will be financed by GEF (54 percent) and&#13;
IDA (36 percent). The project will finance vehicles and boats; office, laboratory and field&#13;
equipment; laboratory chemicals and herbicides; biological control agents; rearing&#13;
facilities for bio-agents and renovation of offices and laboratories; training and&#13;
workshops; technical assistance; personnel costs, and operation and mnaintenance&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
Water Quality and Ecosystem Management [US$9.58 million]&#13;
3.23   The aim of this component is to elucidate the nature and dynamics of the lake&#13;
ecosystem by providing detailed information on the characteristics of the waters of the&#13;
lake. The program will provide details of limnological changes, model and predict their&#13;
short and long term consequences, and provide guidelines for ameliorating potentially&#13;
disastrous changes. The program will provide quantitative information on nutrient&#13;
loading and recycling in the lake (particularly the internal loading of sediment&#13;
phosphorus); sources and mechanics of eutrophication and pollution and their effect on&#13;
lake productivity (with a particular focus on ways to stabilize or reduce eutrophic&#13;
status); phytoplankton communities and their composition; algal blooms and their&#13;
dynamics; lake zooplankton, microbes, benthic flora and fauna, lake fly and their roles;&#13;
primary production including estirnation of lake carrying capacity; stratification of the&#13;
lake and the increasing problem of anoxia; trophic inter-relationships; and lake&#13;
palaeolimnology.&#13;
3.24   The program will consist of one core project, namely Management of&#13;
Eutrophication [US$6.86 million], two pilot projects, Sedimentation Studies [US$0.63&#13;
million] and Hydraulic Conditions in Lake Victoria [US$0.95 million], and construction&#13;
of a model of water circulation and quality in the lake, designed to help manage the&#13;
problems. The core project aims to establish periodic assessment of physical and&#13;
chemical characteristics of the lake system. It will measure temperatures in different&#13;
strata, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, factors affecting light penetration such as&#13;
suspended silt/sedimentation concentrations, water clarity, and spectral characteristics,&#13;
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels, levels of heavy metals (mercury, chromium&#13;
and lead), pesticide residues, abundance and species composition of phyto- and zoo-&#13;
plankton, phytoplankton primary production, levels of B-coli and E-coli. Analysis of&#13;
these and other data will establish rates of change in water quality, relate these to the&#13;
observed status of inputs from the catchment, estimate the effects of poor water quality&#13;
on the economy of the region, and establish the basis for a practicable pollution control&#13;
program.&#13;
3.25   The pilot sedimentation study will estimate sedimentation rates at the mouths of&#13;
three rivers, the Kagera (Uganda), Simiyu (Tanzania) and Nyando (Kenya). It will&#13;
assess the rate of release of nutrients from sediments, analyze sediment-biota&#13;
associations, and compare the data with soil losses from surrounding areas. The pilot&#13;
hydraulic study will measure patterns of water circulation in the Rusinga Channel&#13;
(Kenya), and in similar areas in Tanzanian and Uganda waters, (Mwanza Bay and&#13;
Murchison/Pilkington Bays respectively) to determine the interaction between vertical&#13;
and horizontal circulation components, improve existing estimates of hydraulic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
retention periods in the lake, and develop simulation models of the dynamics of&#13;
nutrients and phytoplankton which will be used to predict the impacts of&#13;
eutrophication control programs and pollution intervention strategies.&#13;
3.26  Under the former Hydromet Project, in 1979/80, executed by the World&#13;
Meteorological Organisation (WMO) a Lake Victoria Water Quality Model was&#13;
constructed, designed to be linked with a hydrological model developed with&#13;
UNDP/WMO assistance. Unfortunately, this model was not calibrated, tested, or&#13;
validated. The basic process formulations in this model will be re-assessed to determine&#13;
their current validity, bearing in mind that scientific information about the lake has&#13;
increased since the model was constructed, and will increase still further under the&#13;
LVEMP. In addition, knowledge about what kinds of modelling are most useful for&#13;
management have changed in the interim, making it necessary for the model to be re-&#13;
formulated, calibrated, validated, and applied under the project to develop and test&#13;
management strategies for the lake.&#13;
3.27  Implementation of the program will be led by the Ministry of Land Reclamation,&#13;
Regional and Water Development (Kenya), the Ministry of Water (Tanzania), and the&#13;
Directorate of Water Development of the Ministry of Natural Resources in Uganda.&#13;
They will collaborate with the fisheries research institutes, communities, and NGOs in&#13;
the three countries, with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture, Moi University School of Environmental Studies, and the Institute of&#13;
Nuclear Sciences at Nairobi University (Kenya), the Ministry of Natural Resources and&#13;
the University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), and the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Makarere University Departments of Zoology and Chemistry (Uganda). It will be&#13;
financed by GEF (90 percent). The project will finance vehicles and boats; office,&#13;
laboratory and field equipment; laboratory chemicals and reagents; renovation of&#13;
offices, laboratories, and monitoring stations; training and workshops; technical&#13;
assistance; personnel costs, and operation and maintenance expenditures.&#13;
Industrial and Municipal Waste Management [US$9.89 million]&#13;
3.28  This program consists of one core project, namely Management of Industrial and&#13;
Municipal Effluents [US$4.28 million], two pilot projects on Integrated Tertiary&#13;
Municipal Effluent Treatment [US$0.80 million], and Integrated Tertiary Industrial&#13;
Effluent Treatment [US$0.81 million], and a component for Priority Waste Management&#13;
Investments [US$4 million]. The overall aim of the program is to improve management&#13;
of industrial and municipal effluent, and assess the contribution of urban runoff to lake&#13;
pollution in order to design alleviation measures. The program will prepare inventories&#13;
and classifications for all factories and industries in the catchment, assess treatment of&#13;
effluent before discharge and its dilution and dispersion levels in the receiving water&#13;
bodies, quantify pollution and nutrient flows from urban runoff, identify and&#13;
characterise pollution "hot spots", formulate guidelines and effluent discharge&#13;
standards, establish training arrangements for industrialists and local authorities,&#13;
launch a public awareness campaign, and initiate pilot treatment projects in selected&#13;
municipalities and industries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
3.29  The pilot industrial effluent treatment will create "wetlands" to test tertiary&#13;
treatment through filtration of industrial waste from the PanPaper Mill in Webuye&#13;
(Kenya) before it discharges into the Nzoia River, from various industries in Mwanza&#13;
town (Tanzania), and from various industries in Jinja (Uganda). The pilot municipal&#13;
effluent treatment will create "wetlands" to test tertiary treatment through filtration of&#13;
municipal waste in Kisumu (Kenya), Mwanza (Tanzania), and Jinja (Uganda). The&#13;
program of Priority Waste Management Investments will include urgent rehabilitation&#13;
and/or extension of urban sanitation systems which are currently discharging untreated&#13;
waste directly into the lake. Under this sub-component the project wil rehabilitate the&#13;
wastewater treatment works in Kisumu (Kenya), construct a community-based&#13;
simplified sewage scheme in a portion of Mwanza (Tanzania) to complement an&#13;
expansion of the water supply system financed by the EU, improve a sludge disposal&#13;
site in Bukoba (Tanzania), assist the National Water and Sewerage Corporation in&#13;
Uganda to develop a long-term pollution reduction strategy, and modify the main&#13;
effluent discharge into the lake at the Bugolobi treatment works in Kampala (Uganda)&#13;
to increase the detention time of effluent and reduce pollution entering the lake. Details&#13;
of management arrangements for these waste management investments are set out in&#13;
the section on project implementation.&#13;
3.30  Implementation of the program will be led by the Ministry of Land Reclamation,&#13;
Regional and Water Development (Kenya), the Ministry of Water (Tanzania), and the&#13;
Directorate of Water Development of the Ministry of Natural Resources in Uganda.&#13;
They will collaborate with municipal and local councils, and industries in all three&#13;
countries, with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Lake Basin Development&#13;
Authority, and Moi University School of Environmental Studies (Kenya), the University&#13;
of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), and the National Water and Sewerage Corporation&#13;
(NWSC) and Makarere University (Uganda). Postgraduate students from the three&#13;
universities will take up research study areas under this project, and it is envisaged that&#13;
the pilot experiments with artificial wetlands, in particular, will be carried out as&#13;
student research studies. The program will be financed by IDA (90 percent). The&#13;
project will finance vehicles and boats; office, laboratory and field equipment;&#13;
laboratory chemicals and reagents; construction of artificial wetlands; feasibility studies&#13;
and structures for sanitation; training, workshops, and demonstrations; technical&#13;
assistance; personnel costs, and operation and maintenance expenditures.&#13;
Land Use and Wetland Management [US$14.05 million]&#13;
3.31   This program consists of two core projects, namely Management of Pollution&#13;
Loading [US$4.04 million], and Buffering Capacity of Wetlands [US$3.43 million],&#13;
together with four pilot projects: Assessment of the Role of Agro-Chemicals in Pollution&#13;
[US$0.86 million], Integrated Soil and Water Conservation [US$1.49 million],&#13;
Sustainable Use of Wetlands Products [US$1.49 million], and Afforestation [US$2.80&#13;
million]. Building on the last estimates of primary nutrients reaching Lake Victoria&#13;
from its catchment, made in 1979/80 by the Hydromet Project, the pollution loading&#13;
project will establish a water quality monitoring network throughout the catchment,&#13;
estimate the effects of changes in land use planning on pollution loads in lake, and&#13;
develop policies and programs to control non-point source pollution. The second&#13;
project will investigate the buffering processes and capacity of Lake Victoria wetlands,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
and devise a management strategy for them. It will develop an inventory and&#13;
classification of the wetlands, monitor nutrient loading in priority areas, simulate the&#13;
changes of buffering function associated with threats to the wetland resources, assess&#13;
the economic value of buffering functions, and prepare guidelines and investment&#13;
proposals for introducing wastewater into wetlands, as well as rehabilitation and&#13;
artificial wetland construction.&#13;
3.32  The pilot project for agro-chemicals will be implemented on selected sites in the&#13;
Winam Gulf, Nyando and Nzoia catchments in Kenya, the Siniryu catchment near&#13;
Mwanza in Tanzania, and the Kakira sugar estate on the lake shore in Uganda. It will&#13;
carry out inventories of agro-chemicals in the pilot areas, conduct field trials on the fate&#13;
of pesticides and nutrients applied on farms, monitor residues leaching out of the pilot&#13;
catchments, and pesticide levels in receiving rivers, assemble and review a database of&#13;
agro-chemical use in the Lake Victoria Basin, establish arrangements for disseminating&#13;
information to all stakeholders, and mount training courses for extension services on the&#13;
better use of agro-chemicals. The soil conservation pilot will be implemented in the&#13;
catchments of the Simiyu, Nyando, and Kagera Rivers. It will quantify soil erosion and&#13;
nutrient loss from different land covers and uses, design remedial measures and&#13;
sustainable agricultural practices, develop systems to promote soil and water&#13;
conservation, and establish demonstration units to disseminate successful soil and&#13;
water conservation measures. The wetlands pilot project, in selected communities in&#13;
each of the countries, will estimate the economic benefits from wetlands products (fish,&#13;
papyrus, reeds, clay, livestock grazing, and agricultural products), develop management&#13;
strategies for their sustainable use, and for the rehabilitation of specific degraded&#13;
wetlands, evolve strategies for community participation in sustainable use, initiate pilot&#13;
activities to demonstrate this use, and strengthen capacity of local NGOs and CBOs to&#13;
undertake wise use activities. The afforestation pilot project will protect vital parts of&#13;
the lake catchment by planting trees. It will increase awareness among communities on&#13;
catchment protection and tree farming, develop local seed sources, improve&#13;
management of existing forest reserves and create new reserves, and conserve forest&#13;
biodiversity.&#13;
3.33  Implementation of the program will be led by the Ministry of Land Reclamation,&#13;
Regional and Water Development and the Ministry of Agriculture (Kenya), the Ministry&#13;
of Water and Ministry of Agriculture (Tanzania), and the Directorate of Water&#13;
Development of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
(Uganda). They will collaborate with communities, NGOs, and the Ministries or&#13;
Industry and Community Development in all three countries, with the Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Natural Resources, and the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute&#13;
(KARI) (Kenya), the Ministry of Natural Resources, and the Tropical Pesticides Research&#13;
Institute (Tanzania), the Ministry of Environment, and the National Agricultural&#13;
Research Organization (NARO) (Uganda). National wetlands committees in all three&#13;
countries would also be involved in the wetlands components, with assistance from the&#13;
World Conservation Union (IUCN), which would continue to foster regional&#13;
cooperation among the developing national wetlands programs. The sub-components&#13;
for Management of Pollution Loading and Wetland Buffering Capacity will be financed&#13;
by GEF (90 percent), the sub-components for Assessment of the Role of Agro-Chemicals&#13;
in Pollution, Integrated Soil and Water Conservation, and Afforestation will be financed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
by IDA (90 percent), and the sub-component for Sustainable Use of Wetlands Products&#13;
will be financed by both GEF (45 percent) and IDA (45 percent). The project will finance&#13;
vehicles and boats; office, laboratory and field equipment; books and subscriptions to&#13;
journals; laboratory chemicals and reagents; construction of raingauge stations;&#13;
feasibility studies and structures for sanitation; training, workshops, and&#13;
demonstrations; technical assistance; ground and aerial survey work; forestry seedling&#13;
nurseries and creation of reserves; personnel costs, and operation and maintenance&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
Institutional Framework [US$3.98 million]&#13;
3.34  This program consists of three components, namely maintaining the&#13;
coordinating Secretariats [US$2.75 million], support for riparian universities [US$1.06&#13;
million], and preparation of a Pollution Disaster Contingency Plan for the lake [US$0.17&#13;
million]. The three National Secretariats, which have proven successful in coordinating&#13;
project preparation, will be strengthened by adding three positions: a&#13;
Procurement/Disbursement Officer, an Operations Officer, and a Management&#13;
Information Systems Officer. The Secretariats will provide a central contact point and&#13;
information clearing house for all agencies implementing the program, and all donors&#13;
supporting it. While the line agencies will be responsible for progress on their own&#13;
components, and for monitoring and reporting on that progress, the Secretariats will&#13;
gather information from all the agencies in their respective countries, be responsible for&#13;
overall monitoring, and prepare progress reports for decision making about the overall&#13;
project. They will ensure compliance with IDA and GEF reporting, procurement and&#13;
disbursement procedures (see the Project Implementation Plan, Annex 3). The Heads of&#13;
the Secretariats will, when necessary, organize tripartite meetings of officials&#13;
responsible for various components of the program. The Regional Secretariat in&#13;
Tanzania will organize meetings, when required, of members of the Regional Policy and&#13;
Steering Committee. This management and coordination component will be financed&#13;
by GEF (90 percent). The project will finance vehicles; office equipment; regional and&#13;
national meetings and workshops; technical assistance; personnel costs, and operation&#13;
and maintenance expenditures.&#13;
3.35  The component for the riparian universities will strengthen facilities for&#13;
environmental analysis and graduate teaching at Moi University School of&#13;
Environmental Studies (Department of Fisheries), at the University of Dar es Salaam&#13;
(Department of Zoology), and at Makarere University (Department of Zoology). The&#13;
component will be financed by GEF (90 percent). The project will finance vehicles and&#13;
boats; office and laboratory equipment, chemicals and reagents; books and subscriptions&#13;
to journals; and operation and maintenance expenditures.&#13;
3.36  Under the guidance cf the Regional Secretariat in Tanzania, consultants&#13;
preparing the Pollution Disaster Contingency Plan will draw up an inventory of&#13;
hazards, hazardous sites, and vulnerable water uses and sites; review safety regulations;&#13;
assess available facilities and planning provisions to deal with emergencies; implement&#13;
a public education program, establish early warning systems, and develop a Regional&#13;
Disaster Plan and Protocol to be agreed by the three governments. The component will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
be financed by GEF (90 percent). The project will finance technical assistance to&#13;
undertake a pollution disaster study and prepare a contingency plan.&#13;
D.    PROJECT PRIORMIES&#13;
3.37 In this project the individual components fit together like a web, as befits a&#13;
package of measures which addresses comprehensively the problems in an inter-&#13;
connected ecosystem. Almost all components will contain a mixture of information-&#13;
gathering, capacity building, and concrete actions to address the lake's problems. Much&#13;
of the information-gathering will follow an adaptive environmental management&#13;
approach, which involves learning by doing and adjusting or adapting management&#13;
actions based on results. It is not easy, therefore, to separate actions from knowledge-&#13;
building. It will be important for all components to be implemented from the&#13;
beginning, and in all three countries simultaneously, at a comparable pace.&#13;
3.38  Project investments do, however, comprise a mix of activities in pilot zones, and&#13;
activities carried out on a lake-wide basis. What is sequenced in the project is not the&#13;
actions, themselves, but the pilot zones in which they are carried out. In the first year of&#13;
the project, actions will be implemented in three pilot zones: Nyakach Bay in Kenya,&#13;
Mwanza Gulf in Tanzania, and Napoleon Gulf in Uganda. Thereafter, groups of pilot&#13;
zones will be phased in until by the end of the project actions will have been carried out&#13;
in all 14 designated pilot zones. If there were to be funding crises, the response would&#13;
be to postpone the work in the pilot zones planned for the outer years of the project. In&#13;
this way the essential core of lake-wide activities would be preserved, as well as the&#13;
coordinated nature of the adaptive environmental management approach in at least a&#13;
sub-set of the pilot areas. Upon resolution of any funding crisis, work would be&#13;
resumed with minimum disruption to progress.&#13;
E.    PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
Cost Estimates&#13;
3.39  The total cost of the project, including physical and price contingencies, is&#13;
estimated at US$77.58 million, as outlined in the table below. Project costs are shown in&#13;
US Dollars, because three different domestic currencies are involved.&#13;
Financing&#13;
3.40  The three governments would contribute US$7.6 million to the project, leaving&#13;
US$70 million to be covered by donors. Incremental costs financed by the GEF amount&#13;
to US$35 million. The remaining project costs would be financed by IDA with an&#13;
allocation of US$35 million (Table 3.2).&#13;
GEF Incremental Costs&#13;
3.41  Incremental costs of the project under GEF definitions are estimated to be&#13;
US$38.8 million (details in Annex 7). In addition to financing the baseline and adjusted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
baseline measures from non-GEF (IDA) sources, the three riparian governments have&#13;
agreed to contribute US$3.8 million from their own resources to finance a part of the&#13;
project's incremental cost. They have requested a GEF grant of US$35 million to fund&#13;
the balance.&#13;

F.     RATIONALE FOR GEF AND IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.42   Lake Victoria is an international water body that is both of great economic worth&#13;
to the three riparian countries and of great scientific and cultural significance to the&#13;
global community, mainly in respect of its unique waterborne biodiversity. It is&#13;
suffering severely from three of the four major global environment concerns highlighted&#13;
in the GEF Operational Strategy for International Waters - degradation of water quality&#13;
due to pollution from land-based activities; introduction of non-indigenous species; and&#13;
excessive exploitation of living resources. It is also facing their typical consequences -&#13;
potentially irreversible environmental damage, hardship to the poor and serious health&#13;
concerns. With poverty endemic to the region and many competing claims for scarce&#13;
development resources, the case for GEF-support to overcome the barriers to concerted&#13;
corrective action is extremely strong. As called for in the operational strategy, the GEF&#13;
assistance will act as a catalyst for the three countries to develop a better understanding&#13;
of how the lake functions, learn how the actions of their populations in the lake basin&#13;
affect the lake environment, and work out ways jointly with one another to implement a&#13;
comprehensive approach to managing the lake ecosystem to achieve global&#13;
environment benefits. The project is consistent with both the GEF waterbody-based&#13;
operational program and with the integrated land and water operational program,&#13;
while also having elements of the third, contaminant-based, operational program. The&#13;
project will in particular address another priority in the operational strategy - the&#13;
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems. As one of&#13;
the world's largest unique freshwater biodiversity habitats, Lake Victoria is a clear&#13;
priority for GEF assistance.&#13;
3.43   The GEF funding for this project will make possible the elaboration of a strategic&#13;
framework for a large program of investments in the lake basin during the project&#13;
implementation period, particularly in municipal waste management and soil&#13;
conservation, and will also lay the foundation for a longer program of investments over&#13;
time in these and other areas. It will thus have an enormous "leveraging" impact, for&#13;
the benefit of the national and global environments. The GEF financing of preparation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
succeeded in generating strong "ownership" of the project by the three governments&#13;
which prepared it, and catalysed close collaboration at every stage among IDA, FAO,&#13;
UNDP and UNEP. The information and pilot work carried out in the GEF project&#13;
would orient ongoing investments and guide new ones during its five years of&#13;
implementation, and far beyond. Within the next two years, under projects already&#13;
begun, IDA and the European Union would finance improvements to municipal sewage&#13;
treatment schemes in Kampala and Jinja in Uganda, and Mwanza in Tanzania. The&#13;
funds would also finance a study of storm water drainage, solid waste management,&#13;
and water reticulation in Kampala.&#13;
3.44  Several other major infrastructure projects are planned to begin implementation&#13;
in FY98 which would finance water supply and urban sanitation in the lake basin,&#13;
directly in support of the LVEMP. Further projects are planned to support natural&#13;
resource management in the lake basin, including soil conservation and catchment&#13;
afforestation. All of these projects will reduce pollution and eutrophication in the lake.&#13;
While most of these projects were identified initially in the absence of the LVEMP, the&#13;
latter will increase markedly the success with which they address the priority issues.&#13;
The major projects still forthcoming will "take their signals" from the framework and&#13;
findings of the LVEMP. Numerous smaller scale activities with bilateral support,&#13;
implemented by local communities and NGOs, will also benefit from being planned in&#13;
the context of the improved information base and management plans designed for the&#13;
ecosystem as a whole, which will result from the LVEMP.&#13;
3.45  The project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for&#13;
each of the three countries. The CAS for Kenya was discussed by the Board on January&#13;
31, 1996. One of the key elements of the strategy is to improve environmental&#13;
management within the country, and to assist Kenya to respond to its commitments to&#13;
enhance protection of the global environment. The CAS for Uganda was discussed by&#13;
the Board on June 1, 1995. An important element of that strategy is to build domestic&#13;
environmental management capacity, and in particular to address issues related to&#13;
degradation of Lake Victoria. The CAS for Tanzania was discussed by the Board in&#13;
March 1994, and a Progress Report was discussed by the Board on May 23,1996. IDA&#13;
financial support for the project is in line with two primary aims of the CAS, namely&#13;
capacity building for improved public sector management, and creating a climate for&#13;
environmentally sustainable investments.&#13;
3.46  The project would be the first substantial investment in the environment for IDA&#13;
in two of the three countries following preparation of National Environmental Action&#13;
Plans in all three. Various other donors have supported a range of initiatives in and&#13;
around Lake Victoria, in smaller, uncoordinated, and sometimes incomplete ways. In&#13;
the absence of a coordinated management system for the entire lake and its ecosystem,&#13;
these smaller projects have sometimes fallen short, and continue to fall short, of&#13;
realizing their maximum potential. Building on its wide-ranging relationships with all&#13;
three governments, IDA has an important capability, and as implementing donor in this&#13;
project an important opportunity, to support the development of such a coordinated&#13;
management system. IDA also has the standing to mobilize scientific resources from&#13;
across the globe in support of an initiative which has unprecedented interest to the&#13;
global scientific community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
G.    LESSONS LEARNED AND TECHNICAL REVIEW&#13;
3.47  This program would be the first of its kind within the region, addressing a&#13;
complex set of managerial, scientific/technical and institutional issues across three&#13;
countries. It would aim to provide Governments with the necessary skills, information,&#13;
technical and financial resources, and a proper institutional and legal framework to&#13;
carry out successfully such an endeavor. It would build technical capacity to promote,&#13;
assist and coordinate the various initiatives within a regional framework, and help&#13;
design a comprehensive set of national policies and strategies based on lessons learned&#13;
from field experience. An important lesson incorporated from past operations was to&#13;
ensure that preparation be done by the countries themselves. The resultant ownership&#13;
will have the usual national benefits, as well as being especially important in this&#13;
program which crosses national boundaries, since the three governments have already&#13;
gained valuable experience working together during preparation.&#13;
3.48  The present report has responded to the GEF Technical Review of the project by&#13;
acknowledging the uncertainty about sources and mechanics of eutrophication,&#13;
incorporating the specific management elements suggested by the reviewer, setting the&#13;
stage for a new approach to modelling, reiterating the emphasis on managenent of the&#13;
lake's problems as the aim of everything in the project, and delineating the project's&#13;
large elements of capacity building.&#13;
4.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE&#13;
4.1   The Tripartite Agreement (signed August 5,1994) which set in motion a&#13;
collaborative process of project preparation among the three countries, provided also for&#13;
project implementation. In particular it established three National Secretariats, each&#13;
headed by a high-level officer, selected by the respective governments, and supported&#13;
by a modest staff. These Secretariats served an essential coordination role during&#13;
project preparation, and it is planned that this role should continue into the project&#13;
implementation phase. They would be strengthened by the appointment of an&#13;
Procurement/Disbursement Officer, an Operations Officer, and a Management&#13;
Information Systems Officer. Among other things, these three officers would ensure&#13;
compliance with IDA and GEF reporting, procurement and disbursement procedures&#13;
(see the Project Implementation Plan, Annex 3). The three Secretariats, one in each&#13;
country, would provide a day-to-day central contact point and information clearing&#13;
house for all agencies implementing the program, and all donors supporting it. While&#13;
the many implementing agencies would be responsible for progress on their own&#13;
components, and for monitoring and reporting on that progress, the Secretariats would&#13;
gather information from all the agencies in their respective countries, be responsible for&#13;
overall monitoring, and prepare progress reports for decision making about the overall&#13;
project. The Heads of the Secretariats would also, when necessary, organize tripartite&#13;
meetings of officials responsible for various components of the program. The Regional&#13;
Secretariat in Tanzania would organize meetings, when required, of members of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Regional Policy and Steering Committee, which would also remain in place, with the&#13;
same membership as it has had throughout project preparation. The Committee would&#13;
have many roles, its most important being the mechanism for resolution of disputes&#13;
arising during implementation of the program.&#13;
4.2   The Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization would assume overall coordination&#13;
for components associated with fisheries, although as the project description outlines,&#13;
implementation would be by individual national agencies, and the Regional Policy and&#13;
Steering Committee would be responsible for overall program coordination, including&#13;
coordination between the fisheries program as a whole and the rest of the program.&#13;
B.   IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES&#13;
4.3   The various national agencies would implement components of the projects as&#13;
follows. The three Fisheries Research Institutes (KEMFRI, TAFIRI and FIRI) would play&#13;
lead roles in all sub-components of fisheries research, and would collaborate with the&#13;
Fisheries Departments of their respective governments in the fisheries extension, and&#13;
with the Ministries of Water in the Water Quality components. For the latter&#13;
components, the Ministries of Water would be the lead agencies, and they in turn would&#13;
collaborate closely with the Ministries of Environment, Natural Resources and&#13;
Agriculture in their implementation of the components on land use and wetland&#13;
management. National wetlands conmmittees in all three countries would also be&#13;
involved in these components, with continuing assistance from the World Conservation&#13;
UInion (IUCN). The Moi, Makarere, and Sokoine Universities, and the Universities of&#13;
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, would be involved in many of the studies, including those&#13;
on socio-economics. The water testing laboratories of the Kisumu and Mwanza&#13;
Municipal Councils, the Uganda Water and Sewage Corporation, and the Lake Basin&#13;
Development Authority (in Kisumu) would extend the reach of laboratories already&#13;
operating or planned by the respective Ministries of Water.&#13;
4.4  In order to address the variations in implementation capacity, from country to&#13;
country, and agency to agency, with some strong already but others less so, every sub-&#13;
program makes extensive provision for capacity building. For the whole project in the&#13;
three countries provision is made for more than 2,000 short term and on-job training&#13;
courses, about 100 regional Masters Degrees, and 15 PhDs. Care will be taken to strike a&#13;
balance in the training and its timing so that enough people are available to implement&#13;
the project.&#13;
4.5   For the Water Hyacinth Control Program, national steering committees or task&#13;
forces will be set up, and rearing units for biological control agents will be established&#13;
by the respective national agricultural research institutes. Finally, the project will also&#13;
draw on the resources of local and international consultants in areas where particular&#13;
scientific expertise is called for beyond the abilities of staff in the implementing&#13;
Ministries.&#13;
4.6   Because of the extensive scientific investments in the program, the worldwide&#13;
scientific interest in Lake Victoria, the need to seek innovative solutions to solving&#13;
environmental problems that draw on a broad spectrum of physical, biological and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
social sciences, and uncertainties associated with the dynamic lake ecosystem, it is also&#13;
proposed to appoint a high level panel of internationally renowned scientists, initially&#13;
with 7 members, to serve as an overall advisory group for the scientific studies in the&#13;
lake. Possible scientific specialties for representation on the panel will be limnology,&#13;
fish biology, zoology, entomology, plant physiology, microbiology, chemistry,&#13;
meteorology, economics, anthropology, sociology, soil chemistry and physics, forestry,&#13;
and ecology. The panel will contain at least three members representing the natural&#13;
sciences and at least two from the social sciences, and its membership will be reviewed&#13;
every two years, although members may serve unlimited terms upon reappointment by&#13;
the nominating agencies. Following each two-yearly review, the panel will elect from&#13;
among its members a corresponding secretary to facilitate communication within the&#13;
panel. The panel members will be mutually acceptable to the three riparian states (as&#13;
represented by the Regional Policy and Steering Committee) and to IDA.&#13;
4.7   The main aim of the Panel of Scientists will be to help ensure maximum benefits&#13;
to the riparian states from activities of the international scientific cornmunity, by&#13;
providing a means for improving the coordination of such activities and increasing their&#13;
contribution to specific capacity budding and problem solving in the lake basin. They&#13;
will act as a standing committee of technical expertise to whom task and project&#13;
managers under the LVEMP may refer technical issues and reports for comment and&#13;
advice back to the referring managers. They will keep an up-to-date inventory of&#13;
international, externally funded scientific research pertinent to LVEMP programs.&#13;
Using electronic media such as the World Wide Web, they will keep the international&#13;
scientific community informed about outstanding research issues being addressed by&#13;
the LVEMP, in order to focus and mobilize that international community. They will&#13;
help to identify intemational training opportunities for researchers from the riparian&#13;
countries, and encourage the formation of partnerships and consortia between regional&#13;
universities and the international community of universities. They will meet once a&#13;
year to review issues arising from project implementation, and could meet at other&#13;
times if required, as well as being available individually, at the request of the Regional&#13;
Policy and Steering Committee, to provide advice about specific issues.&#13;
C.    SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.8   The project provides funds totalling about US$3 million for the three countries to&#13;
support micro-projects in selected fishing communities. These will comprise small&#13;
investments, costing up to US$15,000 each, in community water supply from ground-&#13;
water, sanitary facilities, local roads, health facilities, and seed funds for assisting&#13;
fishing communities to adjust to new regulations such as those related to fishing net&#13;
mesh sizes. These micro-projects will address concerns directly related to the fisheries&#13;
management and water quality emphases of the project, while providing incentives for&#13;
communities to participate in components of the project across the board. The funds for&#13;
these micro-projects will flow through the regional administrations, overseen by the&#13;
Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife in Kenya, the Vice President's Office in Tanzania, and&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries in Uganda.&#13;
4.9   The three Ministries responsible will each prepare an Operational Manual to&#13;
guide all micro-project activities. It will contain, inter alia, criteria for identification,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
appraisal, implementation, supervision, monitoring and evaluation, reporting and&#13;
accounting requirements, sample contracting documents, standard forms for processing,&#13;
technical data on infrastructure projects, and procedures for carrying out environmental&#13;
assessments. An Evaluation Committee will be established in each of the three&#13;
Ministries, which will approve/reject project proposals from the regional offices. In the&#13;
regional offices, the proposed projects will be screened by Project Officers who will&#13;
assess the impact on the community and on special groups (e.g. poorer women), likely&#13;
returns on investment, factors affecting effective use and sustainability, satisfaction of&#13;
technical standards, sensitivity to environmental goals, realism of costs, arrangements&#13;
for implementation and supervision, and commitment of beneficiaries to maintenance&#13;
(recurrent costs may be covered by allocation on the regional government approved&#13;
budget).&#13;
4.10   Micro-projects must have at least 10 percent community cost-sharing, in the form&#13;
of a financial contribution or through labor and materials. When micro-projects have&#13;
been approved, the central Ministry will prepare a disbursement schedule, bidding&#13;
documents, arrangements for procurement and contracts, review cost estimates, and&#13;
sign a Financing Agreement with the respective Community Project Committee.&#13;
Implementation of projects may be through self-help, by a Village Council or its&#13;
Commnunity Committee, by private contractors answering to the Community&#13;
Conmmittee, by Local Government Construction Units, or by an NGO contracted as a&#13;
Collaborating Agency. While Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) will, in general,&#13;
be preferred as implementing agencies, if NGOs are selected for implementation or to&#13;
provide technical assistance they will be selected competitively by shortlisting several&#13;
qualified NGOs, following IDA guidelines for use of consultants. Non-standard draft&#13;
contracts between the administering Ministries and NGOs will be subject to review and&#13;
"no objection" by IDA. Sole source selection of NGOs will be considered where justified&#13;
by circumstances.&#13;
4.11 Funds will flow from a line budget in the administering Ministries, through the&#13;
District Program Coordinators who will have an Authority to Incur Expenditure (AIE).&#13;
Full authority for procurement of goods and services (which will follow normal&#13;
government procedures satisfactory to IDA) will be vested in the districts. These&#13;
include shopping and local bidding procedures and/or direct contracting where the&#13;
first two methods are not feasible. Each micro-project will be supported by a technical&#13;
proposal, basic financial analysis and budget approved by the District Steering Group,&#13;
summarized in a sanction letter to be signed by the District Program Coordinator.&#13;
4.12  The priority waste nanagenent investmnents will be designed and implemented&#13;
under the project. During the first two years the project will finance detailed design&#13;
work for rehabilitating the existing wastewater treatment plant in Kisumu (Kenya), a&#13;
simplified sewerage system for a portion of Mwanza (Tanzania), improvements in&#13;
sludge disposal in Bukoba (Tanzania), and civil works on the main effluent discharge at&#13;
the Bugolobi treatment works in Kampala (Uganda). In addition, during the first two&#13;
years, the project will finance development of a long term pollution reduction strategy&#13;
by the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) in Uganda. In the third and&#13;
fourth years of the project, the civil works in Kisumu, Mwanza, Bukoba, and at the&#13;
Bugolobi treatment works will be constructed. Engagement of consultants to prepare&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
the detailed designs and the strategy, and contracting of civil works, will follow&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA as set out in the section on Procurement.&#13;
D.   IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW&#13;
4.13 As they collaborated during project preparation, IDA, UNDP, and UNEP will&#13;
also collaborate during reviews of implementation. IDA will have overall responsibility&#13;
for review, UNDP will focus on stakeholder consultation and participation aspects of&#13;
the project, and UNEP will focus on water quality aspects of the project As part of the&#13;
Mid-Term Review of the project (by March 1999), the three governments will prepare an&#13;
updated analysis of transboundary environmental concerns, to guide the second phase&#13;
of project implementation, and set the stage for subsequent initiatives. The&#13;
Implementation Completion Report prepared by the three governments at the end of&#13;
the project will include a revised Strategic Action Program, containing an outline of&#13;
interventions needed to address priority problems. IDA will use this as the basis for&#13;
convening a donors' meeting to seek commitments to support such interventions.&#13;
E.    PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.14  The entities responsible for coordinating program implementation and&#13;
procurement will be the LVEMP National Secretariats in the respective countries, the&#13;
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources in Kenya, the Ministry of Natural&#13;
Resources in Uganda, and the Department of Environment in the Vice President's Office&#13;
in Tanzania. They would consult with the implementing sector Ministries and their&#13;
research organizations dealing with water, fisheries, and agriculture. Each&#13;
implementing agency wir be responsible for procurement for the project components&#13;
assigned to it. The Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization (LVFO) will be the&#13;
implementing and procuring agency for its activities.&#13;
4.15 IDA Guidelines for Procurement (1995) and IDA Guidelines for Use of&#13;
Consultants (1981) will be followed for all project components funded by the IDA&#13;
Credits and the GEF Grants. The Bank's Standard Documents for Procurement of&#13;
Goods (1995) and the Bank's Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services (1995)&#13;
will be used for all procurement under International Competitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures and consultancy contracts for Technical Assistance, respectively. Before&#13;
commencing procurement under National Competitive Bidding (NCB), and prior to&#13;
Credit Effectiveness, draft bidding documents will be finalised in consultation with&#13;
IDA. Standard bid evaluation reports developed by IDA will be used in presenting&#13;
evaluation reports to IDA.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
4.16  As part of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP), a procurement plan for major&#13;
contracts has been prepared for the project. Standard procurement processing times for&#13;
key activities were agreed with each of the participating Governments at negotiations.&#13;
4.17  Procurement of works, goods and services for all IDA/GEF financed&#13;
components will be coordinated centrally in each country by its LVEMP National&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
Secretariat (LVEMP), but processing of bidding documents will be handled by the&#13;
sectoral ministry/agency in charge of project implementation. However, in the case of&#13;
common items such as vehicles, motor cycles, and office equipment, procurement will&#13;
be "bulked" at the national level. Procurement of these "bulked items" will be&#13;
processed by the LVEMP National Secretariats in each country. The National Secretariat&#13;
in each of the participating countries will be strengthened for this purpose by the&#13;
addition of a qualified procurement/disbursement specialist familiar with International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) and procurement procedures.&#13;
4.18  The Category of Works includes civil works, on a pilot scale, for creation of&#13;
tertiary "wetlands" to test the treatment of municipal effluent using a system which&#13;
could be later adopted on a larger scale. The works would include design of the&#13;
"wetland", construction of diversion channels, pipes, sluice valves, gates, platforms,&#13;
access road(s), environmental protection works, and land development works. No ICB&#13;
procurement of works is foreseen due to the small scale of construction at dispersed&#13;
locations (contracts ranging from US$5,000 to US$100,000). Ministries that do not have&#13;
the required technical expertise will engage consultants to design and supervise civil&#13;
work contracts. Contracts for goods, including vehicles and equipment would be&#13;
grouped into packages of US$100,000 or more wherever practicable, and procured&#13;
through ICB.&#13;
4.19   Prior Review. All procurement packages for civil works, goods, supplies,&#13;
materials and maintenance contracts with an estimated contract value above US$100,000&#13;
will be subject to IDA's prior review, in accordance with Appendix 1 of the IDA&#13;
Guidelines. All consulting contracts with firms with a contract value above US$100,000&#13;
or with individual consultants with a contract value above US$50,000 will be subject to&#13;
IDA's prior review. In addition, all terms of reference for proposed consulting&#13;
assignments will be subject to IDA's prior review.&#13;
4.20  In order to ensure that appropriate procedures are being followed, the first three&#13;
contracts for goods, civil works, and consultancies, irrespective of contract value, will be&#13;
subject to IDA prior review. During supervision missions, IDA will review one in five&#13;
randomly selected contracts which are below these prior review thresholds.&#13;
4.21   Procurement Methods. The procurement of vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles,&#13;
office equipment, and supplies will be carried out in reasonable packages of similar&#13;
goods under the following procedures (aggregate amounts for non-ICB procedures are&#13;
shown in the respective procurement table for each participating Government, for the&#13;
GEF Grant and the IDA Credit):&#13;
* International Competitive Bidding (ICB), if the esfimated contract value per&#13;
package is more than US$100,000;&#13;
* National Competitive Bidding (NCB), if the estimated contract value per&#13;
package is more than US$50,000 but less than US$100,000;&#13;
* International Shopping Procedures (ISP) in accordance with Section III of&#13;
the IDA guidelines, on the basis of at least three quotations from reputable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
suppliers in two different countries, if the estimated cost per package is&#13;
more than US$20,000 but less than US$50,000; as an alternative to ISP, Inter-&#13;
Agency Procurement Services Office (IAPSO) procurement procedures may&#13;
be followed;&#13;
*  National Shopping Procedures (NSP) in accordance with Section III of the&#13;
IDA Guidelines, on the basis of at least three quotations from local&#13;
suppliers, if the estimated cost per package is less than US$20,000;&#13;
*  The aggregate amounts for ISP and NSP, respectively, would be 60 percent&#13;
and 40 percent of the Category "Other" for each GEF Grant and IDA Credit.&#13;
4.22   Technical Assistance Consultancies. The selection of consultants to provide&#13;
technical assistance will be carried out according to IDA Guidelines, including&#13;
shortlisting, letters of invitation and evaluation of technical and price proposals.&#13;
General procurement notices issued annually will highlight major consulting&#13;
assignments, which will assist in establishment of shortlists. Selections for short-term&#13;
assignments and the selection of individual consultants for contracts below the prior&#13;
review threshold will follow procedures specified in Section V of the IDA guidelines.&#13;
4.23 The selection of NGOs to provide Technical Assistance will be competitive&#13;
through shortlisting of several qualified NGOs, and otherwise will follow IDA&#13;
Guidelines for Use of Consultants.&#13;
4.24 Training. Each implementing department and agency will prepare an annual&#13;
trairnng plan and submit it to the respective LVEMP National Secretariat. The training&#13;
program will identify the subjects and courses for training, their timing, duration,&#13;
estimated costs, name and location of the training institutions, the names of the persons&#13;
proposed, and the justification for their training. The training plans will be submitted to&#13;
IDA for approval, the first within three months of Credit Effectiveness, and subsequent&#13;
annual plans prior to the commencement of each fiscal year.&#13;
4.25   Procurement Monitoring. During project implementation the LVEMP National&#13;
Secretariats will provide quarterly reports on progress of procurement highlighting&#13;
difficulties encountered in the past, and how they would be addressed in the future to&#13;
ensure timely project completion.&#13;
F.    DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.26 The proposed IDA Credits, respectively of SDR 8.9 million for Kenya, SDR 7.0&#13;
million for Tanzania, and SDR 8.4 million for Uganda, the proposed GEF Grants,&#13;
respectively of SDR 8.0 million for Kenya, SDR 7.2 million for Tanzania, and SDR 9.2&#13;
million for Uganda, would be disbursed over a period of 6 years with an expected&#13;
project completion date of June 30, 2002, and a closing date of December 31, 2002. The&#13;
schedule of estimated disbursements is in Annex 2.&#13;
4.27 Disbursement Procedures: Disbursements from the IDA Credit will be in&#13;
accordance with normal IDA procedures set out in the Disbursement Handbook&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
(November 1992). Once agreement has been reached on the annual work program and&#13;
budgets with the respective implementing agencies, that is the LVEMP National&#13;
Secretariats and the focal Ministries in each country, or the LVFO as the case may be,&#13;
disbursements from the credit will be made following the standard procedures,&#13;
including: reimbursement of expenses incurred by the LVEMP National Secretariat, the&#13;
Ministries of Environment and Natural Resources, or the LVFO (as the case may be)&#13;
against submission of disbursement requests, direct payment to suppliers or&#13;
replenishment of special accounts.&#13;
4.28  To facilitate disbursement, IDA will advance a sum of US$500,000 for the Lake&#13;
Victoria Environmental Management Program to the LVEMP National Secretariats in&#13;
each of the three countries into Special Accounts in US Dollars to be opened with a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to IDA. Upon effectiveness the advance amounts will be&#13;
deposited to the Special Account and subsequent amounts deposited against&#13;
disbursement application(s). Replenishment applications for the Special Accounts&#13;
would be submitted monthly or whenever the Special Account balances are reduced by&#13;
one third, whichever comes first. The account may be used to pay for expenditures in&#13;
either local currency or foreign exchange through the commercial banking system,&#13;
against any category of expenditure. All replenishments should be fully documented&#13;
except in the case where statements of expenditure (SOEs) are authorized.&#13;
4.29   Disbursements by IDA against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs): the respective&#13;
project implementing agencies may claim reimbursements on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditures (SOEs) for:&#13;
(a)   Goods costing less than US$100,000 equivalent.&#13;
(b)   Consultant contracts, costing less than US$100,000 equivalent for firms,&#13;
and less than US$50,000 for individuals.&#13;
(c)   All local training, workshops and studies.&#13;
(d)   All training costs less than US$10,000, and all operating costs.&#13;
The respective implementing agency will retain all the relevant supporting&#13;
documentation for reimbursements of SOEs for inspection by IDA. During the course of&#13;
the annual audit of the project accounts, the auditors will certify that all expenditures&#13;
claimed under SOEs have been properly incurred for the project.&#13;
G.    ACCOUNTING AND AUDrrS&#13;
4.30  A single set of consolidated accounts will be prepared for each component under&#13;
the program. For preparation of the component accounts, and records of project&#13;
activities, including SOE's and the Special Account in accordance with sound&#13;
accounting practices, responsibility will rest on the accountants appointed for this&#13;
purpose under the program (in the LVEMP National Secretariats and the LVFO when&#13;
established) under the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources in Kenya, the&#13;
Vice President's Office in Tanzania, and the Ministry of Natural Resources in Uganda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Governments will have the&#13;
records and accounts of the Project, including the Special Accounts and SOEs, audited&#13;
for every fiscal year, by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and that it will submit&#13;
the audit reports to IDA within six months of the end of every fiscal year, with a&#13;
separate opinion by the auditors on SOEs.&#13;
4.31 Foreign exchange Special Accounts will be established by each country for the&#13;
program with an international commercial bank of good repute, on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA. Upon credit effectiveness an initial deposit of US$0.5&#13;
million would be made into the Special Account of the Lake Victoria Environmental&#13;
Management Program in each country, representing about four months of IDA/GEF&#13;
disbursements. Operation of these Special Accounts will follow IDA procedures, and&#13;
the account will be replenished oit the basis of regular monthly applications from the&#13;
LVEMP Secretariat or the LVFO, documenting expenditures from the account.&#13;
H.   SUSTAINABILITY AND PARTICIPATION&#13;
4.32  The two most important elements of sustainability are stakeholder ownership,&#13;
and provision for fiscal continuance. They have been addressed by a highly&#13;
participatory mode of project preparation, and will be addressed during&#13;
implementation by special efforts to involve local communities, and support for a&#13;
Fisheries Levy Trust study to seek sources of funds for ongoing support for lake&#13;
ecosystem activities.&#13;
4.33  Catalyzed by GEF financing, the three governments prepared the project&#13;
themselves, in the process resolving many issues among them, demonstrating good&#13;
technical collaboration, and generating strong ownership for the implementation phase.&#13;
The Tripartite Agreement signed in August 1994 covered both preparation and&#13;
implementation, thus providing for the implementation phase a continuing legal&#13;
framework which has already been tested and found sound. Institutional arrangements&#13;
which have proved their worth during preparation - especially the structure of National&#13;
Secretariats and a joint Policy Steering Committee - will be continued unchanged for&#13;
implementation, except that the Secretariats will be strengthened by the addition of&#13;
specialized personnel.&#13;
4.34  Supported by the UNDP, special efforts during preparation were made in all&#13;
three countries to involve communities around the lake in generation and discussion of&#13;
project proposals, along with information-gathering to ensure that project proposals&#13;
address the needs of local communities. In all three countries consultants were engaged&#13;
who visited communities, women's groups, projects of community-based organisations&#13;
and NGOs in fisheries and fish processing, soil conservation, wetlands development,&#13;
and water hyacinth control, among many others. In Tanzania, for example, a study of&#13;
community needs was conducted in three regions, 12 districts, 24 fishing villages and&#13;
more than 85 groups or communities. The consultants also worked with NGOs and&#13;
others to conduct stakeholder workshops, and with the government working groups to&#13;
incorporate a community focus into the preparation report. The large emphasis on&#13;
fisheries extension is one of many outcomes of this process. Others include the&#13;
provision for community micro-projects among the investments which the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
supports, and the proposals for community involvement in many of the research&#13;
programs to be conducted under the project. The government preparation report&#13;
acknowledges that "one of the major setbacks in aquatic resource management in East&#13;
Africa is the general lack of community participation in management programs", and&#13;
notes that such participation "is considered key to the successful implementation of this&#13;
program.&#13;
4.35 Throughout the project special efforts will be made to involve local communities,&#13;
and the capacity of a number of local NGOs and CBOs will be strengthened so that they&#13;
can facilitate the process of community participation and ownership, and lead the&#13;
communities in undertaking wise use activities of the resources in the lake and its basin.&#13;
A special feature of the Fish Biology and Biodiversity Conservation program&#13;
implementation, for example, will be attempts to involve local communities in&#13;
identification of issues, tagging and recapture efforts, return of immature fish,&#13;
surveillance of protected areas, sampling of commercial catches, protection of research&#13;
equipment, and compilation of research data. Many of the other scientific initiatives&#13;
will involve communities in carrying out the measurements, and in caring for&#13;
monitoring equipment. For the water hyacinth control program, in particular, it will be&#13;
essential for local people to understand and assist with the biological control efforts.&#13;
4.36  The project has community participation woven into virtually every component,&#13;
funding for micro-projects, a great deal of community training, financing for hundreds&#13;
of stakeholder workshops, and provision for community participation in everything&#13;
from scientific studies to water hyacinth control, fisheries research to own-enforcement&#13;
of agreed fishery regulations, sustainable use of wetlands to soil conservation, with&#13;
benefits springing from better fishing management, aquaculture, higher quality&#13;
products, lower post-harvest losses, cleaner water, more control over local fishing&#13;
beaches, and coiistruction of community assets.&#13;
4.37 Acknowledging that availability of reliable and adequate funding is essential for&#13;
management of fisheries, which involves continuing research, extension, monitoring&#13;
and enforcement, the three governments have proposed to study and implement jointly&#13;
a program in which funds raised from the commercial fisheries themselves would&#13;
contribute to underwriting fisheries management in the longer term, as well as assisting&#13;
some of the central monitoring and management initiatives to become fiscally&#13;
sustainable. The study will identify sources of funds, and also examine in depth the&#13;
issues involved in managing such funds on a regional basis. The LVEMP includes&#13;
financial support for establishing a shared Levy Trust Fund among the three countries,&#13;
should the study show this to be feasible.&#13;
I.    MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.38  The project is designed to be a mixture of information-gathering, capacity-&#13;
building, institution establishment, and actions to deal with the environmental&#13;
problems of the lake and its catchment, with an emphasis on fisheries management,&#13;
water hyacinth control, improving water quality, and land use management (including&#13;
wetlands). A central concem is to reduce the flow of nutrients and pollutants into the&#13;
lake, and reverse some of the adverse environmental developments of the past. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
project will attempt to lay the foundations in these areas, and provide a "central core"&#13;
around which will coalesce a larger program of investments to clean up the lake, and&#13;
establish sustainable development of the lake and its catchment in the face of the&#13;
growing population pressures likely to be experienced.&#13;
4.39  It will be difficult to isolate and measure the project's impact on development in&#13;
the lake and its catchment. Although there are some specific characteristics of the lake&#13;
which can be measured - water quality, fisheries yield, and ecological stability - the lack&#13;
of reliable historic data will make it hard to calculate in an exact way the extent to which&#13;
the LVEMP itself is responsible for changes noted, since these have to be considered&#13;
against some prediction of what would have happened without the project.&#13;
4.40   Monitoring of the lake catchment and of the LVEMP will focus on measuring the&#13;
state of the lake (water quality, fish stocks, and species richness) and measuring (or&#13;
estimating) changes in the inputs to the system (such as fishing effort, and loads of key&#13;
pollutants). Specific indicators of project impact will include (a) reductions in the&#13;
nutrient and fecal coliform counts from towns bordering the lake; (b) reductions in&#13;
sediment and phosphorus loading in rivers flowing into the lake; (c) reductions by at&#13;
least 50 percent over five years in significant industrial pollutants entering the lake; (d)&#13;
stabilizing the Nile perch catch at least at current levels, and increasing the recovery of&#13;
other species; (e) measurable reduction in the infestation of water hyacinth; and (f)&#13;
stabilization of areas retained as wetlands.&#13;
4.41   The main indicators of project implementation success will be (a) building&#13;
capacity within the riparian universities, the line ministries, the LVEMP secretariats and&#13;
the riparian communities for environmental analysis, conservation and adoption of&#13;
cohesive management practices on and around the lake; (b) harmonizing among the&#13;
three countries legislation addressing management of fisheries and environmental&#13;
variables important in the lake basin, and improved enforcement of this legislation; (c)&#13;
establishment of the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization (LVFO); (d) completion of&#13;
gazetting and regulating fish landing sites within the pilot zone areas and enforcing&#13;
acceptable fishing practices within a 5 km radius of fishing villages within these areas,&#13;
with full participation of lake shore fishing communities; (e) establishing sustainable&#13;
long-term capacity for management and control of water hyacinth and other invasive&#13;
weeds in the Lake Victoria Basin, through integrated weed control methods and&#13;
community involvement; (f) establishing a lake wide water quality and rainfall&#13;
monitoring system with agreed parameters to generate information on eutrophication&#13;
management and pollution control; and (g) completing a full inventory and resource&#13;
survey of Lake Victoria wetlands, and preparing investment proposals for the economic&#13;
management of these wetlands, including their rehabilitation.&#13;

5.   PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    BENEFITS&#13;
Background&#13;
5.1   The LVEMP is a comprehensive program aimed at rehabilitation of the lake&#13;
ecosystem for the benefit of the people who live in the catchment and its area of&#13;
influence. The scientific evidence shows that the present methods of exploitation and&#13;
development in the catchment are unsustainable, and that without intervention there&#13;
could be serious environmental and related socio-economic consequences. The most&#13;
pressing concern is a possible decline in the very valuable fishery (currently worth&#13;
about US$320 million annually in export revenue), but this predicted decline represents&#13;
merely an immediately obvious outcome of the loss of resilience of the ecosystem.&#13;
Sediments and pollution are degrading water quality, increasing urbanization and&#13;
agricultural expansion are both resulting in the loss of wetlands - including swamps&#13;
and satellite lakes that still shelter a remnant of a once spectacular native aquatic fauna,&#13;
changes in feeding chains and trophic systems since the introduction of exotic fish&#13;
species are trending toward a highly unstable fisheries monoculture, and - a&#13;
fundamental and ominous change - the anoxic portion of the lake waters (a biologically&#13;
almost dead zone) has been steadily increasing over recent years.&#13;
5.2   The fundamental objective of the LVEMP is to restore a healthy, varied lake&#13;
ecosystem which is inherently stable and which can support, in a sustainable way, the&#13;
many human activities in the catchment. Development pressures in the catchment are&#13;
increasing because of natural population growth and migration from poorer and less&#13;
fertile rural areas, and the multi-purpose central role of the lake is becoming&#13;
increasingly important even as its capacity to cope is being threatened.&#13;
5.3   The economy of the lake catchment produces in the order of US$3-4 billion&#13;
annually and supports an estimated population of 25 million people at standards of&#13;
living in the range of US$90-270 per capita p.a., based on national figures. The lake&#13;
catchment economy is principally an agricultural one, with a number of cash crops&#13;
(including exports of fish) and a high level of subsistence fishing and agriculture. The&#13;
quality of the physical environment is therefore a fundamental factor in maintaining&#13;
and increasing the living standards of the growing population.&#13;
Gross Benefits&#13;
5.4   The main economic benefits of the overall LVEMP derive from avoiding the&#13;
losses that can be anticipated if effective action is not taken. According to the best&#13;
understanding of the local and international scientific research community, as&#13;
documented in the material presented by the Regional Task Forces for project&#13;
preparation, the major consequences of not halting the present trends could be:&#13;
(a)   a decline in the overall fishery as a result of both overfishing and&#13;
deterioration of lake water quality;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
(b)   increasing extent and severity of water hyacinth infestation;&#13;
(c)   unsuitability of the lake water for domestic supply or animal watering;&#13;
(d)   continued degradation of the wetlands.&#13;
5.5   The regional benefits of the programme would be the incremental avoidance or&#13;
reduction of damage costs associated with these consequences, beyond the damage&#13;
avoided as a result of actions that would have been taken to achieve local benefits. In&#13;
addition there would be other benefits as a result of bringing forward projects which are&#13;
in themselves economically justified (such as soil conservation or industrial pollution&#13;
control).&#13;
(a) Fisheries&#13;
5.6   The most dramatic and direct effect of not taking action would be the onset of&#13;
instability in the Nile perch fishery. One possible scenario would be a highly variable&#13;
and unpredictable annual catch, which could drop in some years to as little as 10&#13;
percent of current levels. On the other hand, fisheries models, which still need to be&#13;
verified, suggest that a sustainable fishery could be developed which would allow&#13;
annual yields of perhaps 90 percent of current levels, still dominated by Nile perch but&#13;
with a wider range of other species.&#13;
5.7   The value of moving to the sustainable level of catch can be estimated, on a&#13;
conservative basis, as the difference between the income stream from 90 percent of the&#13;
current catch and that from an average 50 percent of the current catch, calculated after&#13;
year 5 of a management programme:&#13;
Export value of a sustainable fishery:  90% of $320m p.a. = $288m p.a.&#13;
Export value of an uncontrolled fishery:   50% of $320m p.a. = $160m p.a.&#13;
Difference, starting from year 6, attributable to the LVEMP = $128m p.a.&#13;
Present value of this revenue stream at a 12 percent discount rate: = $600m.&#13;
5.8   The major potential benefit of avoiding the projected collapse of the fisheries&#13;
would therefore be preserving export revenues with a present value of US$0.4-0.8&#13;
billion, depending on the assumptions used. The direct revenues to the fishing&#13;
communities on the lake, from these export fisheries, are estimated to have a total&#13;
present value of US$0.2-0.4 billion. These communities would receive additional&#13;
benefits from two sources: (a) that portion of the value added in processing and&#13;
packaging which is distributed to them in the form of payments for good and services,&#13;
estimated to have a present value of US$40-80 million; and (b) income from local&#13;
production and marketing of fish, estimated to have a present value of US$10-20&#13;
million. Moreover, one objective of the LVEMP is also to increase the proportion of&#13;
local food fish in the system and the benefits of the program therefore include a real&#13;
increase in the local fishery, which would be at least of the same order of magnitude as&#13;
the loss avoided. The total present value of the impact of the LVEMP on the local fish&#13;
economy would therefore be US$20-40 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
5.9    On reasonable assumptions, therefore, it is estimated that successful&#13;
implementation of the LVEMP could protect annual export earnings from the fishery to&#13;
the extent of about US$128 million per annum, which represents a present value of&#13;
exports of US$600 million, and of revenue to the lake community of US$240 480 million.&#13;
In addition, the present value of the local fishery would be increased by US$20-40&#13;
million over the case where no action is taken.&#13;
5.10   Reversing the direct loss of revenue would have major impacts through the&#13;
various industries and activities which support the fishermen active on the lake. It has&#13;
been estimated that there is a multiplier of about 5 in terms of the numbers of people&#13;
involved in these supporting activities and therefore half a million people, including&#13;
workers and their families, would be affected by reversing the loss of revenue.&#13;
Water hyacinth&#13;
5.11   The spread of the water hyacinth infestation is imposing a wide range of direct&#13;
costs on the lake community. These costs include:&#13;
- delays in commercial waterborne transport of people and goods (in some cases&#13;
reported to result in a 10-20 percent increase over scheduled times);&#13;
- increased operating costs (and possible loss of revenue) for hydropower&#13;
production at Owens Falls Dam, due to clogging of water intakes;&#13;
- loss of fishing time (and revenue) as a result of blocking of the beaches;&#13;
- increased difficulty and time spent on gathering water in villages where access&#13;
to traditional water collection areas is blocked or dangerous (because of snakes&#13;
or crocodiles in the weed);&#13;
- blockage of intakes and loss of production at urban and industrial water supply&#13;
systems.&#13;
5.12 Some initial estimates have been made for these costs but further data will be&#13;
required to refine the estimates. It should be noted that these figures represent the&#13;
present costs: the water hyacinth infestation is increasing at a rapid rate and - unless&#13;
controlled - will spread and also become more of a problem at existing sites. In the&#13;
absence of a successful control program, the following are the estimated costs within&#13;
five years:&#13;
(a)    maintaining a clear passage for ships to dock at Port Bell in Uganda:&#13;
US$3-S5 million p.a.;&#13;
(b)   cleaning intake screens at the Owen Falls hydroelectric power plant at&#13;
Jinja in Uganda: $1 nillion p.a.;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
(c)   losses in local fisheries from accumulation of water hyacinth at fishing&#13;
beaches and landing sites around the lake making it difficult or&#13;
impossible for fishing boats to be launched or recovered: US$0.2 million&#13;
p.a. but with a very serious local impact;&#13;
(d)   loss of the beaches as a water supply for domestic, stock and agricultural&#13;
purposes: US$0.35 million p.a.;&#13;
(e)   loss of supply or increased maintenance costs in urban water supply&#13;
schemes because of blockages of the water intakes by water hyacinth:&#13;
US$1.5 million p.a.;&#13;
(f)   small-scale horticultural irrigation schemes rendered useless because of&#13;
blockages of channels and pipes with hyacinth: no costs have yet been&#13;
attributed to these losses but they are important from a distributional&#13;
viewpoint since such schemes are being developed to help women in the&#13;
poorer lakeshore areas.&#13;
5.13   The total of these direct costs attributable to the water hyacinth (at its present&#13;
levels) is estimated to be US$6-10 million p.a., with a present value of US$25.40 million.&#13;
This figure can be compared with the estimated US$4.5 million cost for the Ugandan&#13;
government's emergency action program to tackle the problem, which must represent a&#13;
lower bound to estimates of the damage in what is only part of the total shoreline.&#13;
Water quality&#13;
5.14   Deteriorating water quality will have a number of direct effects, the avoidance of&#13;
which can be counted as potential benefits of the programme. These include:&#13;
- additional water treatment costs to deal with increasing levels of algae;&#13;
- impacts on water available for cattle: algal blooms can render water unsuitable&#13;
for cattle and in extreme cases are known to be fatal to animals;&#13;
- loss of potential tourist revenue: polluted or foul-smelling water would prevent&#13;
the expansion of the present (low) level of tourism to the lake;&#13;
- health effects of increased malaria and bilharzia as a result of stagnant and&#13;
polluted water.&#13;
5.15   The costs of water supply improvements can be calculated once the extent of&#13;
supply systems round the lake are detailed. As a first estimate, assuming (as before)&#13;
that one million people are affected, an additional cost of US$1 per capita would mean&#13;
US$1.5 million p.a. at present, but this would increase as the population connected&#13;
increased and a value double this would be quite reasonable, i.e. US$3 million p.a.. The&#13;
costs of water for animals is more difficult to estimate but costs of $1 per beast spread&#13;
over half a million cattle in the vicinity of the lake are plausible. A minimum cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
associated with the decline in water quality is therefore estimated at US$3.5 million&#13;
p.a.,(present value US$15 million) and increasing.&#13;
Wetlands&#13;
5.16   Given the lack of data on the type and extent of wetlands it is not possible to&#13;
estimate the value of preserving these systems, but a wide range of functions of&#13;
wetlands have been identified, both in general and for Lake Victoria in particular.&#13;
These include: buffering of the impacts of increased loads of nutrients and sediments;&#13;
breeding areas for fish and animals of value to the local population; protection of local&#13;
water supply sources; provision of papyrus and other materials of commercial value.&#13;
Preserving the wetlands is very important for sustaining biodiversity, as well as for&#13;
helping to maintain the lake as a functioning and stable ecosystem.&#13;
5.17  On the other hand, development of wetlands has been promoted because of their&#13;
potential for increased agricultural production and because of the perceived health&#13;
problems associated with wetlands (such as mosquitoes and tsetse fly). Further work is&#13;
required to understand and quantify the benefits of preserving key components of the&#13;
existing wetlands systems but the balance of professional opinion, supported by&#13;
informed local comment, is that the net value of preservation would be high.&#13;
B3iodiversity&#13;
5.18   One objective of the LVEMP is the preservation of the existing richness of the&#13;
haplochromid fish fauna because of its scientific interest and its role in providing a&#13;
resilient ecosystem for the whole lake. The ecosystem support benefits are included in&#13;
the valuation of stabilizing the fisheries, but the intrinsic and scientific value of the&#13;
biodiversity that is believed to be threatened under current conditions are additional&#13;
benefits for which no valuation is yet available.&#13;
Summary&#13;
5.19   The major direct economic benefit for which the program lays the foundation&#13;
would be avoidance of the predicted collapse in the fisheries, which is estimated to have&#13;
a present value to the lake community of US$270-520 million.&#13;
5.20   The water hyacinth problem, which is rapidly becoming more severe, is&#13;
estimated to have an annual cost of US$6-10 million under current levels of infestation.&#13;
These costs, whose present value is an estimated US$25.40 million, as well as even&#13;
larger costs which might be associated with increased infestations in the future were&#13;
nothing to be done, would be largely avoided if the LVEMP were successfully&#13;
implemented.&#13;
5.21 Deteriorating water quality may impose additional water supply costs which are&#13;
estimated to be a minimum of US$3.5 million p.a. (present value US$15 million) and&#13;
would increase considerably without action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
5.22  Other benefits arising from the preservation of wetlands and of biodiversity&#13;
have not been valued here.&#13;
Net Benefits&#13;
5.23 The costs of achieving the benefits identified here will include the direct costs of&#13;
the LVEMP, which is a regional prograrn, and of national actions which are taken in&#13;
support of the program. Many of the national expenditures, in particular, will be&#13;
economically justified in their own right (for example, fisheries post-harvest&#13;
improvements or provision of sewerage) and so the effect of the LVEMP will be to bring&#13;
forward in time the net benefits of these programmes. In such cases, the costs and&#13;
benefits attributable to the LVEMP will be the marginal ones related to the changes in&#13;
timing or focus of the national programmes.&#13;
5.24  Typical of the projects to be tackled as national concerns, within the framework&#13;
of the LVEMP, which would be expected to produce net benefits in their own right, and&#13;
where the costs attributable to the LVEMP may be exceeded by the benefits achieved&#13;
through bringing the projects forward would be:&#13;
*  expansion of artisanal fishing and processing;&#13;
*  reduction in post-harvest fish losses;&#13;
*  implementation of water hyacinth control;&#13;
*  wetland conservation;&#13;
*  improved pasture management;&#13;
*  catchment soil conservation;&#13;
*  rural water and sanitation;&#13;
*  urban sewerage upgrading;&#13;
*  industrial pollution abatement.&#13;
In so far as these projects can be implemented under existing or proposed programmes&#13;
and as long as they are economic in their own right, the net costs to the LVEMP will be&#13;
minimal.&#13;
B.   ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
5.25  The program is in effect a regional environmental action plan for Lake Victoria,&#13;
having as its central objective improving the environmental conditions of Lake Victoria&#13;
and its catchment. However, the program will encompass a wide range of different&#13;
interventions and investments, and has been designated as Category B for&#13;
environmental analysis to ensure that adequate attention will be given to the many&#13;
overall positive impacts as well as to individual components which might have adverse&#13;
local environmental effects.&#13;
Positive Impacts&#13;
5.26  The environmental analysis (available separately) outlines the problems the&#13;
program is trying to address, and the potential benefits from proposed measures to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
implemented. Beginning with a discussion of population growth, which underlies the&#13;
pressures to which the lake and its catchment are increasingly being subjected, the&#13;
analysis proceeds to assess the pressures. Populations of urban areas around the lake&#13;
are growing at an estimated 6 percent p.a. or more, and rural areas near the lake shore&#13;
are experiencing in-migration which is causing faster growth of their populations even&#13;
than the already high national averages of over 3 percent p.a.&#13;
5.27  This population pressure is, in particular, contributing to the existence of&#13;
pollution "hot spots" where there is especially heavy localized degradation of water&#13;
quality in the lake, from human waste, urban runoff, and the effluent discharges of such&#13;
industries as breweries, tanning, paper processing, fish processing, sugar factories,&#13;
coffee washing stations, and abattoirs. In addition there is some inflow of residues from&#13;
the use of chemical herbicides and pesticides in selected agricultural operations in the&#13;
lake catchment, and specialized industries such as gold mining are responsible for the&#13;
presence of localized areas of heavy metals. The project would locate and quantify&#13;
these problems, identify the sources of pollution, propose and begin to implement&#13;
ameliorative measures, and strengthen existing institutions to sustain solutions in the&#13;
longer term.&#13;
5.28   The population pressure is also contributing to the inflow of nutrients into the&#13;
lake, which are responsible for algal buildup, oxygen depletion, and to the burgeoning&#13;
water hyacinth infestation. Since the levels of fertilizer use in agricultural areas around&#13;
the catchment are in general low, the main rural source of these nutrients is soil erosion,&#13;
which releases nitrogen and phosphorus held in the natural soil profile. In many&#13;
instances such nutrients are not available to agriculture, but are released by chemical&#13;
changes once the soil is washed into the lake. From urban areas and lake shore&#13;
communities, the main sources of nutrients are human waste, especially from untreated&#13;
sewage. Although sewage schemes in the lake catchment are frequently inoperative or&#13;
in bad repair, in some cases the nutrients are filtered out by wetlands prior to reaching&#13;
the lake. Where there is no such buffering capacity, or the capacity is overloaded, there&#13;
is a positive buildup of nutrients ir. the lake. The project will locate and quantify these&#13;
problems, identify the sources of nutrients, propose and begin to implement&#13;
ameliorative measures, including some innovative pilot initiatives, and strengthen&#13;
existing institutions to sustain solutions in the longer term.&#13;
5.29  The area in which the project would make the most economic difference would&#13;
be in heading off developing instability and possible serious collapse of the valuable&#13;
lake fisheries.&#13;
Negative Impacts And How They Would Be Addressed&#13;
5.30   The main areas where activities undertaken in the project may have negative&#13;
environmental impacts are the following:&#13;
(a)   measures to try to restore and stabilize the fish ecology in the lake might&#13;
have unforeseen effects, because the huge, complex ecosystem is not&#13;
understood completely, although knowledge of the ecosystem is better&#13;
now than it was when exotic fish were introduced previously;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
(b)    attempts to develop innovative aquaculture might have unforeseen&#13;
effects on the ecosystem, as did the introduction of exotic species in the&#13;
past;&#13;
(c)    biological agents used as the main line of long term control of water&#13;
hyacinth might have unforeseen effects on other parts of the ecosystem&#13;
and the catchment;&#13;
(d)    herbicides used to control water hyacinth might damage other crops, add&#13;
to water pollution, kill fish, and themselves contribute to anoxia in the&#13;
lake, especially in littoral areas;&#13;
(e)    attempts to reduce the inflow of pollutants into the lake might result in&#13;
their having negative effects in other environments.&#13;
5.31   The following steps will be taken during project implementation, to minimise&#13;
the possibilities of these negative impacts arising, or mitigate their effects:&#13;
(a)   fish ecology - the most important precaution is that any proposed&#13;
interventions (such as changes in net sizes or other controls over the&#13;
fishing effort) should be clearly defined and carefully assessed before&#13;
introduction. The assessment should include specific consideration of&#13;
possible unpredictable responses, and should allow for relevant peer&#13;
review or independent comment. The interventions must be&#13;
accompanied by projections of measurable responses in the system and&#13;
methods for measuring and reporting on the relevant parameters.&#13;
(b)    aquaculture - the scale of any proposed aquaculture needs to be limited&#13;
until the requirements and impacts of the system are well established.&#13;
The onus will be on the promoters of any introduced species to&#13;
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the scientific community that this will&#13;
not have any adverse or unexpected effects. Therefore before any&#13;
releases take place, there will be a full environmental assessment. Where&#13;
systems are developed to support or reintroduce native species, the&#13;
schemes should be developed at a pilot scale so that the consequences of&#13;
large scale projects can be predicted and evaluated.&#13;
(c)    biological control agents - all biological control agents under consideration&#13;
have been subjected to exhaustive field testing over twenty years in&#13;
several countries. For all three control agents, the conclusion was: "there&#13;
is no doubt that [the agent] is restricted to water hyacinth and that it may&#13;
be introduced into regions infested with this weed without risk of&#13;
damage to other plant species."4 The two species of weevils have been&#13;
tested extensively in Kenya and Uganda, and released in both countries&#13;
in lakes other than Lake Victoria. The testing protocols have been&#13;
Harley, K.L.S., The Role of Biological Control in the Management of Water Hyacinth, Eichornia&#13;
crassipes, Biocontrol News and Information, Vol 11, No. 1, 1990,11-22.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
satisfactory, and no results different from those observed elsewhere have&#13;
been noted. Any additional biological control agents available during&#13;
project implementation will be subjected to similar testing protocols.&#13;
(d)   herbicides - herbicides used in the water hyacinth control program will be&#13;
acceptable to IDA, they will be used sparingly, in strictly selected and&#13;
confined areas, all persons applying such herbicides will be trained in&#13;
their safe and appropriate handling and use, and mechanisms for careful&#13;
monitoring of herbicide use will be established.&#13;
(e)   pollutants - pollution control projects must be properly designed with the&#13;
necessary attention to treatment and disposal systems and to long-term&#13;
financing mechanisms which will allow for the necessary maintenance&#13;
and upgrading. A project specific environmental assessment will be&#13;
required for these components, and for any larger investments following,&#13;
to guard against the possibility that any uncontrolled dumping of&#13;
domestic and industrial wastes would take place.&#13;
C.    RISKS&#13;
5.32  The main risk is that the strength of the commitments by the three Governments&#13;
will fail to sustain a regional environmental management program for the lake basin.&#13;
This may express itself through inadequate budgetary arrangements to fund regional&#13;
bodies (such as the LVFO) or coordinating agencies, erosion over time of the powers&#13;
given to such institutions, or unwillingness or lack of capacity to follow-up on regional&#13;
regulatory decisions or guidelines through enforcement at the national level. Since the&#13;
three governments have collaborated well during program preparation, and the&#13;
proposed program provides many opportunities for low-risk collaboration on technical&#13;
issues, which should build confidence steadily during implementation, any waning&#13;
commitment would seem likely to arise only from sources external to the program. The&#13;
risk of inadequate or unforeseen results emerging from the research and studies in the&#13;
program would be reduced by the appointment of an international Panel of Scientists&#13;
who would review regularly scientific issues arising in the course of project&#13;
implementation. In the event of fiscal crises, the project is structured so as to allow&#13;
postponement of work in the pilot zones planned for the outer years of the project. In&#13;
this way the essential core of lake-wide activities would be preserved, as well as the&#13;
coordinated nature of the adaptive environmental management approach in at least a&#13;
sub-set of the 14 pilot areas. Upon resolution of any funding crisis, work could be&#13;
resumed with minimum disruption to progress.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
6.   AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1   On August 5,1994, the Governments of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda signed a&#13;
Tripartite Agreement jointly to prepare and implement a Lake Victoria Environmental&#13;
Management Program (LVEMP). That important agreement provided for&#13;
organizational arrangements for project preparation, some of which will be continued&#13;
into project implementation. In particular, the Agreement provided for a Regional&#13;
Policy and Steering Committee, which has functioned during project preparation with a&#13;
membership of nine at the level of Permanent Secretary, three from each country, drawn&#13;
from the main Ministries dealing with environment, water, fisheries, and agriculture.&#13;
The existence of this Agreement reduced, but did not eliminate the need for further&#13;
assurances, which complemented and supplemented those already obtained under the&#13;
Tripartite Agreement.&#13;

LAKE VICTORIA ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
A.   Introduction&#13;
1.    This summarizes the Project Implementation Plan (PIP), which is a joint product&#13;
of the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Secretariats (LVEMPS) of&#13;
Kenya,Tanzania and Uganda and IDA/GEF officials responsible for the Lake Victoria&#13;
Environmental Management Project (LVEMP).&#13;
B.   Overall Responsibility&#13;
2.    LVEMPS: Overall responsibility for coordinating project implementation will&#13;
rest with the LVEMP Secretariats (LVEMPS), created under the Tripartite Agreement&#13;
signed by the Governments of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda on August 5,1994. Under&#13;
the Agreement the three governments undertook to establish a Regional Policy Steering&#13;
Committee ( RPSC) to be assisted by a Regional Secretariat and two National&#13;
Secretariats. The Regional Secretariat is located in Tanzania. Under the project the&#13;
LVEMPS's will: a) provide a secretariat to the LVEMP; b) ensure efficient&#13;
implementation of the LVEMP by establishing a monitoring and coordinating&#13;
mechanism; c) assist in building institutional and human resource capacity within the&#13;
program; d) organize donor coordination; e) assist in formulating harmonised policies,&#13;
institutions and a legal framework relevant to Lake Victoria; f) establish necessary&#13;
linkages between the LVEMP and the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organisation (LVFO); g)&#13;
provide logistical support to the sectoral ministries and agencies for implementation of&#13;
the program; h) ensure compliance with IDA and GEF reporting, procurement and&#13;
disbursement procedure; and i) provide policy guidance and a forum for conflict&#13;
resolution. In addition the Regional Secretariat through the RPSC will monitor and&#13;
review progress of implementation, report on progress every quarter, and provide&#13;
guidance and direction to the LVEMP.&#13;
3.    The Regional Secretariat in Tanzania will assist the RPSC, and provide linkages&#13;
with other regional agencies dealing with issues pertaining to Lake Victoria. This&#13;
Secretariat, working under the office of the Vice President in the Department of&#13;
Environment, Poverty Alleviation and Union Matters, will report to the RPSC. The&#13;
Regional Secretariat will also perform the function of the National Secretariat for&#13;
LVEMP implementation in Tanzania.&#13;
4.   In Kenya the LVEMP Secretariat will work under the Ministry of Environment&#13;
and Natural Resources, while in Uganda it will be under the Ministry of Natural&#13;
Resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;

5.    The Regional Policy and Steering Committee, headed by a chairperson who will&#13;
be elected by that committee from among its membership at its first meeting and&#13;
thereafter on an annual rotation, will include a maximum of three representatives of&#13;
each country led by an officer at Permanent Secretary level. The Executive Secretary, to&#13;
be appointed by the RPSC, at its first meeting, will as head of the Regional Secretariat be&#13;
responsible for monitoring progress, preparing review meetings, and compiling reports&#13;
as required by IDA and GEF. The National Secretariat in each country will assist the&#13;
Executive Secretary of the Regional Secretariat in preparing regional meetings and&#13;
regional level reports. The locations of National Secretariats in each country will be&#13;
determined by the respective Governments.&#13;
6.    The Regional Secretariat in Tanzania and the National Secretariats in Kenya and&#13;
Uganda will each be headed by a full-time professional (equivalent in qualifications and&#13;
experience to a Deputy Principal/Permanent Secretary) who will be accountable to the&#13;
Principal/Permanent Secretary of their parent Ministry and will have full responsibility&#13;
for coordinating LVEMP activities. Each LVEMP Secretariat will be staffed with: (a) one&#13;
Project Accountant; (b) one Procurement/Disbursement Officer (PDO); (c) one&#13;
Operations Officer (OPO); (d) one Management Information Systems Officer (MISO);&#13;
one secretary, two drivers and one messenger. The major responsibility of the PDO will&#13;
be to ensure that all Ministries, agencies, and institutions using Project funds set up&#13;
proper accounting systems and maintain proper accounts, and promptly claim&#13;
reimbursement from C,EF and IDA. All withdrawal applications will be submitted to&#13;
IDA/ GEF through the office of the PDO so that a proper track of expenditures on&#13;
different components of the Program in other institutions and ministries or departments&#13;
is kept, and IDA/ GEF disbursements are received by the beneficiaries without undue&#13;
delay. The PDO will also be responsible for supervising the Project's "Special Account"&#13;
and guiding various implementing agencies with regard to procedures for its use. The&#13;
major responsibility of the OPO will be to supervise closely the implementation of&#13;
various Project components, identify implementation bottlenecks in the field and/or at&#13;
Headquarters, and bring these bottlenecks to the attention of the head of the Regional/&#13;
National Secretariat. The OPO will also coordinate training and provide the MISO with&#13;
reports on physical and financial progress. The latter will establish and operate an&#13;
approved management information system installed by consultants, obtain periodical&#13;
reports from various managers concerned with project implementation, collate data and&#13;
reports and submit them to the head of the LVEMP Secretariat. The MISO will collect&#13;
data on key monitorable indicators and prepare quarterly and annual reports to be&#13;
submitted to IDA/GEF in agreed formats, as well as background and progress reports&#13;
for IDA/GEF review missions.&#13;
7.    LVEMP secretariat staff will be recruited on personnel service contracts. Their&#13;
salaries and wages for the duration of the project will be financed by the GEF, together&#13;
with expenditures on vehicles and equipment required for LVEMP to ensure rapid&#13;
build up of its implementation capacity.&#13;
C.    Specific Responsibilities of the Secretariats for LVEMP&#13;
8.    The LVEMP Regional Secretariat's specific responsibilities will include, but not&#13;
be limited to: (a) organisation of semi annual meetings of RPSC members for obtaining&#13;

that they will provide adequate and timely budgetary and staffing support to the&#13;
implementing ministries, institutions and agencies to undertake these responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;

10.   The LVEMP secretariats will set up the following institutional and regulatory&#13;
mechanisms to secure inter-agency coordination, obtain periodic feedback, submit&#13;
regular progress reports to IDA/ GEF in agreed formats, and thereby implement the&#13;
Lake Victoria Environmental Management Program:&#13;
(a)   Project Implementation Committee (PIC): In each country the LVEMPS will set&#13;
up a Project Implementation Committee (PIC) with membership drawn from all&#13;
implementing agencies. The OPO of the LVEMP National Secretariat will be nominated&#13;
as Secretary of the PIC. Members will include representatives from the&#13;
Ministries/Departments of Environment and Natural Resources, Fisheries, Water, and&#13;
Agriculture, along with members of specialised technical agencies/institutions&#13;
participating in the program, private sector and non governmental organisations. The&#13;
PIC will meet every month under the Chairmanship of the Head of the LVEMP&#13;
National Secretariat . The agenda of PIC meetings will include review of the physical&#13;
and financial progress of the various project components including programs in littoral&#13;
pilot zones, in wetlands as well as in rivers within the Lake Victoria Catchment,&#13;
community participation, publication and dissemination of information, progress in&#13;
procurement, construction of works and installation of equipment. To this end, the&#13;
LVEMPS will define for each of the implementing agencies the formats and the timing&#13;
for submission of the quarterly progress reports.&#13;
(b)   Meetings with Regional Sub-Program Resource Personnel: In order to&#13;
maintain close grass root contacts and stay current with the problems of each region/&#13;
subcomponent, and to assist the newly set-up pilot zone administrations, LVEMPS will&#13;
convene meetings each quarter at selected places in the country, each in a cluster of&#13;
mostly contiguous regions. These meetings will be used to review, on a regional basis,&#13;
the problems encountered and progress made in the implementation of various&#13;
components of LVEMP, and to agree on the next steps and a work plan for the pilot&#13;
projects under implementation, including programs implemented lake wide. Project-&#13;
specific protocols for start up will be drawn up after rapid appraisal and establishment&#13;
of bench mark status. Representatives of the concerned research institutions,&#13;
government extension departments, stakeholders and community based organisations,&#13;
and the faculty of national universities will participate in these meetings.&#13;
(c)   Community Involvement in the Program: Comnmunity participation is&#13;
considered key to the successful implementation of the program. This will imply&#13;
involvement and participation of stakeholders including empowerment of communities&#13;
for eventual ownership of the programs targeted for their benefit. In keeping with this&#13;
overall objective the LVEMPS will ensure that the processes of education,&#13;
communication, awareness creation, community participation and motivation are&#13;
followed consistently and thoroughly throughout the implementation phase of the&#13;
program, and that seminars, workshops and demonstrations are conducted in a timely&#13;
and organised manner. A systematic community education program will need to be&#13;
launched, to teach rural communities not only in formal class settings but through radio&#13;
or video programs the benefits of environmental conservation and management. The&#13;
LVEMPS will oversee these efforts by assisting in the preparation of workshops and&#13;
seminars, reviewing comprehensively the achievements of each of these events,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 5 of 13&#13;
identifying success and failure, and preparing in consultation with and cooperation of&#13;
all participating agencies, workplans for implementation during the following year and&#13;
assigning responsibilities for future specific actions. LVEMPS in their regular meetings&#13;
will review the progress in the implementation of recommended activities, and include&#13;
the results of such review in quarterly progress reports to their respective Ministry, IDA&#13;
and GEF.&#13;
(d)   Workshops on Procurement, Disbursements and Project Management: The&#13;
LVEMPS will organize, with IDA/GEF assistance, a workshop on procurement,&#13;
disbursement and project management in Project Year 1 (and in subsequent years if&#13;
necessary) for selected staff engaged in LVEMP implementation procurement,&#13;
disbursement and project management. The concerned staff will also receive intensive&#13;
training in IDA/GEF procedures.&#13;
(e)   Mid-Term Review (MTR): The LVEMPS will collaborate with IDA in a Mid-&#13;
Term Review (MTR) of LVEMP, which will be held by the end of March, 1999. The&#13;
LVEMPS will enlist the participation of all implementing agencies. The MTR will&#13;
include a review of progress in policy reform, including harmonised legislation, legal&#13;
framework and institutional arrangements for regional cooperation. It will also review&#13;
progress achieved in staffing, funding and operational activities, and capacity building.&#13;
As part of the Mid-Term Review, the three governments will prepare an updated&#13;
analysis of transboundary environmental concerns, to guide the second phase of project&#13;
implementation, and set the stage for subsequent initiatives. Based on the findings of&#13;
the Mid- Term Review, the Project will be restructured, if and when necessary.&#13;
(f)   Project Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation: The LVEMPS will be&#13;
responsible for coordinating the development of annual work plans for various Project&#13;
components and maintaining data on implementation progress. To this end the&#13;
LVEMPS will:&#13;
(i) establish bench marks for evaluation of subsequent project&#13;
achievements in consultation with implementing agencies;&#13;
(ii) prepare quarterly progress reports, providing a descriptive and&#13;
analytical account of project achievements and highlighting implementation&#13;
problems; these reports will be submitted regularly to the respective Ministries&#13;
of Environment and Natural Resources and IDA for the quarters ending March,&#13;
June, September and December of each year. The comments and directives of&#13;
the Ministries, if any, on the quarterly reports will also be communicated to IDA;&#13;
(iii) prepare and submit to IDA an Implementation Completion Report&#13;
(ICR) within six months from project closing date. IDA will provide the&#13;
LVEMPS with a standard format for the ICR. The ICR will, inter alia, include the&#13;
Government's assessment of the extent to which objectives were realized, details&#13;
of physical and financial achievements, problems encountered, solutions found&#13;
and lessons learned. The ICR will include a revised GEF Strategic Action&#13;
Program, containing an outline of interventions needed to address priority&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 6 of 13&#13;
problems. IDA will use this as the basis for convening a donors' meeting to seek&#13;
commitments to support such interventions.&#13;
(g)   Audit: The LVEMPS will ensure that separate books of account are maintained&#13;
in LVEMPS and by each implementing agency for all project-related accounts. These&#13;
accounts, together with special accounts and statements of expenditure, will be audited&#13;
on an annual basis, by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA, and audit reports wiU&#13;
be submitted to IDA within six months from the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
(h)   Quality Control: LVEMPS will organize periodical evaluations and technical&#13;
reviews of the program's implementation. The LVEMPS wiU also coordinate&#13;
arrangements for the Panel of Scientists, whose 7 members will serve as an overall&#13;
advisory group for the scientific studies of the lake. They wiU meet once a year to&#13;
review issues arising from project implementation, and will meet at other times as&#13;
required, as wel as being available individuaUly, at the request of the Regional Policy&#13;
and Steering Committee, to provide advice about specific issues. The LVEMPS wiU&#13;
ensure that the advice and comments tendered by the Panel are addressed by the&#13;
implementing agencies.&#13;
11.   The performance of the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organisation (LVFO), which wiU&#13;
have a critical role in ensuring the quality of implementation of several important&#13;
components of the program, wiU also be reviewed by IDA/GEF supervision missions.&#13;
The LVFO will furnish quarterly progress reports to the Ministries of Environment and&#13;
Natural Resources, in a format to be agreed during Project implementation; these&#13;
reports will, on request, be available to IDA. At the Mid-Term Review, the performance&#13;
and future needs/ sustainability of the LVFO will also be reviewed.&#13;
D.   Focal Points For Implementation of LVEMP&#13;
12.   Focal points for implementation of LVEMP wiU be as follows: (a) at the&#13;
Regional level, the RPSC with the assistance of the Regional Secretariat wiU be&#13;
responsible for the overall direction, planning, monitoring and assessment of the&#13;
program; (b) at the National level, the LVEMP National Secretariats, assisted by the&#13;
sectoral ministries/departments, identified universities and/or research institutions will&#13;
be responsible for the overall direction, planning, monitoring and assessment of the&#13;
respective national program; (c) at the Zonal level the office of the Regional&#13;
Commissioner, the Zonal Officer with the assistance of selected Extension Staff; and&#13;
Local Agencies; (d) at the Community /Village Level, Non Governmental&#13;
Organizations and Community Based Organizations, selected community leaders,&#13;
groups of fisherfolk, farmers and Extension Agents.&#13;
13.   Major components of the program will be implemented by various national&#13;
agencies as follows: (a) the three Fisheries Research Institutes (KEMFRI, TAFIRI and&#13;
FIRI) will play lead roles in all sub-components of fisheries research, and will&#13;
collaborate with the Fisheries Departments of their respective governments in the&#13;
fisheries extension, and with the Ministries of Water in the Water Quality components;&#13;
(b) the Ministries of Water will be the lead agencies for the Water Quality components,&#13;
and they will in turn collaborate dosely with the Ministries of Environment, Natural&#13;

E.    Capacity Building&#13;
14.   The LVEMPS will coordinate the capacity building programs under the program&#13;
and take the overall responsibility for Training. Each implementing department and&#13;
agency will prepare an annual training plan and submit it to the respective LVEMP&#13;
National Secretariat. The training plan will identify the subjects and courses for&#13;
training, their timing, duration, estimated costs, name and location of the training&#13;
institutions, the names of the persons proposed, and the justification for their training.&#13;
The training plans will be submitted to IDA for approval, the first within three months&#13;
of Credit Effectiveness, and subsequent annual plans by May 15 of each year.&#13;
15.   Every sub-program makes extensive provision for capacity building. The&#13;
training program will include regional fellowships (including about 100 Masters&#13;
Degrees and 15 PhDs), study tours, on-site training to the national regional and field&#13;
staff, selected community leaders, fisherfolk/farmers and entrepreneurs. At least 2,000&#13;
short-term and on-job training opportunities are provided in the project, and at least 600&#13;
stakeholder workshops.&#13;

EASTERN AFRICA&#13;
LAKE VICTORIA ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT PERFORMANCE AND IMPACT INDICATORS&#13;
The project is designed to be a mixture of information-gathering, capacity-&#13;
building, institution establishment, and actions to begin to deal with the environmental&#13;
problems of the lake and its catchment, with an emphasis on fisheries management,&#13;
water hyacinth control, improving water quality, and land use management (including&#13;
wetlands). A central concern is to reduce the flow of nutrients and pollutants into the&#13;
lake, and reverse some of the adverse environmental developments of the past. This&#13;
project will attempt to lay the foundations in these areas, and provide a "central core"&#13;
around which will coalesce a larger program of investments to clean up the lake, and&#13;
establish sustainable development of the lake and its catchment in the face of the&#13;
growing population pressures likely to be experienced.&#13;
Project Implementation: success will be measured by (a) building capacity&#13;
within the riparian universities, the line ministries, the LVEMP secretariats and the&#13;
riparian communities for environmental analysis, conservation and adoption of&#13;
cohesive management practices on the lake; (b) harmonizing among the three countries&#13;
legislation addressing management of fisheries and environmental variables important&#13;
in the lake basin, and improved enforcement of this legislation; (c) establishment of the&#13;
Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization (LVFO); (d) completion of gazetting and regulating&#13;
fish landing sites within the pilot zone areas and enforcing acceptable fishing practices&#13;
within a 5 km radius of fishing villages within these areas, with full participation of lake&#13;
shore fishing communities; (e) establishing sustainable long-term capacity for&#13;
management and control of water hyacinth and other invasive weeds in the Lake&#13;
Victoria Basin, through integrated weed control methods and community involvement;&#13;
(f) establishing a lake wide water quality and rainfall monitoring system with agreed&#13;
parameters to generate information on eutrophication management and pollution&#13;
control; and (g) completing a full inventory and resource survey of Lake Victoria&#13;
wetlands, and preparing investment proposals for the economic management of these&#13;
wetlands, including their rehabilitation.&#13;
Project Impact: success will be measured by: (a) reductions in the nutrient and&#13;
fecal coliform counts from towns bordering the lake; (b) reductions in sediment and&#13;
phosphorus loading in rivers flowing into the lake; (c) reductions by at least 50 percent&#13;
over five years in significant industrial pollutants entering the lake; (d) stabilizing the&#13;
Nile perch catch at least at current levels, and increasing the recovery of other species;&#13;
(e) measurable reduction in the infestation of water hyacinth; and (f) stabilization of&#13;
areas retained as wetlands.&#13;

EASTERN AFRICA&#13;
LAKE VICTORIA ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
GEF INCREMENTAL COSTS&#13;
Lake Victoria is a "commons" of water, biota, nutrients, pollutants, and the human&#13;
activities which use the resources of the lake and its catchments, and impact upon them. In&#13;
matters such as fishing, the addition of nutrients to the lake, pollution of the lake and its&#13;
tributaries, the economic characteristics of behavior in a "commons" apply - in particular, the&#13;
incentives perceived by the individuals, and individual countries involved, all are conducive to&#13;
actions which may be in the best, short-term interests of the individuals concerned, but not in the&#13;
best interests of the whole group of countries, nor the global community.&#13;
The project will be the first regional program to address the major environmental threats&#13;
to the Lake Victoria ecosystem, all of which are transboundary in character. The project will&#13;
develop the information, capacity and institutions needed for collective action, and test, through a&#13;
number of targetted pilot actions and investments, the feasibility and initial impact of some of the&#13;
priority regional initiatives needed to stabilize the lake ecosystem. Each project component&#13;
involves significant transaction and regional capacity-building costs first to establish cooperative&#13;
agreements, and second to implement priority elements of them on a trial basis. These costs are&#13;
clearly incremental in that they are not in the national baselines, would not be incurred without&#13;
the project, and address transboundary environmental issues.&#13;
The project will lay the foundations - of knowledge, capacity, and cooperative&#13;
institutional frameworks - for a long-term program of investments in the lake and its catchments,&#13;
which will rehabilitate and stabilise the ecosystem. In particular, these will be investments in&#13;
cleaning up the waste discharges from polluting industries, rehabilitating and expanding water&#13;
supply and sanitation systems, reduction of soil erosion, and sustainable management of fisheries&#13;
and wetlands. There will be substantial investments in these even within the five years of&#13;
LVEMP implementation, guided by the conceptualization which has already taken place, and the&#13;
findings of the LVEMP during implementation. Success in the current project will lay the&#13;
foundations for longer term national benefits for the three countries concemed. For example, if&#13;
the long-standing barriers to regional fisheries cooperation can be overcome, the design and&#13;
implementation of a regional fisheries management program will eventually contribute to a more&#13;
sustainable fish catch, as well as conservation of the lake's aquatic biodiversity. Installation of&#13;
improved sanitation and water treatment facilities will have benefits for the health of local and&#13;
national populations.&#13;
There are, however, significant transaction costs which act as barriers to achieving these&#13;
benefits, as demonstrated by the lack of progress to date. Examples of the barriers are the lack of&#13;
institutional capacity, information and scientific understanding. The costs of overcoming these&#13;
barriers are therefore truly incremental. So too are the costs of actions to achieve additional&#13;
global benefits, such as aquaculture in support of endangered species, and conservation of critical&#13;
habitats. Incremental costs of the project are estimated to be US$38.8 million (details in following&#13;
table). In addition to financing the baseline and adjusted baseline measures from non-GEF (IDA)&#13;
sources, the three riparian governments have agreed to contribute US$3.8 million from their own&#13;
resources to finance a part of the project's incremental cost. They have requested a GEF grant of&#13;
US$35 million to fund the balance.&#13;

            Environmental Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Lake Victoria
            Environmental Management Project are to: a) maximize the
            sustainable benefits to riparian communities from using
            resources within the basin to generate food, employment and
            income, supply safe water, and sustain a disease-free
            environment; and b) conserve biodiversity and genetic
            resources for the benefit of the riparian communities and
            the global community. A further project objective is to
            harmonize national management programs in order to achieve,
            to the maximum extent possible, the reversal of increasing
            environmental degradation. This project has eight
            components. They include: 1) fisheries management; 2)
            fisheries research; 3) fisheries extension, policies, and
            laws; 4) water hyacinth control; 5) water quality
            monitoring; 6) industrial and municipal waste management; 7)
            land use and wetland management; and 8) policy and
            institutional framework.
