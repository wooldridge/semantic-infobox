&amp;#12;      Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      This World Development Report is about creating opportunities for people to escape from&#13;
      poverty and improve their living standards. It is about creating a climate in which ï¬?rms and&#13;
      entrepreneurs of all typesâ&#128;&#148;from farmers and microenterprises to local manufacturing con-&#13;
      cerns and multinationalsâ&#128;&#148;have opportunities and incentives to invest productively, create&#13;
      jobs, and expand, and thereby contribute to growth and poverty reduction. The Report thus&#13;
      deals with one of the central challenges of development.&#13;
         Expanding opportunities for people in developing countries is a pressing concern for gov-&#13;
      ernments and for the global community. Nearly half the worldâ&#128;&#153;s population lives on less than $2&#13;
      a day, and 1.1 billion barely survive on less than $1 a day. Young people have more than double&#13;
      the average unemployment rate in all regions, and population growth will add nearly 2 billion&#13;
      more people to developing countries over the next 30 years. Improving the climate for invest-&#13;
      ment in developing countries is essential to provide jobs and opportunities for young people&#13;
      and to build a more inclusive, balanced, and peaceful world.&#13;
         There is good news. More governments are recognizing that their policies and behaviors&#13;
      play a critical role in shaping the investment climates of their societies, and they are making&#13;
      changes. China and India provide compelling examples: investment climate improvements in&#13;
      these countries have driven growth and the most dramatic reductions in poverty in history.&#13;
      Many other governments are also taking on the agenda, but progress remains slow and uneven.&#13;
      Governments still saddle ï¬?rms and entrepreneurs with unnecessary costs, create substantial&#13;
      uncertainty and risk, and erect unjustiï¬?ed barriers to competition.&#13;
         This yearâ&#128;&#153;s World Development Report, the 27th in the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s ï¬&#130;agship series, looks at&#13;
      what governments can do to create better investment climates for their societies. Drawing on&#13;
      new research, including surveys of nearly 30,000 ï¬?rms in 53 developing countries, other new&#13;
      data, and country case studies, it makes four main points.&#13;
         First, the Report emphasizes that the goal should be to create an investment climate that is&#13;
      better for everyoneâ&#128;&#148;in two dimensions. The investment climate should beneï¬?t society as a&#13;
      whole, not only ï¬?rms. Well-designed regulation and taxation are thus an important part of a&#13;
      good investment climate. And the investment climate should embrace ï¬?rms of all types, not&#13;
      just large or inï¬&#130;uential ï¬?rms. Small and large ï¬?rms, local and foreign ï¬?rms, and low-tech and&#13;
      high-tech ï¬?rms each have important and complementary contributions to make to growth and&#13;
      poverty reduction.&#13;
         Second, the Report argues that efforts to improve the investment climate need to go beyond&#13;
      just reducing business costs. Those costs can indeed be extraordinary in many countries,&#13;
      amounting to several times what ï¬?rms pay in taxes. But policy-related risks dominate ï¬?rmsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
      concerns in developing countries and can cripple incentives to invest. And barriers to competi-&#13;
      tion remain pervasive, dulling incentives for ï¬?rms to innovate and increase productivity. Gov-&#13;
      ernments need to address all three aspects of a good investment climate.&#13;
         Third, the Report underscores that progress requires more than changes in formal policies.&#13;
      The gaps between policies and their implementation can be huge, with the vast informal&#13;
      economies in many developing countries providing the most palpable evidence. Governments&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 xiii&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                 need to bridge these gaps and address deeper sources of policy failure that can undermine a sound&#13;
                 investment climate. Governments need to tackle corruption and other forms of rent-seeking, to&#13;
                 build credibility with ï¬?rms, to foster public trust and legitimacy, and to ensure their policy interven-&#13;
                 tions are crafted to ï¬?t local conditions.&#13;
                     Finally, the Report reviews strategies for tackling such a broad agenda. It emphasizes that perfec-&#13;
                 tion is not required and that everything does not have to be done at once. But progress requires gov-&#13;
                 ernments to address important constraints in ways that give ï¬?rms the conï¬?dence to investâ&#128;&#148;and to&#13;
                 sustain a process of ongoing improvements. Persistence pays off.&#13;
                     These ï¬?ndings are supported by detailed analysis and the many examples discussed throughout&#13;
                 the Report, which should provide practical insights for policymakers and for others concerned with&#13;
                 growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.&#13;
                     Improving the investment climate is the ï¬?rst pillar of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s overall development strat-&#13;
                 egy. The World Development Report 2005 complements last yearâ&#128;&#153;s WDR, which addressed key aspects&#13;
                 of the second pillar of that strategy: investing in and empowering people to take advantage of oppor-&#13;
                 tunities. Together, these two Reports offer sound advice and research that will help the World Bank&#13;
                 and our partners realize our common dreamâ&#128;&#148;a world free of poverty.&#13;

While averages are reported, there are signiï¬?cant variations across ï¬?rms. The data are not intended for the ranking of countries.&#13;
The WDR Survey of Micro and Informal Firms was also conducted in 11 countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda.&#13;
The ï¬?ndings of these surveys are not reï¬&#130;ected in this table. For more information, see Hallward-Driemeier and Stone (2004).&#13;

A Better Investment Climate&#13;
for Everyone&#13;
Firms and entrepreneurs of all typesâ&#128;&#148;from microenterprises to multinationalsâ&#128;&#148;play a&#13;
central role in growth and poverty reduction. Their investment decisions drive job creation,&#13;
the availability and affordability of goods and services for consumers, and the tax revenues&#13;
governments can draw on to fund health, education, and other services. The contribution&#13;
they make to society depends largely on the way governments shape the investment climate&#13;
in each locationâ&#128;&#148;through the protection of property rights, regulation and taxation,&#13;
strategies for providing infrastructure, and interventions in finance and labor markets. New&#13;
sources of data from the World Bank highlight how investment climates vary dramatically&#13;
across, as well as within, countries and underline the potential for improvement.&#13;
The World Development Report 2005: A Better Investment Climate for Everyone argues that&#13;
improving the investment climates of their societies should be a top priority for govern-&#13;
ments. Drawing on surveys of nearly 30,000 firms in 53 developing countries, country case&#13;
studies, and other new research, the Report explores questions such as:&#13;
â&#128;¢ What are the key features of a good investment climate, and how do they influence&#13;
    growth and poverty?&#13;
â&#128;¢   Why is progress in improving the investment climate often slow and difficult?&#13;
â&#128;¢   What practical lessons can be drawn from country experiences on how to tackle such a&#13;
    broad agenda?&#13;
â&#128;¢   What has been learned about good practice in each of the main areas of the investment&#13;
    climate?&#13;
â&#128;¢   What role might selective interventions and international arrangements play in improv-&#13;
    ing the investment climate?&#13;
â&#128;¢   What can the international community do to help developing countries improve the&#13;
