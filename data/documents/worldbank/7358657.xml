&amp;#12;&#13;
1.      Country background. Iraq is rich in natural and human resources and was a middle-income&#13;
country in the 1970s. But years of conflict, sanctions and wars have had a significantlynegative effect on&#13;
Iraq's economy with people suffering a severe decline in their standards of living. Although in the 1970s&#13;
the health and educational institutions in Iraq were regarded as among the best in the Middle East, the&#13;
current health and education indicators of Iraq are well below the regional average. An estimated 10&#13;
percent of the population has income of less than a dollar a day, and unemployment is estimated at 25-30&#13;
percent of the population. Accordingto the United Nations, approximately25 percent of the populationis&#13;
dependent on food rations. The agriculture sector has declined and is characterizedby poor productivity&#13;
and ineff~cientwater use. Infrastructure in all sectors, including water and sanitation, is dilapidated and&#13;
mostly dysfunctional. The current political and security environment remains unstable with negative&#13;
impacts on basic services. Rebuildingthe Iraqi economy and institutionsremain a formidablechallenge.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Key environmental issues. Iraq is also facing very serious environmentalproblems, including&#13;
poor water quality, air pollution, waste management, contaminated sites and the deterioration of key&#13;
ecosystems.With environmentalproblems neglected to a large extentprior to the war as well, the decades&#13;
of war, conflicts and economic sanctions have further worsened the environmental conditions. The&#13;
problems are aggravatedby the country's weak environmentalgovernancestructure.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Water quality has been declining because of the discharge of untreated sewage into rivers, the&#13;
increase in salinity from agricultural practices, excess fertilizer leached from agricultural land and&#13;
significantheavy metal and organic pollutants discharged into rivers by the manufacturing industries.Air&#13;
qualityhas been decliningbecause of an obsolete fleet of vehicles, heavytraffic in urban areas, emissions&#13;
from industries (mainly metallurgical, petrochemical &amp; refineries and cement), open burning of solid&#13;
waste and emissions from smelters. Solid waste management capacity in urban areas has weakened over&#13;
last few decades.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Government Response. The Government of Iraq (GoI) establishedthe Ministry of Environment&#13;
(MOEn) in 2003 instead of the Directorate of Environmental Protection and Improvement for supporting&#13;
the environmental management in the country. The annual budget of MOEn for 2006 is about US$7&#13;
millions (covering salaries and operating costs). It consists of 750 staff mostly deployed from other&#13;
Ministries. Of these, 350 are professional staff based in Baghdad and inthe EnvironmentalDirectoratesof&#13;
14 Governorates. The remaining are administrativeand office support staff.A chart of the Ministry of the&#13;
Environment is at Annex 1. Environmental standards, guidelines, monitoring and enforcement,the main&#13;
functions of the Ministry, are almost non-existent. The Government intends to strengthenthe capacity of&#13;
the MOEn and make it effective as quickly as feasible. It also intends to reduce pollution and resource&#13;
wastages, promote clean technologies and educate entrepreneurs and the public about resources&#13;
conservation. The Go1 recognizes the need for administrative reforms, with budgetary and hancial&#13;
discipline, and intends to strengthen the appropriate management structures for the environment&#13;
management at both the national and provinciallevels.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The Go1recognizes the need to start with basic environmental functions (such as monitoring and&#13;
enforcement) and identifying major environmental issues (such as air pollution, water pollution and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
municipal &amp; hazardous waste) as pre-requisites for containing long term environmental problems. With&#13;
the assistance of United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), the Government has prepared the first&#13;
Institutional CapacityAssessment of MOEn (summarized briefly in Annex 1). Go1has also prepared a&#13;
revised Law of Environment Protection and Improvement Number (3) of 1997. The revised law&#13;
emphasizes punitive actions but lacks substantialprovisions for stimulating pollution control and natural&#13;
resource conservation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.       Concerned by the seriousness of environmental deterioration and the weakness of the newly&#13;
created Ministry of Environment, the World Bank and MOEn prepared in 2004 an Emergency&#13;
Environment Management Project for an amount of US$25 million. This project was expected to be&#13;
financed through the Italian Trust Fund (for US$20 million) and through the Iraq Trust fund (ITF) (for&#13;
US$5 million). The earlier project consisted of a capacity building component and an investment&#13;
component. The project was pre-appraised by the World Bank in December 2004 and approved by Iraq's&#13;
Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation on May 23, 2005 (reference no. 85-8ab-2005).&#13;
However, the Italian Trust Fund did not materialize and the project was put on hold. During the&#13;
preparation of the Second Interim Strategyfor Iraq, approved by the Board, the Government of Iraq and&#13;
the World Bank reiterated the importance of strengthening the capacity of the MOEn through an&#13;
environment management project. Accordingly, the project was redesigned to focus on the capacity&#13;
building component for an estimatedUS$5 million. The revised project -which bears the sametitle as the&#13;
previous one - has been discussed with the MOEn and was approved by the Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Development Cooperationon March 29,2006.&#13;
&#13;
7.       The Second Interim Strategy for Iraq supports sector reform agenda on environment, water&#13;
and waste water management, energy, agriculture and drainage and education sectors to be funded&#13;
through the ITF as well as International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and&#13;
International Development Agency (IDA) credit. The environment section of the Second Interim Strategy&#13;
calls for (a)theprovision of training on environment and social safeguards based on the Environment and&#13;
Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) for Iraq, (b) developing and implementing the&#13;
Emergency Environment Management Project (EEMP) and (c) preparing a regional project in Shatt El&#13;
Arab. EEMP is the first environmentaloperation in Iraq. It will complement and support other emergency&#13;
projects under design and implementation, including the water, waste water, energy, education, rural&#13;
roads, irrigation and community development, all of which rely on an enhanced capacity for sustainable&#13;
environmental management. Moreover, although the political and security situation in Iraq is not yet&#13;
settled, it is incumbent upon the World Bank and other donorsthat are financing large scale infrastructure&#13;
projects to help Iraq develop a proper environmental, legal and institutional frameworkto control adverse&#13;
environmental impacts from the reconstructionprocess.&#13;
&#13;
8.       The Bank strongly believes that Iraq's environmentalissues cannot be resolved unless the policy&#13;
and institutionalfailuresare addressed first, proper technicaltools are used and information dissemination&#13;
is introduced. The GoI, at its own initiative, has been trying to strengthen the capacity for environmental&#13;
management and the creation of MOEn as a separate Ministry in 2003 was a step in this direction. But&#13;
environmental protection is a relatively new concern in Iraq, and the Ministry of Environment is still&#13;
striving to establish influence and credibility within the Government. By strengthening the capacity of&#13;
MOEn, the EEMP will bolster the government's initiative. Establishing a solid foundationto MOEn at the&#13;
early stage of the reconstruction process is also likely to have higher effectiveness in shaping its&#13;
organizational ability. While the proposed EEMP investment is relatively small, the benefits from&#13;
building MOEnYscapacityto address environmentalissues will be significantly large in both the short and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
medium term. In the short term, MOEn will be able better prepared to prevent adverse impact to the&#13;
environment fiom large reconstruction projects in Iraq. In the medium term, when the security situation&#13;
settles, MOEn will be in a stronger position to plan and execute large environmentalprotection projects.&#13;
EEMP is designedto address capacity in three key sectors associated with environmentalmanagement -&#13;
air, water and solid-wastemanagement-to enable MOEnto gain comprehensiveexpertise.&#13;
&#13;
9.       The EEMP will not attempt to address all environmental issues facing the country. Rather, it&#13;
will strengthenthe capacity of MOEn in undertaking a few of its core functions. The chosen functions&#13;
shall be relevant in the context of major environmental issues challenging Iraq in the air, water, land and&#13;
waste sectors, and will be tested for effectiveness by selected demonstration activities in a subsequent&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
10.      The EEMP complements donor assistance in the environment sector. Most assistance so far&#13;
has focused primarily on the restoration of the Marshlands. In addition, the World Health Organization&#13;
(WHO) has rehabilitated one of MOEn's buildings and provided water analysis laboratories (for an&#13;
amount of US$2.9 million). Also, UNEP has assisted the MOEn to assess and monitor a number of&#13;
contaminated sites at a cost of US$4.7 million. Whilst such donor support has been helpful, it has not&#13;
addressed some of the core environmentalmanagement issues in Iraq such as establishing environmental&#13;
standards and guidelines, executive regulationsto the laws, monitoring and enforcementmechanisms and&#13;
strengthening the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) capacity. EEMP will address these needs.&#13;
Moreover, the Bank's convening power will likely catalyze future donors' support in the field of&#13;
environment and harmonize donor interventions.&#13;
&#13;
11.      The proposed project is fully consistent with the MOEn's Mandate and Action Plan. It will&#13;
help MOEn address its mandate and key priorities as laid out in its Action Plan of 2005. The Action Plan&#13;
calls for assuring that the people of Iraq have a clean and healthy environmentand that the Ministry will&#13;
adopt and maintain a system of environmental laws, regulations and procedures for protecting the&#13;
environment and conserve its natural resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12.      The project development objective is to strengthen key institutional and regulatory functions of&#13;
the Ministry of Environment. These key institutional and regulatory functions will enable MOEn to&#13;
undertake environmental policy analysis and coordination, formulate laws and regulations, monitor&#13;
environmental quality, promote environmentalawarenessand conducttechnicalstudies&#13;
&#13;
13.      The project is divided into four components as described below. Given the current security&#13;
situationin Iraq, a flexible approach has been adopted in the project design, with following attributes:&#13;
&#13;
       componentshave been designed suchthat they canbe implemented independentlyfrom each other;&#13;
       while respecting the overall objective of the project, activities under each component can be&#13;
       amended after supervision missions by taking into account the field-level experiences during&#13;
       implementation.&#13;
&#13;
The total estimated cost for this proposed project is US$5 million (US$4.7 million + US$0.3 million in&#13;
contingencies). Detailedproject costs are given in Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
Component 1 - Strengthen the Environmental Management Capacity of the Ministry of&#13;
Environment (USS0.9 million)&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14.     The objective of this component is to strengthen the environmental management capacity of&#13;
MOE~'.It will focus on four key environmental functions of the Ministry of Environment:&#13;
&#13;
(i) Policy formulationthrough the preparation of an Environment Action Plan for Iraq. The objective of&#13;
this plan is to analyze environmentalissues in Iraq and propose priorities for environmentalintervention&#13;
in the next 3-5 years. The Plan will be achievedby:&#13;
         (a) providing consultancy servicesto environmental experts on policy formulation;&#13;
         (b) training and study tours for MOEn staff on preparation of environmental action plans and&#13;
             environmentalplanning; and&#13;
         (c) organizing workshops among key stakeholders to reach consensus on elements of the action&#13;
             plan.&#13;
&#13;
(ii) Strengthening the regulatory fitnetion of MOEn. The objective of this subcomponent is to assist&#13;
MOEn in revising the Law of Environmental Protection and Improvement; preparing andlor revising&#13;
executive regulations related to key sectors (such as EIA, air, water, wastewater, soil); preparing&#13;
standards and guidelines on EIA, ambient air and water quality, emissions and discharges of water and&#13;
wastewater, and chemical safety management. This will be achievedthrough:&#13;
         (a) the provision of 1ocaVinternationalconsultantsfor preparation,revision of law and executive&#13;
             regulations, and preparation of guidelines;&#13;
         (b) conductingtraining programs for local officers,judges and lawyers;&#13;
         (c) conducting training and study tours on the preparation and supervision of EIA for MOEn&#13;
             staff of at least 4 governorates (such as: Baghdad, Basra, Mosul and Najaf), highlighting the&#13;
             methodologyfor undertakingESSAF assessment;&#13;
         (d) undertaking awareness workshops on the implementation of the Environmental Law for&#13;
             NGOs, and private sector; and&#13;
         (e) undertakingworkshop on chemical safetymanagement.&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Strengthening the monitoring and enforcement capacity of the Ministry. One of the main&#13;
recommendations of UNEP's Institutional CapacityAssessment is to improve MOEnYslaw making and&#13;
inspection capabilities.As such this sub-componentwill develop inspection manuals and provide on-the-&#13;
job training to environmentalinspectors.This will enableMOEn to better monitorthe polluting industries&#13;
and enforce environmentallaws. The strengthening of the monitoring and enforcement capacity will be&#13;
achievedby:&#13;
         (a) providing consultancy services for the development of inspection manuals and procedures,&#13;
             and&#13;
         (b) providing training for environmentalinspectors on monitoring and enforcement.&#13;
&#13;
(iv) Raising environmentalawareness among school children. Current environmentalawareness is weak&#13;
in Iraq and MOEn is keen to address this issue. This component will, therefore, focus on raising&#13;
awareness among school children through targeted educational activities in about 50 pilot schools for&#13;
improving their understanding of the potential consequences of environmental pollution and encouraging&#13;
environment £riendly behavior. The selection of schools for awareness programs will be made by the&#13;
PMT and will be based on (a) academic reputation of the school, (b) ability of the PMT to monitor the&#13;
awareness program in the locality, and (c) availability of teachers with science background and exposure&#13;
to environmentalissues. Any prior initiativetaken by the school for raising environmentalawareness will&#13;
count favorably for selection. This sub-component will serve as a pilot to be replicated in future projects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1This componentbuilds ontheInstitutional CapacifyAssessment of MOEnpreparedby UNEP in 2006, as summary&#13;
of which is availablein Annex 1.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in other schools across the country. This will ensure that environmental protection and conservation is&#13;
ingrained in the minds of the younger generation.The creationof awareness will be achieved by:&#13;
         (a) purchasing and preparing environmental awareness tools and material (such as leaflets)&#13;
              targeted at schoolchildrento promote environmental messages. ;and&#13;
         (b) undertaking awareness campaigns. Besides printing leaflets and banners, the average&#13;
              allocation of US$3,000 per school will be spent on organizing awareness campaigns through&#13;
              skits, plays and poster-making, debates and guest lectures. These events will be spread over&#13;
              two to three years following a scheduleto be finalizedby the PMT.&#13;
&#13;
Component2 -Develop Capacity in Environmental Monitoring (USs2.6 million)&#13;
&#13;
15.      The objective of this componentis to strengthenthe environmental quality monitoring function of&#13;
MOEn. It will focus on (i) installing air quality monitoring network in 3 cities in Iraq and (ii) assisting&#13;
MOEn in improving coordination,collectionand disclosureof data on water quality.&#13;
&#13;
(i) Air Quality Monitoring: The objective of this sub-component is to establish an air quality monitoring&#13;
network in Iraq's three largest cities- Baghdad, Mosul and Basra. The deteriorationof air quality is a key&#13;
public health issue. As determinedby the Decision Support Study commissioned by the World ~ a n kthe               ~ ,&#13;
major contributorsto urban air pollution are: an obsolete fleet of vehicles (using either leaded or diesel&#13;
fuel), heavy traffic in urban areas, emissions fiom heavy industries (mainly metallurgical, petrochemical&#13;
and refineries and cementplants), as well as open burning of solid waste and emissionsfiom smelters.As&#13;
such there is a mounting recognition in Iraq for the need of effective air quality management. MOEn is&#13;
the primary institution responsible for air quality monitoring but has limited capacity. In the absence of&#13;
air quality management system, MOEn lacks data essential for designing sound policies for air pollution&#13;
control and raising public awareness. The design of this sub component is based on a Need Assessments&#13;
for Air QualifyMonitoring commissioned duringthe preparation of this project3.The sub-component will&#13;
consist of&#13;
&#13;
          (a) Purchasing and installing 15 fixed station and 3 mobile monitoring stations for the cities of&#13;
              Baghdad, Basra and Mosul. These stations will be equipped with necessaly gas and&#13;
              particulate analyzers, meteorological sensors and calibrators. Stations in each city will be&#13;
              linked to a central location at MOEn offices where the data will be compiled, analyzed and&#13;
              reported.&#13;
&#13;
          (b) Developing an air quality database. This database will enable MOEn to inform the public at&#13;
              large about air quality in each city, its impact on public health, and mitigating behavior that&#13;
              could be adopted to minimize and protect from air pollution. It will also be shared with other&#13;
              sector ministries (industry, transport, public works, etc.,) to enable them to develop a&#13;
              pollution control strategyandtackle the most pressing air pollution issues. It will also provide&#13;
              information on pollutant concentrations as a basis for assessing their likely impact on the&#13;
              health of the exposed population.&#13;
&#13;
          (c) Providing training to MOEn staff in all three cities to enable them to conduct routine site&#13;
              visits to all monitoring stations to perform site and equipment inspection, maintenance,&#13;
              analyzer calibration, and station inter-calibration. Training will also be provided in data&#13;
              processing in order to transformthe collectedraw data by appropriatevalidation, analysis and&#13;

             policy planners, healthprofessionals and public end-users.&#13;
&#13;
(ii) Surface Water Quality Monitoring: The objective of this sub-component is to assist the MOEn in&#13;
improving coordination, collection and disclosure of data on surface water quality in part of the Tigris&#13;
River passing through Baghdad.This is becausethere aie substantial amounts of data availableon surface&#13;
water quality but they are largely fragmented and inconsistent. The responsibility for water quality&#13;
monitoring is shared between MOEn and the Ministry of Water Resources, without clear demarcation of&#13;
roles and mandates (for further information refer to Annex 6). This subcomponent will facilitate the&#13;
coordination of surface water quality information primarily between the Ministries of Environment and&#13;
Water Resources. Surfacewater quality data will be limitedto part of the Tigris passing through Baghdad.&#13;
This will be achievedthrough:&#13;
&#13;
         (a) purchasing portable equipment to assist MOEn with surface water quality monitoring data&#13;
             collection;&#13;
         (b) providing the services of an individual consultant to analyze existing water quality data,&#13;
             consolidatethem and publish them on MOEn's website;&#13;
         (c) organizing working group meetings between all relevant sector ministries to coordinate and&#13;
             consolidatedata information; and&#13;
         (d) developing a Surface Water Quality web page on the MOEn's website. This website will&#13;
             include water quality monitoring data from different sources. MOEn will encourage all&#13;
             stakeholders to disclose as much information as possible so that the site will develop into a&#13;
             usehl information source for the scientificcommunityand the public at large.&#13;
&#13;
Items (c) and (d) will be funded by MOEn as part of its contributionto the project.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3 -Strengthen Technical Capacity in Waste Management (USS0.8 million)&#13;
&#13;
16.      The objective of this component is to strengthenthe technical capacity of MOEn for carrying out&#13;
pre-investment studies in municipal and healthcare waste management. These studies will prepare the&#13;
ground for the Mayorality of Baghdad and the Ministry of Health to carry out investments in waste&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
17.      This componentaddresses and fixes the urgent needs of Baghdad city to deal with municipal and&#13;
healthcare wastes generated on a regular basis and in large quantities. The hazardous nature of municipal&#13;
and healthcare wastes poses major health and environmental concerns to the citizens on a daily basis.&#13;
Three studies will be undertaken by MOEn.&#13;
&#13;
(i) Two studies on municipal waste management will be conducted with the technical collaboration of the&#13;
Mayoralty of Baghdad. These are;&#13;
&#13;
         (a) Municipal SolidWaste Master Plan for Baghdad: The objective of this masterplan is to:&#13;
      -    Analyze and evaluate the current solid waste management system as well as existing&#13;
           institutional, legal and financial framework;&#13;
      -    Develop techno-economical options to improve solid waste management services (collection,&#13;
           transfer, .treatmentand disposal);&#13;
      -    Consult with appropriatestakeholderto selectthe most appropriate option;&#13;
      -    Develop a detailed investment plan for the selected option (the investment plan should&#13;
           encourageprivate sector participation);&#13;
      -    Prepareguidelines for landfill site selection;&#13;
      -    Identifytraining needs to implementthe investmentplan; and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      -   Providetraining workshop on integrated solid waste management.&#13;
&#13;
         (b) A Study on the Rehabilitation and/or Closure of two priority Uncontrolled Dump Sites in&#13;
        Baghdad - possibly: Ammary (about 2 million m3) and Sabiyat (about 1 million m3) in Al-Taji&#13;
        area.This study will assess the current situation at these dumps from the geological, hydrological,&#13;
         environmental, social and technical point of view; develop a techno-economic study for the&#13;
        appropriate rehabilitation and/or closure of these dumps; prepare the technical specification for&#13;
        their rehabilitationand/or closure.&#13;
&#13;
(ii) The third study on healthcare waste management will be conducted in collaborationwith the Ministry&#13;
of Health. It will constitute an Assessment and Action Plan for Health Care Waste Management for&#13;
Baghdad Medical Complex Center (which consists of 12medical institutions) and Al-Yarmouk Hospital.&#13;
The objective of this study is to assess the existing waste management practices of the Center, determine&#13;
the waste generation rates and waste composition, and on this basis develop an action plan to improve the&#13;
waste management practices of the center. The action plan will propose an improved system for&#13;
collecting, storing, transferring, treating and disposing waste. It will alsoprioritize necessaryinvestments.&#13;
&#13;
18.      These studies will be fully funded by the proposed Grant. MOEn will be responsible for&#13;
contracting. A working group has already been established between MOEn, the Mayorality of Baghdad&#13;
and the Ministry of Health. The role of the working group is to (a) prepare and agree on the terms of&#13;
reference of the studies; and (b) followup onthe studiesprogress and provide guidanceto the consultants.&#13;
Once completed, these studies will enable the Mayorality and the Ministry of Health to carry out&#13;
investments in waste management.&#13;
&#13;
Component 4 -Establish a Project Management Team (USS0.4 million)&#13;
&#13;
19.      A Project Management Team (PMT) will be responsible for managing, coordinating and&#13;
monitoring all components of the project. The PMT has already been officially established through&#13;
Administrative Order no. 1245 dated 21 June 2006. The PMT will includethe following staff:&#13;
         o A ProjectDirector (who is alsothe DeputyMinister)&#13;
         o A Project Manager&#13;
         o A procurement specialist&#13;
         o A financial specialist;&#13;
         o An environment specialist, with solid background in environmental law, standards and public&#13;
             awareness, responsible for Component 1.&#13;
         o An air quality specialist responsiblefor Component 2;&#13;
         o   A waste management specialistresponsiblefor Component 3:&#13;
         o A project assistant.&#13;
&#13;
20.      All the above staff are current employees of the MOEn. The project will finance the recruitment&#13;
of additional short-term experts outside the ministry on an as-needed basis to complement the technical&#13;
capacityof the team.&#13;
&#13;
21.      This project will also finance training and capacity building for all PMT staff in both technical&#13;
and fiduciary (procurement and financial) management. As long as the situation prevents supervision&#13;
missionto be carried out in Iraq, the project will finance all expenditureforthe travel of PMT members to&#13;
attend supervision meetings in nearby cities, such as Amman or Beirut.&#13;
&#13;
22.      The project will also finance the purchase of all necessary equipment (furniture, computers, etc.)&#13;
to enablethe PMT to implement the project. It will also financethe purchasing or renting of cars.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV.     INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS PROJECT         AND              IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
Project Management&#13;
&#13;
23.     The project will be implemented over 4 years. Project activities are expected ordabout October&#13;
2007 and should be completedby September of 2010. Because ofthe lack of familiarity with World Bank&#13;
fiduciary guidelines, the Project Management Team will be encouraged to coordinate and learn from&#13;
PMTs working on other Bank-funded projects.&#13;
&#13;
24.     In order to facilitate the implementation of the project, the Minister will delegate power&#13;
authorizing procurement and disbursement decisions to the Deputy Minister for Technical Affairs. The&#13;
Project Manager reports directly to the Deputy Minister for Technical Affairs. The MOEn will make&#13;
available for the project at least 2-3 offices.&#13;
&#13;
25.     The PMT has officially been established through Administrative Order no. 1245 issued on 21&#13;
June 2006. The PMT will report directlyto the Deputy Minister for Technical Affairs.&#13;
&#13;
26.     PMT staff will coordinatethe implementation of this project with other MOEn units, especially&#13;
the Directorate General of Planning and Technical Follow-up, the Directorate General of Baghdad&#13;
Environment, the Directorate General of Governorate Affairs, the Center for Technical Information, the&#13;
Council for Environmental Consultation and Coordination and the Center for Information and Public&#13;
Awareness (see Annex 1). In addition, they will have to coordinate with the Solid Waste Department of&#13;
the Mayorality of Baghdad and the Ministry of Health for Component 3, as well as various institutions&#13;
working on water qualityfor Component 2.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement&#13;
&#13;
27.     Procurement for this project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines:Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, "Guidelines: Selection&#13;
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the provisions&#13;
stipulated in the Trust Fund Grant Agreement. The general description of various items under different&#13;
expenditure categories is given in Annex 4. For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the&#13;
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and&#13;
time frame are reflected in the Procurement Plan (PP). The PP will be updated at least annually or as&#13;
required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. A&#13;
General Procurement Notice has been published in Dg Market on August 29, 2006 and in UN&#13;
Development Business. In additionprocurement procedures and sample bidding documents can be found&#13;
in the Master ImplementationManual (MIM).&#13;
&#13;
28.     To expedite the implementation, the first bidding documents for air quality monitoring stations&#13;
has been prepared by the Project Management Team and sent to the Bank for No Objection prior to&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
29.     High Risk - Weak Control Environment. Iraq's ability to manage public resources is&#13;
undermined by poor security and outdated administrative practices. Moreover, Iraq is ranked poorly on&#13;
TransparencyInternational's CorruptionPerception Index, the lowest of all countriesin the Region. There&#13;
are reports from the auditors of the US Government Accountability Office and the auditors of the Office&#13;
of the Commission on Public Integrity (published in the media) that significant amounts of h d s cannot&#13;
be accounted for or the spendingcannotbe backed up with sufficient documentation. The audit alsofound&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
that its efforts were hampered by rampant disorganization and poor bookkeeping and that contract files&#13;
were LLunavailable,incomplete, inconsistent and unreliable." As part of risk mitigation in the project, the&#13;
following measurements were consideredin the design of the operation and for the implementation of the&#13;
project:&#13;
&#13;
    -    Design the operations and procurement packaging with increased attentionto mitigatethe risk of&#13;
         weak control environment;&#13;
    -    Devote greater supervisionattentionat the project level; e.g. lower the prior review threshold and&#13;
         conduct ex-post procurement reviews fi-equently;&#13;
    -    Use the services of the Fiduciary Monitoring Agent, appointedby the Bank, to conduct fiduciary&#13;
         monitoring of this project includingspotphysical inspection;&#13;
    -    Ensure that the client fi-om the start establish a good record keeping for all procurement and&#13;
         contractmanagement and develop a good filing system;&#13;
    -    Train PMT staff and the designated procurement officer, in particular, on sound procurement&#13;
         practices followingthe ethics and code of conduct required by the implementingagency;&#13;
    -    Inform the PMT as well as the private sector on the procedures the Bank takes in case of&#13;
         allegations of corruption;&#13;
    -    A Bank local procurement consultant who is on the ground will closely supervise procurement&#13;
         activities;&#13;
    -    Limit the use of non competitive procedures in procurement of goods and services as well as in&#13;
         consultants' selections;&#13;
    -    The Bank is now engaged with the government in supporting the reform of the public&#13;
         procurement sector which will include, as part of the reform drafting, a unified public&#13;
         procurement law.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
&#13;
30.      The proposed Grant of US$5.0 million is expectedto be disbursedby September 2010~.Table 5.1&#13;
in Annex 5 describes the allocation of the Grant proceeds accordingto each expenditurecategory.&#13;
&#13;
31.      The Bank's strategy is to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen institutional capacity by&#13;
financing operations that are implementedby Iraqi ministries and other recipient entities. Trained Project&#13;
PMTs are established to facilitate implementation and help ensure compliance with fiduciary and other&#13;
safeguards. PMTs are employed and paid by the implementing agency at regular salary levels, thereby&#13;
avoiding the disadvantages of stand-alone Project Implementation Units that can potentially erode civil&#13;
service institutional capacity over the medium and long term. The Project will finance specialized&#13;
technical support in procurement, financialmanagement and other areas, as needed. In addition,to ensure&#13;
that project h d s are used for the purposes intended and to help carry out project supervision on the&#13;
ground in Iraq, the Bank has hired an independentfirmas FiduciaryMonitoring Agent (FMA).&#13;
&#13;
32.      As a further compensatingcontrol, disbursementswill be made primarily through direct payment&#13;
by the Bank to the consultants and vendors. Once authorizedby the MOEn, directpayments will be made&#13;
by the World Bank into the account of the consultant, or vendor in a commercial bank capable of&#13;
receivingfunds transferredinternationally.&#13;
&#13;
33.      Disbursements for the project management component and payments below the threshold of&#13;
US$20,000 normally will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own resources. These&#13;
&#13;
 The project closing dates assumesthat the ITF termination date (currently set at December 31,2007) will be extendedby until&#13;
December 31, 2010. Should the TIT termination date not be extended, the Recipient would need to seek additional sources of&#13;
fmancing for completingthe project's activities.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
payments made fiom the Recipient's own resources will be reimbursed, on a periodic basis, by the Bank&#13;
to the MOEn upon presentation of full supporting documents, proof of payment and a signed withdrawal&#13;
application. The Bank may later require the use of Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for payments below&#13;
US$20,000. The PMT and the main financial counterparts fiom the MOEn will be provided intensive&#13;
training in Bank disbursementprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
34.      The project financial resources are extended through the ITF and will be managed within the&#13;
framework of the MOEn systems, regulations and controls. A financial management assessment was&#13;
undertaken remotely, through meetings with MOEn representatives to assess the MOEn financial&#13;
management system and to determine the arrangements to be adopted in order to enhance the existing&#13;
controls and fulfill the reporting requirement of the project.&#13;
&#13;
35.      Based on the results of the assessment and the outcome of the various reports issued by&#13;
independent auditors and other donors, the fiduciary risk of the Grant not being used for the intended&#13;
purposes - with due regard to economy, efficiency and the sustainable achievement of the project's&#13;
development- is considered as high. The financialmanagement risk as an element of the fiduciary risk is&#13;
also high.&#13;
&#13;
36. This financialmanagementrisk will be partly managedthrough:&#13;
    -    reinforcingthe present controlsas applied by the MOEn;&#13;
    -    providing intensivetraining in financialmanagement;&#13;
    -    making most payments directlyto consultants and vendors;&#13;
    -    maintaining a fixed assets register and spreadsheet for purchased and delivered equipment;&#13;
    -    using a spreadsheet applicationto keep track of the project accounts and to generate the project&#13;
         reports;&#13;
    -    having a FMA inside Iraq to monitor the project activitiesand to supportthe PMT;&#13;
    -    engagement of an independent auditor, with international experience acceptable to the Bank, to&#13;
         perform the project audit and issue an independentauditor's opinion;&#13;
    -    documenting FM arrangements in a chapter of the Project Implementation Manual (PIM) based&#13;
         on the Master Implementation Manual and have the roles and responsibilities of the PMT&#13;
         members clearlyspecified; and&#13;
    -    in addition, the residual risk, where possible, will be managed during project implementation&#13;
         through close monitoring and supervisionby the project Financial Officer&#13;
&#13;
37. The financial management-related risks and risk-managementtools are reflected in Annex 5.&#13;
&#13;
Project Supervision&#13;
&#13;
38.      Supervisionwill be carried out by the Bank team, the Bank's local consultants and the Fiduciary&#13;
Monitoring Agent. Since travel to Iraq is difficult under current circumstances, supervision will be&#13;
centered on a detailedresults-basedanalysis and is planned as follows:&#13;
&#13;
      (i) Quarterly progress reports: The PMT will send the Bank a quarterly progress report. The&#13;
           format will be agreed with the PMT at the start of the project and will detail the progress on&#13;
           each of the projects' components. For the air quality component, digital photo documentation&#13;
           will also be required.&#13;
&#13;
      (ii) The Fiduciary Monitoring Agent reports: On a monthly basis, the FMA will produce a&#13;
           ProcurementReport and a Financial Report.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    (iii) Supervision missions: The Bank team will try to meet with the PMT every four months for the&#13;
          first year, and depending on the progress of the work, will meet every six months in subsequent&#13;
          years. In the meantime, every two weeks audio conference will be established with the PMT to&#13;
          follow up project progress.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
39.     The Bank, as the Iraq Trust Fund Administrator, will supervise ITF-funded operations in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. While staff travel to Iraq is restricted,&#13;
supervision of recipient-executed operations will be carried out through consultants and the Fiduciary&#13;
MonitoringAgent (FMA).&#13;
&#13;
40.     Reporting to Donors: The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of&#13;
the finds depositedby the donors with the Bank underthe ITF. Within ninety (90) days of the end of each&#13;
quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 3l), the Bank will prepare, on a cash basis, an&#13;
un-audited statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a&#13;
copyto each donor. Each such statementwill be expressedin United StatesDollars, the currencyin which&#13;
the ITF funds will be maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one hundred and eighty (180) days of&#13;
the completion of all disbursements relating to activities financed from the ITF, the Bank will prepare on&#13;
a cash basis an un-audited financial statement of receipts, disbursements, and find balance with respectto&#13;
the ITF and forward a copyto each donor.&#13;
&#13;
41.     The Bank will furnish the donors:&#13;
      (i) on a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of the ITF (including&#13;
          contributions, disbursements,and implementationprogress) in the preceding six months; and&#13;
     (ii) on an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation from the Bank's&#13;
   '&#13;
&#13;
          external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial&#13;
          reporting for the trust fund as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
42.      The Bank will require a financial statement audit of the ITF to be performed by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors on an annual basis. The costs of such an audit, including the internal costs of the Bank&#13;
with respect to the audit, will be charged to the ITF. The Bank will provide each donor with a copy of the&#13;
auditor's report.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
43.      This is a Category C project. It entails almost no physical works and has no negative&#13;
environmental impacts. This project will actually contribute to strengthen the capacity of MOEn in&#13;
monitoring and supervising EnvironmentalImpact Assessment (EIA). It will alsotrain MOEn staff in the&#13;
use of the Environment and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) to ensurethat World&#13;
Bank-financedprojects in Iraq follow minimum due diligence in managing environmentaland social risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 V.      FINANCIAL ECONOMIC&#13;
                        AND                    JUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
44.      The total estimated cost for this proposed project is US$5 million. A detailedbreakdown of costs&#13;
can be found in Annex 2. A technical assistance project does not usually require an economic analysis,&#13;
because of the difficulty involved in quantifyingproject benefits. Although no attempt has been made to&#13;
quantify those benefits and to estimatethe project economic rate of return, a brief qualitative description&#13;
of the potentialbenefits is provided.&#13;

45.     Component 1- Strengthen the Environmental Management Capacity of the MOEn: By&#13;
strengtheningthe legal, regulatoryand EIA capacity of MOEn, the project will ensure that reconstruction&#13;
projects - particularly those financed by the World Bank - do not further exacerbate the degradation of&#13;
the environment in Iraq, but ensure minimum due diligence in managing environmentaland social risks.&#13;
The benefits of a robust ministry with clear standards, rules and regulations and strong monitoring and&#13;
enforcement capacities are huge interms of both preventing further deterioration of environmentalquality&#13;
and workingtowards the conservation and protection of a healthy and clean environment.&#13;
&#13;
46.     In addition, the benefits of the pilot awareness campaigntargeted at school children are likely to&#13;
be important in the long run. The campaign will be expanded by the MOEn to cover other schools if the&#13;
response is found encouraging.Althoughthe direct benefits of this campaign will not be observableinthe&#13;
short-term, the activities will have positive impact in the long-term with children imbibing the values of&#13;
environmental protection and conservation. As the schools will be selected on the basis of academic&#13;
achievements, students from these schools are expected to occupypositions of influence in later life, thus&#13;
helpingto shape future policies favorableto environmental conservation.Most importantly, children have&#13;
direct stakes on environmental issues because the continuing degradations will likely manifest very&#13;
adversely by the time the current students have reached adulthood. Raising awareness among them will&#13;
help attenuate environmental degradationasthe new generationmatures.&#13;
&#13;
47.     Component 2 - Develop Capacity in Environmental Monitoring: Investing in air and water&#13;
quality monitoring will positively impact public health. Assuming that the proposed project will be used&#13;
by GO1 as part of a larger strategy on pollution control, incremental benefits - above and beyond those&#13;
from the pollution control programs - are likely to occur. A good air quality monitoring network,&#13;
managed by well-trained technicians and yielding credible monitoring data, will allow policy makers to&#13;
better target pollution control investments and increasethe efficiency of pollution control measures.&#13;
&#13;
48.     Component 3 - Strengthen Technical Capacity in Waste Management: Soil and water&#13;
contamination fiom improper municipal and healthcare waste management is a major environmental&#13;
concern facing the day to day life of Iraqi citizens. Preparing a municipal and healthcare waste&#13;
managementplan will set the agenda for futuregovernment investmentin this sector.When the municipal&#13;
waste master plan for Baghdad is eventually implemented, the existing transfer and dump site closed&#13;
andforrehabilitated, a treatment facility constructed to serve the Baghdad Medical Complex Center, the&#13;
potentialhealth and environmentalbenefits will be enormous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VI.     POTENTIALRISKS&#13;
&#13;
49.     The Bank's Second Interim Strategy highlights the high and unprecedented risks of working in&#13;
Iraq and the need for flexibility in project design. The table below identifies the main risks posed as well&#13;
as the mitigation measures to be adopted. Procurement and financial management risks are identified in&#13;
Annexes 4 and 5 respectively.&#13;

MOEn background information&#13;
&#13;
Although the Ministry of Environment in Iraq was established in 2003, the country had a system of&#13;
environmentalgovernance and monitoring much prior to that. A Human EnvironmentDirectoratewas set&#13;
up in 1972 under the Ministry of Health following the UN Conference on Human Environment. An&#13;
environment law was enacted and an Environment Protection Centre established under the Muustry of&#13;
Health in 1986. In 1997, this centre was transformed into the Environment Protection and Improvement&#13;
Directorate (EPID) which by 2001 was vested with broader mandate and greater responsibility for&#13;
addressing environmental issues. EPID was disassociated from the Ministry of Health and designated as&#13;
an independent body. The duties of this Directoratewere carried out through the EnvironmentProtection&#13;
and Improvement Council (EPIC), which consisted of government and non-government representatives.&#13;
The decisions of EPIC required endorsementby the Council of Ministers.&#13;
&#13;
Although technically an independent body, EPID, in reality, continuedto depend for its operation on the&#13;
Ministry of Health. In fact, subsequent to conflicts in 2003, EPID re-integrated with the Ministry of&#13;
Health for administrative and budgetary convenience. Eventually, in 2003, the Ministry of Environment&#13;
was created as an independentMinistryby the CoalitionProvisional Authority.&#13;
&#13;
Since its creation in 2003, MOEn has been in a state of continual transition, with three Ministers&#13;
appointed during this short period. Each Minister has reshuffled MOEn's core management team. The&#13;
latest organization chart given above shows the current structure of MOEn. As evident from the chart,&#13;
MOEn is organizedgeographically,thematicallyand administratively.&#13;
&#13;
MOEn has 14regional offices      - one in each of the governorates, except the autonomous Kurdish region.&#13;
The head office is in Baghdad, which has the greatestnumber of staff and expertise.With about 750 staff&#13;
(of which 350 are professional), human resource is one of MOEn's principal strength. MOEn staffs are&#13;
technically competent, show a good diversity of technical background, and have received training from&#13;
several internationalorganizations in the last two years. The Ministry also has a good mix of permanent&#13;
and contractual staff, and continues to implement national and international projects during this&#13;
challengingperiod.&#13;
&#13;
Summary of UNEP9sInstitutional Capacity~ssessmen                               f'&#13;
&#13;
In 2004, UNEP, undertook an Institutional Capacity Assessment of MOEn (hereafter referred to as the&#13;
assessment). It also upgraded some of MOEn's infrastructure and provided training to its staff.&#13;
Component 1 of the Emergency Environment Management Project builds on the hdings and&#13;
recommendations UNEP's Institutional CapacityAssessment.&#13;
&#13;
The assessment reveals that, while working under a state of political flux, security constraints and&#13;
resource limitations, the Ministry has nevertheless managed to establish its presence, train its staff,&#13;
improve some of its infrastructure and undertake a few projects. The assessment also reveals that the&#13;
Ministry currently undertakes all aspects of environmental management: from law making to law&#13;
enforcement and environmental monitoring. However its core strength is in environmentalmonitoring,&#13;
due to its historical background as the monitoring arm of the Ministry of Health. The major challenges&#13;
are in resource limitation for undertaking inspections and enforcing legislation. It concluded that&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
strengthening the law making and enforcement and inspection capabilities are areas which need&#13;
management attention.&#13;
&#13;
The assessment also states that, like in all other areas, the needs in Iraq in the environmental field are&#13;
enormous. Therefore, there is a need to focus management attention and precious resources on few key&#13;
areas over the next few years. The assessment found that setting up a process to agree on key national&#13;
priorities, preparing a national environmental action plan to address these priority areas and executing&#13;
them as projects would assist the ministry in targeting its resources in such a way that tangible changes&#13;
could be observed in limited time.&#13;
&#13;
MOEn Mission Statement:&#13;
&#13;
The following is reproduced from the UNEP Institutional Capacity assessment rePo&amp;which summarizes&#13;
the         Mission Statement of MOEn. Although the mission statement is not legally recognized and&#13;
enforceable, it captures the fundamental intent of the Ministry in its approachto execute its mandate. The&#13;
draft Mission Statement ofthe MOEN is:&#13;
&#13;
'To assure that thepeople of Iraq and their heirs have a clean and healthfil environmentwhere they may&#13;

         stable environment. People must respect the environment and can do so only if they are aware&#13;
         that most of their daily actions affectsthat environment.&#13;
&#13;
    o    The Ministry shall adopt and maintain a system of environmental laws, regulations and&#13;

servants will be financed under the project. Operating costs that will be financed by the project will be&#13;
procured using MOEnYsadministrativeprocedures for shopping satisfactoryto the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement&#13;
&#13;
In 2005, the World Bank conducted an Operational Procurement Review (OPR) of the public&#13;
procurement system in Iraq to help enhance the Bank's lcnowledge of the overall procurement system in&#13;
Iraq. The OPR revealed that procurement environmentwhichprevailed in Iraq duringthe last two decades&#13;
was different fiom the norms of acceptable international practice. The major issue facing public&#13;
procurement now in Iraq is the uncertainty of public procurement laws and regulations that causes high&#13;
risk in weak control environment. The risk is essentially rooted in the lack of good laws and regulations,&#13;
modem standard documentation, lack of trained staff for procurement using Bank guidelines and&#13;
internationalsoundprocurementpractice, and poor law enforcement capacity in the country. Presentlythe&#13;
Bank is engaged in supporting the Iraqi government in reforming of public procurement system and&#13;
developing standard national bidding documents in coordination with the Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Development Cooperation&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In addition, an assessmentof MOEn's capacity to implement project procurement was conducted in May&#13;
2006 by the Bank's local procurement consultantthrough discussion with MOEn staff in Baghdad before&#13;
the pre-appraisavappraisal mission and reviewed by the team's Senior Procurement Specialist. The&#13;
assessment showed that MOEn had been established vide provisional coalition authority memorandum&#13;
no. (44) issued on November 11, 2003. At present MOEn consists of fifteen Directorates with a&#13;
workforce of 750 staff, both permanent and contractual,distributed all over the countryand there is some&#13;
management formationin process.&#13;
&#13;
The new established ministry's experience in procurement can be summarized as follows: (a) For&#13;
procurement of goods: the ministry had carried out 4 local contracts in the value of about US$1.2 million&#13;
for labs equipments and materials; (b) For procurement of work: one work contract had been carried and&#13;
it is under implementation in the value of about US$50,000; and (c) for Consultancy services only two&#13;
contracts for design inthe value of US$60,000.&#13;
&#13;
The assessment showed that MOEn has no specialized department for procurement and it implements&#13;
procurement through its different departments facilitated through the legal department that employs 10&#13;
para-legal staff and one lawyer, responsible for advertisement and coordination of procurement activities&#13;
with differentdepartments.However, MOEn has a centralized bid openings committee and bid evaluation&#13;
committeewith members rotating every 6 months.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the existing information on the overall environment for procurement in Iraq and in particular&#13;
within MOEn, the overall procurement risk is assessed as high, which therefore requires the assignment&#13;
of a dedicated and qualified procurement officer to the project, as well as the provision of intensive&#13;
formal and on-the-job training to the PMT on procurement and project management. In addition, the MIM&#13;
and PIM are expectedto provide significantguidanceto PMT procurement staff.&#13;

Frequency of Procurement Supervision&#13;
&#13;
Based on the capacity assessment of MOEn, at least one supervision mission is planned every four&#13;
months, in addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, to ensure that&#13;
MOEn is following the Procurement guidelines and procedures during implementation. Until security&#13;
conditions make travel to Iraq possible for international Bank staff, the Bank will use the services of a&#13;
Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA). The FMA is an independent firm that operates within Iraq; it will&#13;
support the Bank in carrying out its supervision function, including spot physical inspection. In addition,&#13;
the Bank will rely on reports fromthe local World Bank procurement consultantbased in Iraq. Duringthe&#13;
interim period, Bank staff and the concerned Iraqi procurement staff will meet outside Iraq to carry out&#13;
off-site supervision. They will also rely on regular audio conferenceto maintain effective communication&#13;
onthe progress of the project.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendations and Action Plan to Build the Agencies Capacity&#13;
&#13;
      A procurement officer was assigned to the PMT to be responsible for all procurement aspects&#13;
       during implementation. This officer will receive both formal and ad-hoc procurement training on&#13;
       efficient handling ofthe procurement activitiesunder the project;.&#13;
       Training sessions will be organizedthroughout project implementation.Thetarget audienceis PMT&#13;
       staff, and other employees ofthe MOEn involved in procurement;&#13;
       A PIM will be prepared on the basis of the MIM to provide standard procurement documents,&#13;
       evaluation reports, progress reports, filing requirements that will be followed throughout project&#13;
       implementation;&#13;
       The thresholds for prior review by the Bank are set at a low level, to allow Bank staff to provide&#13;
       hands-on training to staff ofthe PMT;&#13;
  0    A Project Launch Workshop, attended by all project stakeholders, will be held in Arabic (or with&#13;
       Arabic translation) soon after Grant signing.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Plan&#13;
MOEn at pre-appraisal developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation which provides the&#13;
basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed betweenthe MOEn and the Project Team at&#13;
negotiations and is available below. It will also be available in the Project's database and in the Bank's&#13;
external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the PMT annually, or as&#13;
required,to reflectthe actual project implementationneeds and improvementsin institutional capacity.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

A. Financial Mana~ement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FMAssessment&#13;
&#13;
An assessment of the financial management (FM) arrangements at MOEn and those proposed for the&#13;
project was completed, remotely, during meetings in Beinrt, Lebanon.The purpose of the assessmentwas&#13;
to determine whether these arrangements were acceptableto the Bank in providing reasonable fiduciary&#13;
assurance that the proceeds of the Grant are used for the purposes of the project with due regard to&#13;
economy, efficiency. The documentation of the assessment is availablein the project files.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the result of the assessment, the FM risk, as a component of the fiduciary risk, and which is a&#13;
combination of country, sector and project specific factors is high. In light of the Bank Second Interim&#13;
Strategy Note covering ITF and IDA-financed projects executed by the Iraqi Government, the project&#13;
financial resources, extended through the Grant, will be managed through the framework of MOEn&#13;
financial systems, regulations, and controls. Consequently, a number of measures will be introduced to&#13;
mitigatethe weaknesses identified. Paragraph 5 below reflects a summary of the MOEn FM arrangements&#13;
reviewed.&#13;

&#13;
A Country Financial AccountabilityAssessment (CFAA) has not yet been undertaken for Iraq; however,&#13;
Iraq has been defined as one of the "high risk-weak control environment countries" that requires&#13;
special attention, from the Bank,at various levels. Major reasons for this categorization are the impact of&#13;
the security conditions and years of isolation, the weaknesses of the public FM system, the inefficiencies&#13;
of the banking system, the very low ranking in the Corruption Perception Index for 2005, and the various&#13;
reports issued by independent auditors and other donors, including the International Monetary Fund-&#13;

MOEn -FMArrangements Backgrounds&#13;
&#13;
MOEn exists in 14 governorates, in addition to Baghdad. The MOEn follows the central accounting&#13;
system that is financedthrough budget allocationsfrom MOF. There is a Directorate General of Finance&#13;
and Administration(DG) and an Internal ControlDepartmentwithinthe MOEn. The Finance Unit within&#13;
the DG has: Budget, Accounting, Expenditures, Revenues, Public Debt and Monitoring sections. The&#13;
Internal Control Department is responsible for ex-ante and post audit of expenditures, performance of&#13;
periodical banking and advances reconciliations, periodical stock-taking, and review of reports before&#13;
submission to MOF. A combination of the Financial and Internal Control verification ensures the&#13;
regularity of payments, compliance with the applicable rules, allocation within the budget, and existence&#13;
of proper signature before disbursement or replenishment of advances. The Inspector General has an&#13;
active role in MOEn in establishingan independent system responsible for execution, adaptation of riles&#13;
deterringfinancialfraud and corruption.MOEn has one Iraqi Dinars current account in RafidainBank.&#13;

Budgeting:The PMT willmaintain a project budget and detailed disbursementplan per quarter. This plan&#13;
was developed based on the initial procurement plan and estimated payments cycles, and will be revised&#13;
upon need. It will be used as a monitoringtool to analyze budget variances and manage cash.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Accounting: Based on the number of the contracts the frequency of payments, spreadsheet applications&#13;
will be used to record the project's financialtransactions and generate reports. Procedures for protecting&#13;
the data and preventing losses will be maintained.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Reporting:The PMT will be responsible for preparing the following:&#13;
    o Quarterly Interim financial reports/Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and submitting them&#13;
        with the quarterly progress reports to the Bank within 45 days from the quarter then ended. The&#13;
        format of the reports was agreed on and included in the project files. These reports consist of a&#13;
         statement of sources and uses of hnds by component; statement of uses of funds by category of&#13;
         expenditure; both comparing actual and planned expenditures; and list of contracts'&#13;
         commitments.&#13;
    o Annually Project Financial Statements (PFS), and submitting an audited PFS with the&#13;
        independent auditor opinion having to the Bank not later than six months after the end of each&#13;

         statementof uses of funds by category of expenditures; and (iii) list of contracts' commitments.&#13;
&#13;
Auditing Arrangements: An external independent auditor acceptable to the Bank and with international&#13;
experience will be engaged to carry out the project audit in accordance with international standards of&#13;
auditing, issue the required independent opinion, and prepare the management letter. The audit TORS&#13;
include performing an SOE review for the auditperiod covered. The audit report and management letter&#13;
will be submittedby the PMT to the Bank not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. An&#13;
escrow accountwill be used to pay the auditor afterthe project's closing date.&#13;
&#13;
FiduciaryMonitoringAgent      m):     TheBank has engaged an independent firmthat will operatein Iraq&#13;
as FMA for ITF-financed projects. The FMA staff will be granted regular accessto the project documents&#13;
and sites by MOEn. This FMA has dual roles:&#13;
      - Verifying and validatingto the Bankthe projects' financialmanagement and procurement&#13;
         arrangements and internal controls agreedupon with the implementing agencies.&#13;
      - Providing advisory services and technical support to the Iraqi government and the ITF-financed&#13;
         projects relating to the projects' financial management and procurement arrangements and the&#13;
         generation of periodical and reliable financialreports.&#13;

B. Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to implement projects through the Iraqi Ministries (rather than through&#13;
project implementation units outside Government structures), ensuring that appropriate and effective&#13;
financial controls are in place over the use of fundsprovidedby the Bank, while atthe sametime working&#13;
together to strengthen the Ministries' own financial control processes and procedures. Taking into&#13;
consideration the high risk environment assessed for the project, including the assessed high financial&#13;
management risk, the disbursement arrangements will compensate by continuing to use conservative&#13;
disbursementmethods, namely:&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
These are the disbursement methods that have been used in the existing World Bank ITF projects&#13;
currently under implementation and which have proven to be effective. Extensive training will be&#13;
provided to the PMT on the Bank's disbursement procedures. Supporting documentation, e.g., copies of&#13;
invoices and receipts, is required to be provided with all requests to disburse funds. The original copies&#13;
of the supporting documentation will be maintained by MOEn and made available for review by Bank&#13;
representatives upon request.&#13;
&#13;
The agreements with the Donors to the World Bank ITF allow for the financing of 100percent of project&#13;
expenditures. MOEn would contribute implementation support, including the assignment of MOEn staff&#13;
to the PMT and some related operating expenses. The allocation of the proceeds of the Grant by&#13;

A. Air Qualitv&#13;
&#13;
Air quality in many areas of Iraq deteriorated significantlyfollowingthe first Gulf War in 1991with fires&#13;
engulfingpetroleum refineries and &amp;el reservoirs for days together. In addition, the prolonged use of low&#13;
quality fuel in the transport and industrial sectors has adverselyimpactedthe air quality. The situationhas&#13;
been aggravated by the sanctions imposed on the country and the associated shortage in supplies and&#13;
equipments for industrial emission control and vehicle maintenance. Moreover, the government of Iraq&#13;
has not undertaken reforestation activities or taken initiative for maintenanceof green belts.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of air quality monitoring, the MOEn has a very limited number of equipment. The existing&#13;
human capacity for air quality monitoring is inadequate. Existing data on air quality are limited but can&#13;
provide a general view on issues of concern, in general, and the cities of Baghdad, Basra, and Mosul, in&#13;
particular. Moreover, simulation studies conducted using the load of various emissions from fixed and&#13;
mobile sources also provide insight into the current status of air quality.&#13;
&#13;
Effect on Public Health: The poor quality of air has negative impact on public health. High Particulate&#13;
Matter (PM) levels results in irritation or damage to lungs and increases surf$ce area for adsorbing&#13;
chemicalpollutants. Also, materials made of stone and concrete suffer discoloration, metals are tarnished&#13;
and ceramic and glasses are eroded. High levels of lead interfere with normal red blood cell formation,&#13;
affects cell metabolism, and affects fetuses and small children delayingmental and physical development.&#13;
Nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide causes mucous membrane irritation and respiratory infection,&#13;
including problems such as emphysema and broncho-constrictions. These also contribute to acid rain&#13;
formation, erosion of materials, corrosion, etc. These impacts are associated with considerable economic&#13;
costto the society, although costs arehard to quantify.&#13;
&#13;
Measurement of air quality will enable MOEn to assess the deterioration currently occurring and devise&#13;
policy response to arrest the decline. The database will be an important input to policy debates and will&#13;
serve as public evidence supportingthe need for any regulatory policies. As for example, current studies&#13;
indicate that land transport sector possibly contributesto more than 90% of the total emissions, including&#13;
60-75% of PM levels in the cities. Any regulations controlling transportation sector will be unpopular&#13;
unless it is backed by credible evidence and adequate public awarenesscreated over time.&#13;
&#13;
Mobile source emissions: The transport sector presents an important source of emissions in Iraqi cities,&#13;
particularly Baghdad, Basra and Mosul. The absence of an adequate public transport system, the poor&#13;
conditions of the road infrastructure,the lack of pedestrian zones, the high reliance on personal cars, and&#13;
the aged vehicle fleet operating on low quality leaded and diesel fuel with no regular inspection and&#13;
maintenance are all factors contributing to increased emissions from mobile sources. Vehicle-induced&#13;
emissions include Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), Sulfur Dioxide (SOz), Volatile&#13;
Organic Chemicals (VOCs), PM, lead (Pb), and others. Detailed information about the transport sector&#13;
status in the three Iraqi pilot cities, including vehicle fleet size, level of vehicle ownership, fleet&#13;
distribution,fleet age, fuel consumption,etc. is generally lacking or limited at best.&#13;
&#13;
Fixed sources of emissions: Industrial facilities represent the major fixed emission sources in Baghdad,&#13;
Basra, and Mosul. Emitting industries include power stations, petroleum refineries, chemical production,&#13;
brick kilns, smelting of lead and aluminum (including small informal production), textiles, tanneries,&#13;
asphalt production, welding shops, metal working, soils and cleaning products, grainlflour mills, and&#13;
bakery products. Most industries have no emission control measures. In the best of cases, they have&#13;
elevated stacks for emission dispersion.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
An equally important source of emissions in Iraq is the continual bum-off or flaring of excess natural gas&#13;
at oil fields leading to potential high levels of nitrogen oxides and other constituents (sulfur dioxide,&#13;
carbon dioxide, etc.) depending on the quality of the gas flared. Other fixed emission sources include&#13;
construction activities (dust and PM), wastewater treatmentplants [methane (CW) hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#13;
mercaptans, etc.], solid waste handling and disposalfacilities (HZS, CW, mercaptans, ammonia, etc.), and&#13;
improperly operated hospital incinerators.&#13;
&#13;
Air Quality Indicators: In the past two decades, air quality monitoring in Iraq has been limited and&#13;
intermittent, mainly focused on Baghdad, thus constrainingthe abilityto evaluatethe air quality situation&#13;
in the country in a comprehensivemanner. In the 1980s,the Air Quality Section, under the Directorate of&#13;
Environmental Protection and Improvement of the Ministry of Health, monitored air quality in Baghdad&#13;
using four fixed air quality monitoring stations and one mobile air quality laboratory for the various&#13;
districts. High Volume Samplers were also used to collect filter samples for PM analysis as well as&#13;
Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy analysis to trace heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Zn,Mn, Pb, Cr, Cd and Hg).&#13;
Levels of SO2, CO, and NOx were measured using commonly available instruments. At the end of the&#13;
1980s, the measuring equipment became non-operational due to shortage of spare parts and lack of&#13;
technical expertise to maintain them. The High Volume Samplers remained the only operational&#13;
equipment due to their ease of maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
PM, CO and SOz: Between 1998 and 2002, air quality monitoring for CO and SO2 in Baghdad was&#13;
resumed using equipmentprovided by the WHO. Limited equipmentwere installed only attwo locations.&#13;
The program was followed up diligently. After the war in 2003, air quality monitoring was conducted in&#13;
Baghdad by the newly established MOEn using available equipment, including two CO analyzers, two&#13;
SO2analyzers, and five High Volume Samplers (MOEn, 2006). In other governorates, no complete air&#13;
quality monitoring program existed. Measurements were restricted to monthly levels of settling dust.&#13;
Limited data from available monitoring activities are presented in Table 6.1 below and comparedto WHO&#13;
standards.&#13;
&#13;
         Table 6.1. Concentntionof PM, CO, &amp; SO2inBaghdadfortheyears 1998to 2005 (MOEn, 2006)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As seen from the above table, average PM levels are 5 to 16 higher than WHO standards. There is&#13;
substantial research evidencethat PM is the air pollutantthat has shownthe strongesthealth impacts.&#13;
&#13;
Lead Concentration: An unpublished study by the Iraqi MOEn monitored lead concentrations&#13;
intermittently in five health facilities in Baghdad, duringthe years 2000-2001 (Table 6.2). Measurements&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
show wide variations that cannot be reasonably interpreted, particularly in the absence of meteorological&#13;
data. Most values exceedthe 1pglm3 standard set by the WHO.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Finally, a study conducted by Tebodin B.V. (2004) assessed air quality in the cities of Baghdad, Basra&#13;
and Mosul, by using a Decision Support System (DSS), estimatingthe load of various indicators emitted&#13;
by fixed and mobile sources that are expected to affect air quality in these urban areas. The study&#13;
concluded that environmental management of air pollution caused by t r a c in urban areas, should&#13;
become a matter of prime concern in Iraq. While these problems exist in other large cities in the world,&#13;
impacts are somewhat worse in Iraq in comparisonto similar cities in the region because of the state onad&#13;
age of the existing vehicles and the road andthe quality of fuels with relatively elevated levels of leas and&#13;
sulfur.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.Water Quality&#13;
&#13;
Rapidly declining water quality is leading to health issues as well as to rising costs for water supply,&#13;
increased salinization of agricultural lands and to negative impacts on ecosystems. The most urgent&#13;
pollutionproblems can be categorized as being caused by three issues:&#13;
    -    Untreated sewage water is reportedly discharged into rivers at a rate of one million tons a day.&#13;
         Wastewater treatment plants, in serious need of rehabilitation, often treat both domestic and&#13;
         industrial waste. Many treatment plants are only partially operational or not operational at all,&#13;
         releasing raw sewage to rivers.&#13;
    -    Agricultural salinity and thefertilizer industry are major causes for concern. Salinityhas been an&#13;
         issue in Iraq for centuries, but more recently the excessive use of fertilizers has been a major&#13;
         cause of pollution.&#13;
    -    Manufacturing industries, in particular for metal plating and other metal product treatments are&#13;
         causing significantheavy metal and persistentorganic pollutant problems.&#13;
&#13;
According to the Decision Support System for pollution control monitoring7, there are substantial&#13;
amounts of data available on water quality but this is largely fragmented and inconsistent. The&#13;
responsibility for water quality monitoring is shared between MOEn, the Ministry of Water Resources,&#13;
and the Ministry of Municipalities and PublicWorks, without clear demarcation of roles and mandates.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Current World Bank activities in the water sector in Iraq include the preparation of an interim Water&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy and the following projects funded by the ITF: EmergencyWater, Sanitation&#13;
and Urban Reconstruction (P087912), the Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation (P087910)&#13;
and the Emergency Community Infrastructureand Rehabilitation Project (P087881).The Bank is also in&#13;
the process of preparing two IDA projects on water: the Second EmergencyWater Supply and Sanitation&#13;
(P094650)and SecondEmergencyBaghdadWater Supply and Sanitation (P094649).&#13;
&#13;
In addition, donors are becoming increasingly active in the water sector. USAID is funding an all-&#13;
comprehensive water master plan, 'Strategic Visionfor Management of Iraq 's Water Resources '. WHO&#13;
recently purchased water quality control laboratories to MOEn and the Ministry of Municipalities and&#13;
PublicWorks. Over 400 laboratorytechnicians fiom both Ministries were trained in water quality control&#13;
techniques. Numerous donors are undertalung infrastructure rehabilitation projects for dnniung water&#13;
supply and sanitation in Baghdad and various governorates (e.g., USAID, DFID); for capacity building&#13;
for water institutions (UNESCO); for a water training centre in Basra (DFID); for irrigationwater supply,&#13;
drainage and rehabilitation of pumping stations (FAO). As mentioned in the previous section, UNEP is&#13;
supporting environmental governancethrough assessment and capacity building and is also supporting a&#13;
environmentallysoundtechnologies for the Marshlands - including drinking water and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C. Waste Mana~ement&#13;
&#13;
There are two primary sources of wastes in Baghdad that this project addresses - the Municipal Waste&#13;
fiom communityand the Healthcare wastes fiom the hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
Municipal Waste&#13;
&#13;
The estimated population of Baghdad is about 5 million. The amount of municipal solid waste (MSW)&#13;
reaching the dump sites is about 8,000 m3*per day in Baghdad. This amount does not includethe waste&#13;
in some sectors which cannot be reached because of the security situation. Prior to the conflicts, Iraq's&#13;
main cities had efficient collection systems, transfer stations, and basic landfills for final disposal on the&#13;
perimeter of the cities. However, sincethe conflicts and UN sanctions, waste collection and disposal have&#13;
been significantlyreduced. More than two-thirds of the domestic wastes arenot being collected and safely&#13;
disposed. Waste is only collected fiom wealthy residential areas and governmentalbuildings (as high as&#13;
once per dayto once every 1-2weeks, depending onthe securitysituation),with the remaining population&#13;
carrying waste by hand to informal dump sites withinthe city. Rural communities dispose and bum their&#13;
wastes in deserted areas or village dumps&#13;
&#13;
The current services for the collectionand disposal of municipal waste in Baghdad are characterized by:&#13;
    -   Lack of appropriate policies, institutional and legal framework for the whole chain of municipal&#13;
        waste management services;&#13;
    -   Absence or weakly functioning systems for the collection, transfer, treatment and disposal of all&#13;
        types of wastes, including municipal, hazardous and non-hazardous healthcare and industrial&#13;
        wastes;&#13;
    -   Risks to human health from accumulations of municipal, industrial, demolition and healthcare&#13;
        wastes in residential areas;&#13;
    -   Health and environmentalrisks from uncontrolled dump sites;&#13;
    -   Lack of environmentalstandards; and&#13;
    -   Lack of capacities and resources to operatethe sites in a controlled manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Mayoralityof Baghdad Survey&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The existing disposal sites servingBaghdad are as follow:&#13;
    -   A USAID-funded, newly constructed, 20-acre, 70% completed sanitary landfill in Al-Buatha&#13;
        (Dora quarter), which is not used yet because of security concerns, as well as lack of capacity to&#13;
        operate it;&#13;
    -   Al-Amari dump site which consists of four different uncontrolled dump sites: old el Amari and&#13;
        Al-Baweya (which are no longer in use) and two sites facing each other near the Baghdad&#13;
        thermo-stoneproduction factory. The majority of wastes fromBaghdad reachthetwo sites nearby&#13;
        the thermo-stone factory sincethey arethe closest (10 Krn) fromthe city of Baghdad.&#13;
    -   Al-Haswa dump site in Abu-Ghreib quarter, which receives small quantities of waste due to the&#13;
        unsecuredroute to the site. The waste amount is 500,000 cubic meter&#13;
    -   Al-Arkeia and Fadei aumping site in Al-Taji quarter, which used to be a quarry site.&#13;
    -   Al Sabiyat dumping site in the Al-Taji quarter which were used before as transfer stationslsites&#13;
&#13;
The proposed project will study the rehabilitationand or closure of the two priority dumping sites of old&#13;
el Arnari and a1Sabiyat.&#13;
&#13;
Healthcare Waste&#13;
&#13;
In Baghdad, there are 41 government hospitals containing about 11,200 beds and producing health care&#13;
waste of about 3,800 t/year. There is limited information available on the characteristics, composition,&#13;
quantities, methods and technologies for segregation, collection and disposal of hazardous and non-&#13;
hazardous healthcare wastes (HCW). It has been reported that HCW is either co-disposed with MSW in&#13;
uncontrolled dump sites, or burnt in crude incinerators, causing significant health and environmental&#13;
concerns. This is mainly due to the lack of capacities and systems in medical establishmentsin managing&#13;
HCW, the limited availability of poorly operated treatment facilities on site, as well as the non-existence&#13;
of off-siteHCW management systems in collection, and final treatment and disposal of HCW&#13;
&#13;
In particular,the Baghdad Medical ComplexCenter (BMCC) isthe largestmedical center in the city, with&#13;
2,500 beds. It consists of 12 medical institutions which include six hospitals, one central laboratory, a&#13;
cardiology, blood-bank, radiation and dentistry centers. The proposed project aims at preparing an&#13;
assessment and action plan to improve health care waste management in the BMCC and Al-Yarmouk&#13;
Hospital and stimulate future investment. This will be jointly coordinated with the Ministry of the&#13;
Environment and the Ministry of Health.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of Emergency Environment
            Management Project in Iraq is to strengthen key
            institutional and regulatory functions of the Ministry of
            Environment (MOEn). These key institutional and regulatory
            functions will enable MOEn to undertake environmental policy
            analysis and coordination, formulate laws and regulations,
            monitor environmental quality, promote environmental
            awareness and conduct technical studies. The project will
            have four components: (1) strengthen the environmental
            management capacity of MOEn which will focus on four key
            environmental functions of MOEn: (a) policy formulation
            through the preparation of an environmental action plan for
            Iraq; (b) strengthening the regulatory function of MOEn; (c)
            strengthening the monitoring and enforcement capacity of
            MOEn; and (d) raising environmental awareness among school
            children; (2) develop capacity in environmental monitoring
            to focus on installing air quality monitoring network in 3
            cities and assisting in improving coordination, collection
            and disclosure of data on water quality; (3) strengthen
            technical capacity in waste management; and (4) establish a
            project management team to be responsible for managing,
            coordinating and monitoring all components of the project.
