EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This report is the result of an international effort led by the Responsible Aquaculture Foundation of the Global Aquaculture Alliance and the&#13;
World Bank to bring together, synthesize, analyze and draw practical lessons from the experience of major aquaculture disease outbreaks&#13;
in Chile, Vietnam, Madagascar, and Mozambique for the benefit of stakeholders throughout the aquaculture industry. It was produced by a&#13;
broad spectrum of experts and engaged a wide range of industry, government, and civil society informants.&#13;
&#13;
The objective was not to compare how the case study countries found themselves with disease problems and then scrutinize their success&#13;
in coping, but rather look for commonalities and exceptions in the history and structure of aquaculture in three regions of the world to&#13;
elucidate key concepts in aquatic disease management and inform farmers, investors, and policy makers on how to prepare themselves for&#13;
the inevitable.&#13;

CHILE&#13;
The Chilean salmon farming industry is in the process of recovering from a serious outbreak of infectious salmon anemia (ISA) which began&#13;
in 2007. This outbreak caused severe impacts on Atlantic salmon production which formerly represented two-thirds of Chilean salmonid&#13;
output. It also had important secondary impacts on employment, social welfare, and international market presence.&#13;
&#13;
For almost three decades Chile transferred, adapted, and developed technologies, products, and markets to become the second largest&#13;
producer of farmed salmon in the world, with over 500 active farming sites, creating value for the entire country and for the regions where&#13;
the industry operates. However, this impressive technical and commercial success was not accompanied by matching research, monitoring,&#13;
and regulation to guard against foreseeable biological risks. This imbalance impaired the industryâ&#128;&#153;s ability to avert and control the outbreak&#13;
of ISA in 2007.&#13;
&#13;
Productive, economic, and social impacts of the outbreak were magnified due to the industryâ&#128;&#153;s size and the rapid spread of the pathogen,&#13;
facilitated by a high concentration of farms in some areas, poor husbandry, and weak biosecurity.&#13;
&#13;
A rapid and well-coordinated public-private effort ensured that basic infectious disease control measures were implemented and enforced&#13;
as an immediate response. In parallel, longer-term efforts involving the government, the industry, and the financial sector allowed compa-&#13;
nies to continue operating while new laws and regulations laid the foundations for the industryâ&#128;&#153;s renewal.&#13;
&#13;
In spite of the new regulations and practices, there are still important issues to address including the need for:&#13;
&#13;
    Â&#131;Â&#131; mechanisms to ensure that overconcentration of farming activity in certain areas is avoided,&#13;
    Â&#131;Â&#131; boundary definition of production zones,&#13;
    Â&#131;Â&#131; definition of zone carrying capacities,&#13;
    Â&#131;Â&#131; surveillance programs to detect and/or predict new environmental and disease issues before they can affect the industry.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Overall lessons emphasize that aquaculture depends on the capacity of biological systems to support it and that defining the aquaculture&#13;
      carrying capacities of bodies of water is essential in order to set limits on the maximum production in farming areas. Unless this is done,&#13;
      conditions will deteriorate leading to poor fish performance and eventually to disease. Also, when bodies of water are shared, regulations&#13;
      are required to ensure that all parties involved are good stewards of the environment and the larger the industry is the greater the risks and&#13;
      the harder it is to control a problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      VIETNAM&#13;
      Growing out of the transformation of over 2 million hectares of rice paddy affected by saline intrusion, Vietnamese shrimp farming, 88 per-&#13;
      cent of which takes place in the Mekong Delta, is characterized by sprawl. Some 243 thousand, 96 percent small-scale, shrimp farms cover&#13;
      nearly 600,000 ha of the Mekong Delta. Overall, these low-intensity farms represent 90 percent of the shrimp farming area of Vietnam, but&#13;
      account for only 62 percent of produce, the 10 percent of farms that employ more intensive technology producing the balance.&#13;
&#13;
      Low-intensity ponds maintain water quality by constantly flowing canal water through their ponds. Being open to the water supply system,&#13;
      all of the farms along any particular canal are effectively sharing and managing the same water. Any disease that affects one farm rapidly&#13;
      affects all of the others downstream. This, along with the lack of any mechanism for coordinating farmer information sharing and response&#13;
      to crisis, and haphazard transfer of brood and seedstock, has made the shrimp industry of southern Vietnam vulnerable to a wide range of&#13;
      diseases that have repeatedly infected the area.&#13;
&#13;
      Beginning in about 2009, a new disease, early mortality syndrome or EMS (aka: acute hepatopancreas necrosis syndrome, AHPNS) began to&#13;
      cause significant production losses in southern China. By 2010 the range of affected farms in China had expanded, and by 2011 EMS was&#13;
      confirmed in Vietnam and Malaysia, with some areas losing as much as 90 percent of their shrimp crop. EMS reached Thailand in 2012. The&#13;
      collateral damage to employment, social welfare, and international market presence caused by EMS/AHPNS is estimated in the billions of&#13;
      US dollars.&#13;
&#13;
      Lacking any coordinated system for sharing information with other farmers or the government, the ability of the industry to respond to&#13;
      crisis was limited. Rumors of what caused the disease were rampant, and millions of dollars were wasted on mistaken causes and remedies.&#13;
&#13;
      Initially, environmental toxins, particularly pesticides, were suspected as the cause of EMS/AHPNS. Only through a well-coordinated local&#13;
      and international research and farmer outreach effort based on modern technology was the source of EMS/AHPNS resolved. The disease&#13;
      is now known to be caused by a unique strain of a relatively common bacterium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which may be infected with a&#13;
      phage, a virus-like particle that inserts itself into and modifies normally harmless Vibrio DNA to produce highly toxic gene products that kill&#13;
      young shrimp.&#13;
&#13;
      While still ongoing, the experience of the shrimp farming sector in struggling against EMS/AHPNS in Vietnam represents a valuable case&#13;
      study for other sectors of global aquaculture, particularly those experiencing rapidly emerging production with lagging regulations, weak&#13;
      veterinary services, and a dispersed and generally small-scale farming community. It highlights the importance of collective action among&#13;
      and between farmers, government regulators and researchers, and the open sharing of information in identifying the causes and, thus the&#13;
      possible remedies, of aquatic animal diseases.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
      MADAGASCAR/MOZAMBIQUE&#13;
      The shrimp farming industry along the Mozambique Channel is comprised of less than a dozen relatively large-scale farms, widely spaced&#13;
      and coordinated through strong national shrimp producer associations. The main production system is of high-value Penaeus monodon&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          R E D U C I N G D I S E A S E R I S K I N A Q UA C U LT U R E&#13;
&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                                                                                                  xv&#13;

destined for high-end European markets. Production systems are relatively extensive, with large amounts of water exchanged to maintain&#13;
good growth rates. The isolation of these farms far from the main shrimp growing areas in Southeast Asia led regulators to believe that they&#13;
could ignore the dangers of disease posed by an open water supply.&#13;
&#13;
White spot disease (WSD) is a contagious viral disease of penaeid shrimp and is caused by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The&#13;
shrimp industries in Mozambique, and Madagascar remained free from WSD until September 2011, when a shrimp farm in Quelimane,&#13;
Mozambique, experienced an outbreak. Since then, the industry in Mozambique has virtually shut down. Eight months later, there was an&#13;
outbreak of WSD in Madagascar at a farm north of Morondava, which is still out of service. Another infected Malagasy shrimp farm has been&#13;
extensively modified with upgraded filtration and disinfection systems and now seems to be operating well, while a third has experienced&#13;
another outbreak and is currently being upgraded. The disease is believed to have come via ballast water from previously infected areas&#13;
along the Arabian Peninsula.&#13;
&#13;
Recovery from the WSSV crisis will require several changes at the farm level, the single most important of which is to eliminate the use of wild&#13;
broodstock. This will require the establishment of breeding programs to develop Specific pathogen-free (SPF) broodstock. As a long-term&#13;
strategy, SPF broodstock should be selected for resistance to WSSV. This is a time-consuming and expensive process that may be beyond the&#13;
means of individual farms. Needed is a regional breeding center to produce SPF broodstock that are genetically selected for resistance to WSSV.&#13;
&#13;
The second most important change that farms can make is to reduce or eliminate their dependence on water exchange. The most effective&#13;
way of accomplishing this is to install aeration systems in the ponds. Biosecurity on shrimp farms can also be improved by avoiding stock-&#13;
ing during the winter months, filtering incoming seawater using screens of 200 microns or less, chlorinating ponds after initial filling, and&#13;
installing crab fences and bird netting.&#13;
&#13;
At the national level the regulatory framework needs to be upgraded to include a comprehensive aquatic animal health (AAH) policy, an&#13;
adequately funded regulatory agency and a national reference laboratory. National AAH plans should be developed to clearly identify the&#13;
role of each stakeholder in a national biosecurity program and the strategies for responding to disease outbreaks. Disease surveillance pro-&#13;
grams consistent with OIE standards should be set up and funded nationally. There is a strong need for capacity building in the public sector&#13;
with respect to aquatic animal health management. Priority should be given to promoting collaboration between the producer associations&#13;
and the government ministries in the development of national biosecurity policies and programs.&#13;
&#13;
As problems affecting one side of the Mozambique will inevitably affect the other side as well, the national AAH plans of Mozambique and&#13;
Madagascar should be integrated to form a regional AAH plan. Regular meetings between stakeholder groups of both countries should be&#13;
scheduled to allow for the sharing of information and the discussion of cooperative projects, such as the development of a regional breed-&#13;
ing center and the sharing of surveillance data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
COST-BENEFIT OF BIOSECURITY&#13;
Losses to the aquaculture industry globally are estimated by FAO at about US$6 billion annually. The ISA outbreak in the Chilean salmon&#13;
farming industry cost US$2 billion dollars and 20,000 jobs. The EMS outbreak in the Mekong Delta is costing what are mostly small-scale&#13;
producers about US$800 million per year that they cannot afford, and this does not include the unknown number of jobs lost in the rest of&#13;
the shrimp value chain. Losses from WSSV outbreaks in Asia were estimated at US$6 billion during outbreaks in 1992â&#128;&#147;93 and US$1â&#128;&#147;2 billion&#13;
during 1999 outbreaks in Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
Diseases are ubiquitous and pretending outbreaks will not happen because they have not happened is not rational. Suiss-RE, a major&#13;
agricultural crop insurer, calculates that the average insurance loss ratio for aquaculture over the period 1992â&#128;&#147;2012 was 65 percent and&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;xvi                                                                                                                                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      disease accounted for 20 percent of that (in the relatively well-managed salmon farming industry). Most aquaculture disease outbreaks have&#13;
      occurred in developing countries where over 90 percent of aquaculture takes place, reducing revenues, eliminating jobs, threatening food&#13;
      security, and undermining development goals. The generally small-scale and rural nature of aquaculture in developing countries means that&#13;
      the vast majority of diseases go undiagnosed, untreated, and undocumented, imposing an enormous burden on communities working to&#13;
      escape poverty.&#13;
&#13;
      Required investments in biosecurity to minimize the risk of disease outbreaks will vary according to place and scale. The need for improved&#13;
      diagnostic and surveillance capacity of national veterinary services is one common element among all case studies. The establishment of a&#13;
      national and/or regional platform for communication between government and farmers is also important, but less costly. Apart from these&#13;
      governmental investments, in Chile, major costs for salvaging the salmon industry were associated with relocation and restocking of farm&#13;
      installations, costs borne mostly by the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
      In Vietnam (and Southeast Asia more generally), the farm-level investment needed to manage EMS is not yet known, but government investment&#13;
      in affordable three-phase electricity would help lift constraints to the ability of lower income farmers to reduce their dependence on high levels&#13;
      of water exchange. Providing assistance to establish a forum for communication and cooperation among the hundreds of thousands of farmers&#13;
      that share a contiguous water supply will also improve monitoring of, and compliance with, farm-level and regional biosecurity protocols.&#13;
&#13;
      Along the Mozambique Channel, farm-level improvements in biosecurity have been estimated at between US$6 and 14 million, depending&#13;
      upon the level of security. A basic system includes stocking SPF shrimp postlarvae (PLs), crab fencing, bird netting, probiotic usage, and&#13;
      structures to allow drainage of seawater distribution canals. Reducing stocking rate to allow reduced water exchange is probably unprofit-&#13;
      able. The addition of aeration plus bag filtration increases productivity, reduces overall operating costs, and improves the profit margin.&#13;
      Net returns per kg of shrimp produced are estimated at US$1.25/kg with no biosecurity plan and US$2.00/kg under this strategy. The most&#13;
      biosecure strategy, in which aeration and microscreen drum filtration is used, is very capital intensive with an expected investment cost of&#13;
      about US$14 million for a 400 ha-farm. Despite the high cost, the profit per kg of shrimp is reduced by only US$0.12/kg.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
      From review of case study findings, it is clear that there are several key structural and behavioral attributes of the aquaculture industry that&#13;
      make it vulnerable to disease. First and foremost is that disease management transcends the boundaries of individual farms. Area manage-&#13;
      ment systems are essential. It is also clear that, while the species, production systems, participants, and institutions involved in the operation&#13;
      and regulation of aquaculture vary from place to place, the science and logic that can reduce the incidence and severity of disease are&#13;
      common throughout the industry.&#13;
&#13;
      Conditions that lead to disease include: (1) close proximity among farming operations and/or shared water supply and discharge; (2) unreg-&#13;
      ulated transfer of animals and/or gametes among farms and from sites outside of the farming area; (3) lack of adherence to on-farm sanitary&#13;
      protocols; (4) inadequate diagnostic and veterinary services; and (5) failure of farmers to share information and cooperate in collective action&#13;
      to respect best management practices and respond to crises.&#13;
&#13;
      Corrective measures to avoid or moderate diseases in aquaculture respond directly to the causative conditions: (1) regulate the density of&#13;
      farms within a designated zone so as to avoid sharing of water inputs and outfalls; (2) quarantine and carefully control movement of culture&#13;
      animals into the zone and between farms once introduced; (3) adoption of best aquaculture practices at farm level to reduce stress and&#13;
      improve animal welfare; (4) strengthen veterinary services to provide basic diagnostics and guidance to farmers; and (5) structure dialogue&#13;
      among farmers and between government and farmers to improve knowledge and compliance, while reducing free ridership.&#13;

&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                                                                                               x v ii&#13;

&#13;
As a first step in addressing constraints to aquaculture disease management, a review of the existing aquatic veterinary services is recom-&#13;
mended. The OIE conducts standardized reviews of veterinary services that can identify opportunities to improve performance and capacity,&#13;
and collect data for cost-benefit analysis of investments in improved biosecurity.&#13;
&#13;
As disease is not simply a matter of the presence or absence of pathogens, veterinary services to aquaculture need to move beyond the&#13;
laboratory to explore the host-agent-environmental triad that creates the necessary conditions for disease and can illuminate management&#13;
planning.&#13;
&#13;
Knowing the carrying capacity of the ecosystems of which aquaculture is a part is crucial to scaling of the industry that operates within it.&#13;
Data and analysis are required at the local level to adapt general carrying capacity models to local conditions and the preferences of local&#13;
communities.&#13;
&#13;
Estimation of the carrying capacity of the watershed or water body in which aquaculture is being conducted requires spatial mapping of&#13;
production systems and their related hydrology. As the single greatest constraint to proper disease management in aquaculture is the lack&#13;
of cohesion and cooperation among producers, encouraging management planning at the ecosystem, rather than farm, level serves not&#13;
only to define the space over which biosecurity rules should be implemented, but creates a context in which farmers may be better able to&#13;
understand the need for collective action.&#13;
&#13;
The primary lesson of these case studies is that aquaculture disease management goes beyond the limits of individual farms and requires a&#13;
collective zone management approach. The salmon industry has, sometimes painfully, learned this lesson and is now raising itself to a new,&#13;
more sustainable, level in Chile and elsewhere. Globally, shrimp farmers and other aquaculture producers who share a waterbody with their&#13;
neighbors, need to reflect on the examples of Chile, Vietnam, Mozambique, and Madagascar and take steps to improve coordination among&#13;
farmers and between the farming community and regulators so as to better manage the ecosystems in which they operate. Only through&#13;
an ecosystem approach can the industry reduce volatility, improve profitability, and approach greater sustainability.&#13;

Extensive farms typically use simple technologies, have relatively                                     adjacent to a water source which in the Mekong Delta area is usually&#13;
low production rates per crop, and may use little or no supplemen-                                     a canal (figure 3.3).&#13;

accounts for 2 percent of culture area and is responsible for 4 per-&#13;
cent of production.&#13;
&#13;
The third type of shrimp farm management is done with the use&#13;
of intensive shrimp culture technology. Such ponds are generally&#13;
smaller than extensive or semi-intensive ponds, are fed multiple&#13;
times per day, average about 0.5 ha in surface area, and have from 2&#13;
to 6 or more horsepower of mechanical aeration per pond. Intensive&#13;
systems stock 20â&#128;&#147;40 PL/m2 and harvest 2.5â&#128;&#147;6 tons/ha. This system&#13;
occupies 8 percent of the total culture area but accounts for 34 per-&#13;

the other two strategies is aeration. Strategy #1 assumes no aera-                                     not stocked during the winter months. In the summer, the ponds&#13;

The costs and returns for each of the four scenarios are presented&#13;

    Â&#131;Â&#131; Reducing stocking densities to allow for lower water ex-&#13;
         change rates is not a viable biosecurity strategy. The gains in&#13;
         biosecurity are minimal and the reduced productivity of the&#13;
         farm may very well make the farm unprofitable.&#13;
    Â&#131;Â&#131; The addition of 5 hp/ha of aeration should allow for a signifi-&#13;
         cant increase in productivity from 1.57 MT/ha/crop to&#13;
         2.36 MT/ha/crop, while minimizing the need for water exchange.&#13;
    Â&#131;Â&#131; Biosecurity Strategy #2 (aeration plus bag filtration) increases&#13;
         productivity, reduces overall operating costs, and improves&#13;
         the profit margin. Net returns per kg of shrimp produced&#13;
         are estimated at US$1.25/kg with no biosecurity plan and&#13;
         US$2.00/kg under Strategy #2.&#13;

     As many of these activities require considerable planning and finan-                      distinct from WSSV found elsewhere in the world. This strongly sug-&#13;

     Key implementation activities include: 1) integration into national                       Channel strains of WSSV. The WSSV outbreak in Saudi Arabia began&#13;
     plans and other subregional or regional programs and, 2) focal                            in January, 2011, 9 months before the outbreak in Mozambique. It&#13;
     points or national coordinators on aquatic animal health supported                        seems likely that the WSSV in the Mozambique Channel originated&#13;

            Reducing disease risk in aquaculture
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            There are thousands of rickettsial,
            viral, bacterial, protozoan, and metazoan parasites that
            cause disease in farmed aquatic animals. While the basics of
            farm-level disease management are known, the
            interconnectedness among aquaculture installations and
            between aquaculture and the external environment means that
            only a few careless farms can ruin an industry. Considering
            the gravity and frequency of fish disease outbreaks,
            guidelines on the development and implementation of national
            policies for their prevention, detection, and management are
            urgently needed. Hampering this is the lack of a
            comprehensive overview of the practical ways and means of
            regulating aquaculture that will permit both governments and
            aqua culturists to: (1) calculate the cost-benefit ratio of
            investments in disease control, and (2) find a
            cost-effective strategy for the implementation of best
            practices. The study is based on review of published and
            unpublished data supplied by the Chilean, Vietnamese,
            Malagasy, and Mozambican authorities, researchers, and local
            aquaculture investors and other stakeholders. The selection
            of case studies was guided by the need to explore disease
            outbreaks in a range of geographical and industrial
            development scenarios. The three case studies capture the
            breadth and depth of experience among farmers and
            governments confronted with catastrophic disease outbreaks
            in aquaculture. The overarching lesson is that successful
            aquaculture depends on the capacity of biological systems to
            support it. Defining the capacities of bodies of water is
            essential in order to regulate the number of farms and to
            set limits on the maximum production in farming areas.
