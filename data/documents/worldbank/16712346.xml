This Training Manual is based on a training curriculum developed by&#13;
Mr. Kamal Kar, initiator of community-driven total sanitation in rural areas.&#13;
This curriculum has been through extensive field testing and our sincere&#13;
thanks to all members of village communities, who contributed generously&#13;
with their time and effort to participate in discussions and PRA exercises.&#13;
In addition, both the curriculum and guidance notes have been refined&#13;
based on a series of policy discussions, workshops and interactions with&#13;
national, state and local governments and expert practitioners in South&#13;
Asia. The Training Manual was developed and written through&#13;
collaboration with WSPâ&#128;&#153;s partner resource agencies, Knowledge Links and&#13;
Feedback Ventures. The publication of this Manual was supported by&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
PRETRAINING PREPARATIONS&#13;
1. About the Training Program&#13;
1.1 Rationale&#13;
Traditionally, rural sanitation programs in India adopted a supply-driven approach that focused on toilet&#13;
construction rather than motivating toilet usage. By contrast, the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) of&#13;
the Government of India (GoI), advocates a community-driven and demand-led approach to rural&#13;
sanitation. Scaling up such an approach requires effective facilitation skills, which are lacking in&#13;
departments more familiar with traditional supply-driven programs. Subsequently, there exists a&#13;
capacity gap for implementing rural sanitation programs based on reform principles. The Training&#13;
Program described in this Manual aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step curriculum for&#13;
imparting essential facilitation skills required to scale up community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
1.2 Objectives&#13;
The overall objective of this training is to build the capacity of potential master trainers to facilitate the&#13;
implementation of the TSC using community-driven total sanitation. The specific objectives of this&#13;
program are to enable participants to:&#13;
â&#150;   Understand the principles and practices of community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
â&#150;   Acquire skills to design and deliver a training program on community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
â&#150;   Support districts/blocks in accelerating achievement of TSC objectives using&#13;
   community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
1.3 Expected Outcomes&#13;
This training program is expected to lead to the following outcomes:&#13;
â&#150;   Participants are able to distinguish between traditional and community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
â&#150;   A pool of resource persons is created at strategic locations within a district, equipped with the skills&#13;
   and capacity to train field motivators on community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
â&#150;   A District-level Action Plan is formulated detailing the concrete steps that master trainers will take&#13;
   after the program to apply the skills and knowledge they have gained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Prerequisites for the Training Program&#13;
Careful preparation prior to the program helps to build the confidence of the facilitator and ensure that&#13;
participants have the most productive learning experience.&#13;
&#13;
2.1 Selection of Participants&#13;
The quality of participants is key to success of the training program. The process for selection of&#13;
participants is as follows:&#13;
â&#150;   Districts, which are implementing TSC, are sensitized on the need and role of resource persons for&#13;
   scaling up community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
â&#150;   Districts agree to the criteria for selection of participants â&#128;&#147; see checklist in Attachment 1 â&#128;&#147; and&#13;
   nominate an appropriate person to attend the training program.&#13;
&#13;
2.2 Developing an Agenda for Training&#13;
This module is divided into 10 sessions spread over five days and the approximate time required is&#13;
given in the session and unit plans. A suggested agenda is in Attachment 2 and trainers may use this&#13;
as a basis for developing an agenda that fits the needs of the training.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.3 Preparing for Individual Sessions&#13;
Each session is divided into units. Instructions on how to facilitate each unit are provided under the&#13;
following headings:&#13;
â&#150;    Objective.&#13;
â&#150;    Time.&#13;
â&#150;    Method.&#13;
â&#150;    Materials.&#13;
â&#150;    Process.&#13;
â&#150;    Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes.&#13;
â&#150;    Learning Outcome.&#13;
&#13;
It must be emphasized that these instructions are intended as guidance only. Facilitators are&#13;
encouraged to be flexible and modify the unit as per the energy levels and enthusiasm of&#13;
the participants.&#13;
&#13;
2.4 Preparing for Field-level Training&#13;
At least four to five villages should be selected for fieldwork, depending on the number of groups&#13;
formed during the workshop. The following checklist will help you to prepare for the field-level training:&#13;
&#13;
Checklist: Preparing for Field-level Training&#13;
&#13;
      1. Selection of villages&#13;
         â&#150;   Are the selected villages located not very far from the training venue?&#13;
         â&#150;   Are the selected villages of average size so that maximum number of community members&#13;
            can be involved?&#13;
         â&#150;   Will the Sarpanch and village-level functionaries be available to participate in discussions&#13;
            on the proposed dates of the field-level training?&#13;
&#13;
      2. The host community&#13;
         â&#150;  Does the community know you are coming and why?&#13;
         â&#150;  Are the field-level training dates and timing convenient for the host community?&#13;
&#13;
      3. Brief village profile obtained for each village selected for field study&#13;
         This should include information on population, socioeconomic status, sanitation status&#13;
         (including usage of toilets), local customs and cultural practices, issues unique to the area&#13;
         (e.g., water scarcity, hard rock or high groundwater table)&#13;
&#13;
      4. Logistics&#13;
      a. Food and beverages&#13;
          â&#150;  Will trainees be eating at the workshop venue or carrying a packed lunch?&#13;
          â&#150;  In case of packed lunch, have you ensured that the pack contains dry food items which are&#13;
            easy to eat on the move?&#13;
          â&#150;  Have arrangements been made for drinking water for trainees during the field-level training?&#13;
&#13;
      b. Transport&#13;
          â&#150;  How will trainees get to the selected villages?&#13;
          â&#150;  Are their sufficient vehicles/drivers/petrol allocations?&#13;
&#13;
      c. Materials&#13;
         â&#150;   Have you prepared a field kit for each team with adequate supply of charts, markers,&#13;
            colored powders and H2S testing kits?&#13;
         â&#150;   Do you have notebooks and pens for each participant?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.5 Training Venue&#13;
It is desirable that the training venue is at least 20 x 40 ft. and has open space available for mock&#13;
exercises. A trainer may have little control over the physical dimensions or features of the venue, but&#13;
should be aware of how these affect participantsâ&#128;&#153; learning experience. If possible, visit the training&#13;
venue before the program is due to start and check if the room suits the requirements. Some&#13;
questions to ask at the training venue are given below.&#13;
&#13;
Checklist: Training Venue&#13;
&#13;
      â&#150;    Are there any potential sources of distraction?&#13;
      â&#150;    Are there enough power points to set up your electrical equipment?&#13;
      â&#150;    Will other people pass through the training venue?&#13;
      â&#150;    Are there adequate sanitation facilities for the participants?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.6 Seating Arrangements&#13;
The seating arrangement should be informal and flexible. For this program, a banquet style seating&#13;
arrangement is advisable as this limits disruption when switching from presentations to group work.&#13;
Some questions to ask about seating arrangements are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
Checklist: Seating Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
      â&#150;    Can everyone see the screen or board easily?&#13;
      â&#150;    Can those sitting at the back hear those speaking at the front?&#13;
      â&#150;    How best can the space be used, especially if the room is cramped?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

SESSION 1: SETTING THE STAGE&#13;
Unit 1.1 Registration and Inauguration&#13;
Objectives                Welcome participants and document their names and contact details&#13;
Time                      15â&#128;&#147;20 minutes&#13;
Materials                 Copies of Attachment 1 â&#128;&#147; Sample format for collecting participant details,&#13;

&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Greet participants and request them to fill in their details in the â&#128;&#152;List of Participantsâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
2. Optional: Once everyone has registered, ask participants to join in the singing of a motivational&#13;
   song related to the training topic.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Analyze the â&#128;&#152;List of Participantsâ&#128;&#153; to answer the following questions:&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; What range of experience, background, departments and gender is represented at the training?&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; What prior knowledge would participants have about the subject matter of training?&#13;
â&#150;      If certain participants have already attended training on participatory methodologies or&#13;
      community-driven total sanitation they should be placed in different groups at the time of&#13;
      group formation.&#13;
â&#150;      The motivational song should be kept brief or optional if you are running short on time. Some tips on&#13;
      facilitating this:&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Initially, participants may feel hesitant or shy to join in the singing. Take the lead by singing&#13;
          along and encourage people to join in by clapping to the song.&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Do not provide the lyrics to the song on paper. Instead, the facilitator should take the lead and&#13;
          encourage participants to listen and sing along.&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; The same song should be sung at the start of each day, prior to commencing the workshop program.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
â&#150;      Facilitators made aware of the background and knowledge level of the participants regarding&#13;
      community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
â&#150;      Motivational song sets an informal tone for the course.&#13;

Unit 1.2 Introductions&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Break the ice at the start of the training program&#13;
Time                      40â&#128;&#147;50 minutes&#13;
Method                    Paired interviewing&#13;
Materials                 Paper, pens&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Explain that we will be playing an introduction game to get to know each other better. Say that the&#13;
   objective of the game is to form pairs.&#13;
2. Pairs can be formed in many ways. One way is to give participants a chit with a color/number/place&#13;
   and ask them to find their pair in the group.&#13;
3. Once pairs are formed, ask participants to get to know their partner a little better by asking&#13;
   questions like:&#13;
   a. What is your name?&#13;
   b. Where are you from?&#13;
   c. Name one thing you like and one thing you dislike?&#13;
4. After five minutes of interviewing each other, each pair should take turns to tell the rest of the group&#13;
   about their partner, summarizing the main information.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Try to keep the tone of the session informal so that participants can speak freely.&#13;
â&#150;      Ice breaking should be done according to the choice of participants and time available on hand.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
â&#150;      Relaxes the participants and begins the process of them getting to know each other and&#13;
      the facilitators.&#13;

Unit 1.3 Setting Norms&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Set the ground rules for the training&#13;
Time                      20â&#128;&#147;30 minutes&#13;
Method                    Brainstorming&#13;
Materials                 Flip chart and markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Explain that the objective of the session is to set some ground rules for the training program.&#13;
2. Ask participants to silently reflect on the ground rules that they would like to set for the training&#13;
   sessions. After a few minutes, ask them to call out their ideas, add any others that come to mind&#13;
   during the discussion.&#13;
3. Write the ideas on a flip chart in the order that they are mentioned.&#13;
4. Discuss each proposed rule in turn and ask participants as a group to decide which to adopt and&#13;
   which to reject. This can be done by a show of hands and then drawing a line under the&#13;
   selected idea.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Examples of norms agreed by participants can be:&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Timings of the workshop.&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Use of mobile phones during sessions.&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Tidying up workshop venue.&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Respecting others opinions and creating an open environment for sharing.&#13;
â&#150;      Try to keep the tone of the discussion as relaxed as possible and encourage participants to&#13;
      speak freely.&#13;
â&#150;      Develop norms that are agreeable to everyone.&#13;
â&#150;      The chart with the norms should be displayed at the workshop venue at a place that is visible to&#13;
      all participants.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
â&#150;      Participants and facilitators develop a shared understanding of how to work together by setting&#13;
      mutually agreed rules of conduct.&#13;

Unit 1.4 Group Formation&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Form groups of five to seven people ensuring equal representation of all types of&#13;
                          participants&#13;
Time                      15â&#128;&#147;20 minutes&#13;
Method                    Calling out numbers&#13;
Materials                 Paper, pen&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Groups can be formed in many ways. One quick, easy and transparent way is to suggest to&#13;
   participants to group themselves according to their institutional affiliation or administrative tier.&#13;
2. Next, ask participants from different types of institutions to stand in row. For instance, Panchayati&#13;
   Raj Institutions (PRIs) to stand in the first row, block-level officers to stand in the second row,&#13;
   district-level representatives in third row, and so on.&#13;
3. Now, based on the number of participants, work out how many groups can be formed for the&#13;
   size you want. Ask participants to call out numbers up to the number of groups needed. So, if&#13;
   five groups are needed, it goes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5â&#128;¦ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on until everyone has called&#13;
   out a number.&#13;
4. The oneâ&#128;&#153;s then form one group, the twoâ&#128;&#153;s another, and so on.&#13;
5. Ask each group to come up with its own name and note it on a piece of paper.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Do the basic sums for group size before starting the counting!&#13;
â&#150;      Labels relevant to the local context can be used instead of numbers, e.g., names of streets or&#13;
      landmarks or fruits, and so on.&#13;
â&#150;      The total number of groups to be formed will depend on the total number of participants, but try to&#13;
      limit group size to five to seven members.&#13;
â&#150;      Ensure heterogeneity of groups in terms of representation from all institutions as well as&#13;
      gender balance.&#13;
â&#150;      If more than one participant has extensive prior knowledge of the subject matter of the training,&#13;
      these individuals should be allocated to different groups.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
â&#150;      Forming heterogeneous groups encourages participants to work together as a team, instead of&#13;
      working according to mandates of the institutions or backgrounds that they come from.&#13;

Unit 1.5 Learning about Expectations and&#13;
Workshop Objectives&#13;
&#13;
Objectives            Learn about participantsâ&#128;&#153; expectations from the course and how these fit with&#13;
                      training objectives&#13;
Time                  30â&#128;&#147;40 minutes&#13;
Method                Discussion in small groups&#13;
Materials             Chart papers, paper cards, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Begin by saying: when you arrived at the training venue, you must have had some expectations&#13;
   from this training program. It is these expectations that we will discuss now.&#13;
2. Give each participant a few paper cards and request them to write their expectations from the&#13;
   workshop. Tell participants that each card can contain only one expectation, and it should be written&#13;
   in a short sentence of seven to eight words in large size.&#13;
   A participant can use as many cards as desired, and each participant should contribute at least&#13;
   one expectation.&#13;
3. After participants have filled in their cards, bring all the cards with expectations to the centre of the&#13;
   room and request participants to stand in a circle, such that they can all see the cards. Tell&#13;
   participants that we are going to categorize expectations by dominant theme.&#13;
4. Go through the cards one by one with the participants, reading out each expectation to the group,&#13;
   analyze the meaning, sort by dominant theme, discuss if it is possible to meet it.&#13;
5. At this stage, share the training program objectives and schedule with participants, and discuss how&#13;
   this addresses their expectations.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;     Classify the cards into four or five themes. Possible themes around which expectations can be&#13;
     raised are: role of trainers, information about TSC/participatory approaches, skills for community&#13;
     mobilization, sanitation technologies, etc.&#13;
â&#150;     Allow the participants to present their expectations in their own language.&#13;
â&#150;     Provide everyone with an opportunity to speak. Individuals trying to dominate a session should be&#13;
     prevented politely. Donâ&#128;&#153;t become the dominator yourself!&#13;
â&#150;     Try to include even those expectations which are not entirely relevant to the training instead of&#13;
     ignoring them.&#13;
â&#150;     Be ready to edit the workshop objectives but without losing the focus of the workshop.&#13;
â&#150;     Politely explain reasons for not considering expectations that are outside the scope of the workshop&#13;
     and park them separately.&#13;
â&#150;     Stick all the cards with the expectations on a big chart and display it at the workshop venue at a&#13;
     place that is visible to all participants.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
â&#150;     Participants reconcile their expectations with course objectives and become familiar with the design&#13;
     of the training program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           This would be a good time to request participants to fill up the Self-assessment Questionnaire&#13;
           (see Attachment 4). This takes about 30 minutes.&#13;

Process&#13;
1. Show participants the film on fecal-oral transmission routes.* Ask them to brainstorm on whether&#13;
   they can think of any transmission routes other than the ones shown in the film. Consolidate all the&#13;
   points on a flip chart.&#13;
2. Ask participants: Now that we know the ways in which feces [use local term] can spread, we need to&#13;
   think about what can be done to stop this from happening. Can you think of any ways to block the&#13;
   spread of diseases through the transmission routes that you have identified?&#13;
3. Encourage participants to brainstorm and call out possible barriers, providing trainer inputs where&#13;
   necessary. Place a picture/card with name of a barrier on the transmission routes diagram, until all&#13;
   the transmission routes are blocked.&#13;
4. Facilitate a discussion on:&#13;
   â&#150;    Fecal-oral transmission routes in a community.&#13;
   â&#150;    Good and bad hygiene behaviors that are putting people at risk.&#13;
   â&#150;    Primary and secondary barriers to block the transmission of disease.&#13;
5. At the end of this session, facilitator can provide brief information on how poor sanitation impacts&#13;
   well-being: e.g., number of deaths caused by diarrhea, a preventable disease, the toll it takes of&#13;
   childrenâ&#128;&#153;s lives. If possible, the facilitator should provide local examples of the impact of diarrhea on&#13;
   health, productivity and well-being.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Some participants may initially be shocked at being asked to identify fecal-oral transmission routes.&#13;
      There may be some disbelief that feces can be transmitted to the mouth and ingested.&#13;
      The best way to overcome this is to get the brainstorming started as soon as possible.&#13;
      Those participants who are more receptive than others will help to get those who are skeptical to&#13;
      get involved.&#13;
â&#150;      Do not be concerned if participants are not able to identify all fecal-oral transmission routes or if the&#13;
      routes identified does not conform to the F-diagram included in your Guidance Notes. It is enough&#13;
      that some routes have been identified and there is awareness of the link between open defecation&#13;
      and spread of diseases.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Understand how open defecation contaminates the environment.&#13;
â&#150;   See how sanitation is a primary barrier to prevent the spread of disease.&#13;

Unit 2.2 Experiences and Assessment of&#13;
Sanitation Programs&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Critically reflect on positive and negative learning experiences in implementing&#13;
                          sanitation programs&#13;
Time                      ~ 1 hour&#13;
Method                    Brainstorming in groups&#13;
Materials                 Flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Start this session by saying: Most of you have some                           Chart 1&#13;
   experience of sanitation programs or have been                                Name of Program â&#128;&#147;&#13;
   involved in the implementation of sanitation programs.                        Goal â&#128;&#147;&#13;
   The goal of this session is to learn more about the                           Indicators of Progress and&#13;
   approach that sanitation programs take to achieving                           Achievement&#13;
   their objectives.                                                             1.&#13;
2. Give each group an identical set of flip charts with the                      2.&#13;
   questions (see charts alongside). Ask groups to&#13;
   brainstorm on their questions and nominate at least&#13;
   two people to present the groupâ&#128;&#153;s findings.&#13;
3. Agree to the time required for discussion in&#13;
   consultation with the groups.                                                 Chart 2&#13;
4. Allow some time for discussion at the end of each                             What worked well?&#13;
   presentation. After each group has had a chance to                            What did not work well?&#13;
   present its findings, facilitate a discussion on:&#13;
   â&#150;    Key success factors for a sanitation program.&#13;
   â&#150;    What works? What does not work?&#13;
   â&#150;    Ways to improve the program.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      The facilitator needs to direct the discussion toward&#13;
      helping participants review and analyze their current                      Chart 3&#13;
      implementation strategy, and in the process realize                        Recommendations to improve&#13;
      whether efforts made so far are enough.                                    the program:&#13;
â&#150;      Try to encourage free discussion by giving suggestions                     1.&#13;
      but donâ&#128;&#153;t lead the participants.                                           2.&#13;
â&#150;      Once the group realizes that there is a need for an                        3.&#13;
      alternate implementation strategy, this forms the&#13;
      ground to introduce the community-driven total&#13;
      sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Understand the limitations of traditional approaches to promote sanitation.&#13;
â&#150;   Identify key success factors that drive results in a sanitation program.&#13;

Unit 2.3 Community-driven Total Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Introduce participants to community-driven total sanitation&#13;
Time                      ~2 hours&#13;
Method                    Film show, lecture and group discussion&#13;
Materials                 CD of film Parivartan ki Lahar, PC and projector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Tell participants that we now see a film on a sanitation program in Maharashtra, which will be followed&#13;
   by a group discussion.&#13;
2. After the screening, facilitate a discussion on:&#13;
   â&#150;      What are the differences between the sanitation project shown in this film and your project?&#13;
   â&#150;      What factors supported the success of the sanitation project shown in the film?&#13;
3. At this point, the trainer can make a brief presentation on community-driven total sanitation&#13;
   (see Attachment 6). Try to use a maximum of 15 flip charts/slides that summarize the main&#13;
   principles of a community-driven total sanitation. If possible, show photographs of the approach to&#13;
   help participants understand its practical implications.&#13;
4. Encourage participants to ask questions about the approach.&#13;
5. Close the session with a summary of the main principles of a community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Facilitators should familiarize themselves with the evolution, key features and progress achieved&#13;
      under the TSC program at the all-India level as well, specifically in the block/district/state where&#13;
      they are conducting the training. Information on this is provided in the Guidance Note â&#128;&#147; Module 1&#13;
      and Reference Materials â&#128;&#147; Module 3. The most recent updates, however, are posted online on the&#13;
      Web site of the Department of Drinking Water Supply of the Government of India &lt;http://ddws.nic.in&gt;&#13;
â&#150;      It is desirable that the session covers the following issues/discussion points:&#13;
       â&#128;&#147; What is total sanitation?&#13;
       â&#128;&#147; What is community-driven total sanitation?&#13;
       â&#128;&#147; What are the advantages of it being at the community level rather than the individual?&#13;
       â&#128;&#147; How does a community-driven total sanitation leading to creation of ODF villages deal with subsidies?&#13;
â&#150;      It is not necessary to use powerpoint to make the presentation on community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
      Facilitators should use the medium most appropriate to the level of the participants, e.g., flip charts&#13;
      or even extempore speech.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Understand the concept, approach and principles of community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
â&#150;   Distinguish between traditional and community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
            Give each group one of the scenarios given as Attachment 5 for discussion. This activity&#13;
            challenges participants to solve hypothetical problems related to both field situations and&#13;
            team dynamics. All questions are drawn from real situations that arose during fieldwork and&#13;
            are taken from Empowering Communities: Trainerâ&#128;&#153;s Handbook.&#13;
      Although some participants may complain about homework, this is a good exercise to do in the&#13;
      evening because it involves only discussion. In other words, they are not being asked to produce a&#13;
      group report or presentation. This exercise also facilitates teamwork by giving participants an&#13;
      opportunity to get to know each other better and decide who is appropriate for different team roles&#13;
      when they go for the field-level trainings.&#13;

     Evening Homework Task: Challenging Field&#13;
     Situations&#13;
         SCENARIO 1: What would you do if...&#13;
         1. Community members are very silent or reluctant to answer your questions?&#13;
         2. A member of your team is late again in the morning and the other team members are irritated?&#13;
         3. A team member is overenthusiastic and keeps interrupting the community members when they&#13;
            are speaking?&#13;
         4. The last triggering tool reveals new, important information that contradicts an earlier key finding?&#13;
         5. In the meeting with community members, a local leader tries to control decision-making?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         SCENARIO 2: What would you do if...&#13;
         1. In front of a group of community members, one member of your team contradicts what one of&#13;
            the community members has just said?&#13;
         2. The majority of the people in the village in which you have been working identify income&#13;
            generation as more important than the sanitation issues that you would like to address?&#13;
         3. Very few women have participated in the triggering exercises even though the issue of&#13;
            sanitation concerns them directly?&#13;
         4. One of your team members wants to leave before you are able to finish your teamwork?&#13;
         5. A very senior member of your organization wants to observe some of your fieldwork, but&#13;
            knows little about how to be a â&#128;&#152;sensitiveâ&#128;&#153; observer, and you are afraid he/she will lecture the&#13;
            community members?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         SCENARIO 3: What would you do if...&#13;
         1. After using participatory techniques well in training, your team cannot seem to get the hang of&#13;
            using them in the field?&#13;
         2. The information collected from women on the importance of different diseases contradicts the&#13;
            information collected from men?&#13;
         3. One of the team members accuses another one of making a rude remark and refuses to work&#13;
            with that person?&#13;
         4. One team member is not participating in discussions at the end of the day and doesnâ&#128;&#153;t help plan&#13;
            for the following day?&#13;
         5. An official, who has accompanied your team to the field, misrepresents the purpose of your work&#13;
            to the community?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         SCENARIO 4: What would you do if...&#13;
         1. You have asked a group of women to create a defecation map of their village, but they do not&#13;
            seem to know where to start?&#13;
         2. One team member is taking a condescending and patronizing attitude toward village women&#13;
            and tends to lecture instead of listening?&#13;
         3. During the defecation mapping, you notice that only the most educated and well-dressed men&#13;
            are dominating the discussion?&#13;
         4. The information in your village profile received before starting the fieldwork contradicts with&#13;
            what you are learning from community members?&#13;
         5. One of your team members prefers to work alone with community members and is always late&#13;
            getting back to your group meetings?&#13;

Unit 3.2 What is the Triggering Approach to&#13;
Behavior Change?&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Introduce the concept of triggering behavior change&#13;
Time                      ~ 30 minutes&#13;
Method                    Brainstorming&#13;
Materials                 Flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Explain the meaning of â&#128;&#152;triggering behavior changeâ&#128;&#153; with simple examples.&#13;
2. Ask participants to reflect for a few minutes and share their own experience of an event/action that&#13;
   caused them to change their behavior/habit or take action.&#13;
3. Help participants to see from their own experience that different triggers work for different people.&#13;
   Similarly, with total sanitation, different triggers work differently, depending on the local context.&#13;
   Triggering, therefore, does not work with a predetermined message but seeks to find out what&#13;
   causes people to change their behavior.&#13;
4. Ask participants to brainstorm on: what prompts people to change their behavior and stop open defecation?&#13;
5. After a few minutes, ask them to share their responses with the group. If necessary, start with an&#13;
   example of your own. Possible examples of triggers can be:&#13;
   â&#150;    Privacy/shame (among women and adolescent girls).&#13;
   â&#150;    Health.&#13;
   â&#150;    Fear (of darkness, wild animals, high medical expenses, etc.).&#13;
   â&#150;    Status (lack of toilet is embarrassing when guests visit from urban areas).&#13;
   â&#150;    Convenience (for elderly, pregnant ladies, children; during rains, night or illness).&#13;
   â&#150;    Water quality.&#13;
6. Now, ask participants to classify triggers according to whether they work at the individual or&#13;
   collective level, and note their responses on the flip chart. This can be done by underlining individual&#13;
   and community triggers in different colored markers or by labeling them separately as â&#128;&#152;Iâ&#128;&#153; or â&#128;&#152;Câ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
7. Facilitate a discussion on:&#13;
   â&#150;    Conventional supply-driven programs vs. triggering approach.&#13;
   â&#150;    Which triggers are likely to be more effective and sustainable at which level â&#128;&#147; community or&#13;
       individual? Why?&#13;

â&#150;      Keep the theoretical explanation of triggering as crisp as possible and try to prioritize time such that&#13;
      participants donâ&#128;&#153;t feel rushed during the mock practice.&#13;
â&#150;      The main differences between the approach of conventional supply-driven programs and triggering&#13;
      can be summarized as follows:&#13;

â&#150;      Sustainability of Individual vs. Community Triggers: what triggers behavior change in an&#13;
      individual is most often what â&#128;&#152;affectsâ&#128;&#153; and influences his/her life the most, be it status or dignity.&#13;
      However, behavior change triggered by such individual reasons is often sustained only till the reason&#13;
      remains in existence. For example, a family that opts to use a toilet because it is more convenient&#13;
      to defecate indoors during monsoons is likely to resume its older habit of open defecation when the&#13;
      season changes. The behavior change triggered in this manner is thus partial and does not give the&#13;
      desired sanitary outcomes in terms of a safe living environment.&#13;
&#13;
      By contrast, when a community realizes that their health is at stake due to their own habit or the&#13;
      habit of others to defecate in the open, the community collectively resolves to change its behavior.&#13;
      Once the process is initiated, members begin to monitor each otherâ&#128;&#153;s behavior within the&#13;
      community. Thus, the members who have a tendency to â&#128;&#152;fall backâ&#128;&#153; are also prevented from doing so&#13;
      due to the social pressure created after such a collective resolution. Behavior change, when&#13;
      triggered by such collective concerns or situations, is more likely to be sustained.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Understand the concept of triggering behavior change.&#13;
â&#150;   Identify individual and community triggers and explain why community triggers are more likely to&#13;
   be sustainable.&#13;
â&#150;   Distinguish between triggering and the conventional IEC approach to behavior change.&#13;

Unit 3.3 Facilitating Triggering: Attitude&#13;
and Methods&#13;
&#13;
Objectives            Introduce different types of triggering tools&#13;
Time                  1â&#128;&#147;1Â½ hours&#13;
Method                Lecture and group discussion&#13;
Materials             PC and projector, flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Some or all participants may be unfamiliar with participatory approaches. It may be useful to start&#13;
   the session by asking for a show of hands if participants have heard of participatory approaches or if&#13;
   they have experience of facilitating PRA (participatory rural appraisal) methods.&#13;
2. If a majority of participants are new to participatory approaches, explain that PRA consists of two&#13;
   main elements â&#128;&#147; Behavior and Attitudes and Methods:&#13;
&#13;
                                  Participatory Rural Appraisal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    P&#13;
                            Behavior and            R              Methods&#13;
                              Attitudes             A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Explain the elements of PRA as follows:&#13;
   PRA Behavior and Attitudes: these are key to successfully facilitating PRA methods. The kinds of&#13;
   behaviors and attitudes that are key to successful facilitation are:&#13;
   â&#150;   Respect for local knowledge: this means learning from local people instead of teaching or&#13;
      lecturing them. This requires active listening and awareness of the fact that as outsiders we may&#13;
      be better educated and have more exposure, but local people know much more about their&#13;
      situation than we do, no matter how concerned we may be.&#13;
   â&#150;   Flexibility and informality: this translates into both verbal and nonverbal communication,&#13;
      e.g., using simple language, observing local norms, etc.&#13;
   â&#150;   Offsetting biases: brainstorm with participants about when outsiders visit rural communities,&#13;
      where they tend to go, who they talk to and how long they stay. Through this facilitate a&#13;
      discussion on how to offset these biases.&#13;
4. Brainstorm with participants on the main differences between PRA and traditional approaches to&#13;
   data gathering in rural communities. Summarize key points on a flip chart.&#13;
5. PRA Methods: once you are convinced that participants have understood the behaviors and attitude&#13;
   that are key to successful facilitation of PRA, introduce them to the triggering methods or tools.&#13;
   These are nothing but PRA tools adapted to sanitation. A copy of the presentation â&#128;&#147; Types of&#13;
   Triggering Tools â&#128;&#147; is provided as Attachment 7. Spend time to describe each tool in the&#13;
   Presentation.&#13;

6. Allow time for Q&amp;A discussion after each tool and encourage participants to clarify any doubts.&#13;
   Try and summarize the â&#128;&#152;doâ&#128;&#153;s and donâ&#128;&#153;tsâ&#128;&#153; for each tool and particularly focus on the attitude of the&#13;
   facilitator when using these tools.&#13;
7. Ask participants to brainstorm on whether they can think of any trigger tool other than the ones&#13;
   covered in the presentation.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;   Facilitators must have a thorough knowledge of concepts and methods of the PRA approach and&#13;
   how this applies to sanitation.&#13;
â&#150;   Some participants may be skeptical about using participatory methods. To deal with this you can&#13;
   facilitate brief discussion on why we should use participatory methods. Some of the key reasons&#13;
   why participatory methods have succeeded where other methods have failed:&#13;
1. They are based on principles of adult education and have been field-tested extensively.&#13;
2. Field experience has shown that community workers find using participatory methods a far more&#13;
   rewarding approach.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. That said, the best way to deal with skeptics would be â&#128;&#152;learning by doingâ&#128;&#153;. The field-level training will&#13;
   help participants to clarify their doubts and understand the effectiveness of a participatory approach.&#13;
   Field experience shows that community workers who have tried participatory methods and found&#13;
   them worthwhile, usually donâ&#128;&#153;t want to return to their earlier methods.&#13;
â&#150;   Help participants to understand that the attitude and behavior of the facilitator are more important&#13;
   than the methods used to facilitate triggering.&#13;
â&#150;   Familiarize yourself with the triggering approach and types of triggers. Refer to Guidance Note 5:&#13;
   Triggering Behavior Change, and Guidance Note 6: Community-driven Total Sanitation Toolbox.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Understand that attitude and behavior of the facilitator is more important than the tools used to&#13;
   facilitate triggering.&#13;
â&#150;   Identify and describe different types of triggering tools.&#13;

                            Generally, facilitators&#13;
                        start with rapport-building&#13;
                   and then facilitate triggering based on&#13;

Unit 3.4 Facilitating Trigger Tools: Mock Session&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Participants get mock practice of using triggering tools in an informal setting&#13;
Time                      ~ 2 hours&#13;
Method                    Simulation&#13;
Materials                 Flip charts, markers, rangoli powder (yellow and other colors)&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Say you need around 10 volunteers to act as community members participating in the triggering&#13;
   process, a few others (say four participants) take up the facilitation role. Remaining participants act&#13;
   as observers to witness the triggering process. The mock session can take the following sequence:&#13;
   â&#150;   Group of facilitators visit the habitation, introduce themselves to the community and share their&#13;
      purpose of visit.&#13;
   â&#150;   Establish initial rapport with the community.&#13;
   â&#150;   Undertake all trigger tools involving the community according to the steps detailed earlier in&#13;
      the session.&#13;
   â&#150;   Workshop facilitators help the participants play different roles and provide necessary tips.&#13;
2. Switch roles among participants for different exercises so that everyone gets a chance to practice&#13;
   facilitating trigger tools.&#13;
3. After each triggering tool or step covered in the mock session, facilitate a discussion on:&#13;
   â&#150;   The experience of the participants in different roles.&#13;
   â&#150;   What did they find easy?&#13;
   â&#150;   What did they find difficult?&#13;
   â&#150;   Doâ&#128;&#153;s and donâ&#128;&#153;ts for facilitating different tools.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      For doâ&#128;&#153;s and donâ&#128;&#153;ts for facilitating different tools, refer to Guidance Note 6: Community-driven&#13;
      Approach to Total Sanitation â&#128;&#147; Toolbox.&#13;
â&#150;      There are many ways to conduct the mock session. Keeping an eye on the time allocated for this&#13;
      session, it is advisable to include at least one role play to demonstrate facilitation behaviors and&#13;
      attitudes and interviewing skills. Another simulation can focus on dividing participants into groups to&#13;
      practice creating a defecation map.&#13;
â&#150;      Encourage each participant to take an active part in this exercise. Always stress that everyone is&#13;
      equal and everyone must participate as equals.&#13;
â&#150;      Observe each participant or team practice carefully and note how each participant or team&#13;
      demonstrates the given task.&#13;
â&#150;      Be very critical but objective in giving feedback and try to use feedback as an opportunity to help&#13;
      them improve in the next sessions.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to demonstrate trigger tools and behavior in a role play&#13;

Unit 3.5 Planning for Field-level Training â&#128;&#147; I&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Provide role clarity to avoid confusion during fieldwork&#13;
Time                      30â&#128;&#147;45 minutes&#13;
Method                    Group discussion&#13;
Materials                 Brief profiles of the villages/communities to be visited&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Tell participants that each group will be visiting a different village for field-level training in triggering&#13;
   tools, accompanied by a trainer. Give each group a brief profile of the community that they are&#13;
   going to visit.&#13;
2. Explain to the groups that you would like them to identify members for different team roles&#13;
   (as opposed to trainers choosing members for roles). The team should select one person as the&#13;
   team leader and the others can act as both facilitators and note-takers. These roles imply the&#13;
   following responsibilities:&#13;
      â&#150; Facilitators: take the lead in facilitating trigger tools in the community. They ensure that all&#13;
       members of the community are given a chance to participate. Facilitators should have excellent&#13;
       interpersonal skills, and be flexible and patient.&#13;
    â&#150;   Note-takers: observe and record proceedings of the day, including both handwritten notes and&#13;
       copies of maps or diagrams drawn by the community on the ground. In addition to writing down&#13;
       the exchange of views during activities, note-takers should also record the group dynamics.&#13;
       A note-taker should be observant, a good listener and familiar with the local language.&#13;
Note: Participants should be encouraged to switch roles (facilitator/note-taker) during the field-level&#13;
training, but it is helpful if the team leader remains the same.&#13;
3. Ask field teams to brainstorm on:&#13;
    â&#150;   How they can introduce themselves to their communities?&#13;
    â&#150;   What they will tell the communities about the purpose of their visit?&#13;
    â&#150;   What type of background information they need on the community, e.g., population, sanitation&#13;
       status, caste politics, etc.?&#13;
    â&#150;   Which trigger tools they would like to practice and how?&#13;
    â&#150;   Team contract/code of behavior â&#128;&#147; ask participants to reflect on the evening homework on&#13;
       challenging field scenarios and use those situations as a base on which to think about codes of&#13;
       conduct for team members.&#13;

â&#150;      District administration should provide brief profiles of the villages selected for the field study.&#13;
      This can include the following information:&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Name of Sarpanch and contact number.&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Location (which block?) and estimated travel time from training venue.&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Brief description of community (e.g., number of households (APL/BPL), main occupation,&#13;
         average income, existing latrine coverage).&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Local customs that need to be observed by participants.&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Communityâ&#128;&#153;s expectations from the participants (what have communities been told about the&#13;
         participantsâ&#128;&#153; visit?).&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Are there any Government-sponsored sanitation programs under way in the village?&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Have there been any recent outbreaks of water-borne diseases in the village or nearby?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;      During the first field-level training, the trainers will take on many of the responsibilities of a team&#13;
      leader including arranging logistics for the fieldwork, introducing the team members to the&#13;
      community, ensuring activities stay on schedule and moderating conflict between team members.&#13;
      Instruct participants to observe carefully as they will have to take on the role of team leader in&#13;
      subsequent field-level training.&#13;
â&#150;      On purpose of visit, it is best if participants remain as vague as possible when discussing this with&#13;
      the communities. It is best to say that they have been invited by the district to learn about the&#13;
      community. It is important that participants do not raise the expectation of the community about&#13;
      getting money or any other type of assistance.&#13;
â&#150;      Since participants only have a few hours in the field, it may not be possible to practice all the&#13;
      triggering tools. Therefore, they shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t plan too many activities or rush to fit in more activities.&#13;
      It is better to practice a few tools thoroughly than to do many tools rapidly, e.g., mapping is a&#13;
      good activity to do on the first field visit since it serves as an icebreaker, and lots of people&#13;
      can participate.&#13;
â&#150;      Each team needs to work out a team contract or code of behavior. It may be useful for participants&#13;
      to think back to their evening homework task and the challenging field situation scenarios.&#13;
â&#150;      Participants also need to develop signals or signs that they can use to communicate messages with&#13;
      each other, e.g., passing a pen to the speaker or touching their right ear if a team member has&#13;
      talked too long.&#13;
â&#150;      Ensure that logistics and field kits are in place for each team going to the field.&#13;
â&#150;      A packed lunch can be served on the way to the field.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Understand their roles and responsibilities during field-level training.&#13;
â&#150;   Understand the importance of planning ahead for fieldwork.&#13;

3. Once the presentations are ready, ask nominated                                 â&#150;  What did you find difficult?&#13;
&#13;
   representatives from each group to come forward&#13;
   and make their presentation to the plenary. Each&#13;
   group should be prepared to answer any specific&#13;
   questions that may arise, but a more general&#13;
   discussion or debate should be limited until each&#13;
   group has had a chance to make its presentation.&#13;
4. When the groups are presenting, make a note of                                Chart 3&#13;

5. After the presentations, facilitate a discussion on:                            â&#150;  Which tools did you find least&#13;
   â&#150;    Similarities and differences in the experiences                               effective? Why?&#13;

â&#150;      Stress that presentations do not need to be                          â&#150;  What would you do differently&#13;
&#13;
      elaborate or formal. The most important aspect is                      when you go to the field again?&#13;
      the team reflection that takes place during the&#13;
      preparation of the presentation.&#13;
â&#150;      Facilitatorâ&#128;&#153;s feedback to the participants on the&#13;
      field activities is of great significance since it helps&#13;
      them identify common mistakes, clarify doubts and&#13;
      fine-tune their skills. Therefore, it is essential to invest considerable time in this session.&#13;
â&#150;      Emphasize that there is no pressure on participants to create ODF villages through the&#13;
      field-level training! Instead, fieldwork is an opportunity to learn facilitation skills, where&#13;
      process is more important than the results.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;

Unit 5.3 Triggering Outcomes and Next Steps&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Participants learn to recognize and classify triggering outcomes and related strategies&#13;
Time                      45â&#128;&#147;60 minutes&#13;
Method                    Brainstorming and group discussion&#13;
Materials                 Flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. This unit is a continuation of the discussion on the field visits by the groups. Summarize the&#13;
   classification of villages by type of triggering outcome as provided by the teams and ask&#13;
   participants to brainstorm for a few minutes about what these outcomes imply. Facilitate a&#13;
   discussion on:&#13;
   â&#150;   Meaning of different types of outcomes.&#13;
   â&#150;   How they differ from one another.&#13;
&#13;
      1. Fully triggered (matchbox in a gas station) refers to a situation where everyone agrees to stop&#13;
         open defecation and start the action immediately.&#13;
      2. Almost fully triggered (promising flames) is a situation where most of the people have agreed.&#13;
      3. Little triggered (scattered sparks) is a situation where the majority is undecided, but few&#13;
         individuals in the community agree to act promptly.&#13;
      4. Zero triggered (damp matchbox) is a situation where triggering exercises were not able to elicit&#13;
         any positive response at all.&#13;
&#13;
2. At this stage, ask each group to brainstorm for about 10 minutes on how they map the village they&#13;
   visited as per the above classification.&#13;
3. Next, brainstorm with participants on possible interventions for different types of triggering&#13;
   outcomes. Note down the main points on a flip chart and help participants to come to a consensus&#13;
   on next steps for different types of triggering outcomes. Close the session with a summary of the&#13;
   main points.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      The main types of triggering outcomes and related intervention strategies are provided as a&#13;
      presentation in Attachment 8. However, the facilitator should try to use brainstorming and group&#13;
      discussion to explain the main types of triggering outcomes.&#13;
â&#150;      Emphasize that triggering and its outcomes are not mutually exclusive, and these outcomes can be&#13;
      visualized as points along a continuum. This means that a community which is classified as fully&#13;
      triggered or matchbox in a gas station may become a damp matchbox at your next visit or the&#13;
      opposite may happen.&#13;
â&#150;      Stress the importance of consistent effort to motivate community members toward changing&#13;
      behavior to end open defecation and prevent â&#128;&#152;fall-backâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
By the end of this session, participants are able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Recognize and classify triggering outcomes.&#13;
â&#150;   Identify next steps based on the type of triggering outcome.&#13;

    â&#128;&#147; At the end, ask them if they would be                at all interested to initiate any local action&#13;
       interested to visit and see any village where   â&#150;    Suggested intervention strategy:&#13;

SESSION 6: ELEMENTS TO SUPPORT BEHAVIOR&#13;
CHANGE&#13;
Unit 6.1 Briefing on Elements to Support&#13;
Behavior Change&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Participants are able to identify the key factors required to sustain behavior&#13;
                          change, post-triggering&#13;
Time                      25â&#128;&#147;30 minutes&#13;
Method                    Brainstorming&#13;
Materials                 Flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Explain that ignition alone is not sufficient. Various elements are needed to support behavior change&#13;
   for community-driven total sanitation to achieve sustainable results on the ground.&#13;
2. Brainstorm with the participants on elements required to support behavior change. If necessary, get&#13;
   the ideas flowing with an example of your own.&#13;
3. Help participants to come to a consensus on the key elements required to support behavior change&#13;
   and write these down on a flip chart. This list can include the following:&#13;
   â&#150;    Sanitation technology options.&#13;
   â&#150;    Availability of sanitation products and skilled masons.&#13;
   â&#150;    Hygiene behaviors.&#13;
   â&#150;    Incentives and rewards.&#13;
   â&#150;    Community monitoring.&#13;
   â&#150;    Follow-up by district and block teams.&#13;
4. Tell participants that we will try and understand each of these elements in more detail in&#13;
   subsequent sessions.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Do not be concerned if participants are not able to identify all the elements needed to support&#13;
      behavior change toward ending open defecation. It is enough at this stage that some elements have&#13;
      been identified and there is awareness of the multidimensional nature of behavior change.&#13;
â&#150;      Help participants to see that these elements are not mutually exclusive and should be seen as a set&#13;
      of interlinked activities necessary to support sustainability of behavior change.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Identify the elements required to support and sustain behavior change.&#13;
â&#150;   Understand that the elements to support behavior change are interlinked.&#13;

Unit 6.2 Sanitation Technology Options and&#13;
Supply Chain&#13;
&#13;
Objectives             Participants identify step-by-step options for improving a communityâ&#128;&#153;s sanitation&#13;
                       status&#13;
Time                   ~ 1 hour&#13;
Method                 Sanitation ladder&#13;
Materials              Drawings/cards of sanitation options, big chart/sheet on which drawings can be&#13;
                       pinned, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Based on the local context, prepare a sanitation ladder indicating the type of sanitation options to&#13;
   choose from, ranging from â&#128;&#152;least desirableâ&#128;&#153;, e.g., open defecation to â&#128;&#152;most desirableâ&#128;&#153;, e.g., pour flush&#13;
   latrine, a sample of sanitation ladder is included in Attachment 9.&#13;
2. Give each group an identical set of drawings/cards with different sanitation options depicted on&#13;
   them, with the words:&#13;
   Look at these options and, as a group, brainstorm on how you can arrange them as a ladder.&#13;
   Try to start with the one you consider the worst option at the bottom and the one you consider the&#13;
   best option at the top.&#13;
3. Agree with the groups on the time they will take to complete the task. This should take around&#13;
   15 minutes.&#13;
4. Now, visit each group and give them the next task:&#13;
   Based on your experience in the field, classify where the community you interacted with is at&#13;
   present and where you would like it to be in a year from now. Discuss the advantages and difficulties&#13;
   you may face in trying to move to different steps on the ladder.&#13;
5. When the groups have completed this task, ask each group to explain its sanitation ladder&#13;
   to participants.&#13;
6. After the presentation, encourage a group discussion covering the following points:&#13;
   â&#150;    Similarities and differences in the way that groups arranged the options.&#13;
   â&#150;    Advantages and limitations of each option.&#13;
   â&#150;    Options that are feasible in the location where the training is being undertaken.&#13;
   â&#150;    Problems that may come up while implementing different options or moving up the ladder.&#13;
7. Encourage the group to consider the different ladders presented and agree on one sanitation ladder.&#13;
8. Use this discussion as an entry point to discuss different technology options.&#13;
9. After this discussion, groups may want to change their sanitation ladders. Brainstorm with the&#13;
   groups on what a sanitation ladder would look like in a typical community in their district.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
1. Before starting this activity, carefully read Guidance Note 7: â&#128;&#152;Sanitation Technologiesâ&#128;&#153; and ensure that&#13;
   you understand:&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; Design principles of different sanitation options.&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; Supply chain issues such as availability of products and skilled masons.&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; Ongoing operation and maintenance requirements of each option.&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; Costs â&#128;&#147; fixed and variable â&#128;&#147; and affordability.&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; Operation and maintenance requirements.&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; Subsidies available.&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; Durability of the structure.&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; Sustainability.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;      The issue of subsidies needs to be facilitated carefully. By this time in the training program,&#13;
      participants have been exposed to the community-driven total sanitation which negates subsidies.&#13;
      However, under Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) program, subsidies have been provided for below&#13;
      poverty line (BPL) households. Help participants to see that:&#13;
â&#150;      Subsidized toilet construction without demand generation results in lack of usage of facilities&#13;
      constructed.&#13;
â&#150;      To ensure that latrines are constructed under a demand-led approach, subsidies should be given&#13;
      after construction as a reward for achievement of ODF status.&#13;
â&#150;      The sanitation ladder shows that improvements can be made step-by-step. The idea that a&#13;
      community can progress up a ladder at different rates can be very appealing to groups. They realize&#13;
      that changes can be made over time, at a manageable pace. When groups discover this, it can&#13;
      inspire them to become more involved.&#13;
â&#150;      Some options can be equally good. So, two options can be placed side by side, i.e., the ladder can&#13;
      have branches. The idea of choosing for the future and progression is more important than the shape&#13;
      of the ladder.&#13;
&#13;
2. Instructions to Trainer on drawings of sanitation options.&#13;
   1. Print each drawing on a separate page to form one set.&#13;
   2. A4 size prints are ideal.&#13;
   3. Make copies of the set as per the number of groups formed.&#13;
   4. Give each group an identical set of drawings to create their sanitation ladders.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
By the end of this unit, participants will be able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Identify different technology options.&#13;
â&#150;   Understand the criteria for choosing appropriate and affordable sanitation technologies.&#13;
â&#150;   Understand that improvements in the sanitation status can be made step-by-step over time.&#13;

Unit 6.3 Choosing Improved Hygiene Behaviors&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Participants learn how to identify which hygiene behaviors they want to change,&#13;
                          encourage or reinforce&#13;
Time                      45â&#128;&#147;60 minutes&#13;
Method                    Lecture and brainstorming&#13;
Materials                 Fecal-oral transmission routes and barriers identified by participants in Unit 2.1, flip&#13;
                          charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Refer to the transmission routes and barriers identified by participants in Unit 2.1: â&#128;&#152;How to Prevent&#13;
   the Spread of Diseasesâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
2. Brainstorm with the groups to make two lists: one with hygiene behaviors that they consider healthy and&#13;
   want to promote, and second with hygiene behaviors that they consider unhealthy and want to discourage.&#13;
3. From this classification, help participants to see that hygiene education is a potentially vast topic&#13;
   and they need to decide which hygiene behaviors they will focus on. In order to establish this focus,&#13;
   participants must analyze the local context to see which hygienic and unhygienic behaviors are&#13;
   widespread in a community.&#13;
4. Methods that can be used to obtain this information are:&#13;
   â&#150;    Community survey; and/or.&#13;
   â&#150;    Pocket chart: To set it up, use a chart with pockets. Across the horizontal axis, set up drawings&#13;
       or cards related to the hygiene behavior being investigated. Across the vertical axis, identify&#13;
       different types of individuals e.g. man, woman, child. To use a pocket chart, a person has to&#13;
       answer two questions: firstly, which drawing describes me? and secondly, which hygiene option&#13;
       applies to me? Based on the answer, the person has to identify which pocket to put his token/slip&#13;
       into that best indicates which option(s) he/she uses.&#13;
5. Ask participants if they can think of any other tool, besides survey and pocket chart, to find out&#13;
   information about hygiene practices in a community?&#13;
6. Based on the information that participants have about hygiene behaviors, brainstorm with them on&#13;
       next steps. This could include:&#13;
   â&#150;    Which hygiene behaviors are most prevalent and why?&#13;
   â&#150;    How to reach a consensus on which good and bad hygiene behaviors are most important to work on?&#13;
   â&#150;    How to influence a community to: (a) accept new behaviors; (b) use them all the time; and&#13;
       (c) discontinue bad hygiene behaviors? (this discussion leads into the next unit on incentives to&#13;
       support behavior change).&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Past experience has shown that programs that include changes in both hygiene behaviors and&#13;
      sanitation facilities are more effective in controlling diarrheal diseases than those that focus on&#13;
      sanitation facilities alone.&#13;
â&#150;      The pocket chart is a simple and effective tool for collecting information. Some tips for using this&#13;
      tool in the field are as follows:&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Stress the need for people to be honest when casting their tokens. To facilitate this, a pocket chart&#13;
         can be set up in such a way that participants can place their tokens without being seen by others.&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Since this activity can be time-consuming, it is better to do it during a break or combine it with an&#13;
         activity that keeps a majority of the group occupied while individuals are casting their tokens.&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Tokens can be counted in front of everyone to ensure transparency and accuracy.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Distinguish between hygienic and unhygienic behaviors.&#13;
â&#150;   Realize that it is important not to focus exclusively on sanitation technologies at the expense of&#13;
   hygiene behaviors.&#13;

                       adopting improved sanitation and hygiene behaviors&#13;
Time                   30â&#128;&#147;45 minutes&#13;
Method                 Brainstorming and group discussion&#13;
Materials              Handouts of Attachment 10 â&#128;&#147; FAQs on NGP, PC with projector&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Begin the discussion by asking participants what kinds of rewards or incentives are available to&#13;
   communities/local governments to adopt safe sanitation at the collective level.&#13;
2. Use this discussion as an entry point to discuss the Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP) in detail. You may&#13;
   start by asking for a show of hands in response to the questions that â&#128;&#152;who has heard about the&#13;
   Nirmal Gram Puraskar?â&#128;&#153; Then, ask for volunteers to explain the details of the scheme to the group.&#13;
3. Facilitate a group discussion on NGP which should cover:&#13;
   â&#150;    What is the objective of the scheme?&#13;
   â&#150;    What are the eligibility criteria?&#13;
   â&#150;    What is the cash amount given under NGP?&#13;
   â&#150;    How many NGPs has the district received where the training is being held?&#13;
   â&#150;    How does this districtâ&#128;&#153;s NGP performance compare with other districts in the state?&#13;
   â&#150;    How does the stateâ&#128;&#153;s performance compare with other states?&#13;
4. Now, refer to sanitation ladders made by the groups. Ask the participants to identify at which step a&#13;
   village will be considered a Nirmal Gram. Now, help participants to see that the Nirmal Gram is&#13;
   actually a state in between the worst and the best options. Use this discussion to introduce the&#13;
   concept of rewards or incentives to motivate communities to move from the worst option to Nirmal&#13;
   Gram to Adarsh Gram.&#13;
5. Brainstorm with the participants on the types of rewards or incentives that can be given at each&#13;
   stage. Some options are:&#13;
&#13;
 Status                      Specific                               Incentive/Rewards Common&#13;

Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Before starting this activity, make sure that you are aware of the details of different types of rewards&#13;
      or incentives.&#13;
â&#150;      Rewards tend to create hype and generate recognition of a communityâ&#128;&#153;s achievements. However, a&#13;
      reward should not become a one-time activity or end in itself. Instead, help participants to see how&#13;
      different types of rewards can be used effectively to incentivize and sustain changed behavior in&#13;
      a community.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Identify key features of the NGP.&#13;
â&#150;   Understand types of rewards and incentives that can be given to motivate communities to move up&#13;
   the sanitation ladder.&#13;

     application forms are available on www.ddws.nic.in, which can be downloaded. If required, the same&#13;
     can be translated in local language by the State government or Project Implementing Agencies and&#13;
     circulated to all the eligible applicants.&#13;
&#13;
     The applications should be duly scrutinized at the district level and only on being fully satisfied with&#13;
     regard to the eligibility, it should be forwarded to the State government. The State government should&#13;
     make its own arrangement for the verification of the claims. There are two checklists for the two types&#13;
     of application forms, which are also hosted on www.ddws.nic.in. The checklist should be filled in and&#13;
     certified by the State Secretary in charge of Rural Sanitation and forwarded to the Department of&#13;
     Drinking Water Supply, Ministry of Rural Development.&#13;

4. What is the procedure of sanctioning of Nirmal Gram Puraskar?&#13;
Once the GoI receives the Nirmal Gram Puraskar applications from the State Government, the same&#13;
are scrutinized by the Screening Committee in the Department of Drinking Water Supply, which is&#13;
headed by JS (DWS). The Screening Committee will screen the prima facie eligible applications and&#13;
give the same to review teams to verify in the field. Three review teams based on Zones have been&#13;
constituted which will verify the applications as found prima facie eligible by the Screening Committee.&#13;
On the basis of report submitted by the review teams, the Screening Committee will make&#13;
recommendations to the National Committee of Nirmal Gram Puraskar headed by Secretary (DWS),&#13;
which will finally approve the applications eligible for Puraskars.&#13;
&#13;
5. For what purpose can the incentive money be utilized?&#13;
The incentive for Panchayati Raj Institutions can be used for improving and maintaining sanitation facilities&#13;
in their respective areas. The focus should be on solid and liquid waste disposal and maintenance of the&#13;
sanitation standard.&#13;

Unit 6.5 Community Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
Objectives             Participants learn how to establish a procedure for checking progress&#13;
Time                   45â&#128;&#147;60 minutes&#13;
Method                 Lecture and brainstorming&#13;
Materials              Flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Present definitions of monitoring and evaluation and ask participants if there is anything they would&#13;
   like to add. Ask them to brainstorm on indicators for monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
   â&#150;    Monitoring is an ongoing process of data collection that enables the community and project&#13;
       managers to understand what is working well and what is not working well, and adjust their&#13;
       strategies accordingly. Monitoring tracks processes and outputs. Examples of monitoring&#13;
       indicators include:&#13;
       â&#128;&#147; Number of latrines constructed.&#13;
       â&#128;&#147; Amount of money spent.&#13;
   â&#150;    Evaluation refers to the measurement of project outcomes (short-term effects) and impacts&#13;
       (long-term effects). In other words, evaluation measures whether a project has achieved its goal.&#13;
       Examples of evaluation indicators include:&#13;
       â&#128;&#147; Percentage reduction in diarrhea-related infant deaths.&#13;
       â&#128;&#147; Percentage increase in life expectancy.&#13;
2. Now, facilitate a discussion on monitoring and evaluation in the context of community-driven total&#13;
   sanitation. Some questions to cover include:&#13;
   â&#150;    How can M&amp;E be made participatory?&#13;
       This can be done by building the capacity of community members to track their own progress.&#13;
       One way to do this is to ask community members to volunteer for membership of sanitation&#13;
       monitoring committees. Separate committees can be set up for different parts of the village,&#13;
       based on recognized administrative divisions or number of households, e.g., each committee of&#13;
       five members is responsible for monitoring the sanitation status of a cluster of 30-35 households.&#13;
       Members of these committees can be youths, mothers, children or residents of a particular&#13;
       section of the village. The committees can meet on a monthly basis or nominate a member to&#13;
       represent the progress in their area to the Sarpanch or community leader responsible for the&#13;
       communityâ&#128;&#153;s sanitation status.&#13;
   â&#150;    What to measure in track progress? Is it number of latrines or number of ODF households/villages?&#13;
   â&#150;    How to measure progress being made?&#13;
       One way is to use a social map as a tracking tool, different colored bindis can be used to track&#13;
       the sanitation status of different households on the map. This map should be kept in the village&#13;
       community hall such that it is visible to all and it should be regularly updated.&#13;
   â&#150;    When and how often should progress be measured? How does timing/seasonality impact&#13;
       M&amp;E results?&#13;
   â&#150;    Who should be responsible for measuring progress? External experts or community members?&#13;
       Participatory M&amp;E does not exclude the role of Government or NGOs. On the contrary,&#13;
       successful participatory M&amp;E requires support from the highest levels in these organizations.&#13;
3. In participatory M&amp;E, community members track the progress of their own development such that&#13;
   the community can make its own decisions about:&#13;
   â&#150;    What is working well?&#13;
   â&#150;    What is not working well?&#13;
   â&#150;    How to proceed next?&#13;

   4. Ask participants to brainstorm on possible indicators for participatory monitoring and evaluation of a&#13;
      communityâ&#128;&#153;s progress toward becoming ODF and help them to reach a consensus on how these can&#13;
      be operationalized.&#13;
&#13;
   Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
   â&#150;      Use simple language and try not to confuse participants with overdue emphasis on terminology&#13;
         (process/output/impact).&#13;
   â&#150;      Remind participants that simple systems work best and to prioritize based on what can realistically&#13;
         be measured and what information is needed to improve decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
   Learning Outcomes&#13;
   By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;
   â&#150;   Differentiate between monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
   â&#150;   Define what is participatory monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
   â&#150;   Develop indicators and outlines of a process to implement participatory monitoring of&#13;
      community-driven total sanitation.&#13;

&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Explain to participants that we will be undertaking a second visit to the field to practice facilitation&#13;
   skills. Provide participants with brief profiles of villages selected for the field study.&#13;
2. Request the groups to identify members for different team roles as was done in Unit 3.5. Groups&#13;
   should rotate roles among members, such that those who were facilitators for certain activities last&#13;
   time can be observers this time, and vice versa.&#13;
3. The team leader nominated by the group would take charge of overseeing the field visit, ensuring&#13;
   activities stay on schedule and moderating conflict between team members.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      In the second field visit, participants should have the confidence to facilitate triggering on their own.&#13;
      Trainer should provide inputs only if absolutely necessary. As far as possible, encourage&#13;
      participants to take responsibility for their own learning.&#13;
â&#150;      For other notes, refer to Unit 4.1.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:&#13;
â&#150;   Develop confidence to undertake facilitating of triggering tools with minimal trainer inputs.&#13;

SESSION 7: FIELD-LEVEL TRAINING â&#128;&#147; II&#13;
Unit 7.1 Field-level Training â&#128;&#147; II&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Participants gain experience of facilitating trigger tools in a real-life setting&#13;
Time                      ~ 4 hours&#13;
Method                    Fieldwork&#13;
Materials                 Field kit to be prepared for each group with the following items: rangoli powders in&#13;
                          different colors, notebooks, pens, chart papers, markers, chalk&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
Participants visit different villages in their teams and apply the triggering tools that they have learnt.&#13;
These include:&#13;
   â&#150;    Rapport-building.&#13;
   â&#150;    Defecation transect/walk of shame.&#13;
   â&#150;    Defecation mapping.&#13;

   â&#150;    Flow diagram.&#13;
   â&#150;    Calculation of medical expenses.&#13;
   â&#150;    Water quality testing.&#13;
   â&#150;    (how to facilitate) Decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      After field-level training, it is important to have informal interactive sessions with the groups to&#13;
      collect feedback.&#13;
&#13;

Unit 7.2 Feedback on Field-level Training â&#128;&#147; II&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Consolidate learnings from fieldwork&#13;
Time                      ~2 hours&#13;
Method                    Experience-sharing&#13;
Materials                 Presentations made by groups on first field visit, flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Explain to participants that unlike the first feedback session, this one will focus on how the&#13;
   experience of the second visit was different from the first visit and what they learnt.&#13;
2. Give each group a set of paper cards. Ask them to brainstorm in their groups on:&#13;
   â&#150;    How was this field visit different from the first field visit?&#13;
   â&#150;    What processes were adopted prior, during and after different tools?&#13;
   â&#150;    What were the findings of each tool?&#13;
   â&#150;    What did you enjoy most about the fieldwork?&#13;
   â&#150;    What did you find difficult?&#13;
   â&#150;    What would you do differently if you went to the field again?&#13;
3. Groups should write only each point in clear letters on separate cards and they can use as many&#13;
   cards as they like. Agree to the time required to make the presentation in consultation with the&#13;
   groups.&#13;
4. While the groups are brainstorming, set up a sheet/chart with four cards with the above mentioned&#13;
   questions on them.&#13;
5. To present the groupâ&#128;&#153;s findings, each group should nominate at least two members. Those who have&#13;
   not made a presentation before should be given a chance to represent the group.&#13;
6. Once the groups have prepared the cards, ask nominated representatives from each group to come&#13;
   forward and make their presentation to the plenary. Each group should be prepared to answer any&#13;
   specific questions that may arise, but a more general discussion or debate should be limited until&#13;
   each group has had a chance to make its presentation.&#13;
7. Stick the cards prepared by each group under the appropriate label on the chart/sheet.&#13;
8. After the presentations, facilitate a discussion on:&#13;
   â&#150;    Similarities and differences between the second and the first field visit.&#13;
   â&#150;    Similarities and differences in the experiences of different teams.&#13;
   â&#150;    Doâ&#128;&#153;s and Donâ&#128;&#153;ts for facilitating different triggering tools.&#13;
&#13;
                         How was this          What did you              What did you                  Recommendations&#13;
                           field visit          enjoy most               find difficult?&#13;
                         different from          about the&#13;
                         the first one?         fieldwork?&#13;
&#13;
     Group 1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Since this is the second time that groups are making a presentation on the field visit, this feedback&#13;
      session should be shorter than the first one in duration.&#13;
â&#150;      For other Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes, refer to Unit 5.2.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
Participants gain confidence in their ability to facilitate triggering.&#13;

SESSION 8: ANALYZING NEXT STEPS&#13;
Unit 8.1 Facilitation Skills&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                To orient the participants on essential skills of facilitation&#13;
Time                      ~45 minutes&#13;
Method                    Brainstorming and presentation&#13;
Materials                 Flip charts, cards, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Explain to the participants that effective facilitation is very essential for achieving the&#13;
   training objectives.&#13;
2. Request each group to brainstorm on the attributes of: (a) an effective trainer; and (b) an ineffective&#13;
   trainer. They may draw on their experience of this and previous trainings to come up with at least&#13;
   two points on each type of trainer.&#13;
3. While participants are writing their points, stick two charts â&#128;&#147; one for attributes of an â&#128;&#152;effective trainerâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
   and other for attributes of an â&#128;&#152;ineffective trainerâ&#128;&#153;. Later, request each group to nominate a volunteer&#13;
   to paste the cards on the sheets.&#13;
4. Consolidate all points and give your inputs on â&#128;&#152;what makes an effective facilitatorâ&#128;&#153; (refer to Guidance&#13;
   Note 1: Introduction to Participatory Training).&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Trainers should familiarize themselves with the concept of participatory training and the attributes&#13;
      (knowledge, attitude and skills) essential for effective facilitation.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcomes&#13;
â&#150;      Participants will be able to distinguish effective and ineffective facilitation.&#13;
â&#150;      Participants show inclination to model their behavior and attitudes on the lines of the attributes they&#13;
      have defined to describe an â&#128;&#152;effective trainerâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;

Unit 8.2 How to Design a Participatory&#13;
Training Program?&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Consolidate learnings from the training program and fieldwork&#13;
Time                      ~1 Â½ hours&#13;
Method                    Presentation by volunteers and group discussion&#13;
Materials                 Flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Ask participants:&#13;
   As a master trainer, how would you design a training program on community-driven total sanitation?&#13;
2. Begin by facilitating a brainstorming session on what are the key issues that they would have to&#13;
   think about when designing a program. Consolidate all points, and provide trainer inputs to ensure&#13;
   that at least the following are covered:&#13;
   â&#150;    Assessment of training needs and learnerâ&#128;&#153;s objectives.&#13;
   â&#150;    Trainersâ&#128;&#153; attitude and behavior.&#13;
   â&#150;    Group size and selection of participants.&#13;
   â&#150;    Training venue and seating arrangements.&#13;
   â&#150;    Logistics.&#13;
   â&#150;    Training approach and methods (see Guidance Note 1: Introduction to Participatory Training).&#13;
   â&#150;    Design of the program and sessions (classroom and fieldwork and relative weight to be given&#13;
       to each).&#13;
   â&#150;    Communicating effectively.&#13;
   â&#150;    Responding to group dynamics.&#13;
3. Now, ask participants to brainstorm on each of these issues in their groups to come up with a&#13;
   framework to design a training program.&#13;
4. Agree with the groups on the time required for discussion. Request each group to nominate at least&#13;
   two people to present the groupâ&#128;&#153;s findings. Those who have not made a presentation before should&#13;
   be given a chance to represent the group.&#13;
5. Each group should be prepared to answer any specific questions that may arise, but a more general&#13;
   discussion or debate should be limited until each group has had a chance to make its presentation.&#13;
6. Consolidate the main points of each group presentation on a flip chart.&#13;
7. After each group has presented, facilitate a discussion on:&#13;
   â&#150;    Similarities and differences in the groupâ&#128;&#153;s design of the training program.&#13;
   â&#150;    Best practice tips for designing a training program.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Help groups to focus on the principles for designing an effective training program.&#13;
â&#150;      Encourage groups to think back on the past four days of training and reflect on these observations&#13;
      to design their training â&#128;&#147; what worked? What did not work? What would they do differently?&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
Participants understand the principles for designing a participatory training program.&#13;

Unit 8.3 Briefing on Preparation of Action Plans&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Participants understand the key elements of action planning and contents of a&#13;
                          model action plan&#13;
Time                      30â&#128;&#147;45 minutes&#13;
Method                    Overview of Action Plan â&#128;&#147; Analogy&#13;
Materials                 Flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Introduce the topic of Action Plans by explaining that the key outcome of this training is not just&#13;
   knowledge creation, but an Action Plan for master trainers to create a cadre of motivators in the&#13;
   district to scale up community-driven total sanitation for achieving ODF outcomes.&#13;
2. Since participants may not be familiar with the concept of an Action Plan, an analogy can be used to&#13;
   explain this. Some examples are:&#13;
   â&#150;    Making a chapatti.&#13;
   â&#150;    Driving a vehicle.&#13;
3. Use the analogy to facilitate a discussion on:&#13;
   â&#150;    What is an Action Plan?&#13;
   â&#150;    What are the key ingredients of an Action Plan?&#13;
4. On the basis of this discussion, help the participants to develop a framework for Action Planning&#13;
   which can be applied to scaling up total sanitation in their district.&#13;
5. Note the main points of the framework on a flip chart.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      As many participants may be unfamiliar with developing an Action Plan, the objective of this session&#13;
      is to clarify what is meant by an Action Plan.&#13;
â&#150;      The analogy with a familiar object or process helps participants to see that action planning is not a&#13;
      technical activity but simply a process of identifying the steps to be taken toward achieving a goal.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
Participants understand the expected outcome of training and have a framework for developing an&#13;
Action Plan.&#13;

&#13;
Unit 9.2 Getting Started: Setting a Goal for the&#13;
Action Plan&#13;
Objectives                Participants set a goal as a first step toward developing an Action Plan&#13;
Time                      ~ 30 minutes&#13;
Method                    Brainstorming in groups&#13;
Materials                 Flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Tell participants that they will not      Name of Block &amp; District:&#13;
   be sitting in their groups today.&#13;
   Instead, make new groups such             Name of Group:&#13;
   that all the persons from one             No. of Members:&#13;
   block are sitting together.&#13;
2. Give each group a chart with the          No.        Name of Member               Phone No.&#13;
   following table. Request each&#13;
   group to nominate one person to fill&#13;
   in the table with membersâ&#128;&#153; details.&#13;
3. Refer to the briefing on&#13;
   preparation of Action Plans from the previous day and ask participants to clarify any questions they&#13;
   may have on the framework for action planning, before introducing the topic of setting a goal.&#13;
4. Now, refer to the sanitation ladders made by the groups on Day 3, and say: Do you agree that this&#13;
   [point to the worst option on the sanitation ladder] is a common situation in the communities in your&#13;
   district? And do you agree that this [point to best option on the sanitation ladder] would be a&#13;
   desirable future situation?&#13;
5. On this basis, help the groups to develop a goal statement for their district-level Action Plan. This&#13;
   goal statement should not be more than two lines, and should summarize the rationale for preparing&#13;
   an Action Plan.&#13;
6. Ask each group to read out its goal to the participants. Note down the goals on a chart and facilitate&#13;
   a discussion on the goals:&#13;
   â&#150;    Similarities and differences in the goals suggested by the groups.&#13;
   â&#150;    How realistic are the goals?&#13;
   â&#150;    Can they be combined into a common goal for a district-level Action Plan?&#13;
7. Request the groups to nominate one person to make a note of the goal statement that each group&#13;
   has decided.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      A goal that is too ambitious should be avoided as it may undermine the effectiveness of the plan.&#13;
      An example of an unrealistic goal is: â&#128;&#152;entire district to be made ODF by end of the monthâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
      Encourage participants to think through the implications of the goal in a logical manner by asking&#13;
      questions, such as:&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; How many GPs are there in the district?&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; How many GPs are ODF?&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; How much time would it take to move toward ODF status in one block?&#13;
      In this way, help participants to assess the feasibility of the goal that they have decided.&#13;
â&#150;      Given that participants come from different backgrounds, they may or may not relate to a goal at the&#13;
      district level. Help the participants to see that the same goal filters through the different levels of&#13;
      organization i.e., ODF status is achievable at district level only if it is first achieved at block level.&#13;
      Similarly, blocks can become ODF only if GPs and villages in that block first become ODF.&#13;
      Therefore, regardless of the level at which they are working, the efforts are toward the same goal.&#13;
â&#150;      Once participants have undertaken the action planning exercise, they may wish to focus the goal&#13;
      further. In the beginning, it is important to have a reasonable goal which can provide a point of&#13;
      reference for the rationale behind developing an Action Plan.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
Shared understanding of the rationale for developing an Action Plan and see how efforts at different&#13;
levels (district, block or GP) contribute toward achieving the same goal.&#13;

Unit 9.3 Activities to Achieve the Goal&#13;
&#13;
Objectives                Participants decide what activities need to be undertaken to achieve the goal&#13;
Time                      1â&#128;&#147;1 Â½ hours&#13;
Method                    Brainstorming in groups&#13;
Materials                 Sheet, adhesive spray, paper cards, flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. Tell the groups,&#13;
   We now need to work out what needs to be done to change our present situation. How are we going&#13;
   to reach our goal? What activities do we need to undertake? If groups are hesitant to start, begin&#13;
   with an example of your own.&#13;
2. Give each group a set of paper cards. Ask participants to continue the brainstorming in their groups&#13;
   on the main activities needed to achieve the goal of their Action Plans. Encourage groups to think of&#13;
   implementation as a sequence of activities needed to move from OD to ODF status â&#128;&#147; what is the&#13;
   first step that you will take? And the second step? and so on. Groups can use as many paper cards&#13;
   as they like and they should aim to finish the group discussion in about 30 minutes.&#13;
3. While the participants are brainstorming in groups, set up a sheet in the center of the room. Pin three&#13;
   labels on the sheet:&#13;
   â&#150;    Start-up activities.&#13;
   â&#150;    Implementation activities.&#13;
   â&#150;    Postimplementation activities.&#13;
4. Now, ask groups to nominate one person to read out the main activities that the group has decided.&#13;
   Classify the activities by main theme by placing the card under the appropriate label.&#13;
5. After each group has read out its activities, facilitate a group discussion on:&#13;
   â&#150;    Similarities and differences in the activities chosen by each group.&#13;
   â&#150;    Sequence of activities in each phase of implementation â&#128;&#147; start-up, middle and end.&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      Some groups may be better than others at developing an action plan. One group may find it easier to&#13;
      plan for selection of GPs, another for training of motivators and yet another for monitoring. Another&#13;
      may be able to look at all these issues together. There is no right or wrong way to plan.&#13;
      Remember the goal of this activity is to simplify the planning process so that it becomes&#13;
      manageable.&#13;
â&#150;      In planning, the process is as important as the outcome. Instead of focusing exclusively on the&#13;
      results of the group discussion, i.e., the list of activities prepared by each group, try to also focus on&#13;
      the process by which the group arrived at this list. What questions were asked? How were decisions&#13;
      arrived at? This is because the targets and outputs of the plan will get modified as and when&#13;
      participants begin to actually move from theory to practice. What is important at this stage is that&#13;
      participants gain a thorough understanding of the principles and strategy for planning.&#13;
â&#150;      Do not be too concerned if a group is not willing to make a plan to support all the changes it has&#13;
      identified as desirable in sanitation facilities and hygiene behaviors. At this stage, it is enough that&#13;
      the group is willing to introduce some of the changes and has thought through the sequence of&#13;
      activities needed to change the goal into reality. Once, smaller changes have been introduced&#13;
      successfully, it will motivate the group to plan for further changes. A smaller plan, which has buy-in&#13;
      from the group, is likely to be more successful than a grand plan which members are not&#13;
      convinced about.&#13;
â&#150;      Questions may have already come up as to who should have responsibility for implementing certain&#13;
      parts of the plan. The next unit, Allocating Responsibility, helps groups to assign responsibility for&#13;
      operationalizing different tasks.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
Participants plan the action steps and sequence for implementing these to achieve the solutions it has&#13;
decided upon.&#13;

Unit 9.4 Allocating Responsibilities and&#13;
Presentation of Action Plans&#13;
&#13;
Objectives             To help the group to:&#13;
                       â&#150;    Identify the steps it will take to implement the plan and who will take&#13;
                           responsibility to carrying these out.&#13;
                       â&#150;    Set a time frame for implementing the plan.&#13;
Time                   1â&#128;&#147;1 Â½ hours&#13;
Method                 Brainstorming in groups&#13;
Materials              Sheet with activities agreed on the previous session, flip charts, markers&#13;
&#13;
Process&#13;
1. This unit builds on the discussion in the previous unit. Therefore, it would be useful to start with a&#13;
   recap to summarize the key points of the discussions thus far.&#13;
2. Give each group a chart with the following table. Explain the task to the group with the following words:&#13;
   This sheet [point to sheet with activities pinned on wall] shows the steps that you decided are&#13;
   needed to put your plan into action. Now, as a group, you need to work out the arrangement of&#13;
   activities that you will undertake in your block and then decide who will carry out each of these steps.&#13;
&#13;
     Discuss each step and the personal qualities, skills or appropriate administrative authority&#13;
     (district/block/GP/village) needed to carry each out. When you have decided who will be responsible for&#13;
     each step, write the names next to the activity on the chart given to you.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Name of Block &amp; District:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Name of Team Leader:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     No.    Activity        Who is            Time Frame           Financing           Monitoring        Problems and&#13;
                            Responsible?      Start End                                                  How to Solve Them&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. When the group has allocated responsibility for all the tasks, ask them to discuss and agree to&#13;
   nominate one member as a team leader who will coordinate all the activities. Write the name of the&#13;
   team leader on the chart under the name of the block/district.&#13;
4. Invite the selected team leaders to coordinate the rest of the meeting, including developing a&#13;
   timeline for achieving the activities identified in the groupsâ&#128;&#153; plans.&#13;
5. Request the group to discuss and agree on the amount of time needed to complete each activity.&#13;
   Record this information under start date and end date on the charts.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Give each group 30-45 minutes to complete its action plan and then ask each group to explain its&#13;
   plan to the participants. Each group should be prepared to answer any specific questions that might&#13;
   arise, although a more general discussion or debate should be limited until each group has had a&#13;
   chance to present its work.&#13;
7. After the presentations, encourage a discussion on:&#13;
   â&#150;    Similarities and differences in the action plans developed by each group.&#13;
   â&#150;    What resources they might need.&#13;
   â&#150;    How much time is needed to complete different activities?&#13;
   â&#150;    How can the group check that people are doing what they are responsible for and on time?&#13;
   â&#150;    What problems may arise and what can be done to solve them: (a) by the group; and/or (b) by&#13;
       taking the help of outsiders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Notes&#13;
â&#150;      This session encourages participants to take responsibility for driving the sanitation program&#13;
      forward. This is a departure from the traditional top-down and target-driven approach that participants&#13;
      may be more familiar with. Encourage them to use their local knowledge of their blocks, and make&#13;
      them aware that no one knows the ground situation the way that they do. Therefore, they are best&#13;
      placed to suggest how this program can be implemented within the targets that they have&#13;
      to achieve.&#13;
â&#150;      Encourage group members to take responsibility for different tasks in the Action Plan instead of&#13;
      nominating others or people who have not attended the ToT. It is possible that while allocating&#13;
      responsibility, groups may add more steps to their action plan. Once the group realizes that it is&#13;
      going to have to take responsibility for driving implementation of the plan, they will start to&#13;
      think more carefully about what resources and capabilities it might take to undertake the&#13;
      same.&#13;
â&#150;      If a group is reluctant to accept responsibility itself and allocates most of its tasks to outsiders, e.g.,&#13;
      by hiring consultants or NGOs, it will need to consider:&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Why it is not prepared to assume responsibility itself for the activities outlined in the plan?&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Whether it really believes that sanitation or hygiene are problems and, if so, whether its efforts&#13;
           will help to overcome these problems in the communities where the members are working?&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Why representatives of these external groups (e.g. consultants, NGOs) have not been included&#13;
           as participants in the ToT?&#13;
      â&#128;&#147; Whether these external representatives would be committed to carrying out a plan developed by&#13;
           the group?&#13;
â&#150;      If the group does not believe in the importance of sanitation or in its own capacity to make a&#13;
      difference to the situation, this could be the key reason why it does not support the plan. In which&#13;
      case, the facilitator might need to reiterate key messages or find other ways for the group to&#13;
      discover information. Another strategy could be to compare this groupâ&#128;&#153;s position with that of other&#13;
      groups and encourage the latter to convince the odd one out.&#13;
â&#150;      There is no â&#128;&#152;bestâ&#128;&#153; way for the group to allocate tasks but administrative protocol must be kept in&#13;
      mind instead of basing decisions on popularity of an individual. In addition, those selected should&#13;
      also be asked if they think they are the right persons for the task.&#13;
&#13;
Learning Outcome&#13;
Action Plans developed by participants for scaling up total sanitation in the district.&#13;

&#13;
               This would be a good time to request participants to fill up the Self-Assessment&#13;
               Questionnaire for the second time to gauge the shift in perspective and learning pre- and&#13;
               post-training. This takes about 30 minutes.&#13;

1. Request all participants to assemble where training objectives and expectations have been pinned&#13;
   up. Alternatively, move the chart to a place where it is visible to all participants.&#13;
2. Now, revisit each objective in turn and then the expectations by category and ask the participants to&#13;
   share their views on whether the training program has succeeded in meeting their expectations and&#13;
   what can be done better next time.&#13;
3. Next, distribute the Workshop Evaluation Form (given as Attachment 11) and request participants for&#13;
   feedback on how the training program can better address their needs.&#13;
4. To gauge the learning outcomes, distribute the Self-assessment Form once again, as was done on&#13;
   Day 1 of the workshop, and request participants to fill the same.&#13;
5. Sincerely thank participants for the time and effort that they have contributed toward attending the&#13;
   workshop. Also, acknowledge the effort of all the people who have contributed to organizing different&#13;
   aspects of the training program.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This Training Manual is to be used by
            resource agencies engaged in training potential master
            trainers to facilitate and scale up community-driven total
            sanitation. It comprises three interlinked modules, the
            details of which are as follows: Guidance Notes (Volume 1)
            facilitates understanding of key concepts of
            community-driven total sanitation. There are nine Guidance
            Notes covering topics such as facilitating participatory
            training, principles and practices of community-driven total
            sanitation, sanitation technologies, hygiene practices, and
            monitoring.  Trainers&#146; Notes (Volume 2) provides curricula
            and guidance to trainers on how to facilitate a five-day
            Training of Trainers&#146; Program on community-driven total
            sanitation. It includes session plans, training resources,
            (e.g., handouts, presentations), and Trainer&#146;s tips. The
            third module, Reference Materials, is available on a CD or online.
