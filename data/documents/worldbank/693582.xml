Mitigating Risks in Power Reform-&#13;
A New World Bank Lending Approach&#13;
Power sector reform in the Indian state of Haryana&#13;
Djamil .llostL'azi   The World Bank has agreed to support power sector reforms in Haryana with a new type of lending&#13;
instrument-the adaptable program loan-recently approved by its board of directors. Under this&#13;
approach, being applied for the first time, the Bank will provide a series of loans totaling US$600&#13;
million over eight to ten years, but will commit the loans only when the state government has&#13;
reached agreed milestones. This approach allows the state government milestones-not the&#13;
covenants of standard World Bank loans-to determine the timing of controversial actions. The&#13;
flexibility is intended to improve the reform program's chances of success and avoid the stop-start&#13;
lending pattern that has characterized the Bank's past lending to state electricity boards. This&#13;
Note explains Haryana's reform strategy and how the adaptable program loan applies. Haryana's&#13;
reform could have an important demonstration effect.&#13;

risk: its initial financial commitment is limited,&#13;

the completion of concrete reform steps. But&#13;
once each loan is committed, the funds will&#13;
normally remain available for disbursement&#13;
unless there is a clear indication that the re-&#13;

continuous beach of basic covenants. A slow-&#13;
down in reform would defer the next loan, but&#13;
support to investments initiated under preced-&#13;

continuing support to Haryana during times of&#13;
difficulty in implementing reform, even if ad-&#13;

            Mitigating risks in power reform - a new
            World Bank lending approach : power sector reform in the
            Indian state of Haryana
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The World Bank has agreed to support
            power sector reforms in Haryana with a new type of lending
            instrument--the adaptable program loan--recently approved by
            its board of directors.  Under this approach, being applied
            for the first time, the Bank will provide a series of loans
            totaling US$600 million over eight to ten years, but will
            commit the loans only when the state government has reached
            agreed milestones.  This approach allows the state
            government milestones--not the covenants of standard World
            Bank loans --to determine the timing of controversial
            actions.  The flexibility is intended to improve the reform
            program's chances of success and avoid the stop-start
            lending pattern that has characterized the Bank's past
            lending to state electricity boards.  This Note explains
            Haryana's reform strategy and how the adaptable program
            loan applies.  Haryana's reform could have an important
            demonstration effect.
