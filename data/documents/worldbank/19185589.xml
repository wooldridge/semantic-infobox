&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors&#13;
of 16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success&#13;
factorsâ&#128;&#153; selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this&#13;
prompted countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put&#13;
them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the&#13;
African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Strategic Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mozambique has made enormous strides in the water supply       efforts. The target for rural water is unlikely to be met&#13;
sector in the past two decades. The sector has separated       unless significant new investments appear, and long-term&#13;
water resources and water production roles from water          functionality rates improve. Nonetheless, the Millennium&#13;
supply asset holding and from water services management.       Development Goalsâ&#128;&#153; (MDG) target for water supply overall&#13;
It has also created a regulatory structure and body that has   might be met, based upon strong urban progress. In&#13;
struck a balance between government and private-sector         sanitation, it is highly unlikely that the MDG target will&#13;
management while giving increasing voice to consumers.         be met. Leadership on sanitation has been fragmented,&#13;
The reform process continues today, with expected              financing levels have been inadequate, and approaches&#13;
modifications at decentralized levels of governance.           to sanitation and hygiene promotion have not kept pace&#13;
                                                               with best practice.&#13;
After more than a decade emphasizing service expansion,&#13;
service sustainability needs attention. The urban water        During the last decade, funding levels and disbursement&#13;
delegated management frameworkâ&#128;&#153;s greatest challenge            amounts have steadily climbed, and outputs have&#13;
lies in maintaining operational cost recovery and making       consequently doubled or tripled. While Official Development&#13;
steady progress on capital cost recovery. The challenge        Assistance still makes up the majority of sector financing,&#13;
for rural water supply lies not simply in expanding access,    donor confidence in Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s capabilities is reflected&#13;
but in ensuring sustainable services. Progress in urban and    in growing investment portfolios and increasing amounts&#13;
rural sanitation has stagnated, and updated approaches         of program support. Nonetheless, donor and government&#13;
to service delivery are urgently needed. Sector information    efficiency in the use of funds must increase. Urban&#13;
management systems and human resource development              water supply has generated sufficient funding through&#13;
have not kept pace with institutional expansion, resulting     to 2015, while it is doubtful that any of the other three&#13;
in a potential drag on long-term planning, financing, and      subsectors will obtain the funding needed to reach the&#13;
implementation.                                                national coverage targets. The model developed for urban&#13;
                                                               water supply has itself been instrumental in generating&#13;
The national targets for urban water supply will very likely   investment, while the other subsectors have failed to&#13;
be achieved, thanks to massive investments and intensive       create viable models that investors find attractive.&#13;
reform efforts. Rural water services, despite many key&#13;
reforms, remain fragile, not having progressed much            This second African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW)&#13;

Investment levels remain low, while water point                collaboration with the Government of Mozambique and&#13;
rehabilitation consumes an excessive share of subsector        other stakeholders.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   An immediate updated assessment of sector needs in human resources, leading to the development of a comprehensive&#13;
       plan for building capacity at all levels (national, provincial, municipal/utility, district, and community), and within all&#13;
       strata (decision makers, managers, technicians, and users) in the private and public spheres.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Improved financial information management, including consolidated annual data collection and reporting,&#13;
       expenditure tracking, and attempts to reduce funding gaps by introducing greater equity in resource allocation.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Intensified attempts at donor coordination and increasing programmatic support.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Increased and permanent support for the National Sector Information Management System (SINAS), including regular&#13;
       performance monitoring with targeted integration into government planning systems, and public dissemination.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Coming to terms with the significant disparity between official access figures produced by the National Directorate&#13;
       of Water (DNA) and the National Institute of Statistics (INE), and the potentially significant implications that this&#13;
       harmonization may demand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Fast-track implementation of the new national program, PRONASAR and its associated common fund.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   The establishment of institutional arrangements and mechanisms to ensure the sustainability of community-managed&#13;
       rural water supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Support for the development of the domestic private sector to operate urban water supply systems.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Improved operational efficiency in system management (reducing nonrevenue water, improving tariff collections,&#13;
       addressing over-staffing, and so on), and meeting capital cost recovery targets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Immediate prioritization of sanitation through the adoption at scale of total sanitation and sanitation marketing&#13;
       approaches for rural areas, and the strengthening of private and public sector capacities to participate successfully in&#13;
       these approaches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Immediate prioritization of sanitation through the adoption at scale of low-cost sanitation marketing approaches&#13;
       for peri-urban areas, and the strengthening of public and private sector capacities to participate successfully in these&#13;
       approaches.&#13;

&#13;
1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation, and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 The AMCOW delegated&#13;
this task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank which are implementing&#13;
it in close partnership with UNICEF and the WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced&#13;
in collaboration with the Government of Mozambique and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but also what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated&#13;
coverage in water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation.&#13;
A synthesis report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

    Coverage and Finance Trends&#13;
&#13;
Coverage: Assessing Past Progress                              supply (both urban and rural) and 60 percent for sanitation&#13;
                                                               (50 percent rural; 80 percent urban) appear slightly above&#13;
The access figures from the National Directorate for Water     projected coverage in 2015, if progress continues at the&#13;
Affairs (DNA) for 2008 are 51 percent for water supply and     same rate (Figure 1).&#13;
44 percent for sanitation.3 Disaggregating by population&#13;
segments, the DNA access figures are 52 percent for rural      According to Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) data&#13;
and 50 percent for urban water supply. For sanitation the      (based on official government statistics produced by&#13;
disaggregated access figures are 40 percent for rural and      INE, the National Institute of Statistics, using household&#13;
55 percent for urban. The rural water supply figures are       surveys)4 approximately 47 percent of the population&#13;
generated by DNA in concert with local governments based       enjoys access to improved water supplies, while 17 percent&#13;
upon the previous yearâ&#128;&#153;s coverage plus an approximation        has access to improved sanitation. JMP/INE estimates for&#13;
of the number of people served by the number of new            rural and urban water supply in 2008 are 29 percent and&#13;
water points and piped systems installed during the year,      77 percent, respectively. For sanitation JMP/INE estimate&#13;

The discrepancy in coverage estimates for urban water                        The CSO2 provides an estimate of annual investment&#13;
supply access figures is the result of (a) JMP reporting                     requirements to meet the national targets, based on DNA&#13;
access for families that get their water from piped                          coverage data and other inputs such as technology mix, unit&#13;
systems, though these piped systems are privately owned                      costs, and technology lifespan. Investment requirements&#13;

3.	 Reform Context:&#13;
	 Introducing the CSO2 Scorecard&#13;
&#13;
Mozambique won independence in 1975. However, the                supply provision model being most developed, rural&#13;
internal conflict of 1982â&#128;&#147;92 led to significant infrastructure   water and sanitation less developed, and urban sanitation&#13;
failure and destruction, despite early efforts, especially in    least developed.&#13;
the area of sanitation, to bring improved services to the&#13;
population. Modern reform takes off with the signing of          This recent history puts the service delivery pathway in&#13;
the 1992 peace accords. The first milestone is approval of       context, which can then be explored in detail using the&#13;
the National Water Policy in 1995 which introduced key           CSO2 scorecard, an assessment tool providing a snapshot&#13;
reform elements such as reduced direct implementation by         of reform progress. The CSO2 scorecard assesses the&#13;
government, increased private sector roles, recognition of       building blocks of service delivery in turn: three building&#13;
water and sanitation services as both social and economic        blocks which relate to enabling services, three which relate&#13;
goods, and the application of the demand-responsive              to developing new services, and three which relate to&#13;
approach to service provision, especially for rural areas.       sustaining services. Each building block is assessed against&#13;
These principles continue to shape the sector today, and         specific indicators and scored from 1 to 3 accordingly.8&#13;

This first wave of reform was closely followed by a&#13;

The decentralization process is being complemented by&#13;
the planned creation of Provincial Water and Sanitation&#13;
Services (SPAS) and the establishment of a common fund&#13;
for rural water supply and sanitation, both of which are&#13;
aimed at driving decision making and investments to the&#13;
lowest levels possible.&#13;
&#13;
Over 85 percent of available public investment funding for&#13;
the sector still comes from grants or concessional loans,7&#13;
which until now have tended to centralize investment                          Sustaining                      Developing&#13;

 For rural sanitation, the disparity between national                  the DNA data: an estimated US$40 million per year in&#13;
 estimates of coverage from the DNA and those from the                 CAPEX is required to meet the national sector target.22&#13;
 JMP (derived from INE household survey data, including                Anticipated public investments are only expected to&#13;
 the 2008 MICS survey)21 is stark. The former portray a                provide US$3 million per year, potentially leveraging the&#13;
 steady increase in coverage from 5 percent in 1990 to                 same in household contributions if a subsidy policy of&#13;
 40 percent by 2009, suggesting the subsector target of                50 percent of total costs is effective. If the INE estimates&#13;
 50 percent will be achieved if past rates of progress are             of coverage are correct, there appears to be little hope&#13;
 sustained. JMP/INE estimates, on the other hand, show                 of making even modest progress. The true extent of the&#13;
 coverage flatlining at very low levels of around 4 percent,           challenge cannot be conclusively tracked until improved&#13;
 with an additional 1 percent sharing facilities (not counted          methodologies for monitoring sanitation access can be&#13;

                 approaches for peri-urban areas, and the strengthening of public and private sector capacities to participate&#13;

 rural sanitation. Both the DNA trend line (an increase                comparable to that for rural sanitation. Anticipated public&#13;
 from 40 percent in 1990 to 55 percent in 2009), and the               investment of US$33 million per year (assuming near-term&#13;
 INE estimates (largely flat; reaching 38 percent in 2008)             forecasts continue) will, at most, leverage a further US$20&#13;
 suggest that a huge increase in coverage would be required            million per year from households on the basis of their&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Mozambique :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Mozambique has made enormous strides in
            the water supply sector in the past two decades. The sector
            has separated water resources and water production roles
            from water supply asset holding and from water services
            management. It has also created a regulatory structure and
            body that has struck a balance between government and
            private-sector management while giving increasing voice to
            consumers. The reform process continues today, with expected
            modifications at decentralized levels of governance. After
            more than a decade emphasizing service expansion, service
            sustainability needs attention. The urban water delegated
            management framework's greatest challenge lies in
            maintaining operational cost recovery and making steady
            progress on capital cost recovery. The challenge for rural
            water supply lies not simply in expanding access, but in
            ensuring sustainable services. Progress in urban and rural
            sanitation has stagnated, and updated approaches to service
            delivery are urgently needed. Sector information management
            systems and human resource development have not kept pace
            with institutional expansion, resulting in a potential drag
            on long-term planning, financing, and implementation.
