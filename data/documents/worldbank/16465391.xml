&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CONSOLIDATING AND ACCELERAT ING EXPORTS IN BANGLADESH&#13;

&#13;
                                                Overview&#13;
&#13;
1. For Bangladesh to become a middle-income                    this threshold, a countryâ&#128;&#153;s export basket shows a&#13;
country, growth in exports needs to accelerate.                relatively diversified mix of basic-and-higher-&#13;
Exports of basic garments will continue to be                  value garments. This is because the&#13;
important in the near future, but Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s                 increasing pressure on wages and benefits&#13;
competitive advantage in this area could erode                 erodes competitiveness in basic garments. As&#13;
over time. As such, looking ahead, accelerating                such, as shown in Figure 0.2, empirical&#13;
exports will require not only consolidating                    evidence suggests that growth in per capita&#13;
existing strengths in basic garments but                       garment exports is sustained by moving away&#13;
diversifying gradually into other products such as             from basic garments; as a corollary, the decline&#13;
higher value garment and service exports.                      in per capita basic garments exports (point A)&#13;
Forward-looking policymaking requires that                     must occur before the overall decline in per&#13;
measures be put in place now to encourage such                 capita garment exports (point B).&#13;
diversification in future, while building on existing&#13;
strengths. How can Bangladesh make this                        3. By this reasoning, there is room for the&#13;
happen? Available research shows that the                      garment sector in Bangladesh to grow and&#13;
infrastructure deficit, especially energy, as well             capture an increasing share of the world&#13;
as lack of appropriate skills and the weak                     market. Exports as a share of GDP were 15&#13;
regulatory environment continue to hinder                      percent on average in the past decade, of which&#13;
exports from Bangladesh. These weaknesses still                garment exports accounted for around 76 percent.&#13;
persist. To complement work done so far, this                  Meanwhile, Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s share in world garment&#13;
report focuses on the role of trade logistics, skills          exports has edged up, with an increase in market&#13;
and compliance with labor standards in                         share from 2.6 percent to 4.3 percent over 2000-&#13;
consolidating existing strengths and moving to                 09. Figure 0.1 shows the steep trajectory of&#13;
higher value products, using the garment sector as             Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s success in garments â&#128;&#147; with its per&#13;
a lens. In addition, given the growing importance              capita GDP of US$482 (in constant 2000 US$)&#13;
of services in world trade, the report also                    well below the threshold â&#128;&#147; can be sustained for a&#13;
examines prospects for diversifying into a â&#128;&#156;reach              while. However, as per capita income grows and&#13;
sectorâ&#128;? such as IT-enabled services that can                   reaches closer to the threshold level, Bangladesh&#13;
provide high-quality jobs.                                     will lose its competitive edge to other countries&#13;
                                                               with lower wages, first in basic, and later in&#13;
2. Evidence from garment-exporting countries                   higher value garments. Therefore, to ensure&#13;
suggests that there is a â&#128;&#156;thresholdâ&#128;? level of per              continued overall export growth, Bangladesh&#13;
capita GDP, after which per-capita garment                     would need more contributions from other&#13;
exports begin to decline (Figure 0.1). For                     sectors even before reaching the threshold per&#13;
instance, real per capita exports of garments in               capita income. But to do this, apart from&#13;
Thailand grew until it reached a â&#128;&#156;thresholdâ&#128;? per               dealing with the usual constraints to business,&#13;
capita GDP of about US$2,000 (in constant 2000                 Bangladesh needs to focus on improving its trade&#13;
US$), about US$1,000 in the Philippines, and                   logistics, skills, and compliance with labor&#13;
around US$1,150 in Sri Lanka. Before reaching                  standards.&#13;

    Earlier, the GSP favored knitwear, which was more likely to meet the required local content. Domestic value&#13;
    addition in knitwear is about 75 percent because of the backward linkage to spinning factories. Local factories&#13;
    supply about 90 percent of the total fabric required. In the immediate past, only about 16 percent of the woven&#13;
    exports to EU qualified for the GSP facility because imported fabric typically accounts for 60 percent of the&#13;
    output price. So far, the EU is the major importer of Bangladesh knitwear accounting for about 75 percent of&#13;
    the total value versus about 16 percent for the US.&#13;

                                Box 1.1: Industria de Diseno Textil ( Zara)&#13;
   Zara, along with H&amp;M, Benetton and Gap are pioneers in the â&#128;&#156;fast fashionâ&#128;? business model based on&#13;
   spotting trends rather than creating them. It also requires short development cycles, rapid prototyping and&#13;
   small order sizes and thus a highly responsive to supply chain. Originally relying on its manufacturing base&#13;
   in Spain, Zara has gradually expanded its overseas production.&#13;
&#13;
   Zara currently orders about 80 million units from Bangladeshi manufacturers. The garments are primarily&#13;
   basic knitwear, which minimizes the order cycle time. At present it does not contract for twill or denim but&#13;
   this may change as local production improves. Zara is more demanding in terms of logistics than other&#13;
   fashion retailers. It relies heavily on airfreight to move goods from its suppliers to its global distribution&#13;
   centers in Spain. In the case of Bangladesh, about half the orders are shipped by air.&#13;
&#13;
   Zara multi-sources each style, with initial deliveries being received from factories that have fabric available&#13;
   and can deliver most rapidly. Slower suppliers are blended in as demand for the style increases. Orders are&#13;
   placed in terms of weekly output rather than total orders with production continuing as long as there is&#13;
   sufficient demand. Since styles change frequentlyâ&#128;&#148;about 12-16 collections per yearâ&#128;&#148;suppliers have to be&#13;
   adept at setting up new production.&#13;

average growth rates of garments and overall                     developing countries can be attributed to&#13;

       Growth of exports has been analyzed in terms of â&#128;&#152;intensive marginsâ&#128;&#153;, i.e., continued growth in existing&#13;
       products, versus â&#128;&#152;extensive marginsâ&#128;&#153;, ie, growth via diversification into new products. Brenton and Newfarmer&#13;
       (2007) found that about 80 percent of export growth of developing countries during 1995-2004 can be explained&#13;
       by intensive margins. Amiti and Freund (2008) conclude the same by analyzing growth of Chinese exports&#13;
       during 1992-2007. Helpman, Melitz, and Rubenstein (2008) also found a similar result in their study.&#13;
       Nonetheless, this literature does not seem to be conclusiveâ&#128;&#148;for example, Hummels and Klenow (2005), and&#13;
       Kang (2004) found that extensive margins played a more significant role in the growth of exports, the former in&#13;
       a multi-country study, and the latter studying Chinese, Taiwanese and South Korean exports.&#13;

1.26 Further into the future, Bangladesh will                  As its per capita income grows and it reaches&#13;
also reach the overall threshold (point B).                    closer to point B, other countries with lower wage&#13;
Wellbefore reaching this point, Bangladesh should              and per capita income levels will become&#13;

     In the case of Bangladesh, energy costs are also highly subsidized, which is an additional factor in the&#13;
     competitiveness of the garments industry. On the other hand, the shortage of gas means that most if not all&#13;
     firms have a significant backup of more expensive, own-generated electricity. Thus, possible re-pricing of&#13;
     energy costs (if accompanied by more reliable and adequate grid supply) to reflect actual costs could have a&#13;
     mixed impact on the garments sector.&#13;
11&#13;
     Of course, the threshold for Bangladesh can vary depending on the world economic environment, but&#13;
     international experience tells us that the threshold is some time away.&#13;

     We did not distinguish between EPZ and non-EPZ environment in our analysis. Exports are mostly driven by&#13;
     non-EPZ firms (more than 80%) in Bangladesh which are more exposed to logistics, skill and compliance&#13;
     constraints. Therefore, our overall policy suggestions remain valid despite some differences between the EPZ&#13;
     and non-EPZ environment. However, while an in-depth comparative analysis of the performance of EPZ and&#13;
     non-EPZ firms will be valuable, it is beyond the scope of this study.&#13;

2.20 Use of airfreight by garment exporters is             industry when requested by the buyer or when&#13;
growing, but is capacity constrained. The                  production delays resulted in a missed shipment&#13;
principal gateway for airfreight is Dhakaâ&#128;&#153;s                date. The buyerâ&#128;&#153;s request generally involves&#13;
Shahjalal International Airport. Airfreight is             higher value garments and has been very&#13;
shipped on a combination of scheduled and                  significant recently. The use of airfreight for&#13;
chartered air freighters as well as in the belly of        missed shipments is also increasing owing to&#13;
passenger aircraft.      Currently there are 9             energy shortages. Lack of physical capacity has&#13;

3.1 Shortage of skilled workers is one of the             on basic garments. According to a survey of&#13;
oft-cited constraints to industrialization and            about 80,000 workers in 242 garment firms in&#13;
export growth in Bangladesh. This chapter                 1995, about 48 percent of the workers were either&#13;
analyses the skill shortage in Bangladesh,                unskilled or semi-skilled, 44 percent were skilled&#13;
especially in the garment sector, based on                and only 8 percent were highly skilled. Also,&#13;
available information. Owing to lack of reliable          while 34 percent of female workers were&#13;
and up-to-date data, the chapter is careful in            unskilled, only 9 percent of male workers were&#13;
drawing its conclusions. This gap in data also            unskilled. Table 3.1 shows 67 percent of the&#13;
highlights the urgent need for an in-depth survey-        sewing and finishing helpers were unskilled, while&#13;
based assessment of Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s skill gaps.              27 percent were semi-skilled. Most workers&#13;
                                                          working as cutting helpers, iron and folding men&#13;
3.2 Key messages. Despite the reported shortages          were semi-skilled while machine operators were&#13;
of skilled labor, there are few incentives for the        skilled. And 49 percent of the cutting&#13;
private sector to impart training. This is because        masters/cutters, supervisors and quality controllers&#13;
workers change jobs frequently after being trained        were skilled while 47 percent were highly skilled.&#13;
and therefore it is not in the firmsâ&#128;&#153; interest to&#13;
spend resources on training them. In addition,            3.5 No subsequent comparable survey exists,&#13;
since the garment workers come from poor                  but indirect evidence suggests that the share of&#13;
households, they are unable to pay for training           unskilled and semi-skilled workers would still&#13;

3.3 Hard evidence on the skill mix and gap is             period was 25 percent and 11.4 percent&#13;
difficult to come by. There is a 1995 survey of           respectively, implying that their unit price&#13;

anything because of the weak enforcement of                 in-house training facilities and even what they&#13;
contracts. One local manufacturer reported that             have is self-rated as poor due to lack of&#13;
only 25 percent of the operators could be retained          professional trainers and training equipment&#13;
&#13;

     A survey of an admittedly limited number of 87 workers from 41 garment factories conducted in 2007 shows&#13;
     that little over half of the workers had completed secondary education and only less than 10 percent had gone&#13;
     beyond grade ten. About one-third of the workers had only studied up to the primary level. The sample was&#13;
     drawn on the basis of proportional distribution of types of factories in the population. See&#13;

               Box 3.1: Education and Industry Trajectories: Bangladesh and Sri Lanka&#13;
     Sri Lanka provides free access to education, all the way to tertiary education. This is reflected in&#13;
     its literacy rate of 91 percent in 2009. In Bangladesh, primary education is free, but access was an&#13;
     issue, and quality of education remains a major concern. All this is reflected in Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     literacy rate of 54 percent. It became clear from interviews with Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi&#13;
     garment firms that while the former could recruit from a pool of high school graduates, the latterâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     choice was restricted to only primary school graduates and high school dropouts. This difference&#13;
     in initial human capital had major implications for the agility and trainability of the workers in the&#13;
     two countries, which in turn resulted in the industries taking very different paths. Sri Lanka was&#13;
     able to take the high value-low volume path, while Bangladesh was largely competitive in the low&#13;
     value-high volume path. These different trajectories are illustrated in the top five garment exports&#13;
     of these two countries below. Thus, Sri Lankaâ&#128;&#153;s top export is rather expensive lingerie whereas for&#13;
     Bangladesh it is male knit cotton shirts.&#13;

3.19 Due to lack of employersâ&#128;&#153; confidence in the             mentioned before, private inability to payfor&#13;

unemployment amongst TVET graduates                          To address this problem, government can think of&#13;
coexist. A survey of 2302 TVET graduates found               providing â&#128;&#156;training vouchersâ&#128;? to interested&#13;
about 47 percent of them unemployed in 2005                  trainees to finance part of their training cost. Of&#13;

graduation. Over 60 percent of the respondents               them, with the students leaving the program&#13;
identified the failure of the TVET system to align           incomplete. Addressing this will put the onus on&#13;
training materials with local needs and                      governmentâ&#128;&#153;s monitoring and auditing ability.&#13;
opportunities as the main reason for their difficulty        One way to check the moral hazard problem will&#13;

Therefore, it is highly likely that small employers        topped up with government funding, at least until&#13;

product development skills, and reduction of lead            abroad but has opened marketing offices in New&#13;
times. Third, at the firm level, the focus was on            York and London to improve its links with buyers.&#13;
reduction of manufacturing costs, upgrading of               MAS and Brandix have also developed a range of&#13;

avoid sourcing from non-compliant countries.               female workers.&#13;
This can affect the growth potential of the sector.&#13;
As seen in 2005, notable compliance failures in            4.4 In addition, the government updated and&#13;
one or more factories46 can jeopardize prospects of        consolidated the old labor laws into one to&#13;

has become proactive since 2006 in improving               enacted in 2006, eliminated inconsistencies in&#13;

However, strengthening the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s capacity&#13;
to monitor and enforce this code is important.             Compliance with labor standards is becoming&#13;
                                                           more important in the garments sector&#13;

                      Box 4.1: Garments Without Guilt: Sri Lankaâ&#128;&#153;s Business Strategy&#13;
       Following the phasing out of the Multi Fiber Arrangement (MFA), Sri Lankaâ&#128;&#153;s Joint Apparel&#13;
       Association Forum (JAAF) adopted the â&#128;&#156;Garments without Guiltâ&#128;? initiative as a business strategy&#13;
       to face new global competition. This initiative was expected to give the country a competitive&#13;
       edge as an ethical producer in a crowded international market. The codes of garments without&#13;
       guilt were developed after consultation with different stakeholders and include:&#13;
           Â·   Free of Child labor&#13;
           Â·   Free of Forced labor&#13;
           Â·   Free of Discrimination&#13;
           Â·   Free of Sweatshop Practices including:&#13;
                            Providing limits on working hours within those prescribed in law&#13;
                            Guaranteeing workers the right to Freedom of Association&#13;
                            Requiring that workers receive all legally required pay and benefits&#13;
                            Ensuring that the workplace is safe, with specific requirement for the&#13;
                            management of the workplace&#13;
       The country has signed up an international auditing company SGS to certify that factories comply&#13;
       with these codes. Because of this initiative, Sri Lanka today is identified as a low risk sourcing&#13;
       destination when it comes to ethical trading practices. It has helped Sri Lanka not only to&#13;
       withstand the post-MFA competition but also to carve out and consolidate a niche among high-&#13;
       end clients in casual wear, intimate apparel, active and sportswear, and childrenâ&#128;&#153;s wear. The&#13;
       country supplies garments to many well-known and prestigious brands such as Gap, Nike,&#13;
       Victoriaâ&#128;&#153;s Secret, Next, Liz Claiborne, Tommy Hilfiger, Triumph, Marks &amp; Spencer, and Speedo.&#13;
       It has become the foremost supplier of world renowned intimate apparel to the world, which has&#13;
       made it the Lingerie Capital of the World.&#13;

the workers. In addition, limited scope for bridge         as well. Given that some of the most significant&#13;
finance through short-term loans from banks                competition for Bangladeshi garment firms comes&#13;
increases the severity of these problems.                  from within the country rather than abroad, firmsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
                                                           incentives dictate delaying compliance until they&#13;

poor compliance. In the early phase of growth of           This puts the onus on government agencies for&#13;
the sector, many garment firms were set up in              ensuring that all firms comply with the law, and&#13;

cannot comply with industrial building codes.              another.&#13;
Moreover, the overall enforcement of the labor&#13;
law and building code is still very low. The               Policy recommendations&#13;
Government has established a compliance&#13;
monitoring cell within the Export Promotion                4.18 Increase enforcement of law. Currently,&#13;

law by regularly monitoring factories. But it lacks        for an effective regulatory environment to&#13;
sufficient numbers of trained inspectors. In               improve the compliance situation. But because of&#13;
absence of any credible threat of consequences for         coordination failure, as well as other reasons cited&#13;

many firms becomes apathetic to compliance.                compliance, at least in the short run. Therefore,&#13;
                                                           government has to ensure the enforcement of&#13;
4.16 Another reason for manufacturersâ&#128;&#153; apathy              laws. Capacity of the compliance monitoring cell&#13;

&amp;#12;4.19 About 20 percent of the firms are engaged in          sector as a whole for two reasons. First, the five&#13;
subcontracting. Much of the labor unrest initially         year lag in adjustment of minimum wages may&#13;
starts in these firms, due to their poor compliance        make workers unhappy and lead to strikes and&#13;
situation, and then spreads over to other firms,           violence. An annual adjustment will reduce the&#13;

therefore remain outside the ambit of the                  annual adjustment results in a larger minimum&#13;
associationsâ&#128;&#153; inspections. Strengthening of                wage award, when that occurs. For example, the&#13;

      ITES-BPO industry is distinct from the IT industry. ITES-BPO can range from the simple (data entry, scanning&#13;

      sectors, the range of work is fairly limited and very technical. Some other terms used in this section are:&#13;

       Box 5.1: What do Indian ITES-BPO Firms Think of Bangladesh as a Potential Offshoring&#13;
                                        Destination?&#13;
     Indian companies have considered Kenya, Ghana, Mauritius and Nigeria as potential low-cost options for&#13;
     expansion. Why have they not looked at Bangladesh as a potential offshoring destination? Interviews with&#13;
     some Indian firms shed some light on this:&#13;
&#13;
     Â· Issues around perception of the country: The common perception among Indian firms was that the&#13;
       ITES-BPO industry does not really exist in Bangladesh. While the country is known for its excellent&#13;
       textile industry, and its cheap labor, it is not seen as a country with talent suited for â&#128;&#152;servicesâ&#128;&#153; industries.&#13;
     Â· Lack of promotion by Industry: While some of the local Indian companies had met with BASIS and&#13;
       some of the other industry representatives, most of the larger firms had not interacted with any&#13;
       Bangladesh-based ITES-BPO company, not even at major events such as the International Outsourcing&#13;
       Forum, nor the local events conducted by NASSCOM. This means that they were unaware of the&#13;
       availability of accounting talent, graphics capability, etc. in Bangladesh.&#13;
     Â· Lack of promotion by the Government: Senior executives from the Indian firms interviewed said&#13;
       governments of countries like Botswana and Kenya had reached out to them and offered different&#13;
       incentives for setting up operations in their countries. However, none of the Indian firms were ever&#13;
       contacted by the Government of Bangladesh or its representatives for attracting investment. This&#13;
       worries Indian firms since they are not sure whether the Government actually supports the growth of the&#13;
       industry.&#13;
     Â· Tedious procedures for talent movement: One of the key issues that have stopped Indian companies&#13;
       from investing in Bangladesh is the difficulty in obtaining a business visa. Also, repatriation of salaries,&#13;
       capital, dividends, and profits between the countries is not possible, thus reducing the incentive for talent&#13;
       to move across the border.&#13;
&#13;
     All the above issues withstanding, the conclusion of most of the interactions was also that while the firms&#13;
     had never evaluated Bangladesh as an option for expansion, they are quite open to carrying out some further&#13;
     interactions with their Bangladesh counterparts. The overall feeling was that if more information was made&#13;
     available regarding the opportunities, and some of the procedural issues ironed out, Bangladesh might be an&#13;
     interesting option to expand into. This is especially true of firms thinking of expanding into the Far East&#13;
     (Philippines, China) or Africa.&#13;

   The government of Egypt â&#128;&#147; via the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) and the Ministry of Communication&#13;
   and Information Technology (MCIT) â&#128;&#147; has launched a program, â&#128;&#152;the Education Development Program for&#13;
   Egyptian Universitiesâ&#128;&#153; (EDU Egypt), to increase the employability and industry readiness of the talent pool of&#13;
   the nation. This has been done to provide employment options to the youth â&#128;&#147; 330,000 of whom are graduating&#13;
   every year in Egypt. Of this roughly 5 percent graduate in engineering and a further 4 percent graduating in&#13;
   other scientific degrees, while 20 percent graduate in commerce.&#13;
&#13;
   EDU Egypt has been two pronged in its approach and focus towards upgrading the skills of the talent pool â&#128;&#147; one&#13;
   area of focus is the BPO industry and the other focuses on IT sector.&#13;
&#13;
   The BPO program is aimed at improving the soft skills (language skills, customer service, culture sensitization)&#13;
   and also basic computer and data skills. The IT program focused on the technical know-how that is required by&#13;
   the IT industry and introduces advanced training to graduates to plug the demand-supply gaps for the industry.&#13;
   This endeavor has been implemented with the support of many leading players in the industry â&#128;&#147; leading global&#13;
   players such as Infosys, IBM and Firstsource â&#128;&#147; and also domestic firms such as New Horizons. EDU Egypt has&#13;
   grown from the initial phase when it covered just 2 universities, to the current scale where it encompasses 10&#13;
   universities with 35 faculty and 10,000 students.&#13;

practice its employability in the ITES-BPO sector             Pakistan and Bhutan, both at 5 percent), the&#13;
is only 10-15 percent. While the quality of basic             overall quality of English language diction and&#13;
and technical computing skills is adequate, the               grammar is quite low in the potential talent pool.&#13;
problem lies in lack of soft skills such as quality           This lack of English language skills creates&#13;
of written and spoken English in particular and               challenges in terms of low employability levels,&#13;
written/verbal communication skills in general.               low level of IT usage since the primary language&#13;
This gap in quality is primarily attributed to the            of computing is English, and investment of time&#13;
fact that the medium of education in most schools             and money to train students to make them ready&#13;
is the local language, with English being just one            for the ITES-BPO industry (see boxes 5.2, 5.3,&#13;

&amp;#12;                Box 5.7: Orissa: Attracting Investments in the ITES-BPO Sector&#13;
The state of Orissa in eastern India has achieved major success in attracting investments in the ITES-BPO&#13;
sector. The state capital â&#128;&#147; Bhubaneswar â&#128;&#147; has become the hub for a few of the leading Indian ITES-BPO&#13;
companies. Total IT/ITES-BPO exports of the state amounted to USD 275 million in 2008-09. This growth&#13;
of the ITES-BPO sector was due to a concerted effort including:&#13;
&#13;
Â· Creation of an IT park and attracting an anchor client: One key requirement for any SEZ or IT Park&#13;
  to succeed is the need for an anchor client to set up operations in the area. By attracting an anchor client&#13;
  early in the process, the government has ensured the success of the basic mission of setting up IT parks&#13;
  in Rourkela, Behrampur and the recent one in Bhubaneswar.&#13;
Â· Setting up a nodal agency for the IT/ITES sector: The Orissa Computer Application Centre (OCAC)&#13;
  was set up as the nodal agency to carry out various training programs, both long and short term, to cater&#13;
  to the needs of the IT/ITES-BPO sectors. The OCAC has also effectively differentiated between IT and&#13;
  ITES and has helped in promotion of these in international fora. It has also undertaken assessment tests&#13;
  and initiated placement drives in association with some of the leading ITES-BPO players.&#13;
Â· Infrastructural support: The Orissa Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (IDCO)&#13;
  effectively handled all infrastructure requirements of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
All these factors have enabled Orissa to attract some of the largest IT and ITES-BPO players into the state.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Bangladesh sixth five year plan
            underscores the importance of exports for dynamism in the
            manufacturing sector and provision of high productivity and
            high income jobs. Indeed, faster export growth will be
            critical if Bangladesh is to achieve the accelerated growth
            necessary to reach its goal of becoming a middle income
            country by 2021. The focus of this study is to analyze the
            constraints to continued rapid growth in overall exports.
            This study seeks to focus on issues relating to i)
            continuation of fast growth in the basic garment sector; ii)
            providing an environment for encouraging export of mid and
            higher-value garments; iii) possibilities for
            diversification into IT-enabled services-business process
            outsourcing, or ITES-BPO; and iv) drawing some more general
            lessons for overall export growth.
