BUSINESS OVERVIEW&#13;
In partnership with private investors, IFC assists in financing the establishment, improvement, and expansion of private sector enterprises by&#13;
making investments where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. IFC seeks to bring together domestic and&#13;
foreign private capital and experienced management and thereby create conditions conducive to the flonv of private capital, domestic and&#13;
foreign, into productive investments in its developing member countries. In this way; IFC plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional project&#13;
funding from  other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through loan syndications, inderwritings, and guarantees. In addition&#13;
to project finance and resource mobilization, IFC offers financial and technical advisory services to private businesses in developing member&#13;
countries. It also advises member governments on private sector development matters.&#13;
IFC's investments are normally made in its developing memnber countries. The Articles of Agreement mandate that IFC shall invest in productive&#13;
private eniterprise. The requirement for private ownership does not disqualify enterprises that are partly owned by the public sector, if such&#13;
enterprises are organized under local commercial and corporate law, operate free of host government control in a market context and according&#13;
to profitability criteria and/or are in the process of being totally or partially privatized.&#13;
The Corporation applies stringent tests of enterprise soundness, project viability, aisd developmental impact in detertining the eligibility of&#13;
projects for its investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
INVESTMENT PROCESS AND PORTFOLIO SUPERVISION&#13;
IFC's investment process can be divided into six main stages:&#13;
IDENTIFICATION          BOARD               DOCUMENT             COMMITMENT            DISBURSEMENT          SUPERVISION&#13;
AND APPRAISAL          APPROVAL            NEGOTIATION&#13;
The initial four stages are carried out under the responsibility of the Vice President, Operations, while the fifth and sixth stages are overseer&#13;
by the Vice President, Portfolio and Risk Management.&#13;
The C:rporation carefully supervises its projects to monitor project performance and compliance with contractual obligations, and IFC's&#13;
internal policies and procedures. IFC's Board of Directors is informed of such matters and of recommended courses of action at regular&#13;
intervals.&#13;

The portfolio of disbursed and outstanding B-loans at June 30, 2000 (including securitized loans) totals $7.3 billion in 269 transactions&#13;
compared with $7.5 billion in 271 transactions at June 30, 1999.&#13;
Additional information on IFC's investment portfolio as of and for the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 can be found in Note D to the&#13;
Corporation's financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 (the FY00 financial statements).&#13;
INVESTMENT PRODUCTS&#13;
Loans&#13;
Loans account for the major part of the financing provided by IFC, representing 76% of the Corporation's disbursed investment portfolio&#13;
as of June 30, 2000, compared with 770% at June 30, 1 999.The Corporation's main investment activity is project financing. This encompasses&#13;
"greenfield" projects, expansions, and modernizations. IFC also provides corporate credits to selected companies to finance ongoing programs&#13;
of investment projects. In addition, the Corporation facilitates financing through financial intermediaries, covering project and general purpose&#13;
lending and specialized lending products such as leasing, trade, and mortgage finance. These financial intermediaries function either as IFC's&#13;
borrower, on-lending to private sector companies at their own risk, or as IFC's agent, identifying companies for direct loans from IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Loans will generally have the following characteristics:&#13;
Term: typically amortizing with final maturities of up to 12 years&#13;
Currency: primarily in major convertible currencies, principally US dollar, Euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen&#13;
Interest rate: fixed or variable&#13;
Pricing: reflects such factors as IFC's cost of funds, market conditions and country and project risks; variable rate loans are generally tied to&#13;
the 6-month LIBOR index in the relevant currency&#13;
Since FY99, IFC has offered local currency loan products to certain clients, provided the Corporation is able to hedge its local currency&#13;
exposure through mechanisms such as cross-currency swaps or forward contracts. Fixed rate loans and loans in other currencies are normally&#13;
transformed, using currency and/or interest rate swaps, into US dollar variable rate loans.&#13;
On June 30, 2000, total loans disbursed and outstanding were $8.3 billion ($7.7 billion at June 30, 1999). At June 30, 2000, 91% (91%&#13;
at Jime 30, 1999) of the Corporation's loans were US dollar-denominated. The currency composition of the loan portfolio is shown on the&#13;
accompanying diagram:&#13;

Equity and quasi-equity&#13;
Equity investments accounted for 240/o of the Corporation's disbursed investment portfolio at June 30, 2000, compared with 23% at June 31',&#13;
1999. IFC's equity investments are typically in the form of common or preferred stock and are usually denominated in the currency of the&#13;
country in Nvhich the investment is made.&#13;
In addition to traditional equity investments, the Corporation provides financing through a variety of quasi-equity instruments. Quasi-equit',&#13;
investments include subordinated or convertible loans or certain common or preferred shares with put and/or call features. Quasi-equity&#13;
investments constitute a small but growing portion of the Corporation's investment portfolio. Depending upon their characteristics, quasi-&#13;
equities may be classified as either loans or equity investments in the Corporation's balance sheet. At June 30, 2000 the Corporation's quasi-&#13;
equity portfolio totaled $1, 186 million ($995 million at June 30, 1999), of which $1,060 million was classified as loans ($913 million at&#13;
June 30, 1999) and $126 million ($82 million at June 30, 1999) was classified as equity investments in the Corporation's balance sheet.&#13;
Loan participations (B-loans)&#13;
IFC finances only a portion, usually not more than 25%, of the cost of any project. All IFC-financed projects, therefore, require other financial&#13;
partners. The principal direct means by which the Corporation mobilizes such private sector finance is through the sale of participations in its&#13;
loans, known as the B-loan program. Through the B-loan program, IFC has cooperated primarily with commercial banks but also with non-&#13;
6     bank financial institutions in financing projects since the early 1960s. More than 225 commercial banks and institutional investors currently&#13;
participate in IFC's B-loan program.&#13;
Whenever it syndicates a loan, IFC will always make a loan for its own account (an A-loan), thereby sharing the risk alongside its loan&#13;
4&#13;
participants. IFC acts as the lender of record and is responsible for the administration of the entire loan, including the B-loan. IFC charges&#13;
fees to the borrower at prevailing market rates to cover the cost of the syndication of the B-loan. Since it began its loan syndication program,&#13;
IFC has placed participations totaling $ 19.0 billion, reflecting actual participation agreements signed.&#13;
Private Sector Development Strategy&#13;
On December 18, 1999, the Boards of Directors of the IBRD and IFC approved a new Private Sector Development Integration Strategy (the PSD&#13;
Integration Strategy). It is intended to enhance the World Bank Group's effectiveness in developing the private sector in its member countries&#13;
z     through better coordination of planning and decision-making which maximizes the IBRD's policy experience and IFC's transaction skills.&#13;
a Pursuant to the PSD Integration Strategy, six jointly managed departments have been established. Three Global Product Groups are responsible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for IBRD and IFC advisory and investment projects in the following sectors respectively: (i) oil, gas and chemicals; (ii) mining; and (iii) infor-&#13;
mation and communication technologies. The three other joindy managed departments are: (i) the Small and Medium Enterprise Department,&#13;
which is responsible for private sector small and medium enterprise activities; (ii) the East Asia and Pacific/Small Business and Strategy&#13;
Department, which is responsible for private sector advisory and investment assignments in East Asia; and (iii) Private Sector Advisory Services,&#13;
which consolidates the activities of several advisory units across the World Bank Group, including Corporate Financial Services (CFS) in IFC, the&#13;
Private Sector Development Department in the IBRD, and the Foreign Investment Advisory Service, a joint facility of IFC and IBRD established in&#13;
1985 for purposes of attracting foreign direct investment to developing member countries.&#13;
Each of the new jointly managed departments has a single Director approved jointly by the IFC and the IBRD. Existing IFC and IBRD staff members&#13;
have been assigned to the new departments but remain staff members of their respective institutions. As individual advisory or investment     7&#13;
assignments arise, task teams will be formed composed of both IBRD and IFC staff, depending on the skill mix required. Operations of the&#13;
jointly managed departments are subject to conflicts of interest and confidentiality guidelines administered by an independent conflicts office.&#13;
Client risk management services&#13;
IFC provides clients access to asset and liability management tools such as interest rate swaps, currency- and commodity-indexed swaps, interest&#13;
rate caps and floors, and other derivative financial instruments by acting as an intermediary between clients and market counterparties. IFC also&#13;
provides risk-sharing structures and guarantees that allow its clients to transact directly with market counterparties. The Corporation requires&#13;
that all transactions are for hedging purposes only.&#13;
Guarantees&#13;
The Corporation's guarantee is available for debt instruments and trade obligations of clients and covers commercial as well as noncommercial&#13;
risks. Guarantee fees are calculated in a manner consistent with IFC's loan pricing policies. IFC will provide local currency guarantees but only&#13;
if the Corporation is able to fund its commitment in local currency terms, for example by hedging its exposure in the swap market.&#13;
Underwriting and investment banking services&#13;
IFC provides underwriting and placement services for equity, quasi-equity, and/or debt securities issues of private sector companies in IFC's&#13;
developing member countries. It also structures and underwrites country funds and pooled investment vehicles such as private investment&#13;
funds. IFC is often a core investor in the enterprises it underwrites. Services are priced in conformity with market standards and practices,&#13;
in consultation with international securities firms and financial intermediaries. Underwriting and other capital markets services requiring a&#13;
financial commitment from IFC are subject to the same investment criteria and limits applicable to its loan and equity investments.&#13;
The Corporation does not conduct any placement activities within the United States or directed at US investors in connection with securities&#13;
offerings of private sector companies or pooled investment vehicles.&#13;
Advisory activities&#13;
The Corporation provides three general types of advisory services to member countries as well as to individual enterprises:&#13;
l. Special advisory services on project structuring and financial packaging.&#13;
2. Financial advisory services provided to member governments or to private sector clients.&#13;
3. Policy advice to governments on capital markets development and private sector development, including privatization and foreign investment.&#13;
The Corporation (through the Private Sector Advisory Services Department, jointly managed with the World Bank) also assists governments&#13;
with developing the legal framework for privatizing their state-owned sectors, as well as with the sale of individual enterprises. Fees are&#13;
charged for advisory services consistent with market rates charged for comparable services. IFC charged fees amounting to $49 million for&#13;
the year ended June 30, 2000 ($33 million for the year ended June 30, 1999 and $66 million for the year ended June 30, 1998).&#13;
Specially targeted assistance&#13;
IFC has established a number of vehicles through which it can provide specially targeted assistance to areas highly in need of development.&#13;
These include its business advisory services serving Sub-Saharan Africa, the South Pacific Islands, Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic&#13;
Republic, Vietnam, and the Balkans; as well as its Technical Assistance Trust Funds, which provide technological assistance.&#13;
]V. TREASURY SERVICES&#13;
LIOUID ASSETS&#13;
IFC invests its surplus liquidity in highly rated fixed and floating rate instruments issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments,&#13;
other official entities including government agencies and instrumentalities, multilateral organizations, AAA-rated corporate issues, including&#13;
mortgage- and asset-backed securities, and time deposits and other unconditional obligations of banks and financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Corporation manages the market risk associated with these investments through a variety of hedging techniques including derivatives,&#13;
principally currency and interest rate swaps and financial futures.&#13;
IFC's liquid assets are invested in three separate portfolios.&#13;

2. Under guidelines in effect as of June 30, 2000, the P3 portfolio is not permitted to exceed 12% of the total value of liquid assets at any time.&#13;
3. The PI and P2 portfolios have been accounted for as available-for-sale portfolios through June 30, 2000. Effective July 1, 2000, these&#13;
portfolios will be redesignated as trading portfolios as discussed in Note A to the Corporation's financial statements for the year ended June&#13;
30, 2000.The P3 portfolio is accounted for as a trading portfolio.&#13;
All liquid assets are managed according to an investment authority approved by IFC's Board of Directors and investment guidelines approve(d&#13;
by IFC's Finance Committee, a subcommittee of the Corporation's Management Group.&#13;
CAPITALIZATION&#13;
The Corporation's capitalization as of June 30, 2000 and June 30, 1999 is as follows:&#13;

-  Retained earnings &amp; other&#13;
&gt;&#13;
z&#13;
z&#13;
Borrowings&#13;
The major source of IFC's borrowings is the international capital markets. Under the Articles of Agreement, the Corporation may borrow in thie&#13;
public markets of a member country only with approvals from that member and also the member in whose currency the borrowing is denom-&#13;
inated.The Corporation borrowed $4.4 billion during FY00 (FY99, $4.5 billion; FY98, $3.9 billion). In addition, IFC's Board of Directors has&#13;
authorized the repurchase, redemption and tender for debt obligations issued by the Corporation. During FY00, the Corporation repurchased&#13;
&lt;     and retired $200 million of outstanding debt ($139 million in FY99).&#13;
E&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IFC diversifies its borrowings by currency, country, source and maturity to provide flexibility and cost effectiveness. Outstanding market&#13;
borrowings have remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to almost 30 years with a weighted average remaining life of 6.7 years&#13;
at June 30, 2000 (5.4 years at June 30, 1999).&#13;
Market borrowings are generally swapped into floating rate obligations denominated in US dollars. As of June 30, 2000 the Corporation had&#13;
gross payables from borrowing-related currency swaps of $11.0 billion ($9.1 billion at June 30, 1999) and from borrowing-related interest&#13;
rate swaps in the notional principal amount of $5.1 billion ($4.3 billion at June 30, 1999). After considering the effect of these derivative&#13;
financial instruments all of the Corporation's market borrowings at June 3 0, 2000 and June 30, 1999 were US dollar-denominated.&#13;
The weighted average cost of market borrowings after currency and interest rate swap transactions was 6.3%/o at June 30, 2000 compared with   9&#13;
5. 1% at June 30, 1999.&#13;
Capital and retained earnings&#13;
As of June 30, 2000 IFC's net worth (presented as Total Capital in the Corporation's balance sheet) amounted to $5.7 billion, up from the&#13;
June 30, 1999 level of $5.3 billion.&#13;
As of June 30, 2000 and June 30, 1999, IFC's authorized capital xvas $2.45 billion, of which $2.37 billion was subscribed. Over 99% of this&#13;
was paid in ($2.36 billion at June 30, 2000; $2.35 billion at June 30, 1999).The subscription period for the share allocations made under the&#13;
1992 capital increases (as described in Note H to the Corporation's FY00 financial statements) closed on August 1, 1999. However, because&#13;
virtually all members elect to pay in installments for shares subscribed, there remains a difference between IFC's subscribed and paid-in capital&#13;
of $14 million ($24 million at June 30, 1999).&#13;
V. RISK MANAGEMENT AND FiNANCIAL POLICIES&#13;
RISKS IN IFC'S BUSINESS&#13;
IFC assumes various kinds of risks in its private sector development business. The Corporation's operations and activities are principally subject&#13;
to commercial or project risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Active management of these risks is an essential part&#13;
of the Corporation 's operations and a key determinant of its ability to maintain a stable capital and earnings base. It has adopted several key&#13;
financial policies and a number of prudential policies in order to manage and control commercial or project risk and liquidity risk associated&#13;
wvith its investment portfolio.&#13;
KEY FINANCIAL POLICIES&#13;
IFC operates under the following key financial policies which have been approved by its Board of Directors:&#13;
1. Disbursed equity plus quasi-equity investments (net of loss reserves) may not exceed 1 00% of IFC's net worth.&#13;
2. Disbursed equity investments (net of loss reserves) may not exceed 50% of IFC's net worth.&#13;
3. Minimum liquidity (including liquid assets and undrawn borrowing commitments from the World Bank) must be sufficient at all times&#13;
to cover at least 65% of IFC's estimated net cash requirements for the next three years.&#13;
4. The currency, rate basis and maturity of loan assets must be closely matched to borrowings.&#13;
5. Capital (including paid-in capital, retained earnings and general loss reserve) must equal at least 30% of risk-weighted assets.&#13;
In addition, under IFC's Articles of Agreement, as long as IFC has outstanding borrowings from the World Bank, IFC's leverage, as measured by the&#13;
ratio of IFC's debt (borrowings plus outstanding guarantees) to IFC's equity (subscribed capital plus retained earnings), may not exceed 4.0 to 1.&#13;
MANAGING COMMERCIAL (PROJECT) RISK&#13;
IFC is prohibited from accepting host government guarantees of repayment on its investments and therefore incurs the commercial risk of its&#13;
investments. In addition to the key financial policies specified above, the Corporation's investments are subject to a number of operational or&#13;
prudential limits, including limitations on single project exposure, single country exposure and segment concentration. Thus,&#13;
1. IFC does not normally finance for its own account more than 25% of a project's cost.&#13;
2. An equity investment in a company does not normally represent more than 35S%o of the company's total share capital, provided further&#13;
that IFC is not the single largest shareholder.&#13;
3. An investment in a single project or entity may not exceed 3% of IFC's total investment portfolio.&#13;
4. Equity and quasi-equity investments (as defined below) in a single project or entity may not exceed 3% of the Corporation's net worth&#13;
plus general reserves.&#13;
S. Total investments in a single country will not normally represent more than 1 2% of IFC's total investment portfolio or 25% of its net&#13;
worth, whichever is lower.&#13;
6. The Corporation's total exposure to a single risk sector may not exceed 8% of the total investment portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The quality of IFC's investment portfolio is monitored according to established supervision procedures. The portfolio management units of&#13;
individual investment departments are responsible for the day-to-day monitoring and management of commercial risk associated with projects&#13;
originated by the departments, including monitoring and evaluating credit quality of the borrowers.&#13;
Managing credit risk; loss reserves policy&#13;
Credit risk refers to the potential for a borrower, or a counterparty to a transaction with IFC, to default on its financial obligations to the&#13;
Corporation. IFC's Credit Review Department analyzes information obtained from the investment departments and provides an independent&#13;
review of the credit risk of IFC's borrowers.&#13;
IFC maintains a conservative loss reserves and revenue recognition policy. IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is ir&#13;
doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60 days unless management anticipates that collection of interest is expected&#13;
in the near future. The non-recognition of income on loans where interest or principal is past due more than 90 days is mandatory&#13;
IFC's loss reserves policy reflects management's judgment in accordance with the following guidelines. IFC considers a loan as impaired whien,&#13;
based on current information and events, it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan's contractual&#13;
terms. The reserve against losses for impaired loans represents management's judgment of the present value of expected future cash flows&#13;
discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. IFC establishes a reserve against losses for equity investments when a decrease in value of the&#13;
investment has occurred, below its US dollar equivalent cost, which is considered other than temporary. In addition to the reserve on speci fic&#13;
investments, the reserve against losses includes an estimate of potential losses resulting from risks that cannot be specifically identified. The&#13;
reserve against losses is maintained through annual charges to income. Investments written off, as well as any subsequent recoveries, are&#13;
recorded through the reserve.&#13;
The quality of IFC's portfolio was negatively affected by the Asian crisis during FY98 and its contagion effect. During FY99 the portfolio&#13;
was further affected by continuing economic problems in emerging markets, although the impact was less serious than in FY98. Currency&#13;
devaluations and stock market declines in emerging markets have continued to erode the value of IFC's equity investments.&#13;
A key indicator of portfolio performance, the amount of nonaccruing loans as a percentage of the disbursed loan portfolio, remained&#13;
unchanged at 11. 1% at June 30, 2000 compared with June 30, 1999. The principal amount outstanding on nonaccrual loans totaled&#13;
$922 million at June 30, 2000, an increase of 7.6% from the June 30, 1999 level of $857 million.&#13;
The environment of FY98 and FY99 resulted in historically high levels of reserves against losses at June 30, 1999 of 18.2% of IFC's disburs, d&#13;
loan and equity investment portfolio. As of June 30, 2000 IFC's total reserve against losses amounted to $1 ,973 million ($ 1,825 million at&#13;
June 30, 1999).This is equivalent to 18.0% of the disbursed portfolio, down from the historical high at the end of FY99. The five-year treled&#13;
of loss reserves is presented below:&#13;

17.5-_&#13;
FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2000&#13;
10&#13;
vMAs a prudential measure, the Corporation's Liquidity Policy requires the maintenance at all times of sufficient liquidity (including liquid assets&#13;
and undrawn borrowing commitments from the World Bank) to cover as least 65% of its estimated net cash requirements for the next three&#13;
c:years. As a prudential measure, the Corporation maintains an operating liquidity target of not less than 70% of three years' net cash require-&#13;
F ments, including projected disbursement and debt service requirements. At June 30, 2000 the Corporation's iquidity level stood at $12.2&#13;
billion, or 103% of its projected net cash requirements for the next three years ($10.1 billion, and 106% at June  30, 1999).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
MANAGING MARKET RISK&#13;
Market risk refers to changes in values of financial instruments or positions due to movements in interest or exchange rates, or to liquidity factors.&#13;
Liquid asset investment activities&#13;
As already noted, the P I and P3 portfolios are generally invested, directly or synthetically, in floating rate US dollar instruments under the&#13;
Corporation's existing conservative guidelines. This reflects the Corporation's matched-funding policy, which requires that all loans be funded&#13;
with liabilities bearing similar interest rate and currency characteristics, and the fact that its loans are predominantly denominated in floating&#13;
rate US dollars. Implementation of the matched-funding policy is a two-step process: funds are earmarked at Board approval stage, and&#13;
matched, with respect to interest rate and currency, at disbursement. This policy limits the Corporation's exposure to unmatched interest&#13;
rate and exchange risks. Beginning in FYO I, the Corporation proposes to manage interest rate risk in the PI portfolio on an overall basis by&#13;
investing in fixed or floating rate instruments against a standard benchmark within specified risk parameters, in lieu of the current approach&#13;
of investing, directly or synthetically, in only 6-month floating rate assets. As discussed below, residual market risks are managed on a portfolio&#13;
basis by the Asset and Liability Management Unit within the Corporation's Treasury Department. The P2 portfolio is invested in fixed rate&#13;
US dollar-denominated instruments. Unlike the P1 portfolio, which accepts mostly credit risk, the P2 portfolio has additional flexibility to&#13;
deviate from its duration benchmark and therefore incurs market risk as well.&#13;
IFC uses a variety of derivative financial instruments in its liquidity management activities for hedging purposes, to take advantage of profitable&#13;
trading opportunities, and as a proxy for cash securities. The derivative financial instruments used include short-term, over-the-counter foreign&#13;
exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded futures and options on fixed-income instruments.&#13;
Borrowing activities&#13;
The objectives of minimizing its borrowing costs, diversifying funding sources, and developing member countries' capital markets leads the&#13;
Corporation to issue securities in various capital markets, sometimes using complex structures. These structures include borrowings payable&#13;
in multiple currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a stock market index,&#13;
a reference interest rate, a commodity index, or one or more foreign exchange rates. As described above, the market risk associated with fixed&#13;
rate obligations and structured instruments is mitigated by using derivative financial instruments to convert them into variable rate US dollar&#13;
obligations, consistent with the Corporation's matched funding policy.&#13;
Lending activities&#13;
Derivative financial instruments are used in connection with the Corporation's lending activities to minimize the level of interest rate and&#13;
currency exchange risk in non-US dollar lending.&#13;
Client risk management activities&#13;
The Corporation offers risk management products to its clients and seeks to minimize its exposure to market risk resulting from derivative asset&#13;
and liability management transactions with clients by entering into offsetting positions with highly rated market counterparties.&#13;
Asset and liability management activities&#13;
Beyond the risk managed in the context of its liquid asset management and borrowing activities, IFC faces residual market risk in its overall&#13;
asset and liability management, which is monitored by the Asset and Liability Management Unit within the Corporation's Treasury Department.&#13;
While IFC's matched funding policy provides a significant level of protection against currency and interest rate risk, it is still exposed to&#13;
currency risk due to the receipt of spread income in currencies other than US dollars or other events, such as changes in the level of non-&#13;
US dollar reserves against loans. IFC manages this currency risk by monitoring the aggregate position in each lending currency and eliminating&#13;
the net asset or liability position in excess of S I million equivalent through spot sales or purchases.&#13;
IFC also faces residual interest rate risk from two sources:&#13;
1. assets that are fully match-funded at inception can become mismatched over time due to writedowvns, prepayments, or rescheduling, and&#13;
2. LIBOR reset dates on assets can differ from those on liabilities.&#13;
Interest rate risk due to reset date mismatches is reduced by synchronizing the reset dates on assets and liabilities and managing overall interest&#13;
rate risk on an aggregate basis. Interest rate risk arising from mismatches due to writedowns, prepayments and reschedulings, and residual reset&#13;
date mismatches is monitored by measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point&#13;
change in interest rates. A review trigger of $50,000 equivalent has been established on this measure for interest rate exposure in the aggregate&#13;
and in each currency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MANAGING CREDIT RISK&#13;
Loan and equity investments&#13;
The risk of borrower default in connection with the Corporation's loan and equity investments is discussed above, under Managing Commtercial&#13;
(Project) Risk.&#13;
Treasury counterparty credit risk&#13;
Counterparty credit risk is the principal residual risk to the Corporation arising from its liquid assets and borrowing activities. IFC's credit&#13;
policies set conservative eligibility criteria for counterparties and diversification caps on exposure to individual counterparties. IFC currently&#13;
restricts counterparty eligibility to banks and financial institutions with a minimum rating of A. In order to limit exposure to counterparties,&#13;
IFC signs collateral agreements with counterparties that require the posting of collateral when net exposure exceeds certain predetermined&#13;
thresholds, which decreases as a counterparty's credit rating deteriorates. Because counterparties can be downgraded during the life of a&#13;
transaction, the agreements provide an option for IFC to terminate all swaps if the counterparty is downgraded below investment grade.&#13;
Limits are also imposed on the volume of over-the-counter derivative transactions with individual counterparties. IFC measures derivatives&#13;
exposure to counterparties in terms of "worst case" potential exposure based on simulations of market variables which are updated monthly&#13;
to reflect market movements.&#13;
These restrictions and limits are revised annually at the beginning of each fiscal year and approved by IFC's Finance Committee. During the&#13;
year, institution-specific limits are updated monthly based on changes in counterparty size or credit status. For exchange-traded instruments,&#13;
IFC limits credit risk by restricting transactions to a list of authorized exchanges, contracts and dealers, and by placing limits on the&#13;
Corporation's open interest rate position in each contract.&#13;
Credit risks arising in connection with IFC's treasury activities are monitored and controlled in accordance with credit risk guidelines&#13;
established by the Risk Management Group (formerly the Financial Policy &amp; Planning Unit).&#13;
Client risk management activities&#13;
The Corporation minimizes its credit risk exposure to clients with which it transacts derivative asset and liability management business by&#13;
conducting credit appraisals of the clients.&#13;
MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK&#13;
Operational risk is the potential for losses arising from internal activities or external events caused by breakdowns in information systems,&#13;
communications, physical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing, and the execution of legal, fiduciary and agency&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
Like all financial institutions, IFC is exposed to many types of operational risks. It seeks to mitigate such risks by maintaining a comprehensive&#13;
system of internal controls that is designed not only to identify the parameters of various risks but also to monitor and control those areas of&#13;
particular concern. The Corporation has adopted the COSO  control framework and a self-assessment methodology to evaluate the effectiveness&#13;
of its internal controls, and it has an ongoing program in place to cover all significant operations. In each of the last five fiscal years, IFC ha,&#13;
obtained an attestation report from its external auditors on its assertion that as of June 30 of each of the fiscal years, its system of internal&#13;
control over financial reporting met the criteria for effective internal control described in COSO and that the Corporation's assertion is fairly&#13;
stated in all material respects.&#13;
During FY00 several ongoing initiatives emphasized the area of operational risk management. These included:&#13;
I. The replacement of numerous legacy systems in areas such as financial accounting and administrative expense processing including budget,&#13;
expense, travel, procurement and leave and attendance administration&#13;
12     2. A risk rating and portfolio supervision reporting system&#13;
3. A client relationship information system&#13;
,     4. An investment operations pipeline management system.&#13;
2&#13;
The Corporation also appointed a new global custodian at the beginning of FY00 to centralize custodianship of its liquid assets and physical&#13;
z     equity share portfolios during FY00 to streamline and enhance existing controls and reporting. In addition, the Corporation is in the process&#13;
v'    of implementing an integrated treasury management system.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION IN EUROPE&#13;
Since January 1, 1999, in the normal course of business as a multicurrency organization, IFC has been conducting Euro-denominated transac-&#13;
tions in paying and receiving, liquid asset investments, debt issuance and in its loan and equity investment portfolio activities. IFC has adopted&#13;
a gradual approach to redenominating national currency balance sheet items to Euro during the transition period. The incremental cost of Euro&#13;
conversion in FY99 was immaterial to the Corporation's financial statements and has been induded in the Corporation's administrative expenses.&#13;
YEAR 2000 ISSUES&#13;
The "Year 2000" issue arose because some computer programs and embedded process control chips use two digits, rather than four, to define&#13;
the applicable year. With the advent of Year 2000, this approach could have resulted in potential calculation and logical comparison errors for  13&#13;
automated systems in support of administrative, financial, and process control functions.&#13;
The primary goal of the Corporation'sYear 2000 Project was to ensure that the Corporation's vital business processes would operate in the&#13;
next millennium. Additional goals were:&#13;
1. To protect IFC from legal liability stemming from its own unpreparedness or that of vendors, suppliers, correspondent banks&#13;
2. To ensure that IFC client companies understood the nature and urgency of theYear 2000 issue, and consequences of noncompliance&#13;
3. To assist IFC cient companies in dealing effectively with such issues.&#13;
The Corporation's Year 2000 Project lasted more than two-and-a-half years and cost approximately $2.5 million, including $2.0 million for&#13;
client company readiness assessments and related activities. As a result of IFC's initiative to foster client education and awareness activities,&#13;
many of its client companies initiated a Year 2000 plan and developed their own contingency planning programs.&#13;
IFC did not experience any materialYear 2000 related problems on or after January 1, 2000, either at Headquarters or in any of its country offices.&#13;

The following paragraphs detail significant variances between FY00 &amp; FY99, and FY99 &amp; FY98, covering the periods included in the&#13;
Corporation's Financial Statements for FY00.&#13;
FY00 VERSUS FY99&#13;
Net income&#13;
The Corporation's net income for FY00 was $380 million, substantially higher than FY99's net income of $249 million. Several components&#13;
of net income varied significantly in FY00 as compared with FY99 although the majority of the improved performance was as a result of a&#13;
more stable portfolio quality which resulted in lower provisions for losses in FY00 ($215 million) compared with FY99 ($333 million).&#13;
Net interest income&#13;
IFC's primary interest earning assets are its loan portfolio and its liquid assets portfolios. After charges on borrowings are taken into account,&#13;
net interest income improved by $9 million or 2% from $469 million in FY99 to $478 million in FY00.&#13;
Interest and financial fees for FY00 were $694 million, compared with $607 million for FY99, an increase of 14.3%. The disbursed and&#13;
outstanding loan portfolio grew by 7.4%, the Corporation's interest collection rate was marginally higher in FY00 than in FY99 and the&#13;
interest rate environment in general was higher during FY00 than in FY99. Offsetting these positive effects on interest and financial fees,&#13;
loans in nonaccrual status grew from $857 million at June 30, 1999 to $922 million at June 30, 2000, an increase of 7.6%.&#13;
tncome from time deposits and securities for FY00 was $596 million, $64 million higher than the $532 million recorded in FY99. The liquid&#13;
assets portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities, grew from $ 10. I billion to $12.2 billion largely funded by the growth&#13;
in the Corporation's borrowings program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The $2.1 billion growth in the liquid assets portfolio, combined with the overall higher interest rate environment, resulted in an $86 million&#13;
increase in interest income in the P1 and P2 portfolios (classified as available-for-sale). As part of its management of the P2 portfolio, IFC&#13;
periodically buys newer issue US treasury bonds funded through the sale of older, less liquid securities. Due to the rising interest rate&#13;
environment in FY00 and FY99, losses were realized on such sales undertaken in both years. In FY00, realized losses wvere $42 million&#13;
compared with $22 million in FY99. Income on the P3 portfolio (classified as trading) declined by $2 million in FY00. The decline was&#13;
attributable to the heavy volatility of bond markets, the flattening of the US yield curve, and the consequent widening of swap spreads wh ch&#13;
particularly hit IFC's portfolio of asset-backed securities.&#13;
The Corporation's charges on borrowings rose by $142 million during FY00 from $670 million to $812 million, reflecting the growth of the&#13;
borrowings portfolio and the rising interest rate environment. After the effect of associated derivative financial instruments, the borrowings&#13;
portfolio grew by $2.6 billion in FY00 from $ 13.2 billion at June 30, 1999 to $15.8 billion.&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
Overall income from the equity investment portfolio declined marginally by $3 million, or 1%, from $265 million in FY99 to $262 million&#13;
in FY00.&#13;
The Corporation generated capital gains for FY00 of $132 million as compared with $166 million for FY99, a decline of 20%. During the&#13;
early part of FY98, IFC was able to liquidate a number of individual equity investment holdings to realize capital gains due to a relatively&#13;
strong environment in the emerging markets. Subsequent to various crises in late FY98 and early FY99, this trend did not continue and led&#13;
to the decline in realized capital gains in FY99 and into FY00.&#13;
Dividend income, however, rose to $130 million for FY00 as compared with $99 million for FY99. The growth in dividend income was&#13;
largely attributable to the growth in oil prices during FY00 which significantly improved returns on the Corporation's joint ventures in oil&#13;
gas and mining.&#13;
Provisions for losses on investments&#13;
The income charge for provisions for losses of $215 million in FY00 was significantly lower than the charge in FY99 of $333 million, a&#13;
decline of $118 million or 35%. On June 30, 2000 the Corporation's total reserves against losses on loan and equity investments were 18.3%&#13;
of the disbursed and outstanding portfolio (18.2% at June 30, 1999). Provisions were lower in FY00 because impairment was less severe than&#13;
in FY99, reflecting a more stable portfolio quality&#13;
Noninterest income&#13;
Noninterest income of $130 million for FY00 was $17 million higher than FY99 ($113 million), principally due to the sale of assets,&#13;
including assets associated with the Corporation's information provision business. Service fees were also higher at $49 million for FY00&#13;
as compared with $33 million for FY99.&#13;
Offsetting these factors, there was a decrease in net periodic pension income from the Staff Retirement Plan and from the change in the&#13;
Corporation's share of net assets held for postretirement benefits, from $64 million in FY99 to $48 million in FY00.&#13;
Noninterest expense&#13;
Adnministrative expenses (the principal component of noninterest expense) rose 3.5% from $258 million in FY99 to $267 million in FY00&#13;
This increase was in line with budget funding of the anticipated growth in the investment portfolio and the continuing move into smaller&#13;
investments in frontier countries within IFC's portfolio.&#13;
FY99 VERSUs FY98&#13;
4    Net income&#13;
The Corporation's net income for FY99 was $249 million, marginally higher than FY98's net income of $246 million. In spite of the stable&#13;
&lt;    overall level of net income, several components of net income have varied significantly in FY99 as compared with FY98. The decrease in&#13;
&lt;    provisions for losses from $481 million to $333 million was offset by:&#13;
z.&#13;
o     1. the decrease in net interest income from $482 million to $469 million;&#13;
5 2. the decrease in income from equity investments from $314 million to $265 million;&#13;
O    3. the increase in noninterest expense from $229 million to $265 million; and&#13;
4. the decrease in noninterest income (including the effect of the accounting change in FY98) from $ 160 million to $113 million.&#13;
z&#13;
E&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Net interest income&#13;
IFC's primary interest earning assets are its loan portfolio and its liquid assets portfolios. With charges on borrowings taken into account,&#13;
net interest income declined by $ 13 million or 3% from $482 million in FY98 to $469 million in FY99.&#13;
Interest and financial fees for FY99 were $607 million, compared with $583 million for FY98, an increase of 4%. The growth in the disbursed&#13;
and outstanding loan portfolio of 12% was substantially offset by a 3% reduction in interest collection rates resulting from the growth in loans&#13;
in nonaccrual status from $633 million at June 30, 1998 to $857 million at June 30, 1999.&#13;
Income from deposits and securities for FY99 was $532 million, slightly lower than the $550 million recorded in FY98. The liquid assets&#13;
portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities, grew from $9.4 billion to $10.1 billion and interest rates rose, especially during  15&#13;
the second half of FY99. However, the $9 million increase in interest income and $1 2 million increase in realized gains in the Corporation's&#13;
trading portfolios, were offset by $22 million of realized losses in the available for sale portfolios ($17 million gain in FY98), which primarily&#13;
occurred on sales during the second half of FY99.&#13;
The Corporation's charges on borrowings rose by $19 million during FY99 from $651 million to $670 million reflecting a growth in the&#13;
borrowings portfolio (after the effect of associated derivative financial instruments), offset by a reduction in average borrowings costs.&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
The Corporation generated capital gains for FY99 of $166 million as compared with $217 million for FY98, a decline of 23%. Dividend&#13;
income was relatively stable at $99 million for FY99 as compared with $96 million for FY98. Overall income from the equity investment&#13;
portfolio declined by $49 million, or 16%, from $314 million in FY98 to $265 million in FY99.&#13;
During FY97 and the early part of FY98, IFC was able to liquidate a number of individual equity investment holdings to realize capital gains&#13;
due to a relatively strong environment in the emerging markets. Subsequent to various crises in late FY98 and early FY99, this trend did not&#13;
continue and led to the decline in realized capital gains in FY99.&#13;
Provisions for losses on investments&#13;
The income charge for provisions for losses of $333 million in FY99 was significantly lower than the historically high level of $481 million in&#13;
FY98, a decline of $148 million or 31%. At June 30, 1999 the Corporation's total reserves against losses on loan and equity investments were&#13;
18.2% of the disbursed and outstanding portfolio (17.0% at June 30, 1998). Provisions were lower in FY99 because impairment during FY99&#13;
was less severe than in FY98. This trend continued through FY99, so that provisions recorded during the second half of the year were lower&#13;
than in the first half ($73 million as compared to $260 million).&#13;
Noninterest income&#13;
Noninterest income of $113 million for FY99 was lower than FY98 ($160 million), principally due to the FY98 nonrecurring income of&#13;
$34 million resulting from the change in accounting for other postretirement benefits. Also contributing to the decline were lower service&#13;
fees of $33 million for FY99 as compared with $66 million for FY98. This was a result of less favorable market conditions for IFC's technical&#13;
and advisory assistance services and resource mobilization services.&#13;
Offsetting these factors, there wvas an increase in net periodic pension income from the Staff Retirement Plan and from the change in the&#13;
Corporation's share of net assets held for postretirement benefits, from $55 million in FY98 to $64 million in FY99.&#13;
Noninterest expense&#13;
Administrative expenses (the principal component of noninterest expense) rose 18% from $218 million in FY98 to $258 million in FY99.&#13;
This increase was in line with budget funding of the anticipated growth in the investment portfolio and the move into smaller investments&#13;
in frontier countries within IFC's portfolio. In addition, the Corporation instigated a number of new initiatives in FY99 to fund theYear 2000&#13;
Project, the implementation of the Euro and continued funding of its Africa Enterprise Fund and Small and Medium Enterprise Fund.&#13;

Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
PURPOSE&#13;
The International Finance Corporation (the Corporation), an international organization, was established in 1956 to further economic devel-&#13;
opment in its member countries by encouraging the growth of private enterprise. The Corporation is a member of the World Bank Group,&#13;
which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association, and the  23&#13;
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) . The Corporation's activities are closely coordinated with and complement the overall devel-&#13;
opment objectives of the other World Bank Group institutions. The Corporation, together with private investors, assists in financing the estab-&#13;
lishment, improvement and expansion of private sector enterprises by making loan and equity investments where sufficient private capital is&#13;
not otherwise available on reasonable terms. The Corporation's share capital is provided by its member countries. It raises most of the funds&#13;
for its investment activities through the issuance of notes, bonds and other debt securities in the international capital markets. The Corporation&#13;
also plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional project funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through&#13;
loan syndications, underwritings and guarantees. In addition to project finance and resource mobilization, the Corporation offers an array&#13;
of financial and technical advisory serv7ices to private businesses in the developing world to increase their chances of success. It also advises&#13;
governments on how to create an environment hospitable to the growth of private enterprise and foreign investment.&#13;
NOTE A-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (US&#13;
GAAP) and with International Accounting Standards (IAS).&#13;
Financial statements presentation-Certain amounts in the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.&#13;
Use of estimates-The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with US GAAP and LAS requires management to make estimates&#13;
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the&#13;
financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these&#13;
estimates. A significant degree of judgment has been used in the determination of the adequacy of the reserve against losses on loan and equity&#13;
investments, and in the determination of net periodic pension income. There are inherent risks and uncertainties related to the Corporation's&#13;
operations. The possibility exists that changing economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Corporation.&#13;
Translation of currencies-Assets and liabilities not denominated in United States dollars (US dollars or $), other than disbursed equity&#13;
investments, are expressed in US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at June 30, 2000 and June 3 0, 1999. Disbursed equity investments&#13;
are expressed in US dollars at the prevailing exchange rates at the time of disbursement. Income and expenses are translated at the rates of&#13;
exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction. Translation gains and losses are credited or charged to income.&#13;
Loan and equity investments-Loan and equity investments are recorded as assets when disbursed. Loan investments are carried at the&#13;
principal amounts outstanding. It is the Corporation's practice to obtain collateral security such as, but not limited to, mortgages and third-&#13;
party guarantees. Equity investments are carried at cost. On occasion the Corporation enters into put and call option agreements in connection&#13;
with equity investments.&#13;
Reserve against losses for loan and equity investments-The Corporation considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information&#13;
and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. The reserve&#13;
against losses for impaired loans represents management's judgment of the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's&#13;
effective interest rate. The Corporation establishes a reserve against losses for equity investments when a decrease in value of the investments&#13;
has occurred which is considered other than temporary The reserve against losses for loan and equity investments includes an estimate of&#13;
potential losses on loan and equity investments not specifically identifiable. The reserve is established through annual charges to income in the&#13;
forns of a provision for losses on investments. Investments written off, as well as any subsequent recoveries, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
Revenue recognition on loan and equity investments-Dividends and profit participations are recorded as income when received in freely&#13;
convertible currencies. Gains on the sale of equity investments are measured against the average cost of the investments sold and are recorded&#13;
as income when received in freely convertible currencies.&#13;
Interest income and commitment fees on loan investments are recorded as income on an accrual basis. .All other fees are recorded as income&#13;
when received in freely convertible currencies. The Corporation does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or&#13;
payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60 days unless management anticipates that collection of interest will occur in the&#13;
near future. Any interest accrued on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is reversed out of income and is thereafter recognized as income only&#13;
when the actual payment is received. Interest not previously recognized but capitalized as part of a debt restructuring is recorded as deferred&#13;
income an-d credited to income only when the related principal is received.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Liquid assets-As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, to diversify its credit exposure to commercial banks and to obtain high r&#13;
returns, the Corporation invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits and asset-backed securities according to the Corporat:ion's&#13;
credit risk and duration policies. Government and agency obligations include highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills and other obligations&#13;
issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities including government agencies and instrumental-&#13;
ities or by multilateral organizations. The Corporation converts these fixed rate government and agency obligations into variable rate US dollar&#13;
instruments by entering into currency and interest rate swaps.&#13;
Securities classified as available for sale, which are those securities that may be sold prior to maturity as part of asset and liability management&#13;
or in response to other factors, are carried at fair value with any changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income. Securities&#13;
classified as trading are carried at market value with any changes in fair value reported in income from time deposits and securities. lnteres':&#13;
and dividends on securities and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in income from time deposits and securities.&#13;
Realized gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale or trading, which are computed by the average cost method, are included&#13;
in income from time deposits and securities.&#13;
The Corporation classifies due from banks, time deposits, and securities classified as trading and available for sale (collectively, liquid assets)&#13;
as an element of liquidity in the statement of cash flows because of their nature and the Corporation's policies governing the level and use&#13;
of such investments.&#13;
On July 1, 2000 the Corporation redesignated its available for sale securities as trading securities, resulting in a transfer of $5 million from&#13;
other comprehensive income to net income in the year ending June 30, 2001.&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements-Repurchase agreements are contracts under which a party sells securities and simultaneously agrees&#13;
to repurchase the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Resale agreements are contracts under which a party purchases&#13;
securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Securities purchased under resale&#13;
agreements, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities payable for cash collateral received are valued at cost, on the basis&#13;
that cost approximates market value.&#13;
Borrowings-To diversify its access to funding and reduce its borrowing costs, the Corporation borrows in a variety of currencies and uses&#13;
a number of borrowing structures, including inverse floating rate and zero coupon notes. Generally, the Corporation simultaneously convert;&#13;
such borrowings into variable rate US dollar borrowiings through the use of currency and interest rate swap transactions. Under certain&#13;
outstanding borrowing agreements, the Corporation is not permitted to mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its assets (other than&#13;
purchase money security interests) without extending equivalent security to the holders of such borrowings.&#13;
Derivative financial instruments-In the normal course of business, the Corporation is a party to derivative financial instruments with&#13;
off-balance sheet risk used to manage its exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates. These instruments include currency and&#13;
interest rate swaps, covered forwards, commodity-indexed swaps, commodity-indexed options and forward contracts on its own behalf&#13;
and fbr clients, guarantees for third parties, futures contracts and short sales. In addition, the Corporation issues warrants and purchases&#13;
matching over-the-counter options to hedge these transactions.&#13;
Derivative financial instruments associated with the trading and available for sale portfolios are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value,&#13;
consistent with the recording of the underlying financial instrument. Other derivative financial instruments are accounted for on the&#13;
amortized cost method. Income or expense is recognized over the life of the associated instrument as an element of charges on borrowings&#13;
or service fees, depending on the purpose for which the financial instrument associated with the derivative financial instrument is used.&#13;
The cash settlement value of warrants and associated options is reported gross on the balance sheet and is included in receivables and other&#13;
assets and payables and other liabilities. Income and expense from warrants and associated options are recognized as an element of charges&#13;
on borrowings.&#13;
Intermediation services-Where it acts as an intermediary on currency and interest rate swaps, options or forward contracts, the Corporation&#13;
minimizes its exposure to credit risk by performing credit reviews of the clients and minimizes its exposure to currency and interest rate risks&#13;
by entering into offsetting swap, option, or forward contract positions with highly rated market counterparties.&#13;
Resource mobilization-The Corporation mobilizes funds from commercial banks and other financial institutions (Participants) through&#13;
24    loan participations which are sold by the Corporation, without recourse, to Participants. These loan participations are administered and serviced&#13;
by the Corporation on behalf of the Participants. The disbursed and outstanding balances of the loan participations are not included in the&#13;
Corporation's balance sheet.&#13;
Staff Retirement Plan-The World Bank Group has a defined benefit retirement plan (the Plan) covering substantially all of the Corporation's&#13;
staff. The Plan also covers substantially all the staff of IBRD and MIGA. Under the Plan, benefits are based on the years of contributory service&#13;
and the highest three-year average of pensionable remuneration as defined in the Plan, with the staff contributing a fixed percentage of&#13;
pensionable remuneration and the World Bank Group contributing the remainder of the actuarially determined cost of future Plan benefits.&#13;
The actuarial present values of Plan obligations throughout the fiscal year are determined at the beginning of the fiscal year by the Plan's&#13;
actuary. The Corporation's total contribution to the Plan is based upon the aggregate funding method. All contributions to the Plan and all&#13;
other assets and income held for purposes of the Plan are held separately from the other assets and income of the World Bank Group and&#13;
z     can be used only for the benefit of the participants in the Plan and their beneficiaries, until all liabilities to them have been paid or provided&#13;
for. Plan assets consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities, with small holdings of cash, real estate and other investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The net periodic pension income or expense allocated to the Corporation is included in income from (contributions to) Staff Retirement Plan&#13;
in the income statement.&#13;
Other postretirement benefits-Other postretirement benefits are provided for eligible active and retired World Bank Group staff, including&#13;
those of the Corporation, through a Retired Staff Benefits Plan and a Post Employment Benefits Plan.&#13;
Some of the assets designated for other postretirement benefits meet the requirements for plan assets prescribed under SFAS No. 106,&#13;
Employers Accountingfor Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Other plan assets ahd liabilities that do not qualify for off-&#13;
balance sheet accounting are recorded on IBRD's balance sheet. The Corporation includes a receivable from IBRD in receivables and other assets&#13;
relating to its share of these postretirement benefits net assets, representing prepaid postretirement benefits costs. Any increase or decrease in  25&#13;
the Corporation's share of these net assets is recognized in increase (decrease) in share of net assets held for postretirement benefits in the&#13;
income statement.&#13;
Introduction of the Euro-Effective January 1, 1999 eleven member states of the European Union adopted the Euro as their common currency&#13;
and the European Currency Unit was automatically redenominated into the Euro. Amounts stated in Euros appearing herein for both the current&#13;
and prior periods have been recast from the legacy currencies regardless of the timing of the redenomination of the instruments concerned.&#13;
Recasting has had no impact on the US dollar equivalents reported in these financial statements except insofar as, in the footnotes that disclose&#13;
currency analyses of balance sheet amounts, legacy currency items have been aggregated and single Euro amounts are disclosed in their place.&#13;
Caution is advised when analyzing the information in the footnotes concerned, as the data may not be readily comparable to similar data&#13;
disclosed by other organizations in similar footnotes.&#13;
Accounting and financial reporting developments-In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board extended the effective date of&#13;
Financial Accounting Standard No. 133 (SFAS No. 133), Accountingfor Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, by one year. An&#13;
amendment to the Standard, SFAS No. 138, Accountingfor Certain Derivative Instrurments and Certain HedgingActivities, was issued&#13;
on June 16, 2000. Both Standards (the Standards) were effective for the Corporation on July 1, 2000. The Standards require that all derivatives&#13;
are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, at fair value. Subject to certain qualifying conditions, a derivative may be&#13;
designated as either a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability (fair value hedge) or a hedge of the variability of cash flows of an asset or&#13;
liability or forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge). For a derivative qualifying as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative&#13;
are reported in earnings along with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that are attributable to the risk being hedged. For a&#13;
derivative qualifying as a cash flow hedge, fair value gains or losses associated with the risk being hedged would be reported in a separate&#13;
component of stockholders' equity (other comprehensive income) and then amortized into earnings in the period(s) in which the hedged&#13;
item affects income. For a derivative not qualifying as a hedge, fair value gains and losses would be reported in earnings. The Corporation is&#13;
currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact of these Standards on its internal operations and financial reporting, including any&#13;
transition adjustment.&#13;
In March 1999, the International Accounting Standards Committee issued IAS No. 39, Financial Instruments Recognition and&#13;
Measurement. The Standard prescribes balance sheet recognition of all financial assets and financial liabilities, including derivatives. It requires&#13;
financial assets and financial liabilities to be initially measured at cost, and to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet thereafter. The&#13;
Standard is effective for the Corporation for the year ending June 30, 2002; however, early application is permitted.The Corporation is&#13;
currently in the process of evaluating the impact that will result from the adoption of IAS No. 39 and is, therefore, unable to disclose the&#13;
impact that adoption of this Standard will have on the Corporation's results of operations or financial position.&#13;

z    NOTE L-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CREDIT RISK&#13;
0&#13;
Derivative financial instruments involve elements of credit and market risk in excess of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet. The&#13;
o    contractual or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the Corporation's involvement in such instruments. Credit risk repre-&#13;
sents the maximum potential accounting loss due to possible nonperformance by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contract.&#13;
Market risk represents the potential loss due to a decrease in the value of a derivative financial instrument caused primarily by changes in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
interest rates or currency exchange rates. The Corporation's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties for&#13;
currency swaps and guarantees is represented by the contractual or notional amounts of these instruments. For interest rate swaps, covered&#13;
forwards, futures and option contracts, commodity-indexed contracts, interest rate caps and guarantees on swaps, the contractual or notional&#13;
amounts do not represent exposure to credit loss.&#13;
The Corporation is highly selective in its choice of counterparties and does not consider nonperformance to represent a significant risk.&#13;
For derivative financial instruments, the Corporation limits activity to a list of authorized dealers and counterparties. Credit limits have been&#13;
established for each counterparty by type of instrument and maturity category and collateral agreements have been executed with counter-&#13;
parties in order to further minimize the Corporation's exposure to credit risk. Under these agreements, the Corporation may accept collateral&#13;
in the form of cash or other approved liquid securities from individual counterparties in order to mitigate its credit exposure.              3&#13;
A summary of the aggregate contractual or notional amounts of derivative and other financial instruments is as follows (US$ millions):&#13;

NOTE M-ESTiMATED FAIR VALUE OF FiNANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
34    Many of the Corporation's financial instruments lack a trading market, characterized as exchanges betveen willing buyers and sellers.&#13;
Accordingly, subjective estimates and present value calculations of future cash flows were used to estimate the fair values. Determining&#13;
E     future cash flows for fair value estimation is subjective and imprecise, and minor changes in assumptions or methodologies may materially&#13;
affect the estimated values. The excess or deficit resulting from the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair values presented&#13;
does not necessarily reflect the realizable values since the Corporation generally holds loans and other financial instruments to maturity&#13;
with the aim of realizing their recorded values.&#13;
c     The estimated fair values reflect the interest rate environments as of June 30, 2000 and June 30, 1999, but not the effects of interest rate&#13;
i     fluctuations for any period preceding or following those dates. In different interest rate environments, fair value results can differ significantly,&#13;
especially for certain fixed rate financial instruments. Reasonable comparability of fair values among financial institutions is not likely, because&#13;
of the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates that must be made in the absence of secondary market prices. This&#13;
z     lack of objective pricing standards introduces a greater degree of subjectivity and volatility to these derived or estimated fair values. Therefore,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
while disclosure of estimated fair values of financial instruments is required, readers are cautioned in using these data for purposes of evalu-&#13;
ating the financial condition of the Corporation. The fair values of the individual financial instruments do not represent the fair value of the&#13;
Corporation taken as a whole.&#13;
The methodologies used and key assumptions made to estimate fair values as of June 30, 2000 and June 30, 1999 are summarized below.&#13;
Liquid assets-The estimated fair value of the time deposits and the trading and available for sale securities portfolios are based on quoted&#13;
market prices and the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
Derivative financial instruments-Fair values for interest rate and currency swaps were derived by determining the present value of estimated&#13;
future cash flows using appropriate discount rates. Fair values for covered forwards were derived by usitig quoted market forward exchange    35&#13;
rates. Fair values for commodity-indexed contracts and call options were based on pricing models. Fair value for put warrants was based on&#13;
quoted market prices.&#13;
Loan investments and commitments-The Corporation, which extends loans to entities operating in the private sector in its developing&#13;
member countries, generally has not sold its loans from the portfolio and there is no comparable secondary market. Fair values for fixed rate&#13;
loans and loan commitments were determined using a discounted cash flow model based on a discofint rate comprising the fixed rate loan&#13;
spread plus the year end estimated cost of funds. Since rates on variable rate loans and loan commitments are generally reset on a quarterly or&#13;
semiannual basis, the carrying value adjusted for credit risk was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. The Corporation also holds&#13;
options to convert loans into equity of certain of its investee companies. Fair values of these conversion options are based on quoted market&#13;
prices or other calculated values of the underlying equity investment.&#13;
Equity investments-Fair values were determined using market prices where available, put option prices, book values or cost, certain of which&#13;
were discounted based upon management's estimate of net realizable value. Where market prices were not available or alternate valuation&#13;
techniques were not practical, cost was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. Management's estimate of fair value takes into consid-&#13;
eration the relative illiquidity and volatihty, as well as the overall business constraints, in the emerging markets in which the Corporation invests.&#13;
Borrowings and commitments-Fair values were estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on rates representing the Corporation's&#13;
estimated year end cost to raise funds with similar terms and remaining maturities.&#13;
Estimated fair values of the Corporation's financial instruments are summarized below (US$ millions):&#13;

NOTE N-CURRENCY POSITION&#13;
The Corporation conducts its operations for its loans, time deposits and securities and borrowings in multiple currencies. The Corporation's&#13;
policy is to minimize the level of currency risk by closely matching the currency of its assets (other than equity investments and quasi-equit y&#13;
investments) and liabilities by using hedging instruments. The Corporation's equity investments in enterprises located in its developing&#13;
member countries are typically made in the local currency of the country. As a matter of policy, the Corporation carries the currency risk&#13;
of equity investments and quasi-equity investments and funds these investments from its capital and retained earnings.&#13;

NOTE O-SEGMENT REPORTING&#13;
For management purposes, the Corporation's business comprises two segments: client services and treasury services. The client services segment&#13;
primarily consists of lending and equity investment activity. The treasury services segment consists of funding, liquid asset management,&#13;
management of currency and interest rate risks, and assisting clients in asset and liability management.&#13;
The assessment of segment performance by senior management indudes net income for each segment, return on assets, and return on capital&#13;
employed. The Corporation's management reporting system and policies are used to determine revenues and expenses attributable to each&#13;
segment. Consistent with internal reporting, administrative expenses are allocated to each segment based largely upon personnel costs and&#13;
segment head counts. Transactions between segments are immaterial and, thus, are not a factor in reconciling to the consolidated data.&#13;
The accounting policies of IFC's segments are, in all material respects, consistent with those described in note A, "Summary of Significant&#13;
Accounting and Related Policies."&#13;
An analysis of the Corporation's major components of income and expense by business segment for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and&#13;
1998 is given below (US$ millions):&#13;

future benefit changes and economic conditions. Changes in these assumptions will impact future benefit costs and obligations. The weighted&#13;
average assumptions used in determining expense and benefit obligations are as follows (%):&#13;

NOTE Q-SERVJCE AND SUPPORT PAYMENTS&#13;
The Corporation obtains certain administrative and overhead services from IBRD in those areas where common services can be efficiently&#13;
provided by IBRD. This includes shared costs of the Boards of Governors and Directors, and other services such as communications, internal&#13;
auditing, administrative support, supplies and insurance. Payments for these services are made by the Corporation to IBRD based on negotiated&#13;
fees, chargebacks and allocated charges, where chargeback is not feasible. Expenses allocated to the Corporation for the year ended June 30,&#13;
2000, were $16 million ($17 million-year ended June 30, 1999; $14 million-year ended June 30, 1998).&#13;
39&#13;
NOTE R-EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE&#13;
During the year ended June 30, 1998 the World Bank Group revievwed the status of the accounts of the Retired Staff Benefits Plan and the&#13;
Post Employment Benefits Plan and determined that the plan assets and liabilities did not qualify for off-balance sheet accounting. At June 30,&#13;
1998 the assets and liabilities were recorded on IBRD's balance sheet.The Corporation included a receivable from IBRD of $72 million in&#13;
receivables and other assets relating to its share of these postretirement benefits net assets, representing a prepaid postretirement benefits cost.&#13;
Also during the year ended June 30, 1 998, after completing a five-year experience study, IBRD reduced the health care cost rates used in&#13;
calculating the funded status of these benefits plans. This resulted in a reduced accrued liability of the plans at June 3 0, 1998.&#13;
These changes resulted in income to the Corporation for the year ended June 30, 1998 of $46 million. Of this amount, $16 million related&#13;
to the cumulative effect for prior periods on retained earnings at June 30, 1997, and $18 million represented the Corporation's allocation&#13;
of the reduction in accrued liability. These amounts, totaling $34 million, have been included in effect of accounting change in the income&#13;
statement. The balance of income of $12 million has been included in increase in share of net assets held for postretirement benefits in the&#13;
income statement.&#13;
NOTE S-TRUST FUNDS&#13;
The Corporation uses the services of IBRD to administer funds on behalf of donors which are restricted for specific uses, including technical&#13;
assistance, feasibility studies and project preparation, global and regional programs and research and training programs. These funds are placed&#13;
in trust and are not included in the Corporation's assets. The responsibilities of the Corporation are to arrange for services generally not&#13;
otherwise provided by it including full project implementation and procurement of goods and services. The distribution of Trust Fund&#13;
assets by executing agent is as follows (US$ millions):&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2000 : building business, creating opportunity
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This is the International Finance
            Corporation (IFC) annual report for FY2000, which outlines
            its increased gross approvals, led by a record of new
            investments in Sub-Saharan Africa; the realization of its
            second-highest-ever annual net income; and, the significant
            resurgence in commercial bank lending through its
            syndications program. However, during the period IFC also
            felt the push of reformers, and critics, and the effects of
            a changing market place. Responsive to changing needs, IFC
            looks at how to bridge the digital divide which threatens
            the developing world; at ways to strengthen domestic
            financial markets; at how to address basic infrastructure;
            and, at how to improve access to health care and education,
            as well as how to improve environmental, and social
            sustainability. IFC's single largest sectoral focus
            remains the financial sector, which amounted to 46 percent
            of new approvals, though strategic priorities were further
            refined to align its activities with market realities, by
            building business, and creating job opportunities. Moreover,
            it has pioneered corporate environmental and social
            responsibility, by moving the private sector to actively
            promote economic development. IFC activities during FY2000
            are presented, and, through case studies, shows the range of
            projects, by region and investment type. Finally, IFC's
            financial review describes performance, funding management,
            capital earnings, as well as risk management, and credit risk.
