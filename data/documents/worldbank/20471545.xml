ï»¿ANNEX I OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
Program Description&#13;
EC- World Bank Partnership Program for Europe and Central Asia&#13;
I.    Rationale and Scope of the Programmatic Trust Fund&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The European Commission and the World Bank Group share a common vision of&#13;
building competitive and sustainable economies and in reducing poverty and social exclusion.&#13;
These goals are outlined in the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) (2014-2020) -&#13;
"The EU as a global player". It is designed to allow the Union to fulfill its responsibility both&#13;
at global level and in its immediate neighborhood, and to help safeguard global public goods,&#13;
i.e., fighting poverty and promoting democracy, peace, stability, and prosperity. The MFF&#13;
also supports the Commission's new approach, the "Agenda for Change", to focus EU aid in&#13;
fewer sectors supporting, inter alia, good governance and creating inclusive and sustainable&#13;
growth. In this context, a continued constrained growth and a tight fiscal environment in the&#13;
Neighborhood, Western Balkans, Turkey, and Central Asia make it important for the&#13;
European Commission and the World Bank Group to coordinate policy advice, where&#13;
appropriate, and to allocate their resources in the region in the most strategic and effective&#13;
way possible. As a result, the European Commission and the World Bank have begun to&#13;
interact more directly by means of a programmatic trust fund (established in 2011) to support&#13;
the Europe 2020 Agenda, as well as indirectly with the World Bank engaging directly with&#13;
individual European countries on projects that are financed by the governments entirely or in&#13;
part by EU External Action Instruments and other EU resources, such as the Structural Funds,&#13;
the Rural Development Fund or the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). These&#13;
experiences continue to deepen the mutual appreciation for the complementary competencies&#13;
of each institution.&#13;
Areas of joint cooperation and the World Bank advisory activities envisioned under the&#13;
Program&#13;
2.    The Commission and the World Bank Group agree that more direct interaction would&#13;
be beneficial to both institutions and through them to the countries. This applies particularly&#13;
to the provision of analytical, advisory and knowledge services, capacity and institution&#13;
building, and technical assistance, but also to projects executed by respective governments.&#13;
The Commission has already demonstrated its interest in specific analytical projects to be&#13;
carried out by the World Bank, which provide guidance for investments in the long-term&#13;
prosperity and stability of the EU's neighborhood and support the reform process in those&#13;
countries preparing for EU membership. Areas of common interest are regularly discussed&#13;
and refined at sub-regional country day meetings between the services of the European&#13;
Commission and the World Bank Group that are held on an annual basis. These meetings&#13;
have focused on the Eastern Neighborhood, Central Asia and Pre-Accession countries, and&#13;
therefore cover many EU external action instruments, including: the Instrument for Pre-&#13;
Accession Assistance (IPA), the European Neighborhood Instrument (ENI), the Development&#13;
Cooperation Instrument (DCI), the Partnership Instrument (PI), and Macro-Financial&#13;
Assistance (MFA).&#13;
3.    In the Western Balkans, the EC has expressed interest in the World Bank providing&#13;
analytical and technical support both at regional and national level to: (i) improve the&#13;
regulatory framework for innovative and high-potential enterprises; (ii) help improve public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿financial management and public administration reform; (iii) provide support to the private&#13;
sector; (iv) improve competitiveness and the investment climate; (v) strengthen policies and&#13;
institutions governing employment and social inclusion, (vi) tackle environmental issues and&#13;
the impact of climate change; (vii) investigate energy efficiency and security of supply; and&#13;
(viii) to provide technical assistance on Roma issues.&#13;
The type of activities which will be carried out under this Programmatic Trust Fund&#13;
will include Bank executed analytical services and technical assistance, as well as recipient&#13;
executed technical assistance and capacity building activities.&#13;
EU-REPARIS, KESPS and A WSSSPS&#13;
4.    The initial contribution to this programmatic trust fund will finance the 'Road to&#13;
Europe - Program of Accounting Reform and Institutional Strengthening (EU-REPARIS), an&#13;
activity which supports the implementation of corporate financial reporting frameworks in&#13;
line with the EU acquis communautaire in the countries of Southeast Europe with a view to&#13;
promoting enhanced availability, transparency and reliability of financial information. An&#13;
additional contribution to this programmatic trust fund will finance KESPS and AWSSSPS&#13;
Activities (please see Annexes 1.A and 1.B for the detailed description).&#13;
Other potential activities under the Programmatic Trust Fund&#13;
5.    The EC and the World Bank plan to continue to collaborate on a number of themes&#13;
under all aspects of EU External Action, including in areas related to economic, social and&#13;
institutional development of the beneficiary countries, innovation capacity and investment&#13;
readiness of enterprises, investment climate, venture capital, licensing, public finance&#13;
management, sector approach and social inclusion.&#13;
II.   Development Objective&#13;
6.    The objectives of the Programmatic Trust Fund are to assist the beneficiary countries&#13;
in: (i) developing policies/strategies and institutional capacity to adopt and implement the&#13;
acquis communautaire in policy areas where the World Bank Group's expertise is particularly&#13;
relevant; (ii) informing strategies, policies and financing; and (iii) to enhancing the economic&#13;
development of beneficiary countries to help the further convergence of incomes with EU&#13;
member states. Depending on the beneficiary country or countries and the type of activity to&#13;
be supported, one, two or all of the objectives will apply.&#13;
III.  Geographic scope&#13;
7.    The Programmatic Trust Fund covers all countries in Europe and Central Asia, except&#13;
EU member states, complying with the eligibility criteria of the respective EC instrument&#13;
financing the activity.&#13;
IV.   Governance&#13;
8.    The World Bank shall prepare and approve annual work plans and budgets for both the&#13;
Program and the individual activities and discuss them with the EC. It will also discuss the&#13;
thematic and geographic focus of the Program as well as the progress on activities undertaken.&#13;
During these discussions, the Bank will update the EC on the implementation progress and&#13;
provide the EC with a proposed list of activities for financing under the Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX L.A OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
Description of the KESPS Activities to the carried out by the World Bank under the&#13;
Program and KESPS Contribution&#13;
1.    Objectives. In the framework of, and in line with, the Program and the KESPS&#13;
Contribution, the objective of the KESPS is to assist the Initial Beneficiary Country to:&#13;
(a) enhance the diagnostic capacities and knowledge to develop and implement&#13;
evidence based policy framework for education, training and skills development; and&#13;
(b) develop the analytical underpinnings that would begin to inform a sound&#13;
education, training, skills and employment interventions.&#13;
2.    Purpose. These activities aim to provide the analytical basis that would inform a&#13;
sound education, training and employment interventions in close coordination with the&#13;
Government of Kosovo*, and contribute to the design of future Government of other&#13;
donor supported operations.&#13;
3.    Specific activities to be carried out under the KESPS Activities:&#13;
(a) Carrying out a Household Skills Measurement Survey with Full Literacy&#13;
Assessment Survey:&#13;
Carrying out the household survey through use of a package of already developed&#13;
inputs (core questionnaires, interviewer manuals, basic training document, data entry&#13;
program, and literacy exercises); to collect information on individuals' cognitive, non-&#13;
cognitive and workplace skills, as well as background information on their family&#13;
structure, general health, education and employment history.&#13;
(b) Providing technical support for survey implementation and overall technical&#13;
report preparation.&#13;
Providing technical support for: (i) implementing the survey using instruments already&#13;
developed by the World Bank and adjusted to the country context; (ii) analyzing the&#13;
household survey data; and (iii) preparing the overall technical report.&#13;
4.    Context&#13;
In order to improve the quality and speed up the programming and implementation of the&#13;
multi-country assistance, the Strengthening European Integration Facility (SEI) allocates&#13;
resources for preparation of strategic documents and projects and to address horizontal&#13;
challenges faced by the administrations of the beneficiaries on the path towards EU accession.&#13;
The fulfillment of EU requirements entails an increasing number of qualified experts,&#13;
competent civil servants and necessitates expertise and EU knowledge in judicial, economic&#13;
and political matters. Furthermore, specific administrative structures and management&#13;
systems should be established or strengthened to satisfy the requirements of the EU acquis in&#13;
* This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ&#13;
Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿a number of areas. Such assistance is also required in rolling out the sector approach in the&#13;
enlargement countries.&#13;
The Initial Beneficiary Country has high unemployment and low labor market&#13;
participation, especially among the youth and females. Unemployment was estimated at&#13;
30.9 percent in 20121, the highest in South East Europe. Youth unemployment is especially&#13;
high, at over 55 percent. Every year, approximately 30,000 new jobseekers enter the labor&#13;
market, while current economic growth generates no more than around 15,000 new jobs per&#13;
year. As a result, only about 10 percent of the active youth population is working, and this&#13;
falls to less than 5 percent for females.&#13;
Over a third of young Kosovars are neither in education nor in employment. Even for&#13;
those with higher education, prospects appear to be worsening, with some evidence&#13;
suggesting that increasing numbers of those with university degrees are unemployed. In 2012,&#13;
15.6 percent of degree-holders were unemployed, possibly reflecting a mismatch between&#13;
education and demand for skills in the labor market. At 63 percent of the population&#13;
(including discouraged jobseekers), the total inactivity rate is the highest in Europe, with&#13;
female inactivity rate standing at 82 percent.&#13;
Skills shortages and unemployment are among the key challenges that better education&#13;
and training can help to tackle. The World Bank 2009 Enterprise Survey found that an&#13;
inadequately educated workforce was a major or very severe obstacle for over 14 percent of&#13;
firms surveyed.2 Large and fast-growing firms3 were particularly likely (around 25 percent) to&#13;
report this to be an obstacle, suggesting that skills shortages may be among the reasons&#13;
constraining private sector growth. At the same time, unemployment remains a severe&#13;
problem for many segments of the population. Over 60 percent of workers without any&#13;
schooling were unemployed according to the 2012 Labor Force Survey (LFS), over double&#13;
the national rate. Workers with levels of education at upper secondary or below also had&#13;
unemployment levels above the national average. Those with vocational training fared better&#13;
in the labor market than their colleagues with general secondary education.&#13;
Kosovo's* young population presents some opportunities, challenges and risks.&#13;
Kosovo*'s population is the youngest in Europe, with an average age of about 26. Kosovo*&#13;
does not face the fiscal and economic pressures resulting from an aging population, a problem&#13;
faced by many other eastern European countries. A well-trained labor force could be a&#13;
comparative advantage and a key resource for economic growth. This however requires a&#13;
policy focus to ensure that quality of education and the skills the education and training&#13;
system offers are in line with the labor market needs. Investing in proper education and&#13;
training will help workers to find employment, increase their tax contributions, and give firms&#13;
access to the skills they need. It will also boost the productivity of the workforce and help&#13;
Kosovo* to move into the modern economic sectors that will increase growth.&#13;

average) over the previous three years.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿In this regard, understanding the skills (cognitive, non-cognitive and technical) in the&#13;
adult population, and their relation to labor market outcomes, is critical to&#13;
understanding better what skills are required by the labor market. There is considerable&#13;
consensus that labor demand is low and this also explains the weak labor outcomes, and as&#13;
such, skills are indeed an important, but not the only dominant factor examining the labor&#13;
market outcomes. Kosovo* is undergoing important changes, and how well the labor market&#13;
adjusts to these changes - and to what extent the transformation occurs - will be largely&#13;
determined by the skills available in the workforce. As such, the STEP HH survey will help&#13;
to more clearly state the role of skills in labor market outcomes and their link to productivity,&#13;
employment, and growth - which is central to the agenda of the government of Kosovo* and&#13;
to the policy dialogue within the context of European Union agenda.&#13;
5.    Link with other programmes&#13;
The Bank is well positioned to lead the activities proposed under this Project, as it has played&#13;
a critical role in supporting the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare and the Ministry of&#13;
Education, Science and Technology on issues of education, employment and labor issues. The&#13;
Bank is also implementing the EU funded Western Balkan's Employment and Social&#13;
Inclusion Programmatic Trust Fund which aims at making growth in the region more&#13;
inclusive by providing opportunities for all to obtain the skills and experiences necessary to&#13;
succeed in the labor market while assisting the poor in meeting their basic needs and&#13;
transitioning into sufficiently paid jobs. Through this Project, support is provided to Western&#13;
Balkan's countries in developing and increasing their capacities for the implementation of&#13;
South East Europe (SEE) 2020 Strategy, which represents Western Balkan's countries&#13;
response to Europe 2020 and includes targets for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The&#13;
World Bank is, and will continue to, work closely with other donors active in the sector. The&#13;
Bank is a full member of the donors group for education. The proposed project will build on&#13;
past analytical and policy work completed by the Bank and other donors, and will help&#13;
consolidate on-going efforts into a consistent policy message for the Government. In the&#13;

ï»¿ANNEX I.B OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
Description of the A WSSSPS Activities to be carried out by the World Bank under the&#13;
Program and A WSSSPS Contribution&#13;
1.    Objectives. In the framework of, and in line with, the Program and the AWSSSPS&#13;
Contribution, the objectives of the AWSSSPS are to assist the Second Beneficiary&#13;
Country in the development of key implementation instruments of the Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Sector Strategy and Master Plan; and provide targeted technical&#13;
assistance to one regional utility.&#13;
2.    Purpose. These Activities aim at providing a platform for an effective and efficient&#13;
water sector-based support by the European Union and other donors.&#13;
3.    Specific activities to be carried out under the AWSSSPS Activities&#13;
(a)   Developing key implementation instruments to improve the quality and&#13;
effectiveness of investments in the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector&#13;
Strategy and Master Plan such as (i) preparing a draft sector financing strategy&#13;
for identifying key principles to assure the financial sustainability of water&#13;
supply and sanitation services; (ii) preparing a strategic paper on the long-&#13;
term institutional framework for wastewater services including the long term&#13;
vision for sustainable wastewater management in Albania; and (ii) carrying out&#13;
policy discussions and consultations on the key implementation instruments&#13;
developed under 3(a) (i) and (ii) of this Annex.&#13;
(b)    Providing targeted technical assistance to the Durres Water Utility including&#13;
on its quality control, commercial and financial aspects with a view to&#13;
improving its capacity and serving as a model in the sector.&#13;
4. Context&#13;
In order to improve the quality and speed up the programming and implementation of the&#13;
multi-country assistance, the Strengthening European Integration Facility (SEI) allocates&#13;
resources for preparation of strategic documents and projects and to address horizontal&#13;
challenges faced by the administrations of the beneficiaries on the path towards EU accession.&#13;
The fulfillment of EU requirements entails an increasing number of qualified experts,&#13;
competent civil servants and necessitates expertise and EU knowledge in judicial, economic&#13;
and political matters. Furthermore, specific administrative structures and management&#13;
systems should be established or strengthened to satisfy the requirements of the EU acquis in&#13;
a number of areas. Such assistance is also required in rolling out the sector approach in the&#13;
enlargement countries.&#13;
Despite substantial water resource endowments (8,600 m3 per capita) Albania faces&#13;
severe shortcomings in the Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) sector, including (a)&#13;
severe underinvestment in infrastructure in the past decades, (b) high Non-Revenue Water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿(NRW), (c) poor cost-recovery and low metering coverage, (iv) limited duration of water&#13;
supplied per day, (v) utility-scale inefficiencies and (c) limited levels of wastewater collection&#13;
and treatment. At the same time, there are over 50 utilities in the country serving a population&#13;
of just over 3 million people, outlining the need for utilities to find ways to share limited&#13;
technical and financial resources.&#13;
The country is a long way from achieving European Union (EU) standards in the sector.&#13;
Only around 44 percent of connections are metered (EU standard: 100 percent), the duration&#13;
of water supplied per day stands at just over 11 hours (EU standard: 24 hours) and NRW - due&#13;
to technical and managerial losses - stands over 60 percent (EU standard: below 20 percent).&#13;
Only about half of all wastewater is collected centrally, and much less is actually treated,&#13;
resulting in significant environmental and economic impacts.&#13;
The current state of the WSS sector is a severe constraint to growth and a fiscal burden&#13;
to the Government. Durres, the second largest city in the country and the main driver of&#13;
tourism receipts, is currently experiencing a water supply deficit of 70 liters per capita per day&#13;
(47 percent of actual demand) which is a constraint to private investment and to the further&#13;
development of the tourism industry. In addition, millions of dollars are spent every year by&#13;
the Albanian Government in operational subsidies to cover unpaid electricity bills as utilities&#13;
are not held accountable. Meanwhile, households continue to make private investments to&#13;
cope with the limited duration of water supply.&#13;
A particular concern is the provision of sustainable wastewater management services. In&#13;
its effort to improve environmental conditions, foster coastal tourism and move towards EU&#13;
standards, Albania has recently built, with donors support, 8Waste Water Treatment Plants&#13;
(WWTP), potentially covering more than 25 per cent of the country's urban population.&#13;
However, the cost of operating them exceeds the capacity of water and sewerage utilities,&#13;
which were facing a challenging financial situation already prior to the construction of&#13;
WWTPs. Furthermore, because wastewater management is a new area in Albania, there is&#13;
limited technical capacity in the country to properly manage those plants. As a result, several&#13;
of the plants are currently idle and in an institutional vacuum and long-term operational&#13;
arrangement are unclear.&#13;
At this stage, the Government of Albania has identified the need to complement the&#13;
existing policy instruments with concrete implementation instruments focused on how to&#13;
finance and organize the provision of water and sanitation services.&#13;
5.    Link with other programmes&#13;
Alongside other donors, the Bank has provided a steady stream of investments and&#13;
institution building measures to help improve water and sanitation services. Recently,&#13;
the Bank assisted the Government in the preparation of a National Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation Sector Strategy for the 2010-2017. The Government has put tenets of European&#13;
water legislation such as cost recovery, proper wastewater management and efficient use of&#13;
natural resources, at the core of the Strategy, which aims at developing proper policies and&#13;
committing sufficient resources to improve the provision of water supply and sewerage&#13;
services in Albania, and to consistently move towards compliance with standards. A national&#13;
master plan was subsequently prepared with the support of the German KfW, which outlined&#13;
and prioritized capital investment needs up to 2040 for the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿6.    Implementation arrangements&#13;
The AWSSSPS Activities will be implemented by the World Bank in collaboration with&#13;
the Second Beneficiary Country, the European Commission's delegation in the Republic&#13;
of Albania and other donors.&#13;
