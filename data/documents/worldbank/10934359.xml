Carrington, Timothy&#13;
In the first four months of calendar year 1999, the World Bank Institute Knowledge and&#13;
Products (WBIKP) Division offered three renditions of its Core Course on Economics and&#13;
Business Journalism. Participants were print and broadcast journalists. The objectives of the&#13;
courses were to improve participants' understanding of key economic concepts and to equip&#13;
them with practical strategies for covering economic, business and development issues. The&#13;
course contents for each offering were similar, with relevant national or regional emphasis&#13;
added. All courses were organized and led by task manager Timothy Carrington of WBIKP.&#13;
&#13;
The first course was held in Bogor, Indonesia from February 21-25, 1999, with twenty&#13;
Indonesian journalists participating. The second offering was held in Islamabad, Pakistan&#13;
from March 1-4, 1999, with 13 participants from Pakistan. The third offering took place in&#13;
Bamako, Mali from April 19-23, 1999, with a total of 31 participants from Francophone Africa&#13;
(Mali, Senegal, Niger, Guinea, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, Togo and Burkina Faso).&#13;
&#13;
WBIKP and the WBI Evaluation Unit conducted Level 1 (participant reaction) evaluations of&#13;
the courses. At their conclusions, each participant was asked to complete a participants'&#13;
feedback questionnaire. Questionnaires used for the courses in Indonesia and Pakistan were&#13;
identical with one exception. That is, the questionnaire for the Indonesia course asked two&#13;
additional questions. Both questionnaires included two sections. The first section asked&#13;
participants to rate their satisfaction with the course content and delivery. A 5-point Likert&#13;
type scale that ranged from 1 (minimum/lowest) to 5 (maximum/highest) was used for each&#13;
question. The second section asked the respondents to rate the quantity or intensity of&#13;
various aspects of their respective courses. For this second section, respondents were to&#13;
rate the quantity or intensity as either "insufficient," "somewhat insufficient," "adequate,"&#13;
"somewhat excessive," or "excessive." "Adequate" was the optimal response in this second&#13;
section. The Mali questionnaire had only one section. It asked 14 questions on the extent to&#13;
which respondents were satisfied with the course content and delivery. The same 5-point&#13;
Likert type scale was used. Two questions from the questionnaire for the course in Mali&#13;
matched the questions on the questionnaires used for the courses in Indonesia and&#13;
Pakistan, but the other 12 questions were different.&#13;
&#13;
Response rates to the questionnaire were high for all three courses: 19 of 20 (95%)&#13;
participants in Indonesia; all 13 of the participants in Pakistan; 26 of 31 (84%) participants in&#13;
Mali. Following is a summary of the evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  A key indicator of course performance is the question that asks participants to rate&#13;
        the overall usefulness of the course. On this indicator results were high, particularly&#13;
        from Pakistani participants. Overall usefulness of the course received a mean score&#13;
        of 4.62 out of 5.0 (N=13) from participants in the Pakistan course. In addition, 92.3%&#13;
        of participants in the Pakistan course gave either a score of "4" or "5" to the question&#13;
        of usefulness. No respondents in the Pakistan course rated the usefulness with a&#13;
        score of "1" or "2." The participants in the Indonesia course gave a mean score of&#13;
        3.53 (N=19). In a similar question the participants in Mali were asked to rate the&#13;
        extent to which the course was a worthwhile use of their time. They responded with a&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 mean score of 3.72 (N=25).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lEnsuring that the content of the course is appropriate to the audience is a key&#13;
 element of a course's success. All three sets of course participants found the course&#13;
 content highly relevant to their work. On the question of relevance of the activity to&#13;
 participants' current work or functions the mean scores were as follows: Pakistan&#13;
 course, 4.58 (N=12); Indonesia course, 4.42 (N=19); and Mali course, 4.35 (N=26). In&#13;
 addition, participants in the Pakistan and Indonesia courses were asked to rate the&#13;
 relevance of the course to their future (work/functions). Again, participants rated this&#13;
 highly. The Pakistan course participants gave this item a mean score of 4.69 (N=13)&#13;
 and the Indonesia course participants gave it a mean of 4.26 (N=19). Participants in&#13;
 Mali were not asked this last question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe lowest marks received respectively for both the Indonesia and Pakistan courses&#13;
 involved the question of the extent to which participants acquired information that was&#13;
 new to them. Participants in Indonesia gave this a mean score of 3.16 (N=19) and&#13;
 participants in Pakistan gave it a mean score of 3.38 (N=13). Yet when asked about&#13;
 the usefulness of the information that they acquired, the mean scores were higher.&#13;
 Indonesian participants gave a mean score of 3.53 (N=19). Meanwhile, Pakistani&#13;
 participants gave a mean score of 4.77 (N=19), the highest mean score from that&#13;
 questionnaire. Even though participants from the two courses felt that they had&#13;
 acquired a slightly-above average amount of information that was new to them, the&#13;
 scores for this second question indicate that they nevertheless found this information&#13;
 to be useful and above or much-above average.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lOverall ratings for the Mali course's performance in different areas were above average.&#13;
 Given that the scale's theoretical mid-point is 3.0, the mean for all items was above&#13;
 that point. Scores ranged from a low of 3.32 (extent to which you could produce a&#13;
 thorough, analytical article or broadcast on your country's fiscal policy, including&#13;
 reasons for some major changes in the government budget, N=25) to a high of 4.35&#13;
 (extent to which the course has been relevant to your work, N=26).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lFor almost every question asking participants in the Pakistan and Indonesia courses&#13;
 to rate the quantity or intensity of various aspects of the courses, the vast majority of&#13;
 responses were "adequate" (the optimal response). In particular, the Pakistan course&#13;
 participants gave very high marks on this section in that only one question had 50%&#13;
 "adequate" ratings and the other nine questions had 67% to 100% of responses&#13;
 marked as "adequate." The question that received the lowest percentage of&#13;
 "adequate" responses in both courses involved the depth of treatment of the issues.&#13;
 For the Pakistan course, six of 12 (50%) responses were "adequate," five of twelve&#13;
 (41.6%) were "somewhat insufficient" and one of 12 (8.3%) was "excessive." In&#13;
 addition, five Pakistani participants noted in written comments that they would have&#13;
 liked more specialized or focused training on economic or financial issues. In the&#13;
 Indonesia course, seven of 19 participants (36.8%) thought the depth was "adequate,"&#13;
 another seven of 19 (36.8%) thought that depth was "somewhat insufficient," and five&#13;
 of 19 (26.3%) found the depth "somewhat excessive." Participant dissatisfaction with&#13;
 the depth of treatment is not necessarily a poor reflection on the course and may be&#13;
 attributed to other factors. Some reasons for dissatisfaction could be participant&#13;
 desire for less or more focus, a course that is too long or short, or varying levels of&#13;
 participant knowledge or experience with course content. For future courses,&#13;
 organizers might consider offering a formal "needs-assessment" or test to participants&#13;
 before or at the start of the course. This type of tool would gauge participant needs&#13;
 and desires, allowing course organizers to adjust the course accordingly.&#13;
