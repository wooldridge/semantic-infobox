1.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
A.    Economic and Social Setting&#13;
1.1    Guyana embarked on a radical economic reform in mid- 1988, fundamentally reversing the thrust&#13;
of its policies of the preceding twenty years. The change was propelled by a protracted period of&#13;
economic and social decline, caused by excessive reliance on state-led economic activity and highly&#13;
interventionist policies. Past mismanagement left the country in dire straits, with widespread poverty&#13;
and dilapidated economic and social infrastructure. Per capita GNP of US$525 (1994) is among the&#13;
lowest in the Western Hemisphere, and despite the forgiveness of much of its bilateral component, public&#13;
external debt, at US$2,500 per capita, is one of the world's highest. Guyana needs sustained economic&#13;
growth to recover lost ground. Recovery from decades of emigration of many of its most skilled citizens&#13;
will take much longer.&#13;
1.2    Guyana's Economic Recovery Program, which was spearheaded by stabilization and adjustment&#13;
programs with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, has been very successful, despite&#13;
limited amounts of incremental external assistance. Within three years of commencing the program, the&#13;
economy responded strongly to the improved macroeconomic management and incentive framework.&#13;
Real GDP rose by an average of 8% during the four years 1991-1994. Except for bauxite, traditional&#13;
industries have largely recovered, and gold mining and forestry have grown rapidly with large inflows of&#13;
foreign investment. The government's current account deficit has reached manageable levels, inflation&#13;
has been reduced from 100% in 1991 to 16% in 1994, and the exchange rate has stabilized.&#13;
1.3   In a context of limited budgetary resources, inefficient use of these resources, and public control&#13;
of all education services, Guyana's education indicators fell from the highest to among the lowest in the&#13;
Caribbean. Learning, as measured by examination outcomes, fell sharply, student drop-out rates&#13;
increased, textbooks and other teaching aides disappeared from schools, and teacher quality fell as&#13;
qualified and trained personnel left a sector in which salaries declined sharply.&#13;
1.4   These conditions continued to worsen in the initial phase of the recovery program, but the new&#13;
democratically elected Government of 1992 placed new priority on the social sectors and increased&#13;
budget allocations accordingly. Resources for the sector, however, continue to be low in spite of&#13;
severely dilapidated infrastructure, a depleted teaching force and diminished institutional capacity. In&#13;
this context, there is a continuing need for major external assistance.&#13;
B.    Overview of the Education Sector&#13;
1.5    Enrollment. Guyana's education system consists of: (a) preschool education of I to 2 years&#13;
(for 4- and 5-year olds); (b) primary schooling of 6 years duration; (c) secondary schooling of 3 to 5&#13;
years; and (d) higher education (comprising the University of Guyana, several technical institutes, a&#13;
teacher training college and a small "sixth form" program in seven secondary schools). School&#13;
attendance is compulsory from ages six to fourteen and a half years.&#13;
1.6    Currently, primary and secondary education gross enrollment rates are estimated to be about&#13;
95% and 60%, respectively, which compare favorably with other Caribbean countries (91% and 55% on&#13;
the average, respectively). The secondary education enrollment rate is high for a low-income country&#13;
and comparable to the average of upper-middle income countries (54%). Data from 1990 show that of&#13;
the 90 to 95% of primary students who continue on to the seventh grade, 86%, 77%, 64% and 30%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
reached grades 8, 9, 10 and 11, respectively. Enrollment in grades 10 and 11 might be even higher but&#13;
for children streamed out of the system (para. 1.19). A household survey taken in 1992-1993 indicates&#13;
that the very high demand for places has probably not changed materially since 1988, but with the&#13;
growth of the informal economy, the labor market benefits of staying in school to receive low-quality&#13;
schooling are likely to decline drastically in the future for large numbers of young people. An early&#13;
indicator of possible decline is that only 63% of the enrolled students regularly attend class (1988 data).&#13;

1.7     Sector Finance. Guyana's economic problems have had serious consequences for the funding&#13;
of education. Between 1984 and 1992, government recurrent education expenditure declined from 18%&#13;
to 4%, partly due to heavier debt service obligations, but mostly due to reallocations to other categories&#13;
of expenditure. The government that came into power in 1992 has increased fiscal effort for education&#13;
significantly. Real education expenditures for 1994 were 42% higher than for 1992 (Table 1.1).&#13;
Nonetheless, education was allocated only 6% of recurrent expenditures in 1994, a level still far below&#13;
comparator countries in the Caribbean and elsewhere (Annex I, Table 6). Educational expenditures were&#13;
distributed in 1994 as follows: primary (33%), secondary (25%), post-secondary (20%) and nursery and&#13;
other (22%).&#13;
1.8     The years of neglect have left the sector badly weakened, and substantial injections of resources&#13;
are needed to revitalize it. Resource constraints have had their greatest impact on teacher salaries, which&#13;
fell below the estimated poverty level in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Low salaries and poor working&#13;
conditions led to teacher flight, leaving schools understaffed and staffed by unqualified and untrained&#13;
teachers. By 1990, approximately 40 percent of teachers at the primary and secondary level were in the&#13;
untrained or unqualified categories. Recognizing the importance of better teacher compensation, the&#13;
new government financed a large, real increase in teacher salaries at the beginning of 1994 -&#13;
approximately 70% increase for most grades and somewhat higher increases in some senior grades.&#13;
1.9     Reduced education finances have also meant that less resources have been allocated to the&#13;
purchase of textbooks and other leaming materials. With the exception of those texts recently distributed&#13;
to students in the upper secondary stream' in the first three years, classrooms are typically devoid of&#13;
these important materials. During the past two decades, capital expenditures have been minimal and the&#13;
educational plant at all levels is now severely dilapidated. Present efforts will not rapidly reverse this&#13;
'i.e., in the General Secondary Schools (para. 1.17).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
dire situation. Education's share of budgeted capital expenditures for 1994 - 7% - was at about the same&#13;
low level as recurrent expenditures. More than 90% was donor-financed and virtually none was used for&#13;
secondary schools.&#13;
1.10   Performance. Guyana's education system suffers both from poor quality and efficiency. Just&#13;
how poor is the performance is difficult to assess in the absence of an objective evaluation program.&#13;
Despite the strong emphasis on testing in Guyana (there are five main national or international tests&#13;
between ages 11 and 16), only the international test taken at age 16 (Caribbean Examination Council -&#13;
CXC) is comparable over time. Taken by less-than-20% of Guyanese sixteen-year-olds who are&#13;
considered to be best-prepared, this exam shows very poor performance compared to students from other&#13;
Caribbean countries. In 1992 , even with widespread private tutoring, only 10% of those sitting the exam&#13;
passed the English test and 18% the Math . This compares with the average passing rates for 1 0 other&#13;
Caribbean countries in 1989 of 36% in English and 33% in Math (Annex 1, Table 7). The scores of&#13;
Guyanese takers were also on a downward trend of 1-2% per year over the decade prior to 1992. These&#13;
poor and down-trending results are a crude but clear summary indicator of the deteriorated state of&#13;
Guyana's primary and secondary schools. If the best students perform at this level, how much worse off&#13;
must the majority be.&#13;
1.11   Internal Efficiency. Data on internal efficiency is sparse, but repetition and dropout rates are&#13;
reputed to be low in primary school. Low dropout is roughly confirmed by census data. At the&#13;
secondary level, repetition is also reputed to be low, but a crude estimate for the upper stream for 1990&#13;
indicates that repetition may be much higher however - in the 20-25% range. Attendance is also known&#13;
to be a large problem throughout the primary and secondary years. Incomplete 1988 school survey data&#13;
indicate that on an average day somewhat less than two-thirds of the secondary students were in&#13;
attendance (Annex I, Table 9). The secondary attendance problem was generally more severe in the&#13;
lower streams and the higher grades. One anomaly in this picture, however, was the contrast between the&#13;
attendance rate for girls in and out of Georgetown. Outside of Georgetown, upper-stream secondary girls&#13;
had the best attendance rate among all streams and genders (79%); in Georgetown, by contrast, they had&#13;
the worst rate (50%). This disparity in female attendance rates could indicate the particular influence of&#13;
gender-specific employment opportunities in the urban labor market.&#13;
1.12   Governance of Primary and Secondary Education (Annex II). In 1985, education functions at&#13;
the primary and secondary levels were decentralized under a broad decentralization program initiated in&#13;
1980. The present government has retained this structure, under which, except for Georgetown, school&#13;
administration and finance are controlled by regional administrations in Guyana's 10 regions.&#13;
Georgetown's schools are directly administered by the Assistant Chief Education Officer (ACEO),&#13;
Georgetown but support functions are provided by the central Ministry of Education and Cultural&#13;
Development (MEC). MEC's chief responsibilities are to set broad sector policy; maintain a national&#13;
curriculum; develop, procure and distribute textbooks and instructional materials; coordinate national&#13;
examinations; and monitor education quality nationwide. The regional administrations are appointed&#13;
bodies consisting of a political council (the Regional Democratic Council) containing representatives&#13;
from the major political parties in proportion to regional election results and a Regional Executive&#13;
Officer (RExO) reporting to it. The latter has responsibility for the delivery of various health,&#13;
agriculture, public works and education services.&#13;
1.13   In most regions, deputies in the functional areas - in education, the Regional Education Officers&#13;
(REdOs) - carry out the day-to-day management of the sector and are charged with carrying out national&#13;
policies, which are determined by the respective national ministries, as well as regional policies, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
are determined by the regional administrations. In their management of regional school systems, REdOs&#13;
receive administrative and financial guidance from the RExOs.&#13;
1.14   MEC has significant power over appointments, including those of the REdOs. REdOs are civil&#13;
servants appointed by the Public Service Commission (PSC) after consultation with MEC. MEC then&#13;
assigns REdOs to the various regions. Similarly, school principals and assistant principals are appointed&#13;
by the separate Teachers' Service Commission (TSC), instead of the PSC, in consultation with MEC.&#13;
Except for temporary-teacher appointments, which are made directly by the regional administrations,&#13;
MEC sets the qualification criteria for teachers at all levels, who are also appointed through the TSC.&#13;
Teachers are paid according to a national pay scale determined by the government and revised&#13;
periodically.&#13;
1.15   Budget administration in education is weak in Guyana. Although some regional administrations&#13;
are more systematic than others, as a rule, rational criteria for resource allocation are absent. At the&#13;
central government level, allocation of budgets to regions for education and other decentralized services&#13;
has been, until very recently, negotiated directly between MOF and regional administrations with little&#13;
direct input from MEC and the other line ministries. Under the new practice, MEC is responsible for&#13;
reviewing and clearing budget submissions from regional administrations before they are sent to MOF.&#13;
However, MEC lacks appropriate instruments and adequate human resources to carry out its new tasks.&#13;
As a result, the budgetary influence of the regional administrations is still decisive. MEC has little scope&#13;
to fund initiatives designed to accomplish national educational priorities, except in Georgetown where&#13;
budget negotiations with MOF are carried out by the deputy permanent secretary of MEC. This results&#13;
in widely differing levels of resources provided to individual regions (Annex III, Figure 2). For instance,&#13;
secondary schools in Region 3, on one side of Georgetown, received about G$8,900 per student in 1994,&#13;
while those in Region 4, on the other side, received G$6,500 per student. MEC has some influence over&#13;
regional administrations by means of donor or government financial resources for texts, capital&#13;
expenditure and special projects, as well as technical resources in areas such as training and curriculum.&#13;
1.16   Shortcomings in the structure and operation of the decentralized system have severely weakened&#13;
educational management and contributed to declining education quality and to inequities in educational&#13;
opportunities. Because the decentralized system still lacks appropriate instruments to hold regional&#13;
administrations accountable to the MEC and its clients (students, parents and local citizens), regional&#13;
education planning can be divorced from both national education policies and local concerns. In this&#13;
setting, budgeting and management capacity at the school level have been greatly weakened. Although&#13;
vestiges of an orderly system of school management remain, school principals are unable to employ&#13;
sound planning and budgeting practices in a context where it is unclear what resources the school will&#13;
receive in a given year and according to what schedule.&#13;
C.    Main Issues in Secondary Education&#13;
1.17   Introduction. Secondary schooling is offered in three streams - General Secondary Schools&#13;
(GSS), Community High Schools (CHS), and secondary departments of primary schools (Primary Tops-&#13;
PT). Entrance to the different secondary streams is determined by a student's performance on the&#13;
Secondary School Entrance Examination (SSEE) taken in the final year of primary school. Students&#13;
scoring in the top 40 percent generally gain entrance to GSSs where the curriculum ostensibly prepares&#13;
them to take the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) examinations and possibly the General&#13;
Certificate of Education (GCE), a British-based examination, in their fifth year. Lower scoring students&#13;
gain entrance to the less prestigious four-year CHSs, where the last two years' curriculum is more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
vocationally oriented. CHS students take the locally administered Secondary School Proficiency&#13;
Examination (SSPE) in the third and fourth years. Students who do not take the SSEE, often because&#13;
they exceed the age limit for the test, are only eligible to attend the secondary departments of primary&#13;
schools- "primary tops", which provide three years of secondary schooling. Other students, whose&#13;
parents believe it is impractical for them to travel to a more distant CHS, also enroll in the primary tops.&#13;
Movement among the three streams is minimal; high CHS/PT scorers on the SSPE given at the end of&#13;
year 3 are eligible to transfer to a GSS school and ultimately take the CXC examinations, but they must&#13;
repeat the third year in the GSS. Very few students - less than 50 in the 1990 school year - currently&#13;
make the transfer. Those not transferring are streamed out of the secondary system after three years in&#13;
the primary tops and after four years in the CHS.&#13;
(1)    Equity and Access&#13;
1.18   The establishment of the CHS system in 1975 was designed to give access to relevant vocational&#13;
secondary education to children who were not admitted into public secondary schools or who could not&#13;
afford the fees of non-government schools. The latter were subsequently absorbed into the public school&#13;
system. Thus, the CHS system was intended to increase access for economically or academically&#13;
disadvantaged primary graduates and did accomplish this to a certain extent. Ironically, the CHS/PT&#13;
system is now the main impediment to large numbers of children gaining access to relevant skills and&#13;
credentials for employment.&#13;
1.19   There are several reasons for this. First, because of low mobility to the GSS stream, children&#13;
who attend CHS and PT schools, with few exceptions, do not have the opportunity to study core&#13;
academic subjects beyond the 9th grade and thereafter are unable to obtain CXC passes in these subjects,&#13;
which in Guyana are virtually the only secondary credentials now recognized in the labor market. Nor,&#13;
in most cases, do they have the opportunity to qualify for admission to the University of Guyana.&#13;
Because instruction in CHS/PT schools either stops at or does not include significant academic emphasis&#13;
beyond the 9th grade, they are also poorly positioned to obtain any future locally-administered secondary&#13;
credential that might gain acceptance in the labor market.&#13;
1.20   Second, adequate resources are not available to the CHSs and PTs. Effective pre-vocational&#13;
secondary education, as traditionally conceived in Guyana and elsewhere, with adequately equipped&#13;
shops and lower student-teacher ratios, typically requires two-to-three times the resources that effective&#13;
general secondary education requires. Although available financial analysis has not established how&#13;
large the financial gaps among the streams are, the CHS/PT streams appear even more starved of&#13;
resources than the GSS system. Deteriorated or non-existent facilities and lack of experienced&#13;
vocational teachers allow only a rudimentary implementation of the pre-vocational curriculum.&#13;
1.21   Third, even adequately financed pre-vocational education may not prepare students effectively&#13;
for the labor market. International experience has shown that students in pre-vocational programs&#13;
typically have poorer labor market prospects, including access to training provided by employers, than&#13;
general secondary school leavers.&#13;
1.22   In theory, the SSEE assigns the less academically-inclined students to prevocational programs&#13;
more appropriate to their abilities. However, high-stakes tests like the SSEE are poor instruments for&#13;
student evaluation. Many of the primary school children who are streamed into the CHS and PT schools&#13;
undoubtedly have the ability to succeed in a general secondary curriculum or could develop it. Some are&#13;
simply poor test takers or merely had a bad test day. Some are late developers. Others are over-age and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
were not allowed to take the test. Finally, a number were displaced by less able children (in SSEE terms)&#13;
whose families could afford to pay for after-school tutoring.&#13;
1.23   While unification of the secondary system would ultimately be the most effective method of&#13;
reducing the large inequities in Guyana's secondary education system, significant changes in curriculum,&#13;
student mobility and finance would each help materially in assuring equitable access to education and&#13;
employment opportunities. Specifically, a fully implemented common curriculum in the three streams,&#13;
quality improvements in the CHS/PT schools, increased transfers from these schools to GSS schools in&#13;
all grades, provision for studying academic subjects in CHS/PT schools, and equitably distributed school&#13;
finance would remove many of the most glaring inequities.&#13;
(2)    Quality Issues&#13;
1.24   Poor student achievement in all secondary streams is a consequence of interrelated deficiencies&#13;
in school curricula, teacher and school-administrator training, textbook and instructional-material&#13;
availability, and school equipment and infrastructure. Low performance levels in secondary schools is&#13;
also a consequence of weak primary-school preparation.&#13;
1.25   Curriculum. The curriculum for all secondary streams in Guyana is supposed to be based on&#13;
the CXC syllabus for each subject area. Although National Fourth Form Achievement Test syllabi do&#13;
exist, in practice, no national curriculum guides have been distributed to teachers, and little attention has&#13;
been given to the idea of a national curriculum in recent years. Few CHS/PT students receive the fourth&#13;
and fifth year instruction in the CXC syllabi that is given in the GSSs. In the CHSs and PTs, teachers use&#13;
eclectic sources for instructional guidance. Only the five-year GSS course attempts to actually prepare&#13;
students to take the academic CXC examinations. The results cited above indicate a conspicuous lack of&#13;
success. Instruction for the first three years in the GSSs is now based on texts recently produced by&#13;
MEC with UNDP financing and, where available, outdated NCERD curriculum guides and CXC syllabi.&#13;
Teacher curriculum guides corresponding to the texts have not been widely distributed. In most cases,&#13;
overall achievement levels in the CHS/PT schools are even more inferior to those of the GSS schools&#13;
than the differing ability levels of students would suggest, particularly in the critical areas of Language&#13;
Arts and Math. Major variations among schools exist in instructional time allocated for these core&#13;
subjects. While prevocational subjects are a prominent element in the curriculum of the CHS/PT schools&#13;
(GSS schools also have compulsory prevocational studies), the results of the SSPE, taken at the end of&#13;
the third year by CHS/PT students, indicate that few students have significant vocational competencies to&#13;
compensate for serious basic education deficiencies.&#13;
1.26   Prior to the distribution of the GSS texts for grades 7-9, the overall approach of the curriculum in&#13;
all streams had been based largely on rote learning by drill and copying into exercise books, which were,&#13;
along with chalk, in short supply in many schools. Developing a common curriculum with a multi-level&#13;
approach for a student population with varying learning skills, especially in Language Arts and Math, is&#13;
a challenge now urgently facing Guyana.&#13;
1.27   The Teaching Force. Approximately 60% of the teachers in both the GSSs and CHSs are either&#13;
university graduates (16%) or have completed a course of teacher training (44%), with the graduates&#13;
concentrated in the GSS schools. No information is available about the teachers in PT schools. Massive&#13;
emigration of skilled Guyanese has hollowed out the teacher corps as well as other institutions in&#13;
Guyana. Although Guyana does not face inefficiencies in teacher utilization (teacher-student ratios of&#13;
about 1:35), high teacher turnover rates and the decline in general educational standards have markedly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
reduced the average skill level of secondary teachers compared to fifteen years ago. Data on teacher&#13;
qualifications do not distinguish the level of training and many of the graduates and trained teachers in&#13;
secondary schools have only primary training. Thus, few have the academic background necessary for&#13;
the secondary subjects they teach. As a consequence, there is very low productivity in most classrooms,&#13;
particularly in the CHS and PT schools, in terms of teaching and learning vis-a-vis the content and skills&#13;
indicated by the formal curriculum.&#13;
1.28   The recent large real salary increase for teachers (para. 1.8) has improved teacher morale&#13;
somewhat, but salaries that are still low compared to private and foreign employment, dilapidated,&#13;
unsafe, unsuitable school buildings, lack of teaching materials and other supplies, high student and&#13;
teacher absenteeism, and limited access to in-service training continue to make it very difficult for the&#13;
government to attract and retain skilled teachers. A TS17 principal, for instance, now typically earns&#13;
about US$3,200 per annum, including allowances. This is only about US$1,200 more than a recently&#13;
hired, trained, graduate teacher earns and just a few hundred dollars more than a secondary school&#13;
graduate with three CXC passes earns in the private sector. Consequently, steps need to be taken in the&#13;
future to improve teachers' working conditions in the schools and to enhance their teaching skills.&#13;
1.29   Lacking training in pedagogy and in the subjects they teach, most teachers are unable to engage&#13;
students in active learning or cover anything approaching the appropriate curriculum. Visits to&#13;
classrooms indicated a very passive approach to teaching - students sitting at desks copying exercises or&#13;
problems the teacher had written on the board and the teacher sitting at the desk observing the students or&#13;
doing other work. Very little lecturing, explaining, demonstrating or discussing subjects with the class or&#13;
circulating among students to check on student progress was taking place. Further, the time spent&#13;
learning is significantly less than the actual time period allocated for the class.&#13;
1.30    Good supervision and technical support are key elements in curriculum reform. At present,&#13;
however, teachers and schools receive inadequate support. Technical support should be provided as part&#13;
of routine supervision by the principal or department head, by education officers in the regional offices,&#13;
and by trained resource teachers. Generally this is not happening. The lack of supportive supervision&#13;
contributes to the low observed productivity in the classroom.&#13;
1.31   For all the reasons cited, major attention needs to be paid to upgrading the teaching force. Care&#13;
in recruitment needs to be made to reduce teacher turnover and, thus, to retain the results of costly in-&#13;
service training.&#13;
1.32   Textbooks and other Teaching Resources. Except for the new texts used in GSS grades 7-9,&#13;
teacher and student resources are in very short supply in all schools, particularly in the CHS/PT schools.&#13;
The scarcity of resources is also acute in prevocational subjects of the curriculum: industrial arts,&#13;
technical drawing, sheet metal, wood working, etc. The MEC/UNDP text book project produced a&#13;
complete series of textbooks for grades 7-9 in eight subject areas using course outlines based on CXC&#13;
syllabi. However, the new textbooks are not being used in CHS and PT schools. Production runs are too&#13;
small even for effective GSS use, and MEC considers them too advanced for CHS and PT students. For&#13;
the most part, instruction in the CHS/PT schools is based primarily on the use of exercise books. MEC&#13;
needs to identify appropriate textbooks for CHS and PT students either by adapting the existing&#13;
textbooks or identifying others. The lack of texts in CHS/PT schools, together with their availability in&#13;
GSS schools, is a major educational and equity concern. An emergency supply project, partly funded by&#13;
the Government of Canada in 1990 for five years in response to the acute shortage in the prior years, has&#13;
relieved the situation temporarily. However, sustainable budgetary provision of educational supplies of&#13;
all kinds needs to be provided by the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
1.33   School Facilities and Equipment. School facilities are generally dilapidated, overcrowded,&#13;
unsafe and lacking furniture, laboratory equipment, shop and other instructional equipment. A large&#13;
percentage of school buildings are constructed of wood. A 1992 MEC survey of secondary school&#13;
facilities, with about three-quarters of the schools responding, indicated that the median age of school&#13;
buildings was 37 years and that 55% of the GSS buildings and 45% of the CHS buildings were in very&#13;
poor condition and in need of immediate replacement or rehabilitation due to extensive damage to roofs,&#13;
foundations, stairs and floors. Eighty-six percent of the schools cited serious roof problems. To assess&#13;
the full seriousness of the situation, an up-to-date, complete facilities survey by independent consultants&#13;
is urgently needed.&#13;
1.34   Another facilities problem related both to original school design and to overcrowded conditions&#13;
is that most schools lack single-classroom space, where the teacher and class can engage in vocal, lively&#13;
learning activities without disrupting other classes. Large open space classroom areas with individual&#13;
classes divided by chalkboards seriously constrain active, student- centered instruction.&#13;
1.35   Finally, school security presents a critical facilities problem with important community relations&#13;
overtones. Virtually all schools in Guyana have experienced very serious security problems and have&#13;
lost many of their few movable assets and even structural elements from the school buildings. The worst&#13;
of these crises occurred in 1990, when failure to negotiate national security contracts led to the&#13;
withdrawal of virtually the entire security force. Major deficiencies in perimeter fences and other&#13;
building security devices and the lack of secure storage space need to be corrected if improved learning&#13;
supplies and equipment are to be retained. Even more important is the development of a supportive&#13;
community environment to make it difficult for thieves to operate with impunity.&#13;
(3)    Secondary School Finance&#13;
1.36   The GSS and CHS secondary streams absorbed 25% of total government expenditure on&#13;
education (Table 1.1). No estimate is available for the expenditure on primary tops, but if unit cost were&#13;
one-half of that for the other streams, the percentage for secondary education would be 29%. In&#13;
percentage terms, this is within the desirable range according to international norms, but it should not&#13;
obscure the central financial fact that Guyana's annual expenditure per secondary student remains at a&#13;
very low level - an average of US$65 per student in GSS/CHS - and even less (US$48 per student) when&#13;
expenditures on President's College and CXC subsidies are removed (Table 1.2).&#13;
1.37   Despite data limitations which preclude a detailed analysis, unit expenditures are significantly&#13;
less in CHS than in GSS, and substantially less in the PT stream even than in the CHS stream. This is&#13;
probably true even when the 25% of total combined GSS and CHS expenditures on President's College&#13;
and CXC subsidies, which primarily benefit some GSS students, are disregarded. There is also&#13;
considerable variation among schools within all streams. Informal inspection suggests that the ranges of&#13;
school unit costs in both CHS and GSS overlap considerably, with a number of CHS schools receiving&#13;
unit allocations above large numbers of GSS schools. Within the GSS stream, seven schools, such as&#13;
Queens College in Georgetown, offer small higher education courses to a total of only about 150&#13;
students. These two-year, "sixth-form" courses are designed to prepare students for the GCE A-Level&#13;
examination, which is required for entry into the University of the West Indies and UK (but not US)&#13;
universities. Undoubtedly, these sixth-form programs and the Grade 7-1 1 programs in the same schools&#13;
have much higher then average unit costs. GSS schools at the bottom of the financial ladder, conversely,&#13;
receive unit financial allocations well below the GSS average. Similarly, the least-well-financed CHS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
and PT schools receive allocations below the average for their streams and far below the national&#13;
average. Correcting this inefficient and inequitable situation will require timely school-level financial&#13;
data, rational budget procedures (para. 1.38), and resistance to special pleading at the regional level.&#13;
1.38    As a concomitant of more equitable budgeting among schools, the allocation of educational&#13;
finance among the regions also needs to be rationalized. At present, there are substantial, hard-to-justify&#13;
variations in average expenditure per secondary school student among the regions. For instance, Regions&#13;
4 (outside of Georgetown) and 6 received only 67% as much per student as Regions 2 and 3 in 1994&#13;
(Table 1.2). Budget allocation procedures and budget negotiations should be based primarily on standard&#13;
unit costs for both equity and efficiency reasons.&#13;

1.39    Budget procedures should also be flexible enough to deal with the special needs of schools&#13;
serving remote regions. Undoubtedly, the western border regions (1,7,8,9), whose schools service vast,&#13;
sparsely populated interior regions, require higher unit allocations, especially when residential facilities&#13;
are involved. There has not been any budget analysis based on differential unit costs to indicate whether&#13;
unit allocations, which were 71%  above the national average in 1994, are appropriate. Appropriate&#13;
budget formulas for schools serving remote regions would not only systematize allocations to these&#13;
regions but could also be used to assure equitable finance to schools serving remote populations in&#13;
several other regions.&#13;
(4)      Organization and Management&#13;
1.40    The organization of secondary education in Guyana is complex. The regional structure&#13;
dominates line functions in administration and educational-finance (para. 1.12), except in Georgetown,&#13;
where MEC assumes the line functions of the regional administrations. The regional education officers&#13;
(REdOs) do not usually have deputies for secondary education; instead, they have subordinate district&#13;
education officers (DEOs) and district education supervisors (DESs), who, in turn, deal with primary and&#13;
secondary schools within their districts. However, no regional or even district officers are charged with&#13;
overseeing secondary education exclusively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
1.41   Despite the dominance of line functions by the regional administrations, MEC does have several&#13;
significant line roles in personnel selection, curriculum decisions, and investment in the regions. Once&#13;
staffing needs are determined by the regional administrations and affirmed in the budget process, for&#13;
instance, MEC through the Chief Education Officer (CEO) and the deputy chief education officer for&#13;
administration (DCEO/Admin) has de facto control of all permanent appointments, including those of the&#13;
REdOs, DEOs, school principals and non-temporary teachers.2 MEC also specifies the curricula to be&#13;
taught in all secondary schools. Lastly, MEC typically decides where and how donor-funded and other&#13;
special projects will be administered and provides funds for them through its budget.&#13;
1.42   MEC's role in staff functions in the regions is considerably larger than its role in line functions,&#13;
and it has wide responsibility for the functions listed in para. 1.12 At present, MEC administers&#13;
secondary education-through three officers, with each secondary stream having its own assistant chief&#13;
education officer (ACEO). There are ACEOs for GSS, CHS and primary (including primary tops), who&#13;
report to the DCEO/Admin. In light of Guyana's goals of unifying the secondary education system,&#13;
MEC needs to institute new management arrangements to more effectively deal with such questions as a&#13;
common curriculum, criteria for rational resource allocation, mobility among the streams, equity in the&#13;
development of teaching materials, and improvement in MEC lines of authority to secondary schools in&#13;
the regions. The line administrative structure in secondary education in the regions is also surprisingly&#13;
paralleled in the administration of Georgetown schools, which are administratively fully under MEC.&#13;
Here, an ACEO for all levels of Georgetown schools reports directly to the DCEO/Admin, and the three&#13;
ACEOs handling staff functions for secondary education have no line authority over him or her.&#13;
1.43   Equally important to the reform of secondary education at the national and regional levels will be&#13;
the decentralization of budget authority and accountability to school principals. Once school budgetary&#13;
allocations are determined on the basis of systematic, rational criteria, principals need to be made&#13;
responsible for designing and carrying out efficient educational programs that are consistent with&#13;
national policies, for producing effective student learning outcomes, and for skillfully administering&#13;
school budgets.&#13;
1.44   Public service reform is high on the Government's agenda and is being supported by the IDA&#13;
under the Public Administration Project. Enhancing the ability to retain key technical and managerial&#13;
staff is an objective of public management reform generally. In the area of education, MEC has found it&#13;
extremely difficult to retain key educational resource staff who are essential to the implementation of&#13;
educational reform in the areas of curriculum, training, assessment, and learning resources. A key issue&#13;
of educational management is therefore how to recruit and retain skilled personnel in these areas.&#13;
D.    Government Sector Objectives and Strategy&#13;
1.45   The Government has assigned priority to the development of its human resources, noting that the&#13;
continued expansion of the productive sector and the country's ability to compete in international&#13;
markets will depend on a well-educated labor force and that rehabilitation of the education sector will be&#13;
required to achieve this.&#13;
1.46   In the education sector, the Government policies aim at: (a) strengthening the institutional&#13;
capacity and increasing the efficiency of publicly financed education (b) enhancing the quality of&#13;
2 Dejure appointment power is vested in the Teacher Service Commission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
services delivered in the basic education cycle, which consists of primary education and the first three&#13;
years of secondary level education; (c) ensuring a more equitable distribution of educational&#13;
opportunities and resources, and (d) utilizing budgetary resources more efficiently. The Government&#13;
believes that the highest returns to educational investments can be obtained from investments in the basic&#13;
education cycle and has sought to focus resources accordingly.&#13;
1.47   The MEC has drawn up a Five-Year Education Plan, which identifies these priorities and&#13;
specifies how these objectives will be addressed. This document provides a basic framework within&#13;
which the proposed project can support education improvement and reform. The Government has&#13;
already started a process of education reform at the primary level through the IDB-supported Primary&#13;
Education Improvement Programme (PEIP). The Government also applied for Project Preparation&#13;
Facility for the proposed project in 1994.&#13;
E.    IDA's Role and Strategy&#13;
1.48   IDA involvement in the proposed project is fully consistent with the overall Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) for Guyana, which was discussed at the Board on December 15, 1993. The CAS&#13;
identified, among others, the following objectives: (a) to assist the Government in refocusing and&#13;
strengthening the public sector to improve delivery of public services, especially human resources&#13;
development; (b) to play a catalytic role in developing sector strategies and policies as well as in&#13;
providing framework for mobilizing resources from other donor agencies; and (c) to support the&#13;
rehabilitation of education facilities; and (d) to complement the PEIP.&#13;
1.49  In line with the above mentioned objectives, the SIMAP project (financed by C2358, US$10.30&#13;
million, Project ID: GY-PA-7254 with IDB cofinancing), a social-fund-type project designed to mitigate&#13;
the effects of macro-economic adjustment, has supported a variety of activities since 1993, including the&#13;
preparation of a medium-term strategic plan for the education sector (IDA-financed component) and the&#13;
rehabilitation of primary education facilities (IDB-financed component). The Bank Group also&#13;
supported, in April, 1994, a national workshop on human resource development. This provided a forum&#13;
for discussion of MEC's strategy plan for the sector by interested parties, including teachers, principals,&#13;
representatives of regional administrations, teachers' unions and the general public.&#13;
1.50   The project would fully incorporate the objectives identified by the CAS and complement&#13;
ongoing IDA assistance by: (i) developing measures to improve the quality and efficiency of lower&#13;
secondary education and testing them at a limited number of schools in order to gain acceptance before&#13;
expanding to the rest of the system, which is highly complex; (ii) supporting rehabilitation and repair of&#13;
schools; and (iii) enhancing the Government's ability to design, plan for, and implement sustainable&#13;
education reforms.&#13;
F.    Lessons Learned From Past Operations In the Country/Sector&#13;
1.51   The proposed project would be the third education project financed by the World Bank Group in&#13;
Guyana. The First Education Project (CO139:US$2.9 million + L0583:US$2.9 million) implemented in&#13;
the early 1970s engineered the diversification of the secondary school program as well as the&#13;
strengthening of guidance and testing services. On the other hand, the Second Education Project (C0544:&#13;
US$4.0 million + LI 106: US$8.00 million) from the mid-70s to the early-80s was only partially&#13;
successful. One of the objectives was to establish the CHS system in order to replace PTs. Although the&#13;
project established 8 model CHSs, they were not in operation by the time of loan closing when over 30%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(US$2.6 million) of the IBRD loan amount was canceled. The Second Education Project also suffered&#13;
from the lack of counterpart funds, weak managerial capability, difficulties in procuring architectural&#13;
services and delays in implementing civil works.&#13;
1.52   An IDB-financed PEIP has disbursed only about US$7 million of the US$44.6 million loan since&#13;
the agreement was signed in 1991. This is mainly because: (i) the PEIP's civil works component had to&#13;
be almost completely redesigned; and (ii) the project implementation unit has been virtually&#13;
independent--both physically and administratively--from MEC, and the synergy between the two has&#13;
been severely limited.&#13;
1.53   Experience from the past thus suggests that projects in Guyana are likely to experience slow&#13;
implementation and disbursement, mainly due to weak institutional capacity of public agencies and the&#13;
Government's strict procurement review procedures (para. 3.35). Also in the past, projects often required&#13;
comprehensive reformulation, suffering from overly complex design and over-dependence on&#13;
conditionalities for control. On the other hand, projects which are simple in design, with well focused&#13;
priorities, and flexible in implementation would have the best chance of success. There would also be a&#13;
need to integrate project administration closely into the existing organizational structure in order to build&#13;
institutional capacity and local ownership, thus increasing the chance of sustaining the project's impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2.    THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Project Objectives&#13;
2.1    The primary objective of the project is to assist the Government to initiate a long-term, multi-&#13;
phased education reform program to improve quality, relevance, equity and efficiency to secondary&#13;
education in Guyana. More specifically, the project would aim to: (i) develop measures to improve the&#13;
quality and efficiency of lower secondary education and test them at a limited number of schools in order&#13;
to gain acceptance before extending the reform to the rest of the system; (ii) improve the school&#13;
environment by supporting rehabilitation and repair of schools; and (iii) enhance the ability of national&#13;
and regional institutions to design, plan for, and implement sustainable education reforms.&#13;
B.    Project Description&#13;
2.2    The project would have the following three components: (i) Educational Program Quality; (ii)&#13;
School Environment; and (iii) National and Regional Institutional Strengthening.&#13;
(1)    Educational Program Quality Component (US$2.5 million, 15% of baseline cost)&#13;
2.3    A key goal of educational reform in Guyana is to provide all children with an effective and&#13;
relevant basic education, irrespective of the school stream they are attending. However, to achieve this&#13;
goal, Guyana needs to identify cost-effective improvements which can be implemented on a nation-wide&#13;
basis. The objectives of this component are to: (i) introduce decentralized, cost-effective, sustainable,&#13;
integrated, school-based quality improvements; and (ii) develop, test and implement new and more&#13;
relevant multi-level common curricula in four core subjects for the lower secondary level (Grades 7-9).&#13;
For these purposes, twelve pilot schools have been selected by the Government from all streams and&#13;
several geographic regions. At each school, a School Improvement Plan (SIP), incorporating school-&#13;
based management concepts, would be prepared and implemented in accordance with guidelines and&#13;
budget advice provided by MEC and the regional administrations (Annex V). The new curricula would&#13;
be tested in pilot schools, revised accordingly and new curriculum guides would eventually be&#13;
distributed to all secondary schools in Guyana.&#13;
2.4    Pilot schools would receive project inputs in the form of: (i) newly developed multi-level&#13;
curricula in four core subjects for Grades 7-9; (ii) increased availability of textbooks and other&#13;
instructional materials and equipment; (iii) in-service training of teachers for delivering the curriculum&#13;
effectively and efficiently; (iv) training and support of principals in effective school management,&#13;
including educational leadership and community mobilization. In addition, in light of the severely&#13;
dilapidated condition of many of the pilot schools, rehabilitation of school facilities and acquisition of&#13;
furniture are supported under the School Environment component (para. 2.23) in order to adequately&#13;
support the implementation of the improved educational program.&#13;
2.5    Support of School Management. Each pilot school principal would prepare a school&#13;
improvement plan (SIP) and revise it annually on a rolling three-year basis. It would contain, inter alia:&#13;
(i) a description of the school's student population and teaching staff, including quantitative and&#13;
qualitative information; (ii) objectives for student learning outcomes and the rationale for them, (iii)&#13;
priority areas to be improved in educational quality and infrastructure with quantitative and qualitative&#13;
targets; (iv) strategies to take advantage of project inputs in improving identified areas; (v)&#13;
implementation strategies and sequencing, (vi) strategies to effectively involve and obtain support from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
teachers, students, parents and the community, (vii) negotiated arrangements for greatly increased&#13;
opportunities for students to move the pilot school and accessible schools offering upper-secondary&#13;
education (if this is not available in the pilot school), and (viii) a detailed budget for the use of&#13;
discretionary funds following broad MEC guidelines. In formulating their SIPs, pilot schools would be&#13;
required to seek input from students, parents, community leaders, and employers. School and&#13;
community participation would be formalized for each school in a small-membership School&#13;
Improvement Advisory Committee (SIAC), which would participate in preparing the SIP and would&#13;
approve it before submitting it for further approval by the REdO and the ACEO/Secondary.&#13;
2.6    The SIP would be prepared in accordance with MEC's SIP Guidelines, which would be drawn up&#13;
and kept current by the ACEO for Secondary Education after widespread consultation at national&#13;
regional, school and community levels. In assuming this responsibility, the ACEO/Secondary would&#13;
receive policy guidance from the Reform Management Team (RMT; para. 3.20) comprising senior&#13;
government officials, technical assistance from the Project Secretariat in the form of a school-based&#13;
management specialist (para. 2.7) and budgetary guidance from the DPS/MEC, the regional&#13;
administrations and the Ministry of Finance. The SIP Guidelines would describe, inter alia: (i) what to&#13;
be included in a SIP (objectives, strategies, time-based implementation plans, management&#13;
arrangements, base-line and progress indicators, etc.); (ii) how to establish a SIAC and formulate a SIP;&#13;
(iii) the SIP cycle (formulation, approval, implementation); (iv) roles and responsibilities of the&#13;
MEC/Project Secretariat and the Regional Administrations in providing assistance to schools, and how a&#13;
school can obtain such assistance; (v) reporting requirements and supervision arrangements. The MEC&#13;
has submitted the first draft SIP Guidelines for IDA's review in late November, 1995. At negotiations,&#13;
the Government provided a revised draft for IDA's review, and agreed on further revisions to be&#13;
made before the guidelines are finalized (para. 3.40 (h)). Furnishing of the SIP Guidelines&#13;
acceptable to IDA is a condition of effectiveness (para. 3.41 (c)).&#13;
2.7   In order to assist the pilot schools in developing and implementing their SIPs, the project would&#13;
provide school management and participatory management specialists to: (i) brief the pilot school&#13;
principals in participatory-planning techniques, (ii) assist them in assembling their SIACs and preparing&#13;
planning workshops at each school and (iii) help them prepare their SIPs. The school management&#13;
specialist would also assist the MEC in updating the SIP Guidelines. Besides providing the specialists,&#13;
the Project Director and his/her staff would give the schools continuous hands-on technical assistance in&#13;
developing their SIPs and would approve their SIPs for use of project funds prior to submission to higher&#13;
levels.&#13;
2.8   In order to assist school-level initiatives, the project's counterpart funds would set aside a small&#13;
discretionary fund for each school to be operated and accounted by the school principal. The annual&#13;
allocation to each school for this fund would be equivalent, at the outset of the project, to no less than&#13;
US$3 per student. The fund could be used to purchase goods and services (i.e., library books, un-&#13;
budgeted maintenance, equipment replacement) in accordance with the SIP Guidelines. The pilot&#13;
schools would specify in their SIPs what these funds and any other school-controlled funds would be&#13;
used for and how they would improve learning outcomes. At negotiations, the Government agreed&#13;
that it will provide annual budget support, equivalent to at least US$3.00 per student on the&#13;
average, to pilot school discretionary funds for uses specified in their approved SIPs as part of the&#13;
Government's counterpart funds for the project. (para. 3.40 (a)).&#13;
2.9    Training of Principals, Deputy Principals and Department Heads. The effectiveness of&#13;
school managers in designing and justifying financial support for school improvement programs would&#13;
be one of the key elements in the success of these programs. One important criterion for the selection of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
pilot schools has been the quality of leadership of the principal. Further training in school management,&#13;
including financial and information management, educational leadership, communications skills, and&#13;
community relations would also be an essential element in the success of the school improvement&#13;
programs. The project would support training seminars specifically directed at school administrators.&#13;
School administrators would join regional and MEC administrators in more general management training&#13;
(para. 2.27), and participate in teacher training as appropriate (para. 2.18). In addition, school&#13;
administrators would receive direct training in the process of developing their school SIPs and carrying&#13;
out the project. They would receive direct guidance from the Project Director and his staff, from the&#13;
specialists in school-based management and participatory management (para. 2.5), educational finance&#13;
(para. 2.26), and from the curriculum (para. 2.14) and supervision teams (para. 2.20).&#13;
2.10   Introduction of a Common Curriculum. To improve efficiency and equitable access to quality&#13;
basic education, the project would support the development of a common curriculum for Grades 7-9 and&#13;
its implementation in the pilot schools. The common curriculum would use multi-level and cross-&#13;
curricular approaches that presuppose that students of varying skill levels can pursue a common core of&#13;
knowledge in most subject areas (Annex VI). The new curricula would be developed in conjunction with&#13;
the identification of suitable, off-the-shelf supporting texts and other curricular materials, where&#13;
possible. The project would provide technical assistance to the MEC's National Centre for Educational&#13;
Resources Development (NCERD). As the existing NCERD is severely understaffed, the project would&#13;
assist the NCERD in staffing up for the proposed project work program. Also to assist NCERD in&#13;
recruiting and retaining qualified education specialists, the project would provide supplemental&#13;
allowance from the counterpart funds for selected posts, as listed in Annex VIII.&#13;
2.11   Formulation of a common curriculum in four core subjects would be carried out in the following&#13;
sequence: (i) language arts and mathematics; and (ii) science and social studies. Development and&#13;
implementation of the curriculum guides would be on a two-year cycle, whereby the first year would be&#13;
devoted to writing the guide, followed in the second year by test piloting in the project schools. Input&#13;
from students, parents, teachers and employers would be sought at various stages. Although only the&#13;
pilot schools would receive intensive, continuous curriculum support under the project, the curriculum&#13;
guides would be finalized following test-piloting and distributed to all secondary schools in Guyana. By&#13;
the end of Year 5 of the project, all four core subjects would have been written, piloted and distributed.&#13;
2.12   The project would not directly finance a new pre-vocational curriculum. Technological subject&#13;
matter would be included in the science curriculum. In addition, the project would support the&#13;
exploration of alternatives such as the resource and technology curricula being used elsewhere in the&#13;
Caribbean through workshops and study tours. The project would be prepared to finance the cost of&#13;
implementing such curricula at a select number of pilot schools on an experimental basis.&#13;
2.13   The structure and content of the common curriculum would be related to the curriculum and&#13;
achievement objectives developed through the UNICEF-funded Minimum Levels of Attainment project.&#13;
For each subject, the curriculum review would: (i) examine the scope, sequence and articulation of&#13;
content and skills from primary level through secondary school; (ii) review appropriate off-the shelf texts&#13;
and other curricular materials that might form a cost-effective basis for further curriculum development&#13;
and specification of instructional methodologies; (iii) select instructional methodologies and alternative&#13;
textbooks and instructional materials for all grades and levels, and (iv) identify appropriate mechanisms&#13;
of continuous assessment of student learning for each grade.&#13;
2.14   The Curriculum Development and Implementation Unit (CDIU) of the NCERD is responsible&#13;
for developing and implementing curriculum at the primary and secondary levels of the educational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
system as well as the preparation of national examinations. For each of the four core subjects,&#13;
Curriculum, Instructional Materials and Assessment Teams (CIMAT) would be established to produce&#13;
the new curriculum guides and develop the basic library list (para. 2.16). Each CIMAT would comprise&#13;
of (i) a senior subject specialist, and a subject specialist from NCERD; and (ii) seven practicing teachers&#13;
(including one reading specialist) who would work part-time and be paid an honoraria. NCERD's&#13;
Learning Resources Unit would provide periodic assistance to CIMATs. It is expected that CIMATs&#13;
would confer the teams in the other core subjects in order to achieve cross-curricular consistency. In&#13;
addition, the project would fund consultants who would visit Guyana approximately every two to three&#13;
months to assist in curriculum implementation and field supervision. Reflecting the sequencing strategy&#13;
of curriculum development (para. 2.11), a CIMAT would be established first for each of Language Arts&#13;
and Mathematics, and then for Science and Social Studies. At negotiations, the Government agreed to&#13;
establish CIMATs for Language Arts and Math no later than December 1, 1996, and for Science&#13;
and Social Studies, no later than September 1, 1998 (para.3.40 (b)). The project would fund each of&#13;
the CIMATs for two years, initially. If needed, funding for the teams would be extended for an&#13;
additional two-year period, beyond which MEC would either take over their funding or terminate them.&#13;
In order to strengthen the MEC's curriculum development capability, the project would finance&#13;
professional development activities such as study tours, conferences, etc.&#13;
2.15   The project would also provide technical assistance to the NCERD's Test Development Unit in&#13;
the form of a short-term specialist in educational assessment to (i) assist the unit to design and&#13;
implement continuous assessment in the classroom and (ii) examine the structure of testing affecting&#13;
secondary students from the SSEE onward.&#13;
2.16   Provision of Textbooks and Other Instructional Materials. The project would provide the&#13;
pilot schools with a basic library of textbooks and teaching and learning materials, as specified for each&#13;
subject by the CIMAT (para. 2.14), to equip all students in the pilot schools with adequate curricular&#13;
resources. Books and materials would be procured by the Project Secretariat, and distributed to schools&#13;
by the Book Distribution Unit of NCERD through the applicable regional education department, until a&#13;
textbook policy is developed and adopted (para. 2.17). The ProcurementlFinance Coordinator of the&#13;
Project Secretariat would assume management responsibility for the procurement and distribution of&#13;
books and learning materials. While the texts and learning materials would be provided to students at no&#13;
charge, the schools would enforce an effective policy on student financial responsibility for lost or&#13;
damaged books. The project would fund a textbook specialist to help develop the basic library list and&#13;
other textbook-related functions. Additional assistance would be sought from other Bank-financed&#13;
projects in the Caribbean. CIMATs, with the assistance of the textbook specialist, would consult&#13;
extensively with pilot school principals and teachers in developing the basic library list. In most cases,&#13;
more than one text in a subject area would be selected, allowing schools to choose among alternative&#13;
texts to promote different program emphases. The review would begin with textbooks produced and&#13;
distributed under a recently completed UNDP-funded Textbook Program. Textbooks produced and/or&#13;
widely used in the region would also be considered.&#13;
2.17   The project would also support NCERD's Learning Resources Unit in defining an appropriate&#13;
overall textbook policy framework for Guyana, specifying how texts are to be selected, purchased,&#13;
distributed, replaced, re-selected and funded. The textbook specialist, funded by the project, would help&#13;
NCERD define and implement the overall textbook policy. At negotiations, the Government agreed to&#13;
adopt and implement such a textbook policy no later than September 1, 1996 (para 3.40 (c)).&#13;
2.18   In-Service Teacher Training. In spite of the presence of some dedicated and skilled teachers,&#13;
the prevailing capacity of Guyana's teachers in both subject content and pedagogy is limited. Extensive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
in-service training from the outset would therefore be an essential element in pilot school improvement.&#13;
Pedagogical emphasis would be placed on multi-level and team-teaching methods. The Project Director,&#13;
in collaboration with the ACEO/Secondary, would have overall responsibility for in-service training&#13;
activities in the pilot schools. In-service teacher training services provided by the project would be&#13;
carried out by the University of Guyana (UG) or a training institution acceptable to the IDA under a&#13;
contract with the project and would be coordinated with relevant secondary training activities conducted&#13;
by other institutions. The project would finance two consultants to assist the training institute in: (i) the&#13;
development and implementation of in-service training programs and (ii) the training of field supervisors&#13;
in effective classroom observation, monitoring and evaluation. In the course of developing and&#13;
implementing the teacher training programs, the UG itself would be strengthened by the extensive&#13;
technical assistance provided by said consultants. Consequently, the UG would be able to provide&#13;
critical long-term sustainability in teacher training after project completion.&#13;
2.19   For each pilot school, the project would finance: (i) preparation of detailed teacher-training&#13;
needs assessments based on the SIP; and (ii) the design and implementation of an in-service training&#13;
program to address the identified training needs. The in-service training program would focus training&#13;
resources on teachers who can be expected to remain with the secondary school system. Training would&#13;
include subject content, use of instructional resources, classroom management, pedagogy, and use of the&#13;
new curriculum guides as they become available. In-service training would comprise a summer&#13;
residential program, workshops in the regions throughout the year held either at a central pilot school or&#13;
a resource center and on-going classroom supervision (Annex VI).&#13;
2.20   Supervision. Good supervision and technical support of teachers is key to developing and&#13;
maintaining quality teaching and learning. Throughout the period during which pilot schools receive&#13;
continuous support, overall supervision of these schools would be carried out by the Project Secretariat.&#13;
Under the management of the Project Director, the project would fund three full-time supervision teams&#13;
(Annex VI). The project would finance technical assistance to train the supervision teams in: (i)&#13;
effective classroom observation; and (ii) providing technical support to teachers and administrators on&#13;
best pedagogical practices, classroom motivation and discipline techniques, use of new curriculum, use&#13;
of instructional materials, student assessment methodologies, development of student feedback system,&#13;
record keeping and collaborative teaching methods. The supervision team leader would provide&#13;
supervision reports on school visits to the Project Director with copies to ACEO/Secondary and the&#13;
REdO.&#13;
2.21   Performance Monitoring. The ultimate success of the reform program (i.e., improved&#13;
achievement scores, student matriculation rates into upper secondary grades, acquisition of meaningful&#13;
work, etc.) can only be detected towards the end of the project, and needs to be assessed at the school&#13;
level. In order to build a basis for impact evaluation, the pilot schools would be required to continuously&#13;
monitor and update: (i) school indicators, such as student and teacher attendance, the use of textbooks&#13;
and other learning materials, progress in teacher training and supportive supervision, and other efficiency&#13;
indicators; and (ii) indicators of student learning outcomes measured through continuous assessment.&#13;
Initially, these indicators would be supplied as part of the baseline information to be included in the SIP.&#13;
Initial and updated indicators would be verified by the pilot school supervision teams (para. 2.20). The&#13;
Project Secretariat would assume overall responsibility to ensure that these indicators are aggregated for&#13;
all pilot schools by the school information system (para. 2.29). A partial and a comprehensive analyses&#13;
on changes in student performance and achievements would be carried out prior to the Mid-Term Review&#13;
(para. 3.31) and upon the completion of implementation, respectively with assistance from a project-&#13;
financed evaluation specialist (para. 3.29).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
(2)    School Environment Component (US$11.2 million, 68% of baseline cost)&#13;
2.22   Learning at most schools (both primary and secondary) has been seriously hindered by: (i)&#13;
severe decay of buildings and facilities, which frequently poses physical dangers and sanitation problems&#13;
(para. 1.33); and (ii) overcrowding. Comprehensive rehabilitation (including reconstruction and&#13;
extension) of about 40 primary schools (roughly 10% of all primary schools in the country) is expected&#13;
to start under the IDB-financed PEIP this year. At the secondary level, limited repair work has been&#13;
done or is planned at about 10 schools (roughly 10% of GSSs and CHSs; including 5 of the 12 pilot&#13;
schools) under such programs as CPFP (EU financed) and SIMAP (IDB/IDA financed). Basic furniture&#13;
such as student desks and chairs, bookcases, blackboards, and desks for teachers and support staff are&#13;
generally inadequate and in poor repair. Equipment necessary to teach scientific and technological&#13;
topics is almost entirely absent from schools. The inadequate security structures of most schools have&#13;
also meant that much instructional material and equipment has been subject to theft.&#13;
a)     Pilot Schools Subcomponent (US$5.2 million, 32% of baseline cost)&#13;
2.23   In order to adequately support improvement of education at the pilot schools, the project would&#13;
support: (i) building rehabilitation and renovation; (ii) extension; (iii) construction of multi-purpose&#13;
laboratories; and (iv) acquisition of furniture. Because pilot schools would receive project inputs in the&#13;
forms of textbooks and other instructional materials (para. 2.16) as well as furniture and equipment,&#13;
security structures would be provided as part of the rehabilitation and renovation.&#13;
b)     Emergency School Repair Subcomponent (US$6.0 million, 37% of baseline cost)&#13;
2.24   The project would reserve funds for emergency repair works at non-pilot secondary schools&#13;
based on the needs for: (a) structural repairs (structural frame, foundations and walls); (b) roof repairs&#13;
(including weather proofing, insulation, sound separation); (c) life-safety exiting provisions (including&#13;
stairs); and (d) essential repairs of utility systems, including electrical system, potable water distribution&#13;
system, sewerage system and toilet blocks. Schools with the most serious life-safety violations would&#13;
rate highest for inclusion among the list of schools to be repaired under this component. Such needs&#13;
would be assessed through the Nationwide Physical Facilities Survey (2.28), which would include the&#13;
development of criteria, agreeable to IDA, to select secondary schools to be supported. Such criteria&#13;
should include: (i) repair needs identified through the Survey; (ii) student enrollment; (iii) history of&#13;
repair work in recent years; (iv) regional equity; and (v) urban-rural equity. The 12 pilot schools would&#13;
be ineligible under this subcomponent.&#13;
(3)    National and Regional Institutional Strengthening Component (US$2.1 million, 13% of&#13;
baseline cost)&#13;
2.25   The project would support a number of interventions designed to improve education sector&#13;
performance through strengthening of budget planning, organization and management, the school&#13;
information system, nationwide physical facility survey, social awareness campaigns, and preparation for&#13;
a follow-up project.&#13;
2.26   Budget Planning. During the appraisal, GOG confirmed that MEC is now responsible for the&#13;
review and clearance of regional education budget submissions prior to the MOF approval, and this was&#13;
reconfirmed at negotiations (para. 3.40 (d)). However, MEC lacks rational allocation criteria as well as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
staff to facilitate the allocation of scarce resources in the education sector. The project would support the&#13;
development and implementation of new budgeting guidelines, which would treat individual schools as a&#13;
basic planning unit and establish rational and clear resource allocation criteria (i.e., formula based on&#13;
number of students, availability of instructional materials, remoteness of location, etc.). The project&#13;
would fund an education finance specialist to assist with the preparation of the guidelines. The specialist&#13;
would train and work closely with the staff of the DPS/Finance, liaise closely with all the main actors in&#13;
school finance including MOF, RExOs, REdOs and in MEC, the DCEO/Admin., and help the principals&#13;
of pilot schools develop school-based budget systems to complement strengthened school management.&#13;
The purchase or development of a user-friendly computer application, which would facilitate budgeting&#13;
exercises would be supported as part of the school information system (para. 2.29).&#13;
2.27   Organization and Management. The project would support the development and&#13;
implementation of strategies to improve overall effectiveness of education administration. Such&#13;
strategies would be built on pertinent work carried out in the past and at present, including: (i) the draft&#13;
Desk Manual for Education Managers developed by MEC with technical assistance from UNICEF; and&#13;
(ii) relevant activities undertaken by the ongoing IDA-financed Public Administration Project. More&#13;
specifically, the project would finance consultants for: (a) increasing scope and depth of analyses carried&#13;
out by said work; (b) developing a long-term strategy and a detailed short-medium-term plan to improve&#13;
management effectiveness; and (c) training of MEC and regional education department staff in general&#13;
management skills (e.g., communication skills, priority management, information/file management, use&#13;
of office technology, and effective leadership) and educational administration subjects (such as budget&#13;
practice and school-based management systems). These activities would be closely coordinated with&#13;
Budget Planning Strengthening (para. 2.26) and the upgrading of the School Information System (para.&#13;
2.29). Office equipment including PC workstations, photocopying machines, fax machines and&#13;
additional telephone lines would also be provided by the project.&#13;
2.28   Nationwide Physical Facilities Survey. Dilapidation of school buildings and facilities as well&#13;
as overcrowding (paras. 1.33, 2.22) would continue to be serious problems. In order to assist the&#13;
Government in identifying capital investment priorities and carrying out resource planning, the project&#13;
would support a detailed nation-wide survey of secondary school infrastructure to be completed during&#13;
the first year of project implementation. The survey would select, based on criteria and methods&#13;
agreeable to IDA, representative samples of schools offering secondary education to be examined. Such&#13;
criteria and methods to select samples will be made as a part of the Project's Operational Manual&#13;
(para. 3.41 (a)). Physical examinations of the sample schools would be preceded by the development of&#13;
school design guidelines, including prototype design standards. The guidelines and standards would be&#13;
used by physical examination teams as an objective point of reference. Information generated through&#13;
the survey would become part of the School Information System (para. 2.29). It would also be used to&#13;
develop objective criteria to determine the eligibility and priorities of secondary schools to be supported&#13;
under the School Environment subcomponent of the project (para. 2.24). As a condition of&#13;
disbursement against the Emergency School Repair subcategory, the Government will complete&#13;
the Nationwide Physical Facility Survey in the following sequence: (a) development of school&#13;
design guidelines and standards satisfactory to IDA; (b) completion of the physical examinations of&#13;
the selected samples and publication of survey reports; and (c) development and adoption of&#13;
criteria, satisfactory to IDA, to be used to select schools for emergency repair (para. 3.43).&#13;
2.29   School Information System. Lack of information on individual schools has been a major&#13;
obstacle in sector management. In order to improve quality and availability of information on schools, a&#13;
school mapping exercise (SME) was initiated in 1993 with the assistance of SIMAP. The SME has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
completed initial data collection in all regions except Regions 1, 8 and 9. For data processing, the IDB-&#13;
supported PEIP has provided MEC with several personal computers.&#13;
2.30   The project would support the continuation of SME, and data collection in the remaining regions.&#13;
Furthermore, the project would finance the establishment of the School Information System (SIS), which&#13;
would be a permanent mechanism to compile, process and store information on: (a) individual students,&#13;
(b) student learning outcomes assessed on a sample or census basis; (c) teachers and staff; (d) teaching&#13;
methods and curricula, (e) textbooks, other instructional materials, equipment, and furniture; (f) school&#13;
sites and buildings; and (g) communities and school catchment areas. At present there are three major&#13;
data collection points in MEC (in the Education Planning Unit [EPU], the Finance Division, and the&#13;
Personnel Division). The upgraded SIS would be located in the EPU and headed by a School&#13;
Information Officer, who would be hired under the project and financed by the proposed IDA credit on a&#13;
declining basis (para. 3.15). S/he would report to the Chief Planning Officer. At negotiations, the&#13;
Government agreed to hire the Schools Information Officer under terms of reference acceptable to&#13;
IDA no later than September 1, 1996 (para. 3.40 (e)). REdO Offices would assume the function of&#13;
regional focal points for the SIS. The project would also finance a short-term management information&#13;
systems specialist who would: (i) analyze in detail the flow of information to and from schools, regional&#13;
administrations, and national agencies; (ii) develop a medium-long term computerization strategy; (iii) in&#13;
conjunction with said strategy, develop detailed design specifications of SIS enhancement, including data&#13;
structure and flow, hardware and software, application programs, prototype screen &amp; report formats,&#13;
communications and networking structure, and training. Based on the specifications developed, a firm&#13;
would be contracted to implement the SIS package, which would include computer hardware &amp; software,&#13;
additional application programs (if any to be developed), operational manuals, communication devices&#13;
and security devices. Computerization would be carried out by the project in MEC and all REdO offices&#13;
as well as the 12 pilot schools in order to test school level feasibility. SIS design and implementation&#13;
would be closely coordinated with relevant activities under Budget Planning (para. 2.26), Organization&#13;
and Management Strengthening (para. 2.27) and Nationwide Physical Facility Survey (para. 2.28).&#13;
2.31   Social Awareness Campaign. Given the wide-spread impact of the reform program on&#13;
students, parents, educators, employers and the general public, a social awareness campaign (SAC)&#13;
would be financed under the project to: (i) properly assess and reflect the views and concerns of stake-&#13;
holders in the reform process; and (ii) inform the public about reform objectives, benefits,&#13;
implementation strategies and progress made. The SAC would be carried out by a consulting firm&#13;
specialized in social marketing on contract to the Project Secretariat. The SAC would employ press&#13;
releases, discussions on TV and radio, newsletters, other media, community workshops, national&#13;
conferences, retreats for decision makers, etc., and closely collaborate with the school-based-&#13;
management specialist (para. 2.7) in order to assure stake-holder participation. Furthermore, as part of&#13;
its assignment, the firm would advise the Project Director on the views of various segments of the public&#13;
and how these views should affect the reform process.&#13;
2.32   Preparation of Phase II Project. As the initial phase of a long-term secondary education&#13;
reform, the present proposed project would support the preparation of a second-phase project. A Phase II&#13;
project would: (i) provide direct assistance to a larger number of schools in implementing the curricula&#13;
of 4 core subjects and supporting school-based management; (ii) develop and support the implementation&#13;
of curricula for subjects not covered by the proposed project (Phase I project), including Resource and&#13;
Technology; and (iii) introduce reform measures at the upper-secondary level (grades 10 and I 1).&#13;
Preparation of the Phase II project would be carried out by the Project Secretariat and MEC staff under&#13;
the guidance of the RMT with project financed technical assistance. The preparation could commence as&#13;
soon as the Phase I project has maintained performance highly satisfactory to IDA for over 12 months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Semi-annual IDA supervision missions (Annex VII, Table 3) would assess project performance based on&#13;
the agreed performance indicators (para. 3.29) and discuss with GOG the timing to start the preparation.&#13;

A.      Project Cost and Financing&#13;
3.1    Project costs. The total cost of the project, including physical and price contingencies, is&#13;
estimated at US$19.3 million or G$2,755 million. Baseline costs and contingencies are calculated at&#13;
US$16.3 million and US$3.0 million equivalent, respectively. The foreign exchange component is&#13;
expected to be 49% of total project costs. The breakdown of costs by project component is shown in&#13;
Table 3.1. A detailed breakdown of project expenditures by component is provided in Annex X, Table 1.&#13;

3.2     Basis of Cost Estimates. Project costs are estimated at 1995 prices. Estimated school&#13;
rehabilitation costs for the project are based on unit prices derived from cost analyses for the&#13;
rehabilitation of similar facilities from a sample of current contracts. Costs of equipment, furniture, and&#13;
materials are based on the prices of similar items procured in Guyana by the MEC. Cost of training,&#13;
local and international consultants, and other services reflect local or international rates, as applicable.&#13;
Cost estimates for textbooks are based on current costs and costing standards used by the MEC.&#13;
3.3    Contingency Allowances. Physical contingencies (averaging 4% baseline costs) are estimated&#13;
at 10% for pilot school related civil works and goods. No physical contingencies are assumed for&#13;
services, emergency school repair component, and administrative expenditures. Price contingencies&#13;
(averaging 14% of baseline costs) are estimated on the basis of expected annual international and local&#13;
price increases of 2.6% and 9.0%, respectively, throughout the life of the project. Total contingencies&#13;
represent 18% of baseline costs.&#13;
3.4    Foreign Exchange Component. Direct and indirect foreign exchange costs are estimated at&#13;
about G$1,353 million (US$9.5 million equivalent), including contingencies. Based on an analysis of&#13;
expenditures of similar projects in Guyana, the foreign exchange component for the major categories was&#13;
estimated as follows: civil works and furniture 50%; office technology equipment and vehicles, 100%;&#13;
other goods 95%; internationally-recruited consultants 100%.&#13;
3.5     Financing Plan. An IDA credit of US$17.3 million equivalent would finance 90% of total&#13;
project costs, excluding taxes (Table 3.2). The relatively high share of IDA support is deemed necessary&#13;
due to the substantial deterioration of Guyana's capacity to mobilize domestic resources, given high debt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
servicing requirements. Because all contracts through MEC are tax and duty exempt, the project cost&#13;
estimates exclude local taxes. At negotiations, the Government gave assurance that it would provide&#13;
annual project counterpart funds (para. 3.40 (f)).&#13;

3.6      Incremental Recurrent Costs. Because the project aims for qualitative improvements rather&#13;
than the expansion of coverage, incremental recurrent costs (IRC) generated by the project are expected&#13;
to be small (Table 3.3). IRC would be generated mainly by increases in building maintenance,&#13;
maintenance and operation of equipment, SIP support funds, replacement of books and instructional&#13;
materials, miscellaneous supplies, and MEC staff. These costs are projected to grow from US$0.05&#13;
million in 1997 to US$0.17 million in 2003 (final project year). In IDA's judgment, the government&#13;
would be in a position to absorb these costs, estimated at 0.7% of its education budget after the project is&#13;
completed, assuming the govemment increases its education expenditures by some 5% annually during&#13;
the duration of the project3.&#13;

3.7      Direct Input to Pilot Schools. Total baseline investment in the 12 pilot schools are estimated to&#13;
be US$6.3 million (38% of total project baseline costs) supporting rehabilitation, furniture, textbooks,&#13;
other learning materials and equipment, teacher and administrator training, and SIS related equipment.&#13;
3 In 1994, GOG increased its recurrent education budget by 23% and by 33% in 1995. Since real annual GDP&#13;
growth has been over 8% during the past three years, the projected annual increase in the recurrent education&#13;
budget is rather conservatively estimated at 5%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Assuming that the investment is amortized in 15 years, some 25,000 students would spend approximately&#13;
4 years at the 12 pilot schools. In this scenario, the average investment cost would be US$251 per&#13;
student for a 4-year education, or US$63 for each year spent by a student at a pilot school. Average&#13;
annual incremental recurrent costs per student are estimated to be less than US$12 for supporting&#13;
building maintenance, maintenance and operation of SIS and learning equipment, SIP, replenishment of&#13;
damaged or lost furniture, textbooks and other instructional materials, and miscellaneous supplies.&#13;
B.      Procurement&#13;
3.8     Procurement Assistance. The Project Secretariat in MEC would be responsible for the&#13;
procurement of project-funded inputs for both the MEC and the pilot schools as set-forth in the&#13;
procurement summary in Table 3.4. As a condition of effectiveness, a Procurement/Finance&#13;
coordinator with qualifications satisfactory to IDA would be hired within the Project Secretariat&#13;
to facilitate procurement (para. 3.41 (d)). The project would also finance the hiring of civil works&#13;
supervision firms and procurement agents (Annex IX).&#13;

3.9     Civil Works contracts for the rehabilitation of schools are expected to cost US$100,000 or more&#13;
and less than US$1.0 million will be awarded in accordance with National Competitive Bidding&#13;
Procedures (NCB), which must not discriminate against overseas bidders and are acceptable to IDA, up&#13;
to an aggregate contract value of US$5.9 million. GOG is already using standard bidding documents for&#13;
works under on-going projects financed by the IDA and IDB. These would be employed under the&#13;
proposed project and adapted as necessary. Contracts estimated to cost US$1.0 million or more would&#13;
be awarded in accordance with International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Only one pilot&#13;
school is expected to fall under the ICB category. Smaller works, which cannot be grouped into&#13;
packages of US$ 100,000 or more, would be procured under lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded on&#13;
the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified contractors in response to a written invitation up to&#13;
an aggregate contract value of US$3.0 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.10   Goods to be procured under the project would include office technology equipment, the school&#13;
information system, fumiture, books (textbooks and library books), other instructional materials and&#13;
equipment, and vehicles. The School Information Systems (para. 2.30) and any other office technology&#13;
equipment would be procured using Limited International Bidding (LIB) among manufacturers with&#13;
established service facilities in Guyana or neighboring countries. Books (textbooks and reading books)&#13;
as well as instructional materials and equipment would also be procured using LIB procedures. Furniture&#13;
would be procured in accordance with NCB procedures, and grouped whenever possible in packages of&#13;
US$50,000 or more but less than US$ 100,000. For smaller purchases, International Shopping&#13;
procedures may be used up to an aggregate amount of US$150,000 for contracts valued at less than&#13;
US$50,000, and National Shopping procedures up to an aggregate amount of US$50,000 for contracts&#13;
valued at less than US$10,000.&#13;
3.11   Consultants' Services will be contracted in accordance with the provisions of the Guideline for&#13;
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency, dated&#13;
August 1981. The Guideline also apply to the hiring of MEC supplemental staff, including the School&#13;
Information Officer (para. 2.30). Consultant services to be procured under the project are listed in&#13;
Annex VIII.&#13;
3.12   Prior Review. Prior IDA review would be required before bids are invited, and before final&#13;
decisions on contract awards are made for the following procurement actions: (a) all ICB and LIB&#13;
procurement; (b) all civil works contracts estimated to cost US$500,000 or more; (c) the first NCB&#13;
procurement in each of civil works and goods every year; (d) all consultants' services estimated to cost&#13;
US$50,000 or more if provided by a firm, and US$10,000 or more if provided by an individual; (e) all&#13;
consultants' services contracted using the direct contracting (single-source) procedure; (f) any&#13;
amendment of contracts resulting in the increase of the contract value beyond the review limits set in (a)&#13;
through (d) above; and (g) assignment of a critical nature as reasonably determined by IDA. The review&#13;
described here would provide for prior review by IDA of approximately 60% of the total value of IDA-&#13;
financed contracts. Random ex-post review of all other contracts will be carried out by IDA supervision&#13;
missions. Table 3.6 summarizes applicable procurement procedures and review requirements.&#13;
C.    Disbursement&#13;
3.13   Disbursement Profile. The proceeds of the credit are projected to be disbursed over a seven-&#13;
and a-half-year period, based on the standard disbursement profile for education projects in the region.&#13;
Accordingly, the project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2003, and the Closing Date would be&#13;
December 31, 2003. The Govemment has expressed its intention, however, to implement the project&#13;
over a five year period. A forecast of disbursements is shown in Table 3.5.&#13;

3.14   Required Documentation. Disbursement against the following expenditures would require the&#13;
submission of complete documentation: (a) all expenditures requiring ICB and LIB procurement; (b) all&#13;
civil works contracts valued at US$500,000 or more; (c) the first expenditure requiring NCB&#13;

US$50,000 or more if performed by a firm, and at US$10,000 or more if performed by an individual.&#13;
Disbursement against expenditures other than those specified in (a) through (d) in the above, and those&#13;
against activities not undertaken by contracts will be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures&#13;
(SOE). Documentation would be retained by the MEC and would be made available for IDA staff&#13;
review and the auditors. Applicable documentation requirements by contract value are summarized in&#13;

expenditures would be: (a) for civil works, 85%; (b) for goods, 100%  of foreign expenditures, 100%  of&#13;
local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 85% of local expenditures; (c) for consultants' services, 100%;&#13;
(d) for training, 100%; (e) for operating expenditures, 85%. Consultants' Service includes, inter alia,&#13;
Project Secretariat staff and practicing teachers contracted for CIMATs on a part-time basis. MEC&#13;
supplemental staff includes Schools Information Officer (para. 2.30). Project allowance for existing&#13;
government posts (salary top-ups) would be fully provided from GOG counterpart funds, and ineligible&#13;
for IDA disbursement. The proposed allocation of credit proceeds by disbursement category are&#13;
presented in Table 3.7.&#13;
3.16     Special Account. To facilitate project implementation, the Special Account (SA) opened in the&#13;
Bank of Guyana or in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA would be maintained and managed by MEC.&#13;
The authorized allocation would be US$1.2 million corresponding to about four months of estimated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
project expenditures. The initial deposit would be limited to US$500,000, with the full amount of the&#13;
authorized allocation to be released when disbursements have reached SDR 2 million. Applications for&#13;
replenishment of the special account would be submitted on a monthly basis or when one-third of the&#13;
amount deposited has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements would&#13;
follow the same procedures described in para. 3.14. In addition, monthly bank statements of the SA&#13;
would be submitted with each replenishment application.&#13;

D.    Accounting and Auditing&#13;
3.17     The MEC would keep project expenditure accounts, in accordance with internationally accepted&#13;
accounting practices. The Project Secretariat would employ a Procurement/Finance Coordinator to&#13;
maintain the project accounts under the supervision of the MEC's Deputy Permanent Secretary&#13;
(Finance).&#13;
3.18      Project accounts would be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the IDA. GOG&#13;
would provide copies of audited statements to the IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
The auditor's report would include opinions and comments, as necessary, on the project accounts and on&#13;
methods employed in compiling the statements of expenditure, their accuracy, the relevance of&#13;
supporting documents, their eligibility for financing in terms of the project's credit agreement, and the&#13;
standards of record-keeping and internal controls related to the foregoing. As a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness, the Government would contract audit services with an independent auditor whose&#13;
qualifications and terms of reference are satisfactory to IDA for the first year of the project (para.&#13;
3.41 (b)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

E.    Project Management and Implementation&#13;
3.19   Project Preparation and Readiness for Implementation. The proposed project was identified&#13;
by IDA staff who visited Guyana in September, 1994. It has been prepared by the Government, with the&#13;
assistance of the Project Preparation Facility and IDA staff. Preparation has been supported by PPF&#13;
P858-0.&#13;
3.20   The Secondary School Reform Program. The Project would be the first phase of a fifteen-year&#13;
Secondary School Reform Program (SSRP), which would require the long-term involvement of MEC, its&#13;
specialized units NCERD and CPCE, the University of Guyana, regional administrations, MOF, and&#13;
MPWCD. During project preparation, MEC assembled a reform management team (RMT), composed of&#13;
a number of senior MEC officials, including the Permanent Secretary, the Chief Education Officer and&#13;
other relevant MEC officers as well as a representative from MOF. The RMT has been and would be the&#13;
policy-setting group for the project. The management of secondary education was unified under the&#13;
ACEO/Secondary since September, 1995 when the post of ACEO/CHS was vacated. At negotiations,&#13;
GOG agreed to: (i) prepare, no later than December 31, 1996, an action plan satisfactory to IDA to&#13;
maintain the unity and cohesion of the management of secondary education, and (ii) commence, no&#13;
later than December 31, 1997, the implementation of the plan under the project. (para. 3.40 (g)).&#13;
3.21   Borrower Ownership. Throughout project preparation, careful measures have been taken to&#13;
establish borrower-ownership of the project and to ensure stakeholder participation. Immediately&#13;
following the preappraisal mission in March, 1995, the IDA financed a one-week study tour participated&#13;
by four senior MEC officials to Jamaica, where Bank-financed Education IV (L2899-JM) and Reform of&#13;
Secondary Education (ROSE; L3580-JM) projects have been implemented. Besides learning from the&#13;
Jamaican experience in secondary education reform, MEC staff and IDA staff engaged in intensive&#13;
discussions on detailed project design and strategies to complete project preparation. Overall criteria for&#13;
the selection of pilot schools were agreed on during this visit (para. 3.41 (a); Annex V). In addition, two&#13;
key MEC officials visited IDA headquarters in Washington for a period of two weeks and worked with&#13;
IDA staff to finalize the white-cover SAR as well as to learn about relevant Bank-funded educational&#13;
reforms in other countries.&#13;
3.22   Stakeholder Participation. Based on the agreed-on strategies, MEC has carried out extensive&#13;
consultations with stakeholders, including principals, teachers, parents, regional administrations, local&#13;
employers, Guyana Teacher's Union, Teachers Service Commission, etc. through formal and informal&#13;
meetings. Pilot schools were revisited and some of them were replaced. This consultative process has&#13;
began to tear down the strong sense of despair, which has been perpetuated by the prolonged neglect of&#13;
education and widespread in Guyana's education community, and is building momentum towards sound&#13;
education reform. The project, designed to promote decentralization of decision making and resource&#13;
management to the school and community level, would further encourage stakeholder participation.&#13;
3.23   Project Management. The project itself would be managed by a project director, who would&#13;
report to the Permanent Secretary of Education and would be a member of the RMT. He or she would be&#13;
responsible for the implementation of project activities and would manage the project through a small&#13;
Project Secretariat, which would be staffed with an Administrator, a Procurement/Finance Coordinator, a&#13;
Civil Works Coordinator, two administrative assistants, a secretary and a driver. The project director&#13;
would consult closely with the ACEO/Secondary and would manage individual project activities through&#13;
the individual MEC managers responsible, such as the Assistant Directors for Curriculum Development,&#13;
Learning Resources, and Test Development in NCERD for curriculum matters, the Chief Planning&#13;
Officer, for the School Information System, and the pilot school principals for School Improvement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Plans. The project would finance the salaries, office technology equipment, furniture and operational&#13;
costs of the Project Secretariat. As a condition of credit effectiveness, the Government would have&#13;
established the Project Secretariat, and appointed and posted the Project Director and the two&#13;
Coordinators of the Project Secretariat, with skills and experience satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.41&#13;
(d))&#13;
3.24   Education Program Quality. Developing and implementing pilot School Improvement Plans&#13;
under the project would be the responsibility of the pilot school principals and the School Improvement&#13;
Advisory Committees, under the SIP Guidelines developed and kept current by the ACEO/Secondary&#13;
(para. 2.6). The Project Director, other Secretariat staff, and consultants would provide the schools with&#13;
hands-on technical assistance in preparing SIPs.&#13;
3.25   The ACEO/Secondary would have overall responsibility for policy, planning and&#13;
implementation of training activities in the secondary schools in consultation with the REdOs and school&#13;
principals. All secondary training activities under the project would be managed by the Project Director&#13;
in close coordination with the ACEO/Secondary. The Learning Systems Committee under the&#13;
DCEO/Development would provide coordination among all pre- and in-service training activities. The&#13;
Project Director, with assistance from the Project Secretariat, would oversee both the project's training&#13;
activities for pilot school managers and its in-service training activities for pilot school teachers.&#13;
Training activities under the project for pilot school principals and senior managers, REdOs, DEOs and&#13;
DESs would be designed and carried out by MEC, MOF and other government personnel and a school&#13;
management specialist. Residential in-service teacher training would be contracted out to a training&#13;
institution under a Training Agreement with the project acceptable to IDA (para. 3.41 (a)). The&#13;
Project Director would supervise this contract.&#13;
3.26   Curriculum and textbook activities would be coordinated by the Assistant Directors for&#13;
Curriculum Development and Learning Resources, NCERD. Individual core-subject Curriculum,&#13;
Instructional Materials and Assessment Teams (CIMATs), composed of relevant NCERD curriculum&#13;
and textbook specialists, would carry out project activities in curriculum and instructional materials.&#13;
Three full-time supervision teams would be created to provide continuing curriculum support and&#13;
training to the pilot schools. The teams would consist of members from UG's training operation (teacher&#13;
trainers and subject specialists) and the regional education office (typically the DEO or DES).&#13;
Designated personnel from the Inspectorate would visit schools periodically. The Procurement/Finance&#13;
Coordinator would assume the overall responsibility to oversee the delivery of goods to pilot schools or&#13;
any other applicable recipient (para 2.16).&#13;
3.27   Civil Works. The Project Director and Civil Works Coordinator would be involved in assisting&#13;
the pilot schools develop the civil works components of their SIPs. Once MEC, the regional&#13;
administration, and the Project Secretariat have approved a SIP, including the civil works component, the&#13;
Civil Works Coordinator, with assistance from a consulting engineering/architectural firm, would&#13;
prepare and drawings and bidding documents for the pilot schools and assist the Project Secretariat in&#13;
supervising the civil works carried out under the project. Appointment and posting of a Civil Works&#13;
Coordinator whose qualification is acceptable to IDA is a condition of effectiveness (para. 3.41 (d)).&#13;
As a condition of disbursement against the civil works component, the Government would contract&#13;
an engineering/architectural firm for assistance in the preparation of drawing and bidding&#13;
documents and supervising construction (para. 3.42).&#13;
3.28   Project Launch Workshop. To initiate project implementation, a project launch workshop to&#13;
review the project and provide specific types of training for the project participants, would be held&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
following Board approval. Participants would be persons with significant responsibility under the&#13;
project, including Project Secretariat and other MEC personnel, regional officers, pilot school principals&#13;
and deputy principals, and selected officials from other ministries and agencies.. Project personnel, IDA&#13;
staff and selected specialists would lead workshop sessions. The topics to be covered would include: (i)&#13;
a detailed review of project design; (ii) a description of how all parts of the project fit together and&#13;
contribute to overall project goals; (iii) project management (i.e., Bank procurement and disbursement&#13;
procedures, financial management, a team approach to project management, auditing, reporting&#13;
requirements, monitoring and evaluation, and computer topics); (iv) a review of the major conceptual&#13;
elements underpinning project interventions (e.g., school-based management concepts, educational&#13;
finance, curriculum theory, international availability of appropriate teaching materials, training methods&#13;
and objectives, and school supervision practice), and (v) clarification of the tasks and responsibilities of&#13;
all project participants.&#13;
F.    Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
3.29   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E). Draft project monitoring indicators prepared by MEC&#13;
were reviewed during appraisal. At negotiations, GOG submitted a revised list of the project's&#13;
monitoring/performance indicators (para. 3.40 (h)). The adoption of the project's monitoring&#13;
indicators acceptable to IDA as part of the operating manual is a condition of effectiveness (para.&#13;
3.41 (a)) To assist the Project Secretariat and MEC, the project would fund an education project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation specialist, under terms of reference acceptable to IDA, to carry out&#13;
independent: (i) Mid-Term Evaluation; and (ii) Implementation Completion Evaluation.&#13;
3.30   Required Reports and Update of Implementation Plan and Budget. In addition to financial&#13;
and audit reports specified in 3.18, GOG at negotiations agreed on the following reporting schedules.&#13;
The Project Director, on behalf of GOG, will submit for IDA's review: (i) no later than March 31 and&#13;
September 30 each year, a semi-annual reports detailing project activities during the preceding July-&#13;
December and January-June, respectively, with up-to-date monitoring indicators of the project and the&#13;
education system as agreed with IDA, starting September 30, 1996; and (ii) no later than October 31 each&#13;
year starting in 1996, the implementation plan--detailing, inter alia, physical implementation schedule,&#13;
procurement plan, and the budget request to be submitted for MOF--for the following GOG fiscal year,&#13;
based on the evaluation of monitoring indicators and in consultation with stakeholders (para. 3.40 (i)).&#13;
An implementation plan for the first year of the project as well as a five year indicative plan (Annex XI)&#13;
were reviewed during the appraisal. Updating the implementation plan for the first calendar year to&#13;
IDA's satisfaction is a condition of effectiveness (Para. 3.41 (e)). The reports and plans mentioned in&#13;
this paragraph would constitute bases for IDA supervision missions, which are tentatively scheduled for&#13;
November and May each year. Planned reporting (except audit reports) and supervision schedules are&#13;
presented as Annex VII, Table 3.&#13;
3.31    Mid-Term Review. The project mid-term review is planned for December, 1999, which is 3&#13;
years after effectiveness. It would assess the experience gained and lessons learned with the first group&#13;
of pilot schools and recommend adjustments in project planning and implementation.&#13;
G.    Benefits and Risks&#13;
3.32   Benefits. Immediate beneficiaries of the project would be (i) approximately 6,500 students who&#13;
are currently enrolled in the pilot schools and new entrants; (ii) about 300 teachers and administrators&#13;
directly involved in the reform program; (iii) some 15,000 students and 700 teachers of other secondary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
schools, which would receive emergency repair services; and (iv) the MEC and regional administrations.&#13;
A greater number of students and teachers would benefit from an updated and more relevant curriculum,&#13;
greater availability and quality of textbooks and other instructional materials, and more effective teacher&#13;
training. The MEC would also benefit from its enhanced capacity for formulating sound sector policies&#13;
and implementing effective educational programs. This would build a foundation to ensure the&#13;
sustainability of follow-up activities. Lessons learned and institutions strengthened under the project&#13;
would be fully utilized in the Phase II project (para. 2.32 and 3.31). In the long run, the economy would&#13;
benefit from a larger pool of more skilled labor capable of adapting for rapidly changing economic and&#13;
business scenes and supporting the recent turnabout and growth of the economy.&#13;
3.33   Risks and Safeguards. Risks to the project include: (a) weak institutional capacity; (b) slow&#13;
procurement; (c) continuing high emigration rates among educated population; (d) the uncertainty of&#13;
public support; and (e) limited availability of counterpart financing.&#13;
3.34   Weak Institutional Capacity. This is a public sector wide problem caused primarily by low wage&#13;
levels, which is being addressed in the on-going IDA funded Public Administration Program as well as&#13;
other programs supported by various bilateral donors. National and regional administrations suffer from&#13;
serious shortages of qualified personnel. High staff turnover rates, hindering institutional memory, could&#13;
seriously disrupt or delay critical project activities. The project would attempt to mitigate such risks by:&#13;
(i) setting a limited number of attainable objectives, including key elements for institutional&#13;
strengthening and follow-up operations; and (ii) placing qualified consultants in key sections of the MEC&#13;
to supplement the ministry's capacity and provide it with institutional continuity throughout the duration&#13;
of the project.&#13;
3.35   Slow Procurement. As a rule, GOG employs strict competitive bidding procedures. Nearly all&#13;
contracts are required to be advertised, and any contracts over G$6 million (US$42,000) and G$9 million&#13;
(US$63,000) must be reviewed by the Central Tender Board and the Cabinet, respectively. Although&#13;
GOG procedures are compatible with IDA guidelines, the low thresholds and slow review processes&#13;
resulting from weak institutional capacity would hinder project implementation. GOG is currently&#13;
attempting to streamline procurement procedures with assistance from IDB and UNDP. The project&#13;
would employ a Procurement/Finance Coordinator in the Project Secretariat and finance the use of&#13;
procurement agents to minimize the risk (para. 3.8).&#13;
3.36   Continuing High Migration Rates Among Educated Population. There is a possibility that some&#13;
teachers, government staff and better educated secondary graduates trained under the project may simply&#13;
leave the country. This risk, however, will be mitigated if Guyana sustains high rates of economic growth&#13;
and improved conditions for teachers.&#13;
3.37   Uncertainty in Public Support. Although the Guyanese are, in general, supportive of education,&#13;
drastic changes may not be well received. Vested interests of certain groups, particularly of those who&#13;
have benefited most from the present system need to be considered. To generate broad-based support for&#13;
a long term reform, the project would fund social awareness campaigns and disseminate examples of&#13;
school level success through the pilot schools program. This would hopefully create a more favorable&#13;
ground for tackling more challenging and controversial issues at later stages of the reform process. At&#13;
the school level, SIACs (para. 2.5) are expected to evolve into an institution that would assure&#13;
sustainability of school improvement by mobilizing parent and community participation.&#13;
3.38   Budgetary Constraints Caused by Severe Debt-Service Obligations Could Limit the Availability&#13;
of Counterpart funds. This risk has been reduced by designing a project with less counterpart funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
needs. Incremental recurrent costs generated by the project are estimated to be about 5% of annual&#13;
recurrent education expenditure (para. 3.6), which is within a reasonable and sustainable range&#13;
considering that economic growth is projected at about 7% a year and that tax revenue is also expected to&#13;
grow. Strengthening of budget planning (para. 2.26) would contribute directly to sustainability by&#13;
providing instruments to allocate scarce resources more rationally and efficiently.&#13;
H.    Environment&#13;
3.39   Since the project would finance technical assistance and a limited-scale school rehabilitation, it&#13;
would produce no significant negative environmental impact. No resettlement is expected. An&#13;
environmental rating of"C" has been given to the Project.&#13;
I.     Agreements Reached and Recommendation&#13;
3:40   At negotiations, the Government agreed to the following:&#13;
(a)    To provide annual budget support, equivalent to at least US$3.00 per student on the&#13;
average, to pilot school discretionary funds for uses specified in their approved SIPs&#13;
(para. 2.8);&#13;
(b)    To establish a CIMAT for each of Language Arts and Math no later than December 1,&#13;
1996, and for each of Science and Social Studies, no later than September 1, 1998 (para.&#13;
2.14).&#13;
(c)    To adopt and implement a textbook policy no later than September 1, 1996 (para. 2.17);&#13;
(d)    To maintain MEC's responsibility for the clearance of annual regional education budget&#13;
submissions prior to MOF approval (para. 2.26).&#13;
(e)    To hire a Schools Information Officer (para. 2.30) under terms of reference acceptable&#13;
to IDA no later than September 1, 1996;&#13;
(f)    To allocate yearly project counterpart funds as agreed with IDA (para. 3.5);&#13;
(g)    (i) To prepare, no later than December 31, 1996, an action plan satisfactory to IDA to&#13;
maintain the unity and cohesion of the management of secondary education, and (ii) to&#13;
commence, no later than December 31, 1997, the implementation of the plan under the&#13;
project (para. 3.20);&#13;
(h)    To revise the submitted drafts of: (i) the SIP Guidelines (para. 2.6); and (ii) the list of&#13;
project monitoring indicators (para. 3.29); and,&#13;
(i)    To submit reports in accordance with the agreed schedules (para.3.30).&#13;
3.41   As conditions of credit effectiveness, the Government will:&#13;
(a)    Adopt a set of Operational Manuals for the project, satisfactory to IDA, consisting of: (i)&#13;
pilot school eligibility criteria (para. 3.21; Annex V-para.10); (ii) the model of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Training Agreement (para. 3.25); (iii) criteria and methods to select sample schools for&#13;
the Nationwide Physical Facility Survey (para.2.28); and (iv) monitoring indicators for&#13;
the Project (para. 3.40 (h));&#13;
(b)    Contract for audit services with an independent auditor whose qualifications and terms&#13;
of reference are satisfactory to IDA for the first year of the project (para. 3.18);&#13;
(c)    Submit the SIP Guidelines satisfactory to IDA (para. 2.6);&#13;
(d)    Establish the Project Secretariat and complete the appointment and posting of the Project&#13;
Director and the two Coordinators, with qualifications and terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, of the Project Secretariat (paras. 3.23 and 3.27); and,&#13;
(e)    Submit the updated implementation plan for the first calendar year of the project&#13;
satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.30).&#13;
3.42   As a condition of disbursement against Civil Works (applicable to both the Pilot School and&#13;
Emergency School Repair subcategories), the Government would contract with an&#13;
engineering/architectural firm for assistance in preparing drawings and bidding documents and&#13;
supervising construction (para. 3.27);&#13;
3.43   As a condition of disbursement against the Emergency School Repair sub-category, the&#13;
Government would complete the Nationwide Physical Facility Survey in the agreed sequence (para.&#13;
2.28).&#13;
3.44   Recommendation: Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would&#13;
constitute a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$17.3 million equivalent to the Republic of Guyana for&#13;
a period of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, on standard IDA terms.&#13;

SECONDARY SCHOOL REFORM PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX II: THE EDUCATION SECTOR - ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONAL&#13;
RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
1.    In 1985 the Government of Guyana decentralized responsibility for the provision and&#13;
administration of several services to ten newly established Regional Administrations. Education was&#13;
among these functions. The functions and responsibilities of the different administrative levels are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
THE CENTRAL LEVEL&#13;
The Ministry of Education and Cultural Development&#13;
2.     Organizational Structure: The MEC is headed by a politically appointed Minister. All positions&#13;
below the Minister are career civil service positions, including the Permanent Secretary.&#13;
3.     Responsibilities: The MEC sets national education policy and establishes a national curriculum&#13;
which all Regional education bodies are meant to adhere to. The MEC is also responsible for monitoring&#13;
education indicators in the Regions to ensure that serious inequities in education services and quality do not&#13;
arise. The MEC also selects, funds, procures, and distributes textbooks to all schools.&#13;
4.    In addition, the MEC is responsible for the administration of all schools in the metropolitan&#13;
Georgetown area. An Assistant Chief Education Officer (Georgetown) supervises these functions and&#13;
works within the same terms of reference as a R.Ed.O.&#13;
5.     Staffing: The MEC cannot directly hire its staff. It prepares advertisements and submits these to&#13;
the Public Service Commission (PSC) which runs the advertisements and reviews candidates. The PSC&#13;
short lists candidates for the MEC and recommends which candidate should be selected. In most cases&#13;
MEC input is, however, obtained during the preparation of the short lists.&#13;
6.     The MEC currently suffers severe shortages of trained, technically competent staff. This is very&#13;
largely a consequence of low civil service salaries.&#13;
The Teacher's Service Commission&#13;
7.     The TSC is a para-statal body over which the MEC has no direct authority. The functions of the&#13;
TSC were reduced under the decentralized system when certain functions became the responsibility of the&#13;
Regional Education Officers (REdOs). Presently, the TSC's responsibilities are to hire and discipline&#13;
tenured teachers. When a vacancy for a tenured teacher arises in a school, the REdO advises the TSC which&#13;
places a national advertisement, selects and appoints the candidate. Similarly, if a school experiences&#13;
problems with a tenured teacher it sends a formal complaint to the REdO who communicates this to the&#13;
TSC which then reviews the case and decides on appropriate action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
THE REGIONAL LEVEL&#13;
8.    In each Region, a Regional Administration is responsible for budgeting and oversight functions of&#13;
four services, one of which is education. The Regional Administration is headed by a Regional Executive&#13;
Officer (RExO) who is supported by a staff which varies with the population size of the Region. Political&#13;
representation in each Region is achieved through a Regional Democratic Council (RDC). Council&#13;
members of the RDC are politically appointed, reflecting the proportion of votes cast for the different&#13;
national political parties in that Region during the national elections. The RExO is a civil servant who acts&#13;
in the capacity of clerk to the RDC. In practice, RDCs in many Regions are weak and uninvolved in the&#13;
Regional Administration. As a result, RExOs often wield considerable powers.&#13;
9.     Some combination of councilors in each RDC are meant to participate in an Education&#13;
Subcommittee whose function is to establish education policy for the Region. These Subcommittees are&#13;
rarely found in practice, however. In Regions where Education Subcommittees function, the REdO, despite&#13;
his technical expertise, cannot participate actively to influence the Subcommittees decisions. The REdO is&#13;
only a silent observer to the Subcommittee meetings. Education administration in each Region is the&#13;
responsibility of an Education Department which is attached to each Regional Administration.&#13;
Regional Education Departments&#13;
10.    Organization Structure: Regional Education Departments are staffed by:&#13;
*  A REdO who is appointed by the MEC (through the Ministry of Public Works), but who reports&#13;
both to the MEC and the RExO. The REdO is the key education official in the Regions.&#13;
*  One or two District Education Officers who assist the REdO with his duties&#13;
*  One or more Education Supervisors, who inspect schools and monitor performance&#13;
*  In one Region the Education Department employs a Personnel Officer.&#13;
11.    Responsibilities: REdOs have enormous responsibilities. They are responsible for: implementing&#13;
national education policy in the Region; preparing the regional education budget; deciding on moneys to be&#13;
allocated to each school in the Region; paying teacher salaries; negotiating with RExOs for education&#13;
moneys on a monthly basis; purchasing all supplies and equipment for each school in the Region;&#13;
supervising all infrastructure rehabilitation programs; monitoring education quality in the region;&#13;
performing all personnel functions related to school staff, including the appointment of temporary and&#13;
acting teachers; and, supervising Education Department employees.&#13;
12.    The REdO's work is made more difficult by the fact that they are accountable to two different&#13;
bodies -- the MEC(on curriculum and education policy issues) and the RExO. (on finance and&#13;
infrastructure issues). This bifurcated line of responsibility causes problems and, in practice, most REdOs&#13;
report almost exclusively to the RExO. This is because of the RExOs' physical proximity and because of&#13;
their control over the education purse. The MEC cannot directly censure REdOs for poor performance; the&#13;
Public Service Commission does this at the request of the MEC. It is widely acknowledged that this system&#13;
works poorly.&#13;
13.    REdOs prepare the Region's education budget. Although they should liaise with the MEC on the&#13;
budget preparation there is no requirement that they do so. In practice they do not. In most Regions,&#13;
REdOs prepare the budget without input from the schools. Budgets are not based on objective criteria such&#13;
as student enrollment. The REdO's estimated budget is adjusted by the RExO who then submits it, as part&#13;
of the entire Regional Administration budget, to the MOF. Each Region then negotiate adjustments to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
proposed budget with the MOF. The agreed-on budget is then transferred by the MOF to the Regional&#13;
Administration on a monthly basis. The RExO then releases funds to the R.Ed.O. Any moneys un-spent&#13;
each month are forfeited.&#13;
14.    Staffing: REdOs are recruited from a pool of senior teachers and headmasters/mistresses and&#13;
receive no formal training to prepare them for the additional administrative responsibilities. They are&#13;
recruited by the MEC (through the Ministry of Public Works which has responsibility for advertising and&#13;
identifying candidates).&#13;
THE LOCAL LEVEL&#13;
15.    Schools cannot effectively influence education policy or management decisions. No system is in&#13;
place whereby principals or teachers can inform or influence REdO or Regional Administration decisions;&#13;
they must exert influence purely through informal channels.&#13;
16.    Community participation in the administration and management of schools varies widely across&#13;
regions and schools. It tends to be weak in all but the best performing schools. Although all schools are&#13;
meant to have PTAs or school boards they are found principally in better performing secondary schools.&#13;
PTAs do not seem to work to influence the curriculum or core education issues. Rather, they raise funds for&#13;
the school. There are no restrictions on the way these funds may be used; they may even be used to&#13;
supplement teacher salaries.&#13;

GUYANA&#13;
SECONDARY SCHOOL REFORM PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX V: PILOT SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PLANS&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    The proposed project would fund about 12 pilot school improvement plans (SIP) in selected&#13;
secondary and primary top schools. The SIPs, which would be prepared by the schools themselves,&#13;
would be expected to have among their objectives to improve school performance in areas such as: (i)&#13;
increasing student achievement; (ii) reducing repetition and drop-out rates; (iii) dealing with student&#13;
behavioral problems; (iv) enhancing teacher performance; (v) improving school facilities and, if&#13;
necessary, reducing overcrowding and, (vii) increasing parent and community participation and support&#13;
in schools.&#13;
2.    The 12 pilot SIPs constitute the first stage of a long-term nation-wide program to improve the&#13;
quality of Guyana's secondary schools. Consequently, they are intended to be both cost-effective and&#13;
replicable on a large scale given Guyana's limited financial and human resources. In financial terms,&#13;
each pilot plan would include funding over a three-year period for inputs for: (i) teacher training, (ii)&#13;
textbooks and learning resources, and (iii) physical improvements. These inputs would be provided by&#13;
the MEC directly to the school on the basis of the SIP. In addition, each pilot school would be provided&#13;
a small amount of discretionary funding, equivalent to US$3.00 per student per year, for three years, for&#13;
direct investment by the school administration for school improvement initiatives not provided by the&#13;
MEC directly.&#13;
Financial Arrangements&#13;
3.    Each pilot school would be expected to mobilize supplementary financial and other support for&#13;
their SIPs from their respective Regional Executive Officers (RExO) and their local communities.&#13;
Accordingly, community representatives and parents would be invited to serve on a School Improvement&#13;
Advisory Committee (SIAC) with the principal, teachers and students, which each school would be&#13;
required to establish for preparing their plans. The RExOs in turn, would be asked to commit funds in&#13;
support of the plan and to sustain the investments in school improvements following the first three years&#13;
of project funding. The amounts of recurrent funding required by each school following the pilot project&#13;
will be calculated during preparation of the SIPs.&#13;
Management&#13;
4.    The management arrangements for the SIPs are as follows. The Project Director would have overall&#13;
responsibilities within MEC for the implementation of SIPs as for all other aspects of the project.&#13;
Developing and implementing SIPs under the project would be the responsibility of the pilot school&#13;
principals and the SIAC assisted by the DEO and REdO. MEC support for different aspects of SIPs would&#13;
be the direct responsibility of the Assistant Chief Education Officer (ACEO ) Secondary and the respective&#13;
MEC regular line managers of departments and/or contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
SIP Approval and Funding&#13;
5.    The SIP would be submitted by school principals to the Regional Education Officer who, in&#13;
consultation with the Project Director and the ACEO (Secondary), would be responsible for the final&#13;
approval of the SIPs in accordance with evaluation guidelines which would be developed by the Project&#13;
Director and the ACEO (Secondary).&#13;
Monitoring and Support&#13;
6.    The SIPs would be monitored by a team comprised of the ACEO (Secondary), the Project&#13;
Director and other persons called upon for specific assignments, i.e. teacher training. Civil works would&#13;
be monitored by the Project Engineer and an independent firm hired by the project.&#13;
Guidelines&#13;
7.    The ACEO (Secondary) would prepare guidelines with the assistance of the Project Director, for&#13;
school administrators and others on the formulation, implementation and monitoring of SIPs. The&#13;
guidelines would be prepared with the help of principals, teachers, community leaders and MEC staff.&#13;
The SIP guidelines would provide guidance on matters such as: (i) the role of principals, teachers,&#13;
students and the community in the SIP planning and implementation process; (ii) role and functions of a&#13;
School Improvement Advisory Committee (SIAC) ; (iii) how to define basic problems and objectives of&#13;
the School Improvement Plan; (iv) how to prepare a budget; (v) support to be provided by MEC and (vi)&#13;
scheduling for preparing and implementing a SIP.&#13;
8.    The MEC would issue guidelines and indicative budget figures to guide pilot schools in&#13;
preparing their SIPs. The SIPs are to be kept simple, but would be expected to include, inter alia: (i) a&#13;
description of the school's student population and teaching staff, including quantitative and qualitative&#13;
information; (ii) objectives for student learning outcomes and the rationale for them, (iii) priority areas to&#13;
be improved in educational quality and infrastructure with quantitative and qualitative targets;&#13;
(iv) strategies to take advantage of project inputs in improving identified areas; (v) implementation&#13;
strategies and sequencing, (vi) strategies to effectively involve and obtain support from teachers,&#13;
students, parents and the community, (vii) negotiated arrangements for greatly increased mobility&#13;
between the pilot school and geographically accessible schools offering upper-secondary education, and&#13;
(viii) a detailed budget for the school, within MEC guidelines and RA requirements, to finance the&#13;
planned school improvements.&#13;
9.    The MEC would organize orientation and training in the SIP guidelines for principals, teachers,&#13;
the SIAC and District Education officers.&#13;
10.   Twelve pilot schools were chosen by the MEC during project preparation, following visits and&#13;
interviews with school officials and based on the following criteria: (i) strong leadership of the principal;&#13;
(ii) willingness of the teachers; (iii) geographic diversity and easy accessibility from Georgetown to&#13;
facilitate management and monitoring; and (iv) participation of the three main types of secondary&#13;
schools.&#13;

GUYANA&#13;
SECONDARY SCHOOL REFORM PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX VI: SCHOOL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT&#13;
1.    Guyana critically needs to upgrade the knowledge and skills of secondary school students'&#13;
through a reform of curriculum, teacher training and increased availability of textbooks and instructional&#13;
materials. The three-tier secondary school structure is both inefficient and inequitable. While the overall&#13;
quality of education is sub-optimal, General Secondary Schools (GSS) have higher quality teachers,&#13;
buildings and teaching materials while the Community High Schools/Primary Tops (CHS/PT),&#13;
particularly the PTs, have deficiencies in all educational inputs.. The primary factors contributing to poor&#13;
quality include (i) passive approach to teaching,; (ii) focus on compartmentalized content-driven&#13;
curriculum; (iii) lack of adequate support resources and (iv) absence of a whole school approach to&#13;
teaching.&#13;
2.    The overall purpose of the curriculum reform is to update the content and approaches to teaching&#13;
and learning to modify the existing program in light of changes in the demand on education. Specifically,&#13;
the curriculum reform would (i) develop-and implement a common curriculum; (ii) provide appropriate&#13;
teacher training to support the curriculum and (iii) provide supporting instructional materials and&#13;
textbooks.&#13;
CURRICULUM&#13;
3.    The foundation of the curriculum reform is a curriculum using multi-level and cross-curricular&#13;
approaches to teaching and learning. The multilevel approach presupposes that students of varying&#13;
skills' level can pursue a common core in most subject areas. The curriculum would respond to the&#13;
variety of students because many students categorized as "slow-learners" may have no other disability&#13;
but the inability to read. The cross curricular approach would assist in strengthening language skills,&#13;
which are very weak, by incorporating reading, writing and oral expression into other core subjects. At&#13;
the same time, problem solving, interpretation of data and use of quantitative information would be&#13;
reinforced in the language component of the curriculum. Common concepts and/or areas of content are&#13;
consolidated so they are not taught in isolation. An integrated approach to the curriculum would result in&#13;
school learning more relevant to learners' needs. While this project would not finance pre-vocational&#13;
education, the MEC would begin to review the pre-vocational curriculum with respect to the&#13;
development of the common curriculum for the four core areas. Support for students' eventual transition&#13;
to the work place would be addressed by career education concepts integrated throughout the curriculum.&#13;
School guidance counselors would provide leadership in this aspect of the curriculum.&#13;
4.    Currently, all schools have similar core curriculum however implementation and instructional&#13;
practices differ significantly. The main difference in the GSS and the CHS/PT schools lies in the quality&#13;
of education with respect to teacher qualifications and resources available to students and teachers. The&#13;
GSS follows the CXC syllabi however test results are extremely low. Of those students taking the CXC&#13;
examination, only 12% and 13% received Grade I and II in English and Math respectively. This&#13;
compares with an average of 35 and 40% in other Caribbean countries. The CHS/PT schools have a less&#13;
academic approach to the curriculum, however students do not receive the necessary minimum basic and&#13;
pre-vocational skills needed required for further training /apprenticeships. CHS/PT student achievement&#13;
levels are very low with serious deficiencies, particularly in Language and Math.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
5.     The academic core is composed of English/Language Arts, Mathematics, Science and Social&#13;
Studies. Differences between the GSS and CHS/PT include; (i) GSS require a foreign language; (ii)&#13;
English in GSS is divided in two classes - English and Literature and in the CHS/PT divided between&#13;
English and Reading and (iii) CHS/PT teach integrated science while the GSS Grade 9 teach separate&#13;
subjects, i.e. biology, chemistry. Differences in the pre-vocational curricula lie primarily in the time-&#13;
tabling and duration of classes .&#13;
6.     Language Arts: Students enter Grade 7 with varying levels of skills and competencies in&#13;
language. While students have some measure of proficiency in English enabling them to pass the SSEE,&#13;
the majority of youth are underachieving in the skills required for reading, writing and learning as they&#13;
move through lower secondary school. As a result, critical English language deficiencies exist at the end&#13;
of all secondary schools, particularly the CHS/PT. The new curriculum would be designed to integrate&#13;
the existing GSS and the CHS/PT English course structures with emphasis placed on content and&#13;
instructional approaches that would improve learning. Incorporating new trends in teaching English,&#13;
such as the whole language approach, would increase achievement levels. The key concept in the design&#13;
of the Language Arts curriculum would be not only the development of English language proficiency but&#13;
the providing opportunities for students to apply them in meaningful and realistic context in and out of&#13;
the school environment.&#13;
7.     Mathematics: Student performance in math is somewhat stronger than in English language.&#13;
Nevertheless, the math curriculum in both the GSS and CHS/PT for Grades 7-9 is ambiguous in terms of&#13;
content. The new math curriculum would adopt a more active approach to learning math concepts&#13;
through experimenting and constructing real-life problems solving scenarios. The variety, level and&#13;
sequencing of topics would be developed in close coordination with the primary school math and the&#13;
patterns of student achievement levels up through Grade 6. In addition, linkages would be developed&#13;
between math and other areas of study, including science, social studies and pre-vocational subjects.&#13;
8.     Science: The existing science curriculum is limited by a lack of appropriate space and equipment&#13;
and a very theoretical approach to content. The new curriculum would focus on hands-on, process-&#13;
oriented experiences emphasizing the use of science process skills to solve practical problems. Activities&#13;
are designed using a group approach so that students work cooperatively and all students can benefit&#13;
from the experiences.&#13;
9.     Social Studies: Changes in the social studies curriculum would include (i) more history and&#13;
geography instruction in regions beyond the Caribbean and (ii) development of more problem-solving&#13;
and critical thinking activities rather than the existing memorizing of information approach.&#13;
10    For each subject, Curriculum, Instructional Materials and Assessment Teams (CIMAT),&#13;
responsible for producing the new curricula, would be established in NCERD under the Assistant&#13;
Director of the Curriculum Development and Implementation Unit (CDIU). Each CIMAT would&#13;
produce guides for Grades 7-9 during the two year preparation and piloting cycle. Extensive school&#13;
technical support and supervision would be provided to the pilot schools. Guides would be produced in&#13;
the following sequence: (i) Language Arts and Mathematics and (ii) Social Studies and Science.&#13;
Developing the curriculum on a subject basis, rather than a grade level basis, allows for more integration&#13;
of the curriculum between grades.&#13;
11    The CIMAT would comprise of (i) a senior subject specialist (team leader) and subject&#13;
specialists from CDIU; (ii) seven practicing teachers, including a reading specialist, representing all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
school types, and (iii) when needed, a methodology tutor from NCERD's Learning Resources Unit and&#13;
staff from the Test Development Unit. The CIMAT would: (i) finalize broad curriculum statements and&#13;
develop detailed curriculum based on the review of existing curriculum and instructional materials&#13;
available both domestically and internationally; (ii) develop and update a list of books and instructional&#13;
materials; (iii) if necessary, develop additional instructional materials where no existing materials were&#13;
considered to be appropriate; and (iv) assist the field supervision teams. Each CIMAT would be&#13;
expected to confer with curriculum specialists in the other core subjects, particularly the members of&#13;
other CIMATs as they are formed, in order to develop consistent cross-curricular elements. The project&#13;
would fund external curriculum and subject specialists who would (i) organize workshops on curriculum&#13;
design and development; (ii) visit Guyana approximately every two to three months to supervise&#13;
preparation of curriculum guides and (iii) provide assistance to supervision teams.. Professional&#13;
development opportunities, i.e. study tours, conferences for curriculum specialists would be financed by&#13;
the project in order to develop the capacity of NCERD.&#13;
12.    The final guides and instructional materials would be distributed to all schools, however only the&#13;
pilot schools would receive technical and supervisory support from the project. Other schools would&#13;
depend on principals and teachers to assist in the proper delivery of the new curriculum.&#13;
IN SER VICE TEA CHER TRAINING&#13;
13.    The effectiveness of the common curriculum, or any other curriculum, is clearly dependent upon&#13;
the teachers' knowledge of the subject matter and appropriate pedagogical skills. A large percentage of&#13;
the current teaching force of Guyana lacks appropriate training. The reasons for the low productivity in&#13;
the classroom appear to be related to (i) poor teacher subject knowledge; (ii) insufficient pedagogical&#13;
skills; (iii) lack of instructional materials; (iv) low salaries despite recent increases; and (v) absence of a&#13;
school team approach to teaching. Qualified teachers and administrators have either moved to the&#13;
private sector where salaries are better or left the country.&#13;
14.    Classroom observations in the CHS/PT schools indicate that teachers, irrespective of subject&#13;
matter or grade, have a very passive approach to teaching. Students were seated at their desks copying&#13;
passages, exercises or problems the teachers had written on the board. Teachers remained seated either&#13;
observing students or doing other work. Very little lecturing, explaining, demonstrating or discussing&#13;
the subject or circulating among students to check on student progress takes place. Group work, role&#13;
playing, experimentation, discussions or project work is not common. As a result, the time students&#13;
spent actually involved in learning appears to be significantly less than the actual class period. Review&#13;
of teachers' weekly Scheme Books reveal limited content coverage indicating that less than the formal&#13;
curriculum is being followed.&#13;
15.    Although curriculum development would take several years, teacher improvement programs&#13;
would be initiated as soon as possible. The project would contract the in-service teacher training to a&#13;
training institute acceptable to IDA, where, under the direction of the Project Director, a training&#13;
program would be developed in collaboration with other education institutions. External consultants&#13;
would assist in the development, preparation and implementation of in-service training programs and the&#13;
training of field supervisors. The technical assistance would also strengthen the training institute,&#13;
NCERD and supervision teams. The Project Director, in collaboration with the ACEO/Secondary, would&#13;
coordinate teacher training activities with other project components.&#13;
16     All pilot school head-teachers and teachers would participate in the in-service training activities&#13;
which would focus on subject content, use of learning resources, classroom and administrative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
management and pedagogical skills. Other training instruments would include study tours, fellowships&#13;
and conferences to familiarize curriculum specialists with current education trends and philosophies.&#13;
The teachers would also participate in workshops on time management, administration and teams&#13;
leaderships along with principals and other administrators.&#13;
17.   In-service training would include: (i) a twelve (12) day summer residential workshop for&#13;
teachers; (ii) a 10-day summer residential program for head teachers and deputy head teachers; (iii)&#13;
monthly content and methodology workshops, servicing a cluster of pilot schools at a time, for teachers&#13;
throughout the academic year; (iv) school-based training activities convened by the supervision teams;&#13;
and (v) regular school and classroom supervision and technical support.&#13;
SUPERVISION TEAM&#13;
18    The success of any curriculum reform rests on the ability of each school to absorb change and&#13;
adopt new approaches to teaching and learning. However, this includes not only pedagogical skills but&#13;
also planning and management at school/teacher level. Along these lines, strong supervision and&#13;
technical support is key to developing and maintaining quality teaching and learning. At present, this&#13;
does not exist in Guyana. Teachers and schools receive very little technical support which contributes&#13;
further to very low productivity in the classroom given the high proportion of untrained teachers.&#13;
19    The project would finance three supervision teams to provide continuing curriculum support and&#13;
training to the pilot schools. Supervision methodologies and strategies would be designed and developed&#13;
collaboratively by supervision teams, NCERD, the Project Director, the ACEO/Secondary and the&#13;
training institute. Internationally recruited consultants (in teacher training, curriculum development,&#13;
subject specialists, and performance assessment) would assist in developing, and implementing training&#13;
programs in effective classroom observation and supervision techniques as well as monitoring&#13;
supervision teams in the field approximately every 3 to 4 months.&#13;
20     The project, under the management of the Project Director, would finance three supervision&#13;
teams per subject, comprised of a teaching training specialist (team leader), subject specialists (Reading&#13;
and Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies), a DEO or DES from the district of the&#13;
pilot school, and periodically, a member of the Inspectorate. Supervision would include hands-on&#13;
assistance to teachers and administrators in classroom observation, motivation and discipline techniques,&#13;
new curriculum emphases, use of appropriate materials, student assessment methodologies, development&#13;
of student feedback mechanisms, record keeping, collaborative teaching methods etc. Supervision teams&#13;
would: (i) visit schools every six weeks for 2 days (totaling 32 days per pilot school per year); (ii)&#13;
prepare 2 supervision reports each semester for the review of the Project Director, ACEO/Secondary and&#13;
REdOs; (iii) collaborate with other supervision teams and the CDIU to identify training needs and&#13;
prepare training materials.&#13;
21.    Student learning outcomes woud be measured through continuous assessment techniques.&#13;
Initially monitoring indicators would include results from a set of diagnostic tests and supplemented by&#13;
other baseline information included in School Improvement Plans. Those indicators would be veryfied&#13;
by the supervision teams. In addition, the TDU would: (i) develop diagnostic tests; (ii) collaborate with&#13;
supervision teams in assisting pilot school teachers in continuous assessment; and (iii) develop a Form&#13;
III assessment test. The project secretariat would assume overall responsibility for monitoring these&#13;
activities.&#13;

SECONDARY SCHOOL REFORM PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX VII: MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
1.    Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are needed to ensure effective use of project inputs in&#13;
developing revitalized, more efficient pilot schools and to provide continuous feedback for the schools,&#13;
concerned government agencies and IDA. These mechanisms would assess changes in the quality of&#13;
educational processes and environments and the resulting changes in student performance.&#13;
2.    Evaluation of the project would be done periodically as part of the semi-annual reporting to IDA&#13;
by the Project Secretariat. The project would also have a mid-term review conducted by the Project&#13;
Secretariat after three years and six months. This review would be an input into IDA's Mid-Term&#13;
Review. Preparatory work and documentation, which would include the design of the review, would be&#13;
contracted out to an independent organization acceptable to IDA. The review would evaluate the&#13;
performance of the pilot schools, of project management and of the curriculum, training, textbook, civil&#13;
works, public awareness and institutional strengthening activities of the project. Independent input into&#13;
the Mid-Term Review would be essential in order to assess Guyana's capacity to implement and sustain&#13;
an effective country-wide secondary school reform program, design subsequent phases of the reform&#13;
program and provide a rationale for or against continued IDA assistance. Additional monitoring of the&#13;
project would be conducted by IDA supervision missions. Report due dates and a tentative schedule of&#13;
IDA supervision missions are presented in Table 3.&#13;
3.    Evaluation of pilot school performance would make use of baseline information developed by&#13;
the specialist in school-based management, who would be working with individual schools in developing&#13;
their SIPs. This information would be in the form of an analytical report presenting quantitative and&#13;
qualitative information about the pilot schools as of the beginning of the project. Evaluation of pilot&#13;
school performance would be based on assessment of changes in classroom, school and community&#13;
indicators in the pilot schools) by the project's pilot-school supervision teams, which would visit pilot&#13;
schools approximately every six weeks to monitor progress at the school level (see below). Student&#13;
performance, based on a set of desired learning outcomes developed in the ongoing UNICEF-funded&#13;
Minimum Levels of Attainment project, would be assessed through continuous assessment mechanisms&#13;
built into the curriculum and the teacher training components of the project. Supervision team reports&#13;
would be submitted to the Project Director, the ACEO Secondary and the school's REdO.&#13;

school-based initiatives and community participation; (e) assist the preparation of a School Improvement&#13;
Plan (SIP); and (f) provide direct financial assistance in a small amount to individual schools, based on&#13;
the evaluation of SIPs on competitive bases.&#13;
3.    The School Environment component would carry out comprehensive rehabilitation of 12 pilot&#13;

notify/advertise procedures, identify potential suppliers, and prepare short lists of potential contractors;&#13;
and (iii) assist the MEC in the receipt, opening and evaluation of bids, carry out post qualification of&#13;
bidders, and prepare bid evaluation reports to be submitted to the relevant Government authorities and&#13;
financiers for concurrence.&#13;
6.    For the selection of and contracting with consultants, the consultant will: (i) prepare terms of&#13;
reference, proposed short lists, letters of invitation for proposals, questionnaires, draft contracts etc.; (ii)&#13;

8.     The consultant should be an experienced professional, preferable with a technical background&#13;
and with extensive experience in all facets of large and complex international procurement, consultant&#13;
evaluation and selection and contract administration in multilaterally funded operations. The consultant&#13;
should also have a good knowledge of banking procedures linked to trade financing and of shipment and&#13;
insurance practices. Experience in training would be desirable. The consultant should have excellent&#13;
command of English. Access to an overseas home office to provide specific expert advise, if required,&#13;
would also be desirable. To ensure the impartiality of his/her advise, the consultant (including his or her&#13;
home office, if any) must not in any way be affiliated with business entities that are currently providing,&#13;
or are seeking to provide, other goods or services to Guyana.&#13;

            Guyana - Secondary School Reform Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary objective of the Secondary
            School Reform Project is to assist the government to
            initiate a long-term, multiphased education reform program
            to improve quality, relevance, equity and efficiency to
            secondary education in Guyana. More specifically, the
            project will aim to: 1) develop measures to improve the
            quality and efficiency of lower secondary education and test
            them at a limited number of schools in order to gain
            acceptance before extending the reform to the rest of the
            system; 2) improve the school environment by supporting
            rehabilitation and repair of schools; and 3) enhance the
            ability of national and regional institutions to design,
            plan for, and implement sustainable education reforms. The
            project will have the following three components: 1)
            educational program quality, including support to school
            management, training of principals, deputy principals and
            department heads, introduction of a common curriculum,
            provision of textbooks and other instructional materials,
            in-service teacher training, supervision and performance
            monitoring; 2) school environment comprising a pilot schools
            subcomponent and an emergency school repair subcomponent;
            and 3) national and regional institutional strengthening
            including institutional strengthening, project management,
            budget planning, organization and management, nationwide
            physical facilities survey, school information system and a
            social awareness campaign.
