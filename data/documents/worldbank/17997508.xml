Interview # 1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You are Mr. Morton M. Mendels, and you came to the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
what year?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   1946.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Before that. . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Before that I practiced law in Montreal, both before,&#13;
&#13;
and for a few months after, World War II.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How did you happen to come to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   That was a long story.   During the war years I spent&#13;
&#13;
most of my time on the Canadian General Staff in Ottawa, where I&#13;
&#13;
was concerned largely with the management of the Canadian Armyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
money.   My annual arguments with the Treasury Board there were&#13;
&#13;
apparently sufficient to produce my nomination as Secretary of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank when Mr. Meyer asked the then Canadian representative&#13;
&#13;
for what he called a young Canadian lawyer for the job.   Iâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
been here since.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 1 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When you came to the Bank you assumed the office of Secretary&#13;
&#13;
immediately?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    That is correct.   Prior to my coming, and since the&#13;
&#13;
meeting in Savannah, Mr. John S. Hooker, who was until recently&#13;
&#13;
the alternate U.S. Director in the Bank and still is the&#13;
&#13;
alternate U.S. Director in the Fund, was temporary Secretary of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you recall some of the early meetings with the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors which might be useful for us to know about in&#13;
&#13;
connection with the development of the policies of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    I think that the early meetings of the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors of the Bank represented a formative period.    It was&#13;
&#13;
found by those who were here at the beginning of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
operations that many of the preconceptions were not entirely&#13;
&#13;
accurate.    The Bank did not possess the kind of resources that&#13;
&#13;
people visualized when they talked about a $10 billion bank.       It&#13;
&#13;
certainly did not have lending policies nor borrowing policies,&#13;
&#13;
and it had no people nor officers when it began.    Among the first&#13;
&#13;
comers to the Bank in the spring and summer of â&#128;&#153;46 were some of&#13;
&#13;
the Executive Directors who had been elected in Savannah during&#13;
&#13;
March of that year and some of the Directors who had been&#13;
&#13;
appointed.   In planning their course of action they held many&#13;
&#13;
meetings and discussed a very broad range of subjects that in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 2 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
their opinion had to be decided in order that the Bank make some&#13;
&#13;
progress.   With so little to go on, it is easy to see that a&#13;
&#13;
great many of the meetings and discussions which took place did&#13;
&#13;
not result in many concrete or approved policies.    But, there&#13;
&#13;
were numerous meetings.   The Executive Directors divided&#13;
&#13;
themselves up into numerous committees, most of which, it must be&#13;
&#13;
said, were not very productive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Youâ&#128;&#153;re talking now about the period before a President was&#13;
&#13;
appointed at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    And shortly after.   Iâ&#128;&#153;m talking about both the period&#13;
&#13;
just prior to the appointment of Mr. Meyer, when it might be said&#13;
&#13;
that there was no management and people were feeling their way&#13;
&#13;
into the future, and also the period after Mr. Meyers, which,&#13;
&#13;
while it produced some of the officers of the Bank and some&#13;
&#13;
clear-cut paths were cut, nevertheless so far as the Board in its&#13;
&#13;
decisive role was concerned, the same amount of feeling its way,&#13;
&#13;
the same amount of circuitous discussions and the attempt to&#13;
&#13;
define policies was continued.    There were innumerable meetings,&#13;
&#13;
and it was difficult at that time to prevent borrowers and&#13;
&#13;
lenders from lining up in opposing camps when we touched upon&#13;
&#13;
some fundamental policy of the Bank.     For example, discussions&#13;
&#13;
regarding rate of interest that the Bank would charge on its&#13;
&#13;
loans are a clear example of the kind of discussion where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 3 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
borrower and lender soon found themselves on opposite sides of&#13;
&#13;
the fence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were any actual applications for loans received in this early&#13;
&#13;
stage?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   That depends upon what is an application.   Some of the&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors had come from their countries with thoughts&#13;
&#13;
of loans which might be made to their own countries.   Some&#13;
&#13;
countries, like Chile, had made it known to the Bank that they&#13;
&#13;
had an application, and the application came in early.    In other&#13;
&#13;
cases there were discussions which might or might not be termed&#13;
&#13;
applications.   Even today the word â&#128;&#156;loan applicationâ&#128;? is not&#13;
&#13;
often used in the Bank.   The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s area people become&#13;
&#13;
sufficiently familiar with their countries to be able to march&#13;
&#13;
along with the countryâ&#128;&#153;s officials and between them mutually&#13;
&#13;
agree from time to time on what is suitable for financing in the&#13;
&#13;
light of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s development; so that formal applications&#13;
&#13;
asking for loans are rare things.&#13;
&#13;
      It was known, however, as early as the summer and fall of&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#153;46 that some countries like Chile, possibly France and others,&#13;
&#13;
had it in mind to obtain financing from the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      In other cases, like Czechoslovakia, I believe it was, it&#13;
&#13;
was as simple a matter as sending in a letter of a few lines to&#13;
&#13;
the Bank asking for a mere $500 million for reconstruction and&#13;
&#13;
development.    So that while one cannot speak of applications as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 4 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
such, there were indications that requests for financing would be&#13;
&#13;
available to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What sort of discussions did the Executive Directors have&#13;
&#13;
about these, or did they simply decide to wait until there was a&#13;
&#13;
president?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Itâ&#128;&#153;s my recollection that there were discussions on&#13;
&#13;
loan policy, on administration, on certain interpretations of&#13;
&#13;
articles of agreement, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Does this imply there was a legal staff already even before&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Meyer arrived?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   This I cannot be certain of since I myself was not here&#13;
&#13;
before Mr. Meyer arrived in June of â&#128;&#153;46, and Iâ&#128;&#153;m not quite sure&#13;
&#13;
when Mr. Luxford, who later became assistant general counsel of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, came.   The general counsel, Mr. McLain, I think came&#13;
&#13;
shortly after the first President, Mr. Meyer.   It was Mr. Meyer&#13;
&#13;
who really chose the first key officers of the Bank, but that did&#13;
&#13;
not prevent the Executive Directors who were present from&#13;
&#13;
initiating the beginning of discussionsâ&#128;&#148;for example, the&#13;
&#13;
discussions on following up the two per cent and the 18 per cent&#13;
&#13;
subscription calls.   Those discussions were initiated early,&#13;
&#13;
because it was recognized that action would be needed early.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 5 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      It should also be remembered in discussing the work of the&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors before Mr. Meyer came that there were among&#13;
&#13;
the early comers some very strong personalities.    Mr. Collado of&#13;
&#13;
the United States, Sir James Grigg of the United Kingdom, Willem&#13;
&#13;
Beyen of the Netherlands, I think it was Mendes-France for a time&#13;
&#13;
for France in those early days, Bryce of Canada, now Secretary of&#13;
&#13;
the Treasury Board in Canada, and some others.   These men were&#13;
&#13;
hardly the sort to sit by even while waiting for the appointment&#13;
&#13;
of the President and do nothing about this novel and important&#13;
&#13;
institution on whose policy board they were sitting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a question about the time period here.   The Fund, I&#13;
&#13;
think, appointed or elected a managing director at Savannah, but&#13;
&#13;
there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a president of the Bank for a couple of months after&#13;
&#13;
Savannah.   What was the reason for the delay in getting the&#13;
&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s management started?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that it can be said that the Fund elected&#13;
&#13;
their managing director.   I mean the managing director of the&#13;
&#13;
Fund was chosen the same way as the President of the Bank.     Itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
true to say that heâ&#128;&#153;s selected by the Executive Directors.     I&#13;
&#13;
think one reason was that Camille Gutt, who was chosen managing&#13;
&#13;
director of the Fund, was present as Belgian Executive Director&#13;
&#13;
and therefore was available; and since he turned out to be the&#13;
&#13;
choice, it was possible to move earlier than in the case of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank where I donâ&#128;&#153;t think sufficient attention had up to then been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 6 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
given to personalities.   I do think that it had probably been&#13;
&#13;
agreed that the president of the Bank would be an American&#13;
&#13;
citizen.   As a matter of fact, that had been the tacit&#13;
&#13;
understanding from that time to this.   And this meant that the&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors left it to their U.S. colleagues to nominate,&#13;
&#13;
and it was also fairly certain that any nomination made by the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. executive director would probably be acceptable to the rest&#13;
&#13;
of the Executive Directors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What was the reason for the understanding?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   I can only conclude that if there was no earlier&#13;
&#13;
action, then the U.S. was not prepared to make its nomination any&#13;
&#13;
sooner than it did.   And in such cases, it is never easy to make&#13;
&#13;
single choice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you know anything about the action of the United States in&#13;
&#13;
searching for a president at this point?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Not in the case of Mr. Meyer.     That all happened before&#13;
&#13;
my time.   I do not even know that it was much or little of a&#13;
&#13;
search.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I wonder if you can tell a little about Mr. Meyersâ&#128;&#153; term in&#13;
&#13;
office.    What did he do when he arrived?   How did he recruit his&#13;
&#13;
staff?    What sort of policy questions arose?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 7 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   This is a subject upon which I believe that both&#13;
&#13;
Richard Demuth, who is still with us, and John Ferguson, no&#13;
&#13;
longer with us, both of whom were in 1946 assistants to Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Meyer, could give more information.     From my observation, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Meyer had several accomplishments to his credit.    In the first&#13;
&#13;
place, he apparently came to the conclusion that the way to&#13;
&#13;
organize the staff of a Bank, particularly since wide&#13;
&#13;
geographical distribution was desirable, was to decide the&#13;
&#13;
departmental shape of the Bank and then find department heads&#13;
&#13;
from designated areas or countries.     In this way he concluded&#13;
&#13;
that he would have an economic department headed by a French&#13;
&#13;
citizen; that a treasurerâ&#128;&#153;s department would be headed by a Dutch&#13;
&#13;
citizen, (pause in recording)&#13;
&#13;
     I was saying that his plan seemed to have been to define&#13;
&#13;
his departments, find his department heads, bearing geographical&#13;
&#13;
distribution in mind, and then allow those department heads to&#13;
&#13;
fill out their departments in the light of what they thought&#13;
&#13;
their requirements were.   I also said that he had decided upon a&#13;
&#13;
French Economic Director, a Dutch Treasurer, a Canadian&#13;
&#13;
Secretaryâ&#128;&#148;myself, an American General Counsel; one director, who&#13;
&#13;
was at first temporarily Mr. Beyen, the Dutch director, who was&#13;
&#13;
succeeded also for a short time by Mr. C. C. Pineo, a Canadian,&#13;
&#13;
and eventually the post went on a permanent basis to the then Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Iliff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 8 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there any particular reason for selecting these&#13;
&#13;
nationalities or was it simply that he wanted to get an&#13;
&#13;
international staff and he happened to find people from these&#13;
&#13;
various countries?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Well, the general approach was to have as broadly an&#13;
&#13;
international staff as he could find consonant with the requisite&#13;
&#13;
abilities in the particular posts.     I think his choices were&#13;
&#13;
influenced to some degree, not in my own case of course, by&#13;
&#13;
knowing the people that he would favorably consider.    By this I&#13;
&#13;
mean that in the case of economic directors, he must have had his&#13;
&#13;
eye on Mr. Leonard Rist, who had been sent to the Board as&#13;
&#13;
Alternate Director by France at a time when he, Mr. Meyer, made&#13;
&#13;
the decision that a French Economic Director was desirable.       But&#13;
&#13;
this meant that another Frenchman, for example, would not be&#13;
&#13;
favored.   And there, too, Mr. Meyer must have had his eye on Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Crena de Iongh, the Dutch alternate director at the time when he&#13;
&#13;
was planning the departmental set-up.    So I think that the play&#13;
&#13;
of personalities as well as organization had an important bearing&#13;
&#13;
in Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s mind.&#13;
&#13;
      However, to get back to the list of what I consider Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s accomplishments, there is first this basic primary&#13;
&#13;
organization of the Bank, which, while it has expanded, has&#13;
&#13;
nevertheless retained the basic dimensions of that time.&#13;
&#13;
      Secondly, I think itâ&#128;&#153;s only fair to say that Mr. Meyer&#13;
&#13;
prompted the beginnings that were made to define and determine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 9 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
what the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s operations were likely to be in both the lending&#13;
&#13;
and the borrowing fields.   To take the second one first, while no&#13;
&#13;
borrowing was done, and one might even say no clear-cut policies&#13;
&#13;
enunciated, nevertheless Mr. Meyer arranged with a great many&#13;
&#13;
important figures in the business and banking worlds to have an&#13;
&#13;
advisory committee that would assist the Bank in its borrowing&#13;
&#13;
plans and in its borrowing programs.    While this committee never&#13;
&#13;
became an important cog in the machine, no doubt in the many&#13;
&#13;
conversations that took place between the businessman and bankers&#13;
&#13;
whom Mr. Meyer approached and himself and some of the staff that&#13;
&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s first plans with regard to the issues of â&#128;&#153;47 were&#13;
&#13;
first evolved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The council was composed of people from outside. . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Outside the Bank; the New York financial community and&#13;
&#13;
places of that sort.   It never became a firm continuing body, but&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Meyer at least sought out the ways and means to start the&#13;
&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s borrowing, and Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure learned a good deal from these&#13;
&#13;
advisers, even if it was of things not to do.&#13;
&#13;
      Similarly, in the lending field, with which the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors representing potential borrowing countries were more&#13;
&#13;
concerned, Mr. Meyer did help to initiate a great many&#13;
&#13;
discussions that ultimately culminated in what one might call the&#13;
&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s lending policies.    It is true that such policies were&#13;
&#13;
clearly enunciated only after Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s tenure of office, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 10 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the beginnings for the later enunciation in Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s term.&#13;
&#13;
And as I said earlier, there were endless discussions among the&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors and their committees about the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s loan&#13;
&#13;
policies; and while by far the larger part of such discussions&#13;
&#13;
produced no real results, nevertheless this was background out of&#13;
&#13;
which came the later accepted lending policies of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   There was nothing that developed later that was contrary to&#13;
&#13;
any of these policy recommendations, so to speak, which took&#13;
&#13;
place in these early discussions?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   I canâ&#128;&#153;t be sure.   I donâ&#128;&#153;t think so.   As a matter of&#13;
&#13;
fact, to use an example, quite a few Executive Directors came to&#13;
&#13;
the Bank with the idea of what is called the loan basket.    This&#13;
&#13;
meant that they believed that the Bank would function by totaling&#13;
&#13;
up its available lendable resources and then on some formula to&#13;
&#13;
be adopted would set portions by different areas and by different&#13;
&#13;
countries.   Each country would be entitled to a certain portion&#13;
&#13;
of the available resources, and presumably, when that was gone,&#13;
&#13;
further resources would only become available when the Bank had&#13;
&#13;
obtained further resources, if it did.   It was in the early Meyer&#13;
&#13;
period that this idea both arose and disappeared.    It was obvious&#13;
&#13;
that this was not the basis on which the Bank was to work, that&#13;
&#13;
this was not consistent with the project approach, and that any&#13;
&#13;
philosophy of this kind could not persist if the Bank proved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 11 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
itself able to obtain additional resources in the way foreseen.&#13;
&#13;
If it didnâ&#128;&#153;t, it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t going to be successful anyhow.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You say it was obvious.   How did the discussion get started&#13;
&#13;
in the first place?    Was it just a misunderstanding on the part&#13;
&#13;
of the directors?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   I think it was a natural misunderstanding on the part&#13;
&#13;
of some of the directors as they all groped for ways in which the&#13;
&#13;
Bank was to work.   It was an easy ready idea to say, â&#128;&#156;So much for&#13;
&#13;
each country that could be classed as a developing country.â&#128;?    But&#13;
&#13;
I would not like to have this overemphasized.   As I say, the idea&#13;
&#13;
arose and dismissed.   I mention it only to indicate some basis&#13;
&#13;
for what came later in clear-cut policies that are for the most&#13;
&#13;
part now still being followed.   It did stem to some degree from&#13;
&#13;
the earlier discussions which did not seem at that time to be&#13;
&#13;
very productive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   These discussions youâ&#128;&#153;re talking about, were they discussions&#13;
&#13;
on the part of members of the staff or were they discussions by&#13;
&#13;
the Executive Directors?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Technically they were discussions among the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors usually sitting in committee.   But every committee was&#13;
&#13;
serviced by different members of the staff and frequently had&#13;
&#13;
before the committee papers prepared either by the staff or by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 12 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
board members or by both.   Having so many sources of papers was&#13;
&#13;
one cause of confusion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So that the staff and directors were working very closely&#13;
&#13;
together.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    Very closely together.   It would have been difficult to&#13;
&#13;
distinguish jurisdictions at that time, but then there werenâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
enough people around to make that a problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did this working relationship between the directors and the&#13;
&#13;
staff continue throughout Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s regime or did it gradually&#13;
&#13;
change as more staff were added?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    I think as more staff was added, that it became more&#13;
&#13;
and more the tendency for the directors to call upon the staff&#13;
&#13;
more, and especially for the preparation of papers on particular&#13;
&#13;
questions; and they themselves no longer prepared papers as they&#13;
&#13;
had before.   I think they regarded the preparation of papers and&#13;
&#13;
the analysis of questions that such papers contained as a proper&#13;
&#13;
staff function in which some of them helped before there was&#13;
&#13;
sufficient staff.   I think that in the attempt to make a proper&#13;
&#13;
beginning of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s borrowing and lending, Mr. Meyer had his&#13;
&#13;
second great achievement.   And in both these fields, the&#13;
&#13;
organization of the Bank and the beginnings of some real thought&#13;
&#13;
about borrowing and lending, Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s term of service of about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 13 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
six months was short.    In other words, I think he did a great&#13;
&#13;
deal in the six months.    In some other ways he was not so&#13;
&#13;
successful.    I think in the relations of the Executive Directors&#13;
&#13;
among themselves he did not make much headway.    The play of&#13;
&#13;
personalitiesâ&#128;&#148;as I said earlier, there were some strong ones&#13;
&#13;
among the Executive Directorsâ&#128;&#148;was such that it might have been&#13;
&#13;
difficult at times to distinguish just who was president of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank; and it was certainly difficult I think for some of the&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors to distinguish their own chairs from the&#13;
&#13;
chair of the President.    In this particular atmosphere Mr. Meyer&#13;
&#13;
was not as successful to my mind as in the two fields where Iâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
suggested that he was instrumental in accomplishment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there any impatience on the part of the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors with the speed with which the management was moving&#13;
&#13;
toward making loans?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Yes, but this is not easily definable.    The Executive&#13;
&#13;
Director representing Chile, which considered that it had an&#13;
&#13;
application pending, was very impatient.    The Executive Director&#13;
&#13;
representing France, which had an application for $500 million&#13;
&#13;
in, was very impatient so far as the beginning of lending was&#13;
&#13;
concerned.    Those Executive Directors that did not represent&#13;
&#13;
countries with applications were not quite so impatient.      The&#13;
&#13;
directors generally appreciated the fact that the Bank would not&#13;
&#13;
start making loans in a complete vacuum, although there seemed to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 14 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
be an equally general understanding that the Bank was not going&#13;
&#13;
to lay down a whole body of doctrine in a vacuum and then proceed&#13;
&#13;
to administer that doctrine.    It was clear that operations were&#13;
&#13;
going to go from loan to loan, and policies in general would be&#13;
&#13;
established in that manner.    However, that did not fix the rate&#13;
&#13;
of interest for the first loan, nor did it provide the covenants&#13;
&#13;
for the first loan agreement.    Some decisions had to be made, and&#13;
&#13;
with respect to the making of those decisions I think there was&#13;
&#13;
some impatience.   You must remember that for an organization such&#13;
&#13;
as the Bank, no matter what trials it went through, to have begun&#13;
&#13;
operations on June 25, â&#128;&#153;46, and to have made a first loan of $250&#13;
&#13;
million to France less than a year later, to have borrowed $250&#13;
&#13;
million a little over a year later is not a bad record no matter&#13;
&#13;
what may have gone on behind the scenes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When you mentioned that the French and the Chileans regarded&#13;
&#13;
their applications as having been in, what did you meanâ&#128;&#148;what&#13;
&#13;
statement of applications and did the management feel that they&#13;
&#13;
were adequately prepared?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that the management knew yet.   In other&#13;
&#13;
words, both because of staff limitations, policy limitations in&#13;
&#13;
the sense that the way to make a loan had not yet been defined,&#13;
&#13;
in those senses, the applications had not been fully&#13;
&#13;
investigated.   The French application was a reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
application of $500 million.    There was no question that France&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 15 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
had undergone a great deal of destruction.    But the French&#13;
&#13;
application, for example, was a combination of sector assistance&#13;
&#13;
and projects.    Well, the question of lending in sectors is a&#13;
&#13;
question that has dogged the Bank from then till now.   The Bank&#13;
&#13;
is supposed to follow the project approach.    Sector lending takes&#13;
&#13;
you away from the project approach somewhat.   The question of&#13;
&#13;
whether or not sectors in the French program were acceptable I&#13;
&#13;
think was the major question both for policy and investigation.&#13;
&#13;
      The Chilean applications, as I remember it, appeared in the&#13;
&#13;
form of various large volumes of all kinds and was for an amount&#13;
&#13;
much greater than was lent much later.&#13;
&#13;
      So the question of investigating applications at that time&#13;
&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t at the bottom of any impatience.   I donâ&#128;&#153;t think there was&#13;
&#13;
any specific reason for the impatience except the fact that you&#13;
&#13;
had representatives of African countries who wanted to turn in a&#13;
&#13;
good show and wanting to produce some results.   They could be&#13;
&#13;
forgiven for expecting loans quickly, just as others could be&#13;
&#13;
forgiven for saying that the kinds of loans that the Bank would&#13;
&#13;
make would require a great deal of time and effort before they&#13;
&#13;
could be made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Who were some of the people that were very important on the&#13;
&#13;
staff during Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s term in office and what sort of&#13;
&#13;
contributions did they make?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 16 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   I mentioned Mr. Ferguson, who was with the Bank only a&#13;
&#13;
short time as an assistant to Mr. Meyer; Mr. Demuth, who is still&#13;
&#13;
with the Bank and who has made a great contribution; Mr. Chester&#13;
&#13;
McLain, general counsel; Leonard Rist, economic director until&#13;
&#13;
very recently and now the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s special representative in&#13;
&#13;
Africa; Mr. Crena de Iongh, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s first treasurer; Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Luxford, one of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s former assistant general counsels; Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Harold Smith, the first vice-president of the Bank, formerly a&#13;
&#13;
director of the U.S. Bureau of the Budget.    I think these were&#13;
&#13;
all men who made contributions to the early formative days of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.   I think one could also list the names of persons like the&#13;
&#13;
present general counsel of the Bank, Mr. Aron Broches, who was&#13;
&#13;
with the Dutch delegation at Bretton Woods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Iâ&#128;&#153;ve heard from other sources that Mr. McLain was&#13;
&#13;
particularly influential in this early period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   He was.   He was well known to Mr. Meyer, who brought&#13;
&#13;
him in as general counsel.   As a matter of fact, he was well&#13;
&#13;
known also to Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s successor, Mr. McCloy.    He was a&#13;
&#13;
powerful personality and perhaps in view of the great confidence&#13;
&#13;
which Mr. Meyer and later Mr. McCloy had in him, the most&#13;
&#13;
important single architect of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s program of policies and&#13;
&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 17 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What was his attitude toward the general function of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
and also toward the importance of management of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   I think that McLain was a protagonist of strong&#13;
&#13;
management in this organization or any other.   He was an&#13;
&#13;
extremely competent lawyer who had risen high in his own field.&#13;
&#13;
His experience, so far as I know, had been largely in corporate&#13;
&#13;
legal activity, where I think he had an opportunity to see strong&#13;
&#13;
management work, especially since most of his experience was in&#13;
&#13;
the U.S.   I think also that it remained to be seen whether a&#13;
&#13;
creed of this kind would succeed in the Bank.   As it happens,&#13;
&#13;
just to bridge the years for a second, I think that the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
the one international organization which has what we call strong&#13;
&#13;
management.   I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that management had quite the same&#13;
&#13;
extensive authority in any other international organization.     Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
&#13;
not even sure that many of them have managements in the sense in&#13;
&#13;
which weâ&#128;&#153;re discussing.   But the Bank, as a result of its&#13;
&#13;
history, does have strong management.   And I think one of the&#13;
&#13;
strong contributions it will make to the whole field of&#13;
&#13;
international organizations is the fact that it is possible in&#13;
&#13;
this public domain, so to speak, to have strong management as it&#13;
&#13;
is practiced in corporate organizations successfully.&#13;
&#13;
      Mark you, I think that one of the sanctions of such strong&#13;
&#13;
management is the success of the organization itself because so&#13;
&#13;
long as it is successful, the responsibilities of Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors, who are the representatives of your members, are not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 18 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
so great as they would be if the Bank faced real problems of&#13;
&#13;
success or failure, with responsibilities much heavier on their&#13;
&#13;
shoulders.   But notwithstanding that, strong management has shown&#13;
&#13;
many advantages in terms of efficiency of operation, expedition&#13;
&#13;
of operation and so on.    Without strong management the Bank could&#13;
&#13;
not have covered the ground that it has covered in its short&#13;
&#13;
history.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Would you say that the precedent of having strong management&#13;
&#13;
had been accepted by the time Mr. Meyer resigned?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   No, not at all.   I think that strong management came&#13;
&#13;
into the Bank on March 17th, â&#128;&#153;47, with the advent of Messrs.&#13;
&#13;
McCloy, Garner, and Black.   I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that Mr. Meyer tried,&#13;
&#13;
nor do I know that he would have succeeded if he had tried, to&#13;
&#13;
have what we are calling strong management.   I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Meyer thought about it in those terms.    He was considerably&#13;
&#13;
more remote from modern industry.   He had retired in the â&#128;&#152;30s.&#13;
&#13;
But Mr. McCloy and Mr. Garner, when they came, came straight from&#13;
&#13;
commerce and banking and did believe strongly in such matters and&#13;
&#13;
I believe introduced it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there any comment on Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s resignation?   Was there&#13;
&#13;
any reason for this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 19 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   As you probably know, Mr. Meyer stated as his reason&#13;
&#13;
that he had given the Bank its basic organization, which I&#13;
&#13;
described earlier, and that from then on it would be a case of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank functioning and carrying on its activities and&#13;
&#13;
operations.    And in his mind it was better that the President of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank who would see the results of the operations that had&#13;
&#13;
begun should be the one to take over now, or rather at the time&#13;
&#13;
he resigned.    He gave as his reason that he was too old to stay&#13;
&#13;
much longer in any event, and he had picked this particular point&#13;
&#13;
of time in which to allow a successor who would remain longer at&#13;
&#13;
the Bank to take over.&#13;
&#13;
     This was regarded by many as not the entire story, though&#13;
&#13;
it was all that Mr. Meyer offered by way of explanation.    Rumor&#13;
&#13;
had it at the time that the principal reason for Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
resignation was his inability to get on with the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors and in particular, the U.S. executive director; I think&#13;
&#13;
I would also add the U.K. executive director and perhaps the&#13;
&#13;
Dutch.   Apparently the difficulty was one whereby Mr. Meyer could&#13;
&#13;
not persuade these strong directors to his way of thinking on&#13;
&#13;
different policies.    Nor could any one of the ones Iâ&#128;&#153;ve mentioned&#13;
&#13;
and possibly one or two others have persuaded Mr. Meyer and the&#13;
&#13;
rest as to their way of thinking.    This is perhaps the reason&#13;
&#13;
that the rumor grew that it was impossible for the Bank Board to&#13;
&#13;
operate as a successful unit, simply because the divergencies&#13;
&#13;
among the different national representatives could never be&#13;
&#13;
reconciled.    Certainly Mr. Meyer was reputed not to have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 20 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
able to reconcile them, and this is regarded by many as the real&#13;
&#13;
reason for his resignation.    To put it boldly, it was said that&#13;
&#13;
he could not control the U.S. executive director, and if he could&#13;
&#13;
not, then he could not control his job.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you illustrate the difference of opinion with reference&#13;
&#13;
to any particular issue?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    That would have to be dug up, but I think the best way&#13;
&#13;
to put it is more general.    Mr. Meyer came from a very successful&#13;
&#13;
career as an investment banker in New York, and he had amassed a&#13;
&#13;
fortune at his profession at an early age.      He knew the rules of&#13;
&#13;
business, and he knew how business operated, and he did consider&#13;
&#13;
in spite of what I said earlier about management that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
ought to be a successful business.       This was fine so far as it&#13;
&#13;
went.&#13;
&#13;
        On the other hand, the U.S. executive director at the time&#13;
&#13;
came out of the State Department at a time when it was clear that&#13;
&#13;
the world was going to be very needy and that the U.S. would have&#13;
&#13;
to fill the breach and I believe belonged to the school that&#13;
&#13;
accepted this role for the U.S. and therefore in terms of having&#13;
&#13;
the Bank become an institution that would be used chiefly to&#13;
&#13;
assist in reconstructing and developing the World, he was taking&#13;
&#13;
a position very different from the orthodox one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;

Interview # 2                                      July 24, 1961&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Mr. Mendels, the other day we were talking about the very&#13;
&#13;
early period of the Bank, and we ended, I believe, with the&#13;
&#13;
discussion of Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s resignation.    I wonder if we might&#13;
&#13;
start the tape today by having you tell a little bit about what&#13;
&#13;
was happening after Mr. Meyer resigned and before Mr. McCloy&#13;
&#13;
came.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    Mr. Meyer resigned around the middle of December, 1946,&#13;
&#13;
and gave as his reason the fact that he considered the time had&#13;
&#13;
been reached when he as architect of the general organization of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank should leave and that a successor who would be able to&#13;
&#13;
see the Bank through its early years, a much longer period than&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Meyer foresaw he could see the Bank through, should take&#13;
&#13;
over.    I think I mentioned earlier many of the people felt that&#13;
&#13;
while this may have been a true reason, it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t the whole&#13;
&#13;
story.    Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s resignation was attributed in many quarters&#13;
&#13;
to his inability to get along with certain Executive Directors,&#13;
&#13;
especially the U.S. executive director.    People who thought that&#13;
&#13;
also thought that that was the real reason for Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
resignation.&#13;
&#13;
        For some three weeks after Mr. Meyer resigned, Mr. Harold&#13;
&#13;
Smith, the vice-president of the Bank, tried to carry on but&#13;
&#13;
rather unsuccessfully in view of the attempt on the part of&#13;
&#13;
various Executive Directors, each in his own way, also to carry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 22 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
on.   The result was a great deal of confusion and rivalry, and&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Smith, a very likeable but not very strong personality, was&#13;
&#13;
unable in my opinion to manage the institution or to see that it&#13;
&#13;
proceeded to carry out its purposes.&#13;
&#13;
      The situation was complicated when early in January Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Smith suddenly died of a heart attack, and the Bank was without&#13;
&#13;
both president and vice-president.     I should say incidentally&#13;
&#13;
that Mr. Smith, during the three weeks preceding his death&#13;
&#13;
following Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s resignation, could not understand why the&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors considered it necessary to seek for a new&#13;
&#13;
president.   He did think that he was the logical candidate.       Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
&#13;
afraid that no one else thought so, and it was only immediately&#13;
&#13;
prior to his death that I believe Mr. Smith himself became aware&#13;
&#13;
of the fact that he was not going to be a candidate for the&#13;
&#13;
presidency of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      With Mr. Smithâ&#128;&#153;s death, of course, the lack of direction&#13;
&#13;
became even more markedâ&#128;&#148;this in January of â&#128;&#153;47.    It seemed to be&#13;
&#13;
understood that the U.S. executive director was expected to&#13;
&#13;
produce the names of acceptable U.S. citizens to be considered by&#13;
&#13;
the remainder of the Executive Directors for the presidency.       On&#13;
&#13;
the U.S. side this was complicated, according to some opinions,&#13;
&#13;
by the fact that the U.S. director himself had ambitions in that&#13;
&#13;
direction.   As a matter of fact, I might add that the U.K.&#13;
&#13;
executive director, Sir James Grigg, possibly the Dutch director,&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Beyen, were also considered in different quarters to have&#13;
&#13;
similar ambitious.   With the most powerful men among the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 23 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
directors alleged to have these ambitions, it was pretty&#13;
&#13;
difficult to see to the actual work of the Bank on a day-to-day&#13;
&#13;
basisâ&#128;&#148;no president, no vice-president and the Executive Directors&#13;
&#13;
reputedly vying among themselves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   One question.   The very fact that there was no candidate to&#13;
&#13;
replace Mr. Meyer suggests perhaps that Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s resignation was&#13;
&#13;
quite unexpected when it did come.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   It was, and because, as Iâ&#128;&#153;ve already suggested, he was&#13;
&#13;
suspected of not giving the real reason, the alleged real reason&#13;
&#13;
later got a great deal of emphasis, and, as a matter of fact, was&#13;
&#13;
subsequently picked up in the press and underscored when, as time&#13;
&#13;
went on, it became clear that there was difficulty in finding a&#13;
&#13;
suitable candidate for the presidency.    I might just say here&#13;
&#13;
that the reason given in much of the press was that this new&#13;
&#13;
organization with its type of international board of directors&#13;
&#13;
could not be expected to be successful.   I think Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
whole position here seemed to give a basis which was steadily&#13;
&#13;
gaining currencyâ&#128;&#148;that the Executive Directors of the Bank, at&#13;
&#13;
that time 12, representing at that time 40 odd countries,&#13;
&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#153;t ever possibly agree on almost any question the Bank&#13;
&#13;
would have to cope with.   The conflict of interest at the Board&#13;
&#13;
table seemed in the circumstances at that time to be just too&#13;
&#13;
clear.   In other words, it was frequently thought that on any&#13;
&#13;
basic question of policy you would immediately have a lendersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 24 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
club and a borrowersâ&#128;&#153; club around the Board table.    And while the&#13;
&#13;
lendersâ&#128;&#153; club, under the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s weighted system of voting, could&#13;
&#13;
always have its way by majority of votes, nonetheless it was not&#13;
&#13;
expected to be the way in which the Bank would work.    It had been&#13;
&#13;
established in order that the lenders might help the borrowers in&#13;
&#13;
their development, and therefore the question of exercising votes&#13;
&#13;
alone in order to have their way was not a question that was&#13;
&#13;
seriously considered within the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
        However, with that basic division, and perhaps some other&#13;
&#13;
divisions based on geographical and other affinities, it was easy&#13;
&#13;
to see in 1947 how the rumor would spread that this kind of an&#13;
&#13;
international board couldnâ&#128;&#153;t ever work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you have any idea whether Mr. Meyer was taking his case,&#13;
&#13;
so to speak, to Wall Street directly through conversations with&#13;
&#13;
people?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    Not at that time in my opinion, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t really&#13;
&#13;
know.    I think Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#148;and this is pure conjectureâ&#128;&#148;would bide&#13;
&#13;
his time and would have been certain to talk to any candidate&#13;
&#13;
that he thought might get the post, one might say almost&#13;
&#13;
indoctrinate such candidate in order that the same mistakes, as&#13;
&#13;
he would regard them, would not be made by the candidate as he,&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Meyer, fell into.    I think he would probably have recommended&#13;
&#13;
that a firmer direction to the Board by whatever method of rather&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 25 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
greater control of the Board was desirableâ&#128;&#148;this from his own lack&#13;
&#13;
of these things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you know whether he had any personal conversations with&#13;
&#13;
Mr. McCloy after he resigned?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    I believe he did, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t know.   From his&#13;
&#13;
conversations with me I know that Mr. Meyer was keen that any&#13;
&#13;
successor of his should be aware of the pitfalls that he himself&#13;
&#13;
felt he had fallen into.    And it is a bit of a presumption that&#13;
&#13;
he had talks with Mr. McCloy, because they were old friends, so&#13;
&#13;
far as I know, and with the general counsel for the Bank, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
McLain, had all been known to each other over an extensive&#13;
&#13;
period.&#13;
&#13;
      To get back to the Bank, there the Bank wasâ&#128;&#148;no president,&#13;
&#13;
no vice-president, a group of competing Executive Directors,&#13;
&#13;
competing either for position or influence or both, no real&#13;
&#13;
direction at all for what turned out to be the better part of&#13;
&#13;
three months.    Some measures had to be taken, I would say, to&#13;
&#13;
prevent the Bank from closing its doors.    There was an adverse&#13;
&#13;
press.    Adverse comments on the Bank were gaining currency,&#13;
&#13;
gaining strength, all the time.    Candidates that were mentioned&#13;
&#13;
in the press, whether or not they were serious candidates, were&#13;
&#13;
all reputed to have declined the post as soon as they had learned&#13;
&#13;
a little about itâ&#128;&#148;this chiefly on the grounds of the kind of&#13;
&#13;
Board the Bank had and the inability of such a Board to work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 26 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There was an informal, one might call it staff praesidium of&#13;
&#13;
Chester McLain, Leonard Rist, Crena de Iongh and myself, that met&#13;
&#13;
every day, several times a day sometimes, on the ordinary&#13;
&#13;
business that was coming along.   It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t so much a case of&#13;
&#13;
advancing the business as it was of making certain that nothing&#13;
&#13;
was neglected that ought to be done as a holding action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What sort of business would this be?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   That would be everything from candidates for posts to&#13;
&#13;
channeling the first loan applications of the Bank to someone to&#13;
&#13;
start looking at them.   This is what I mean by holding action.&#13;
&#13;
There werenâ&#128;&#153;t sufficient policies to direct exactly where a loan&#13;
&#13;
application of that day was going to end or what machinery we&#13;
&#13;
would use for processing it.   At the same time we tried to&#13;
&#13;
prevent it lying on a desk somewhere and not being advanced at&#13;
&#13;
all.   And this praesidium looked at everything, but mostly we had&#13;
&#13;
to contend with the whole political situation insofar as the&#13;
&#13;
presidency and vice-presidency and situation among the directors&#13;
&#13;
was concerned.&#13;
&#13;
       It was interesting from the standpoint of what developed&#13;
&#13;
later that when it became known among some directors that a few&#13;
&#13;
of us on the staff were trying to do a few things, very minor&#13;
&#13;
things if you like, a great discussion began among the directors&#13;
&#13;
as to just what would be the proper liaison between directors and&#13;
&#13;
this informal staff body.   We concluded in our own wisdom that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 27 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
there was no room for an executive director in this holding&#13;
&#13;
organization of ours.   And yet Mr. Collado, the U.S. executive&#13;
&#13;
director, kept on insisting that he must sit with us whenever we&#13;
&#13;
met, and we finally compromised on meeting regularly with him&#13;
&#13;
apart from our own meetings in order just to inform him of such&#13;
&#13;
developments as we thought he ought to know of.    But that will&#13;
&#13;
give you a sample of the flavor of that period, particularly&#13;
&#13;
insofar as Executive Directors were concerned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What sort of things were the Executive Directors themselves&#13;
&#13;
doing?   Were they holding meetings, too?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    They were holding meetings, and they were also in their&#13;
&#13;
way trying to advance things, but we tangled up in procedure just&#13;
&#13;
too often.   The question of who would chair a committee and just&#13;
&#13;
exactly what the terms of reference of such a committee would be:&#13;
&#13;
These were questions where as soon as the Executive Directors&#13;
&#13;
differedâ&#128;&#148;and they usually did--, you werenâ&#128;&#153;t able to make much&#13;
&#13;
headway.    There was no chair to say, â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;ll do it one wayâ&#128;? or&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;ll do it the other.â&#128;?   There was no chair to take a consensus&#13;
&#13;
of views.    It must be remembered up to this point that nowhere&#13;
&#13;
was there any description of the functions of the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors.   It must also be remembered that some of them,&#13;
&#13;
particularly the strong men that Iâ&#128;&#153;m speaking of, were in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank immediately after Savannah, which was in March of this year.&#13;
&#13;
In other words, they were in the Bank first.     They were in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 28 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bank withâ&#128;&#148;I might call itâ&#128;&#148;a better than proprietary attitude.&#13;
&#13;
They were the representatives of their bodies politic and&#13;
&#13;
sovereign.   They had a good deal of reason to believe that they&#13;
&#13;
were going to run the Bank.   Whether this was possible or not is&#13;
&#13;
another question.   But to think of what each man himself had in&#13;
&#13;
mind subjectivelyâ&#128;&#148;thereâ&#128;&#153;s a good deal to support the attitude&#13;
&#13;
that it was their task to try to run the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      Now, similarly, as Iâ&#128;&#153;ve said several times, it was Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s idea that it was his task, and you can see a great deal&#13;
&#13;
of conflict in an era and in an atmosphere where there had been&#13;
&#13;
little experience on either side as to how things were to be done&#13;
&#13;
and hence the repeated collisions and inability of the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
make a great deal of headway in the early days.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Iâ&#128;&#153;m interested in some illustrations of this.   With respect&#13;
&#13;
to loan applications, for example, would a country interested in&#13;
&#13;
getting a loan submit an application to the Executive Directors&#13;
&#13;
or to the management or to both?   Was there any feeling as to&#13;
&#13;
what was proper?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   I donâ&#128;&#153;t recall that there was any particular feeling.&#13;
&#13;
I think in general they came into the presidentâ&#128;&#153;s office.   I&#13;
&#13;
recall the Chilean application, which I think is the first one&#13;
&#13;
received unless Iâ&#128;&#153;m mistaken, coming into the presidentâ&#128;&#153;s office.&#13;
&#13;
But whether or not the application came through the executive&#13;
&#13;
director, a good handful of the Executive Directors considered&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 29 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
themselves the agents for the applicant if the applicant was one&#13;
&#13;
of their constituents.    An executive director would consider it&#13;
&#13;
his duty to follow up on the application to make sure it was not&#13;
&#13;
neglected, to talk to those who were working on it, to advance&#13;
&#13;
the case of the particular project as well as he could      This has&#13;
&#13;
since all disappeared.    Itâ&#128;&#153;s recognized that Executive Directors&#13;
&#13;
do not negotiate loans.    But at that time I think that an&#13;
&#13;
executive director would do everything that he could think of to&#13;
&#13;
advance the particular proposal.   You must remember also that&#13;
&#13;
some of the Executive Directors at that time were given to the&#13;
&#13;
idea of the loan basketâ&#128;&#148;namely, that the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s available&#13;
&#13;
resources were to be divided in certain proportions among certain&#13;
&#13;
areas and that was that.   On that basis it was a case of get in&#13;
&#13;
early and move things as quickly as you could to get your share&#13;
&#13;
of the loan basket.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was it possible that a given executive director might do some&#13;
&#13;
investigation about a prospective loan himself or would he ask&#13;
&#13;
staff to help him work it up. . .?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   I think your second statement was more likely.     I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
think an executive director expected to study an application.     I&#13;
&#13;
think he did expect to be kept fully informed about how a study&#13;
&#13;
was going way beyond the degree to which an executive director&#13;
&#13;
should be so informed and way beyond the degree to which the&#13;
&#13;
executive director would expect to be kept informed if it were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 30 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
not an application from one of his countries.   But he did not&#13;
&#13;
expect to process.   He did expect that the staff would process in&#13;
&#13;
collaboration with himself.   He expected to be asked advice and&#13;
&#13;
to give such advice.   He expected to exercise a little overall&#13;
&#13;
direction perhaps to the staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How about applications for employment?   Were some of these&#13;
&#13;
being funneled through Executive Directors?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Yes, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t think thatâ&#128;&#153;s of any great importance.&#13;
&#13;
The applications from countries to this day will frequently come&#13;
&#13;
through an executive director.    But in this sense I think itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
purely a question of a mailing address, a mailing channel.&#13;
&#13;
Occasionally an executive director might be the channel for the&#13;
&#13;
sending in of an application of a person whom he knows, whom heâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
interested in, and whom heâ&#128;&#153;s prepared to sponsor.   And he may&#13;
&#13;
advance the proposal a bit more one way than just as a mailing&#13;
&#13;
channel.   But this has always happened.   Itâ&#128;&#153;s logical that the&#13;
&#13;
principals behind an executive director in a home country, if&#13;
&#13;
they have candidates that they think are suitable for the staff&#13;
&#13;
to tell the executive director and have the executive director&#13;
&#13;
channel it in the Bank as being more familiar with the channels&#13;
&#13;
through which it ought to go.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How about relations with the New York investment market?    Did&#13;
&#13;
any Executive Directors attempt themselves to deal with some of&#13;
&#13;
the bankers in New York?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   I donâ&#128;&#153;t think so or at least I donâ&#128;&#153;t know of any cases&#13;
&#13;
where they might have.   I would suspect that the U.S. executive&#13;
&#13;
director, possibly the U.K. director, might have had very general&#13;
&#13;
preliminary conversations in New York, particularly during the&#13;
&#13;
interregnum, as we called it.    But even if they did, Iâ&#128;&#153;m quite&#13;
&#13;
sure they were reasonably inconclusive.    I can recall vaguely an&#13;
&#13;
occasion or two when the U.S. executive director told a board&#13;
&#13;
meeting that he had been in New York, that he had had talks about&#13;
&#13;
possible quotations of Bank securities at some early date.    But&#13;
&#13;
my recollection is that his report was in very general terms.&#13;
&#13;
The discussions he had were almost entirely inconclusive.    It was&#13;
&#13;
well known that the Bank expected to sell its securities before&#13;
&#13;
long.   It was better known even that the Bank would be dependent&#13;
&#13;
to a large extent on borrowed money.     It was not the exercise of&#13;
&#13;
any great initiative.    If anyone in any position of&#13;
&#13;
responsibility at that time was in New York and talked to&#13;
&#13;
underwriters about the kind of conditions that might affect the&#13;
&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s first issue, even the fact that the Bank did make its&#13;
&#13;
first issues in July of â&#128;&#153;47, meant that some months before that&#13;
&#13;
there must have been shadows cast, even though they were not&#13;
&#13;
conclusive or even directly relevant.    I mentioned, I think,&#13;
&#13;
earlier that Mr. Meyer himself had the idea of organizing a large&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 32 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
advisory committee of perhaps 50 or 60 well-known financiers to&#13;
&#13;
advise the World Bank on its financing policies.&#13;
&#13;
      Well, this was a reasonably nebulous affair.    He had been&#13;
&#13;
up to New York.   He had talked with several leading financial&#13;
&#13;
people, and I think I recall his reporting to the board on one&#13;
&#13;
occasion that heâ&#128;&#153;d had a meeting with some in New York and that&#13;
&#13;
they had agreed to serve as advisers to the Bank in issuing bonds&#13;
&#13;
or other securities and so on.   But nothing ever came of it, and&#13;
&#13;
so far as I know, apart from the informal talking which Mr. Meyer&#13;
&#13;
did up there, there were no meetings coming to formal decisions&#13;
&#13;
or even giving formal advice of a group of this kind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   There was a press story in October or November of 1946 about&#13;
&#13;
a speech given, I believe, in Canada by the Dutch executive&#13;
&#13;
director in which he said that the Bank was about to make its&#13;
&#13;
first bond issue, and he even said something about the terms and&#13;
&#13;
conditions.   Apparently, according to the press release, he had&#13;
&#13;
no sooner given the speech than the management of the Bank said&#13;
&#13;
that many of the things he said were in error.   Do you recall&#13;
&#13;
anything about this particular occasion?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Well, I recall the fact that there was an incident with&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Beyen coming out of this speech in Quebec City.    Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure&#13;
&#13;
that I remember all that the speech was about, but I think the&#13;
&#13;
issue was taken not only with regard to the statements made by&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Beyen regarding a bond issue (I donâ&#128;&#153;t recall those, as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 33 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
matter of fact), but there were various statements made by Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Beyen which might better have come from the president of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, whoever he was, because they were ideas being considered by&#13;
&#13;
management at the time, but they were not ideas that had been&#13;
&#13;
approved yet; and Beyenâ&#128;&#153;s statements were the equivalent of a&#13;
&#13;
premature disclosure of what was going on.   Beyen, of course,&#13;
&#13;
felt that he had a perfect right to talk that way.    Management&#13;
&#13;
felt that it was not up to an executive director to make such&#13;
&#13;
disclosures.   My memory is vague on the actual subject, but if&#13;
&#13;
one read the speech of Mr. Beyen, one would quickly recall&#13;
&#13;
exactly what points the management was displeased about.    But&#13;
&#13;
this was a good reflection of the atmosphere at the time and the&#13;
&#13;
lack of a line of demarcation between the jurisdiction of the&#13;
&#13;
executive director and jurisdiction of the management.    And I&#13;
&#13;
might interject here that the Articles of Agreement, of course,&#13;
&#13;
were not very helpful.   The Articles of Agreement, as you know,&#13;
&#13;
give the Executive Directors a vague general overriding&#13;
&#13;
jurisdiction but certainly leave the day-to-day operations of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank and the hiring and firing of staff, for example, and so on&#13;
&#13;
to the president, which means the management.&#13;
&#13;
     About all I can say is what I said earlier about the&#13;
&#13;
attitudes, the necessary attitudes, with which the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors came to office and the way in which they came to office&#13;
&#13;
before any staff, before any management, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
     We must also add to what I said earlier.   The Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors who first came to the Bank were imbued with the whole&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 34 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
spirit of Bretton Woods and Savannah, meetings which were held by&#13;
&#13;
their principals and to a large extent by themselves.   Beyen was&#13;
&#13;
at Bretton Woods, Collado was at Bretton Woods; a great many of&#13;
&#13;
the figures who played a part in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s development were&#13;
&#13;
figures that had been in at the beginning long before the&#13;
&#13;
subsequent successful managements at the Bank.   And you must&#13;
&#13;
remember that when personalities of this kind, imbued with the&#13;
&#13;
fact that they had created the institution and their principals&#13;
&#13;
had, they feel that it is their place to make a success; it was&#13;
&#13;
their conclusion that the world needed a world bank.    To say to&#13;
&#13;
people like that suddenly out of the blue:   â&#128;&#156;We give you a fresh&#13;
&#13;
new management and it will run things and you will behave,&#13;
&#13;
please,â&#128;? is saying a great deal.    That would take some very stern&#13;
&#13;
measures to effectuate it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:    I have heard that the British executive director had been a&#13;
&#13;
candidate, so to speak, of the vice-presidency of the Bank, and&#13;
&#13;
that the board was somewhat surprised when Mr. Meyer announced&#13;
&#13;
that he had appointed a vice-president.   Do you know anything&#13;
&#13;
about this story?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   No, I donâ&#128;&#153;t.   This was before my time, just a bit&#13;
&#13;
before, if itâ&#128;&#153;s the appointment of Harold Smith youâ&#128;&#153;re speaking&#13;
&#13;
of.   Harold Smith had just been appointed when I arrived.   But&#13;
&#13;
Sir James Grigg made it clear that he was available later when&#13;
&#13;
the vacancy developed at the top.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 35 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I wonder if we could talk about how these various issues were&#13;
&#13;
finally resolved specifically with the election of Mr. McCloy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Well, it is true that in the interregnumâ&#128;&#148;and that is&#13;
&#13;
why it was called an interregnumâ&#128;&#148;whether it was the unfavorable&#13;
&#13;
press or whether it was the sheer effect of the nature of this&#13;
&#13;
board:   after all, no one knew whether the press mightnâ&#128;&#153;t be&#13;
&#13;
right; that is, the unfavorable press mightnâ&#128;&#153;t be right in the&#13;
&#13;
sense that an organization of this character might not be able to&#13;
&#13;
succeed.&#13;
&#13;
      But whether it was because of the unfavorable press or&#13;
&#13;
whether it was because of talks with Mr. Meyer or understandings&#13;
&#13;
of what had gone on in the Bank up to that point, it is perfectly&#13;
&#13;
true that the first candidates sought by the U.S. to be nominated&#13;
&#13;
for the presidency turned it down.      They were all, so far as I&#13;
&#13;
know, persons with many preoccupations.     It was obviously not&#13;
&#13;
going to be a question of remuneration, for example.     But the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. was seeking people whose personalities would fit into this&#13;
&#13;
high position and also whose personalities would serve to provide&#13;
&#13;
chairmanship.   By that time there was a general feeling that Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Meyer, right or wrong about the things he thought, was not the&#13;
&#13;
strongest possible chairman.   However, the first candidates were&#13;
&#13;
negative in their reactions, and finally Mr. McCloy was&#13;
&#13;
mentioned.   He had been an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. government during the war.   He was a lawyer with the&#13;
&#13;
Millbank firm in New York, which had, I believe, among its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 36 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
clients the Chase Bank, and therefore some of Mr. McCloyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
connections were in the banking field.    In particular, one&#13;
&#13;
connection was Mr. Black, who later appeared on the scene in&#13;
&#13;
different capacity.    At that time he was a vice-president of&#13;
&#13;
Chase, and he and McCloy knew each other pretty well.&#13;
&#13;
     Well, Mr. McCloy, I think, looked into the possibilities of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank presidency more thoroughly than any previous candidate.&#13;
&#13;
In the first place, he knew the general counsel of the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
Mr. McLain, and they had long conversations.    Mr. McCloy also was&#13;
&#13;
acquainted with Mr. Demuth from their connection in the War&#13;
&#13;
Department and I think had talks with him.    He and Mr. Meyer had&#13;
&#13;
talks with him.   They also had talks with Executive Directors,&#13;
&#13;
people in the U.S. government, and people in the financial&#13;
&#13;
markets of New York.&#13;
&#13;
     As a result of all these talks, it seems clear, because I&#13;
&#13;
think up to that time I had not met Mr. McCloy, that he was&#13;
&#13;
satisfied that the operations of the Executive Directors, so far&#13;
&#13;
as that operation could be ascertained and described, that&#13;
&#13;
operation needed a great deal of, shall I say, amendment or&#13;
&#13;
revision.   I hesitate to call it a defined procedure.   In their&#13;
&#13;
six months the directors had been feeling their way, even if&#13;
&#13;
rather chaotically.    In any case, it became clear to Mr. McCloy&#13;
&#13;
that if a procedure of the Executive Directors could be improved&#13;
&#13;
sufficiently, the World Bank could be successful, could do the&#13;
&#13;
job that it was designed to do, and could realize the objectives&#13;
&#13;
that were set for it in the articles, and fulfill the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 37 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
expectations that had been foreseen at Bretton Woods and so&#13;
&#13;
forth.&#13;
&#13;
     I think that having reached this conclusionâ&#128;&#148;and some of his&#13;
&#13;
intimates will know more about this than I do--, he then felt in&#13;
&#13;
his forthright manner that it was important that the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors agree with what he had in mind.   Otherwise he was&#13;
&#13;
certainly not prepared to take on the post.&#13;
&#13;
     There followed, I think, two sessionsâ&#128;&#148;perhaps moreâ&#128;&#148;that Mr.&#13;
&#13;
McCloy had with the Executive Directors by themselves.    There&#13;
&#13;
were just the directors and Mr. McCloy, so far as I know.     And at&#13;
&#13;
these meetings the respective terms of reference, the respective&#13;
&#13;
jurisdictions of Executive Directors and the management, were&#13;
&#13;
discussed.   No written agreement came out of these meetings.     No&#13;
&#13;
reports, oral or otherwise, were made by people who were present.&#13;
&#13;
But Mr. McCloy accepted the post of the presidency, and it was&#13;
&#13;
apparent from the moment that he took office on March 17, â&#128;&#153;47&#13;
&#13;
that the chairman was the directing genius of the Bank acceptably&#13;
&#13;
to the Executive Directors.   It was also apparent that Mr. McCloy&#13;
&#13;
was going to be a very strong chairman and that there would be no&#13;
&#13;
room for little rivalries, the exercise of rival ambitions and so&#13;
&#13;
forth, among the Executive Directors.   It soon became clear from&#13;
&#13;
the fact that it was understood, for example, that all&#13;
&#13;
recommendations to the board were going to come from the chairâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
this type of procedure.   It was very clear from procedural&#13;
&#13;
innovations that both on procedure and on substance the&#13;
&#13;
initiative was going to be in the chair from then on.    And this,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 38 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I must say, apparently had been agreed to between the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors and Mr. McCloy, because that was the way in which the&#13;
&#13;
Bank operated from March 17, â&#128;&#153;47 on.&#13;
&#13;
        I should also say that when Mr. McCloy came on March 17, he&#13;
&#13;
had brought with him Mr. Garner and informed the executive&#13;
&#13;
director that Mr. Garner was to be vice-president of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
In actual fact, Mr. Garner became vice-president and a sort of&#13;
&#13;
day-to-day general manager of the Bank.    And with that period,&#13;
&#13;
which began in the middle of March â&#128;&#153;47, the Bank began to make&#13;
&#13;
great strides, both on the lending side and on the borrowing&#13;
&#13;
side.    The first loan was given to France in May of â&#128;&#153;47.   The&#13;
&#13;
first bond issues were made in July of â&#128;&#153;47.    Mr. McCloy did a&#13;
&#13;
Trojan job in taking the stump from coast to coast.    Many of the&#13;
&#13;
staff of the Bank did the sameâ&#128;&#148;to broaden the knowledge about the&#13;
&#13;
Bank everywhere, particularly to investment circles, bankersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
&#13;
associations and so forth.    And while everybody contributed to&#13;
&#13;
this task, I think McCloyâ&#128;&#153;s own achievements were the greatest.&#13;
&#13;
He was well and favorably known in the New York market, which&#13;
&#13;
also helped and which permitted him to get good advice on how the&#13;
&#13;
Bank should do its financing.&#13;
&#13;
        I think that the change, the rather drastic change, in&#13;
&#13;
operation between the period prior to March 17, the rather&#13;
&#13;
aimless procedure, the rather aimless progress of the Bank, if it&#13;
&#13;
can be called progress, which preceded the McCloy era, and the&#13;
&#13;
forthright, go-ahead progress which came with that era, made a&#13;
&#13;
startling contrast.    But Mr. McCloy undoubtedly intended to run&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 39 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, and did and insofar as I can say, as a result of the&#13;
&#13;
meetings I mentioned, with the acquiescence of the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Does this suggest, among other things, that the board met&#13;
&#13;
only at the call of the president?      I take it before it had been&#13;
&#13;
meeting more or less on its own initiative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Yes.   I should mention that we went through a period,&#13;
&#13;
following Mr. Smithâ&#128;&#153;s death, because Mr. Smith used to sit as&#13;
&#13;
chairman at meetings which took place, when the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors would name chairmen.   There was a great deal of&#13;
&#13;
discussion, a great deal of vying, as to whether if the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
director were in the chair of a particular committee he shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
continue right through, or whether they would rotate and so&#13;
&#13;
forth.   There was also a great deal of discussion, rather unhappy&#13;
&#13;
discussion, as to whether an executive director could be&#13;
&#13;
president.    The general counsel took a strong position negatively&#13;
&#13;
about that.   But all of that disappeared with the coming of the&#13;
&#13;
McCloy management.   I think it might be said that the board met&#13;
&#13;
only at the call of the management.     But procedures began being&#13;
&#13;
discussed in a much more straightforward way, as is evidenced&#13;
&#13;
from the papers that youâ&#128;&#153;ve seen that came out at the beginning&#13;
&#13;
of the McCloy era, and the papers were very forthright as to&#13;
&#13;
meetings, as to Executive Directorsâ&#128;&#153; position as regard to loan&#13;
&#13;
procedures, loan policies.   But these papers also set forth the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 40 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
obligations of the management toward the Executive Directors with&#13;
&#13;
regard to lending procedures, lending policies and so forth.     To&#13;
&#13;
this day the Bank will not invite negotiators to come to&#13;
&#13;
Washington on loans, for example, without first informing the&#13;
&#13;
board.   The board gets regular periodic reports on the progress&#13;
&#13;
of the bankâ&#128;&#153;s pipeline.    In many ways the Board is better&#13;
&#13;
informed than it has ever been, and all this began in the McCloy&#13;
&#13;
era.&#13;
&#13;
       However, the McCloy era, which was a bit over two years, in&#13;
&#13;
some instances merely threw down guidelines, and it took longer&#13;
&#13;
to evolve to our present procedures.    But mostly the guidelines&#13;
&#13;
followed by the Bank today were thought about and were laid down&#13;
&#13;
during that period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there any feeling on the part of management that youâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
&#13;
aware of that it was necessary to have full-time Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors in Washington?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Itâ&#128;&#153;s too easy for a strong management to consider a&#13;
&#13;
board unnecessary at all.   After all, from the standpoint of&#13;
&#13;
getting things done, thereâ&#128;&#153;s nothing a board does that management&#13;
&#13;
canâ&#128;&#153;t do better faster and more efficiently, especially when you&#13;
&#13;
stop to think that in the Bank we began to follow the procedure&#13;
&#13;
of all initiative coming from the chair.   But thatâ&#128;&#153;s a futile&#13;
&#13;
line of thought because no board, no bank.   I used to remind Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Garner that the same articles of agreement which did not create&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 41 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
his position did create the board.     I think that for those who&#13;
&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t like boardsâ&#128;&#148;and there are many, because boards are a&#13;
&#13;
slowing factor; thereâ&#128;&#153;s no question about itâ&#128;&#148;this particularly&#13;
&#13;
ponderous board would be an undesirable feature.    But you cannot&#13;
&#13;
get away from the fact that this Bank, which is also an&#13;
&#13;
international organization, some representation of membership,&#13;
&#13;
some representation of ownership, is required.    Bodies politic&#13;
&#13;
look upon international organizations rather differently than a&#13;
&#13;
shareholder looks upon a corporation.    A shareholder is quite&#13;
&#13;
willing to leave the stewardship of a corporation to the able&#13;
&#13;
people that all the shareholders have chosen to be on the board&#13;
&#13;
of directors.   But a body politic doesnâ&#128;&#153;t work that way.    Its&#13;
&#13;
agents are out at the end of strings, and theyâ&#128;&#153;re interested, and&#13;
&#13;
part of the result of this means a certain cumbersomeness in the&#13;
&#13;
operation, which may be kept to a minimum but nevertheless itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
there.   Well, now, if you take an actionable, go-ahead,&#13;
&#13;
progressive management that never had any experience with boards&#13;
&#13;
of this kind, obviously the clumsy nature of the board is going&#13;
&#13;
to be over-apparent.   And thereâ&#128;&#153;s no doubt at all that Mr. McCloy&#13;
&#13;
thought that the board was rather too much in evidence, a view&#13;
&#13;
which had a great deal of sympathy in many of our minds on the&#13;
&#13;
staff side.   And certainly the earlier period of the Bank had&#13;
&#13;
made clear that a board of this nature, given the opportunity at&#13;
&#13;
all, would keep itself in evidence.&#13;
&#13;
     These were all high-level men who had held important posts.&#13;
&#13;
They had held policy posts in governmentâ&#128;&#148;frequently at Cabinet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 42 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
level.   You couldnâ&#128;&#153;t take people like that and suddenly make&#13;
&#13;
clerks out of them no matter how desirable that might be for the&#13;
&#13;
organization.   And so it was necessary to reach the various&#13;
&#13;
compromises which were reached in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     It is true that in 1948, I think it was, at the governorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
&#13;
meeting, the United States delegation made a motion that a study&#13;
&#13;
be made of the duties and remuneration of Executive Directors.     I&#13;
&#13;
have never been able to discover myself what the real source of&#13;
&#13;
that motion was.   It was moved by the U.S. delegation.   There&#13;
&#13;
have been suspicions that the idea came from inside the Bankâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
either Mr. McCloy or Mr. McLain or both.   But in any case, the&#13;
&#13;
study was made, and one of the conclusions reached was that an&#13;
&#13;
executive director and an alternate both made the board a bit&#13;
&#13;
top-heavy, and that the service of these two men should be&#13;
&#13;
mutually exclusive, except under certain circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
     This report was finally approved in 1950, and there&#13;
&#13;
followed a period in which the board of the Bank shrank a little&#13;
&#13;
in terms of the amount of time people devoted to board work.      The&#13;
&#13;
number of people did not go down much.   Since then, of course,&#13;
&#13;
with the creation of an IFC and the further creation of an IDA,&#13;
&#13;
and with an increasing amount of travel on the part of directors,&#13;
&#13;
the need for the alternates or the need for two instead of one,&#13;
&#13;
you might say, has increased somewhat; and the general feeling&#13;
&#13;
today is rather different from the feeling that prevailed in the&#13;
&#13;
early years of the Bank when one man did not have enough to do at&#13;
&#13;
the board table, let alone two.   Today I think a director and his&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 43 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
alternateâ&#128;&#148;on the average, because these men all work in different&#13;
&#13;
waysâ&#128;&#148;are keeping fairly busy.    Iâ&#128;&#153;ll not go into whether itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
usefully busy or not, but theyâ&#128;&#153;re keeping busy according to their&#13;
&#13;
own lights, and I donâ&#128;&#153;t think we can tell each executive director&#13;
&#13;
how he maintains his relations with his countries.      In some cases&#13;
&#13;
they do it with a great deal of paperwork; in other cases they do&#13;
&#13;
it by telephone if itâ&#128;&#153;s close enough; in some other cases they&#13;
&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t do it at all.   So all this varies.     But in the frequent&#13;
&#13;
consultations that go on between the staff and directors we had&#13;
&#13;
found it useful with the growing volume of activity around the&#13;
&#13;
Bank and its affiliates to have one of the other or both of the&#13;
&#13;
directors available instantaneously.&#13;
&#13;
     Let me just add one footnote.       At this time, taking into&#13;
&#13;
account whatever contributions were made in the first six or nine&#13;
&#13;
months of the Bank, in Mr. Meyerâ&#128;&#153;s period and the interregnum,&#13;
&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#153;s no question that the whole chequered and difficult&#13;
&#13;
history nevertheless helped to bring about the compromise way of&#13;
&#13;
working, which has been found to be a very successful way of&#13;
&#13;
working.   Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no doubt in my mind that the strong&#13;
&#13;
chairmanship which Mr. McCloy brought to the Bank and the general&#13;
&#13;
managership which Mr. Garner brought were necessary, were&#13;
&#13;
necessary as a historical incident.      Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure what would have&#13;
&#13;
transpired if Mr. McCloy had not left at the beginning of July,&#13;
&#13;
1949, if the same strong type of chairmanship had persisted much&#13;
&#13;
longer because we were entering a period where some resentment&#13;
&#13;
was growing, to my mind, among the directors, who felt that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 44 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
perhaps they were needless but it was not necessary to make quite&#13;
&#13;
so clear that they could be needless.    All this changed a bit in&#13;
&#13;
the other direction with the advent of Mr. Blackâ&#128;&#148;not procedurally&#13;
&#13;
so much as personality-wise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you mean to imply by that that Mr. Black went a little bit&#13;
&#13;
farther out of his way than Mr. McCloy?    (interruption)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    Having mentioned Mr. Black, I might just say a word&#13;
&#13;
about the new management and its behavior in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s board&#13;
&#13;
room.    Iâ&#128;&#153;ve already said that Mr. McCloy and Mr. Garner together&#13;
&#13;
brought strong, forthright directoral management to the board&#13;
&#13;
room.    Mr. McCloy was so completely wrapped up in the work of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, in which he was acquitting himself extremely well, that he&#13;
&#13;
might have been guilty of letting the board go by default once or&#13;
&#13;
twice.    Certainly board members felt that they were not in on&#13;
&#13;
things sufficiently.    But in the case of Mr. McCloy it was quite&#13;
&#13;
obvious that he was very busy advancing the work of the Bank, and&#13;
&#13;
if it was impossible because of the pace of things to keep the&#13;
&#13;
board fully informed, the reason was nevertheless a good,&#13;
&#13;
justifiable reason.&#13;
&#13;
        However, after two years a bit over two years, of this kind&#13;
&#13;
of management, the board could certainly be said to be becoming&#13;
&#13;
restive.    This was aggravated a little bit by the fact that&#13;
&#13;
whenever Mr. Garner was in the chair as deputy chairman, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Garner soon made clear that he was the general manager of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 45 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#148;perhaps he made it over clear.     Also, Mr. Garnerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
experience, unlike Mr. McCloyâ&#128;&#153;s, I believe, did not include&#13;
&#13;
experience in the international atmosphere of the kind that would&#13;
&#13;
facilitate operating a board of the kind the Bank had.       If&#13;
&#13;
questions around the board table or discussion around the board&#13;
&#13;
table indicated possible doubts as to a recommendation or a loan&#13;
&#13;
or whatever the item may have been before the board, Mr. Garner&#13;
&#13;
would be likely to bristle.   Objections or comments made on the&#13;
&#13;
substance or policy of the questions before the board would make&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Garner impatient.    He certainly left the impression that in&#13;
&#13;
his mind the most efficient way for the board to operate was to&#13;
&#13;
agree to everything and thereby abbreviate meetings to the&#13;
&#13;
minimum time required.   And needless to say, not all board&#13;
&#13;
members behaved in this satisfactory manner.    And the net result&#13;
&#13;
was that while recommendations were approved, there was, so far&#13;
&#13;
as Mr. McCloy was concerned, an increasing restiveness; and so&#13;
&#13;
far as Mr. Garner was concerned, an additional factor on top of&#13;
&#13;
the rest of this that more and more board members were beginning&#13;
&#13;
to think. . .   The feeling that they were neither needed nor used&#13;
&#13;
was the feeling that in the long run would have produced some&#13;
&#13;
undesirable results.    The board continued to be made up of men&#13;
&#13;
who had held high positions, who considered that their countries&#13;
&#13;
owned the Bank; if they were representatives of creditor&#13;
&#13;
countries, they felt they had a stake in the Bank; if they were&#13;
&#13;
the representatives of borrowing countries, they felt that the&#13;
&#13;
Bank existed for the purpose of lending money to their countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 46 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and of financing development.    For people like this it was&#13;
&#13;
difficult to run a board meeting that would merely say â&#128;&#156;yes, yes,&#13;
&#13;
yesâ&#128;? to every item and then go home.&#13;
&#13;
      Also, the nature of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business was sufficiently&#13;
&#13;
complex so that it would be unusual for an item to be passed with&#13;
&#13;
approval and not have some commentary, not have some question&#13;
&#13;
regarding the borrower or the project or some other item.&#13;
&#13;
      However, Mr. McCloy left at the beginning of July, â&#128;&#153;49, and&#13;
&#13;
was succeeded by Mr. Black, who had up till then been the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
executive director.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there any thought at that time that Mr. Garner might&#13;
&#13;
become president to succeed Mr. McCloy?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   I believe that Mr. Garner at first would have&#13;
&#13;
considered that logical, but I also believe that he learned quite&#13;
&#13;
early that it was intended to do otherwise.   I think Mr. McCloy&#13;
&#13;
himself in the recommendations that he made, while he may have&#13;
&#13;
included Mr. Garner, did not include Mr. Garner in a sufficiently&#13;
&#13;
high priority to have made it possible.   I think in the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
government, while politics play a part and I canâ&#128;&#153;t estimate that&#13;
&#13;
part, I donâ&#128;&#153;t think Mr. Garner had endeared himself to those in&#13;
&#13;
the U.S. government who have something to say about the choice of&#13;
&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s president.   But in any case it became clear quite&#13;
&#13;
early when it was known that Mr. McCloy was leaving that Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Garner was not slated to succeed.    In fact, as I understand it,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 47 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mr. McCloy was asked for a slate of names that he considered&#13;
&#13;
suitable for the post, and people in the U.S. government, the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. Treasury especially, were busily preparing slates, too.     Mr.&#13;
&#13;
McCloyâ&#128;&#153;s slate leaned towards the New York market.   The U.S.&#13;
&#13;
government slate leaned towards government.   And, as I understand&#13;
&#13;
it, Mr. Black was chosen as a compromiseâ&#128;&#148;one of the few that was&#13;
&#13;
on both lists, or having been on one, was willingly included in&#13;
&#13;
the other.   I think each list had prior names to Mr. Black, but&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Black turned out to be an acceptable compromise candidate.&#13;
&#13;
And with Mr. Blackâ&#128;&#153;s coming, while the procedures of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t alter, and while Mr. Blackâ&#128;&#153;s convictions so far as Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
&#13;
concerned differed very little from Mr. McCloyâ&#128;&#153;s, his method of&#13;
&#13;
carrying out the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s work, in particularly the conduct of&#13;
&#13;
board meetings, underwent an immediate change for what one might&#13;
&#13;
consider the better, and this due chiefly to personality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you illustrate this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Well, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll illustrate it by a current funny remark that&#13;
&#13;
used to go around.   Mr. Blackâ&#128;&#153;s personality was the kind of&#13;
&#13;
personality (and board members would agree with this, by the way)&#13;
&#13;
where if you had to request something from him and he turned you&#13;
&#13;
down, you left with the impression that here was an extremely&#13;
&#13;
fine fellow.   Whereas there were othersâ&#128;&#148;and I shanâ&#128;&#153;t mention any&#13;
&#13;
names hereâ&#128;&#148;to whom if you went with a request and he said â&#128;&#156;yes,â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
youâ&#128;&#153;d go away thinking that he was a dirty dog.   That was current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 48 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
at the time, and I think is a crude way of describing the&#13;
&#13;
difference of personalities.   Mr. Black took the time, though he&#13;
&#13;
was as busy as his predecessor had been, to cultivate the board,&#13;
&#13;
first of allâ&#128;&#148;socially to some extentâ&#128;&#148;and during the work day and&#13;
&#13;
the work week.   At board meetings, without allowing the board any&#13;
&#13;
greater jurisdiction than they had been allowed previously, he&#13;
&#13;
was nevertheless able to convey the feeling in the board room&#13;
&#13;
that the primary jurisdiction was the boardâ&#128;&#153;s.   Strangely, this&#13;
&#13;
made it all the easier to obtain the boardâ&#128;&#153;s approval, with fewer&#13;
&#13;
questions and less discussion, while seeming to encourage them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you know of any occasions between 1949 and the present&#13;
&#13;
where the board has rejected any management recommendation?     Or&#13;
&#13;
even been on the verge?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Well, thatâ&#128;&#153;s a difficult question to answer, and I&#13;
&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t believe that any categorical answer will do.   You must&#13;
&#13;
remember that with our system of weighted voting, with our system&#13;
&#13;
of having board members accessible all the time, and therefore&#13;
&#13;
immediate consultation is always possible, with the closeness&#13;
&#13;
that develops between staff and board, particularly my office and&#13;
&#13;
the presidentâ&#128;&#153;s office, if any proposal made by management was&#13;
&#13;
likely to be rejected, this would be known long before that&#13;
&#13;
proposal was in a final enough stage to go onto the board table;&#13;
&#13;
and it could be delayed, abandoned, deferred and what-not and&#13;
&#13;
nothing much said.   It would be pretty hard under our system of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 49 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
working, though not impossible, to come into the board room with&#13;
&#13;
something that was going to be thrown out by the board and not&#13;
&#13;
know it, and if you knew it, are you likely to be there?     We&#13;
&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t vote in board meetings except rarely, and even then a vote&#13;
&#13;
might be one dissent against something, and thatâ&#128;&#153;s the vote.&#13;
&#13;
While I carry written ballots into every meeting with me, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
yet to use them.   I have used tally sheets once in a while.       But&#13;
&#13;
we donâ&#128;&#153;t vote, and itâ&#128;&#153;s an excellent thing that we donâ&#128;&#153;t vote,&#13;
&#13;
although this is another subject, because voting in our&#13;
&#13;
atmosphere is a question among board members of whoâ&#128;&#153;s your friend&#13;
&#13;
and whoâ&#128;&#153;s not.   We donâ&#128;&#153;t care for that, and the Bank has no&#13;
&#13;
business on that side of politics.      But yet this is what you&#13;
&#13;
stimulate the minute you take votes.     So we donâ&#128;&#153;t vote.   But we&#13;
&#13;
do know where weâ&#128;&#153;re heading.   And you must remember that the&#13;
&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s work doesnâ&#128;&#153;t consist of something considered on Tuesday&#13;
&#13;
night which is going to be on the Board table Wednesday morning.&#13;
&#13;
It takes months and months to reach the board table for board&#13;
&#13;
decision.   So I think the best answer to the question is that if&#13;
&#13;
there were such a thing as a proposal initiated by the chair that&#13;
&#13;
the board were going to vote down, that proposal wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t appear&#13;
&#13;
on the board table.   But we still cannot say that anything has&#13;
&#13;
been voted down.   And perhaps the Polish loan, about which youâ&#128;&#153;ll&#13;
&#13;
hear from different people, falls into that category in the&#13;
&#13;
boldest relief, because the Polish loan was something where there&#13;
&#13;
was a great division of opinion pro and con, ending I think with&#13;
&#13;
no decision in the board room, although it was as close as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 50 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
anything could be to the board table.   But the consensus around&#13;
&#13;
and in the corridors suggested, especially since the Marshall&#13;
&#13;
Plan was just being voted in the United States at that time, that&#13;
&#13;
it would be inadvisable to produce this proposal on the table at&#13;
&#13;
that particular moment.&#13;
&#13;
     Let us suppose for a second that there was a proposition&#13;
&#13;
which did get onto the board table, and the board showed it&#13;
&#13;
wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have it, the simplest technique in the world would be&#13;
&#13;
for the chairman to say to the board (and I for one would&#13;
&#13;
encourage it):   â&#128;&#156;Well, weâ&#128;&#153;ll take another look at it and tell you&#13;
&#13;
about it again at another meeting.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
(pause in recording)&#13;
&#13;
     We have been discussing, I think, the period when Mr. Black&#13;
&#13;
succeeded Mr. McCloy, and in particular the effects of the change&#13;
&#13;
in the relations and workings of the Executive Directors within&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.   I have already stated my belief that while Mr. Black&#13;
&#13;
followed pretty much the same practices and had about the same&#13;
&#13;
ideas of Mr. McCloy regarding conduct of meetings and the&#13;
&#13;
handling of relations with the Executive Directors, nevertheless,&#13;
&#13;
in my opinion, Mr. Blackâ&#128;&#153;s personality went a great distance in&#13;
&#13;
giving the Bank a working relationship between management and&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors which represented a great improvement, if one&#13;
&#13;
might call it that, over the McCloy era.   By this I mean that&#13;
&#13;
while the success of the Bank in its operations would, I think,&#13;
&#13;
have been exactly the same, the working relationship within the&#13;
&#13;
Bank between members of management and members of the board was a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 51 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
happier, more cordial and more flexible one.   If Mr. McCloy had&#13;
&#13;
continued, I think the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s achievements probably would have&#13;
&#13;
been commensurate with those that came under Mr. Black.   However,&#13;
&#13;
the atmosphere within the Bank was less compartmented, less&#13;
&#13;
formal, and this has been, I think correctly, ascribed to Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Blackâ&#128;&#153;s rather unique personality.&#13;
&#13;
     It might be useful at this juncture to say a word about the&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors themselves.   They represent an extremely&#13;
&#13;
curious instrument.   In the first place, the body of Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors, which we called the board informally, although the&#13;
&#13;
Bank has really only one board and thatâ&#128;&#153;s the Board of Governors,&#13;
&#13;
are first of all different from any counterpart body in national&#13;
&#13;
organizations.   In the second place, theyâ&#128;&#153;re in the Bank more or&#13;
&#13;
less all the timeâ&#128;&#148;a rather unique organism: that is to say, a&#13;
&#13;
policy board available full time.    Itâ&#128;&#153;s difficult to see what&#13;
&#13;
would occupy a policy board full time.&#13;
&#13;
     The next important characteristic is the differences in&#13;
&#13;
personality, character, background, history and occupation of the&#13;
&#13;
members of the board.   Thereâ&#128;&#153;s very little in the way of common&#13;
&#13;
denominator among the Executive Directors of the Bank on any one&#13;
&#13;
of its boards.   They comprehend people with a great deal of&#13;
&#13;
influence at home and some perhaps with less influence.   They&#13;
&#13;
comprehend people whom we might describe as extremely competent&#13;
&#13;
and some whom we might describe perhaps otherwise.   There are&#13;
&#13;
language difficulties, because the Bank has been using Englishâ&#128;&#148;I&#13;
&#13;
always say any kind of English with any kind of accentâ&#128;&#148;and for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 52 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
some this affects not only articulation but the thinking&#13;
&#13;
processes.   More than once there has been a semi-ludicrous&#13;
&#13;
occurrence at a board meeting because an executive director will&#13;
&#13;
make a reference which shows clearly he is misunderstanding the&#13;
&#13;
use of the English language.   The 18 Executive Directors come&#13;
&#13;
from 18 different countries.   Behind most of them stand&#13;
&#13;
alternates who come from an additional 10 or 12 countries.&#13;
&#13;
Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a matter of 30 or so different races, with highly&#13;
&#13;
developed but different backgrounds.    This will serve to give you&#13;
&#13;
some concept of the complex nature of the Executive Directors as&#13;
&#13;
such, something which isnâ&#128;&#153;t always apparent because these men&#13;
&#13;
behave with a diplomatic dignity, with a certain amount of&#13;
&#13;
formality of procedure and so on, which, while not overly&#13;
&#13;
bureaucratic or overly parliamentary, nevertheless could serve to&#13;
&#13;
hide a great deal of the real character of the board, which I&#13;
&#13;
have been describing.&#13;
&#13;
     With a group of this kindâ&#128;&#148;and this is why I stressed the&#13;
&#13;
question of Mr. Blackâ&#128;&#153;s personalityâ&#128;&#148;it is not easy to get&#13;
&#13;
unanimity in decisions and work as varied as that of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
In this respect, one might call Mr. Black a drop of oil on what&#13;
&#13;
might be naturally troubled waters in whatever the Bank had to do&#13;
&#13;
inside its board room.   However, we now have the picture of this&#13;
&#13;
type of board, inaugurated by Mr. McCloy and continued by Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Black, a very strong management.   I think, as a matter of fact,&#13;
&#13;
that one of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s contributions to the whole&#13;
&#13;
international field will be the fact that it has a strong&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 53 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
management which has been allowed to be strong because of its&#13;
&#13;
achievements by the bodies that are members of the Bank and own&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.    The representatives of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s members, the day-to-&#13;
&#13;
day Executive Directors and the loftier Board of Governors, have&#13;
&#13;
(and the powers behind them have) been willing to allow the&#13;
&#13;
strong management of the Bank to have its way to a large extent.&#13;
&#13;
In my personal opinion, this is partly due to the fact that the&#13;
&#13;
Bank has been a successful institution.     Any lack of success in&#13;
&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s achievements would have placed heavier&#13;
&#13;
responsibilities for such lack of success on the Board, and our&#13;
&#13;
course of history might easily have been different.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Has there ever been a time in 1947, when Mr. McCloy became&#13;
&#13;
president, that the Board has either remotely acted as if it&#13;
&#13;
wanted to regain some of the power, so to speak, which it had had&#13;
&#13;
before Mr. McCloy?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    No.   But thatâ&#128;&#153;s an over-simplified question.   What I&#13;
&#13;
said about differences between board members affects the question&#13;
&#13;
of what the board as such does.     Different people on the board&#13;
&#13;
have done different things at different times or expressed&#13;
&#13;
different desires at different times.     And even if they didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
have their way, itâ&#128;&#153;s important to know what different sectors of&#13;
&#13;
the board or different interests on the board might have wanted&#13;
&#13;
even though they didnâ&#128;&#153;t carry the weight of votes.     Youâ&#128;&#153;ll recall&#13;
&#13;
what I said about weighted voting and its great contribution to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 54 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the work of the Bank and the speed with which the Bank can work.&#13;
&#13;
But nevertheless, from the standpoint of, let us say, even&#13;
&#13;
disaffection in the board, I could answer you formally at once&#13;
&#13;
and say there has never been any disaffection in the board.    But&#13;
&#13;
this would not take account of the corridor complaints, as they&#13;
&#13;
might be called, which happen frequently, will always happen,&#13;
&#13;
when an executive director or a group of Executive Directors&#13;
&#13;
whose votes would never be sufficient to affect a decision even&#13;
&#13;
remotely, nevertheless expressed themselves as being against some&#13;
&#13;
action that was taken or preferring some modified action to be&#13;
&#13;
taken.   This goes on all the time, and if the character of the&#13;
&#13;
board is understood, the strength of the personalities on it&#13;
&#13;
understood, itâ&#128;&#153;s easy to appreciate that a decision might be&#13;
&#13;
taken by the board in meeting assembled, and three, four or five&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors come and discuss afterwards aspects that they&#13;
&#13;
perhaps didnâ&#128;&#153;t like.   There have not been many negative votes in&#13;
&#13;
the history of the board.   I think they could probably be counted&#13;
&#13;
on the fingers of both hands.    But when I say negative votes, I&#13;
&#13;
do not mean a vote against a proposal of the chair.   I mean&#13;
&#13;
individual negative votes registered against a decision that was&#13;
&#13;
taken.   And such negative votes had usually been by one executive&#13;
&#13;
director for some provincial reason of his own.   The decisions,&#13;
&#13;
while not always unanimous, are nearly always unanimous and when&#13;
&#13;
they havenâ&#128;&#153;t been unanimous, have been unanimous less one or&#13;
&#13;
perhaps in a case or two less two.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 55 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     But there is always a resurgence, for example, of a desire&#13;
&#13;
of the board to have more and more information, let us say about&#13;
&#13;
loans, in which case the detail can be endless.     And these&#13;
&#13;
resurgences come with the entry of a new board every two years.&#13;
&#13;
Fortunately, after every biennial election, a goodly proportion&#13;
&#13;
of the board remains the same.    In the first place the appointed&#13;
&#13;
members do not have terms that necessarily coincide with the&#13;
&#13;
biennial elections in September.    So that our new directors are&#13;
&#13;
not likely to be in a majority.    However, the new brooms always&#13;
&#13;
sweep a bit more industriously than the old ones did and&#13;
&#13;
frequently we face repetition of situations in the matter of&#13;
&#13;
information to the board, for example.     This is a question which&#13;
&#13;
can never be fully determined.    The board can never receive, let&#13;
&#13;
us say, on a loan the endless amount of information and detail&#13;
&#13;
that is gone over by a working party at the lower staff levels in&#13;
&#13;
the first instances.   But yet I have had Executive Directors in&#13;
&#13;
the first flush of their taking office say to me in all&#13;
&#13;
seriousness they could not pass upon a loan successfully or&#13;
&#13;
constructively if they hadnâ&#128;&#153;t been over the entire ground and the&#13;
&#13;
same ground as the lower reaches of the staff.     An argument like&#13;
&#13;
that has a seeming plausibility.    And an executive director with&#13;
&#13;
his ardor and zeal to work, when it is pointed out to him that he&#13;
&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#153;t possibly, in 24 hours a day, cover the detailed work&#13;
&#13;
being done in different sectors of the staff and do it all&#13;
&#13;
himself, you discourage but you donâ&#128;&#153;t always persuade such an&#13;
&#13;
executive director.    Heâ&#128;&#153;s too new.    When he has acquired enough&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 56 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
experience and begins to see the amount of information that is&#13;
&#13;
given to the board regarding the operations of the Bank, he soon&#13;
&#13;
finds that even if he disagrees in principle, there are&#13;
&#13;
limitations of the time and space which prevent him from having&#13;
&#13;
his way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do directors ever sit in on meetings of the staff loan&#13;
&#13;
committee, for example?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Never.   As a matter of fact, the suggestion that they&#13;
&#13;
should in the whole history of the Bank has been made by two&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors at different timesâ&#128;&#148;one in 1952 or â&#128;&#152;3 and one&#13;
&#13;
about 1955.   One was a Dane and the second was an Icelander.&#13;
&#13;
Obviously (at least obviously to the staff and perhaps not quite&#13;
&#13;
so obviously to the Executive Directors), it is literally&#13;
&#13;
impossible that Executive Directors, representing and being close&#13;
&#13;
to their principals, should participate in the objective staff&#13;
&#13;
discussions which take place and which frequently might have to&#13;
&#13;
consider conditions critical of a particular country.     The talk&#13;
&#13;
around a staff table is much more open, much franker, than it can&#13;
&#13;
ever be around the more protocolish board table.    Therefore, to&#13;
&#13;
try to mix staff and board except on some particular board matter&#13;
&#13;
with staff serving the board would be a mistake, in my opinion,&#13;
&#13;
surely as a working mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 57 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do the Executive Directors ever go directly to a staff member&#13;
&#13;
to ask for information about a loan or anything else?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:    Yes, or any other information, yes.   My office tries to&#13;
&#13;
encourage Executive Directors to come to us for anything that&#13;
&#13;
they may require, whether itâ&#128;&#153;s information or whether itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
administration, housekeeping, anything at all.    We prefer them to&#13;
&#13;
tread the path to our office.    In that way we can dispose of half&#13;
&#13;
of the queries and inquiries and direct the remaining half.&#13;
&#13;
Obviously my office is better suited to indicate the proper&#13;
&#13;
person to answer a question than the director himself can.    This&#13;
&#13;
works extremely well.   But this is not to say that a director&#13;
&#13;
whoâ&#128;&#153;s been in the Bank for, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, eight or ten years hasnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
learned his way around sufficiently to go to staff members&#13;
&#13;
directly.   Now, thereâ&#128;&#153;s no formal prohibition of that.   I usually&#13;
&#13;
hear of it.   If I do, I try to persuade the executive director&#13;
&#13;
that while obviously we canâ&#128;&#153;t stop him dealing with staff, we&#13;
&#13;
prefer that he deal only with department heads as being more in&#13;
&#13;
keeping with his status.    This helps to keep the contacts with&#13;
&#13;
the staff from getting too broad.    This works rather well, though&#13;
&#13;
it isnâ&#128;&#153;t a complete practice.    And here again, you frequently run&#13;
&#13;
into the occasional individual who tries to get what he considers&#13;
&#13;
information from the best sources and will insist on going to the&#13;
&#13;
appropriate staff member.   Depending on the nature of his&#13;
&#13;
question, itâ&#128;&#153;s not difficult to agree or disagree with him.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 58 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     On the question of management and Executive Directors,&#13;
&#13;
especially in what we might call the Black era, one&#13;
&#13;
characteristic of the Executive Directors which I have not&#13;
&#13;
hitherto mentioned is the fact that in their own minds, thanks to&#13;
&#13;
their background and experience, positions they have held, their&#13;
&#13;
relations with their countries and so on, they are certainly all&#13;
&#13;
qualified to manage the Bank.    This means a certain inherent&#13;
&#13;
competition and rivalry, however subordinated it may be in their&#13;
&#13;
minds under a working arrangement.       Therefore, the secretary of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank frequently finds himself in the position of being&#13;
&#13;
between the two agencies.   A desire on the part of a board member&#13;
&#13;
for a meeting on a particular subject and a reluctance on the&#13;
&#13;
part of management to have such a meeting will confound the&#13;
&#13;
secretary frequently, in his efforts to leave both sides&#13;
&#13;
reasonably happy, though this obviously must be done by way of&#13;
&#13;
either holding the meeting or not holding the meeting.&#13;
&#13;
     Another problem, which arises from your question about&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors going directly to staff, is the desire of&#13;
&#13;
Executive Directors to advance the interests of their own&#13;
&#13;
constituents as much as possible.    Now, obviously, though this is&#13;
&#13;
by no means a settled question, in my opinion, the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors are representatives.    This is not accepted by everyone,&#13;
&#13;
and itâ&#128;&#153;s a question which has been debated since the beginning of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, as to whether or not they are in fact representatives&#13;
&#13;
or rather members of an integrated board running the Bank in an&#13;
&#13;
objective sense.   Many argue the latter.     I think the position is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 59 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
untenable in a board where the five most important members&#13;
&#13;
representing the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s five largest shareholders hold the&#13;
&#13;
majority of the votes and are appointees.   Obviously, the&#13;
&#13;
appointee is a representative and canâ&#128;&#153;t be anything else.     Heâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
&#13;
complete tool and chattel.   And therefore, if there were any&#13;
&#13;
conflict of interest at all on the board table he must go the way&#13;
&#13;
of his constituentâ&#128;&#153;s interest.    Once you have that core&#13;
&#13;
necessarily operating in this way and adding to that that&#13;
&#13;
percentage of the remaining directors, the elected directors, who&#13;
&#13;
operate the same way, youâ&#128;&#153;ll find that in every board you have a&#13;
&#13;
preponderant majority who are representatives in fact.      I admit&#13;
&#13;
that there may be an odd case produced where I would have to say,&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Yes, that man acts as a proper member of the board and is not a&#13;
&#13;
representative.â&#128;?   But it will be rare.&#13;
&#13;
     That being the case, the complex business of board&#13;
&#13;
operation is further complicated by the desire carried out in as&#13;
&#13;
many different ways as there are people of Executive Directors to&#13;
&#13;
advance the interests of their own particular principals.&#13;
&#13;
     This means that we sometimes encounter some difficulties&#13;
&#13;
when, let us say, a country is coming in for its first loan.     An&#13;
&#13;
executive director full of enthusiasm and full of activity will&#13;
&#13;
endeavor to arrange everything.   Try to have the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
researches expedited as much as possible, will want his countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
negotiators to be asked to come as soon as possible.   He will try&#13;
&#13;
to shepherd them around and try to enter into conversations&#13;
&#13;
including the Bank people and the negotiators.   Now, itâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 60 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
mistake for an executive director to enter negotiations in any&#13;
&#13;
shape or form.   He has to sit in judgment later.    However&#13;
&#13;
theoretical that may be, nevertheless, he does sit in judgment&#13;
&#13;
later as a member of the board and therefore should notâ&#128;&#148;and itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
pretty generally understood that he does notâ&#128;&#148;enter into the&#13;
&#13;
negotiations.    But thereâ&#128;&#153;s an amazing ingenuity shown over the&#13;
&#13;
years by Executive Directors, who have tried to persuade me that&#13;
&#13;
something they have done did not fall under the head of&#13;
&#13;
negotiations.    One can always split hairs.   They have done&#13;
&#13;
everything from merely introduce newly arrived negotiators whom&#13;
&#13;
they knew to a counterpart in the Bank with whom they were going&#13;
&#13;
to negotiate, right down to trying to eavesdrop on the actual&#13;
&#13;
negotiations, and yet insisted that they were not getting into&#13;
&#13;
negotiation.&#13;
&#13;
     But, again, if the makeup of the board is understood; if&#13;
&#13;
the atmosphere in the board room is understood; 68 or 70&#13;
&#13;
countries represented by the first 18 and alternates and&#13;
&#13;
understand their psychologies and understand their aims and&#13;
&#13;
ambitionsâ&#128;&#148;both as described in the Articles of Agreement and as&#13;
&#13;
encountered in actual factâ&#128;&#148;and their own desires to advance the&#13;
&#13;
interests behind them, you begin to see the kind of engine that&#13;
&#13;
you have.   And yet over it all, this engine must operate&#13;
&#13;
constructively and in such a way as to not get into the day-to-&#13;
&#13;
day activities of the Bank and of the staff of the Bank in a way&#13;
&#13;
that might make those activities less expeditious, less&#13;
&#13;
satisfactory, that they are up to now.&#13;
&#13;

                               - 61 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How about the working of the Executive Directors in the other&#13;
&#13;
direction?   That is to say, do they sometimes help interpret the&#13;
&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s actions to their members?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   This is regarded by us as the principal duty and&#13;
&#13;
function of the Executive Directors, although here again the wide&#13;
&#13;
variety of directors prevents me from saying that they do or they&#13;
&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t do this function very well.   Executive directors work in&#13;
&#13;
different ways.   Iâ&#128;&#153;ll mention one principal way.    Let us take the&#13;
&#13;
question of their reporting to their member countries or&#13;
&#13;
consulting with their member countries or informing their member&#13;
&#13;
countriesâ&#128;&#148;that basic core of their relationship with member&#13;
&#13;
countries.   Well, there are Executive Directors who have been&#13;
&#13;
finance ministers of their own countries who have run their&#13;
&#13;
ministries and have been on top for years.   Such men when they&#13;
&#13;
become Executive Directors are hardly likely to play post officeâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
that is, to take the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s documentation and automatically put&#13;
&#13;
it in the mail and send it home each time and then wait for&#13;
&#13;
things to happen.   Such men are more likely to sit masterfully in&#13;
&#13;
their offices, look at all the documentation that comes their&#13;
&#13;
way, give decisions for the most part in line with what they&#13;
&#13;
think are their countryâ&#128;&#153;s interests and desire, consult only when&#13;
&#13;
they consider that they have a particular problem and then do so&#13;
&#13;
briefly.   Now, you run from that type of director down the whole&#13;
&#13;
scale to the man at the bottom who perhaps after a term of two&#13;
&#13;
years or four years hasnâ&#128;&#153;t even grasped the beginnings of what&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 62 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
goes on in the Bank, whose method of operation is to get&#13;
&#13;
sufficient copies of every paper he gets, even a notice that&#13;
&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#153;ll be a lunch some day, and send copies to each one of the&#13;
&#13;
countries he may represent.   Certainly heâ&#128;&#153;s right in thinking&#13;
&#13;
that he is keeping his country fully informed.   He is not right&#13;
&#13;
in thinking that such information is of much value, because,&#13;
&#13;
again to be realistic, these packages of paper arrive on some&#13;
&#13;
desk in the home government; no man in any important position is&#13;
&#13;
ever going to thumb through it even.   Some clerk will, and the&#13;
&#13;
net result will be far less than the results obtained by the man&#13;
&#13;
at the other end of the scale who perhaps sends a cable off once&#13;
&#13;
every two months and gets a quick answer.   And, again, in between&#13;
&#13;
these two poles are all the variations that will take you from&#13;
&#13;
one to the other.&#13;
&#13;
     I have known Executive Directors who have taken&#13;
&#13;
mimeographed papers of the Bank, perhaps 20 or 30 pages long, and&#13;
&#13;
have had them all re-stenciled because they added at the&#13;
&#13;
beginning:   â&#128;&#156;The following paper was received by our office&#13;
&#13;
today,â&#128;? and then proceeded to repeat the whole paper.   This is a&#13;
&#13;
very extreme case, but it will give you an indication of one end&#13;
&#13;
of the pole; and the really statesmen-like operation by Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors at the other end of the pole doesnâ&#128;&#153;t need further&#13;
&#13;
description.&#13;
&#13;
     The function of not just interpreting the Bank to member&#13;
&#13;
countries but explainingâ&#128;&#148;I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to say justifying but I&#13;
&#13;
mean explaining almost to the point of justificationâ&#128;&#148;this is an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 63 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
endless task which ought to be the directorâ&#128;&#153;s first job and at&#13;
&#13;
which, Iâ&#128;&#153;m afraid, not as much has been done as might have been.&#13;
&#13;
However, we on the staff lose no opportunities of pointing out to&#13;
&#13;
the Executive Directors that this is regarded as their first&#13;
&#13;
function.&#13;
&#13;
     I should say, however, that whenever specific instances&#13;
&#13;
have arisen, the large amount of money that we have obtained in&#13;
&#13;
the last year or two from Germany, for example, might not have&#13;
&#13;
been so obtained if it hadnâ&#128;&#153;t been for the great efforts and&#13;
&#13;
great activity of the German executive director.    This is a case&#13;
&#13;
in point.   The French executive director has always tried, ably,&#13;
&#13;
to interpret the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s views on the hiring of staff to the&#13;
&#13;
French government, which entertained rather different views.    Our&#13;
&#13;
relations with the Indian and the Pakistan governments through&#13;
&#13;
the whole gamut of the loans that have been made to these&#13;
&#13;
countries, the whole Indus River negotiation and settlementâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
there, again, the directors have necessarily been useful&#13;
&#13;
intermediaries, although the accomplishments and tasks have been&#13;
&#13;
so great that there has been much more in the way of go-between.&#13;
&#13;
The Directors have been more than useful.   And so the list is a&#13;
&#13;
long one of individual cases where directors have realized the&#13;
&#13;
need for being a bridge between country and Bank and have carried&#13;
&#13;
it out.&#13;
&#13;
     The way in which it has perhaps not worked to our greatest&#13;
&#13;
satisfaction is the general everyday instinctive way.    Our Latin-&#13;
&#13;
American directors, to quote another example (and I like to quote&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 64 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
these specific examples just to keep the heterogeneous nature of&#13;
&#13;
the board in front of our eyes all the time), are performing this&#13;
&#13;
function largely in reverse.   This is not to say that there&#13;
&#13;
arenâ&#128;&#153;t some who donâ&#128;&#153;t do it that way.   But for the most part they&#13;
&#13;
are engaged in a long, sometimes bitter haranguing of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
because the Bank neither lends enough nor lends fast enough nor&#13;
&#13;
gives enough technical assistance to Latin-American countries.&#13;
&#13;
This at least is the story.    The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s rather different story&#13;
&#13;
has been explained many times both to them and their countries.&#13;
&#13;
But nevertheless it is true that the Bank will always be able to&#13;
&#13;
be accused of not lending enough and not spending fast enough by&#13;
&#13;
any group of members.   There is no ceiling.   And this is the kind&#13;
&#13;
of one-way traffic which we will try over the years to make a&#13;
&#13;
two-way trafficâ&#128;&#148;increase the amount of interpretation going&#13;
&#13;
through the Latin American directors to their countries rather&#13;
&#13;
than be at the receiving and almost continually of a long series&#13;
&#13;
of traditional complaints.&#13;
&#13;
     The workings of the Executive Directors. . . And I think&#13;
&#13;
the most important function which the Secretary of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
performs is the completely unwritten function of being between&#13;
&#13;
the directors and the management or the directors and the staff,&#13;
&#13;
not just as collective entities because the collective entities&#13;
&#13;
break down into individual performances.   And so the board&#13;
&#13;
operation might be described sometimes as 18 different&#13;
&#13;
operations.   Each chair has its own foibles and its own&#13;
&#13;
requirements and its own tasks.   Similarly, the management.   You&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 65 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
might be dealing with Mr. Black one day, Mr. Garner another, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Knapp a third.   Or none of them at all might be around at a&#13;
&#13;
particular moment.    The directors always are.   And itâ&#128;&#153;s on this&#13;
&#13;
day-to-day basis that one has to try to understand the working of&#13;
&#13;
an agency such as our Executive Directors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I wonder if thereâ&#128;&#153;s any significant contrast between Mr.&#13;
&#13;
McCloyâ&#128;&#153;s and Mr. Blackâ&#128;&#153;s attitudes toward the board.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   This is difficult to describe, because basically both&#13;
&#13;
men, I think, had similar views about the way in which the&#13;
&#13;
executive director should work.   That is, the nature of their&#13;
&#13;
meetings, the nature of their agendas, the type of proceeding&#13;
&#13;
that they should have, the scope of their activity, the extent of&#13;
&#13;
their jurisdictionâ&#128;&#148;I think both had similar ideas.    And I think&#13;
&#13;
that any experienced or legally minded functionary would agree&#13;
&#13;
with them.    The only ones who wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t agree with them might be&#13;
&#13;
some board members from time to time.   This board has to be&#13;
&#13;
fitted into an organization that intends to function well, wants&#13;
&#13;
to function well; and a top board which has to make decision&#13;
&#13;
obviously has to make decisions on a narrower compass of&#13;
&#13;
information, of discussion and of operation than the staff.     This&#13;
&#13;
is something that there will always be board members who do not&#13;
&#13;
understand.   So that as far as the basic appreciation of board&#13;
&#13;
operation goes, I think Mr. McCloy and Mr. Black were generally&#13;
&#13;
of the same mind.    And our board operation today is in general&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 66 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
what it was under Mr. McCloy.    The basic rules governing the&#13;
&#13;
procedure of the board were written in Mr. McCloyâ&#128;&#153;s day and have&#13;
&#13;
not suffered much amendment.&#13;
&#13;
     It is an understanding more of what I have been discussing&#13;
&#13;
this morning, the nature of the board, the personalities, the&#13;
&#13;
character of the personalities and so on, and trying to&#13;
&#13;
accommodate to themâ&#128;&#148;not so much as a matter of board operation&#13;
&#13;
but as a matter of individuals, a matter of mutual understanding,&#13;
&#13;
as a matter of mutual pleasing almost.    And there we have a great&#13;
&#13;
difference between Mr. Black and Mr. McCloy.&#13;
&#13;
     Now, one can say that Mr. McCloy, who always remained an&#13;
&#13;
extremely busy individual, didnâ&#128;&#153;t have the time.    Neither man has&#13;
&#13;
the time, as it happens.    I think that Mr. Black found a little&#13;
&#13;
more in which to explore the personalities that sat around the&#13;
&#13;
boardâ&#128;&#148;socially, for example.    I have found it easier to make&#13;
&#13;
suggestions to Mr. Black that he have the directors to dinner&#13;
&#13;
every so often at home.    Mr. Black himself organizes or insists&#13;
&#13;
upon occasional trips over short distances to see local sights.&#13;
&#13;
He took the board to Princeton and had a discussion with the&#13;
&#13;
faculty there on common problems.    Weâ&#128;&#153;ve had the board down to&#13;
&#13;
reconstructed Williamsburg.    At the moment Iâ&#128;&#153;m planning a trip&#13;
&#13;
next fall to TVA for them.    Mr. Black thinks of a lot of these&#13;
&#13;
things on his ownâ&#128;&#148;everything from a formal dinner every so often&#13;
&#13;
down to a baseball night.    This is popular with the board.   This&#13;
&#13;
provides a bond of everyday contact outside the sheerly formal&#13;
&#13;
business type of contact which has been extremely successful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 67 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And it is in this respect that Mr. Black has been much more&#13;
&#13;
forthcoming.   Similarly, within the confines of our day-to-day&#13;
&#13;
work within the walls of the offices, Mr. Black shows a little of&#13;
&#13;
the same difference.   The Secretary of the Bank is required to&#13;
&#13;
have his office close to Mr. Blackâ&#128;&#153;s.   The reason for that is&#13;
&#13;
that he has to be known to have access; so that an executive&#13;
&#13;
director who cannot see Mr. Black when heâ&#128;&#153;d like to can at least&#13;
&#13;
get hold of the Secretary and between them if itâ&#128;&#153;s urgent enough&#13;
&#13;
or serious enough they know they have access to Mr. Black.      This&#13;
&#13;
is very important.    Mr. McCloy showed rather less interest in&#13;
&#13;
that kind of thing.    And it is this type of extremely human&#13;
&#13;
sociable and amiable behavior that has largely made the&#13;
&#13;
difference between Mr. Black and Mr. McCloy.&#13;
&#13;
      Now, this does not mean, to my mind, any serious difference&#13;
&#13;
in the results accomplished by the Bank in its work as such.      It&#13;
&#13;
has meant, however, a much happier time even when there have been&#13;
&#13;
differences and sharp differencesâ&#128;&#148;a much happier time within the&#13;
&#13;
shop insofar as director relationship with management is&#13;
&#13;
concerned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you know of any occasions when specific directors have&#13;
&#13;
resigned their offices because they thought that they were not&#13;
&#13;
important enough to occupy their time?â&#128;&#148;perhaps in the early days?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   That is hard to say, because there may have been.    We&#13;
&#13;
wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t necessarily know.   The question of an executive director&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 68 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
terminating his office is a question between him and his&#13;
&#13;
principals.   And while itâ&#128;&#153;s true that some of us learn a great&#13;
&#13;
deal about what goes on between a director and his principals, on&#13;
&#13;
a subject of that kind, all the motivations that would enter into&#13;
&#13;
a directorâ&#128;&#153;s mind that might have him seek a different post,&#13;
&#13;
letâ&#128;&#153;s say, might or might not include the consideration that you&#13;
&#13;
mention.   What would happen, I think would be that might have him&#13;
&#13;
seek a different post, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, might or might not include the&#13;
&#13;
consideration that you mention.   What would happen, I think would&#13;
&#13;
be that on visits home, which Executive Directors take regularly,&#13;
&#13;
the subject might come up.   A minister might tell his executive&#13;
&#13;
director that he has a particular problem which heâ&#128;&#153;d like the&#13;
&#13;
executive director to take on, which might mean a job at home.&#13;
&#13;
The executive director might say that he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t consider the job&#13;
&#13;
a very useful one or one that is occupying his energies&#13;
&#13;
sufficiently and ask for a change, which is frequently easy to&#13;
&#13;
arrange at that level.&#13;
&#13;
     What would happen more often, however, (and here again we&#13;
&#13;
would not know the negotiations that would lead up to the&#13;
&#13;
conclusion), is that an executive director would say to his&#13;
&#13;
principals that heâ&#128;&#153;s not fully occupied and ask to be given&#13;
&#13;
something else to do.    Five or six of our directors also sit on&#13;
&#13;
the Fund board.   And you must remember also that the Bank board&#13;
&#13;
has had an increasing diet of work with the creation of IFC in&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#153;55 and IDA in â&#128;&#152;6, so that the ability to keep busy is much&#13;
&#13;
easier than it used to be.   However, if a director arranged to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 69 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
leave office for that very reason and only that reason, I&#13;
&#13;
wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t know.   I might, if I went down the list of every&#13;
&#13;
incumbent, spot one or two that I did know at the time.   But&#13;
&#13;
offhand, no.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I wonder if you could contrast the development of the board&#13;
&#13;
in the Fund with the development of the board in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Thatâ&#128;&#153;s an interesting question.   I think a contrast of&#13;
&#13;
that kind would only be useful if it has placed alongside it the&#13;
&#13;
same contrast made by, let us say, the Secretary of the Fund or&#13;
&#13;
somebody in the Fund.   Certainly in the early days there was some&#13;
&#13;
similarity.    When I say the early days, I mean the first six&#13;
&#13;
months, and we have described those, of great board activity, not&#13;
&#13;
necessarily conclusive, and an uncertain jurisdiction.    In the&#13;
&#13;
Fund the board early took a very strong position and remained&#13;
&#13;
dominant over management.   The Fund did not have such items in&#13;
&#13;
its history as the interregnum, which weâ&#128;&#153;ve been over, did not&#13;
&#13;
have the kind of advent that the Bank had in March 17, â&#128;&#153;47, when&#13;
&#13;
McCloy came in; did not have a rather delicate survey of the&#13;
&#13;
position of Executive Directors which the Bank had in 1948 to â&#128;&#153;50&#13;
&#13;
or so.   So that the Fund board in carrying out the amount of&#13;
&#13;
power that it had taken unto itself, whatever that was, but&#13;
&#13;
greater than it was in the Bank, if you like, had no&#13;
&#13;
interruptions of any kind in its history.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 70 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Now, also, itâ&#128;&#153;s important to remember that the functions of&#13;
&#13;
the Fund, particularly those in which the board participate, are&#13;
&#13;
entirely different from the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s.     Theyâ&#128;&#153;re much more complex.&#13;
&#13;
They engage the principals behind the directors much more than&#13;
&#13;
the work of the Bank.    A monetary question that might be before&#13;
&#13;
the Fund is a question that when resolved affects the whole&#13;
&#13;
character of the community that is concerned, and also the&#13;
&#13;
interrelationship of monetary questions around the board table of&#13;
&#13;
the Fund, where the action by one affects others, does bring in&#13;
&#13;
the need for much closer, perhaps more frequent or more&#13;
&#13;
continuous consultation than required by the work of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
So that you have a basic difference, fundamental difference, at&#13;
&#13;
the outset, and to this must be added whatever the effects are of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank having had its curious history and the Fund not having&#13;
&#13;
any counterpart of it.&#13;
&#13;
     The Fund used to meet extremely often, and, as a matter of&#13;
&#13;
fact, it was the need for such continuous meetings that gave the&#13;
&#13;
two organizations the kind of boards they have, since the Bank&#13;
&#13;
emulated the Fund board insofar as organization and structure was&#13;
&#13;
concerned.&#13;
&#13;
     So that the Fund board from the start exercised a wider&#13;
&#13;
authority and retained that authority to this day.     Some changes&#13;
&#13;
have taken place.   The Fund boardâ&#128;&#153;s procedure is today much&#13;
&#13;
closer to that of the Bank.    They meet less often.   The staff, I&#13;
&#13;
think, does more; but the supervision of the board is still&#13;
&#13;
closer than in the Bank.    To cite a small example, Iâ&#128;&#153;m informed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 71 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that in the case of the Fund the board must approve appointments&#13;
&#13;
to positions that carry salaries of $5000 or more.   It doesnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
matter whether itâ&#128;&#153;s $5000 or $6000 or $7000, but itâ&#128;&#153;s of that&#13;
&#13;
order.   The board approved those.   The ostensible reason was to&#13;
&#13;
insure that there would be sufficiently broad geographical&#13;
&#13;
distribution, and only the board would attend to that.&#13;
&#13;
     In the Bank, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s need for the same broad&#13;
&#13;
geographical distribution has been watched by the management as&#13;
&#13;
far as possible.   The Bank has never accepted the view that&#13;
&#13;
considerations of the proper person for the proper job, for the&#13;
&#13;
available job, should be subordinated to reasons of geographical&#13;
&#13;
distribution.&#13;
&#13;
     Again, from the nature of the board as it has been&#13;
&#13;
described, once such questions reach the table, then the whole&#13;
&#13;
play of politics comes in and itâ&#128;&#153;s difficult to lay down&#13;
&#13;
standards for the conclusions they reach.&#13;
&#13;
     Now, in the Bank, the president of the Bank retains the&#13;
&#13;
right to hire and fire the staff.    As a matter of practice,&#13;
&#13;
however, he would not appoint, let us say, a department headâ&#128;&#148;not&#13;
&#13;
to speak of a vice-presidentâ&#128;&#148;or even an assistant department&#13;
&#13;
head, although that might not be completely general, without&#13;
&#13;
informing the board, let me put it that way.   But the informing&#13;
&#13;
of the board is almost with a semi-consultative aspect, while&#13;
&#13;
safeguarding completely that the appointment is his to make, but&#13;
&#13;
at that level, which is vastly higher than the level of approval&#13;
&#13;
of appointments by the Fund board.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 72 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Now, that gives you a sample and a general idea of the&#13;
&#13;
differences.   I think today the Fund executive board, by dint of&#13;
&#13;
the reasons I have given you, and because of certain strong&#13;
&#13;
personalities on it, some of whom have been on it a long time,&#13;
&#13;
exercises a good deal more power over the staff and in the work&#13;
&#13;
of the Fund than is the case in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     With the advent of Per Jacobsson some five years ago, that&#13;
&#13;
trend again has turned and approached the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s method of&#13;
&#13;
operation a bit more, though it is not the same.    Mr. Jacobsson&#13;
&#13;
is, I think, proving to be the strongest chairman that the Fund&#13;
&#13;
board has had; and this has had the effect of bringing the Fund&#13;
&#13;
board operation closer to the methods followed by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
However, the different nature of the Fundâ&#128;&#153;s work must always, I&#13;
&#13;
think, bring some difference in the way the Fund board must work.&#13;
&#13;
     I think one other indication of the greater power of the&#13;
&#13;
Fund is that, for example, in the administrative and housekeeping&#13;
&#13;
field the Fund board pretty well determines for itself, through a&#13;
&#13;
system of committee operation and what-not, how it shall be&#13;
&#13;
housekept.   In the case of the Bank, the Bank board and the&#13;
&#13;
administration of the Bank board is a matter for the chairman in&#13;
&#13;
consultation with the Boardâ&#128;&#148;and making the recommendations as he&#13;
&#13;
does in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s more professional work.   Needless to say, a&#13;
&#13;
lot of that falls on the Secretary, but it makes for more&#13;
&#13;
businesslike operation than any policy that would involve&#13;
&#13;
considerations of â&#128;&#156;scratch my back and I scratch yours.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 73 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you comment about the system of weighted voting?        Is it&#13;
&#13;
generally conceded that the United States executive director&#13;
&#13;
almost by himself can carry the day if it really becomes a matter&#13;
&#13;
of a difference of opinion on some controversial issue?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   Here again there have been too many over-simple&#13;
&#13;
statements made.   Now, I have said that I donâ&#128;&#153;t think the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
success would have been the same without weight ability.      In&#13;
&#13;
fact, if the Bank had had voting by heads, as in more political&#13;
&#13;
organizations like United Nations, Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure that it could&#13;
&#13;
have kept above water at all.    This may sound undemocratic, but&#13;
&#13;
itâ&#128;&#153;s extremely factual.   However, the system of weighted voting&#13;
&#13;
has, I suppose, contributed to the impression gained in some&#13;
&#13;
quarters that the Bank is pretty much the tool of its largest&#13;
&#13;
shareholder, the United States.    Now, in my opinion, itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
perfectly true that any country, whether itâ&#128;&#153;s the United States&#13;
&#13;
or Russia or Canada or Utopia, that has the kind of position in&#13;
&#13;
the world which warrants its owning a third, roughly, of a bank&#13;
&#13;
such as the World Bank, such a country has from that position the&#13;
&#13;
kind of relationship with other countries that would frequently&#13;
&#13;
permit that third to become 51% on any burning issue.    Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no&#13;
&#13;
argument about that.   My own country, Canada, on most questions&#13;
&#13;
which appear on the board table, and in which they have no direct&#13;
&#13;
interest of any kind whatsoever, will find it a sufficient reason&#13;
&#13;
to go along with the U.S., and so for many others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 74 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Now, two influences work the other way and are important.&#13;
&#13;
The first is that there is rarely any voting.   The weighted&#13;
&#13;
system permits consensus to be detected on any question early.&#13;
&#13;
Speaking from sitting at many, many such meetings with a folder&#13;
&#13;
containing ballots and tally sheets, I might scrawl on a tally&#13;
&#13;
sheet while talking is going on, but it isnâ&#128;&#153;t often necessary.&#13;
&#13;
You can tell from the minute thereâ&#128;&#153;s been some discussion, early&#13;
&#13;
in any discussion, how the wind blows, and you know where a&#13;
&#13;
decision is going.   Thatâ&#128;&#153;s one influence.&#13;
&#13;
       Another important influence has been the handling of its&#13;
&#13;
third by the United States, which in the case of the Bank has&#13;
&#13;
been most enlightened.    The United States has not (let us leave&#13;
&#13;
out the first six months of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s history when nothing much&#13;
&#13;
was accomplished) through its director or otherwise endeavored to&#13;
&#13;
steer the recommendations which come to the board only from the&#13;
&#13;
chair; and this despite the fact of a chairman being an American&#13;
&#13;
citizen.   Sometimes that is also brought up.   Curiously enough, I&#13;
&#13;
think that the criticism of being under the thumb of the United&#13;
&#13;
States has been made more often in the direction of the Fund,&#13;
&#13;
which has had no American heads, than in the case of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
with its American head.   This can be easily explained.   The man&#13;
&#13;
who is president of the World Bank, who has hitherto always been&#13;
&#13;
an American citizen, has been chosen for that job because he&#13;
&#13;
enjoys the respect of the U.S. government.   They have nominated&#13;
&#13;
him.   He has been selected by the board after the nomination.     I&#13;
&#13;
think thereâ&#128;&#153;s a little of the fact that you can let one of your&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 75 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
own go farther than not, than one who is not your own, in the&#13;
&#13;
minds of U.S. administrations up to now.    But in any case,&#13;
&#13;
however the reasoning has gone, we have had most enlightened&#13;
&#13;
treatment.   One might almost say we have properly been left alone&#13;
&#13;
by our largest shareholderâ&#128;&#148;this also despite the fact that we&#13;
&#13;
live in the same city.    So that in this respect, and from the&#13;
&#13;
standpoint of being able to use a big stick within the Bank if it&#13;
&#13;
chose, there has been none of that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Would you make an exception in the case of the Polish loan?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mendels:   I thought youâ&#128;&#153;d say that.    I donâ&#128;&#153;t even make an&#13;
&#13;
exception in the case of the Polish loan, although my memories of&#13;
&#13;
the Polish loan wonâ&#128;&#153;t be as good as some of those who have worked&#13;
&#13;
on it.   But my recollection is that unless you choose to charge&#13;
&#13;
the creation of the whole Marshall Plan as a diabolical plot on&#13;
&#13;
the part of the United States to prevent us from making a Polish&#13;
&#13;
loan, unless youâ&#128;&#153;re prepared to take that position, then I would&#13;
&#13;
say that no big stick was used on the Polish loan.    These&#13;
&#13;
situations are all matters of interpretation, but some of us, I&#13;
&#13;
think, have been close enough to them so that our interpretations&#13;
&#13;
might be more accurate.   Now, the Polish loan had the Bank&#13;
&#13;
divided inside.   There were those who thought it ought to be&#13;
&#13;
made; there were those who thought it oughtnâ&#128;&#153;t to be madeâ&#128;&#148;for all&#13;
&#13;
sorts of reasons.   Unhappily, to my mind, the question wasnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
decided by reason of the considerations that made these two camps&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 76 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Morton M. Mendels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and of any decision as to which was the stronger view.     The&#13;
&#13;
difficulty was that this whole subject was under discussion;&#13;
&#13;
there was a great deal of worry about how to present it to the&#13;
&#13;
board and so on when the Marshall Plan, which had just been&#13;
&#13;
approved, was under consideration.     Yes.   What I think had&#13;
&#13;
happened was that the United States offered Marshall Plan aid to&#13;
&#13;
the Poles, and the Poles turned it down.      This at just the time&#13;
&#13;
when the debate was raging here as to making the loan.     Well, as&#13;
&#13;
far as my memory goes, while there was a lot of informal talk and&#13;
&#13;
I think the Executive Directors were aware of what was going on,&#13;
&#13;
no formal submission was made to the Executive Directors of such&#13;
&#13;
a loan.   And this comes perhaps closest to an example in which&#13;
&#13;
the influence played a part, though not on the initiative of the&#13;
&#13;
U.S.   It does seem to me that a similar situation again would&#13;
&#13;
probably produce a similar result, and for those who would be&#13;
&#13;
critical of that, it does seem to me that it would be doctrinaire&#13;
&#13;
and by our standards highly impractical to ignore a situation of&#13;
&#13;
that kind.   We run into all sorts of imperfect situations which&#13;
&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t suit our theories but nevertheless must be solved if youâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
&#13;
ever to get a chance to practice your theories.     And this is&#13;
&#13;
another one of those imperfect situations where nothing goes as&#13;
&#13;
you would want it.   I think frankly that if that curious&#13;
&#13;
coincidence with the Marshall Plan procedure and the position of&#13;
&#13;
the Poles with regard to the Marshall Plan hadnâ&#128;&#153;t happened at&#13;
&#13;
that particular moment, that the chances are that that loan would&#13;
&#13;
have been grantedâ&#128;&#148;with perhaps some extremely beneficial results&#13;
&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In July 1961, Morton M. Mendels was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert Oliver. During his tenure at the
            Bank from 1946 to 1973, Mr. Mendels worked in the following
            areas: as first secretary of the World Bank (1946-1973) and
            in the department of the secretary as an advisor for the
            bank and fund conferences office (1973). Before that he
            practiced law in Montreal and worked on the Canadian General
            Staff in Ottawa, managing the money of the Canadian Army.
            His transcript concerns his relationship with the executive
            directors of the World Bank, shareholders, the presidencies
            of John McCloy, Eugene Black, George Woods, and Robert
            McNamara, and the Marshall Plan.
