Abstract&#13;
This paper reviews the first stage of global modeling in the World&#13;
Bank.   It summarizes the models and analytical methods which were developed for&#13;
that purpose between 1973 and 1976.   These were in turn based on a large body of&#13;
research and modeling which had taken place before 1973, and the work has&#13;
progressed  since.    However,  the first phase of development remains fairly&#13;
distinct, and is of interest in relation to the impact of the sharp rise in&#13;
petroleum prices on global economic trends in the mid-1970s.&#13;
The system was used to generate projections for the world economy to&#13;
compare alternative policies, mainly in international trade and capital flows.&#13;
The policy conclusions were discussed within the Bank and with other interna-&#13;
tional agencies, and it is worth looking back to evaluate both the analysis and&#13;
the conclusions which    followed.   This evaluation is of particular interest&#13;
because of the large disturbances which occurred in the world economy during&#13;
these years and because of the wide differences which existed with regard to the&#13;
international policies that ought to have been pursued.&#13;
The lessons from this review have already been taken into account in&#13;
the formulation of new tools of analysis.    The system described in the chapters&#13;
which follow was designed in particular to trace the international transmission&#13;
of economic change in the world economy; the system therefore did not suffi-&#13;
ciently address issues of economic and social policy within country groups and&#13;
countries, particularly those related to employment and the distribution of&#13;
income, and sectoral growth and policies. The current stage of the World Bank's&#13;
global modeling efforts (second phase) treats these issues more explicitly,&#13;
within the framework of a coherent global analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv &#13;
Notwithstanding its shortcomings, the global analytical system has&#13;
demonstrated its value throughout the years and has become an essential feature&#13;
of the Bank's economic work.     It will be needed as long as the international&#13;
economic outlook remains characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, and as&#13;
long as the Bank is called on to give its views on current international&#13;
negotiations on future trade and capital flow regimes.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The year 1973 was a turning point in the pattern of world economic&#13;
expansion:   since then, structural changes in the relations between groups of&#13;
countries and also within each of these have taken place, continuing to the&#13;
present day and casting long shadows into the future.     It is not by coincidence&#13;
that this occurred after a long period of sustained and unprecendented economic&#13;
expansion which started in the late 1950s.    The period ended when the expansion&#13;
had  generated   its  own  manageable  consequences  of  inflation,  exchange  rate&#13;
disequilibrium and excess demand.&#13;
Simultaneously, suppliers of scarce commodities essential for the expan-&#13;
sion of the world economy had become increasingly aware of their market strength,&#13;
particularly in the early 1970s; the oil price increase of 1973 reflected a new&#13;
concentration  of international   market  power.    These shocks might have been&#13;
absorbed more readily, had the long expansion been less pronounced and not ended&#13;
in a multitude of internal problems.    To what extent those problems - which were&#13;
not altogether unforeseen - could have been solved through timely international&#13;
action is now a mute question; there is not much relevance in wondering whether&#13;
the prospects for the world economy could have been better or less uncertain.&#13;
The occurrence of the disturbances around 1973 coincided with an&#13;
increased awareness that some of the world's essential resources for development&#13;
were finite.   The long-term prospects for economic expansion were more and more&#13;
seen to be influenced by resource scarcities, whether those be raw materials and&#13;
energy, land, or clean air and water.      These new notions, together made clear&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
that the issues were not just temporary phenomena, but had a bearing on the long-&#13;
run outlook for the world economy.      Suitable policies therefore could only be&#13;
those which helped the necessary restructuring through long-term adjustment, or&#13;
would sustain countries temporarily in order to permit an orderly adjustment&#13;
process. The efforts to establish a New International Economic Order reflect the&#13;
former; the measures to set up emergency funds or special financial facilities&#13;
are examples of the latter.&#13;
The analysis of the new situation was difficult at the time. There were&#13;
no precedents for these developments and the issues were many, complex and&#13;
intertwined.   Existing tools or analysis were inadequate to describe adequately&#13;
what had happened or was still taking place with sufficient regard for the role&#13;
of each group of countries or commodity markets0        As the capability to trace&#13;
through the events was gradually established, it also became clear that a longer-&#13;
term perspective than had been customary in the past was essential0       This posed&#13;
questions and requirements to the analysts of the international economy which&#13;
greatly exceeded their earlier responsibilitieso     But the characteristics of the&#13;
crisis could not be understood otherwise, and a new focus on long-term policies&#13;
of restructuring and adjustment was clearly called for0&#13;
The World Bank tried under those circumstances to adapt existing&#13;
analytic capabilities for global economic studies focused on issues of long-term&#13;
development0    Existing  analytic  tools had earlier been developed within the&#13;
organization  to enhance   the  quality  of country and    project  work.    In  the&#13;
following chapters an account is given of the Bank's analytical instruments and&#13;
of the way in which those were molded and expanded over time to shed light on the&#13;
possible  course of global    economic  events.    The emphasis on the developing&#13;
countries stems logically from the Bank's primary concern with those countries,&#13;
but in this respect the value of its analysis was, to a certain extent, unique0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
The important role which the developing countries played in the global economic&#13;
developments of those years made it feasible to link the Bank's analysis readily&#13;
to the work done by others for different parts of the world or for particular&#13;
markets.   How this was done, and what resulted from this work, is the subject of&#13;
this paper.&#13;
Bank Economic Work: Some Basic Features&#13;
The basic decisions which concern the Bank in determining its operations&#13;
relate to the allocation of lending among member countries, the terms to be&#13;
applied, and the size of the intended operations. Within that framework, further&#13;
decisions are required to select priority sectors and projects.        In the present&#13;
context, the focus is on that part of the work which is directed towards the&#13;
macro-economic issues, although from time to time, the linkages with the more&#13;
detailed operational decisions will be indicated.         The main entity which     is&#13;
addressed in the decision process regarding the broad outlines of lending opera-&#13;
tions is the assessment of country economic positions and prospects.&#13;
The Bank relies for its information about member countries eligible for&#13;
lending on regular economic reports, prepared through field missions by its own&#13;
staff.   These economic reports have a long tradition and are widely used outside&#13;
the Bank.    Many of these are short and mainly concerned with updating of the&#13;
information base and with short- to medium-term developments. More important are&#13;
the Basic Reports, which once about every five years provide a more structural&#13;
analysis with a larger historical and prospective time horizon.         These reports&#13;
are preferably linked to the country's own schedule of medium-term plans, some-&#13;
times to assist with those efforts, or to assess their quality and relevance.&#13;
From time to time, sector surveys are also undertaken separately, particularly in&#13;
those countries in which the Bank expects to support a particular sector&#13;
investment program with regular lending operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
These reports do not suggest any particular level or composition or the&#13;
Bank's oun operations in a country; they are limited to a deccription and&#13;
evaluation of the economic and social environment expected to surround and&#13;
determine  those operations.     A separate, confidential document, the Country&#13;
Program Paper (CPP), is the vehicle for management consideration and decision of&#13;
planned Bank operations.    Rigorously standardized in its format, ft summarizes&#13;
the latest economic information on the country, supplemented by standard tables&#13;
presenting economic projections of graowth, the balance of payments, and external&#13;
indebtedness.   It also summarizes past lending experience in the country and&#13;
recommends levels and terms of future lending uith a five-year time horizon;&#13;
finally it identifies priority sectors and projects and their timing in the&#13;
program.&#13;
The Bank has to stratify its lending progrEm within the confines of its&#13;
financial and staff resources.     The lending decisions for individual countries&#13;
must reflect these constraints, and the criteria applied must permit lnter-&#13;
country and inter-project comparisons. A substantial part of the statistical and&#13;
analytical  work   program  is  therefore  directed   towards  the  compilation  of&#13;
comparable basic information and of standard analytical tools for all borrowing&#13;
countries.   The minimal information required for each country has been steadily&#13;
raised over the years as data and the staff's ability to handle them improved.&#13;
The minimum requirements have come to represent a fairly advanced data and&#13;
modeling capability0   For some of the major developing countries more elaborate&#13;
models continue to be made, particularly to bring into better focus the determi-&#13;
nants and effects of income distribution and employment0          These models are&#13;
capable of assessing policy alternatives more meaningfully than the minimum&#13;
standard approach, but they are as yet too costly to expand their application&#13;
beyond a few selected countries0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Countries are classified by groups according to their per capita incomes&#13;
in order to determine their eligibility for particular lending terms.     Thus, the&#13;
highly concessional International Development Aid (IDA) resources are allocated&#13;
entirely to countries at the lower end of the income scale. At the beginning of&#13;
1978 a ceiling of $550 per capita (in 1976 prices) was applied.          Similarly,&#13;
different terms apply for different per capita income ranges for the Bank&#13;
loans.   The comparison   of countries requires    that a uniform methodology be&#13;
applied to the estimation and conversion of each country's income data.         The&#13;
annually published World Bank Atlas provides such estimates for virtually all&#13;
countries in the world, and the source material for the Atlas is an intrinsic&#13;
part of the Bank's economic data system.&#13;
The assessment of creditworthiness, another of the criteria applied in&#13;
country analyses, requires at a minimum a standard data set on balance of&#13;
payments and on debt.   The Bank relies for balance-of-payments information on the&#13;
International Monetary Fund (IMF), with some other sources added in case of&#13;
incomplete coverage.   Information on debt has been collected throughout the years&#13;
from all countries borrowing from the Bank, and been inserted in the files of the&#13;
Debtor Reporting System (DRS).    The increasing variety of forms of lending and&#13;
the increase in the number of sources of capital have required almost continuous&#13;
improvement and expansion of the system, and more recently the addition of new&#13;
independent systems as wewll, to maintain an adequate coverage of capital flows&#13;
and debt.&#13;
The analysis of the balance of payments and the projection of its main&#13;
constituent parts over future years pose the question of reliable estimates for&#13;
market and price developments for the products which developing countries&#13;
export.  As many of these countries depend on the exports of a few primary commo-&#13;
dities, their market prospects require separate study.    In that context, the need&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
is for projections of absolute prices, which can be transformed into relative, or&#13;
"ireal," prices by deflation with an index representing the general price level&#13;
development  in the world economy.      Further, projections are required of the&#13;
growth of markets and of expected market shares reflecting changes in relative&#13;
competitiveness and possible    supply constraints   in producing countries.     The&#13;
commodity analysis done in the Bank, and the modeling efforts which are described&#13;
below, refect these objectives.&#13;
These inputs are, as said before, essential elements of an analysis of&#13;
creditworthiness.   However, the issues to be studied go well beyond the confines&#13;
of balance-of-payments and debt analysis.    The capability of a country to manage&#13;
its debt and its external accounts is of course closely linked to its capabili-&#13;
ties to manage the domestic economy and, in particular, its fiscal and monetary&#13;
affairs0   Thus, the issues concerning creditworthiness cannot be isolated from&#13;
those which pertain to general economic performance0&#13;
The data requirements for these broader purposes of analysis are very&#13;
substantial, embracing not only national accounts, public sector finance and&#13;
monetary and price statistics, but also a variety of social indicators which are&#13;
suggestive of the level of development and the degree to which various population&#13;
groups benefit from economic progress0     Part of these data are incorporated in&#13;
the standard country analysis0     Standardization is achieved by the centralized&#13;
management and maintenance of core data on the basis of country reporting used&#13;
for greater depth of country analysis by economists assigned to particular&#13;
countries0   The World Tables, 1976 reproduced a major part of the Bank's central&#13;
economic data files, while country economic reports indicate the depth and&#13;
breadth of the country analytical model.&#13;
A set of models is also maintained centrally, and linked directly to the&#13;
standard data0   This enables the efficient production of the various reports and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
tables for which fixed formats exist, and permits the operation of the system at&#13;
low cost but with quality control.      The minimum standard which applies to the&#13;
country data base also applies to the country models: the Bank has been using for&#13;
that purpose a (Revised) Minimum Standard Model (RMSM) which will be discussed in&#13;
more detail later.   The economic situation and prospects of individual developing&#13;
countries has always required an assessment of the international conditions&#13;
expected to prevail and to influence these countries from the outside.      Country&#13;
analysis in the World Bank therefore takes account of the most relevant external&#13;
factors, particularly those related to external trade and capital flows.        The&#13;
increasing complexity of international economic relations necessitated over time&#13;
an increasingly sophisticated approach to the analysis, in order to maintain the&#13;
quality and reliability of the work done on individual developing countries.&#13;
It has been felt for some time that country economic work required a&#13;
better and more embracing analysis of the world economy.       In other words, the&#13;
projections of commodity markets and of probable capital flows to the developing&#13;
countries had to be rooted in an assessment of prospects in the industrial&#13;
countries, which traditionally are the main markets for the exports of developing&#13;
countries and also the main source of international capital flows.      As existing&#13;
organizations - IMF and OECD - do not in the main concern themselves with the&#13;
long-term growth prospects of the industrial countries, the Bank created a small&#13;
unit to work on such projections in coordination with other international&#13;
organizations.&#13;
These were the main elements of the general projections work for the&#13;
Bank's country analysis through 1973.    Although linked to each other in informal&#13;
ways, and gradually evolving towards more integrated analysis, the process was&#13;
far from completed at the time of the oil price increase in 1973. The events of&#13;
that year provided the necessary stimulus for the establishment of an integrated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
analytical  system and also affected     its structure.    For example, developing&#13;
countries were affected differently; for that reason they needed to be shown&#13;
separately.&#13;
The integration of the various elements into one global projection&#13;
system was decided in late 1973.    The sheer magnitude of the task of integration&#13;
made it difficult to create a full-fledged world economy model out of the various&#13;
elements.   Problems arose partly because it was not possible to include all the&#13;
elements fully, as this would have made the system far too large to be&#13;
manageable.    This  is most easily seen when considering the large number of&#13;
developing country models which would need to be integrated and linked to a&#13;
smaller but still substantial number of commodity market models.          Also, the&#13;
international trade and payments segments would become overly tedious and not&#13;
meaningfully related to some of the broader questions to be posed0       For another&#13;
part, there was a lack of analytical models describing essential parts of a&#13;
global system; the industrial economies and trade in manufactured products in&#13;
particular were missing0&#13;
The system that was built initially and was modified and extended in&#13;
each subsequent year cannot be described in terms of a global modeling system0&#13;
There remain significant gaps in its structure, and there are also significant&#13;
overlaps among the constituent parts0     Many of the components are modifications&#13;
of existing models or otherwise deri-ved from those, whereas some others were&#13;
constructed ad hoc to permit the analysis of issues which were of crucial&#13;
importance for the assessment, but not adequately covered by existing models0&#13;
The system had to assist in the analysis of the consequences of the&#13;
international economic events after 1973 on the prospects of the developing&#13;
countries0   Was it possible for those countries to adjust to the new situation,&#13;
and to return to their original growth path? And if so, what policies would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
conducive to that purpose, both by the developing countries themselves and by&#13;
actions of others to help them through the adjustment process?       These were the&#13;
broad questions posed; it was essential to provide the country economists with a&#13;
coherent picture of the effects which could be expected from the outside on their&#13;
countries, in order to obtain their assessment of the problem arising in the&#13;
developing countries themselves, and of the probable policy actions by their&#13;
governments.&#13;
In turn, the summation of the country assessments provided a global&#13;
view, on the basis of which international policies could be tested for their&#13;
degree of effectiveness in assisting the adjustment process.     These international&#13;
policies, particularly concerning trade and capital flows, were the main focus of&#13;
the work in the early exercises.      But over time, with the adjustment process&#13;
proceeding, emphasis gradually shifted to take more account of the developing&#13;
countries- own    policies.    The  flow  of  information   about  their  adjustment&#13;
policies, and the resulting developments, made this increasingly possible.&#13;
The description of the analytical system and its components is a&#13;
snapshot of its shape and operation at one point in time and suffers therefore&#13;
from a lack of perspective over time.    The system grew between 1973 and 1976, and&#13;
it had continued to evolve.    An instant photo of its state at one specific date&#13;
nevertheless sheds light on its scope and structure.     Also, the years which have&#13;
passed since the onset of the recession in industrialized countries permit us to&#13;
look back at the assessments and projections made during those years.&#13;

The focus of the Bank on operational issues and related institutional&#13;
structures leads almost naturally to skepticism about the usefulness of quanti-&#13;
tative models.   It is no doubt more important to understand the decision-making&#13;
processes of a borrowing government and to have a good perception of alternative&#13;
policy options than to worry about the standard errors of some parEmeters of a&#13;
macro-economic modelo   The challenges to the model builders in the Bank were thus&#13;
twofold: in addition to the difficulties of manipulating scarce and sometimes&#13;
unreliable statistics, there was a constant need to build models        hiich were&#13;
relevant to the issues raised from an operational angle. This challenge has been&#13;
very important in shaping the approach talken by those who attempted to construct&#13;
models and has no doubt been instrumental in improving the quality and&#13;
perceptiveness of their analysis0&#13;
Country and commodity market models constructed over the course of the&#13;
years have been of widely divergent kinds and degrees of sophistication0       This&#13;
variety was encouraged to develop models that were relevant to the issues w-yhich&#13;
they were to analyze0    Over time, minimum standard requirements xe*re, however,&#13;
introduced to ensure that each model would have certain minimum capabilities for&#13;
making long-term projections0    At the same time, increasing attention was given&#13;
to the creation of a standardized set of historical data and their linkage to the&#13;
projections.&#13;
The country models often go beyond the minimum standard Tequirsments; in&#13;
recent years a family of models has been developed and tested hich emphasized&#13;
the processes of Employment generation and inccne distribution and w-hich&#13;
contained considerable details of production, trades, and investment0      But even&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
those remain capable of providing a prescribed minimum standard output.       At the&#13;
same time, the need for standard projections in countries for which no elaborate&#13;
models were available at the time caused the formulation of a minimum standard&#13;
model (MSM) and later on a more expanded version, R(evised) MSM.        These models&#13;
were rather simple, almost of an accounting character, but have proved a&#13;
convenient tool of country analysis.     They provide consistency and the flexibi-&#13;
lity to analyze alternative policy options within a limited framework of&#13;
variables.&#13;
No such standardization has been attempted for the commodity market&#13;
models.   First, they are more recent, and therefore still at early stages of&#13;
development.   The striking differences in the structure of individual commodity&#13;
markets also make standardization difficult. The desirability of standardization&#13;
is therefore less than for the country models, although some standardization of&#13;
the projection outputs was needed for the linkage in the global framework.&#13;
We will describe only the revised minimum standard model.     This is to be&#13;
taken as representing minimum modeling requirements, assuring a standard and&#13;
consistent approach between countries.     Much more elaborate country models have&#13;
been built in some instances for operational purposes, and there have been many&#13;
extensions  and elaborations   of the RMSM model;     such projection results have&#13;
always been included in the standard outputs in preference to the simple RMSM&#13;
outputs.&#13;
The RMSM simulation model distinguishes three production sectors:&#13;
industry, agriculture, and other sectors.      For each of these, exogenous growth&#13;
rates are provided for the initial model run; as.will be shown further, there is&#13;
an option for obtaining alternative growth patterns which take the balance of&#13;
payments as the starting point.     Usually, the initial values are calibrated to&#13;
the countries' planned targets or to historical rates, or to other judgments by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 &#13;
country economists.    The country economist who builds the model uses historical&#13;
series  for additional   guidance.    It is of course also possible      to develop&#13;
functional relationships between sector growth rates, as long as either the&#13;
growth rate of GDP or of one of the sectors is provided as an exogenous value. A&#13;
computer program handles the required simultaneous solution0&#13;
The sectoral decomposition has the advantage that the implications of&#13;
specific GDP growth assumptions are brought out more clearly, and may be easily&#13;
compared with the past performance of the country0         It also permits a more&#13;
diversified analysis of trade flows and of compatibility of growth with invest-&#13;
ment activity.   The RMSM specifies several of such relations, but allows numerous&#13;
variations and extensions if these seem practicable and useful0&#13;
Changes of stocks - a small but volatile element - are shown separately&#13;
to permit the estimation of the investment equations in terms of fixed investment&#13;
only0   Stock changes are related in RMSM to the growth of GDP; although past&#13;
fluctuations make it rather unlikely that a good relationship can be established,&#13;
a simple average for several years of the past may suffice.         Sometimes large&#13;
stock changes may be expected for specific reasons and in those cases the country&#13;
economist can put in specific values for the first projection years before&#13;
reverting back to the standard equation0     This is of considerable importance if&#13;
these stock changes relate to internationally traded goods0&#13;
Investment in fixed assets is related to the growth of sectoral output&#13;
through incremental capital-output ratios (ICOR's).     A constant term is added to&#13;
the equation, representing investment expenditures which cannot be related to the&#13;
growth of output, particularly in some social sectors but also in those cases&#13;
where gestation periods extend very far in the future (erosion control,&#13;
reforestation)0    The investment equation is quite unsophis.icated      and cannot&#13;
claim to represent advanced methods for dealing with the process of economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
accumulation.     It hardly   needs  saying  that,  with  very   few exceptions,   the&#13;
available data for developing countries do not permit anything beyond this simple&#13;
form.   Frequently, data do not even provide the basis for estimating capital&#13;
coefficients by sectors for historical years.      In that case, the RMSM framework&#13;
suggests an even simpler approach which relates total fixed investment to both&#13;
the level and the growth of the GDP, plus a constant term as above.       The link to&#13;
the GDP-level serves the purpose of separating out replacement and infrastructure&#13;
investments.&#13;
Probably the least satisfactory element is the absence of realistic&#13;
gestation  lags   in  the  investment  equation.    The   standard  time  lag between&#13;
investment (during a year) and the growth of output (from this year to the next)&#13;
is  half  a   year,  implying   an  average  investment   period  from  inception   to&#13;
completion of only one year.      This may not be too far off the mark for some&#13;
traditional on-farm investment, the acquisition of agricultural machinery or&#13;
transport equipment, but it is clearly inadequate as a description of industrial&#13;
investment and even more so for most infrastructure.      Some of the more elaborate&#13;
models for countries with a more advanced statistical system do include a variety&#13;
of gestation periods, related to each sector. It would appear desirable that in&#13;
the future such lags should be used more widely.&#13;
Imports of goods and non-factor services are divided into six classes&#13;
according   to  typical  end-uses,   and  related  to  the  most  appropriate   demand&#13;
category.    Capital goods imports are linked to fixed investment; intermediate&#13;
goods to value added in industry; food and other consumer goods imports to&#13;
consumption: fuels and non-factor services are related to the total GDP.        Again,&#13;
these relations are not required for the RMSM; other equations or systems can&#13;
replace the ones suggested if deemed necessary, and more detailed import demand&#13;
systems can be accommodated.     The import elasticities are usually obtained from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14 &#13;
the historical series, but can be modified if specific reasons are given.         A&#13;
deviation from the standard system which is used regularly pertains to food&#13;
imports: if domestic agricultural production is subject to considerable year-to--&#13;
year fluctuations, it may be desirable to inc2ude the latter as a variable wPhicn&#13;
influences food imports.&#13;
Exports of goods and non-factor services are also specified by ccmmodity&#13;
groups and classes.   The main primary export products are shown separately, and&#13;
linked with the commodity market projections made elsewhere in the Bank.         If&#13;
these commodities are a significant part of the country's total agricultural&#13;
output, the RMSM sometimes specifies the export-oriented sector separately in the&#13;
breakdown of the GDP.&#13;
Trade  prices   follou  partly  from  coemmodity  market analysis,   trade&#13;
analysis, and   the  inflation  projection  made  in  the global   system.    Price&#13;
guidelines provided to the country economists pertain to projections of prices&#13;
that are quotations for standard grades in international markets0       The country&#13;
analysis uses border prices (exports f.o.b. and imports coif£) applicable for&#13;
the goods actually shipped0     Their relationshilps differ betueen countries and&#13;
commodities and are characterized by irregular lags and leads, and thus require&#13;
careful interpretation by the country economist0&#13;
The model described above estimates the imports required to achieve a&#13;
given rate of growth but treats export earnings as exogenous0     T.he resource gap&#13;
(the difference between imports and exports of goods and noni-actor services)&#13;
reflects the excess of these imports over foreign exchange earned from exports0&#13;
It represents the amount of external resources required to meet tre growth target&#13;
set,  and  the   model  with  exogenous  gro-th  rates   is  therefore  called  the&#13;
"requirements version" of the RMSMo&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
But other options are available.       For example,   the version described&#13;
above estimates savings as the difference between investment expenditures and&#13;
external resources, an amount which may exceed some preconceived notion of the&#13;
feasible  level   and  rate  of  savings.     In  that  case  the  RMSM   permits  the&#13;
introduction of an upper or lower constraint on savings.         Ex ante savings are&#13;
corrected through adjustment of the import level, i.e., investment and exports&#13;
are assumed to be unresponsive to shortfalls.      A choice must be made concerning&#13;
the category of imports that must bear the adjustment.        Commonly, the non-food&#13;
consumer goods are selected for that purpose, as this is thought to have the best&#13;
impact on sectoral production and also corresponds to the experience in many&#13;
countries where these consumer imports constitute the most volatile element of&#13;
imports. These goods are also most likely to be the subject of policy action in&#13;
case of balance-of-payments constraints.&#13;
It is also possible to start the operation of the RMSM from a&#13;
predetermined   amount  of  available  external   resources.    This  "availabilities&#13;
version," like the version with constrained savings, requires backward iteration&#13;
to arrive at an estimate of possible growth of the GDP and/or some arbitrary&#13;
allocation decisions. The important feature, however, is that the structure of&#13;
the RMSM provides a flexibility which permits the country economist to work from&#13;
several sets of assumptions and exogenous values and to use the model in a&#13;
variety of directions. Judicious use of the model provides not only the required&#13;
set of projections, but also a better perception of the main interrelationships&#13;
within the economy.&#13;
To ease the testing of model runs, the RMSM program calculates and&#13;
prints a number of ratios and other economic indicators from the basic data, both&#13;
for  the  historical   and  the  projected   years.    These  permit,  through   quick&#13;
scanning, an overview of the main changes which occur over the past and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
projection years, and this permits discontinuities or other unexplained phenomena&#13;
which either need justification or revision to be spotted.&#13;
The RMSM also contains a number of mainly derived variables like&#13;
government consumption, tax receipts, indirect taxes net of subsidies, and some&#13;
minor balance-of-payments items.    A large fraction of the equations concerns the&#13;
capital account of the balance of payments. The projected capital flows detailed&#13;
by sources and by terms of borrowing permit the calculation of debt service&#13;
liabilities0   These are then added to the known obligations which stem from debt&#13;
contracted in the past0     This elaborate detail of the capital account is the&#13;
basic source for creditworthiness analysis and is also used in the formulation of&#13;
the Bank's own lending activities0&#13;
A summary of the RMSM equations is given at the end of tnis chapter, in&#13;
Annex IIl.&#13;
This approach has several advantages, especially if an increasing part&#13;
of the data and the models can be stored and accessed on the computer files0&#13;
Direct links between the various data files and the models permit quick and&#13;
regular updating of estimates and projections so that the country files are kept&#13;
current0   A number of standard tables for use in reports and for management&#13;
information  can   be  produced  with   little  effort  and  a  miniLmum  of  manual&#13;
interference.&#13;
The system provides comparability between countries0     Tnis is important&#13;
for comparative country analysis and for a systematic approach to international&#13;
policy issues0   The possibility of aggregating past and projected data by groups&#13;
of countries was found to be of great value in the initial formulation of the&#13;
global framework0&#13;
Over the years, a large number of minimum standard models was produced,&#13;
in addition to a series of more complex country models0          In total, some 75&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
developing country models have been built at one time or another.    Many of these&#13;
are no longer operational, often because they were replaced by improved versions,&#13;
so that the number of countries for which models exist at any time is about 45.&#13;
The larger models particularly have proved hard to maintain.       They are often&#13;
based on specially constructed data sets which deviate from standard concepts, so&#13;
that their maintenance demands large amoun-s of staff time, and sometimes even&#13;
travel  to  the  country- concerned.    Because  the  RMSM  models are   based  on&#13;
standardized and regularly updated data available in computer readable form, they&#13;
can be updated regularly.     A set of 45 country models for so called "sample&#13;
panel" countries was thus updated annually as a basis for the global analysis.&#13;
It constituted the link between the projections for the developing countries&#13;
which are made regularly for internal use, and the global projections which are&#13;
the subject of this discussion.       The selection of these countries and the&#13;
resulting composition of the sample of countries will be discussed in Chapter V.&#13;
Because of the key role of the country projections in the 1973-76 global&#13;
system, their critical parameters for countries or country groups have been&#13;
compared  for historical and    projected  periods.    For example, optimism    in&#13;
projecting the balance of payments tended to be reflected in relatively high&#13;
projected rates of growth of exports and relatively low - as compared to the&#13;
past - import elasticities in relation to the national product.       In the table&#13;
below such comparisons are made for broad groups of countries between the periods&#13;
1967-73 and 1975-85, on the basis of the materials used in the 1976 global&#13;
analyses.&#13;

domestic resource mobilization efforts, and of the efficiency of their use, notably&#13;
marginal savings rates and incremental capital/output ratios. On the basis of the&#13;

The table suggests that care was taken not to overstate the expected&#13;
performance of the countries which did well in the past, whereas for countries&#13;
with a rather weak historical performance, the assumption made implied signifi-&#13;
cant policy improvements.    The latter characteristic is demonstrated for all of&#13;
the lower-income countries, but also for the slower growing countries of Latin&#13;
America.   An element of optimism could be read in the substantial decline of the&#13;
import elasticities in the fast growing countries of East Asia and of Latin&#13;
America; it should be observed, however, that these countries were able to expand&#13;
their imports very rapidly until 1973 with their rapid export growth.          Some&#13;
decline of import elasticities was therefore to be expected in the future.      And&#13;
similar arguments applied to a somewhat lesser extent to the countries of the&#13;
Middle East and in Southern Europe.&#13;
Again it appears that the presumption of improved performance is&#13;
implicit in the projections for the lower-income countries and also in those for&#13;
the slower growing Latin American countries.       Other wise, it seems that the&#13;
projections are not out of line with historical experience; in some cases where a&#13;
very  good  performance was observed    for the past, -the projections do imply&#13;
somewhat less favorable capital output and marginal savings ratios.       This may&#13;
partly be the result of some conservatism on the part of the country experts, but&#13;
for another part it does, of course, reflect the more difficult circumstances&#13;
under which many of these countries must implement their policies.     Particularly&#13;
the slower growth of the industrial countries as compared to the past and the&#13;
heavier debt service burden to be carried in the years ahead may have an impact&#13;
on  their  future performance.    Such issues are    presented in the last three&#13;
chapters of this book.&#13;

Commodity Price and Quantity Forecasts&#13;
The Bank's interest in the market developments of primary commodities&#13;
dates from the 1950s and 1960s, when they accounted for the bulk of developing&#13;
country exports.    Prices and levels of demand for primary commodities        still&#13;
affect the growth prospects and creditworthiness of developing countries,&#13;
particularly of the small and least developed ones.         Thus analysis of these&#13;
market development prospects has been an essential ingredient of the Bank's&#13;
country-economic work.&#13;
A second dimension to this work was provided by the requirements of&#13;
projects analysis, particularly for loans for primary commodity production,&#13;
processing, and trade. Projected commodity price developments were an element in&#13;
the assessment of the costs and benefits of these projectso     Finally, the Bank's&#13;
commodity market analysis was found to be useful for the appraisal of such broad&#13;
issues of international economic policies as the stabilization of commodity&#13;
prices and export earnings, the effects of trade restrictions or their libera-&#13;
lization, and the proposals for supply control0&#13;
Market analysis is accordingly undertaken for the medium- to long-term&#13;
projection horizon, extending from five to ten years.     Short-terin fluctuations -&#13;
however important those may be - are accounted for in the analysis but not&#13;
projected0    The projections attempt to estimate relative long-run equilibrium&#13;
prices that take into account long-run marginal costs. This requires a good deal&#13;
of information on the determinants of supply in the various producing countries,&#13;
sometimes  including  similar information on synthetic substitutes0       It hardly&#13;
needs saying that knowledge in this area is limited, not very reliable if&#13;
available, and subject to continuous changeo      Thus notwithstanding considerable&#13;
efforts, there is still a long way to go before this type of analysis can be&#13;
considered firmly based on fact and on adequate understanding of market behavior.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
The projections also need to be related to a set of broader projections&#13;
concerning  growth of the world economy.       Before the Bank began its global&#13;
analysis, in the years before 1973, that framework did not exist and most&#13;
projections of commodity markets were based on trend extrapolations of economic&#13;
growth and industrial production in the industrial countries.&#13;
Inflation in those countries was sometimes ignored and in others&#13;
extrapolated from past trends.    Clearly, by 1973 it was no longer realistic to&#13;
abstract from the possibility of major deviations from those trends.      Nor could&#13;
the analysis ignore the role commodity prices themselves co'uld play in generating&#13;
general price developments in the world economy.       Thus,  the global framework&#13;
became essential for a credible continuation of commodity market analysis.&#13;
As described below, the SIMLINK model included a number of simple&#13;
commodity market models which permitted the full integration of commodity&#13;
analysis into the broader framework.     But this should not be interpreted as an&#13;
indication that the Bank's commodity analysis was entirely integrated with the&#13;
global analysis.   The system used for the global projections was not always seen&#13;
by the commodity economists as an adequate instrument for their projections, and&#13;
the SIMLINK commodity models were as only one ingredient in a rather eclectic&#13;
approach  to projections.    The commodity analysts' detailed knowledge of the&#13;
factors which influence commodity markets and their - factual or intuitive -&#13;
asssessments of supply conditions in the major producing countries led them from&#13;
time to time to modify or even reject the SIMLINK results.&#13;
Part of the problem was of course that most of the SIMLINK commodity&#13;
models were by their nature suitable only for short-run forecasts, whereas the&#13;
need was for forecasts extending 5-10 years in the future and describing long-run&#13;
equilibrium.   The latter required, among other things, an understanding of the&#13;
mechanisms  behind investment decisions concerning     primary commodities.    That&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
segment is absent in most of the models presently being used0 Aloo, the issue of&#13;
commodity price sensitivity to general inflation in the u3rld economy has&#13;
remained thorny, although it strongly affected the analysis0/2&#13;

THE ANALYSIS OF CAPITAL FLOOWS AND DEBT&#13;
The transmission of economic impulses between countrieo takes place&#13;
through the movement of goods and services and flows of capital.     The particular&#13;
significance of capital flous for the developing countries arise from the fact&#13;
that the transfer of resources from the richer to the poorer countries is part of&#13;
them.  The World Bank, as an intermediary for part of these flous, has a special&#13;
interest in their level and composition.&#13;
The General Framework&#13;
Information on the flows of capital was obtained from each cauntry's&#13;
balance of payments.   Their standardization by the IfF increasingly permitted the&#13;
use of these data for analytical purposes.       However, balance-of-payments data&#13;
provided information only on    flows taking place uithin a particular period,&#13;
usually a year.    It did not say on what conditions of interest and repayment&#13;
these capital flows were contracted, and to What extent the flow in any given&#13;
year resulted from commitments in earlier years0    Nor did it provide information&#13;
on the sources of capital, both by countries of origin and by types of&#13;
institutions  in   these  countries.    Information   on  terms  is  essential  for&#13;
determining the future liabilities of interest and arortization; a clasGification&#13;
by sources is needed for the analysis of the supply of capital and its future&#13;
development.&#13;
Several more detailed information sources were available, but could not&#13;
easily be used in conjunction with the fL4F balance of payments (or with each&#13;
other) as country coverages differed, definitions and classificztions of capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
flows were not the same, and significant capital movements to developing&#13;
countries were not or were inadequately covered for their joint use.&#13;
The linkage of the various available data sources gradually progressed&#13;
over time.   The earlier attempts to cover and classify all capital flows were&#13;
crude and consistent only at a rather high level of aggregation.     Additional and&#13;
new data collection systems had to be devised and implemented to permit capital&#13;
flow presentations of reasonable quality and reliability. It became possible to&#13;
estimate with some reliability the debt implications of current borrowing by the&#13;
developing countries, and thus to improve the analysis and projections of credit-&#13;
worthiness of these countries.&#13;
Projections of capital flows require a concise presentation of the&#13;
sources of capital, by types, as well as a compehensive description of the&#13;
inflows for each recipient country.    Flows need to be consistent between origins&#13;
and destinations, in order to translate constrained supplies - for example, of&#13;
concessional capital - into constrained receipts of the developing countries&#13;
affected by such limitation.    Similarly, the demand for capital which developing&#13;
countries can exercise reasonably and within the limits of their creditworthiness&#13;
must be translated towards their potential sources and compared with the availa-&#13;
bility of capital in relevant markets.    These requirements make heavy demands on&#13;
available statistics and cannot yet be met fully.       In what follows, the main&#13;
sources  and  their uses   and  linkages  will  be  discussed,  together with the&#13;
remaining weaknesses and shortcomings of the methods and the resulting estimates.&#13;
Balance-of-Payments Data&#13;
Standardized balances of payments were available for 88 developing&#13;
countries and constituted the basic source of information on capital flows to&#13;
these countries.   These data are regularly published by the IMF in its Balance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Payments Yearbook.   They had to be expanded to full geographic coverage of al,&#13;
developing countries to link capital receipts to capital supply by sources. Such&#13;
additional estimates for countries not covered in the IMF Balances of Payments&#13;
were, by necessity,    less reliable.    Fortunately, these additional    estimates&#13;
concerned countries with relatively minor trade and capital flowus.       Thus, the&#13;
totals for all developing countries together reQained rather close to the TIMF&#13;
data on the 88 countries.&#13;
The sources and methods used for these estimates are        summarized In&#13;
Table 3.    The first column contains the 88 countries In the IMF balance of&#13;
payments  data  file;  the  reason  for changes   under  the item   "net long-terLa&#13;
borrowing" of the standardized balance of payments will be discussad separately.&#13;
The main sources of data for countries outside the CFY's standardized&#13;
system of balances of payments are:&#13;
(a) Data from the IMF publication International Financial Statistics (TFS)&#13;
concerning imports and exports, changes in reserves, and the use of fLF&#13;
credit;&#13;
(b) Data from the IMF/IBRD publication Direction of International Trade&#13;
concerning imports and exports, where these are not available from the&#13;
IFS;&#13;
(c) Data from the OECD/DAC publication The Geographic Distribution of&#13;
Financial Flows to Developing Countries concerning flows of grants and&#13;
loans, as well as direct foreign investment;&#13;
(d) Data from the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS).&#13;
Obviously, the easiest part to estimate in the balance-of-payrents&#13;
format mes the trade balance:     IFS data mere preferred, with those frcM the&#13;
Directiot of Trade (DOT) as a second substitute0      No estimate could be made of&#13;
non-factor  services,   which  were  therefore  assumed  to  be  zero   (net). IFS&#13;

information concerning changes in reserves and the use of IMF credit, together&#13;
with Development Assistance Committee (DAC) data on capital flous, permitted the&#13;
construction of a fairly complete capital and reserves account0     In some cases,&#13;
there were capital flow data from the World Bank's own Debtor Reporting System&#13;
(DRS) which were then used in preference over DAC data0   Wet factor services t'ere&#13;
assumed to consist mainly of interest payments and were therefore estimated on&#13;
the basis of total liabilities as reported in the DAC statistics0 Any difference&#13;
between the estimated current account balance on the one hand, and the capital&#13;
and reserve account on the other, was tzeated as a residual and shown as net&#13;
transfers.&#13;
Table 4 presents the aggregate balance of payments for all nonroill&#13;
exporting  developing  countries  obtained  in  this  way0    A  similar table is&#13;
available for the oil-exporting developing countries./3 For easy reference, the&#13;
table shows some detail of the capital flow0o&#13;
The World Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS)&#13;
The DRS is considered to be the best available source of data on public&#13;
and   publicly   guaranteed  medium-   and   long-term   borrowing  by   developing&#13;
countries.   It contains loan-specific information and its integration in the&#13;
balance-of-payments framework is therefore most desirable0 Compatibility between&#13;
the IMF and IBRD records of foreign borrouing by developing countries is, howg&#13;
ever, only true by assumption0    That assumption is (as should be in principle)&#13;
that each flow reported by the DRS has Its counterpart in the IMF balance of&#13;
payments0   Flows reported by the IMF in excess of DRS data should thus be non-&#13;
guaranteed capital0 When a detailed compaTison was possible, It appeared that&#13;

the compatibility assumption was plausible.   But in some cases problems do arise,&#13;
as the residual difference which should reflect non-guaranteed prlvate borrowing&#13;
does not always give estimates which are corroborated by other and independent&#13;
estimates of such flous0   Therefore, the line "other medium- and lozg-term loans"&#13;
in the table (which represents the non-guaranteed private capita-) needs to be&#13;
handled with care and to be compared to other available information before being&#13;
relied upon.    As this line was obtained as a residual, it absorbed whatever&#13;
inconsistencies existed between DRS and balance-of-payments data.&#13;
Capital Flow Components&#13;
The first distinction made, along the lines of the YNI'&lt;s balance-of-&#13;
payments concepts, was among direct foreign investments, grants, medium- and&#13;
long-term borrowing, and short-term capital.    The numbers used for each of these&#13;
main categories were those from the consolldated balance-of-payments described&#13;
above0 Some observations on each of these components may be made here.&#13;
Grants were not reported adequately by recipient countries, largely for&#13;
administrative reasons.   Much higher totals reported by the DAC-donors were not&#13;
useful  for  a  number   of  conceptual  reasons0    Short-term borrowing   largely&#13;
represents trade credits and has therefore been growI-yng witn the increase in&#13;
developing country trade0   Links between this type of credit and borrowing with&#13;
longer maturities were established sometimes, when countries rolled over short-&#13;
term credit as a substitute for longer-term borrow^ing0   Other countries increased&#13;
their medium- and long-term debt through the consolidation of short-term liabili-&#13;
ties. For such reasons short-term debt needs to be taken into account from time&#13;
to time in the case of particular countries0&#13;
Direct foreign investment is not always recorded well in balances-of-&#13;
payments  of developing   countries;  the different modes of financing      prIvate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
enterprise by foreign companies are not always known to the recording authority&#13;
and can give rise to significant errors.        The data available from the DAC,&#13;
collected from the countries of origin, are not very useful in this context as&#13;
they contain a large flow which has no specified destination.&#13;
The medium- and long-term borrowings as shown in the balance-of-payments&#13;
were accepted in total, but were broken down further, using the more detailed&#13;
data from the World Bank DRS which contains full information on sources, terms,&#13;
and purposes.    As the DRS contains only lending to the public sector in the&#13;
reporting countries, or to their agencies, or lending for which the recipient&#13;
country government has provided a guarantee, there was a residual of medium- and&#13;
long-term borrowing which was assumed to go to the recipient country's private&#13;
sector without a guarantee from that country's government.     It was also assumed&#13;
that those flows (if not all) originated in the private sector of the creditor&#13;
countries (through all or part of these may carry a guarantee from the creditor&#13;
country government).   The borderline between such private-to-private lending and&#13;
private foreign direct investment was not always clear and accounts for some of&#13;
the estimation problems for the latter.&#13;
As already indicated, the procedure followed in breaking down medium-&#13;
and long-term capital flows assumed compatibility of IMF and World Bank data.&#13;
Inconsistencies which may in fact exist were absorbed in the item "Other Medium-&#13;
and Long-Term Loans (net)" which therefore was not always regarded as a reliable&#13;
estimate of non-guaranteed private capital flows.&#13;
Links to Other Data Systems&#13;
The preceding paragraphs described the method used to obtain a presen-&#13;
tation of the capital account of the balance-of-payments for all developing&#13;
countries together and for groups of those countries.    The results, presented in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Table 4, were comprehensive in a geographic sense, but specified capital flows&#13;
only by very broad categories.      The reliability of each ccmponent differedo&#13;
Above all, these data by themselves could provide answers to the main questions&#13;
raised in the context of the global analysis:&#13;
(a) The sources of these flows needed to be identified, in sufficient&#13;
detail, to permit the analysis of the criteria and conditions which&#13;
governed their size and composition;&#13;
(b)  The flows needed to be linked to components of ccmmtment, disbursement&#13;
and terms (amortization and interest mainly) to permit the analysis of&#13;
external debt and debt service.&#13;
The balance-of-payments should constitute the frEmewort for these Bore&#13;
detailed studies, but cannot by itself provide the necessary information.       The&#13;
additional information needed does not exist in a format which is suitable foz&#13;
both purposes.   Data with a useful specification of capital flows by sources are&#13;
available for the major sources in a classification made by (and for the use of)&#13;
the DAC of the OECDO     But data which relate capital flows to individual loan&#13;
transactions and their terms are available mainly from recipient country sources&#13;
and follow a quite different classification0&#13;
The problem is not limited to incompatible sets of data frcm different&#13;
sources, as neither of the two issues to be analyzed can be approached&#13;
exclusively on the basis of one data source0 Each of the sources is lnccmplete,&#13;
both in terms of geographic coverage and with respect to the flows coverecd0&#13;
Therefore, each one of the issues requires the fullest possible use of all&#13;
sources together, notwithstanding the incompatibility of the classifications0     A&#13;
discussion of the methods used and the Tesulting estimates is therefore&#13;
unavoidably tedious and sometimes confusing0       The discussion will proceed by&#13;
taking the two issues seriatim but with a forewarning to the reader concerning&#13;
the necessity to cross-reference bet^Jeen the two0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
The Sources of Capital Flows&#13;
The concepts of financial flows presented below were first introduced by&#13;
the OECD's Development Assistance Committee/4 for its own members' capital&#13;
transactions with developing countries. These concepts were currently applied to&#13;
other donors as well: members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting&#13;
Countries   (OPEC),  the  centrally   planned  economies  (CPE),   and  multilateral&#13;
agencies.   Financial flows from developing countries other than OPEC and CPE to&#13;
other developing countries were usually excluded from the statistics.&#13;
Types of Flows&#13;
Three major types of flows are defined by the DAC as follows:&#13;
(a)  Official  Development   Assistance  (ODA),   defined  as  those   flows  to&#13;
developing countries provided by official agencies; to the extent that&#13;
these transactions meet the following tests: (i) they are administered&#13;
with the objective to promote the economic development and welfare of&#13;
developing countries; (ii) they are concessional with a grant element/5&#13;
of at least 25 percent.&#13;
ODA consists of grants and official development lending.      Official&#13;
flows to multilateral agencies in the form of capital subscriptions,&#13;
contributions, and concessional lending are also classified as ODA.&#13;
/4  Members  of   the  OECD  Development  Assistance   Committee  are:    Australia,&#13;
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, the Federal Republic of&#13;
Germany,   Italy,  Japan,  the   Netherlands,  New   Zealand,  Norway,   Sweden,&#13;
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Commission of the&#13;
European Economic Communities (EEC). The statistics exclude EEC as a donor.&#13;
/5  The grant element is the grant equivalent as a percentage of the face value&#13;
of a financial commitment; the grant equivalent is defined as the difference&#13;
between the face value of a financial commitment and the discounted present&#13;
value of the required amortization and interest payments using a 10 percent&#13;
discount rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 &#13;
Flows from multilateral agencies to developing countzries are also&#13;
subjected to the above tests./6&#13;
(b)  Other Official Flows (OOF) are those transactions which are not con-,&#13;
cessional or which, even though they are concessional, are primarily&#13;
trade-facilitating in character.   OOF includes official excport credits,&#13;
other long-term capital such as equity investments, and a small amount&#13;
of grants which is not for development purposes. The net acquisition by&#13;
governments and central monetary institutions of securities issued by&#13;
multilateral agencies at marlket tezms is also classified by the DAC as&#13;
OOF; however, such transactions uere excluded aa the acrjuisition itself&#13;
did not constitute a flow to developing countries.&#13;
(c) Private Flows cover changes in private long-term assets, both bilateral&#13;
and multilateral, of non-monetary and monetary sectors.     Private floes&#13;
include direct investments, other net private capital flows, guaranteed&#13;
private  export  credits   to  the developing   countries,  and  portfolio&#13;
investment in developing countries and in multilateral agencies.       The&#13;
DAC countries are the primary source of private flc7Js to developing&#13;
countries0   Another type of private flow is international bank lending,&#13;
in the form of Eurocurrency credits0      These are not part of the DAC&#13;
reports and are treated separately hereo&#13;
/6  The DAC treated all flows from multilateral agencies for development purposes&#13;
as ODA before 1974.    Starting with 1974, most multilateral loans made wiAth&#13;
ordinary funds ('hard' or conventional loans) w^-ere classified as OOFo    Only&#13;
grants and loans made with special funds ('soft' loans) have since then been&#13;
classified as ODA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Major Donors&#13;
The following are the major donors or sources of financial flows to&#13;
developing countries and to multilateral agencies.&#13;
(a) DAC: includes the 17 member countries listed in footnote 4 on page 27.&#13;
Before 1974, Portugal was a member.    Up to 1974, Portugal's data were&#13;
included in the statistics.&#13;
(b) OPEC:    refers primarily to 10 countries within OPEC, of which Saudi&#13;
Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar are major donors.&#13;
Others are Algeria, Iran, Ira4, Libya, Nigeria, and Venezuela./7&#13;
(c)  CPE:   the USSR, Eastern European countries (i.e., Bulgaria, Czechoslo-&#13;
vakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania), and the People's&#13;
Republic of China.   Although about 90 percent of CPE flows are known to&#13;
be grants or concessional loans, they were treated as OOF because of&#13;
lack of comprehensive and reliable data. Allocation of CPE flows was at&#13;
best crude.&#13;
(d) Multilateral Agencies:     the traditional multilateral agencies include&#13;
the World Bank Group, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian&#13;
Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Development&#13;
Fund, the European Investment Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank, and&#13;
several UN agencies; the new OPEC multilateral 'agencies, established&#13;
between 1974 and 1976, include the Arab Fund for Economic and Social&#13;
Development (AFESD), the Special Account of the Organization of Arab&#13;
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), and the Special Arab Fund for&#13;
Africa (SAFA).&#13;
/7 Other OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, and Indonesia.&#13;

Developing Countries as Groups of Recipients&#13;
Since the coverage of developing countries in the global frameLDrk&#13;
"universe" was more restricted than in the DAC dataD      for analytical purposes,&#13;
more groupings were included than the original four incoms grEOups and oil-&#13;
exporting countries.&#13;
The following definitions indicate the data coverage and allocation:&#13;
Lower-income countries    World Bank&#13;
non-oil   -&#13;
Middle-income countrie    developing&#13;
countries      W ^orld Bank,,&#13;

To multilateral agencies                         I                       Total&#13;
All flows presented, unless specifled otherwise, ware net flcus, i.e.,&#13;
gross disbursements minus amortization.    The net flow concept Ls&amp; generally used&#13;
because the gross flow and amortization data uere less complete than net flow&#13;
data.  The net flow data also corresponded to the balance-of-paymsnts informtion&#13;
about capital flows0&#13;
The structure of financial flows has changed drastically during the past&#13;
decade, and especially since 1973.    The members of OPEC became mEjor sources of&#13;
capital, through bilateral and multilateral channels0     Flws originating in the&#13;
private  sector  increased considerably;   official  flows  frem the DAC and CPE&#13;
/8  OPEC members plus Bahrain, Brunei, Oman, Trinidad and Tobago.&#13;
/9 More advanced countries: Cyprus, Gibraltar, Greece, Halts, Portugal, SaE'1n,&#13;
and  Israel.    Others  n.i.e.:  all  others not   included  clsehnere, mostly&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
countries increased at a slower pace than the other components. Table 5 presents&#13;
the flows and the changes during 1970-75 as reflected in the records of the&#13;
donors and their institutions.&#13;
It should be noted that the total (net) flows presented exceed the&#13;
totals from recipient country data as recorded in Table 4 by a significant&#13;
margin. These differences are the subject of much that follows.&#13;
The table attempts to take account of the flows to and from multilateral&#13;
agencies, in order to build a bridge between the statistics on capital flows by&#13;
origin and the amounts which pass through to the developing countries. It should&#13;
be noted that the amounts do not differ greatly, but their composition changes in&#13;
the process of passing though the multilateral agencies.&#13;
Adjustment to Donor Data&#13;
Differences which are observed between the capital flows from donor&#13;
sources (Table 5) and received by developing countries (Table 4) arise for a&#13;
number of reasons, quite apart from statistical discrepancies.          Some of the&#13;
differences can be attributed to specific factors such as geographical coverage,&#13;
or classification of flows, but not all of the differences can be given exact&#13;
statistical quantification.     The adjustments presented below, which intend to&#13;
bring the donor data in closer harmony with the flows recorded by the developing&#13;
countries, are therefore not based in all instances on exact measurement and in&#13;
some cases are even rather crude.       Table 6 summarizes    the adjustments.    It&#13;
presents only the summary of the adjustments.       They were made, for each donor&#13;
country or agency separately, and by detailed categories of capital flows.&#13;
The largest adjustment is for technical assistance grants.       This flow&#13;
generally constitutes a much smaller amount in the balance-of-payments accounts&#13;
of the recipient countries than in the values shown in DAC statistics.           The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 &#13;
destination of technical assistance flows was often not known, but even when the&#13;
recipient country was clearly identified, it was seldcm possible for t,he&#13;
recipient country's balance-of-payments statistician to record the value of the&#13;
technical assistance received.    To do so would have involved difficult problais&#13;
in the valuation of services, of costs which recipient countries often bore,&#13;
whether demestic (housing and subsistence) or foreign exchange (automotive&#13;
transport).    Furthermore, many of the transactions involved, such as salary&#13;
payments to donor country nationals paid in the donor country, were entirely&#13;
outside the recipients' borders.     For that reason this component w^as omitted,&#13;
without prejudicing the real value of those fLCW8s, but in ozder to achieve&#13;
consistency which was essential for the projections.&#13;
Three other types of adjustments were made to donor records of official&#13;
flows  to  developing  countries.     First,  some  flows  ware  not  allocated  to&#13;
individual countries in donor country records but reported in regional or global&#13;
summary figures. Since all flows in the global summary had to be related to the&#13;
overall financing of current deficits of individual countries, these unidentified&#13;
flows were excluded.     This adjustment wa-s rather small0      Sccondly, the DAC&#13;
figures included flows to a few developing countries that were not included in&#13;
the global framework such as Cuba and North Vietnam.&#13;
The third adjustment was related to the composition of the universe of&#13;
developing countries.   In 1976, several countries on the DAC list of recipient&#13;
developing countries were excluded because of their relatively advanced economic&#13;
status0 These were: Greece, Iceland, Israel, Malta, Portugal, and Spain.&#13;
The adjustments to private source flous applied mainly to direct&#13;
investment.    A considerable portion of investment by transnational      petroleum&#13;
companies based in the developed countries could not be allocated to individual&#13;
recipient countries and was therefore omitted0&#13;

Comparison of Estimates&#13;
Before a comparison of estimates could be made between the records of&#13;
donors and recipients, a last step had to be taken to adjust for differences in&#13;
geography.   Donor records, as adjusted above in Tables 5 and 6, pertain to all&#13;
developing countries; a comparison with the consolidated balance of payments of&#13;
the recipient countries in Table 4 requires a distinction to be drawn between&#13;
oil-exporting and non-oil-exporting developing countries.       For example, in 1974&#13;
out  of   $15.66  billion  official   net  capital -flows   to  specified  developing&#13;
countries, ($1.35) billion was received by oil-exporting countries, leaving a&#13;
total of $12.56 for non-oil developing countries.&#13;
This estimate from donors' records is compared in Table 7 below, with&#13;
the flows recorded by recipients.     The latter is taken as firm information, and&#13;
the data from donors' records are adjusted to those, as represented by the&#13;
residual, or adjustment, item in line 6 of Table 7.      It should be noted that, in&#13;
line 4, part of the flows recorded by recipients as public loans from private&#13;
sources are recorded by the donors as private flows.       The same will be the case&#13;
for the "other" loans (line 5, the difference between IMF balance-of-payments&#13;
data and the public capital flows recorded by the DRS), as those are flows&#13;
without public guarantee by the recipient and therefore are most likely to be&#13;
from private sources.&#13;
The efforts to develop comprehensive figures on capital flows to&#13;
developing countries highlight the need to expand and to relate the various&#13;
overlapping  data   systems.    It would   be most   helpful,  for  example,   if  the&#13;
classifications of the IMF's balance-of-payments statistics and the DRS could be&#13;
reconciled.    Another area where    further reconciliation would be desirable is&#13;
between the DAC's distinction of official versus private sources of lending and&#13;
the balance of payments' distinction among general government, financial, and&#13;

It is understandable that statistical systems developed by different&#13;
agencies for quite separate purposes at different points in time, each being&#13;
dependent on different statistical offices in member countries9 would inevitably&#13;
have incompatible elements.   But if improvements in the understanding of interna-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
tional capital flows are to come about, harmonization of different data systems&#13;
will be essential.&#13;
The Method for Projecting Flows of Capital&#13;
Linking data on the donor and recipient ends of the flows of capital,&#13;
however unsatisfactory from a statistical point of view, permitted the design of&#13;
a system of projections which took account of aid policies that determined&#13;
capital flows to developing countries, and of the needs of the developing&#13;
countries  associated   with  alternative   development  objectives.     It  further&#13;
permitted the introduction of capital availability as a constraint on the&#13;
balance-of-payments of the developing countries or, conversely, the translation&#13;
of their capital requirements into desirable levels of development assistance&#13;
from major donors.&#13;
This projections system was, however, somewhat less straightforward than&#13;
the statement above suggests.   Starting from the donor side, the main restriction&#13;
was on the availability of capital on terms more lenient than the market&#13;
provided.   These funds, which were almost identical with ODA as defined by the&#13;
DAC, were provided through appropriations in national budgets and subjected to&#13;
the scrutiny of parliaments in the donor countries.      Apart from the usual time&#13;
lags between their commitment and disbursement, their level was thus determined&#13;
by the political process in the donor countries and, implicitly, by the priority&#13;
attached to development assistance in each of these countries.       Projections of&#13;
these flows either had to reflect those political realities as well as possible,&#13;
or they could be made in a normative sense, on the basis of estimated needs of&#13;
the developing countries.&#13;
Political   decisions  concerning   the  level   of  official  development&#13;
assistance are linked with decisions allocating these amounts by countries.      The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
various donors have their own sets of country preferences, wlth c--iteria ranging&#13;
over such factors as previous colonial relationships, the degree of poverty of&#13;
developing  countries, their   political regimEs, or the kinds      of development&#13;
programs which their governments pursue.      The decision to allocate a part of&#13;
resources to multilateral institutions affects the country allocations. In order&#13;
to take properly into account the various policy options, both positive and&#13;
normative  projections were made and presented0       A positive projection takes&#13;
account of these political realities and assesses the amounts which developing&#13;
countries can expect to receive on the basis of the past or stated policies; a&#13;
normative projection, however, suggests allocation changes based on the analysis&#13;
of the prospects of developing countries individually and as grou2s.&#13;
As developing countries were only modest users in relatively large&#13;
markets, it would not have served any purpose to estimate the flows of other&#13;
capital (largely on market terms) in the sEime way. A more appropriate method was&#13;
to incorporate in the projections system the criteria and considerations which&#13;
guided  the suppliers of capital    in these markets when deciding      to lend to&#13;
developing countries.    Most or all of those considerations wrere concerned with&#13;
creditworthiness (that is, the assessment of the likelihood that loans would be&#13;
serviced as contracted)0&#13;
After the allocation of official development assistance was made, the&#13;
sequence of the analysis therefore turned to the economic situation and the&#13;
prospects  of   the  developing  countries   themselves0    Projections   for  each&#13;
developing country provided estimates of the future current account gap that&#13;
would require external financing0    This gap could be reduced by the amounts of&#13;
official concessional capital expected to be received0 The remainder constituted&#13;
the need for lending at market terms and for direct private investment. For the&#13;
latter, independent estimates were made largely reflecting historical trends at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
both the origin and destination ends.      Short-term capital was entered on the&#13;
basis of the growth of a country's international trade.    This left as a residual&#13;
external finance gap the amounts which would need to be obtained at market terms&#13;
and with a maturity over one year.&#13;
The question whether this residual financing could in fact be assumed to&#13;
be available depended on the debt service burden which was associated with that&#13;
level of borrowing, and on the amount and terms of the already outstanding&#13;
debt.   Debt service burdens from previous and new borrowing together could be&#13;
compared to indicators of a country's carrying capacity, usually related to&#13;
exports, the national income, the fiscal position, or combinations of those.    in&#13;
addition to objective indicators of this kind, subjective ones, such as judgments&#13;
about political and economic stability, are also likely to be relevant.      These&#13;
are usually based on past experience, particularly regarding the debt servicing&#13;
record and past recourse to debt renegotiations.&#13;
Once the amounts needed to be borrowed at market terms were considered&#13;
to be reasonably within the limits of proper financial management, these were&#13;
adopted and used as firm projections.     If they exceeded such limits, either of&#13;
two possibilities had to be considered: a larger part of total capital flows had&#13;
to be provided at concessional terms, or the total projected flows had, to be&#13;
reduced to manageable levels.     The first alternative arose only for countries&#13;
with low per capita incomes, where donors preferred in the main to concentrate&#13;
their concessional capital.   The more advanced developing countries - which were&#13;
also the largest borrowers at market terms - depended for their capital flows&#13;
almost exclusively on what was considered to be prudent financial management.&#13;
Thus, total capital flow projections, particularly official flows and&#13;
borrowing   from  other  sources,   consisted  of   a  donor-determined   flow  of&#13;
concessional capital and an element of other lending which was determined by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
balance-of-payments   prospects  of  the   recipient  country  and   the  judgments&#13;
concerning these prospects by the major capital suppliers to the mariets.&#13;
Official Development Assistance (ODA)&#13;
Until 1973 the DAC countries &amp;iere virtually the only source of conces-&#13;
sional capital to developing countries meeting the standards set for ODA: (i)&#13;
administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of&#13;
developing countries as its main objective and (ii) concessional with a grant&#13;
element/10 of at least 25 percent.    ODA consists of grants and official develop-&#13;
ment lending.    Its level has often been measured against a yardstick of 07&#13;
percent of DAC members' GNP, but it has in practice been considerably less.      In&#13;
1970 it amounted (in terms of net disbursements) to 034 percent; and in 1975, to&#13;
036 percent0&#13;
Earliest projections, in 1974 and 2975, uere pessimistic. The ODA fIo;s&#13;
had declined considerably between the 1970 and 1973, and the latter year&#13;
constituted a low point (030 percent) compared to the DAC ccuntries aggregate&#13;
GNP.   This decline resulted not only from the slow rise of new commitments, but&#13;
also from the eroding effect of inflation, which raised the nominal GNP of most&#13;
countries  by  unprecedented   annual  percentages0    Currency  revaluations  gave&#13;
increasing weights to countries with below-average performance, thus reducing the&#13;
average even further0&#13;
/10 Grant element is grant equivalent as a percentage of the face value of a&#13;
financial commitment; grant equivalent is defined as the face value of a&#13;
financial commitment less the discounted present value of the required&#13;
amortization and interest payments using a 10 percent discount rate0&#13;

Early pessimism was not only based on the declines noted in previous&#13;
years:   it also reflected the assumption of a rapid recovery from the recession&#13;
and the restoration of growth in the industrial countries, combined, however,&#13;
with high rates of inflation.     It was doubted whether allocations for ODA would&#13;
be made sufficiently large to keep up with those GNP projections.        Finally, the&#13;
better than expected performance in 1974 was thought to be incidental because of&#13;
large food aid shipments which could not be considered representative for ionger-&#13;
term trends.    In the projections made in mid-1976, the conservative assumption&#13;
for 1980 was dropped, given the provisionally available data concerning the 1975&#13;
performance, which was considerably above earlier expectations.         As detail was&#13;
lacking at the time, it was felt that stated policies of donor countries still&#13;
did not   justify  the maintenance   of the 1975 percentage of 0.36.        A decline&#13;
between 1974 and 1980 was expected, with a subsequent rise towards that level by&#13;
1985. A decline in 1976 to 0.33 percent seemed to substantiate this view./ll&#13;
/11 Note, however, that Robert S. McNamara, Address to the Board of Governors,&#13;
September 26, 1977, Annex III, page 39, assumed a rising ODA percentage from&#13;
1975 to 1980.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
From  1973   the  group  of  capital-surplus   OPEC  countries   became  an&#13;
important new source of ODA.       As these countries did not report to the DAC&#13;
secretariat on their capital transactions with developing countries, their con-&#13;
tribution to actual flows was difficult to establish.     To project these flows in&#13;
the absence of clear statements of policy and under rather uncertain balance-of-&#13;
payments prospects of policy was even harder.     In the first projections exercise&#13;
(in mid-1974) no attemp.t to estimate the contribution of the OPEC group was made;&#13;
instead, the additional capital requirements under alternative development&#13;
strategies were simply listed, without apportionment between OPEC and DAC&#13;
countries.&#13;
Subsequent projections, in 1975 and 1976, benefited from the gradual&#13;
improvements in data on actual commitments by the OPEC countries, and attempted&#13;
to establish links between these commitments and the current account surplus of&#13;
these countries' balances-of-paymentso     But information on the terms of these&#13;
commitments remained scarce, whereas it was also not easy to derive disbursement&#13;
estimates from the data on commitments.      The reporting by recipient countries&#13;
under the DRS gradually provided more insight, but the overall flow estimates&#13;
remained subject to considerable error and doubto&#13;
The 1976 estimates are presented in Table 9, which also contains the&#13;
estimates of flows to multilateral agencies and the flows from those agencies to&#13;
developing  countries0     Flows  of  ODA  to multilateral    agencies  include  the&#13;
contribution (as grants) of member countries to the capitalization of those&#13;
agencies0   These amounts are never passed on to developing countries but are the&#13;
basis  for   borrowing  in  the   capital  markets  by  these   agencies  which  are&#13;
subsequently passed to developing countries at near-market terms0 This is one of&#13;
the main reasons why ODA flows to multilateral agencies almost always exceed the&#13;
ODA flows from these agencies.     Conversely, OOF to developing countries always&#13;

significantly exceed receipts of such capital from member countries.       The last&#13;
line of Table 9 contains the previously discussed adjustments which were&#13;
considered appropriate to bringing donor records more closely in line with&#13;
reporting by recipient countries.&#13;

Allocating ODA Flows&#13;
The distribution of ODA to recipient countries is governed by a variety&#13;
of criteria and donor preferences (which have changed over the years) and by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
types of assistance offered.    The latter factor is, for example, deeonstrated by&#13;
the role which food aid has played in the past.        The amounts s.ave fluctuated&#13;
strongly from year to year, depending on the food situation in maJor food-deficit&#13;
countries, and have through those fluctuations affected the overall allocation by&#13;
countries.   To a lesser extent, this applied to the ODA amounts used for debt&#13;
reorganization.&#13;
The share of the lower-income countries (those with per capita inccmes of&#13;
$200 or less in 1975) never rose to that of their share in the total population of&#13;
the developing countries, notwithstanding efforts to allocate a larger part of 0DA&#13;
to them between 1970 and 1975.      The oil-exporting countries did, however, see&#13;
their share reduced by about one-half between 1970 and 1975, and this shift did&#13;
entirely benefit the middle-income countries, particularly those with per capita&#13;
incomes of about $200 and $520 in 1975.     In Table 10 the date for 1970 and 1975&#13;
are brought together in a summary presentation.    As the data combIne bilateral and&#13;
multilateral flows, it may be noted in addition that, whereas bilateral flcws&#13;
contain a relatively larger share for the middle-income countries, multilateral&#13;
ODA is more favorably distributed towards the lower-income countries.&#13;

The projections assumed, in accordance with stated policy, that there&#13;
would be some increase in the share of the lower-income countries over time,&#13;
reaching proportionality to population shares in 1985.    In alternative (normative)&#13;
projections this assumption was changed, suggesting that the share of the lower-&#13;
income countries should increase faster over time.       It was noted that in 1974&#13;
about $2.0 billion went either to countries with per capita incomes above $1,000&#13;
or to countries receiving $20 or more in per capita terms per year.            It was&#13;
suggested that this amount was available for reallocation to the lower-income&#13;
countries.    It could have added about 40 percent to the ODA - flows directed&#13;
towards those countries.    This was equivalent to about 10 percent of their total&#13;
foreign exchange receipts.&#13;
Other Official Flows&#13;
OOF are largely in the form of official credits to finance the exports of&#13;
the donor countries,-or other transactions on nonconcessional terms.      Projections&#13;
of these flows are based on the best evidence available of transactions in the&#13;
recent past and, at least for DAC countries, on what is known about the operations&#13;
of such institutions as the U.S. Export-Import Bank.    Of necessity, the aggregates&#13;
were based on scattered information of uneven quality.       The information for the&#13;
OPEC countries was even less firm and the projections weaker.     In the case of the&#13;
CPEs, the information was derived from the press or from agencies of other (DAC)&#13;
governments and from the records of recipients.        Much of this information was&#13;
particularly difficult to interpret, because many purchases from CPEs by recipient&#13;
countries were valued at unknown prices, and were often repaid by exports to the&#13;
CPEs with prices and commodity composition left to be agreed upon at some future&#13;
date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
Total Official Flows&#13;
The analysis of official flows "'reeeived0 by groups of developing&#13;
countries was based on the historical record of flows to them, on estimates, and&#13;
on projections, with an underlying assumption that present Policies, and the&#13;
resulting patterns of flows by type and destination, would generally be more or&#13;
less static.    Because all of these flous wre      recorded and projected net of&#13;
amortization, and because the projections were made in light of z-ihat w-s knoun of&#13;
commitments in the recent past, this general assumption was probably sound enough&#13;
for a large proportion of flows for the near-term projected years, though emaker&#13;
after that time.    In the near-term, it was nonetheless at the mercy of oajor&#13;
noneconomic changes, hostilities, natural disasters, and so on, w-Yhich lay outside&#13;
the system of projections.    The identity of each of the main types of flow was&#13;
preserved.   Grants Eere distinguished from loans because the forvEr did not, and&#13;
the latter did, affect the external debt position and prospectS of the recipient&#13;
countries.   Bilateral and multilateral flows uare choun separately because the&#13;
assumptions underlying the projections were somewhat different0&#13;
Private Direct Investment&#13;
As  was  noted  before,  the  information contained iX   the balances   of&#13;
payments of the recipient countries ens taken as the preferred source of past data&#13;
on  private  foreign  direct  investment0    In  a few   cases teis needed    to be&#13;
supplemented from information collected by the DAC secretariat from sources in&#13;
countries of origin0    There were wide differences between DAC datea and the IMF&#13;
balance-of-payments reports0  The balance-of-paymento reports investmants from all&#13;
origins, whereas DAC data cover only member countries, and different treat&#156;ent of&#13;
reinvested earnings   also causes  a discrepancy0     The latter are usually not&#13;
recorded in the balance of payments0      The preferred data source may thus have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
underestimated the contribution to total capital flows.    There would, however, not&#13;
have been any difference in balance-of-payments totals, as, obviously, investment&#13;
income payments were understated by the same offsetting amount.&#13;
Private foreign direct investment is characterized by fluctuations from&#13;
year to year.    In current prices the rate of growth between 1969 and 1975 was&#13;
close to 20 percent per year, and even more if a trend is fitted to the&#13;
estimates.   In constant prices the rate was probably closer to 6-7 percent per&#13;
year. The projections assumed even lower rates for the future, around 4-5 percent&#13;
per year in real terms, to take account that less interest in investment in&#13;
minerals and oil production in developing countries was not entirely offset by&#13;
growing flows for manufacturing industry.&#13;
Borrowing and Debt&#13;
A variety of sources exists for meeting the residual requirements of&#13;
external finance, after account is taken of inflows from official sources and&#13;
private foreign direct investment.      The developing countries' creditworthiness&#13;
ratings determine the availability of such sources.    They can be tapped in various&#13;
ways: by governments or public authorities, in which case there will be a public&#13;
guarantee of the recipient government; or by other agencies in the recipient&#13;
countries either with or without a public guarantee.        Therefore,  the accounts&#13;
(drawn from recipient data) distinguish between public loans from private sources,&#13;
including loans publicly guaranteed, and other (non-guaranteed) borrowing which&#13;
usually  constitutes   a  transaction   between  a  private   lender  and  a  private&#13;
borrower.   As the latter category of lending was not initially recorded in the&#13;
DRS, it was estimated as a residual flow from a comparison between the balance-of-&#13;
payments and the DRS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
The DRS distinguished further, within public loans from ?rivate sources,&#13;
between suppliers' credit, financial markets (including private banks), and other&#13;
private sources.    This information was cross-checked and someti_es supplemented&#13;
with data provided by the DAC countries, particularly on guaranteed (by the donor)&#13;
export credits through the Expanded Reporting System (ERS)o     The World Bank aLso&#13;
maintains a separate information base, the Capital Markets System (CHS), on&#13;
foreign and international bond issues and Eurocurrency credits.      As transactions&#13;
are in the main individually recorded in these systems, detalls of borrowers,&#13;
lenders, terms, and amounts are usually available0    On that basis it was possible&#13;
to obtain a reasonably complete account of all debts which had been incurred in&#13;
the past by the public sector or with a public guarantee; the information also&#13;
permitted projections of future debt service arising from these liabilities.&#13;
Such information was not available for non-guaranteed debt and capital&#13;
flows.  Some reporting took place through the DRS under a progrem started in 1970;&#13;
by 1976D 16 countries provided various degrees of information0    Such borrowing was&#13;
important only in a relatively few countries which had a private sector&#13;
sufficiently creditworthy to borrow0     Several of those countries uere among the&#13;
most advanced, and some published their c-n statistical reports on private&#13;
external debt0&#13;
A survey of these reports suggested that a total of about $22-23 billion&#13;
of outstanding debt without developing country guarantee by the end of 1975 was a&#13;
reasonable estimate for non-oil developing countries0       This rough estimate was&#13;
corroborated by aggregating the net capital flows labeled "other medium- and long-&#13;
term loans" over the period 1967-75 for all countries with positive numbers for&#13;
this item in the balance of payments0/12       This estimate compared with a total&#13;

Inflows of private source capital, subsequent debt accumulations, and&#13;
debt service liabilities were estimated for each recipient country separately on&#13;
the basis of the balance-of-payments prospects and an assessment of prudent&#13;
borrowing levels and debt management.    The creditworthiness assessment was not&#13;
purely objective as it did involve risk assessment which could not be quantified,&#13;
although the use of comparatively objective indicators became more sophisticated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58 -&#13;
over time.  The heavy borrowing by developing coutries. particularly in the years&#13;
1974-769 gave rise to fears that several of these countries would, Ln due course,&#13;
find themselves unable to met their debt service@ liabilities0      The World Baa2t9&#13;
though  directly  concerned,  tended  to  take  a relatively   sanguiine view  which&#13;
gradually was accepted in financial quarters0      The analysis dh:Ich led to this&#13;
attitude is presented below9 as it providec interesting insights into a number of&#13;
interactions and relationships of relevant economic variableso&#13;
Creditworthiness&#13;
The most common approach     to asseaments of creditworthiness ccipares&#13;
future debt service liabilities to export earningso    For a number of years, it xws&#13;
thought that debt service exceeding a particulav percentage o0 export earnings&#13;
constituted a warning signal of reduced creditEsrthiness and increased risks&#13;
associated with new loans to the country0    But ouch a sinple measure cannot convey&#13;
a proper assessment for all countries at all tic3ow&#13;
Obviously, the growth record of a country and, in particular, the export&#13;
performance in past years have a bearing on the assessment0 Linlted to this factor&#13;
is the composition of exports and the stability or instability o.f foreign exchange&#13;
earnings0   Thus9 the calculation of a debt service ratio for a single year 'is a&#13;
very inadequate indicator of debt servicing capacity; the direction and magnitude&#13;
of changes over time are crucial in any examination of debt burden indicators0&#13;
And in cases characterized by instability of esxport earningso    one io clearly led&#13;
to the question whether a country had adequate foreign exchange receipts and has&#13;
preserved its access to INF resources to meet unanticipated declines in export&#13;
earnings  without endangering   the  timely     i     of debt service liabilitieso&#13;
Behind all of this, there is the quality of bnlanceof'p&amp;ymento      anageement by the&#13;
government concerned0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Similarly, there is a significant element of management associated with&#13;
the debt itself.   Problems can arise if a government permits external borrowing&#13;
without some form of control - direct or indirect - or registration requirements&#13;
as to amounts, terms, and purpose.   In the majority of cases, governments are at&#13;
least aware of the debt service burdens which are assumed for the future, or take&#13;
a firm hand in preserving manageable future payments by setting ceilings on&#13;
amounts and terms.   The quality and continuity of debt management plays a major&#13;
role in maintaining access to foreign capital markets.&#13;
It is therefore not possible to rely on one or just a few objective&#13;
indicators of creditworthiness; those are only a starting point, not a substitute,&#13;
for country-specific   knowledge and analysis.     In much of the public     debate&#13;
concerning the rapid growth of indebtedness of the developing countries and the&#13;
international measures to be taken, a lack of such in-depth analysis and excessive&#13;
reliance on aggregated data for country groups have led to unwarranted conclusions&#13;
and to policy recommendations of doubtful quality and usefulness.&#13;
Between 1968 and 1973, the debt of the non-oil developing countries rose&#13;
on average by over 16 percent per year.     As the share of borrowing from private&#13;
sources increased somewhat over that period, average terms hardened somewhat, with&#13;
debt service payments increasing slightly faster, by a little over 17 percent per&#13;
year.    However, export earnings    of  these  countries  increased  about equally&#13;
rapidly, by an average of almost 17 percent per year, resulting in a stable ratio&#13;
of average debt service to exports.     But movements of the ratio over time were&#13;
quite different between individual countries.&#13;
As shown in Table 12, the growth of indebtedness accelerated (in current&#13;
terms) between 1973 and 1976, to more than 21 percent per year.       It should be&#13;
noted, however, that export earnings almost maintained their growth in nominal&#13;
terms, so that on average the indebtedness compared to exports did not rise very&#13;
much.&#13;

Borrowing from private sources, which is the major part of capital flows&#13;
for which creditworthiness is important, is concentrated largely in the group of&#13;
middle-income countries.   Debt to private creditors amounted to only 12 percent of&#13;
total debt of the lower-income countries' by 'the end of 1975; a large part was&#13;
concentrated in only a few countries, particularly Zaire, Sudan, and Pakistan.&#13;
This was at the same time less than 5 percent of total developing countries' debt&#13;
to private creditors.    Oil-exporting countries, which were mostly in a favorable&#13;
balance-of-payments position, accounted for another 17 percent; the remaining 78&#13;
percent was owned by middle-income countries.      And within tha'   group there was&#13;
again a very strong concentration in a few countries: five accounted for almost 70&#13;
percent of private source debt of middle-income countries, and nine countries&#13;
together for about 80 percent0    In order of importance these were Brazil, Mexico,&#13;
Yugoslavia, Argentina, and Korea, followed by Chile, Philippines, Peru, and&#13;
Colombia.&#13;
Whereas rapid growth of debt through 1973 was almost fully offset by the&#13;
growth of exports, between 1973 and 1976 this was no longer so.          In addition,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
while the earlier period was characterized by an even more rapid increase of&#13;
foreign exchange reserves, after 1973 reserves remained stable through 1974 and&#13;
1975, and increased significantly again only in 1976. There was also an important&#13;
change in the growth rate of debt service payments, which, until 1973, equaled&#13;
more or less the growth of exports and of debt; since 1973, debt service grew much&#13;
faster than debt because of harder average terms.    The development for the middle-&#13;
income countries are summarized below:&#13;
1967      1973      1976&#13;
Debt service as % of debt               15.5      16.2       18.7&#13;
Debt as % of exports                    86.2      89.2      105.3&#13;
Debt service as % of exports            13.4      14.5       17.8&#13;
The  continued  heavy  borrowing  through  1976  and the difficulties    of&#13;
reducing balance-of-payments deficits rapidly in sluggish international conditions&#13;
suggested further increases of debt service burdens in the years ahead.       During&#13;
1976 particularly there was considerable doubt about the capability of the major&#13;
borrowing countries to manage their external financial matters properly; these&#13;
feelings were expressed in a number of publications which influence opinion in&#13;
financial markets.&#13;
The World Bank's analysis took account of the changed character of the&#13;
borrowing by these countries: loans from private sources (particularly from banks&#13;
and from the international capital market) were not tied to the execution of&#13;
projects.   Instead, their proceeds were available fully from the day of issue of&#13;
loan.  It was therefore also possible to refinance these loans when they fell due,&#13;
and this kind of financial arrangement was applied rather widely. The willingness&#13;
of lenders to engage in refinancing depended to a significant degree on the prompt&#13;
payment of the other part of debt service: the interest on the outstanding&#13;
amount.   Under conditions of sound financial management, the part of debt service&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
which in fact had to be paid consisted of all interest charges plus amortization&#13;
of official loans.     The element of amortization on loans frorii private sources&#13;
constituted almost half of debt service payments, and was therefore of profound&#13;
importance in the assessment of creditworthiness.&#13;
The level of interest payments thus became an essential part of the&#13;
analysis.   If a country had good overall prospects, then refinancing and changes&#13;
in the maturity of previous loans would be expected to be available.         Interest&#13;
payments depended on rates charged on loans,     These were affected by the adoption&#13;
of variable interest rates, which were reduced after 1974 as inflation rates fell&#13;
and the capital market softened.    The average rates of interest charged by private&#13;
lenders to developing countries were, moreover, at or below the annual rates of&#13;
inflation prevailing in the world economy.        They nevertheless provided needed&#13;
investment  opportunities   for  the  capital  market0    The  developing  countries'&#13;
strategy of borrowing at commercial rates of interest made good sense as long as&#13;
amortization requirements did not place excessive strains on the flow of foreign&#13;
exchange0&#13;
Capital Markets&#13;
The considerations about creditworthiness and debt management described&#13;
above led to estimates of amounts that would be borrowed by each of the developing&#13;
countries  on commercial   terms0    Some effort was made to specify most likely&#13;
sources of these flows, to permit their aggregation0      Those totals could then be&#13;
analyzed further, assessing not only the totals from each source and the&#13;
probability that their growth could be justified, but also the relation of these&#13;
totals to possible overall trends in the major markets in which developing&#13;
countries were expected to borrow0      For example, developing (non-oil) countries&#13;
appear to have used, through the end of 1976, some 10 percent of total available&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
resources of the Eurocurrency market; adding flows to them through so-called&#13;
offshore centers,   this share might be somewhat larger.       They also contributed&#13;
significantly to the total funds available in that market and were therefore not&#13;
likely to find the size of the market to be a constraint on their borrowing.&#13;
This type of analysis could, however, not be carried very far, as the&#13;
relations between private lenders and (public or private) borrowers were quite&#13;
complex and   interwoven.    Some banks which    lent  to developing countries were&#13;
themselves engaged in banking operations within those countries; some were the&#13;
holders of those countries' assets abroad.     Loans by banks were frequently only a&#13;
part of a much larger financial operation which included equity investment by a&#13;
foreign private corporation, combined with a Eurocurrency loan for working capital&#13;
and an officially guaranteed export credit for imported equipment.       At the same&#13;
time the government may have borrowed in the Eurobond market and possibly from a&#13;
multilateral financial agency to finance the necessary infrastructure.&#13;
Profitability has been an important consideration in decisions of private&#13;
lenders to extend credits to developing countries.     So far, only few mishaps have&#13;
occurred, and even those have not been too costly for the banks involved, as&#13;
interest payments have been preserved in debt reorganizations involving private&#13;
lending.  This accounted for a good deal of the staying power of the new borrowers&#13;
in these markets.    One should nevertheless take account of the fact that capital&#13;
markets are sensitive to expressed opinion, even if only based on casual&#13;
judgment.    Excessive pessimism can destroy a balanced       investment climate and&#13;
create severe liquidity problems which, in turn, would have consequences seemingly&#13;
justifying  the expressed   pessimism.   Sound analysis of the debt situation and&#13;
economic management which takes account of its results can perpetuate that&#13;
situation.    In this context,   the impartial analysis by multilateral financial&#13;
institutions  can serve the interests of lenders and of borrowers alike.          The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
manageability of the situation can be further improved if international resources&#13;
are available to meet the needs of these countries in case of export shortfalls,&#13;
for which many are less well-equipped now as compared to the early S970s.&#13;

AN OVERVIEW OF THE GLOBAL MODELLING SYSTEM&#13;
Forecasting and Bank Operations: The Need for Consistency and Sensitivity&#13;
Analysis of Projections&#13;
The Bank needs projections both for general planning purposes and to&#13;
ensure that individual lending operations are based on coherent assumptions about&#13;
the future.    The projections presented here were also developed to complement&#13;
other international organizations *analyses of prospects of the world economy.&#13;
The broad sweep of the Bank's economic intelligence system of the early&#13;
1970s was surveyed in the first part of this book.       It covered the growth of&#13;
individual developing countries, trends in commodity markets, and capital flows&#13;
from developed to developing countries.     The system integrated data collecting,&#13;
forecasting, and decisionmaking.   This second part describes how global modeling&#13;
was used to complement the detailed data-collecting and forecasting work.&#13;
The high degree of decentralization of this intelligence system was both&#13;
its strength and its weakness.    It was a source of strength because it made it&#13;
possible to draw on the detailed firsthand knowledge of the operational staff.&#13;
It was a source of weakness because"it mhade it difficult to build up a consistent&#13;
picture of economic trends.&#13;
Routing of this information through the Economic Projections Department&#13;
of the Bank solved the consistency problem only partly.      Centralization of the&#13;
data processing ensured that definitions were consistent, and made it easier to&#13;
spot and to eliminate obvious errors in the basic data.      The statistical staff&#13;
were gradually able to acquire an understanding of the biases which affected the&#13;
data, making it possible to improve the consistency of the data produced in spite&#13;
of its diverse origin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66 -&#13;
Consistency of forecasts was no less impoxtant than consistency of&#13;
data.    The Bank's   activity  required  correct  judgments about  the appropriate&#13;
allocation of funds between borrowers, and about the selection of economically&#13;
justifiable projects.    It was clear that these judgments had to be based on a&#13;
consistent view of the future.      It would not do, for example, to compare the&#13;
creditworthiness of two countries on the basis of export projections which&#13;
reflected different views of the future rate of growth of the world economy, to&#13;
base  cost-benefit   calculations   for  different  sugar   production  projects  on&#13;
different sugar prices, or to undertake simultaneous lending projects for a&#13;
commodity which would lead to production increases       so large that they could&#13;
disrupt its market.&#13;
Producing consistent forecasts raises problems of a different order than&#13;
those  involved  in producing consistent    statistical data.     Forecasts  involve&#13;
personal judgments about the future, and reconciling different views about the&#13;
future is a more delicate task than reconciling numbers.&#13;
It has been argued that consistency of forecasts can be achieved readily&#13;
through "horsetrading sessions" in which psrticipants argue out their dif-&#13;
ferences, without   any need   for a formal model0       Such  sessions  are  indeed&#13;
necessary, and in fact they provide a vital channel for the exchange of informa-&#13;
tion  which   conditions   the  forecasting   process0     But  this   approach  has&#13;
limitations.&#13;
It is easy to achieve agreement about fects: about the policy measures&#13;
recently adopted by a government, or the date at which new production facilities&#13;
will begin   to produce0    But reconciling divergent views of the future also&#13;
requires agreement about the repercussions of those events       aboz't their impact&#13;
on prices, incomes, and other variables0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
One of the important functions of a model is therefore to provide an&#13;
agreed view of the economic mechanisms involved in formulating a forecast, so as&#13;
to make it easier to reconcile differences of opinion in the future.      Experience&#13;
suggests that no model is detailed or accurate enough to cover all aspects of the&#13;
situation.   A country. economist may, for example, feel that the price of the&#13;
coffee exported by his country will move differently from the price of the type&#13;
of coffee predicted by the model.       It may be argued that a new disease will&#13;
reduce yields and depress output below the level predicted by the supply&#13;
equation.    The model eases the task of reconciling divergent views, but the&#13;
forecasts which are finally used as a basis for decisions usually do not coincide&#13;
precisely with those predicted by its equations.&#13;
A perhaps even more important function of a global model is to produce a&#13;
consistent set of basic forecasts for use in generating the detailed forecasts&#13;
required for decisionmaking.    Any detailed forecast involves, in addition to a&#13;
knowledge of facts and mechanisms which are specific to a market or a country,&#13;
assumptions about future changes of global variables such as the rate of&#13;
inflation in the world, the growth of world trade, of GNP in developed countries,&#13;
etc. The use of a global model assures that such forecasts are compatible with a&#13;
coherent view of developments in the world economy.&#13;
What must be emphasized above all is that the global model is but one&#13;
element of a broad attempt at comprehending the future.         Bank operations are&#13;
inseparable from attempts to comprehend the future, and this implies that a wide&#13;
diversity of forecasts tends to be made throughout the Bank.        The model is an&#13;
essential component of this forecasting effort, but it is only one of the&#13;
pieces.   It can help to reduce inconsistencies among projections, but there are&#13;
too many divergences of opinions to preclude their complete elimination among&#13;
forecasters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68&#13;
Alternative Modelling Strategies&#13;
Three approaches are conceivable in modeling the world economy.         The&#13;
first is to specify and estimate a comprehensive model to answer a wide range of&#13;
questions.   This approach was used as early as 1953 in the model of the world&#13;
economy designed by Neisser and Modiglianio/13      Many models of that type have&#13;
been built since that time.    Recent well-known examples are those of the Club of&#13;
Rome and that built for the United Nations by Leontief, Carter, and Petri0/14&#13;
A problem with this approach is that it takes a centralized team of&#13;
specialists to build a coherent and comprehensive global model.     This may be the&#13;
best organization in academic research, but in a policy-oriented organization&#13;
there is some risk in splitting model specialists from those involved in&#13;
analyzing  current  developments0     A  specialized  group  of model   builders  is&#13;
probably able to build and to operate sophisticated models, but there is a r'isk&#13;
that they might lose the grass roots knowledge of current facts, and produce work&#13;
which seems irrelevant and out of touch with reality to those whom the model is&#13;
meant to serve0&#13;
The single-model approach may also not be flexible enough to satisfy all&#13;
needs0   Answering a given question usually requires a detailed representation of&#13;
only part of the economy:    other parts can be represented in an aggregated way0&#13;
Multipurpose models therefore tend to be quite large, with all the problems of&#13;
errors and difficultiess in analyzing output w'nich characterizes very large&#13;

models./15   A multipurpose model is of course richer than a system designed to&#13;
answer a narrowly defined set of questions.     But in operational use, when speed&#13;
is at a premium, this gain may be more than offset by the loss of time involved&#13;
in manipulating large systems of equations.&#13;
One of the most promising trends in model building in recent years has&#13;
been the development of methods of linking models built by different teams into a&#13;
broad and comprehensive system.     The pioneering effort in this field has been&#13;
Project LINK.    This approach avoids the tendency of the builders of the global&#13;
model to become separated from reality.       Their main function becomes that of&#13;
fitting into a coherent system fcomponent models built by persons who have&#13;
detailed knowledge of the various parts of the world economy.         This makes it&#13;
possible to draw on a far greater pool of knowledge than would be available to&#13;
any centralized model-building team, while retaining the consistency and the&#13;
ability to represent global interactions which characterize global models.&#13;
Linkage is, however, a less elegant approach than the design of a single&#13;
global model.   Because their design is not coordinated, the individual models may&#13;
be difficult to fit together convincingly.      Individual models tend to contain&#13;
large groups of equations predicting variables which are of interest to the&#13;
country itself, but could be dispensed with from the point of view of analyzing&#13;
interactions among countries.    The resulting linked model may therefore be much&#13;
larger  than necessary.     On the other hand,     individual  model  builders  very&#13;
naturally attempt to pay greater attention to interactions among domestic&#13;
variables than to the mechanism through which countries interact.          There is&#13;
therefore a bias towards underestimation of the interdependence of countries.&#13;
/15  The increase in size is often multiplicative rather than additive.          For&#13;
example, if there are n" products and "m" regions in a country, an&#13;
input/output system which seeks to describe production regionally, will have&#13;
an (nm x nm) coefficient matrix.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
For these reasons, linkage of the minimum standard models wras not an&#13;
attractive solution.    The 40-odd RMSMs are quite large, principally because of&#13;
their detailed representation of the foreign debt of borrouing countries to a&#13;
much greater degree of detail than would be needed for global analysis0      At the&#13;
same time, the mechanisms which determine grow^sth are described quite crudely; the&#13;
growth of particular sectors is in fact frequentiy treated as exogenous0    Linkage&#13;
of these models would not have been an effective way of studying the impact of&#13;
the outside world on the growJth of developing countries0&#13;
Linkages finally, requires a major effort in specifying and estimating&#13;
the linking equations, and running the system as a whole     through the computer.&#13;
The specification of the linkage equations has to take account of any inconsis-&#13;
tencies in the choice and definition of the variables involved in linkage0&#13;
Variables which at first sight seem similar may, for example, differ because&#13;
different model   builders  have  used  different  sources0   The adjustments are&#13;
conceptually not difficult, but may ln practice absorb a substantial amount of&#13;
time and effort0&#13;
The   approach  wshich  was  eventually   used - parallel   simulation  of&#13;
overlapping models    is by far the simplest to operate, and is undoubtedly the&#13;
one most widely used by policy-making organizatlons.       The bacic elements are&#13;
models built by different persons or groups of personr, describing different&#13;
parts of the economy, having overlapping variables w-yhich are common to two or&#13;
more of the models.   The overlapping variables could be used to link the models&#13;
together formally, provided that appropriate equations were used to convert each&#13;
model's variables into those of the others0    Yt is simpler to operate the models&#13;
in what has sometimes been termed as a "conversational mode"' in which the output&#13;
of simulation of each model suggests alternative runs of the otherso&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71&#13;
This approach, of course, does not make it possible to reflect, except&#13;
in a rough way, feedbacks of one model to the others.      This is a serious problem&#13;
only if these feedbacks are strong.     If not, a "conversational" use of models can&#13;
be made to yield as much of a feel for the workings of the world economy as would&#13;
result from the operation of a fully linked model system.&#13;
An Overview of the Model System&#13;
The model system was designed to study the interaction among the&#13;
economies of the non-oil-exporting developing countries, the developed countries,&#13;
and  the oil-exporting developing    countries.    These were grouped into regions&#13;
linked by trade and capital flows, the definition of which varied from year to&#13;
year.   A special attempt was made to represent the relation between commodity&#13;
prices and the level of aggregate output in the world economy by a system of&#13;
commodity models.&#13;
(i) The determinants of growth of developing countries: the SIMLINK model&#13;
The dominant problem confronted by developing countries at the time when&#13;
the global modeling system was first built was a severe balance-of-payments&#13;
crisis resulting from a sudden drop of the purchasing power of their exports.&#13;
The non-oil-exporting developing countries were hard hit by the near quadrupling&#13;
of oil prices.    The boom in grains prices, which continued into the year 1974,&#13;
added to their difficulties; the recession in developed countries was beginning&#13;
to affect the exports of developing countries.&#13;
It was obviously necessary to focus the initial modeling effort on these&#13;
problems.   The SIMLINK model, the first version of which was built in 1974, was&#13;
designed to assess the impact of these balance-of-payments pressures, and to&#13;
suggest ways of reducing     them by appropriate aid policies./16        An important&#13;
/16 See Chapter V for a complete description of SIMLINK.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 &#13;
objective was to illustrate how changes in the level and allocation of aid might&#13;
avoid cutbacks of the growth of developing countries and, in par;icular, of the&#13;
poorest among them.&#13;
It was felt that until 1980, the terminal year of the projections, the&#13;
shortage  of foreign exchange would be the main constraint on the growth of&#13;
developing countries: in the phraseology of the two-gap model of developing&#13;
countries'   growths  the   "dominant   gap'0  would  be  the   balance-of-payments&#13;
constraint.   This implied a model structure of the type described by the heavy&#13;
arrows in the diagram below0&#13;
The model describes a recursive mechanism, in tyhich developing countries&#13;
respond to changes in the purchasing power of their exports and :-eceipts of aid&#13;
by adjusting the level of their GNP to a level at which imports are equal to&#13;
foreign exchange receipts.     The prices of their oil exports are exogenous,&#13;
while - this is the Sost original feature of the model        commodity prices are&#13;
determined endogenously by a system of commodity market models. Capital flowJs to&#13;
developing  countries  are  treated  implicitly  as endogenous.    'In alternative&#13;
simulations,  the  amount  of  official development   assistance  extended  by the&#13;
developed countries is related to their GNP, wtfhile the amount of aid from members&#13;
of OPEC is related to the surplus of their balance of payments0&#13;

multipliers: an analysis of the short-run impact of events affecting the&#13;
world economy0&#13;
According to the SIMLINK models, GNP changes in developei countries are&#13;
the strongest of the forces which affect the growth of developing countrieso     It&#13;
was clearly necessary to improve the understanding of how- these changes are&#13;
determined.&#13;

In  the  short-run,   the  relevant  mechanisms   are  Keynesian.    It  is&#13;
necessary to account for the forces wnich are responsible for shnort-run changes&#13;
in the level of aggregate demand. Examples are (see dashed arrows in Figure l)-&#13;
(a) The increase of oil prices was to a certain extent comparable&#13;
to an excise duty imposed on oil-importing countries 'oy the&#13;
members of OPECo To the extent that this drain on purchasing&#13;
power was not offset by a corresponding increase of imports by&#13;
members of OPEC, it should be counted as one of the factors&#13;
contributing to the recession.&#13;
(b) It was widely expected initially that the increase in oil&#13;
prices would lead to a sharp upsurge of investment in the&#13;
production of oil, coal, and nuclear power./17      Thnis invest-&#13;
ment did not materialize, because of the opposition of&#13;
environmetalists to nuclear power, offshore oil exploration,&#13;
and strip mining of coal, and because energy prices in the&#13;
U.S. were kept at low levelso    But it seemed at tne time that&#13;
it would become a significant force in pulling developed&#13;
countries out of the recession.&#13;
(c) Developing countries resorted heav-'ly to foreign borrowing in&#13;
1974 and 1975 to maintain growth ln spite of the pressure on&#13;
their  balances-of-payments0     The  imports  financed  oy this&#13;
borrowing helped to sustain employment in the early years of&#13;
the recession0&#13;
/17 See, for example, the forecasts of OECD in Energy Prospects to 1985: An&#13;
Assessment of Long-Term Energy Developments and Related Policy, (Paris,&#13;
1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
(d) Finally, it was desirable to have a means of assessing the&#13;
impact on the world economy of the fiscal policy measures -&#13;
both expansionary and deflationary - which were adopted by&#13;
governments of developed countries from the beginning of the&#13;
recession./18&#13;
The analysis of the impact of events such as these requires a large&#13;
model.   This model should be able to represent adequately the short-run dynamic&#13;
interactions involved; it must also indicate how short-run changes in demand are&#13;
transmitted from country to country.    It would have to describe the economies of&#13;
developed countries, which play a dominant role in business-cycle fluctuations.&#13;
No such model was available in the Bank, nor would it have been sensible&#13;
to build one for the purpose; a substantial amount of work on linked short-run&#13;
models of developed economies already existed.     It would have been pointless to&#13;
duplicate it.&#13;
It would have been possible to run simulations on one of those models to&#13;
assess the impact of the events mentioned.     Even this would have been a complex&#13;
task,  because  of  the size of the models.       As only rough estimates    of the&#13;
magnitude of these impacts were needed, it was decided to adopt a simpler&#13;
approach involving the models' dynamic multipliers.&#13;
Dynamic multipliers measure the impact on the variables of a model of&#13;
specified changes of their exogenous variables.        They are calculated as the&#13;
difference between a "perturbed solution," in which one exogenous variable is&#13;
changed with respect to a "base case solution." Each perturbed solution makes it&#13;
possible to calculate how a given change in one exogenous variable modifies each&#13;
/18 A number of countries - the U.S. in particular - have sought to expand&#13;
demand by tax cuts. Many others have, however, increased taxes and cut back&#13;
spending in an attempt to reduce budget deficits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 &#13;
of the model's "M" endogenous variables: the multipliers thus defined form a&#13;
vector for each year.     If "N" exogenous variables are perturbed successively,&#13;
then the dynamic multipliers form an (M x N) matzix0&#13;
The dynamic multipliers are constants only for linear models; in the&#13;
non-linear case, the matrices depend on the chosen base case solution.       Present&#13;
day business cycle models are nonlinear.     However, experience suggests that they&#13;
behave almost like linear systems, so that assuming constancy of the dynamic&#13;
multiplier matrix is a reasonable simplification if all that is desired is to&#13;
evaluate the order of magnitude of the impact of specific events./19&#13;
(iif) The lasting impact of the recession on potential growth of developed&#13;
countries: the simple developed countries growth models: the OECD&#13;
potential growth evaluation0&#13;
A prolonged recession may affect the future production potential of the&#13;
economy by changing the rate of technical progress, and by reducing the rate of&#13;
growth of the labor force and of the capital stocko     There is little that can be&#13;
said on the size or magnitude of the first of these impacts: a recession may slow&#13;
down technical progress by stimulating Malthusian reactions which reduce pro-&#13;
ductivity, or accelerate the latter as producers are driven to maximize effi-&#13;
ciency to stay in business0 The impact of the recession on the growth of factor&#13;
supply can, on the other hand, be quantified in rough terms0&#13;
The impact which the recession might have on growth via changes in the&#13;
supply of factors/20 was therefore calculated on the following lines0      The first&#13;
step was to use Cobb Douglas functions to estimate the rate of technical progress&#13;
/19 The construction of the system used is decribed in the appendix to this&#13;
chapter0&#13;
/20 Various versions of the procedure were used at different times0 We describe&#13;
only the basic idea0&#13;

in the 1960-73 period by means of the regression&#13;
(log Y - 0.33 log K - 0.67 log L) = log a + ct&#13;
where Y = GNP, k = capital stock/21, L = labor force, c = rate of technical&#13;
progress, a = scale factor of the Cobb Douglas function&#13;
Y = AK033 L 0.67 ect&#13;
in which capital and labor exponent values of 0.33 and 0.67 are imposed a priori.&#13;
The next step was to set down a range of possible recovery scenarios of&#13;
the economies of developed countries, based on the observation of rates of&#13;
recovery from earlier postwar recessions.     This made it possible to assess the&#13;
rate of growth of the capital stock in the post-recession period, using observed&#13;
data for past years and estimates based on projected savings for later years.&#13;
The savings projections were obtained by applying savings functions from models&#13;
of developed countries to GNP projections from the alternative recovery paths&#13;
described above.&#13;
The recession was likely to have a lasting impact on the growth of the&#13;
labor force in European countries as a result of foregone migration from the&#13;
Mediterranean developing countries during the recession years.     It would probably&#13;
also affect immigration into North America, Australia, and New Zealand.       But as&#13;
most of the latter flow involved migrants from other developed countries, they&#13;
involved no change in the labor force available in developed countries and,&#13;
accordingly, changes in this type of migration flow were neglected./22&#13;
The potential labor force figures were built up from projections for the&#13;
population by age and sex, allowing for trends of the participation rates and&#13;
/21 The capital stock figures were built up by the permanent inventory method,&#13;
using assumed initial capital stock figures suggested by available studies&#13;
and an average amortization rate of 5 percent.&#13;
/22 The U.S. receives a substantial number of workers from Mexico including many&#13;
illegal migrants.   No allowance was made for the impact of the recession on&#13;
this inflow.&#13;

sharply reduced immigration flows into Europe.   It was assum2d thuat unemployment&#13;
rates in future periods of full employment would be kept at a level exceeding by&#13;
1 percent the low levels of the 1960s and early 1970s, to preverit inflation&#13;
forces from building up once again0    As a result of the RIesser tension on the&#13;
labor market, immigration into Europe would otay at the low levels reached during&#13;
the recession.&#13;
Inserting these capital stack and labor force projections then made it&#13;
possible to calculate the paths of potential output in deve4.oped countries0&#13;
Because of the impact of the recession on factor supply, the rate of grauth along&#13;
this path lay appreciably below-7 the rate of groxwth achieved in 1l6O=73o&#13;
(iv)  Energy prices and potential greuth of developed countries: the SfMRIC-&#13;
model.&#13;
Many observers have stressed that the rise in oil prices wlES likely to&#13;
reduce potential growth of developed countries0     A careful esaamination of the&#13;
mechanisms through which oil prices affect grcyth suggests that these ~e-re&#13;
substantially more complex than appeared at first sight    too complex in fact to&#13;
be readily grasped without the aid of a modelo&#13;
These mechanisms include:&#13;
- A welfare loss, reflecting the termssof trade loss in the oil&#13;
importing countries at the high oil price, plus the w£lfare cost&#13;
involved in the substitution of high-cost dcmestic energy for&#13;
part of the cheap oil initially imported, and in energy&#13;
conservation0&#13;
-  This loss was offset to a certain extent by the gain derived by&#13;
developed countries at very low- rateS of interesto&#13;
I It has been argued, on the other hand, that the increase in oil&#13;
prices inflicted a capital stock loss on developed countries, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
a result of the accelerated obsolescence of energy-intensive&#13;
capital goods bought before the rise in oil prices.&#13;
These issues ought to be studied in a dynamic context. For this reason,&#13;
the SIMRICH model designed to study them is a dynamic neo-classical growth&#13;
model. This is described in Chapter VII.&#13;

THE SIMLINK MODEL AND THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
A. Background&#13;
The Bank's SIMLINK/23 model was designed to study the impact of higher&#13;
oil prices, of changes in business conditions in OECD countries, and of changes&#13;
in the flow of foreign aid in developing countries0/24        The model was not a&#13;
theoretical breakthrough, but combined existing modeling techniques into a&#13;
comprehensive system which provided inputs for policy decisions relatively&#13;
quickly.&#13;
In recent years modeling work lnvolving developing countries has largely&#13;
been along three broad lines: country models, international trade models, and&#13;
commodity models.    While each approach can yield useful insights, none can be&#13;
used alone to make definitive statements about the linkage effects of world&#13;
events0&#13;
Developing Country Models generally take exports to be either largely&#13;
exogenous, or sold under perfectly competitive conditions0         In either case,&#13;
export prices do not depend on the model solution0       Aggregation of models of&#13;
course provided no assurance that the results would be consistent: the sum of the&#13;

/24  As elsewhere in this monograph, "developing countries" or "..DCs" refer to&#13;
all developing countries except for members of OPEC and centrally planned&#13;
Economies (CPEs)o   "OECD countries" refer to the more industrialized members&#13;
of the Organisation for EconomLc Cooperation and Development, excluding&#13;
Greece, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Iceland, and Yugoslavia0&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

import and export price and volume estimates for a group of models would only&#13;
fortuitously be in line with world demand and supply.&#13;
International  Trade Models.    Constructing  a matrix of international&#13;
trade flows, and distributing world imports and exports among countries according&#13;
to past trade relationships, ensures that total world imports will equal total&#13;
world exports, and'that the estimated trade balances of a group of countries will&#13;
be consistent with each other.   Such models usually include only sketchy analysis&#13;
of the domestic economies of the different countries.        A more comprehensive&#13;
approach has been attempted in Project LINK, starting with large econometric&#13;
models of developed countries, and linking them through an entirely consistent&#13;
set of world trade equations.    LINK has up to now lacked detailed models of the&#13;
developing world countries, and its main thrust has been toward short-term&#13;
estimates of trade and growth rather than longer-range projections.      Though the&#13;
model contains submodels for developing regions, estimated by UNCTAD, and has of&#13;
late been used for three-year forecasts, it remains a model focused on developed&#13;
countries and emphasizing short-term fluctuations.    This made it unsuitable as a&#13;
basic tool of analysis for the World Bank.&#13;
Commodity Models.    Examining world trade on a commodity-by-commodity&#13;
basis was thought to be very useful from the developing countries point of view,&#13;
as most of their exports were primary products which were traded on world markets&#13;
with little differentiation as to source and destination.        However, commodity&#13;
models, like country models, were generally solved in isolation.      This could be&#13;
misleading for certain commodities which can be substituted for each other.       A&#13;
combination of commodity models would ensure that country price and volume&#13;
projections for the commodities in question were consistent with the world&#13;
market, but fitting these models together would pose major problems, because of&#13;

&#13;

- 82 &#13;
the diversity of existing models - using different dates and time periods        and&#13;
the diversity of levels of aggregation and choice of variables./27&#13;
B. The SIMLINK Approach&#13;
SIMLINK combined elements of all three of these approaches./28      Exports&#13;
of the developing countries were related to the level of economic activity in the&#13;
industrialized  countries  through individual commodity models.       Growth in the&#13;
developing countries was linked to investment levels and imports; the latter, in&#13;
turn, were tied to export earnings and the inflow of external capital (as&#13;
indicated by the real resource transfer, or balance on merchandise and non-factor&#13;
services).   The model would be run to determine the import and GDP growth levels&#13;
of developing countries which were permitted by a particular capital inflow and&#13;
set of GDP growth rates in the OECD countries, or to determine the real resource&#13;
transfer needed to support a specified target growth rate of GD? in developing&#13;
countries, given expected developments in the OECD countrieso        SIMLINR may be&#13;
thought of as being block recursive in the following steps:&#13;
(a)  The rates of growth of output and prices in the developed&#13;
world (largely the OECD countries) were taken as exogenously&#13;
determined.     Since   the  developing   countries  had   little&#13;
feedback effect on the developed world, this was felt to be a&#13;
reasonable assumption;&#13;
/27  For a survey of some commodity models and commodity modeling techniques, see&#13;
WO   Labys,   Dynamic   Commodity   Models:   Specification,   Estimation   and&#13;
Speculation (Lexington, Mass., 1973)o&#13;
/28  SINLINK went   through successive stages of updating and improvement;9 the&#13;
version discussed here is the one in existence and used in mid=19750&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
(b) Some commodity models were used to calculate the world prices&#13;
and the world demand for primary commodities exported by&#13;
developing countries.    The price of petroleum was taken as&#13;
exogenous, and so were the prices of commodities for which no&#13;
models were developed.&#13;
(c) Exports of manufacturep and services from developing countries&#13;
were   projected  on   the  basis   of  historically   estimated&#13;
elasticities with respect to OECD growth, modified to take&#13;
account of an expected fall of these elasticities. Prices for&#13;
these items were projected on the basis of exogenously&#13;
forecasted rates of inflation in the OECD;&#13;
(d) The commodity trade volumes and prices so calculated were&#13;
translated  into  export  volumes,  import  prices,  and export&#13;
prices for seven groups of developing countries;&#13;
(e) A simple growth model was used to relate the growth of each of&#13;
the seven groups of developing countries to the growth of&#13;
their  imports and   to investment.    These models were then&#13;
solved to calculate the level of GDP growth which equated&#13;
total imports with the capacity to import, defined as the sum&#13;
of the value of exports and an exogenously specified level of&#13;
capital  inflow.    They were also   solved  imposing exogenous&#13;
target GDP growth rates; the resulting balance-of-payments gap&#13;
was an estimate of the foreign capital inflow required to meet&#13;
those targets.&#13;
The version of SIMLINK presented here contained 14 commodity models with&#13;
a total of about 79 structural equations, 11 equations for estimated exports of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84-&#13;
manufactures and services, and 7 regional models with 7 beha-ioral equations&#13;
each.   Ignoring definitional equationo and identities, the model had a total of&#13;
146 structural equations.   Uhile ccmprehensive in nature, it thus rsmained simple&#13;
enough to be calculated quickly.   It mas eatimated by least squares and was block&#13;
recursive.   Figure 2 gives a rough idea of the structure of the model.         The&#13;
period covered by estimation varied from equation to equation according to the&#13;
availability of data: the shortest sample was 6 years; the longest, 20.&#13;
C0  The Model in Detail&#13;
The model started wiAth a data base foz a sample panel of 40 developlg&#13;
countries hiich accounted for about 85 percent of the population of the&#13;
developing market econcmies (excluding OPEC members)0      Based on 1973 data, the&#13;
panel received over 80 percent of the net disbursemwnts on public loans and&#13;
accounted  for over 80 percent of the external       public debt   (outstanding and&#13;
disbursed).   Its share in the aggregate GNP of developing countries was slightly&#13;
smaller - 76 percent in 1973.     It accounted for 70 percent of the exports of&#13;
developing countries in all regions except East Asia and the i-lediterranean - in&#13;
these tuo regions the trading role of a few nornrsmple panel countries (notably&#13;
Singapore, Hong Kong, and Spain) loared the panel's coverage to about 61 percent&#13;
(based on 1973 data).   For the purposes of the model, the sEmple panel countries&#13;
were aggregated into seven "regions" or groups, ~Thich are shonm in Table 130&#13;

substantial   share  of  the  exports  of any   one  regional  group.    Models   were&#13;
developed for the most important commodities       (excluding petroleum).    They are&#13;
summarized in Table 14. Exogenous price and volume estimates were used for a few&#13;
important commodities for which it proved difficult to develop useful models.&#13;
Some of these, like wheat, cotton, and tobacco, had been influenced in the past&#13;
by US surplus policies.&#13;
Supply.    On  the  supply  side,  the models   assumed  a distributed   lag&#13;
response by producers to past prices, based on biological and information lags.&#13;
The general form of the supply equation can be expressed as&#13;
Q. = (P.   , Pt2 ; ...Pi       X °1 02'   `od&#13;
where Q is the supply of the      J  commodity, Pj is its real price -lagged by an&#13;
appropriate number of time periods, and the 0's are other variables.           In most&#13;
cases, total supply Qj was the sum of two or more supply equations estimated on a&#13;
regional or country basis in order to capture the differences in supply response&#13;
patterns   apparent  in   different  arenas   of  the  world.     The  lagged   prices&#13;
Pt-2 ... p        were often dropped in favor of simple lagged supply,        Q&#13;
thus introducing the assumption of a distributed lag with geometrically declining&#13;
weights./29     In some cases,    such as  rice,  where   world  prices  were  largely&#13;
determined by fluctuations in exports and a large part of the production was not&#13;
exported, the model dealt only with exports rather than total world production.&#13;
The prices of substitutes were important in only a few commodity models: rice&#13;
(wheat),  tin  (aluminum),  and  fats and oils (other fats and oils).         Summary&#13;
/29 For a discussion of the use of the lagged endogenous variable as a transform&#13;
of the distributed lag equation, see Zvi Grilliches, "Distributed Lags: A&#13;
Survey," Econometrica, Vol. 35 (January 1967).&#13;

variables were inserted to reflect unusual conditions present in certain years,&#13;
many of wilch could be traced to weather fluctuations.     Most of the models were&#13;
estimated econometrically with annual time series data from the S955-72 period,&#13;
although the time period differed slightly in each model0       In certain regions&#13;
where no econometric relationship cculd be uncovered, an exogenous supply&#13;
estimate was used (see Table 14),&#13;
Demand.   The price formation or demand side of the models was generally&#13;
estimated in one of two ways0     In some models, prices were estimated to be a&#13;
direct function of world supply and demand, giving an equation of the folloz-ing&#13;
form:&#13;
Pj =f(Y, Q, 0, O2' 0o0 0n)                                       (2)&#13;
where Y uas total OECD GNP, Q w^as the total of world exports or production, and&#13;
the 01 are other variables important in price deteraination (for example, the&#13;
prices of substitutes, dummay variables, and the rate of wxorld inflation).      An&#13;
alternative to the simple direct price formation equation (2) above was the&#13;
slightly  more  complex  stock  adjustment  approach0    Here,  the demand vector&#13;
determined consumption of the commodity in questiono    Inventories or stocks were&#13;
defined as current production less current consumption plus stocks from the&#13;
previous year, and real prices were determined by the level of stocks (which may&#13;
be expressed as an inverse relationship or as a ratio to total production)0 This&#13;
three-equation method of determining prices can be summarized as follows:&#13;
C1   f(Y, P, 0)                                                   (3)&#13;

where Cj stands for consumption and Sj for end-year stocks, wir.th only the lagged&#13;
variables subscripted for time0    Other variables may be included in the consump-&#13;

2.  Manufactured Exports/32&#13;
A slightly different approach was used for developing countries manu-&#13;
factured exports.   First, since these countries accounted for a relatively small&#13;
share of total manufactured exports, it was assumed that supply and demand were&#13;
not reconciled via the price mechanism.    Total demand by the OECD and centrally&#13;
planned countries for manufactured exports from developing countries was allo-&#13;
cated among the seven groups of sample panel countries according to market shares&#13;
based on initial exogenous estimates of the growth of supply.    To estimate income&#13;
elasticities of demand, log-log regressions were run, using constant prices,&#13;
between the GDP and manufactured imports from developing countries (regardless of&#13;
source), of groups of OECD countries, and of the centrally planned economies.&#13;
The data for these regressions were based on UN trade data and covered the period&#13;
1965-72.  The results are summarized in Table 16 below:&#13;

These rather high elasticities had to be adjusted for' two factors0&#13;
First, they relate to 68 developing ccuntries, including Hong Kong, Singapore,&#13;
and Taiwan; and second, they did not obvicusly take account o manufactured&#13;
exports to other developing, rather than to developed, countries0    So as to avoid&#13;
overstating export demand, the export growth rate calculated for the 40 scaMple&#13;
panel developing countries between 1965 and 1972 - 12.2 percent per annum - tas&#13;
compared with the rate of growth of import demand in OECD coaunries (fram all&#13;
developing countries)   for the same period -- 1507 percent per annum - both in&#13;
constant prices.   The ratio of these two growth rates (0.777) was used to adjust&#13;
the original elasticities downward.&#13;
An estimate of the aggregate supply of manufactured -exports from&#13;
developing countries was used to arrive at the market shares of the seven&#13;
regional groups, taking account of historical growth rates in constant prices for&#13;
the period   1965-72.    For  two regions, South Asia and East/Central Africa,&#13;
political events in 1970-72 meant that manufactured exports grew at lower than&#13;
historical rates, so the growth rates      for 1965-70 ware used instead0      These&#13;
supply  estimates,   each  region's   share  of   total  sample  panel   exports  of&#13;
manufactured goods, and the importance of manufactured goods in total exports&#13;
from sample panel countries are shown in Table 17:&#13;
Using the 1972 percentage distribution (column 2), a weaighted average&#13;
growth rate of supply of manufactures was calculated, and compared to the average&#13;
growth rate of demand, weighted according to the shares of OECD and centrally&#13;
planned country groups in total demand0 The initial estimates of the growth rate&#13;
of supply were then adjusted so that the growth rates of aggzegate rates of&#13;
aggregate supply and demand were equal0      Algebraically, if SMH   is the initial&#13;
supply growth estimate for the ith developing country region, and Dii        is the&#13;
demand growth estimate for the jth developed region, and wdi and usi are the&#13;

3. Service Exports&#13;
Services are another very important source of export earnings in&#13;
developing countries, but are often ignored in trade models due to the lack of&#13;
data on an origin-destination basis.     Data for non-factor service exports were&#13;
obtained from the World Bank's socio-economic data in current prices for each&#13;
region for the period 1964-72.   It was assumed, once again, that the OECD was the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
principal source of demand for these services, which included touviEm, travel,&#13;
and shipping services.&#13;
As with manufactures, the OECD was disaggregated into three regions:&#13;
North America, Western Europe, and Japan/Oceania.    Regresslons uzn2e then run to&#13;
estimate demand elasticities with respect to the GNP of each of the OECD regions,&#13;
with the best estimate being used in the model. Since the observrztion period x-ia&#13;
relatively short, only single-variable regressions pere attmnpted.      Wnile the&#13;
income of the Japan/Oceania region did not prove significant for any sample panel&#13;
region9 a combination of Japan/Oceania and North America worke&amp; well for three&#13;
regions, with Western Europe proving best for another two, and total OECD&#13;
accounting for the remaining two. The resulzs are shown in Table 18 belau./33&#13;

/33 Unlike the manufactured export :Eegressions, the non-'factc-: seri'rice regres-&#13;
sions were done in current prices.      In the model, the   ,:-ojected current&#13;
price service exports were deflated by the implicit GON dej-:ator of the OECD&#13;
countries to convert to constant prices0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
The estimated equations all show good fits, and all of the income elas-&#13;
ticities are significant at the 95 percent confidence level or higher.        It is&#13;
interesting to note the wide differences in elasticities, from 0.45 for South&#13;
Asia to 1.9 for West Africa.    Areas with a highly developed tourism sector seem&#13;
to have higher elasticities than those without, and this is probably the major&#13;
factor explaining these regional differences. The 1.9 elasticity for West Africa&#13;
appears to be unusually high and was probably influenced by the very rapid deve-&#13;
lopment of tourism in this region during the past few years starting from a low&#13;
base. This coefficient was lowered to 1.4 for projection purposes in the model.&#13;
4. Prices and Inflation&#13;
The consistency between current and constant price estimates was main-&#13;
tained by the use of a series of international price deflators.       The four main&#13;
indices of world inflation that were used in the model are shown in Table 19.&#13;
IPI - the international price index - was used both to inflate projected real&#13;
commodity prices to current prices and to serve as a price index for manufactured&#13;
imports by developing countries.    IPIXM - the price index of manufactures - was&#13;
used to inflate the value of exports of manufactures from developed countries.&#13;
IPI - the GNP price index - was used to convert the GNP growth of OECD countries&#13;
from real to current terms, and to inflate the value of non-factor service&#13;
imports and exports.    IPICAP, the price index of capital goods from developed&#13;
countries.&#13;
For each of the seven sample panel regions, SIMLINK constructed an index&#13;
of export value and export volume using the 1972 weights shown in Appendix I,&#13;
Tables 30 and 31.    Regional export price indices (XPI) were determined by the&#13;
export value and volume indices: real export prices of each region were converted&#13;
to current prices by multiplication by XPI, and, using 1972 weights, the export&#13;
price index was then calculated in current prices. Regional import price indices&#13;

(MPI) were made up from series of five basic indices for each region, constructed&#13;
on the basis of imports in 1972 divided by end-use class into food, interme-&#13;
diates,  fuels, capital goods, and non-factor services.        The price indices for&#13;
capital goods and non-factor services were based on assumed international&#13;
inflation  rates.    The  price  index  for  fuels was assumed    to equal   that  for&#13;
petroleum.   For food imports, a weighted price index was constructed using the&#13;
commodity prices generated -by the model./34      The weights used were based on an&#13;
analysis of the composition of food imports of the larger developing countries.&#13;
5. Regional Growth Models&#13;
The regional indices of export value, export volume, and import prices&#13;
were applied to 1972 base data in 1967-69 prices to derive estimates through&#13;
1980.    Export values,   expressed  in constant   dollars, were   then adjusted   for&#13;
changes  in  the  terms   of  trade  to  produce  "adjusted  exports"   (XADJ),  which&#13;
reflected import-purchasing power.      The adjusted exports for each region were&#13;
defined as:/35&#13;
XADJ =   xPI X                                                       (8)&#13;
where X represented exports in constant prices, and MPI and XPI were the relevant&#13;
regional import and export price indices, respectively.        Total import capacity&#13;
(Ma) was then defined as the sum of XADJ and the capital inflow available, or&#13;
resource gap (RGa).     Capital inflows were estimated exogenously, according to&#13;
analyses of countries' creditworthiness and the availability of external capital.&#13;
M  = XADJ + RG                                                      (9)&#13;
/34  The commodities included and their weights were: wheat, 40 percent; rice, 15&#13;
percent; maize, 5 percent; sugar, 15 percent; tobacco, 5 percent; groundnut&#13;
oil, 15 percent; and beef, 5 percent.&#13;
/35  All  variables   are  for   period  "t"  and   region  "i",  unless  subscripted&#13;
differently.&#13;

Imports and Growth&#13;
Much discussion has taken place over the relationship be-tween imports&#13;
and growth, and the importance of fore&amp;.gn exchange versus other constraints in&#13;
the developing world./36   Some authors have contended that there ic no relation-&#13;
ship, or that increases in imports (particularly those financed from increases in&#13;
capital inflows) result in lower savings, higher constaption, and no appreciable&#13;
increase in growth./37     Such analyses have tended to examine imports in the&#13;
aggregate, and their relationship to total GNPo       In fact, developing ccuntry&#13;
imports are a very non-homogenous mixtture of capital goods, intermediate&#13;
products, raw materials, foodstuffs, and other consumer goods that are not&#13;
related to capital formation and production. The imports of foodstuffs are often&#13;
inversely  correlated  with   growth,  since  they  often  supplemenr.  declines  in&#13;
domestic agricultural production.   In most of the better country codels, imports&#13;
are disaggregated in some fashion, usually by end-use classes, and related either&#13;
to sector outputs or to some parts of GNP expenditure.&#13;
Following the same approach, a general model of growth and imports was&#13;
formulated along the follow^aing lines-  First, industrial production was assumecd&#13;
to be a linear function of total GDP:/38&#13;
YIND= al + b1 GDP (value added, industry)                         (10)&#13;

Investment was a function of the increment to GDP and lagged investment,&#13;
as implied by the flexible accelerator where the desired capital stock adjusted&#13;
with a distributed lag.     In this case, the implied lag was of the Koyck type,&#13;
with geometrically declining weights:&#13;
I =a2 + b21 (GDP - GDPt- ) + b22It_1 (gross investment)            (11)&#13;
Imports of capital goods were then related linearly to investment;&#13;
intermediate goods, to value added in industry; and imports of fuels and non-&#13;
factor services, to total GDP, or:&#13;
MCAP     =    + b3 I      (imports, capital goods)                 (12)&#13;
MINT      a4 + b 4 YIND   (imports, intermediate products)         (13)&#13;
MFUEL  =a5 + b5 GDP       (imports, fuels)                         (14)&#13;
MSER    = a6 + b6 GDP     (imports, non-factor services)           (15)&#13;
It was initially proposed to relate imports of food to private&#13;
consumption and to agricultural production, and imports of other consumer goods&#13;
to private consumption expenditures. However, in almost all cases the results of&#13;
so doing were nonsignificant or had the "wrong" signs.       (In the case of food it&#13;
can be expected that imports vary inversely with domestic production, and&#13;
directly with consumption.)      It appears that imports in both these categories&#13;
were heavily influenced by the availability of foreign exchange.        The proxy for&#13;
foreign exchange availabilities was taken to be the actual level of imports of&#13;
goods, so that the combination of food plus other consumer goods imports was&#13;
simply related to this variable:/39&#13;
MCF =a 7+ b7MG                                                      (16)&#13;

/39 In South Asia and East/Central Africa, exogenous estimates of MCF were used,&#13;
based on a projected increase in food grain imports and constant imports of&#13;
other foods and consumer good.       In the base case, a growth rate of 3.5&#13;
percent was used for food grain imports in both regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Total (actual) imports of goods is defined as:&#13;
MG   MCAP + MINT + MFUEL + MCF                                     (17)&#13;
and total import demand, at a given level of GDP, as:&#13;
Md = MG + MSER                                                     (18)&#13;
where the "d" subscript denotes import demand, as opposed to the capacity to&#13;
finance imports, M.&#13;
Two Versions of the Model&#13;
So far the discussion in this section has focused otn the availabilities&#13;
version of the model, in which the amount of foreign capital which was available&#13;
was exogenous0   In this versions an equilibrium condition was enforced such that&#13;
import demand must equal the capacity to import, or&#13;
Md = M                                                             (19)&#13;
The model was then solved for that level of GDP and GDP growth which&#13;
would satisfy this condition.&#13;
In the requirements version, target GOP gzowth rates (g) were specified&#13;
exogenously for each region:&#13;
GDPt = GDPt 1 (1 + g)                                            (20)&#13;
The capital inflow that was required to support such a grcuth rate (RGC)&#13;
was determined as the difference between      imrort demand and the capacity to&#13;
finance imports, based on export earnings:&#13;
RGr = Md - XADJ                                                    (21)&#13;
Hence the requirements version dropped equations 9 and 19 from the&#13;
model, and used 20 and 21 to determine a cepital inflow endogenously from a pre-&#13;
determined growth level.   The additional capital requirement (ACR:) w-as defined as&#13;
the difference between the capital available and that required to attain the&#13;
growth target:&#13;
ACR = RGr - RGa                                                    (22)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
Savings Rate&#13;
Domestic savings (GDS) can be determined residually from the identity:&#13;
GDS = I - RG&#13;
This residual determination of savings is the consequence of considering&#13;
foreign exchange, rather than domestic resources (savings, capital, or labor), as&#13;
the binding constraint on growth in the developing world.        This is a serious&#13;
simplification.   However, since the model is being used to project over a period&#13;
when deteriorating terms of trade and low export volume growth would squeeze&#13;
foreign exchange earnings, the simplification appeared acceptable.      The ex post&#13;
calculation of the savings rate allows for a rough check that this rate is&#13;
realistic, and that a savings constraint is not binding.&#13;
Regression Results&#13;
The estimated   equations are given in Table 20.        In general,  these&#13;
equations were estimated on the basis of pooled cross-section and time series&#13;
data for the period 1966 to 1971, although the exact time period differed&#13;
slightly from region to region.    The time period used was short because of the&#13;
shortage of data on imports by end-use.   The data used here were derived from the&#13;
United Nations Trade Yearbook, allocated to end-use classes on a two-digit SITC&#13;
level.  The data for individual countries in each region were pooled together for&#13;
estimates of the region, using the technique of including an individual constant&#13;
term for each country.    This increases the degrees of freedom and offsets the&#13;
shortness of the observation period.    While the R2 of the estimated equations is&#13;
low, almost all of the estimated coefficients were significant at the 95 percent&#13;
level.&#13;

Major problems arose with the regression for South Asia: the past&#13;
history of that region, with recurring natural disasters and wars, made almost&#13;
all of the regressions nonsignificant.    Data for the period 1968-71 were used to&#13;
estimate coefficients based on simple averages.     This implied that import elas-&#13;
ticities were close to unity, although this may have been far from the truth for&#13;
that region.   In both South Asia and East/Central Africa, the apparent stability&#13;
of investment in the face of unstable output made it necessary to substitute an&#13;
investment function based on total income, rather than on incremental income and&#13;
lagged investment.&#13;
D. Properties of the Model&#13;
1. Assumptions&#13;
The properties of SIMLINK may be illustrated by simulations undertaken&#13;
in 1975 in studying the prospects of developing countries. These results give an&#13;
idea of the model's response to a realistic set of alternative assumptions.&#13;
For OECD growth, the most important exogenous variable of the model, two&#13;
alternative  parts were   judged  equally likely.     The  "high" OECD growth case&#13;
assumed swift recovery from the recession - full employment by 1977-78, followed&#13;
by a period of growth at pre-1974 rates.     The annual average growth rate between&#13;
1975 and 1980 was 6.1 percent, while that between 1974-80, including the major&#13;
recession year of 1975, was 4.9 percent./40 The "low" growth case assumed a slow&#13;
recovery, so that full employment was not reached until after 1980, and annual&#13;
growth averaged 4.6 percent between 1975 and 1980 and 3.5 percent between 1974&#13;
/40 All growth rates quoted in this paper are compound rates of growth between&#13;
the indicated end points (i.e., 3.5 percent for 1974-80 is the growth rate&#13;
from end 1974 to end 1980 and does not include growth in 1974.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 --&#13;
and  1980   To facilitate exposition, the average of the tw^o, "acdium OECD&#13;
growth," was used as the base case in the sensitivity test.&#13;
Two assumptions as to the price of petroleum were used in simulations of&#13;
the model.   The basic assumption was that the price of petroleum (Saudi Arabian&#13;
light crude, f.o.b0 Ras Tanura) remained constant (in 1974 prices, at US$9040 per&#13;
barrel through 19800   The alternative allowed for a gradual decline in the real&#13;
price to US$7050 per barrel (in 1974 prices) by 1980          The constant price,&#13;
consistent with OPEC's announced intentions, was used as the base case.&#13;
The projections of exports of goods and services to OPEC countries were&#13;
based on the simulations of the SIMRICH model.      In 1972, the 40 sample panel&#13;
countries accounted for 5.9 percent of OPEC imports; if this share could be&#13;
maintained, it appeared that exports to the OPEC market might become a signifi-&#13;
cant source of foreign exchange earnirngs&#13;

oil prices on the developing countries.    The impact was examined from two points&#13;
of view.   The first four columns of the table calculated the growth rates con-&#13;
sistent with the exogenously projected capital flows, under different assumptions&#13;
concerning  oil  prices  and growth   in the OECD   countries.    The last   column&#13;
indicates the amounts of additional aid which would be required under each set of&#13;
assumptions to achieve the target growth rates of the requirements versions.&#13;

income countries was somewhat less sensitive to OECD GDP than that of the middle-&#13;
income countries (elasticities of 0.65 and 0.85, respectively). But because their&#13;
rate of growth was lower, the reduced expansion of the developed countries GDP&#13;
was enough to bring the rate of growth of their per capita income close to zero.&#13;
It is interesting to examine the mechanisms through which lower growth of&#13;
the developed countries influences the foreign exchange earnings of developing&#13;
countries.   As Table 26 shows,    the volume of exports of primary product was&#13;
relatively insensitive to this growth.     Exports of manufactured goods were much&#13;
more sensitive: with high OECD growth, export volumes of these products expanded&#13;
at 15 percent per annum, but with low growth at only 11 percent.          Exports of&#13;
services were also quite elastic with respect to OECD growth.&#13;

For export prices,   the results were just the opposite.        The primary&#13;
commodities  prices  implied by   the commodity models    embedded  in SIMLINK were&#13;
sensitive to changes of the rate of growth of demand.    It was assumed on the other&#13;
hand that the prices of manufactured exports of developing countries depended only&#13;
on world inflation.&#13;

Table 27 assesses the sensitiviy of the developing countries' terms of&#13;
trade to growth in the OECD countries. A modest improvement w-yas envisaged in all&#13;
these simulations from the unfavorable 1975 level.      Low-income countries w-yould&#13;
gain  slightly more than the middle-income     countriesO/42   The terms of trade&#13;
appeared moderately insensitive to OECD GDP° the elasticity for all develop4ng&#13;
countries was 0.26.    It should be remembered that this -was a     edium-run price&#13;
response; in the short run, the elasticity would probably be higher.&#13;
A decline in the real price of petroleum would benefit developing&#13;
countries, although its impact on the purchasing power of their earnings twould be&#13;
partly  offset by louer exports to the oil-exporting      countries0    The results&#13;
suggested that one 1975 dollar reduction in the price of oil in 1980 would have&#13;
raised the feasible LDC growth rate by about 0.17 percent.&#13;
The requirement simulation suggested that a substantia.'. increase in aid&#13;
was required to enable developing countries to achieve growth rates approaching&#13;
the UN target0   As shown by the table, it e-as the middle-incoae countries which&#13;
accounted  for much of this.     The laoer-income countries, in the South Asian&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

subcontinent in particular, had fairly closed economies, and an acceleration of&#13;
their growth did not require very large additional amounts of foreign aid.&#13;
The amount of additional aid required by developing countries was quite&#13;
sensitive to the assumptions on OECD growth and oil prices.    The amounts listed in&#13;
the last column suggest, however, that even under the most favorable oil price and&#13;
OECD growth assumptions, unrealistically large amounts of capital would have been&#13;
required to achieve "required" rates of increase of GDP matching the growth&#13;
potential of developing countries.      It was interesting, therefore, to use the&#13;
model to examine whether a balanced set of policies consistent with these targets&#13;
existed.'&#13;
3. Policies to Achieve More Rapid Growth&#13;
A policy package which would have provided the foreign exchange required&#13;
to achieve these higher rates of growth might have involved:&#13;
-   higher   exports  of  manufactured  goods   from  developing  to  developed&#13;
countries;&#13;
-   higher exports from developing countries to members of OPEC;&#13;
-   increased amounts of ODA.&#13;
An accelerated increase of manufactured exports could have been achieved&#13;
through a combination of export promotion by developing countries and permissive&#13;
import policies by developed countries.     This might have brought the per annum&#13;
increase from 13 to 17 percent, raising the growth rate of export volumes between&#13;
1974 and 1980 from 7.3 to 8.4 percent per annum, and the growth rate of GDP from&#13;
4.4. to 4.9 percent. The middle-income group received a disproportionate share of&#13;
the benefits, as they were the main exporters of manufactures.&#13;
There also appeared to be scope for enlarging the developing countries'&#13;
share of the OPEC market. The extremely rapid increase of demand in oil-exporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 --&#13;
countries was creating new export opportunities which could benefit those&#13;
developing countries which adopted suff½ciently active and flexible policies.     It&#13;
appeared quite possible to expand their market share from 5.9 to 8.5 percent by&#13;
1980.   As the table shows, this would have been enough to permit an increase of&#13;
the GDP growth rates from 4.4 to 4.7 percent.         The impact on the low-inceme&#13;
countries was particularly large: their GDP growth rates would have increased to&#13;
4.1 percent in the base case.     Because of their proximity to OPEC markets, the&#13;
lower-income countries of Asia and East Africa could derive substential benefits&#13;
from an expansion of OPEC markets.&#13;
It could be hoped finally that the declining trend of the share of&#13;
official development assistance in the GDP of developed countries might be&#13;
reversed.  In the base case, the share of ODA in GNP was assumed to fall from 0.30&#13;
percent in 1973 to 0.24 percent by 1980.    An increase to 0.37 percent would make&#13;
available US$3.8 billion of additional capital per year during the 1977-80&#13;
period.  It was assumed that this amount would be allocated in a Wanner that' would&#13;
have enabled the lower-income countries to attain a 5 percent grouth target&#13;
between 1977 and 1980.   This would have resulted iln an overall growth rate of 4.9&#13;
percent.&#13;
As Table 28 shows, these policies were sufficient to bring the rate of growth&#13;
of GDP of developing countries up to 5.6 percent.        This did not match the UN&#13;
development decade targets - nor even the more modests targets of the requirements&#13;
version of the model.&#13;
E. Dynamic Multipliers of SIMLINK&#13;
Simulations of SIMLINK suggest that the model's response to exogenous&#13;
variables appears to be roughly linear. A table of dynamic multipl_ers is&#13;

EXOGENOUS INPUTS FOR THE SIMLINK FRAMEWORK&#13;
The global system did not attempt to project, within that system, the&#13;
economic developments in the industrial countries. The Bank had on occasion felt&#13;
that it should have its own view abouat controversial issues wi-th respect to the&#13;
developed countries' growth, such as the OPEC surplus recycling problem, or the&#13;
impact of higher oil prices on developed       countries growth.    'But it did not&#13;
possess firsthand knowledge about these countries comparable to its knowledge of&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
Unfortunately9 little work was being done elsewhere on the long-term&#13;
perspectives of the industrial countries that could serve as en input into the&#13;
Bank's  global  system.    The  IMF, which   's mainly   concerned with   short-term&#13;
balance-of-payments and monetary policies, regularly projects the growth and&#13;
trade of the industrial countries in a global context for the next 12-18 months,&#13;
but not beyond that horizon0 The work of the OECD Secretariat has until recently&#13;
been concerned only to a limited extent with longer-term prospects.         The main&#13;
concern has also been the next 12-18 months9 and the economic policies which were&#13;
expected  to  create   or  maintain  stability   and  balanced  gTowth.    The  OECD&#13;
Secretariat's studies of long-term development projected a full decode ahead, but&#13;
they have principally been a summary of national projections to which some&#13;
consistency tests were applied0    The Interfutures Project undcrtaken within OECD&#13;
broke with this tradition, but its results were not available when the Bank was&#13;
carrying out the analysis described in this book0&#13;
The projections made by the Bank made use of the OECD and IMF&#13;
projections for the years for which those were available0       Beyond that period,&#13;
the basic assumption was that policies to contain inflation would be given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
priority, even at the cost of some unemployment and idle production capacity.&#13;
This suggested a slow recovery from the recession and the attainment of a&#13;
situation around 1980 which would be characterized by somewhat slower growth than&#13;
in the decade of the 1960s and a rate of unemployment about one percent above&#13;
levels in the previous decade.   In the first projections, when the depth of the&#13;
recession and its duration were not foreseen, this return to a stable long-term&#13;
rate of growth with somewhat higher unemployment was seen to occur in 1979; later&#13;
projections have gradually shifted this point further into the future, to around&#13;
1981.&#13;
Projections of inflation had less analytical basis.   It would be fair to&#13;
say that the sources of inflation in the industrial countries, particularly in&#13;
the years since 1972, were not well understood.     The various changes that have&#13;
occurred in the international monetary system, and particularly the introduction&#13;
of floating exchange rates, have made the analysis considerably more complicated&#13;
as the transmission between countries and regions took place under different&#13;
conditions than those of the past.&#13;
The tools used for sensitivity analysis of OECD growth were described&#13;
earlier.   Chapter IV briefly described the MULTILINK system and the analysis of&#13;
potential growth, and the SIMRICH model is described in Chapter VII.      Implica-&#13;
tions for capital flows (particularly from official sources) were reviewed in&#13;
Chapter III.   The present chapter will thus be concerned mainly with the growth&#13;
and inflation projections for the industrial countries.&#13;
Projections of Real Growth&#13;
The growth projections for the industrial countries displayed a fair&#13;
degree of optimism.   The developing countries were linked to the industrial ones&#13;
through trade and capital flows, and their prospects depended significantly on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 8&#13;
growth in developed countries.   The Bank was publishing projections of growth of&#13;
developing countries which were substantially oelow those implffed by the UiN&#13;
Development Decade targets.   Perhaps to avoid the impression that the projections&#13;
for the developing countries wJere unfavorable simply because of a pessimistic set&#13;
of assumptions for the industrial countries, the latter wx-ere biased to the&#13;
optimistic side.&#13;
The comparison of the projections shotwm in Figure 5, which presents the&#13;
successive estimates of 1974 through 1977, is clear in that respect.      The first&#13;
projection presented only a very mild recession and a rather speedy return to&#13;
"normal" growth, equal to the rate observed during the l960sr       The GNP of the&#13;
industrial countries would thus deviate below the trend only slightly, and return&#13;
to that trend within a few years' tfme0       The policy assumptions behind th-rB&#13;
projection suggested measures designeo to stimulate economic graoth, partly to&#13;
shorten the recession, but also to offset the real income loss caused by the oil&#13;
price increase.   The 1974 version also contained a lower alternative growth path&#13;
which assumed less adequate policies to promote recovery, and also stated that&#13;
this alternative was not considered the most realistic.      In fact, most of the&#13;
subsequent analysis of the world economy was based on the higher growth patho&#13;
The next version, made in the middle of 1975, could not take so sanguine&#13;
a view0 The recession had taken on larger proportions in the course of 1974 and&#13;
early 1975, making it rather unlikely that full recovery could be achieved in the&#13;
course of 1974 and early 1975, making it rather unlikely that full recovery could&#13;
be achieved in the course of just a few years.         Policies in the industrial&#13;
countries were strongly centered on the containment and reduction of inflation,&#13;
and it became doubtful whether a reasonable degree of full eaployment could be&#13;
regained before the end of the decade0&#13;

The 1975 version nevertheless maintained some optimlis, as the basic&#13;
assumption remained the restoration of a reasonable level of employment around&#13;
19800   It was, however, considered unlikely that the trend of the 1960s could be&#13;
regained, even though long-term grouth rates might again become equal to the&#13;
average of the previous decade.   Thus, a new growth trend parallel but lower than&#13;
the old trend was adopted in this verslon0&#13;
An interesting point might be noted here w^Cith respect to the composition&#13;
of growth in a geographical sense.   The dependence on imported oil is highest in&#13;
Japan,  followed  by  the European   industrial  countries,  and  lowest  in North&#13;
America.   Thus, the income transfer as a consequence of the o0l price increase&#13;
was seen to affect North America least, the other countries more.      In addition,&#13;
alternative sources of energy and the technology related to the substitution of&#13;
imported oil by other forms of energy were to a large extent located in North&#13;
America, and could cause considerable earnings to be obtained by North America as&#13;
a result of energy substitution in Europe and Japan.    Finally, the adjustment of&#13;
exchange rates in the early 1970s had greatly improved the American competitive&#13;
position in international markets.    These three factors together were considered&#13;
of sufficient importance to project higher than historical rates of growth for&#13;
North America, somewhat lower ones for Westezn Europe, and considerably lower&#13;
ones for Japan0   The latter also to some extent reflected the cnanged development&#13;
priorities in Japan which preceded the events of 1973 and 1974o     As a result of&#13;
these changes between the past and the perceived future, all versions uniformly&#13;
projected a higher growth rate for North Amerlca compared to Western Europe,&#13;
reversing the past relationship0&#13;
The projections made subsequently in 1976 wsere more pessimistic,&#13;
although the differences tended to decline over time.     A signiificant element in&#13;
the lowering of projected growth rates was the actual growth performance since&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
1973, which each time had to be lowered from earlier estimates.     But in addition,&#13;
the insistence of policymakers in the majority of industrial countries on the&#13;
priority of price stability and the unexpected persistence of inflation led to&#13;
the conclusion that expectations of future growth had to be cut.&#13;
A set of rather bothersome questions concerning long-term growth has as&#13;
yet not been resolved.    The first one relates to the actual performance of the&#13;
industrial countries in the past, on which much of the reasoning for the future&#13;
is based.    There is a rather common assumption that the industrial countries&#13;
together increased their real output in the past by an average rate of 4.8 to 4.9&#13;
percent per year. This rate applied in fact to the period between 1958 and 973,&#13;
or to "the 1960s," variously defined, but may not be representative for the long-&#13;
term trend.   When a longer period is considered, starting with 1950 and extending&#13;
to 1973 or 1975, a lower rate is observed, at about 4.2 to 4.3 percent per&#13;
annum.   Compared to the latter trend, it appears that the 1960s were a somewhat&#13;
exceptional period which started and ended above that trend.&#13;
The thesis that the lower rate, found for the longer period, was more&#13;
relevant for long-term projections could be defended.       The steeper gradient of&#13;
the actual growth curve in the 1960s could be attributed to the effects of&#13;
international trade liberalization and the creation of the European Communi-&#13;
ties.  But by the early 1970s these factors could not provide the same impetus to&#13;
growth as they did during     the 1960s.    One could also argue that efforts to&#13;
restore the higher rate of growth of close to 5 percent per year would bring back&#13;
the problems of the early 1970s, with scarcities of major commodities, tight&#13;
labor markets, and a strong stimulus to inflation in many industrial countries&#13;
and in international trade. The projection contained in the 1977 version of the&#13;
Bank's global projections, which suggested a long-term growth rate of about 4.4&#13;
percent, may thus still have been on the high side. A second problem arose with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
122 &#13;
respect to the terms-of-trade loss due to the rising oil prices0          FrEm the&#13;
national accounting point of view, th-s was interpreted as a sou-een cut in real&#13;
national income in 1974.    In practice, as oil-exporting countrics could not uoe&#13;
the additional foreign exchange and accumulated surpluses whicr uere reinvested&#13;
in developed countries, the cut in purchasing w7as a gradual one.&#13;
Income  losses   of  this  nature   do  not  necessarily   translate  into&#13;
production losses.    Policies can be devised to replace purchasing power lost&#13;
through terms-of-trade changes by stimulating domestic demand. '.n order to avoid&#13;
large  imbalances  between  industrial  countries which twould   follou  from  such&#13;
policies and their consequences for import demand, that approach would need to be&#13;
carefully orchestrated between the industrial countries themselves0 A return to&#13;
the long-term growth trend would then be poss-Ible, although th9ns does leave out&#13;
of consideration the effects of the oil price increase on the productive value of&#13;
the existing stock of capital goods.     The latter point is, hoTever, one of the&#13;
main themes in the SIMRICH model.&#13;
Projections of Price Development&#13;
Inflation projections were of importance for tw-io purposes0   One was the&#13;
need for a nominal projection of the gross domestic product of the donor&#13;
countries who were members of the DAC in order to provide the basis for future&#13;
flows of official resources to the developing countries. There was also the need&#13;
for a price index representative of price developments of manufactured goods&#13;
exported by the industrial countries0    The latter index played an important role&#13;
in the estimation of the import prices of the developing countries and the&#13;
projection of their terms of trade0&#13;
Inflation in the industrial countries rose to unprecedented rates in the&#13;
years 1973 and 1974.   On average, the GDP deflator of the industrial countries,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
measured in U.S. dollars, rose by more than 10 percent annually between 1970 and&#13;
1974.   The boom of commodity prices in international trade and markets, which&#13;
started about the middle of 1972, contributed to inflation, but the direct impact&#13;
was  modest.     According  to  calculations   by  the  OECD  Secretariat,  non-oil&#13;
commodities contributed about 1 percentage point to inflation in 1973 and in&#13;
1974; the contribution of oil was 0.3 percent in 1973 and rose to 1.5 percentage&#13;
points in 1974.    Together, these commodities therefore affected price movements&#13;
in the OECD area only modestly compared to the overall inflation rates prevailing&#13;
at the, time.    But this should be considered only part of the impact which&#13;
commodity prices had on the general price developments.    Prices of other sources&#13;
of energy rose in sympathy with the oil price, and higher costs were passed on to&#13;
the consumers by higher prices of final outputs.&#13;
Internal market imbalances in the industrial countries no doubt played&#13;
an important role in fueling inflation.    And once high rates of price increases&#13;
became a common feature in virtually all of these countries and in international&#13;
trade,  the inflation fed on itself as confidence in a return to more stable-&#13;
conditions waned and economic agents came to base their plans on the expectation&#13;
of  continuous  price  increases.    These  developments  have  made  it  extremely&#13;
difficult to devise a reliable method for projecting future price developments.&#13;
Certainly models and relationships which appeared valid in the past could be&#13;
relied  on only   to a limited extent.      Uncertainty  about future oil prices,&#13;
combined with the fear that cartelization could occur for other primary commodi-&#13;
ties, added to the problem.     And beyond that, it was considered by some that&#13;
serious supply bottlenecks might arise in coming years for an increasing range of&#13;
commodities.&#13;
The analysis is equally, or even more, difficult with respect to export&#13;
prices.    In most of the OECD countries,     there used to be a fairly stable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
relationship between the general price developments in the country and the&#13;
behavior of export prices.   The latter tended to increase at a slower rate, This&#13;
was to be expected on the basis of the differences in the composition of GDP as&#13;
compared to exports. The large weight of services in the GDP particularly tended&#13;
to raise the GDP deflator above the export price index.     This was reversed after&#13;
1970 when input prices rose either because of international developments&#13;
(particularly in primary commodity markets) or because of supply constraints in&#13;
the face of strong demand.    In a strongly expansionary situation, producers were&#13;
able to pass on these costs increases as much to foreign as to domestic&#13;
clients.   In fact, internal demand was so strong for a few years that export&#13;
markets increasingly became residual and export prices began to rise even faster&#13;
than domestic prices.    It is hard to say exactly to what extent and how quickly&#13;
the past relationship between domestic and export prices would re reestablishedo&#13;
With floating exchange rates, exchange rate uncertainties made it&#13;
difficult to choose a yardstick for measuring inflation0        The U.S. dollar was&#13;
used  to measure   changes   in  prices0    To measure   a country's   export  price&#13;
development, it is thus necessary to project its domestic currency as well as its&#13;
exchange rate movements0     Implicitly, this raised the issue of the estimated&#13;
equilibrium exchange rate for each country0     This was a question which the Bank&#13;
for obvious reasons did not want to answer0&#13;
The price projections made in successive years since 1974 are presented&#13;
together in Figure 60     It will be noted that there is less of a consistent&#13;
pattern over time for these projections      than for the GNP projections0      This&#13;
demonstrates the uncertainty which has surrounded these estimates0      But to some&#13;
extent an interrelation with the growth projections can be discerned; the opti-&#13;
mistic growth projections of 1974 were accompanied by inflation projections&#13;
ranging around a rate of 9 percent per year0 In more recent years, the avowed&#13;

policy objectives and their emphasis on curtailing inflation were reflected in&#13;
both lower rates of inflation and lower rates of real growth.        in passing, it&#13;
should be noted that some of the differences between successive versions are&#13;
caused by variations in country coverage; this is particularly the case for the&#13;
1977 version, which includes all industrial ("OECD North"¢) countries, whereas&#13;
earlier versions were limited to the major industrial countries only.&#13;
The projections of manufactured export prices changed less over time&#13;
than  the projected GDP deflator.       In the 1974 version, expor-t prices were&#13;
assumed - as in the past - to rise less steeply than the GDP deflator0 Thus, the&#13;
inflation rate projected for GDP, at 9 percent per year, was accompanied by an&#13;
export price increase of 7.5 percent per year0     In subsequent versions, howfever,&#13;
this differentiation was dropped, as it was felt that the uncertainty about the&#13;
prospective development of prices was too great to permit this kind of refine-&#13;
ment0   It was also argued that strong demand from the oil-exporting countries,&#13;
combined with efforts to substitute (more expensive) domestic energy for imported&#13;
oil, could even lead to a relative rise of manufactured goods prices as compared&#13;
to the GDP deflator0&#13;
The inflation rates presented in Figure 6 were measured in U.S. dollars,&#13;
and included assumptions on domestic inflation rates in eacn country's own&#13;
currency as well as assumptions about exchange rate changes0 For the longer run,&#13;
the simple assumption made was that differences of inflation rates measured in&#13;
national currencies would be compensated for by changes in exchange rates0      This&#13;
implied that the exchange rates in some base periods were taken to be equilibrium&#13;
rates0   This is an easy assumption to work with, but not a very good one in&#13;
reality, as in each year cases can be observed where exchange rates are in the&#13;
process of adjustment, too high or too low0    Average rates for any base year are&#13;
therefore misleading.    The assumption can therefore lead to distortions in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
projections.   Each year an effort was therefore made to predict exchange rate&#13;
movements over the next 6-12 months which would tend to equilibrate a country's&#13;
currency against the U.S. dollar.    These "adjusted" rates were then taken as the&#13;
base for the projections.    As this exercise was a rather speculative one, only&#13;
aggregate price projections for groups of countries not the detailed calcula-&#13;
tions, were presented.&#13;

THE SIHRICH OECD MODEL: ESTIMATION OF THAE IMPACT OF HIGRER OIL&#13;
PRICES ON THE GROWTH OF THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIESI&#13;
10 Background&#13;
The construction of the SIMRICH model/43 was motivated by the need to&#13;
evaluate the widespread feeling that the sharp increase in energy prices might&#13;
substantially reduce the rate of growth of developed countries.     From the point&#13;
of view of developing countries, such a slow^down would reduce the rate of growth&#13;
of world demand for their exports, and make it difficult to finance the imports&#13;
required by their growing economies0      It was therefore essential to try to&#13;
estimate this impact.&#13;
Higher oil prices may affect developed countries in two ways, which are&#13;
reflected by two quite different sets of mecnanisms0       The suddenness of the&#13;
increase will be a cause of disequilibrium, by perturbing aggzegate demand and&#13;
upsetting capital markets.     These disequilibyrium impacts have been discussed&#13;
previously./44   The emphasis in this chapter is on the analysis of the lengthy&#13;
adjustment process of the capital stock of developed countries exposed to a sharp&#13;
and sudden increase in the price of energy.&#13;
The energy price impact is too large to be studied in isolation: The&#13;
repercussions extend to the whole economy and must be examined in a general&#13;
equilibrium context0   In addition to direct impacts on the energy sector ;and on&#13;

energy-consuming industries in developed countries, it is necessary to take into&#13;
account the impacts on saving and capital imports, on wages, and on the rate of&#13;
return of capital and the length of life of capital goods.&#13;
The adjustment process triggered by the increase in energy prices would&#13;
be lengthy.   As a result of the price change, energy users would find themselves&#13;
impelled to replace energy-intensive capital goods by goods which used less&#13;
energy per unit of output; energy producers would find it profitable to develop&#13;
resources  of energy which were not profitable before the price increase.          A&#13;
dynamic growth model was required to study this long, drawn-out adjustment&#13;
process.&#13;
II. The SIMRICH Global Framework&#13;
The global framework of SIMRICH was similar to that of the SIMLINK&#13;
model.   Like the latter model, SIMRICH distinguished three regions in the world&#13;
economy: oil-exporting countries, developing countries, and developed market&#13;
economies.   The key difference was that the model emphasized relations between&#13;
developed and oil-exporting countries rather than between developing countries&#13;
and the rest of the world.    In SIMRICH, oil-exporting countries set the relative&#13;
price of energy production and consumption in other regions.       The oil-exporting&#13;
countries adjusted their imports to their foreign exchange receipts with a fairly&#13;
lengthy lag, which reflected the lack of absorptive capacity of a number of them.&#13;
Developing countries trade primary commodities and manufactures against&#13;
the exports of developed countries at terms of trade which were thought of as&#13;
independent of the level of energy prices.     Their imports were equal to the sum&#13;
of their exports of their net capital imports from the rest of the world&#13;
(including foreign aid), so that their balance of payments was thought to remain&#13;
in equilibrium.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
Developed countries, finally, served as a capital market to the rest of&#13;
the world; in particular, they absorbed the capital exports of the oil-exporting&#13;
countries, and used these to close the deficit of their balance of paymentso/45&#13;
Methodology&#13;
As the goal was to study the impact on the economy of a major price&#13;
change, it was felt that the model constructed should be basea on a careful&#13;
analysis  of   the  equilibrium  behavior  of   a  growing  economy.    SIMRICH was&#13;
accordingly strongly influenced by the neo'classical analysis of the growth of&#13;
market economies.    It, of course, differed from most other models described in&#13;
the literature in being quantitative, and more complex in structure than&#13;
theoretical models0/46&#13;
Models of this type are well suited to study the impact of the disequi-&#13;
librium aspects of economic behavior.      We e^were interested in the following of&#13;
these:/47&#13;
(a)  OPEC's fixing of energy prices was, of course, the primary focus,&#13;
as the main goal was to examine how serious the impact of energy&#13;
prices was on potential growth of developed countrieso&#13;
/45 This feature of the model turned out not to be wholly realistic: o!1=&#13;
exporting countries have directed a certain amount of foreign aid to&#13;
developing countries0     Furthermore, there is reason to think that it is&#13;
partly the accumulation of OPEC surpluses in the developed countries which&#13;
has enabled OECD banks to extend very large Eurodollar credits to developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
/46 There are, of course, other neo-classical quantitative growth models, the&#13;
earliest being the well-known Johansen model (1960).       Some recent examples&#13;
are Hudson and Jorgenson (1971), and Adelman and Robinson (1376)o&#13;
/47 The term "disequlibrium behavior" is used here merely to characterize&#13;
behavior which is not consistent with the assumptions of the theory of&#13;
general equilibrium under perfect competition0     There is no implication that&#13;
disequilibrium behavior is per se better or worse than equilibrium behavior0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
(b) It also appeared worthwhile to assess the impact of energy price&#13;
policies in developed countries on their oil imports and GNP,&#13;
particularly where these policies were designed to keep domestic&#13;
prices of energy below or above the world level.&#13;
(c) Because of the suddenness of the increase of energy prices, it was&#13;
not possible to open up new sources of energy sequentially -        as&#13;
would be the case in a situation of equilibrium - with low-cost&#13;
sources being fully developed before higher-cost sources are opened&#13;
up. In practice, the increase in supply involved a range of alter-&#13;
native energy sources with widely varying costs.&#13;
(d)- OPEC countries adjusted their imports to their exports only&#13;
gradually; as a result, they accumulated large foreign exchange&#13;
balances,   a  substantial  part   of  which  was   invested  in  OECD&#13;
countries.&#13;
(e) The return on such balances was kept below the equilibrium level by&#13;
inflation and by corporate taxes. As a result, the return on these&#13;
balances was far below the marginal productivity of capital in&#13;
developed countries.&#13;
Choice of Coefficients and Assumptions&#13;
We did not try to estimate the coefficients of the SIMRICH model, but&#13;
instead chose to use values suggested by the judgment of experts or by other&#13;
econometric studies.   This approach to choosing coefficients was inspired by the&#13;
practice followed by builders of many programming planning models. The OECD 1974&#13;
energy study played a particularly important role by guiding the choice of&#13;
coefficients of the energy supply and demand functions.     By the time the SIMRICH&#13;
was built, it had become apparent that this study had overstated the probable&#13;
increase of domestic energy output in OECD countries and the sensitivity of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
demand to prices, and this fact was taken into account in our t£3rk.     The choice&#13;
of the consumption function was based on a survey of available econcmic studies,&#13;
while the import functions of OPEC countries were chosen so as to be consistent&#13;
with World Bank projections of thefr imports.     The choice of p-.ice elasticities&#13;
of demand for energy was based on the judgment of experts; here econometric&#13;
estimates  could   provide  little  gu:ldance,  since  the  estimation  period  was&#13;
characterized by a very stable energy price level.     A crucial, parameter was the&#13;
15 percent rate of return on capital assumed to prevail in all sectors of the&#13;
economies of devloped countries in 1973,   This uas based on a survey of estimates&#13;
reported in the projects analysis lilerature0   The figure is slightly higher than&#13;
that arrived at by M. Feldstein (1977) on the basis of a similar survey. Another&#13;
crucial parameter - the 4 percent per year growith of labor productivity -&#13;
reflected historical experience0&#13;
III. Description of the Model&#13;
An Analysis of Inputs and Outputs&#13;
The developed countries submodel is more detailed than those for the&#13;
other two regions0   It is convenient to start the description of the model by its&#13;
input/output structure0 This is represented in Table 32.&#13;
In the Table, the various goods and services are represented by the&#13;
rows; the agents, by the columns0     A "+" indicates that the column sector is a&#13;
source of the good; a "-", that it is a user0    Sectors uhlch neither produce nor&#13;
consume a good, or whose production or consumption of that good is constant, are&#13;
designated by a zero0&#13;

The  market  structure  is accordingly   very  simple.    Primary  energy,&#13;
supplied by OPEC and by domestic energy producers, is used only by the energy&#13;
transformation sector (electricity production, oil refining, etc.).     Transformed&#13;
energy is bought only by the other goods sector.         Other goods are sold to&#13;
domestic final users, and to the rest of the world. This is a stark simplication&#13;
of reality, which neglects minor feedbacks represented, e.g., by the primary&#13;
sector-s input of other goods or of transformed energy.    Likewise, we merged the&#13;
consumption of energy of households with that of other sectors.      Primary energy&#13;
production and energy transformation were assumed to require a fixed amount of&#13;
labor.   For the sake of simplicity, the different types of energy and of other&#13;
goods were aggregated.    This is valid if the prices of goods in each category&#13;
move together, which, of course, is only approximately true.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
134&#13;
The Pricing of Energy&#13;
The relative price of imported oil was set exogenously by OPEC width&#13;
respect to the price of other goods, the numeraire in the model.      This assumad&#13;
perfect cohesion of OPECo    It is probable that these pricing decisions of oil-&#13;
exporting countries were not independent of oil sales, and that if these sales&#13;
dropped  too much, the cartel might even boreak down0      We dli   not take this&#13;
possibility into account in this study, because too little was knowm about hoe-&#13;
oil prices might have responded to sales changes. Tentative experiments with the&#13;
model suggested that changing this feature of tne model would have had a large&#13;
impact on some of the conclusions, cspecially on those which referred to the&#13;
impact  of  protection  of domestic   energy  sources  on GNP   of the   developed&#13;
countries.&#13;
The governments of developece countries anere reluctant- to increase the&#13;
price of domestically produced energy as much as that of imported oil0         Tne&#13;
reluctance was particularly great in countries such as the United States and&#13;
Canada which had large sources of low--cost, domestically produced energy.    This&#13;
was represented in the model by assuming a lagged response of the price of&#13;
domestically produced primary energy to wYoTld prices0  In the base case solution,&#13;
this price, PSUB, was adjusted to the world price (POIL) accordi-g to:&#13;
PSUB = (POIL)°5 (PSUB-1)05                             (:)&#13;
But it w-as clear that other responses might be assumed, and that in&#13;
simulating the model over the past, it wyas appropriate to drop this equation and&#13;
to substitute instead the observed price path of energy0&#13;
The base case equation assumed that the price of domzstically produced&#13;
energy eventually caught up with the world price0    Political pressures might in&#13;
fact have kept it permanently below the wyorld level0   Alternatively, the desire&#13;
to achieve energy independence appeared to have led some countries to protect&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
domestically produced energy to the point of raising its price above the world&#13;
level.   Such policies could be simulated by modifying equation (1) to reflect a&#13;
price discount on domestically produced energy, or a tariff reflecting the&#13;
protection granted to domestically produced energy.&#13;
The other goods sector used transformed, not primary, energy; and the&#13;
margin between the two energy prices was considerable.         Our estimate of the&#13;
transformation margin was based on estimates by the staff of Shell -Oil, who&#13;
updated an OECD study for an earlier year for Western Europe.      We adjusted these&#13;
figures to cover North America and Japan, to obtain a transformation margin of&#13;
$10.69 per barrel in 1973.&#13;
This figure included both net indirect taxes, and the value added by&#13;
sectors such as electricity generation and distribution, and the distribution and&#13;
refining of oil.   We took the view that the tax component, in fact, covered the&#13;
cost of infrastructure investment in roads, and the antipollution and other&#13;
investments required to offset the environmental costs of energy consumption.&#13;
This implied a broad definition of the transformation sector to include these&#13;
activities.&#13;
The price of transformed energy (PEN) was assumed to adjust with a lag&#13;
to changes in the world price:&#13;
PEN = (POIL + 10.69)-5 PEN'5                            (2)&#13;
In addition to the lagged adjustment of domestic to world prices, there&#13;
was a further delay in the adjustment of energy supply and demand as a result of&#13;
a lagged reaction of the expected prices which guided investment decisions.       We&#13;
assumed that these prices could be decribed by a simple moving average:&#13;
PSUB  = (PSUB + PSUB    + PSUB    / 3                  (3)&#13;
PEN  = (PEN + PEN    (+ PEN    /3                      (4)&#13;
-1     EN2)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
136 -&#13;
The Price Response of the Domestic Supply of Primary Energy&#13;
The OECD and other studies of prospects for increasing the domestic&#13;
supply of primary energy in developed countries point to the considerable&#13;
differences in the costs of different types of energyo It is the price of energy&#13;
-which determines the energy sources which are worth exploiting - from North Sea&#13;
oil as a relatively low-cost source, up to very costly sources such as oil shale&#13;
and synthetic oilo&#13;
Another crucial characteristic of energy supply is the length of time&#13;
needed to develop a particular energy source.      Ideally, it would be desirable to&#13;
open up energy resources in sequence, starting from the cheapest ones and ending&#13;
with the most expensive.    In practice, this would be too slow: Any rapid increase&#13;
of supply requires parallel development of both low- and a higher-cost sources of&#13;
energy.&#13;
These ideas inspired the specification of the energy supply function.&#13;
This assumed that prices determined what deposits are worth opening up; but it&#13;
was the rate of increase and not the level of output which depended on prices.&#13;
Such a specification, which recognized the long periods required to open up new&#13;
sources of energy, was appropriate in a model meant for simulation over an ll1&#13;
year period0    It would, of course, not be appropriate if the model was to be&#13;
used, as other models have been, to study the future well into the next century0&#13;
The  specification   set  out  to  investigate  what wouid   have  been  the&#13;
increase in supply if prices had remained at the 1973 level; it then examined the&#13;
implication of higher prices0    Equation (5) specified the annual growth of energy&#13;
production  if prices   had  remained at the 1973 levelo        The assumed constant&#13;
increase of 1753 million barrels (equivalent to about 3.7 percent per year)&#13;
represented 85 percent of the increase in the OECD's (1974) base case forecast;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
the 15 percent scaling down of this forecast reflected our belief that it was too&#13;
optimistic.&#13;
ASUB = 1.753&#13;
The investment cost of creating this extra capacity was calculated on&#13;
the basis of a capital at the 1973 price./48      Energy production can be increased&#13;
more rapidly than the rate implied by      ASUB  only at a rising capital cost.     We&#13;
assumed that the capital cost per unit of additional capacity (CAPCO) increased&#13;
linearly with the increase in investment:&#13;
CAPCO = 5.91 + f (ASUB+3 - ASUB     )                     (6)&#13;
where "f" was a calibration parameter, the choice of which determined how&#13;
strongly the capital coefficient increased as the increase of domestic energy&#13;
output accelerated. This is discussed below. Investment (VSUB) was then:&#13;
VSUB = 5.91 ASUB+3 + CAPCO (ASUB+3 - ASUB     )         (7)&#13;
Equations (6) and (7) together implicitly define a production function&#13;
relating the output SUB to increases in the capital stock; they took a gestation&#13;
lag of three years into account.&#13;
Profit maximization implies equality between the marginal cost of&#13;
increasing production capacity and the expected return. Hence, taking the three-&#13;
year gestation lag into account:&#13;
/48  The base year price was $3.21 per barrel.      Since investment was measured in&#13;
billions of dollars per year and output in millions of barrels per day, and&#13;
since we assumed a three-year construction lag, the capital coefficient was&#13;
give  by(0.365) (3.21)&#13;
given by (0.15) (1.15)2 = 5.91, where (0.365) (3.21) was the value of output&#13;
from a well of one barrel per day capacity; (0.365) (3.21) was the value of&#13;
0.15&#13;
the capital required for a producing well of 1 barrel per day capacity; and&#13;
(0.365) (3.21   was the value of a 1 barrel per day well which has just been&#13;
(0.15) (1.15)&#13;
dug and will start producing after three years.&#13;

It is interesting to note that equation (9) implies that the increase in&#13;
energy output is a function of the interest rate as well as of the price of&#13;
energy.   This, of course, reflects the fact that the profitabiiLty of developing&#13;
new energy sources depends on the cost of capital as xe^ll as on the price of&#13;
energy.    The  interest  rate twas an endogenous    variable,  beirg   determined by&#13;
developments in the other good secto:? (see section "f" below)0      'This turned out&#13;
to be a significant mechanism in the model0       Introducing (9) into (6), w^-e find&#13;

increase in domestic production of energy and its price0 Its value was&#13;
chosen to ensure that the difference between the energy output attained&#13;

Energy Transformation&#13;
Primary energy was transformed into final energy by a single technique,&#13;
which used only capital, and neither labor nor inputs of other goods.           As&#13;
explained above, the transformation sector was defined broadly to include all&#13;
activities involved in making energy available to users, i.e., it included&#13;
infrastructure investment in roads and investment required for pollution abate-&#13;
ment as well as energy transformation in the narrow sense of the term.     On the&#13;
polluters pay" principle, SIMRICH considered taxes on energy as payment for the&#13;
public investment connected with energy consumption.&#13;
Value added (in constant prices) was given by multiplying output by the&#13;
base year value of the transformation margin./51&#13;
TRAN = 3.90 EN                                         (11)&#13;
Investment in the sector was determined by applying to output increases&#13;
a constant capital coefficient. This was consistent with the assumed 15 percent&#13;
base year rate of return./52&#13;
VTRAN = 26.01 (TRAN - TRAN_1)                          (12)&#13;
Production Function and Choice of Techniques in the Other Goods Sector&#13;
The analysis of energy demand in the model involved a sharp distinction&#13;
between two types of adjustment. In the short run, the scope for energy conser-&#13;
/51 Again a correction for difference in units is needed: the base year margin&#13;
is $10.69 per barrel per day, so that converting to billions of dollars per&#13;
year gives 10.69 x 0.365 = 3.90.&#13;
/52  It is readily checked that 3.90 = (0.15) (26.01).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

vation is quite limited, as the consumption of energy is narrowly conditioned by&#13;
the characteristics of the existing capital stoclk0    Even if a large car is run&#13;
economically, it will use more energy than a small model.     In the same way, the&#13;
energy required to heat homes or to operate factories is heavl y dependent on&#13;
their design.&#13;
The situation is quite different in the long run. Comparisons of energy&#13;
consumption per unit of GNP between countries indicate that the energy intensity&#13;
of output is substantially lower in countries where energy prices have been high&#13;
for a long time than in countries -ihere they have been low0     Tnese differences&#13;
are explained by pervasive differences in the organization of production and&#13;
everday life.   To illustrate the argument by an example from e-ferday life, not&#13;
only are European automobiles smaller and operated with more efficient engines,&#13;
but European cities are also more densely populated, and their public transport&#13;
networks are more widespread and are used more intensively by the population.&#13;
An increase in energy prices therefore evokes a long, drawn-out response&#13;
by stimulating a broad adaptation of the capital stoclk and of the organization of&#13;
the economy.    Adjustment is a complex process, which involves not only the&#13;
replacement of existing machines by equipment which uses less energy, but changes&#13;
in habits and technical innovations0&#13;
It was felt that this long, drawn-out adaptation could be best modeled&#13;
by assuming that after the rise in energy prices, investors would select capital&#13;
goods which differed from those which they purchased when these prices w-ere&#13;
lower.   These capital goods would be more energy efficient thaa the latter, but&#13;
they would cost more per unit of output; it was the rise in energy prices which&#13;
made them more profitable than the old capital goods0&#13;
These ideas were implemented by specifying an ex ante production&#13;
function in which investors could choose a combination of energy, labor, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
capital at the time of investment, and ex post production functions, with much&#13;
less substitutability, to which they were restricted once that decision has been&#13;
taken.&#13;
The choices open to firms are represented in Figure 7, which describes a&#13;
two-factor production function consistent with the ideas just set out.         In the&#13;
diagram the curve EA described the techniques between which firms could choose ex&#13;
ante at the time of investment.      If the prices of energy and of capital were in&#13;
the ratio described by the isocost curve Il, then the technique selected by the&#13;
firm would be T1.&#13;
If the price of energy suddenly increased, yielding the isocost curve&#13;
I2, the new investment of firms would take the form of capital goods of tye T2.&#13;
There was, however, less scope for substitution of capital for energy on the&#13;
capital goods bought before the price increase: the more restricted range of&#13;
substitution for the goods was described by the ex post curve EP1, the profit-&#13;
maximizing point for this old equipment being Ti.&#13;
The ex post substitution possibilities for technique T are likewise&#13;
described by curve EP2.       It was clearly assumed that such an ex post curve&#13;
existed   for  every  point  of  EA.    Each  of  these  was   tangent  to EA,   which&#13;
accordingly was the envelope of the set of EP curves.&#13;
The approach illustrated in the diagram had important implications for&#13;
the way energy demand responded     to a price change in the model.        The energy&#13;
intensity on the capital stock existing at the time of a price increase could&#13;
only be adjusted from T1 to Ti, whereas new investment would be in technique T2,&#13;
which was more capital-and less energy-intensive.       The immediate effect of the&#13;
price increase was a drop in the energy use per unit of output from el to ej.&#13;
The sector's average energy use would, however, be a weighted average of ej and&#13;
e2, with the weight of e2 increasing over time as old capital was scrapped and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
the stock of new capital (of type T2) increased.         Hence energy demand in the&#13;
model depended on past investments as reflected in the composition of the capital&#13;
stock.    The speed of adjustment     to the higher price depended on the amount&#13;
invested in the sector.    This feature distinguished SIMRICH from approaches which&#13;
related energy demand to output and price levels with fixed coefficients and took&#13;
the past into account only by specifying a distributed lag structure.         Implicit&#13;
in the model was a distributed lags, but its coefficients were not constant but&#13;
endogenously determined by investment behavior over time0&#13;

The  mathematical   specification   used   in  SIMRICH  was   slightly  more&#13;
complicated than the mechanism illustrated in the diagram, because it reflected&#13;
the role of labor as a factor of production in addition to that of energy and&#13;
capital0 The specification was as follows0&#13;
To simplify the algebra,x we only considered substitution possibilities&#13;
between energy and capital, assuming that labor and capital were joint factors of&#13;
production: the number of workers per unit of capital was independent of the&#13;

choice of technique and changed only as a result of (exogenous) productivity&#13;
growth.&#13;
The ex ante substitution possibilities between capital and energy were&#13;
defined by a CES production function:&#13;
OTH? = (a.VOTHT   + b.ENTc)   1/c                                   (13)&#13;
T      ~~T&#13;
where OTH, VOTH, and EN were output of other goods, capital, and energy&#13;
use;   T    denoted the vintage; and the substitution chosen (s = 1/(1 + c).       The&#13;
ex ante elasticity of substitution chosen (s = 0.6) made possible a reduction of&#13;
8 percent of the average energy intensity of production by 1985.            (On newly&#13;
invested capital goods, the reduction is 14 percent.) This choice of coefficient&#13;
was guided by the estimates in the OECD energy forecasts that the upper limit of&#13;
possible energy saving was in the 10- to 15 percent range.       The coefficients "a"&#13;
and "b" were derived from the share of energy and other costs in the sector in&#13;
1973./53   The entrepreneur who invested at time "t" selected a point on the ex&#13;
ante production function by maximizing the present value of expected profits over&#13;
the machines's lifetime.    Since labor use per unit of capital was independent of&#13;
the choice of technique, and since we assumed that the entrepreneur expected the&#13;
/53 The model assumed that the equipment available prior to 1973 was homogenous&#13;
with respect to factor intensities, and could be handled as a single&#13;
vintage.   The profit maximization conditions (14) and (15) below, adapted&#13;
for this initial vintage, could be used to derive "a" and "b" from the 1973&#13;
factor intensities. The formulae were:&#13;
a  =  (share   of  non-energy   input  in  value   of  output)  x  1973  capital&#13;
coefficient)c, and&#13;
b = (share of energy in value of output) x 1973 energy input per unit of&#13;
output)c,&#13;
where the capital coefficient was derived from the equilibrium growth&#13;
assumption that the return on capital equaled the sum of profits over a 25-&#13;
year lifetime of the investment, discounted at 15 percent per year.&#13;

equivalent to maximizing current profits.&#13;
Partial differentiation of (13) with respect to En , and equating the&#13;
e&#13;
marginal product of consumed energy to the expected energy price PEW , gave&#13;
EN* / OTH* = (b/PEN (T) )                                           (14)&#13;

Once a machine has been installed, ex post substitution possibilities&#13;
were again given by a CES function:&#13;
OTH (t) = (a   VCTH     a  EN-)1/y                                    (16)&#13;
with substitution elasticity     a   1/(1 + Y)o         The model assumed an ex post&#13;
elasticity of 0015, which was consiscent with econometric estimates of the demand&#13;
for energy.&#13;
It was clear that if the price expectation were realized, the profit-&#13;
maximizing factor intensities had to be the same on the ex ante and ex post&#13;
production functions.    In other words, the ex ante and ex post isoquants had to&#13;
be tangential at the point   (VOTHI/OTH*, EN*/OTH*)    which defined the ex ante choice&#13;
of technique.&#13;
/54 This was not correct, since the mechanism of the model implied that energy-&#13;
saving equipment had a longer useful life than other equipment0         But this&#13;
effect of the choice of technique on the machine's lifetime was so wealk that&#13;
it could be ignored in the investment decision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

This  implied  two conditions   sufficient  to derive the two unknown parameters aT&#13;
and   T in (16).   Indeed, it must be true that&#13;

Pricing of Labor and Capital&#13;
Wage Determination&#13;
We assumed that labor productivity would increase at its past rate of 4&#13;
percent  per  year.    Then  the most   recent  vintages  would  also be the most&#13;
profitable ones.     The level of wages would determine which of the vintages&#13;
yielded positive or zero profits, and were therefore worth operating, and which&#13;
should  be   scrapped  because  their   operation  would  result   in  losses.    In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
equilibrium, the wage level had to be such that enough vintages wa2re used to&#13;
ensure full employment of the available labor force.&#13;
The labor use LT on machines of vintage T t^was then given oy&#13;
L  = 1-0.04(t-1973) VOTH&#13;
T    e                 T(20)&#13;
where le was the number of workers per unit of capital In 1973.      Only the most&#13;
recent and efficient vintages would be used at any point of time, older vintages&#13;
being scrapped.   If machines of vintage 't" came on stream in year t + 1 and if&#13;
the oldest vintage in use in year "t7' w^as of vintage tl, then total labor demand&#13;
was&#13;

Tt1&#13;
and, given an exogenous projection of the labor force and the full employment&#13;
assumption in the model, this equation enabled us to calculate for each year the&#13;
age of the oldest vintage in use tl./55&#13;
The next step was to calcula2e the corresponding equilibrium wage rate,&#13;
which would be deduced from the condition that profits at the marginal vintage of&#13;
capital were zero.   Given the length of the projection period 1974-85, only pre-&#13;
1973 vintages would be scrapped.     As energy prices were rough:l.y stable before&#13;
1973, these vintages were assumed to use equal amounts of energy per unit of&#13;
/55 Technically it was convenient to treat pre-l973 investment in continuous timeo&#13;

The right-hand side of (21) was then replaced by the sum    Z   Lt correspon-&#13;
1974&#13;
ding to employment of vintages created after the oil price increase, plus&#13;
1973&#13;
an        LTdT  describing employment on older vintages. We assumed that the&#13;
tl&#13;
technical lifetime of capital goods was 25 years and that, before 1973, in-&#13;
vestment grew at a constant rate equal to the observed long-term GDP growth&#13;
range.&#13;

profits on those machines had to be zero at time "t".&#13;

More recent capital goods which were more efficient yielded a positive&#13;
surplus after payment for current inputs.     Capital created before the cutoff data&#13;
t, was scrapped.&#13;
It is interesting to examine further the behavior implied by equations&#13;
(21) and (22).    Because of the assumption that the capital/labor ratio depends&#13;
only on time, equation (21) implies that, in the short run, the scrappage cutoff&#13;
date is independent of the price of energy. This would not be true in the longer&#13;
run, as energy prices influence the level of investment and thereby the economic&#13;
lifetime.    Equations (21) and    (22) imply that any acceleration of investment&#13;
would accelerate scrappage and raise the wage rate, and that any deceleration&#13;
would reduce it.&#13;
According to equation (22), the short-run relation between wages and&#13;
energy prices would depend on the elasticity of substitution between capital and&#13;
energy./56    If this was zero,    then equation (22) defined the wage rate as a&#13;
linear function of the price of energy, as represented by curve c, Figure 8.        If&#13;
it was possible for firms to adjust their energy input to the prices, then the&#13;
wage/energy price relation would be a curve which was convex to the origin, such&#13;
as c2 in the diagram. Three linear factor price frontiers are shown in the&#13;
/56 Remember that in SIMRICH, the capital/labor ratio is assumed to depend only&#13;
on the age of the vintage.&#13;

diagram, the steeper ones corresponding to more recent vintages./57 At an energy&#13;
price P19 the wage rate would be Wi.      if the price now rose to P29 the economic&#13;
lifetime of machines would initially remain unaffected.        Hence, the wage rate&#13;
dropped  to W2,   or,  recognizing   substitutability,   to W30     But  the economic&#13;
lifetime (tl) was dependent on the energy price only in the short run.      Scrappage&#13;
in the model depended on the level of investment in the other goods sector, which&#13;
was related in a complicated way to t-ie energy price. The latter influenced both&#13;
savings and capital flows from abroad (the accumulation of petro- dollars) as well&#13;
as investment in the primary energy and energy transformation sectors.           These&#13;
variables determined investment in the other goods sector (which was derived&#13;
residually); hence scrappage, the age of the marginal vintage and therefore,&#13;
finally, the wage rate.&#13;
If the effect of the price rise was to increase investment in the&#13;
sector, more recent vintages would have to be scrapped (t, rises): in terms of&#13;
the  diagram,  the  factor   price  line  swings  from AB1   to AB20    This   further&#13;
mitigates the pressure on the wage rate: it now falls only to W40/58&#13;
/57  The line AB gives the frontier for 1973 machines0        The three lines all go&#13;
through A because this point is given by PEN = OTH     ENt1 and since we assume&#13;
that pre-1974 machines differ only in labor proLuctivity, this gives the&#13;
same point (for all t1 1973).&#13;

Determination of the Interest Rate&#13;
Whereas in the model the wage rate was determined by the characteristics&#13;
of the marginal vintage, the characteristics of the newest machine determined the&#13;
interest rate. We assumed that the interest rate was at its equilibrium value in&#13;
the sense that it was equal to the internal rate of return on the latest&#13;
vintage. Discounting profits (value added minus the wage bill) over the economic&#13;
lifetime of a machine gave for vintage T (assumed to be scrapped in year tl(T ))&#13;

We had to make a number of assumptions in order to be able to use zhis&#13;
equation  to calculate   the  interest   Zate./59   We assumed    that  investors had&#13;
rational expectations9 i.e., they correctly antlicipated the energy price and the&#13;
wage rate they would have to pay over the capital goods lifetime as well as that&#13;
lifetime itself./60&#13;
The interest rate thus deternined had an important effect on the choice&#13;
of technique in energy production9     since there were long cons-ruction lags      .n&#13;
that sector.    A lower interest rate would induce additional energy output, and&#13;
the model's results suggest that this effect was of some importa-nce (see Section&#13;
IV below).&#13;
It is important to realize that different profit rates are realized on&#13;
different  vintages0     Profits  are maximal when    the machine   is new and    then&#13;
decreases over time as the wage rate rises until profits are recuced to zero and&#13;
the machine is scrapped.     The assumption of rational expectations allowed us to&#13;
assume  that the internal rate of return calculated       from this t-me-profile of&#13;
profit  is the   interest  rate0    Herce9  the interest rate depends on (a) the&#13;
production  function (which determines energy and labor use a-id the extent to&#13;
/59  As it turns out, this effect was fairly important: ewnereLs the substitu-&#13;
tability reduced the fall in the wage rate projected oy tie model only from&#13;
4.3 percent to 4.1 percent9 the projected decrease in the economic lifetime&#13;
further reduced it to 3.4 percent0    See section IV belowo&#13;
/60  Technically9 this meant that tae model had to be run far beyond the 1974-85&#13;
projection period.   This gave us the value of t,(1977) anc the time paths of&#13;
PEN and W.    We then used equation (22) to cafculate thLe. ex post internal&#13;
rate of returno   Call this r 1   Since we assumed rational expectations9 this&#13;
should also be the rate of -i-iterest0     B-ut to derive t, (1977), we had to&#13;
assume a rate of interest9     say r90    This introduced a problem of simul-&#13;
taneity: a change in the value of r2 would affect investment in the other&#13;
goods sector0    Hence9 the chc9ce of r2 affected scrappage and thereby the&#13;
wage rate and the value of t,'l977)9 both of which affecz r10        We iterated&#13;

which these can be adjusted), (b) the energy price, (c) the wage rate, and (d)&#13;
the expected lifetime of the most recent vintage (which, as we have noted,&#13;
indirectly depends on the interest rate itself).&#13;
In summary, three effects of a change in the energy price were modelled&#13;
for  the  other   goods  sector:  first,   a  change  towards  less  energy-intensive&#13;
techniques (a movement along the ex ante production function for new machines);&#13;
second, a change in the economic lifetime of machines; and third, a change in&#13;
factor prices.&#13;
Interest During Construction&#13;
A second refinement in the model, which turned out to be of some&#13;
significance,   concerned  the  treatment   of  interest  during  construction.     We&#13;
assumed that the value of capital goods with a gestation period'of a year or more&#13;
grew by "r" percent per year.      For the transformation sector, no gestation lag&#13;
was assumed; the instantaneous output was then offset by an "r" percent charge.&#13;
Hence, we added to GDP and subtracted from total investment a term:&#13;
r(l + r) VSUBt-2 + rVSUBt 1 - rVTRAN = rUNF&#13;
Note that for the other goods sector, where a gestation lag of one year&#13;
was assumed, no such adjustment is needed.&#13;
National Accounts&#13;
The consumption function was&#13;
CONS = 0.53GNP + 0.33CONS_1                                         (23)&#13;
Total investment then followed from the GDP identity given a resource&#13;
surplus - ZACC - FSR + FSE:&#13;
V = GDP - CONS - INV -AACC - FSR + FSE + (POIL - POIL)MOIL         (24)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152&#13;
where INV stands for increase in stocks, defined by:&#13;
INV   002(GDP - GDP1)                                             (25)&#13;
Investment in the other goods sector was determined residually:&#13;
VOTH = V -VSUB - VTRAN - Lr(l + r)VSUBt-2 + rVSUBt-      rX1TRANj  (26)&#13;
Total energy use and output of other goods were given by summation over&#13;
all vintages actually in use:&#13;
t-1&#13;
EN =  E    EN (t)                                                 (27)&#13;
T=t1&#13;
t-1&#13;
OTH =        O 0TH T(t)                                           (28)&#13;
T=t1&#13;
Oil imports now followed from the material balance:&#13;
EN = SUB + MOIL                                                   (29)&#13;
GDP consisted of value added in each of the three sectors plus the value&#13;
of interest during construction (rUNF):&#13;
GDP* = (OTH - PEN OEN) + (PENo    POIL )EN + FOIL oSUB&#13;
= OTH - POIL o0MIL                                           (30)&#13;
GDP = GDP* + r(l + r)VSUBt2 + rVSUBtI      rVTRAN - GDP:: + rUNF  (31)&#13;
GNP = GDP - FSR + FSE                                             (32)&#13;
(where FSR and FSE stand for factor service receipts and earnings of oil&#13;
producers).&#13;
Balance of Payments&#13;
As shown above, total investment in the economy w^as derived residually&#13;
from the expenditure identity.    Hence, it remained to derive the current account&#13;
surplus.   For this purpose the model distinguished, in addition to developed and&#13;
oil-exporting countries, a third group of countries, the developing ones.      These&#13;
countries were assumed to be in balance-of-payments equilibrium in the aggregate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -&#13;
There were, then, seven trade flows among these three groups of countries.&#13;
a. oil exports from OPEC to OECD (POIL.MOIL)&#13;
b. oil exports from OPEC to LDCs (POIL.MLDC)&#13;
c. (gross) exports of other goods (manufactured exports) from OPEC to&#13;
the OECD (MANEX1)&#13;
d. (net) exports of other goods from OPEC to LDCs (MANEX2)&#13;
e. imports of other goods by OPEC from the OECD (ABS1)&#13;
f. imports of other goods by OPEC from the LDCs (ABS2)&#13;
g. net exports of other goods from LDCs to the OECD&#13;
The volume of the first flow was determined by the model; the next three&#13;
flows were forecast exogenously; the last flow followed from the assumption that&#13;
LDCs were in balance-of-payments equilibrium.     Hence, total net OECD exports of&#13;
other goods were defined by:&#13;
EXPOTH = ABS - MANEX - MANEX2 - POIL.MLDC&#13;
We assumed that OPEC imports, ABS, were determined by a distributed lag&#13;
on OPEC's foreign exchange receipts (XANGE):&#13;
XANGE = POIL.MOIL + POIL.MLCD + MANEXI + MANEX2 + FSR - FSE&#13;
14&#13;
ABS = E C.XANGE&#13;
i=O       t-i&#13;
where the coefficients of the distributed lag were .200, .104, .097, .090, .082,&#13;
.074, .066, .059, .052, .045, .039, .033, .027, .023, .011.      This specification&#13;
implied a rather slow adjustment process: it would take six years before imports&#13;
adjusted to only half of an initial increase in revenues.&#13;
Factor service receipcs, were projected assuming an average real rate of&#13;
return on oil exporters' foreign assets of 2 percent:&#13;
FSR = 0.02ACC 1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 154&#13;
where assets are defined by:&#13;
ACC   ACC-1 + XANGE - ABSo&#13;
Hence, the OECD resource surplus is equal to&#13;
EXPOTH - POILoI&#143;OIL =   (AACC   FSR = FSE)&#13;
Gross national savings (corrected for the terms-of£trade loss) are:&#13;
SAV   GDP   CONS   FSN + (POIL    POIL )MIL&#13;
- GNP   (FOIL - POIL )MOIL - CONS&#13;
and, by definition:&#13;
V + INV - SAV + CAPIMP&#13;
where CAPIMP are capital imports (XA-\GE - ABS = AACC).&#13;
IV. Results 61&#13;
Short-Run Effects&#13;
The model was run under two price assumptions, one corresponding to thne&#13;
1973 price ($3o21 per barrel), the other to      the early 1975 price ($8319 per&#13;
barrel in 1973 prices).     The short-run effect of the price increase can be&#13;
measured by comparing the two versions for 1974.      The only effect operating in&#13;
that year was the ex post substitution away from energy on the existing capital&#13;
stock: increased investment in doiestic energy production and investment ln less&#13;
energy-intensive techniques in the other goods sector could Teduce the terms-of-&#13;
trade loss in the initial year because of the assumed gestat:1on lags.    Given the&#13;
low value of the ex post substitiition elasticity (o.15), the difference between&#13;
the two cases in the level of oil imports is very small. Even if domestic prices&#13;

were adjusted instantaneously, oil imports dropped by only 3.44 million barrels a&#13;
day, or 12.9 percent.    In this case, the terms-of-trade loss was $48.50 billion&#13;
if measured at the $3.21 level of imports, $41.69 billion if measured at the new&#13;
level.    As a result of the price increase,      the domestic product    (at current&#13;
prices) dropped by $44.92 billion, or 1.5 percent.       The fact that this GDP loss&#13;
was smaller than the terms-of-trade loss measured at the $3.21 level of imports&#13;
reflected the ability of the economy to adjust its pattern of energy consumption&#13;
to  the  new  price.    This   "flexibility  effect"  was   $48.50  -  $44.92  = 3.58&#13;
billion.   Similarly, the fact that the GDP loss was larger than the terms-of-&#13;
trade  loss  measured  at  the new price level of imports reflected        the import&#13;
substitution cost of reducing imports to the new level.        This "import substitu-&#13;
tion cost" was $44.92 - $41.69 - $3.23 billion.&#13;
Any delay in adjusting domestic to world prices would lead to a waste of&#13;
resources.    This effect   could be measured by using the lagged adjustment of&#13;
equation (2) instead of the instantaneous adjustment (PEN = POIL + 10.69).          In&#13;
this case, the domestic price rose by only $2.3 in 1974, compared to a world&#13;
price increase of $15.     In this case, the domestic product dropped to only .93&#13;
billion more than in the case of full price adjustment.        This loss, a mere 0.03&#13;
percent of GNP, was negligible; it was also transitory and vanished as soon as&#13;
the domestic price was fully adjusted.&#13;
Dynamic Effects of the Price Increase&#13;
The main results of the simulations for the two cases are given below.&#13;
They imply that, if oil prices remained at the level of early 1975 (in real&#13;
terms), oil imports of OECD countries would continue to grow until 1985 but much&#13;
more slowly than if prices had not increased. Oil producers would increase their&#13;
foreign assets rapidly until 1980, more slowly thereafter.       Under the higher oil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
156 -&#13;
price, OECD energy production exceeded iy 17.3 percent the level w-ihich would have&#13;
been reached had the oil price remaiaei constant; energy demand wms 1003 percent&#13;
lower.&#13;
The effects of the price inc-:ease on groWth can be decomposed into a&#13;
change  in the supply    of funds   (savings)  and a change in the efficiency of&#13;
investment.   Gross national savings (incluciing ne. factor service income and the&#13;
terms-of-trade loss) were $146 billion lower over the 1974-84 period at the&#13;
higher oil price.   This was, however, miore than offset by higher capital imports,&#13;
i.e., by the investment by oil producers of o.i revenues in the OECDo        The net&#13;
result was that savings were slightly ($46 billion, or about one-half of one&#13;
percent) higher.&#13;
To  evaluate   the  changes   in  the  efficiency   of  investment,  it   is&#13;
convenient to use a two-sector analysis:&#13;

b. ex post substitution of capital for energy;&#13;
c. changes in the economic lifetime of machines;&#13;
d. changes in factor prices.&#13;
Without either ex ante or ex post substitutability, energy demand would&#13;
have been 116.67 million barrels per day.    Hence, energy use per unit of output&#13;
was 9.2 percent lower than it would have been without a change in technique.     By&#13;
1985, the value of oil imports thus saved was $32 billion (in 1973 prices). The&#13;
reduction was a weighted average of 15 percent drop in energy use by machines&#13;
which are optimal at the higher oil price compared to the 1973 energy use and a&#13;
movement along the various ex post isoquants.     The latter effect varied from 4&#13;
percent for the machines existing in 1973 to 0 percent for the very last&#13;
machines, installed when price expectations were fully adjusted to the higher&#13;
price level.   Of the total reduction in energy use resulting from substitution&#13;
(10.68 million barrels per day), 77 percent was due to a movement along the ex&#13;
ante curve (8.19 mb/d); the remaining 2.49 mb/d reflected ex post substitution,&#13;
mostly (2.12 mb/d) on the capital stock existing in 1973).&#13;
The effect of the price increase on the economic lifetime of capital&#13;
goods was small.   Investment in the other goods sector was higher and was in less&#13;
energy-intensive (i.e., in more labor-intensive, since capital and labor are&#13;
complementary)  techniques.    Hence, more labor had    to  be released   from  old&#13;
machines: in the $8.19 case, the economic lifetime was 25.36 years, only 0.8&#13;
percent less than in the $3.21 case (25.56 years).     This small change, however,&#13;
had important implications for the wage rate.    In terms of Figure 8, w, was the&#13;
wage rate in 1985 for the $3.21 case.     We calculated w2 and w3 by keeping the&#13;
economic lifetime constant, raising the oil price and assuming ex post substitu-&#13;
tability only in the latter case; w2 and w3 was 6.73 compared to wl, which is&#13;
7.02. Hence, the price increase alone caused a 4.3 percent drop in the real wage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 &#13;
rate, which was offset to only a very small extent by ex post substitution0 More&#13;
important, however, was the change in the economic lifetime: witn the economic&#13;
lifetime reduced, labor productivity on the vintage to be scrapped was higher;&#13;
hence, the wage rate did not have to drop as far: w4 turned out to be 6.78, or&#13;
only 3.4 percent below w11&#13;
Once the wage rate was determined, the realized rate of return could be&#13;
calculated.     The  lower  wage  rate  and  the   lower  energy  intensity were    not&#13;
sufficient to offset the negative effect of the energy price increase: the rate&#13;
of return dropped from 14.92 percent to 14o18 percent, or by 5 percent.           Given&#13;
our specifications of the energy production sector, this led to a lower capital&#13;
cost and a higher profit-maximizing level of output in that sector.        This effect&#13;
was not trivial: by 1985, ift accounted for l.4 million barrels per day of&#13;
additional domestic energy production.&#13;
The main impact on factor prices was, however, on rent.       WThereas at the&#13;
margin, the rate of return in energy production was equal to the return in the&#13;
other goods sector, all other capital in energy production (which was created&#13;
when oil prices and capital costs were lower) earned a rent.        In 1985, this rent&#13;
was given by:/62&#13;

The rent was, obviously, zero in the $3.21 case0       At the higher price,&#13;
it was quite substantial: $135.5 billion (1973 prices) in 1985, which was almost&#13;
60  percent  of  the   sector's  output  valued   at  the world   price0    It  is not&#13;
/62  This concept differs somewhat from that used by the OECD (1974)o         The ma-in&#13;
difference is that we valued energy at the opportunity cost of imported&#13;
oil - which probably overestimated the intrinsic value of coal and under-&#13;
estimated that of natural gas; whereas the OECD assumed that some forns of&#13;
energy, such as U.S. natural gas, would be underpriced as a result of price&#13;
control regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 161 -&#13;
surprising, then, that energy pricing and taxation have attracted so much&#13;
attention since the oil price increase.&#13;
Impact of Protection and Domestic Price Policies&#13;
A small part of this rent will be left to energy producers as a reward&#13;
for increasing output and to cover the extra capital costs of accelerated&#13;
development.   By far the largest part will be taxed away by governments.      A major&#13;
issue in energy policy will be whether taxes should absorb less than the full&#13;
rent, so as to make it possible to subsidize consumers by keeping prices below&#13;
the opportunity cost of imported energy; or whether, in the interest of energy&#13;
autonomy, taxes should push domestic prices above world prices of energy.         Both&#13;
tendencies can be observed today.      It is assumed in the model that they will&#13;
cancel each other after some years, but events may disprove this.&#13;
The models were therefore simulated under two alternative pricing&#13;
assumptions.    In the first, domestic energy prices were kept $1.50 per barrel&#13;
below world prices by price controls./63       In the second, the price was raised&#13;
above 'the world   price by the    same amount.     Accumulation of OPEC countries'&#13;
foreign assets was constrained to remain at the same level in all, three cases to&#13;
avoid bias of the calculation from the impact of capital imports on GNP.&#13;
The impressive result of the model was that a divergence between the&#13;
domestic and the world price of energy had a very small welfare cost but a very&#13;
large impact on oil imports.    The $1.5 "subsidy" reduced welfare by $0.7 billion,&#13;
but increased oil imports by 28 percent; whereas the equivalent "tariff" reduced&#13;
welfare by $4.2 billion and reduced imports by 27 percent./64 Domestic oil&#13;
/63 This would cost $58.5 billion, about half of the economic rent on energy&#13;
which arose as a result of the oil price increase.&#13;
/64, This represented $0.78 per barrel of imports saved and $0.95 per barrel of&#13;
additional imports.&#13;

policies have a major impact on the achievement of energy aelf-sufficiency0 This&#13;
figure has a w-ide margin of uncertainty, because of the likelihood that demand&#13;
and supply functions are less smooth than is assumed in SfMRICH, with "steps"&#13;
corresponding to the prices at which Large energy sources become economic.      The&#13;
real price impact could, therefore, be either substantially larger or subs-&#13;
tantially smaller than the figures obtained.&#13;
The Welfare Triangle Rule-of-Thumb&#13;
A commonly used shortcut in wnelfare analysis is to measure welfare gains&#13;
or losses by taking half of the product of a price difference and the cor-&#13;
responding quantity difference.   The formula is exact if the relevant demand and&#13;
supply curves are linear.&#13;
The relevant equations of SIYRICH are not linear, but it is interesting&#13;
to note that the welfare triangle approximation predicts the results of the model&#13;
quite accurately0    The 1974 response of the model implies a 3051 "flexibility&#13;
offset" and a 2.74 "import substituticn cost."   According to the welfare triangle&#13;
rule-of-thumb, these figures should be half of the import saving, i.e., 30120&#13;
Imperfect adjustment of domestic to ivorld prices in 1974 implies a welfare loss&#13;
of $730 million0    This is close to half of the product of the pzice distortion&#13;
and its impact on imports, i.e., (2033 per barrel/day x 365 days x 1069 million&#13;
barrel days)/2 = 719 million.   Dynamic simulation of the model shoows that a $150&#13;
subsidy to consumers causes a 7045 million barrel/day increase in imports, i.e.,&#13;
(lo5 x 7.45 x 0.365)/2      $2.04 billion.    The "dynamic" welfare loss is $0.7&#13;
billion0   The correspondence is less close, perhaps because of the complexity of&#13;
the dynamic adjustment process; but t-ie orders of magnitude correspond0&#13;

Impact on Growth of the Reinvested Foreign Assets of Oil-Producing&#13;
Countries&#13;
We finally turned to the bankers' gain realized on capital imports into&#13;
developed countries.     This was very difficult     to measure,  both because the&#13;
parameters which determined it were not well-known and because of conceptual&#13;
difficulties.   The bankers' gain was not the depositors' loss, and the results&#13;
presented should not be misinterpreted.    We presented two measures, which reflect&#13;
different theoretical concepts.&#13;
a.  On a cash basis, the gain may be measured as the difference between&#13;
the internal rate of return on additional capital invested in&#13;
developed countries and the rate of interest paid to the oil-&#13;
producing countries.&#13;
b.  The gain defined in (a) contributes to national income; part of it&#13;
is reinvested and thus contributes to the growth of GNP.      A second&#13;
measure of the gain is therefore obtained by comparing the levels of&#13;
national income in simulations in which oil producers either&#13;
reinvest or do not reinvest their surpluses in developed countries.&#13;

Both measures show, however, that the reinvestment of 2cczeign assets of&#13;
oil-producing countries makes a signi.fcant contTibution to the national inccme&#13;
of developed countries.   The "differerce in GNP" measures implied that, by 1985,&#13;
GNP of developed countries would be $31 billion higener if oil-producing countries&#13;
reinvested their surpluses in these countries than if they did not.      The total&#13;
impact on GNP of higher oil prices was $95 billion if there wJas no reinvestment&#13;
of surpluses, compared with $64 billion if surpluses accumulated to the extent&#13;
predicted by SIMRICHo&#13;
The figures, of course, werc the result of the assume6 wide divergence&#13;
between the return on capital (1402 percent at the high oil prfice) and the 2&#13;
percent real rate of return on foreign assets of oil producers0         The latter&#13;
figure reflects postwar experience.   As to the former, it mast be realized that&#13;
about half of the return on capital       ars tazed aw^7ay by governments in most&#13;
countries; the model rate of return tuas a "social return" which included external&#13;
economies associated with investment, such as so-called learnisng effects.     The&#13;
net rate of return to investors in equity probably did not exceed 4-5 percent, so&#13;
that it was not unbelievable that tae interest discrepancy would persist in the&#13;
future.&#13;
V0 Conclusions&#13;
The SIMRICH model was buil- to study the long-run impact of higher oil&#13;
prices on the growth of developing countries, and hence on the export markets of&#13;
developing countries0   This suggests that the SIMRICH model be used to examine&#13;
the long-run impact of higher oil prices on developed countvies.        Though the&#13;
imperfections of any such models malte it necessary to be cautious in interpreting&#13;
their results, three conclusions seem to emerge0&#13;
The conclusion which we felt was most strongly establ-shed w-fas th&amp;t the&#13;
pessimistic views sometimes presenLed about the impact of higher oil prices on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 165 -&#13;
the growth potential of developed countries were devoid of justification.       This&#13;
judgment, which seems optimistic in the light of subsequent developments, must be&#13;
qualified by the fact that the model describes only potential growth, and says&#13;
nothing about the short-run problems of income distribution struggles, demand,&#13;
price, and balance-of-payments management which result from the increase in oil&#13;
prices.   These problems can be overcome by national and international economic&#13;
cooperation which we thought would be manageable; growth could then resume at&#13;
rates very close to those which seemed possible before the increase in oil&#13;
prices.&#13;
A second conclusion was that - provided that the balance-of-payments&#13;
surpluses of oil-exporting countries were recycled without causing undue pertur-&#13;
bation - they might make a significant contribution to the growth of GNP of&#13;
developed countries, helping to offset the unfavorable impact of higher energy&#13;
prices.    The  figures  presented   in  the  paper  were,  however,  subject   to a&#13;
substantial margin of error, reflecting uncertainty about rates of return, and&#13;
about the amounts of capital which might be forthcoming, and their allocation&#13;
between developed and developing countries.&#13;
The third conclusion was that domestic price policies in developed&#13;
countries would have a large impact on their oil imports.        To the extent that&#13;
these imports influence the prices which oil exporters find feasible to impose,&#13;
these policies may therefore have a significant impact on the terms of trade of&#13;
the non-oil-exporting developing world.      Here again, it was stressed that the&#13;
results presented were no more than very broad orders of magnitude.&#13;

ALTERNATIVE POLICIES AND THE GLOBAL ANALYSIS&#13;
The model system described in the preceding chapters was used in the&#13;
first place to derive a "most likely"7 scenario of economic developments in tne&#13;
world economy.     The assumptions   behlnd  that  scenario  in some  cases implied&#13;
unchanged policies compared to the past; in others, policies "imost likely" under&#13;
the prevailing circumstances.    The selection of these policies for the base case&#13;
projections  is the first issue discussed here.       The selection of alternative&#13;
policies is then reviewed.&#13;
As has already been mentioned, the policy emphasis of the successive&#13;
annual studies gradually shifted.     T.ie first versions focused on the interna-&#13;
tional policies which could help the developing countries to adjust to the new&#13;
and more difficult    environment0    As time went by, increasing     attention was&#13;
devoted to the policies of the developing countries themselves in the adjustment&#13;
process0  Thus, over time, a more balanced approach evolved0          Tnis shift in&#13;
emphasis reflected not just the changes in tne international oituation, whIc'h&#13;
required first of all an international response, but also the iritial difficulty&#13;
in obtaining a coherent view of the actions which developing countries themselves&#13;
were undertaking0&#13;
The discussion of policy alternatives can therefore best be structured&#13;
by distinguishing international policies from national ones, and within the&#13;
latter those characteristics of the main economic regions of the world: t'ne&#13;
industrial countries which are membe'es of the OECD, the ol-exporting countries&#13;
which are members of OPEC, and the developing countries which in the main are&#13;
importers of oil0     Within the latter group a further distinction between the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 167 -&#13;
lower-income countries and middle-income countries is useful, as there are&#13;
significant differences between them in terms of alternative policies available&#13;
to them.&#13;
International Policies&#13;
The recession in the industrial countries and the sharp increase of the&#13;
oil price had immediate repercussions on the balance of payments of the oil-&#13;
importing developing countries.    There was therefore an urgent need for improved&#13;
international policies for trade and aid.     A number of developing countries had&#13;
fortunately  benefited   substantially  from high commodity prices     in 1973,  and&#13;
continued to benefit during part of 1974.      As their import levels had not yet&#13;
adjusted to the larger availability of foreign exchange, their reserves had&#13;
increased. This provided them with a cushion to withstand, at least temporarily,&#13;
the deterioration of the current accounts of their balances-of-payments.&#13;
The scope for changing trade policies is small in the short run.        The&#13;
best that can be hoped, particularly under recessionary circumstances, is that&#13;
the industrial countries would not try to protect their own balances-of-payments&#13;
by  protectionist  measures.     There  was  a  real  temptation  to  do  so as   the&#13;
industrial countries experienced a deterioration of their balances-of-payments of&#13;
an unprecedented magnitude as a consequence of the oil price increase.        It was&#13;
thus an act of considerable importance when the OECD countries issued a joint&#13;
declaration early in 1974 pledging themselves to the maintenance of free-trade&#13;
policies.&#13;
In the short run, therefore, the main emphasis of international policy&#13;
recommendations had to be in the area of capital flows.         A large part of the&#13;
policy discussion, particularly in 1974, therefore centered on ways of increasing&#13;
official flows to developing countries, and on the need to maintain or improve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -&#13;
their access to capital markets.   As a corollary, issues of creditworthiness and&#13;
of debt management became central to the discussion0      It was pointed out that&#13;
many developing countries had derived significant benefits from inflation in the&#13;
international economy, as it had reduced the burden of debt service on their&#13;
foreign exchange earnings.    It was far from easy to analyze capital flows in a&#13;
satisfactory manner, as data from a variety of scurces had to be combined into a&#13;
consistent presentation0   Around the same time, considerable changes were taking&#13;
place with respect to the sources of capital for the developing countrieso&#13;
Capital from private sources had been grow-ing in importance for some years, and a&#13;
number of developing countries found that they had access to a      rapidly grctling&#13;
international capital market0   it ijas clear that a distinction between the iowar-&#13;
income countries depending mainly on concessional capital and tne middle-inccme&#13;
countries with access to a wider variety of sources twas i1mportant for thle&#13;
analysis0   This distinction also led to a discussion on the distribution of&#13;
concessional assistance among recipient countries.    It was found that within the&#13;
total availability of concessional resources, considerable benefits could be&#13;
obtained for the lower-income countries through shifts of these flowfs betueen&#13;
destinations0&#13;
The emphasis on short-term measures to improve the balance-of-payments&#13;
situation of developing countries w«as from the beginning matched by a discussion&#13;
of the longer-term trade policies Wnich would help the developing countries to&#13;
regain a more tenable balance of payments and stable growth without excessive&#13;
dependence on external capital0   The 197T analysis contained a summary of a study&#13;
concerning the effects of trade liberalization on primary comamodities.     It also&#13;
discussed, in a general manner, ways of maintaining and improving access of the&#13;
developing countries to manufactured goods markets in industrial countries0    This&#13;
analysis was much improved in subsequent years0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -&#13;
Policy of OECD Countries&#13;
Economic developments in the industrial countries enter the model system&#13;
exogenously.  Nevertheless, considerable attention has been given over the years&#13;
to policies considered beneficial for growth and stability in the industrial&#13;
countries.  To demonstrate the importance of growth-oriented policies, all of the&#13;
global studies included alternative assumptions with respect to growth in the&#13;
industrial countries.    The models illustrated the impact of growth policies in&#13;
the OECD area in easing the adjustment of the developing countries to the new&#13;
international circumstances.&#13;
For capital flows, the main issue was the level of concessional capital&#13;
flows which could be expected to originate in the industrial countries in future&#13;
years.  The decline of the share of concessional resources in the national income&#13;
of the industrial countries had already continued for a numbers of years, and it&#13;
was clear that continuation of these trends could only aggravate the outlook for&#13;
the developing countries.    This was particularly the case for the lower-income&#13;
countries which are virtually entirely dependent on concessional capital.        As&#13;
about 40 percent of all concessional resources used to be directed to the middle-&#13;
income countries, alternative assumptions illustrating how a redistribution could&#13;
improve the prospects of the lower-income countries seemed appropriate.&#13;
The analysis of the composition of concessional assistance made it clear&#13;
that it is far from easy to increase disbursement levels in the short-run.        A&#13;
substantial part of concessional flows represents technical assistance which is&#13;
not freely available to the recipient country, and another part is linked to&#13;
projects with long gestation periods.       A shift between groups of recipient&#13;
countries, or an increase of total disbursements, can therefore only be achieved&#13;
if a large proportion of additional aid is given in the form of program&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
170 &#13;
The OECD countries were the recipients of large flows of deposits&#13;
reflecting   the  large   balance-of-payments   surpluses   of  most   oil-exporting&#13;
countries.     A  substantial   part  of  these   inflows  found  its  way   to  the&#13;
international capital market, where it could be tapped by a number of developing&#13;
countries considered creditworthy for such capital.     The issues related to these&#13;
capital flows became known as the recycling problem, and the early versions of&#13;
the Bank's global analyses devoted consideraole attention to this issue.          In&#13;
contrast to a view which was widely held, the Bank at no time considered the&#13;
problem of recycling to be insurmountable; emphasis was place6 on the need for&#13;
cooperation between the industrial countries in order to forestall undesirable&#13;
movements of capital between industrial countries for speculative purposeso      The&#13;
belief that recycling was manageable led to studying how it could be made&#13;
beneficial to the developing countries0       This became a major area of policy&#13;
concern.&#13;
The discussion of trade policies for the industrial countries emphasized&#13;
longer-run issues0    Better policies for both primary commodities and manufac-&#13;
turing goods were viewed as a key way of promoting the restoration of manageable&#13;
balance-of-payments positions of developing countries0       As was stated before,&#13;
most of that discussion was initially of a rather general nature, but developed&#13;
over time into a more penetrating analysis of tariffs and effective protection,&#13;
quantitative restrictions, and the need for adjustment assistance to sectors in&#13;
the industrial countries which would oe unable to compete with imports from the&#13;
developing countries0&#13;
Policy of OPEC Countries&#13;
For the oil-exporting countries, the primary focus was, of course, on&#13;
their oil price policies0      In each successive version of the Bank's global&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 171 -&#13;
analyses, considerable attention was given to the prospective developments of oil&#13;
supply and demand.     It was found that the oil market would probably support&#13;
maintenance of the oil price in real terms, although demand was expected to be&#13;
weak during the recession period.     Recovery in the industrial countries, would,&#13;
however, increase the demand for oil sufficiency to balance available supplies&#13;
from the oil-exporting countries, and it was therefore considered likely that in&#13;
the long-run a major decline of the oil price was unlikely. As an alternative to&#13;
a stable real price of oil, the early versions envisaged a gradual decline of the&#13;
real price, considering in particular its effects on the balance of payments of&#13;
the developing   countries.    The purpose   of that analysis was    to measure  the&#13;
implications of oil price alternatives for developing countries; there was no&#13;
suggestion that the oil market would be weak enough to create a price decrease.&#13;
The basic analysis of the world economy assumed the maintenance of the oil price&#13;
with perhaps a moderate drop of that price in real terms.&#13;
The acceptance of the oil price as given led to considerable emphasis on&#13;
the trade and aid policies of the OPEC countries.          Oil-importing developing&#13;
countries had only a very small share of about 7 percent of OPEC's total&#13;
imports.   It was expected that these imports would rise very rapidly, and SIMLINK&#13;
confirmed that developing countries would derive substantial benefit from such a&#13;
trend.    An element   in the   picture  which was   initially overlooked   was  the&#13;
substantial transfers of workers' remittances caused by substantial labor&#13;
migration from several developing countries to the oil-exporting countries.       For&#13;
some countries, the magnitude of these transfers has considerably eased balance-&#13;
of-payments problems.&#13;
Finally, capital flows from the OPEC countries to the oil-importing&#13;
developing countries were analyzed with some care.     These capital flows were not&#13;
very  well   recorded,  and  initially  the   numbers  were  only  crude  estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 172 -&#13;
Alternative policies were studied for each of the oil exporters which took into&#13;
account their balance-of-payments prospects and the distribution o:? these capital&#13;
flows over recipients.    Similarly to the OECD countries, it was found that the&#13;
OPEC countries allocated aid flows rather unevenly betwJeen recipient countries,&#13;
and a shift in the distribution to the benefit of the louer-inconne countries was&#13;
advocated0&#13;
Policy in the Oil-Importing Developing Countries&#13;
It was far from easy in the beginning to obtain a picture of the&#13;
situation and adjustment policy in the developing countries, as such information&#13;
tends to become available only with a considerable time lago         It was clear,&#13;
however, that for many countries in the absence of additional capital flowys,&#13;
imports had to be restricted.      But there were considerable differences among&#13;
countries as to the degree to which they followed this course of action0&#13;
Curtailing import demand is in many countries highly unpopular and in others even&#13;
impossible because of the essential nature of the imported goods0 It was only in&#13;
later versions of the global analyses that countries could be distinguished by&#13;
the types of policies they adopted and the effectiveness with which they adhered&#13;
to them.   The same applied to borrowing from abroad, which was managed well by&#13;
some but unwisely by others; a clear link could be established between the&#13;
quality of each country's balance-of£payments policies and the dcmestic price&#13;
policies which it adopted0    The clearest example of the latter was, of course,&#13;
provided by the degree.to which countries passed on the oil price increase to&#13;
their domestic consumers.&#13;
Each of the versions of the global analysis was addressed to a series of&#13;
long-term policy issues for the developing countries,        Here a wide range of&#13;
issues was discussed at increasing depth over the years. Initially, the emphasis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 173 -&#13;
was on energy substitution and the management of external debt; later, there was&#13;
increasing emphasis on export promotion, the efficiency of allocating investment&#13;
resources, and the crucial importance of promoting domestic agricultural and food&#13;
production.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The base case of all projections aimed at estimating prospective growth&#13;
in the developing countries. It was clear that under conditions of unchanged or&#13;
most likely policies there was little chance that the 6 percent growth target&#13;
would be achieved.    Policy alternatives were therefore tested to assess their&#13;
contribution to achievement of the original 6 percent growth target and to a&#13;
smooth adjustment of the developing countries to the new external environment.&#13;
Sensitivity&#13;
As indicated earlier, the central projection, or base case, was derived&#13;
from an aggregation of country projections, each of which embodied the basic&#13;
assumptions about growth and international trade of the industrial countries, a&#13;
set of projections of capital flows, and a derived set of commodity price&#13;
projections.   A proper analysis of alternative development scenarios would have&#13;
therefore gone back to the individual country models to derive new projections&#13;
from each of those which subsequently would have had to be aggregated again.    The&#13;
alternative projections which were presented in the World Bank's analyses were&#13;
instead based on the SIMLINK model of trade and growth.      This generated a base&#13;
case   forecast  which  was   roughly  consistent   with  the   aggregated  country&#13;
projections; any simulations outside that range would have resulted in doubtful&#13;
estimates  and  projections.     The  actual  use  of  the  SIMLINK  framework  for&#13;
alternative scenarios probably went to the extremes of its capability, as very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
174 -&#13;
large variations of some of the basic assumptions were incorporated in the&#13;
projections.&#13;
The  sensitivity   test  centered   on  four  major  areas.     Alternative&#13;
assumptions were introduced for:&#13;
a. the growth rate of GNP in the industrial countries;&#13;
bo the future movements of the oi'l price;&#13;
c. alternative trade policies of the industrial countries; and&#13;
do  alternative levels of capital flows0&#13;
The first three assumptions all related to exogenous inputs into Zhe&#13;
model framework, which generated projections of the developing countries subject&#13;
to assumptions on capital flows.     The Last one therefore constztu:ed a reversed&#13;
test in which capital flows were the closi-ng element to gene.-ate a particular&#13;
target rate of growth in the developing countries0        Each of the alternatives&#13;
tested the impact of alternative assumptions on thze rate of growth of GNP of the&#13;
developing countries, and on the development cf their balancesof-payments.         A&#13;
particular characteristic of the capital fiot-w3 projections needs to be stressed&#13;
here.   As concessional flows were given from the supply side and creditworthy&#13;
countries were assumed to borrow additional capital to the -xtent their debt&#13;
position permitted, any additional flows beyond those specified in the base case&#13;
needed therefore to be entirely on concessio.al terms.         Any other assumption&#13;
would have generated levels of debt and debt service iLn excess of amounts&#13;
dictated by prudent management.&#13;
The projections   of growth a-n6 the balance of payments of developing&#13;
countries were made by regions and -,ncome classes0       As wiEl be seen in what&#13;
follows, the economic    structure  of the country groupings and      the  impact of&#13;
alternative  assumptions  differed widely0      Part  of this  rs'Clected  levels  of&#13;
development and to some extent the degree to which countries were integrated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 175 -&#13;
through  international   trade  and  payments.     The  discussion   which  follows&#13;
distinguishes such country groups to a lesser extent than was the case in most of&#13;
the successive versions of the World Bank's global projections.       Of the three&#13;
country groups discussed, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa both belong to the&#13;
lower-income country category, and a third category, the middle-income countries,&#13;
was not further specified as there were no great differences between the impact&#13;
of alternative assumptions on the development of the regional subgroups.&#13;
OECD Growth&#13;
In the version of the global analysis issued in the middle of 1976, the&#13;
base case assumption of growth in the industrial countries was put at 5 percent&#13;
per year for the period 1978-85.     This growth rate was assumed to follow from&#13;
somewhat higher growth rates in the years 1975-78, reflecting the recovery from&#13;
the depression after 1973.      Alternative assumptions were made for both sub-&#13;
periods, but in the discussion of alternative projections only the 1978-85 period&#13;
is discusssed   as  they  lend  themselves  better to a discussion of long-term&#13;
interrelations between groups of countries.      The alternatives for OECD growth&#13;
were put at 0.3 percent above and below the base case assumption; the high&#13;
alternative assumptions affected the growth of the developing countries, and&#13;
there  were   marked  differences   between   the  lower-  and   the  middle-income&#13;
countries.   For South Asia, the model projected almost the same changes of GDP&#13;
growth rates as were assumed for the OECD group. In other words, over the range&#13;
of  these  sensitivity  tests,   the  elasticity  of growth   in  the  lower-income&#13;
countries to growth in the industrial countries appeared to be equal to 1.0.     By&#13;
contrast, the middle-income countries appeared to be much more sensitive to what&#13;
happened in the industrial countries; the changes in their growth rates were&#13;
about twice as large over the relevant range as those assumed at the beginning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 176 -&#13;
for the OECD countries. The reason for this difference was clearly the fact that&#13;
the lower-income countries had much weaker ties, both in termis of trade and&#13;
capital inflows, with the industrial countries. The middle-income countries' de-&#13;
pendence on trade made them more sensitive to growth in the industrial countries.&#13;
The causation of those differences was seen more clearly when trade&#13;
developments  were  brought   into  the  picture.    It  was  then  found  that  the&#13;
sensitivity of the lower-income countrles' exports to growth in the OECD area was&#13;
expressed by an elasticity somewhere between 200 and 3.0.     For the middle-income&#13;
countries, this elasticity was about 7°O, more than twice as high as applied to&#13;
the lower-income countries. In other words, the swings which could take place in&#13;
export growth under the assumption of alternative rates of development in&#13;
industrial countries were considerably larger in the middle-income countries than&#13;
in the lower-income countries.&#13;
The effect on imports was even more marked than on exports, because&#13;
export earnings had to finance factor costs and debt service charges wjhich&#13;
changed very little over the range of the basic assumptions.          The growth of&#13;
imports was always at a lower rate than for exports over the projection period,&#13;
as a result of the heavy borrowing after 1973 and the increase Ln debt service.&#13;
As projected import growth rates varied about as much as export growth rates, but&#13;
around a lower average, the elasticity of imports to OECD growth exceeded tne&#13;
elasticity of exports0 The large difference between the lower- and middle--ncome&#13;
countries in terms of the sensitivities of international trade 'o growth in the&#13;
industrial countries explained a significant part of the differences in the&#13;
sensitivity of their GNP growth0    The fact that international trade constituted a&#13;
much larger share of the GDP of the middle-income than the lower income countries&#13;
increased the impact of the alternative assumptions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 177 -&#13;
The character of the model used for the projections did not permit the&#13;
testing of large divergences from the base path and therefore could not be a&#13;
guide  for   the  analyses  of   developing  countries'   prospects  under  extreme&#13;
conditions.    It  would  be  inappropriate,  for  example,  to suggest   that the&#13;
proportionality of growth between the lower-income countries and the industrial&#13;
countries would have applied over a broader range of alternatives.      In fact, it&#13;
may well be that higher growth rates in the industrial countries would not result&#13;
in higher growth in the lower-income countries given the latter's limited ability&#13;
to absorb investment resources.    Similarly, further reductions of growth in the&#13;
industrial countries may have less impact on the lower-income countries, because&#13;
large segments of the economy are almost entirely segregated from international&#13;
influences.   It was thought, however, that this reasoning might not apply to the&#13;
middle-income countries which were more closely integrated with international&#13;
trade and payments, could absorb larger investment resources, and could generate&#13;
considerably higher growth rates if the necessary resources could somehow be made&#13;
available.   Intuitively, it seemed, therefore, that the high degree of sensi-&#13;
tivity of these countries to growth in the industrial countries could very well&#13;
extend over a fairly broad range of alternative assumptions.&#13;
Export Growth&#13;
The base case assumptions assumed no significant changes in interna-&#13;
tional trade policies.   Under that condition, exports of the developing countries&#13;
were projected to grow at about 7 percent per year through 1985. As an alterna-&#13;
tive  assumption,   the  analysis   of  international   trade   policies  suggested&#13;
considerable scope for a more rapid growth of exports in volume terms by about 1&#13;
percent per year.   The effect of these higher exports wer-e distributed unequally&#13;
over groups   of  developing  countries.    As Sub-Saharan Africa hardly exports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 &#13;
manufactured goods, improved trade policies with respect to imports of&#13;
manufactures would not have benefited these countries over the course of the&#13;
projection period, through 19850      For South Asia, the situation was somewhat&#13;
better, as the lower-income countries in that region have traditionally exported&#13;
manufactured goods and could therefore have benefited from improved trade&#13;
policies toward such goods.    The main beneficiaries of such policies would have&#13;
been the middle-income countries which have expanded their manufactured goods&#13;
exports in the past at a very rapid rate and would be able to make use of&#13;
additional opportunities quite quickly.      The effect on the GDP of the latter&#13;
group of countries was as large as that of faster OECD growth.&#13;
Supply conditions were also of importance. To make use of better export&#13;
opportunities, the South Asian countries had to focus more strongly on the&#13;
international market, and on the export of those goods and services for which&#13;
they have a competitive advantage0     Such policies were lacking in the past, at&#13;
least sufficiently continuously to make use of the export possibilities which&#13;
were being grasped by other developing countries0       Such a change of policy in&#13;
South Asian countries would have led them to pay more attention to the efficient&#13;
use of resources, and this would in itself have stimulated even further their&#13;
economic growth. A significant change in policies had to be assamed to permit&#13;
higher export growth rates in those countries0     The higher GDP growth rate which&#13;
was assumed to result would not have resulted entirely from the growth of&#13;
exports, but rather related to a complex set of policy alternatives implemented&#13;
in those countries0&#13;
Aid Flows&#13;
With the base case assumption of 5 percent OECD growth, 7 percent export&#13;
growth, and concessional aid flows at a virtually constant percentage of the GNP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -&#13;
of the richer countries, the developing countries grew at about 5.2 percent per&#13;
annum over the decade of the 1970s.      This was clearly well below the target of&#13;
the  second  development   decade.    A higher   rate  of growth   in the   industrial&#13;
countries and liberalization of trade to promote exports from the developing&#13;
countries could raise this growth rate, but it seemed unlikely that the target of&#13;
6 percent for the decade could be achieved even under the best of circums-&#13;
tances.    It was thought that in the years after 1980 this target rate could&#13;
probably be achieved under optimistic assumptions.         But  the average for all&#13;
developing countries hid the fact that the lower-income countries were much below&#13;
the  ta'rget  rate,  although   the  middle-income   countries  achieved   it.    This&#13;
reflected to some extent the limited participation of the first group in trade,&#13;
but even more the very, difficult development problems which they faced.           The&#13;
alternative of increasing the flows of concessional assistance above the levels&#13;
assumed in the base case was therefore considered.      For many of the lower-income&#13;
countries, it would have been unrealistic to assume that a target growth rate of&#13;
6 percent per annum could be achieved even under the best circumstances of&#13;
international trade and the availability of capital.      As already indicated, some&#13;
of these countries needed to make major adjustments in their domestic policies to&#13;
improve   the   efficiency   of   resource   use   before   growth   rates  could   be&#13;
accelerated.   Such changes take time and the best assumption that could be made&#13;
here is that policy changes introduced in the next few years could gradually&#13;
accelerate their rate of growth over the early 1980s, reaching 6 percent per year&#13;
around 1985.    The average for the years between now and 1985 would, of course,&#13;
remain below 6 percent, probably somewhere around 5 percent per year.&#13;
The additional aid requirements for a growth rate performance of this&#13;
kind did not seem to be excessive.       By 1985, net disbursements of concessional&#13;
assistance to the lower-income countries would have needed to be $3.5 billion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* 180&#13;
higher than in the base case, that is, about 10-20 percent higher than the levels&#13;
projected for that year.   In terms of the share of concessional assistance in the&#13;
donor countries' GNP, an increase froLu the base case projection of 0.35 percent&#13;
of 0.40 percent of GNP wias implied. This xwas still barely half the target level&#13;
incorporated in the strategy for the second development decade.&#13;
About two-thirds of this disbursement would have needed to be allocated&#13;
to South Asia and the other one-third to the lower-income countries in Africa&#13;
south of Sahara.   In earlier versions of the Bank's global analysis, attention&#13;
was also given to the possibility of shifting concessional resources betuzen&#13;
groups of recipient countries.   In the early 1970s, about 10 percent of official&#13;
capital transfers went to the oil-exporting countries and about half of the&#13;
remainder went to the middle-income countries.      Then account was taken of the&#13;
level of per capita income in many of the middle-income recipient countries, and&#13;
also the high per capita aid receipts in some of these countries, it appeared&#13;
that  considerable  shifts  in the allocation    of concessional  assistance v--re&#13;
feasible.   Under these circumstances, it was clearly possible to find the $3.5&#13;
billion needed for the lower-income countries in 1985 through shifts in&#13;
allocations.   This would not necessarily have resulted in significantly lc.-er&#13;
growth of the middle-income countries, for they would be able to adjust to&#13;
smaller flows of concessional capital0    Many of these countries which benefited&#13;
from concessional   flows  would also borrow in capital mariets on commercial&#13;
terms0  A shift of concessional resources at the expense of some other middle-&#13;
income countries, however, may have retarded their rates of growtho       However,&#13;
this  analysis  was  not   carried  beyond  simple  estimates  of  the  additional&#13;
requirements of the lower-income countries for more rapid growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 181 -&#13;
Reliability&#13;
The limitations of the analysis should not, of course, be ignored.     The&#13;
dominance of the ability to import as a determinant of growth was a weakness of&#13;
the system.   Clearly, this is a gross oversimplification which for many country&#13;
groups cannot withstand the test of historical analysis.      Particularly for the&#13;
lower-income countries, the link between imports and growth is weak or even&#13;
nonexistent.  This emphasis also tended to detract from more detailed analysis of&#13;
the impact of domestic policies on growth.       The formulation of the models in&#13;
terms of a straight linkage between imports and growth made it rather difficult&#13;
to introduce the domestic policies of the developing countries other than in a&#13;
verbal sense, as they were not a part of the quantitative framework itself.&#13;
A second problem was the lack of integration between developments in the&#13;
real sphere and the behavior of prices.      The entire system contained only one&#13;
exogenous determined projection of inflation which was not affected by the&#13;
alternative assumptions concerning growth and trade in the world economy.     Here,&#13;
of course, it can be claimed that the discussion on the causes and sources of&#13;
inflation has not yet advanced to the point where a clear theory lends itself to&#13;
application   in  a  quantitative  setting.     Still,  the  absence  of  inflation&#13;
alternatives and a full specification of the relation between inflation in the&#13;
industrial countries and the prices which developing countries have to face&#13;
externally remained a weakness of the analytical system.&#13;
Another important omission related to the recursiveness of the modeling&#13;
system which started from assumptions about the industrial countries and oil&#13;
price policies by OPEC and ended with projections for the developing countries.&#13;
The latter did not have an impact in the reverse direction, so that OECD growth&#13;
was seen as entirely independent of the development and policies in the&#13;
developing  countries.    In   earlier  years,  this  assumption  could  have  been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 182 -&#13;
defended, as the impact of developing countries on the w-orld economy eras indeed&#13;
very small.    In more recent years, this assumpton has proven to be no longez&#13;
tenable, as the size of the trade, particularly of the middle-income countrlec9&#13;
has grown significantly and as their access to capital market:s allowed them&#13;
considerable   flexibility   in  balance-of-payments   policies.     Thus,   in  an&#13;
independent exercise which used the NUTILINK system, Holsen and -^iaelbroeck have&#13;
demonstrated that in 1974 and 1975 the export and borrowing policies of the&#13;
middle-income developing countries mairtained their imports Et considerably&#13;
higher  levels  than otherwise would have been the case.         As  these  imports&#13;
originated to a large extent in the industrial countries, the latter experienced&#13;
somewhat more favorable export grouth than would otherwise have been the case.&#13;
Holsen and Waelbroeck estimated that, £s a consequence, tne GNP of the industzial&#13;
countries increased by 03 percent more (or decreased by OD3 percent less) than&#13;
would have been the case if developing countries had not pursued these policies.&#13;

THE MULTILINK SYSTEM OF DYMAMIC MULTIPLIERS&#13;
The MULTILINK system of dynanic multipliers was derived frem the Link&#13;
model of the world economy, and the Desmos model of the EEC countries0         'fhe&#13;
multipliers  described the impact of GNP of exogenous changes        in income and&#13;
expenditures, which are interpreted as tax and spending multiplfers.        Because&#13;
they  were  based   on  linked  models,  they   took  into  acccunt cross   impacts&#13;
transmitted between countries via international trade and international price&#13;
linkages.&#13;
The system combined information derived from simulations of the Link and&#13;
Desmos models.    Each of these sources provides only a part of the desired&#13;
information.    Simulations of the Link system    provided data on the impact of&#13;
autonomous expenditure changes, not on the impact of income changes; these&#13;
simulations covered a period of three years only. The Desmos multipliers covered&#13;
a five-year period, but they were availabe only for the first, third, and fifth&#13;
years0  The Desmos model treats the rest of the world as exogenous, and therefore&#13;
neglected feedback originating from relations between the EEC ccuntries and the&#13;
rest of the world.   It was thus necessary to combine the txwo types of information&#13;
by making a number of adjustments:&#13;
a0 Desmos multipliers were interpolated for the second and fourth years;&#13;
b.  For the EC countries, the Desmos multipliers were used '-n preference to&#13;
the Link multipliers for those countries;&#13;
co  For  other  countries,  the L'ik multipliers    were used0     These were&#13;
extrapolated for the fourth and fifth years on the basis of Desmos&#13;
results;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 185 -&#13;
d.  Income multipliers were not available for non-EEC countries.      For those&#13;
countries, income multipliers were calculated by reducing expenditure&#13;
multipliers proportionally to the ratio between the Desmos expenditure&#13;
and income multipliers.&#13;
The multipliers presented a simplified picture of the properties of the&#13;
models.   The "expenditure" multipliers were used to represent the impact of any&#13;
type of autonomous change of expenditures, although in practice the structure of&#13;
Link and Desmos was such that the impact of, say, an autonomous consumption&#13;
change  would   be  different  from  that   of  an  autonomous  change  of  exports.&#13;
Likewise, the "income multipliers" were used to represent the impact of any&#13;
autonomous change affecting the incomes of consumers.       Yet the impact of, for&#13;
example, changes in direct taxes would differ from that of a change in indirect&#13;
taxes.  The MULTILINK system was thus a rough and ready tool of analysis, and was&#13;
useful mainly to provide quick estimates of the impact of major unexpected events&#13;
affecting the world economy.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This paper reviews the first stage of
            global modeling in the World Bank. It summarizes the models
            and analytical methods which were developed for that purpose
            between 1973 and 1976. These were in turn based on a large
            body of research and modeling which had taken place before
            1973, and the work has progressed since. However, the first
            phase of development remains fairly distinct, and is of
            interest in relation to the impact of the sharp rise in
            petroleum prices on global economic trends in the mid-1970s.
            The system was used to generate projections for the world
            economy to compare alternative policies, mainly in
            international trade and capital flows. The policy
            conclusions were discussed within the Bank and with other
            international agencies, and it is worth looking back to
            evaluate both the analysis and the conclusions which
            followed. This evaluation is of particular interest because
            of the large disturbances which occurred in the world
            economy during these years and because of the wide
            differences which existed with regard to the international
            policies that ought to have been pursued.
