&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]1&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Yeah, that's right. Well, then, that was our views on that. Actually, if I could&#13;
give you another lecture that I gave recently, this would really give you a current&#13;
perspective on my thoughts.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what we need, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Well, this, of course, is the one where John Holsen and Vinod Thomas were&#13;
involved in this. So that's very interesting seminar because we had a broad group of&#13;
people. Now, as you can see, my . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Was this in Bangladesh?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was it the BIDS [Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies] study?&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Yes, the BIDS study, but we did this in collaboration with WIDA [phonetic]&#13;
and . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. Iâ&#128;&#153;d like get a hold of a copy of that.&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Yes, and you know, you had Lance Taylor, Steve [Stephen A.] Marglin and&#13;
others coming in on this, so it was quite an interesting thing. We had Mohsin Khan from&#13;
the [International Monetary] Fund, and Vinod and Holsen, and Jean Baneth came in&#13;
from Geneva.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You don't find your . . .&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Well, I'm--at the moment I'm somehow not finding this. It would be just&#13;
right because it was a lecture on the whole issue of aid and sovereignty.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That would be great.&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: It related to something that had really been bothering me a lot of what I saw&#13;
of the government when I went back there. [pause to search for copy] Things have been&#13;
somewhat chaotic in the last few days because we were really preparing ourselves for the&#13;
presentations yesterday.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You could send it to us.&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Okay. Well, I may try and get this thing to the Bank. I can send it to Chris&#13;
[Christopher R. Willoughby] .&#13;

                                 November 21, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Send it to him. This is my Brookings address, although I am in Princeton much&#13;
of the time.&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Yeah, but you are spending quite a bit of time at Brookings. I see.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. They put me out to pasture in June at Princeton.&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: I see. That's rather difficult to imagine, that you would not be haunting the&#13;
place--you know, out to pasture.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I still have an office there, and [inaudible] students.&#13;
&#13;
Tell us about this great study. I mean, what were sort of the parameters of it that youâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
just delivered.&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: This is basically what the volumes look like. You may want to have a look at&#13;
this.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's a very . . .&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Yeah. You see, the premise of the whole exercise was that political parties&#13;
come into office, you know, with baggage of rhetoric but with very little appreciation of&#13;
the sort of problems which are on offer before them and some of the ways they may&#13;
really get to do something about it. And so since I was in the interim government with no&#13;
other mandate but to hold a free election, I thought I would really get a whole group of&#13;
people to work who were willing to come and volunteer their services.&#13;
&#13;
INTERRUPTION [Recording was stopped off for telephone call and apparently never&#13;
turned back on, although tape continued to run to the end of Side A. Interview continues&#13;
on Side B.]&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: . . at such and such time and permitted to go to the toilet three times a day.&#13;
And these degrees of detail which now sort of go into these aid agreements are sort of&#13;
mind-boggling.&#13;
&#13;
And these guys have come and signed all these things. You know, â&#128;&#156;You've come with&#13;
this agreement, and you have been proficient in negotiating, and you fellows are going to&#13;
implement all these conditions?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Said, â&#128;&#156;Oh, yes, sir. We certainly are going to do it. Promise youâ&#128;&#157; and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
And then they go off to Washington and they sign it, and it will come out in the World&#13;
Bank newsletter: â&#128;&#156;Agreement for 250 million dollarsâ&#128;&#157; and there will be this 20 million&#13;
next year. And you go back to this damned thing five years down the road, and what do&#13;
you have? You know, about 5 percent of the conditions have been put into effect. Where&#13;
they have been put into effect, they have been sort of distorted in their implementation.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Rehman Sobhan&#13;
                             November 21, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So if the donors actually think that they can run the government of Bangladesh, itâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
very serious mistake. And you're coming to the point where the distrust of the&#13;
government is so great amongst the donors that they think they can take over the&#13;
government, and they can take it over on paper. I mean, it isn't that you're really sending&#13;
your proconsuls to come and run our projects. The projects ought to be run by us, but the&#13;
agreements are all being carried out on paper.&#13;
&#13;
And my view is that, you know, government has to motivate itself. It has to have the felt&#13;
need for improving the performance of the economy, for taking charge of its own affairs,&#13;
for setting its own agenda. I mean, no policy papers come out of the government of&#13;
Bangladesh in 15 years. And that was the first time--we wanted to show that, my God,&#13;
you have these guys over here who have damned good ideas about what you should&#13;
really be doing with the running of this economy. I mean, you get all these guys coming&#13;
in from here and there and writing these reports--we've got 1,000 reports scattered over&#13;
the ministries. No one has read the damned things because the report has become an&#13;
exercise in itself. There will be a consultancy report written; it will [inaudible] There&#13;
will be a function at which the report is presented. People will have a sort of big tea or a&#13;
dinner, and that is the end of it because the machinery is just not geared to that. And it&#13;
has its own rhythm, its own compulsion, and until they are motivated to really do&#13;
something about this, we can't live with this nonsense, you know, that you have a zero&#13;
savings rate and this pathetically performing economy, and that all these sort of resources&#13;
are sort of congealing into nothing. Unless you do something about this, you're not going&#13;
to get anywhere. No donor is really going to make you do that because you will&#13;
assimilate what they do and really go on doing your own business in whatever way you&#13;
want.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Youâ&#128;&#153;ve just answered my second question, which was to ask you if you've ever&#13;
done a counterfactual exercise on whether, if starting in 1972, there never had been such&#13;
a thing as foreign aid in Bangladesh, you'd be better off.&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Well, you know, I think it's a counterfactual thing. I would think probably&#13;
you would have been better off, but that has in any case never been on the cards because&#13;
really what you are wanting to say is that you really have gotten to a point now where&#13;
you're way out of line with your whole region. You're running a development budget at&#13;
100 percent aid financing, which is nonsense. And the whole system has now become&#13;
counterproductive. Now you want to get down to a situation--I mean the criteria I would&#13;
push is that you want to get to a point where you can frame a development budget&#13;
without going to Paris and seeing what the consortium is going to commit to you. The&#13;
day you can do that, you will have reached my threshold point.&#13;
&#13;
Second, I would like to say is that you must be able to tell a donor that, â&#128;&#156;Look, this type&#13;
of project conditionality is not on. I don't accept this. I have my own views about how I&#13;
want to handle this.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Rehman Sobhan&#13;
                            November 21, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And if the donor says, â&#128;&#156;Okay, then we are going to suspend these disbursementsâ&#128;&#157; or&#13;
â&#128;&#156;We're going to cut off these credits,â&#128;&#157; you say, â&#128;&#156;Okay, thanks a lot. I mean, we&#13;
appreciate what you've done, but we'll do without.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
And at the end of the day you'll have to get your own act together in order to do all this.&#13;
You have to raise savings. You have to get people to pay their taxes. You have to get&#13;
people to repay their loans. And, most important, you have to reverse this time allocation:&#13;
30 percent for aid negotiations, 70 percent for post-project implementation where all the&#13;
best and the brightest who spend their time shuttling between Dhaka and Washington&#13;
negotiating aid. Will you get out into that damned irrigation area, and you raise the&#13;
command area from 30 percent to 90 percent. You go out and see that this particular&#13;
project is really training people to deliver what they were supposed to. And you have an&#13;
industry, see that it's operating at 90 percent capacity. Let's deploy our skills in that way.&#13;
I mean, if you can get that turned around, you'll have a realistic relationship with the&#13;
donors, and you will be in charge of your own agenda, and I think probably donors would&#13;
be much happier in dealing with you.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think so. You make quite a lot of sense this morning. I think we'd probably&#13;
better run along. Itâ&#128;&#153;s--unless, Richard, you want to . . .&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Yeah, well.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Itâ&#128;&#153;s a shame, really. There are so many things that I'd like toâ&#128;&#148;thereâ&#128;&#153;s just one&#13;
aspect, that maybe later on in another visit or correspondence or maybe you've written on&#13;
the subject: there's a kind of global disincentive, from all you say, and maybe you could&#13;
handle it or find ways to handle it by giving a fixed amount of aid, allowing the&#13;
government to hire the consultants that they want and so on and so on. But another aspect&#13;
to all of this is the Dutch disease aspect. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether you've thought about that&#13;
or written about it.&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Well, I have, yes. Well, I see the Dutch disease actually working in two&#13;
ways. One is simply the involution aspect to what is really done as a disincentive, but in&#13;
the narrower sense actually of, you know, exchange rates. You know, you have a very&#13;
ridiculous situation here. Two of the macroeconomic instruments for how well you're&#13;
doing are the budget balance and the foreign exchange balance of payments--and, of&#13;
course, exchange rates, third.&#13;
&#13;
Now, you can never have a realistic exchange rate in Bangladesh because 50 percent of&#13;
your external resource gap is always externally financed. So we play these silly games&#13;
with the IMF [International Monetary Fund] , who come in and have this formula of&#13;
theirs about, you know, what should be in--they say that, â&#128;&#156;Okay, it's 35 takas to the&#13;
dollar. It should really be 25.8 taka,â&#128;&#157; and so on. Now, what the hell is this supposed to&#13;
mean? I don't know. If you are an externally resource-constrained economy, the external&#13;
balance is a function of aid disbursement. It's not really a function of some equilibrating&#13;
relationship between the demand and supply of foreign currency in your country. So what&#13;
happens now? When does your external balance go out of joint? When you have efficient&#13;
&#13;
                                 Rehman Sobhan&#13;
                            November 21, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
aid disbursement and when aid is flowing, then the gap increases, and this then becomes&#13;
the measure of your inefficient management, of your imbalance of payments.&#13;
&#13;
So the moment this damned gap comes up, which happens--and why it has happened is&#13;
that there is a decline in aid disbursements for two reasons: one, inefficient public sector&#13;
project implementation; two, business recession which has been almost endemic over the&#13;
course of the last decade. But now you don't import. Today no one is opening any letters&#13;
of credit even though our secondary exchange market, which is now fed from the&#13;
currency from the RTAs [regional trade agreements] as well as from our program loans,&#13;
not to mention our wage-earners, no one is opening any letters of credit. So now&#13;
Bangladesh is going to have a marvelously healthy balance of payments. Everyone will&#13;
be patting us on the back, saying, â&#128;&#156;Ah, well, look at these guys. They've really got&#13;
efficient management of their payments crisis.â&#128;&#157; But just the reverse! It's the sign of a&#13;
depression in your economy.&#13;
&#13;
Similarly with your budget balance. Everyone gets very excited if your revenue budget is&#13;
in balance, but you're running this huge aggregate public expenditure deficit because the&#13;
whole thing is balanced, is financed by aid.&#13;
&#13;
And here again the measure of what you are doing is a measure of efficiency of aid&#13;
disbursement because the critical variable of the size of the deficit is how much money&#13;
you are spending. If you spend less money, your aggregate balance naturally declines. If&#13;
you are spending it all, then suddenly the balance goes up. So the World Bank was&#13;
telling us, â&#128;&#156;Well, in the early â&#128;&#152;80s, your balances had got out of joint, so in the late â&#128;&#152;80s&#13;
because of structural adjustment lending you have now got your balances right.â&#128;&#157; All that&#13;
had happened was that the economy had been going no place at all, and you are drawing&#13;
entirely the wrong message about exchange rate stability and its sort of approximation to&#13;
equilibrium about the correct assessment of your external balance and the correct&#13;
macroeconomic assessment of your domestic balance. And these became the big issues of&#13;
public debate. And we ended up by thinking we were doing well when we were doing&#13;
badly.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: One more little question. In English, the word â&#128;&#156;self-relianceâ&#128;&#157; is very clear and&#13;
powerful. Is there an equivalent in Bengali?&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Yes. It's called â&#128;&#156;shonivor.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: â&#128;&#156;Shonivor.â&#128;&#157; It has the same sharp meaning?&#13;
&#13;
SOBHAN: Well, it's a more--it has certain cultural connotations as well, but it has got&#13;
into the public idiom from the early '70s where then actually there was strong school of&#13;
thought which said, â&#128;&#156;No aid in this area. We will do it ourselves.â&#128;&#157; Areas exposed to&#13;
famine and flood erosion took decisions at that time that, â&#128;&#156;No money will enter into this&#13;
area from outside. We will solve our own problems through our own resource&#13;
mobilization and our own effort.â&#128;&#157; This became a political matter of political principle at&#13;
various--and this acquired, I suppose, the connotation â&#128;&#156;shonivor.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
                                 Rehman Sobhan&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, you have an advantage over my country. I come from Peru, and I am&#13;
always harping on the theme of self-reliance, but we don't have a word in Spanish for&#13;
self-reliance! [Laughter]&#13;
