            Educating for health : using
            incentive-based salaries to teach oral rehydration therapy
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In Bangladesh an education program aimed
            at teaching mothers how to prepare and use oral rehydration
            solution to treat diarrhea relied on output-based incentives
            to ensure that the teaching was effective. The program tied
            field workers' pay to fast-cycle feedback on
            performance against output indicators. Monitoring results
            show that the approach worked: the mothers learned
            effectively. Over 10 years the program reached 12 million households.
