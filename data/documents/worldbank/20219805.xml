ï»¿ANNEX I OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
Program description&#13;
EC- World Bank Partnership Program for Europe and Central Asia&#13;
I.     Rationale and Scope of the Programmatic Trust Fund&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The European Commission and the World Bank Group share a common vision of building&#13;
competitive and sustainable economies and in reducing poverty and social exclusion. These goals are&#13;
outlined in the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) (2014-2020) - "The EU as a global&#13;
player". It is designed to allow the Union to fulfill its responsibility both at global level and in its&#13;
immediate neighborhood, and to help safeguard global public goods, i.e., fighting poverty and&#13;
promoting democracy, peace, stability, and prosperity. The MFF also supports the Commission's new&#13;
approach, the "Agenda for Change", to focus EU aid in fewer sectors supporting, inter alia, good&#13;
governance and creating inclusive and sustainable growth. In this context, a continued constrained&#13;
growth and a tight fiscal environment in the Neighborhood, Western Balkans, Turkey, and Central&#13;
Asia make it important for the European Commission and the World Bank Group to coordinate policy&#13;
advice, where appropriate, and to allocate their resources in the region in the most strategic and&#13;
effective way possible. As a result, the European Commission and the World Bank have begun to&#13;
interact more directly by means of a programmatic trust fund (established in 2011) to support the&#13;
Europe 2020 Agenda, as well as indirectly with the World Bank engaging directly with individual&#13;
European countries on projects that are financed by the governments entirely or in part by EU External&#13;
Action Instruments and other EU resources, such as the Structural Funds, the Rural Development Fund&#13;
or the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). These experiences continue to deepen the&#13;
mutual appreciation for the complementary competencies of each institution.&#13;
Areas of joint cooperation and the World Bank advisory activities envisioned under the Program&#13;
2.     The Commission and the World Bank Group agree that more direct interaction would be&#13;
beneficial to both institutions and through them to the countries. This applies particularly to the&#13;
provision of analytical, advisory and knowledge services, capacity and institution building, and&#13;
technical assistance, but also to projects executed by respective governments. The Commission has&#13;
already demonstrated its interest in specific analytical projects to be carried out by the World Bank,&#13;
which provide guidance for investments in the long-term prosperity and stability of the EU's&#13;
neighborhood and support the reform process in those countries preparing for EU membership. Areas&#13;
of common interest are regularly discussed and refined at sub-regional country day meetings between&#13;
the services of the European Commission and the World Bank Group that are held on an annual basis.&#13;
These meetings have focused on the Eastern Neighborhood, Central Asia and Pre-Accession countries,&#13;
and therefore cover many EU external action instruments, including: the Instrument for Pre-Accession&#13;
Assistance (IPA), the European Neighborhood Instrument (ENI), the Development Cooperation&#13;
Instrument (DCI), the Partnership Instrument (PI), and Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA).&#13;
3.    In the Western Balkans, the EC has expressed interest in the World Bank providing analytical&#13;
and technical support both at regional and national level to: (i) improve the regulatory framework for&#13;
innovative and high-potential enterprises, (ii) help improve public financial management and public&#13;
administration reform, (iii) provide support to the private sector, (iv) improve competitiveness and the&#13;
investment climate, (v) strengthen policies and institutions governing employment and social&#13;
inclusion, (vi) tackle environmental issues and the impact of climate change, (vii) investigate energy&#13;
efficiency and security of supply, and (viii) to provide technical assistance on Roma issues.&#13;
The type of activities which will be carried out under this Programmatic Trust Fund will include Bank&#13;
executed analytical services and technical assistance, as well as recipient executed technical assistance&#13;
and capacity building activities.&#13;

investment climate, venture capital, licensing, public finance management, sector approach and social&#13;
inclusion.&#13;
II.   Development Objective&#13;
6.    The objectives of the Programmatic Trust Fund are to assist the beneficiary countries in: (i)&#13;
developing policies/strategies and institutional capacity to adopt and implement the acquis&#13;
communautaire in policy areas where the World Bank Group's expertise is particularly relevant; (ii)&#13;
informing strategies, policies and financing; and (iii) to enhancing the economic development of&#13;
beneficiary countries to help the further convergence of incomes with EU member states. Depending&#13;
on the beneficiary country or countries and the type of activity to be supported, one, two or all of the&#13;
objectives will apply.&#13;
III.   Geographic scope&#13;
7.    The Programmatic Trust Fund covers all countries in Europe and Central Asia, except EU&#13;
member states, complying with the eligibility criteria of the respective EC instrument financing the&#13;
activity.&#13;
IV.    Governance&#13;
8.    The World Bank shall prepare and approve annual work plans and budgets for both the&#13;
Program and the individual activities and discuss them with the EC. It will also discuss the thematic&#13;
and geographic focus of the Program as well as the progress on activities undertaken. During these&#13;
discussions, the Bank will update the EC on the implementation progress and provide the EC with a&#13;
proposed list of activities for financing under the Program.&#13;

the region.&#13;
Specifically, the objectives are:&#13;
(a)    To assist each participating country to develop a more effective framework for corporate&#13;
financial reporting which is aligned with the acquis, contributes towards an improved&#13;
regulatory framework for business entities and helps build up a supportive ecosystem for&#13;
financing including venture capital investment;&#13;
(b)    To improve the quality of the accounting profession in each participating country to provide&#13;
effective business support services required by enterprises to improve access to finance,&#13;
improve business planning and management and comply with regulatory requirements;&#13;
(c)    To assist with experience sharing between stakeholders of the relation between improved&#13;
financial reporting and better access to finance; the lessons from this activity have been&#13;
disseminated throughout the region;&#13;
(d)    To assist the participating countries to harmonize the corporate financial reporting&#13;
frameworks, and increased awareness of the benefits and successful approaches to corporate&#13;
financial reporting reform in participating countries.&#13;
Beneficiary countries include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovol, Former Yugoslav Republic&#13;
of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. Croatia may participate in select activities as a partner and&#13;

credible information infrastructure. These activities will include regional workshops and study&#13;
trips for those in charge of the audit QA function within PAOs or audit public oversight&#13;
institutions in beneficiary countries, following the CoP methodology; and the development of&#13;
methodological tools adapted to the local context for applying ISA and for monitoring their&#13;
application.&#13;
(iv)   Supporting an on-going dialogue with banks, PAOs, chambers of commerce, and&#13;
business associations to develop a common understanding of financial information required&#13;

ï»¿build upon the REPARIS program and integrates the assessment of reform needs with support for&#13;
drawing up and implementing corporate financial reporting reforms.&#13;
As well as being a requirement of EU accession, strong financial reporting systems with reporting&#13;
requirements that reflect the needs of different types of businesses help in several ways to create a&#13;
business climate which supports sustainable economic growth and reduces the barriers facing high-&#13;
potential small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) and the corporate sector at large.&#13;
In this context, the countries of the Western Balkans have expressed strong interest in a new program&#13;
to support the next phase of financial reporting reform, placing particular emphasis on completing the&#13;
process of aligning their national frameworks for financial reporting with the relevant provisions of the&#13;
acquis, while fostering the development of SMEs with the potential for rapid growth.&#13;
(i)    Link with other programs&#13;
As part of TA WB-EDIF, the proposed EU-REPARIS Activities will deliver policy advice and&#13;
technical support in partnership with the other institutions such as the European Commission (EC),&#13;
Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development OECD, European Investment&#13;
Bank/European Investment Fund (EIB/EIF) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
(EBRD) and will work with EU institutions responsible for policy in this area and national institutions&#13;
supporting private sector development in the region.&#13;
The EU-REPARIS Activities will build on the significant work completed under the REPARIS&#13;
program by helping the countries of the Western Balkans to complete alignment of their financial&#13;
reporting laws with the acquis communautaire in a way that reduces the barriers to the growth of&#13;
enterprises and particularly high-potential SMEs and also assists them to develop the capacity to&#13;
implement the acquis effectively. In addition, EU-REPARIS Activities will help local financial&#13;
reporting practitioners provide relevant expert advice to assist high-potential SMEs in moving to the&#13;
next stage of their development and, where appropriate, in facilitating access to sources of venture&#13;
capital.&#13;
(ii)  Regional approach&#13;
The EU-REPARIS Activities are organized on a regional basis, complemented by national initiatives&#13;
to support financial reporting reform.&#13;
The participant countries have a shared goal of accession to the EU and also face many common&#13;
challenges in setting up effective systems of financial reporting and fostering the growth of SMEs. The&#13;
regional approach of the proposed EU-REPARIS Activities helps participating countries tackle these&#13;
shared issues together, while learning from each other's experiences.&#13;
A regional approach will also enhance the convening power of the EU-REPARIS Activities and&#13;
provide a coordinating framework for reforms to be implemented at the country level, thus&#13;
contributing to the creation of a single economic space in the Western Balkans. These activities will be&#13;
tailored to the particular needs of the countries taking part in EU-REPARIS activities.&#13;
3.     Implementation arrangements&#13;
The EU-REPARIS Activities will be Bank executed and will be led by the World Bank's specialized&#13;
unit in corporate financial reporting for the Europe and Central Asia region, the Centre for Financial&#13;
Reporting Reform (CFRR).&#13;
A monitoring group of senior officials from Ministries of Finance and/or Ministries of Economy from&#13;
the participating countries that will review the progress of EU-REPARIS will be set up by not later&#13;
than June 30, 2014. This will help to ensure appropriate participating countries' sustained commitment&#13;
to the EU-REPARIS Activities.&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿A stakeholders' group, bringing together market participants from the region, foreign investors and&#13;
other stakeholders will be set up by not later than June 30, 2014 to allow market participants' and&#13;
other interested stakeholders' insights to improve the design and implementation of EU-REPARIS.&#13;
In order to ensure an appropriate level of coordination with other activities implemented under the TA&#13;
WB-EDIF, CFRR representatives will attend the EDIF Platform Advisory Group (PAG) meetings and&#13;
present planned activities and report on deliverables and progress made. Program plans and progress&#13;
reports for EU-REPARIS Activities will be shared with the other PAG members for coordination&#13;
purposes. They will also serve as inputs for reporting on the overall TA WB-EDIF program.&#13;
