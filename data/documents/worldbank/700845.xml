AB.STRACT&#13;
Using published census data. this paper describes the spatial&#13;
structure of the eight metropolitan regions of Brazil during 1940-1980. The&#13;
analysis shows that the experience of these regions is similar to what has&#13;
been observed in the developed as weLl as some other developing countries.&#13;
The growth of population and empLoyment in these areas has been rapid but its&#13;
speed has been associated with the size of the region. Both population and&#13;
employment in large metropolitan regions have deconcentrated, while they have&#13;
concentrated in the smaller regions. Employment is spatially more&#13;
concentrated than is population. Large establishments in manufacturing tend&#13;
to be located in the periphery of cities. The reverse trend is observed for&#13;
commerce establishments.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
This paper forms part of a large program of research grouped under&#13;
the rubric of the "City Study" of Bogota, Colombia, which was conducted at the&#13;
World Bank with the collaboration of Corporacion Centro Regional de Poblacion,&#13;
Bogota. The goal of the City Study was to increase our understanding of the&#13;
workings of five major urban sectors--housing, transport, employment location,&#13;
labor markets, and the public sector--in order that the impact of policies and&#13;
projects can be assessed more accurately.&#13;
The author would Like to thank Gregory K. Ingram, Kyu Sik Lee, and&#13;
other members of the City Study research staff at the World Bank and at the&#13;
Corporacion Centro Regional de Poblacion in Bogota for comments on the work&#13;
presented here, with particular application to Anna Sant'Anna, who organized&#13;
and supervised the collection of the census data and Rakesh Mohan, who edited&#13;
the final manuscript.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
This paper investigates the growth and distribution of population and&#13;
employment in the eight metropolitan regions of Brazil: Sao Paulo, Rio de&#13;
Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Recife, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Fortaleza, and&#13;
Curitiba. Specifically it attempts to decide whether the growth and&#13;
distribution of population and employment of these regions exhibit strong&#13;
regularities and deconcentration observed in most developed and other&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
The main body of this paper is composed of four sections. Section II&#13;
discusses the growth and distribution of population and compares them among&#13;
and within the metropolitan regions. Section III examines the deconcentration&#13;
of employment and establishment in the manufacturing industry and commerce.&#13;
Section IV presents estimated population and employment density gradients and&#13;
compares them among the regions and changes in gradients over time. Section V&#13;
summarizes the findings of this study.&#13;
II. TRENDS OF POPULATION GROWTH AND STRUCTURES IN METROPOLITAN REGIONS&#13;
The eight regions being studied are three metropolitan regions&#13;
(Fortaleza, Recife, Salvador) located in the northeast which is generally poor&#13;
and less developed and five metropolitan regions (Rio de Janeiro, Belo&#13;
Horizonte, Sao Paulo, Curitiba, Porto Alegre) in the southeast where economic&#13;
growth has been fast. Except for Curitiba, all the regions had a population&#13;
of more than one milLion in 1970. These metropolitan regions were created to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
centralize planning and public service delivery for large urban areas of the&#13;
country and to provide a revenue sharing system among the municipalities with-&#13;
in these regions. Belem is not studied in this paper due to data problems.&#13;
The first problem was to construct a consistent boundary of&#13;
metropolitan regions over the time period being studied (1940-1980 census&#13;
years).  Census data were used for municipalities 1-  in each region and it was&#13;
possible to roughly define the same geographic regions for the previous years&#13;
as in 1970 (see Table 1 in Annex). 2/ Each region is divided into two areas,&#13;
city and ring, to study the spatial structure of the metropolitan regions.&#13;
City is defined as the municipality at the core of the region and the rest of&#13;
the region is defined as ring.&#13;
The metropolitan regions are very important in Brazil. The total&#13;
population of the eight regions in 1970 was more than twenty-three million,&#13;
roughly one-fourth of the total population of the country. The growth of&#13;
population in the eight regions has been faster than the nation as a whole.&#13;
Table I shows that between 1940 and 1980, the total population of the eight&#13;
regions more than quadrupled while the nation's population less than&#13;
tripled. With this rapid growth, the population share of the eight regions to&#13;
the nation increased from 15.9 percent to 28.9 percent during the same period.&#13;
The population growth in the eight regions has been rapid but its&#13;
magnitude varies among the regions and the time periods observed. For all&#13;
regions except for Sao Paulo and Curitiba, the growth rate in the fifties was&#13;
higher than in any other decade. While large regions like Sao Paulo and Rio&#13;
de Janeiro show higher growth rates in the forties than in the sixties or&#13;
seventies, smaller regions like Fortaleza, Salvador and Curitiba show larger&#13;
growth rates in the sixties and seventies. Regions like Recife and Salvador&#13;

-/  The population figures of 1940-70 in this table and other parts of this paper are resident population living in&#13;
private dwelling unit5.  In other words, they exclude population in public institutions such as hospitals, mental&#13;
institutions, military units, etc.  The total of this population in the eight metropolitan regions in 1970 was about&#13;
3.9 percent of the total resident population in private dwelling units.  The population of 1980 and in parentheses&#13;
for 1970 are total residents. The annual population growth rates during 1970-80 are computed using the&#13;
corresponding figures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
experienced stable growth of population while Curitiba and Belo Horizonte went&#13;
through wide variations in their growth rates. Close analysis shows that the&#13;
growth rate is large when the population of the regions ranges from 400,000-&#13;
1,500,000. This growth pattern is consistent with the typical growth pattern&#13;
observed in other countries, i.e., average growth rates decline slightly with&#13;
size.&#13;
In addition, population growth has not been distributed evenly within&#13;
the metropolitan regions. The average growth rate in the rings of the eight&#13;
regions is 4.8 percent, while the rate in the cities is slightly less than 4.0&#13;
percent. For the large regions, population in rings has grown faster than&#13;
that in the cities. For the small regions, the reverse trend is observed.&#13;
Table 2 shows that the share of population in the cities has been&#13;
stable in the forties and fifties and has decreased since then. It also&#13;
indicates that large regions tend to deconcentrate and small regions tend to&#13;
concentrate. The two largest regions, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have&#13;
experienced large amounts of deconcentration during the last four decades.&#13;
The two smallest regions, Fortaleza and Curitiba, went through rapid&#13;
concentration during 1940-1970 and stabilized since then. While the percent&#13;
of people living in the city of Sao Paulo decreased from 84.6 in 1940 to 67.5&#13;
in 1980, the same figures of Curitiba increased from 43.4 to 66.3. In medium&#13;
regions like Porto Alegre and Recife, the share of the city population&#13;
remained steady. Careful examination of Tables 1 and 2 reveals that&#13;
population tends to concentrate until the size of the region reaches about one&#13;
million and remains stable when it ranges from 1 million to 1.5 million. When&#13;
the population grows more than 1.5 million, the region tends to deconcentrate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
Population densities both in the cities and the rings of all&#13;
metropolitan regions have increased but their magnitudes vary. Although the&#13;
density in the cities of large regions like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo has&#13;
grown at a smaller rate than that in rings, the density in the cities of small&#13;
regions, Fortaleza and Curitiba for example, has increased faster than that in&#13;
the rings. Of the eight regions, Recife experiences the highest densities&#13;
both in the city and ring. Curitiba has the lowest densities. In Curitiba,&#13;
however, the density in the city increased by more than ten times while the&#13;
density in the ring remained almost at the same level. In Porte Alegre,&#13;
densities of both city and ring went up by a similar growth rate. (see Table&#13;
2 in Annex.)&#13;

Table 3 shows the distribution of the general population and migrants&#13;
living for less than one year in the metropolitan regions. The share of&#13;
migrants in cities is higher than that of the general population in the two&#13;
smallest regions only, FortaLeza and Curitiba. For the rest of the regions,&#13;
migrants are more likely than the general population to live in rings and this&#13;
reinforces the overall deconcentration trend. Column 3 of this table shows&#13;
the share of total migrants out of total population. Slightly less than five&#13;
percent of the population are migrants and the share of migrants does not seem&#13;
to have any relationship with the size of cities.&#13;

III. SPATIAL DECONCENTRATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND ESTABLISHMENTS&#13;
The previous section discussed the growth and the distribution of the&#13;
popuLation in the eight metropolitan regions, with special emphasis on the&#13;
concentration - deconcentration of the population over time. This section is&#13;
concerned with the redistribution of employment and establishments of&#13;
manufacturing and commerce in these regions.&#13;
In 1970, more than one third of the total labor force in the eight&#13;
metropolitan regions was engaged in manufacturing and about 13 percent was in&#13;
commerce. The growth of totaL employment in these industries, as in the case&#13;
of population, has been rapid. Growth in commerce, however, has been faster&#13;
than that in manufacturing. Between 1940 and 1970, total employment in&#13;
commerce almost quadrupled (from 189,000 to 747,000) while that in&#13;
manufacturing grew almost three-fold (from 495,000 to 1,550,000). In&#13;
addition, the growth in commerce shows small variance among the regions, while&#13;
the growth in manufacturing has a large variance. As expected, the growtn of&#13;
employment in both industries has a relationship with that of population.&#13;
Employment in manufacturing and commerce in Sao Paulo and Forteleza, for&#13;
example, had grown more than six times during 1940-1970. Both regions have&#13;
experienced higher than average growth rates of population. Rio de Janeiro&#13;
and Curitiba have experienced a modest growth rate both in employment and&#13;
population.&#13;
Table 4 shows that, both in manufacturing and commerce, the aggregate&#13;
share of cities in total employment 32 of the eight regions has decreased over&#13;
time. In manufacturing employment, the share of cities decreased from 81.8&#13;
percent in 1940 to 68.0 percent in 1970.  In commerce, it decreased from 89.4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
to 82.9 in the forties and stabilized since then. Also, employment in both&#13;
industries has been spatiaLLy more concentrated than population. The speed of&#13;
deconcentration of employment, however, has been much faster than that of&#13;
population. In addition, employment in commerce has been spatially more&#13;
concentrated than that in manufacturing. This observation is consistent with&#13;
what has been experienced in the developed and other deveLoping countries&#13;
(Mills, 1972, and Mills and Song, 1977).&#13;
The speed of spatial deconcentration of employment has varied among&#13;
the metropolitan regions. The large regions have experienced rapid&#13;
deconcentration while the small regions have remained stable. The share of&#13;
employment in manufacturing in the city of Sao Paulo, the Largest region,&#13;
decreased from 97.2 percent in 1940 to 71.0 percent in 1970. The same figure&#13;
of Curitiba, the smallest region, decreased from 74.9 percent to 73.0 percent&#13;
during the same period.&#13;
The table also shows that the share of establishments in manufactur-&#13;
ing in the cities of eight regions was stable (73.8 percent in 1940 and 71.1&#13;
percent in 1970), while the share in commerce decreased from 80.5 percent in&#13;
1940 to 71.9 percent in 1970. The total employment in manufacturing in the&#13;
eight regions was spatially more concentrated than establishments in 1940 and&#13;
1950. In 1970, however, employment was less concentrated than establish-&#13;
ments. In commerce, total employment was more concentrated than establish-&#13;
ments throughout the period being studied. This indicates that larger&#13;
establishments in manufacturing were located in cities and smaller establish-&#13;
ments were in rings during the forties and fifties and the trend reversed in&#13;
the sixties, i.e., larger establishments were located in rings. In commerce,&#13;
large establishments tended to be located in the cities for all periods. This&#13;
tendency may be due to externalities. The agglomeration effect in commerce&#13;
may be more important for larger establishments than for the smaller ones.&#13;

IV. POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT DENSITY FUNCTIONS&#13;
Though the data analyzed in the previous sections can reveal the&#13;
broad trend of the growth and redistribution of population and employment,&#13;
they are subject to limitations. First of all, the distinction between the&#13;
city and the ring does not provide a unique measure of spatiaL deconcentration&#13;
since the percent of the land area included in the city differs greatly among&#13;
the metropolitan regions (see Table 1 in Annex). Second, the boundaries of&#13;
some cities have changed over time, mainly because the city was subdivided and&#13;
part of it became a separate municipality or annexed to another&#13;
municipality. Though the changes in the boundaries of these cities have been&#13;
adjusted, there are still some variations in the definition over time to the&#13;
extent that it is not possible to construct exactly the same boundaries for&#13;
four decades. Thus, it is desirable to have a measure of deconcentration that&#13;
does not depend upon the historical or political criteria of the city boundary&#13;
locations. Third, the city and ring dichotomy yields data aggregated across&#13;
space. For some purposes, it would be desirable to measure changes in&#13;
location patterns within the cities and within the rings. Also, the&#13;
descriptive tables presented in the previous sections do not allow easy and&#13;
clear cross-regional comparisons of deconcentration. These limitations can be&#13;
surmounted by employing the commonly used assumption that population densities&#13;
decline exponentially with distance from the center.&#13;
D(x) = D0 e bx&#13;
where D(x) is density of the population at distance x from the city center, b&#13;
is the gradient (i.e., description of how rapidly the density function falls&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
off with distance), and Do is the intercept (i.e., population at the city&#13;
center).&#13;
The parameters obtained from the functions, D0 and b, can be used to&#13;
characterize the distribution of population within the metropolitan regions&#13;
and provide insights about the urban spatial structure. The larger b is, the&#13;
faster density falls with distance, which suggests that b can be used as a&#13;
measure of deconcentration. In other words, the share of total population&#13;
within a given distance from the center is uniquely related to b. These&#13;
density functions are easy to compare both among cities and points in time.&#13;
It is thus not difficult to study whether there are regularities in the&#13;
density either by comparing different cities or different countries at a given&#13;
time or by observing a city or a country over time.&#13;
Two most commonly used methods to estimate the exponential density&#13;
function are the ordinary least-square and the two-point estimate technique.&#13;
If data is available on population and distance from the center for a large&#13;
number of small land areas, census tracts in the U.S., for example, ordinary&#13;
least-squares regressions can be used. Alternatively, since the function is a&#13;
two-parameter curve, we can estimate the gradient and central density using&#13;
only information on the population and the area of the city and the ring.&#13;
This technique called two-point estimate was first developed and later&#13;
modified by Mills (1972), and evaluated by White (1977)4/. In the absense of&#13;
the information required for regression estimation, the two-point estimation&#13;
procedure has an obvious advantage and was adopted for this study.&#13;
Table 5 displays how the estimated density gradient and central&#13;
density vary across the regions and how they change over time. Change in the&#13;
density gradient over time shows three different patterns depending on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
size of the regions. In large metropolitan regions like Sao Paulo and Rio de&#13;
Janeiro, the gradient flattens slowly and in small regions like Fortaleza and&#13;
Curitiba, it becomes steeper rapidly. In regions of medium size (Porto Alegre&#13;
and Belo Horizonte), the value of the gradient remains almost constant. Also&#13;
the absolute value of the gradient shows a wide variance among the regions:&#13;
from 0.0646 in Rio de Janeiro in 1980 to 0.2675 in Belo Horizonte in 1960.&#13;
The central density or the intercept (D0) increases in all metropolitan&#13;
regions over time and the rate of growth is higher in small regions. Central&#13;
density in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro is high but the gradient is low. In&#13;
Recife and Belo Horizonte, both the density and gradient are high. It is&#13;
interesting to note that while the gradient in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro&#13;
decreases over time, the central density increases. This observation suggests&#13;
that the effects of the rapid growth of population have more than offset the&#13;
effects of the deconcentration. In addition, while the value of gradient&#13;
shows a pattern of relationship with the size of the regions, central density&#13;
does not seem to have any association with it. Large regions tend to be&#13;
associated with low gradient and smaller regions tend to have high gradient.&#13;
Comparison of the gradients and densities among the countries reveals&#13;
interesting information.- The average density gradient of the eight&#13;
metropolitan regions in Brazil computed for three decades (1950-1970) is&#13;
0.151, which is higher than the average gradient of 0.132 computed for the&#13;
twelve cities of the United States by Ingram and Carroll (1981). While the&#13;
average gradient in Brazil increases from 0.148 in 1950 to 0.171 in 1970, the&#13;
same figure in the U.S. decreases, from 0.153 to 0.113. During the same&#13;
period the average central density in the U.S. also decreases, from 13,504 to&#13;
9,670.  In Brazil, it increases from 5,111 to 13,074.  As observed, the values&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
of the average gradient and the average density of Brazil in 1970 are much&#13;
higher than those of the U.S. However, the density of the eight metropolitan&#13;
regions of Brazil is much lower than that of the twelve Korean metropolitan&#13;
areas estimated by Mills and ong (1977) or the twelve Indian metropolitan&#13;
areas computed by Mills and Tan (1980).6/&#13;
Estimation of the population density gradients has been one of Lhe&#13;
popular procedures to describe the shifts in the structures of cities. The&#13;
number of previous studies on the population density function in developed&#13;
countries are countless and a few studies have been made in developing&#13;
countries in recent years. Estimation of density function for employment,&#13;
however, is scarce in developed countries and virtually non-existent in&#13;
developing countries.Z' One reason for this scarcity is that employment data&#13;
are not easily available, especially in developing countries. This study&#13;
calculates the employment density function using the same technique as the one&#13;
used to estimate population density gradient. It provides a useful&#13;
descriptive summary and an interesting comparison between the deconcentration&#13;
of population and that of employment.&#13;
Table 6 shows the employment density gradient and the central density&#13;
in manufacturing and commerce. As in the case of the population density&#13;
function, the slope of the gradient varies among the regions depending on the&#13;
size of the regions. The gradient also declines over time in large reasons&#13;
like Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Porto Alegre and increases in small&#13;
regions such as Salvador and Curitiba. With this opposite movement of the&#13;
slope, the average density gradient of the eight regions has remained constant&#13;
over time, 0,.169 in 1940 and 0.161 in 1970. Central density, however,&#13;
increases in almost all regions.&#13;

The density gradient of commerce in Table 6 shows a similar pattern&#13;
of change over time to manufacturing. While in large regions like Sao Paulo&#13;
and Rio de Janeiro the gradient becomes flatter, it becomes steeper in small&#13;
regions. Central density in commerce also increases in most of the cases&#13;
displayed in the table. The gradient in commerce has higher value than that&#13;
in manufacturing for most of the metropolitan regions. The average gradient&#13;
of 0.229 in commerce is compared to 0.166 in manufacturing. This observation&#13;
provides evidence that employment in commerce in general is more concentrated&#13;
in the center of the city than that in manufacturing. The employment density&#13;
gradient in manufacturing is slightly higher than the population density&#13;
gradient. The average density gradient in manufacturing is slightly higher&#13;
than the population density gradient. The average density gradient in&#13;
manufacturing is 0.166 and the same figure for population is 0.151. This&#13;
observation supports the statement made at the beginning of this section that&#13;
employment is located closer to the city center than is population. Also&#13;
commerce is more concentrated to the center than manufacturing.&#13;

As a comparison, Table 7 displays employment density function&#13;
parameters for the twelve U.S. cities, estimated using aggregate employment&#13;
data of all industries.8/ The absolute magnitudes of the density gradients in&#13;
the U.S. cities are significantly less than those observed in the eight&#13;
metropolitan regions of Brazil. Out of the twelve U.S. cities, in only two&#13;
cities are the density gradients larger than 0.2 (Washington, D.C. and&#13;
Denver), and in four of the cities, the parameters are less than 0.1.&#13;
Compared to this observation, in four of the eight regions of Brazil, the&#13;
density gradients of commerce in 1970 are higher than 0.2 and no gradient is&#13;
lower than 0.1. In manufacturing industry, three gradients in 1970 are higher&#13;
than 0.2 and only two gradients are lower than 0.1. The average gradient of&#13;
the twelve U.S. cities is 0.1381. The average gradients of manufacturing and&#13;
commerce in the eight regions are 0.152 and 0.231 respectively.&#13;
V. CONCLUSION&#13;
This paper has been concerned with the changing spatiaL structure of&#13;
the eight metropolitan regions of Brazil from 1940 to 1980. The rapid growth&#13;
of population in these regions during the past decades may slow down a little&#13;
in the next decades. Analysis of the previous experiences shows that the&#13;
growth rate of population is high when the size of a region ranges from 0.4 to&#13;
1.5 million people. In 1980, all the regions had a population of more than&#13;
1.5 million.&#13;
A cross regional comparison shows that at a given time large&#13;
metropolitan regions tend to have flatter density functions than small&#13;
regions. While the large regions experience deconcentration over time, the&#13;
small ones first go through concentration. The trend of deconcentration of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
popuLation and employment in large regions may continue in the future but the&#13;
concentration in small regions may decline. The patterns of shift in&#13;
employment density function and population density function are found to be&#13;
similar. Regions with a steep population density gradient tend to be&#13;
assocIated with a high employment density gradient. Regions experiencing&#13;
deconcentration in popuLation also go through spatiaL deconcentration in&#13;
employment. In addition, close examination of the pace of deconcentration and&#13;
concentration of population and employment suggests that redistribution of&#13;
population is more rapid than that of employment.&#13;
A few studies made recently on the developed and the developing&#13;
countries (Ingram and Carroll, 1981; Mills and Tan, 1978; Mills and Song,&#13;
1977; and Mohan and Villamizar, 1982), show that the distribution of&#13;
population within cities is fairly regular and that deconcentration is&#13;
observed not only in the developed countries but also in the developing&#13;
countries. They also show that land use in the cities of Asia and Latin&#13;
America is more compact than that of the cities of North America. In general,&#13;
the results of the present study are similar to what have been found in other&#13;
studies. However, this does not mean that this general conclusion can be&#13;
applied to all of the individual regions. As shown in the tables of the&#13;
previous sections, there are many exceptions. Various factors affect density&#13;
patterns in an urban area: the local characteristics of housing construction,&#13;
the mix of various industries, scarcity of land, structure of transportation&#13;
system, the rate of growth in real income and population, and car ownership.&#13;
Since these fractors are different among the cities and among countries, the&#13;
pattern of density may also be different.&#13;

FOOTNOTES&#13;
The Municipio in Brazil is the smallest government unit comparable to the&#13;
county in the U.S. The number of municipios in the nation was 4,362 in&#13;
1972, and they showed a great variation in area and population. The&#13;
municipio has both an executive branch headed by a mayor (prefeito) and a&#13;
legislative branch called camara de vereadores. The municipio council&#13;
legislates on matters of local interest such as budgeting, local taxes,&#13;
city plan and it controls the mayor. For more details, see Area Handbook&#13;
for Brazil, Thomas E. Weil, et al, third edition, 1975, p. 229.&#13;
2/ The boundaries of the metropolitan regions defined in this paper are&#13;
slightly larger than the official definitions used for census data. Since&#13;
the boundaries of the metropolitan regions are defined by the collection&#13;
of municipalities and the boundaries of some municipalities have been&#13;
changed over time, it is not possible to construct a consistent and&#13;
exactly the same boundary for four decades as the official definition.&#13;
3   The employment figures being discussed in this paper includes all&#13;
establishments regardless of their size. The Census of Industries for&#13;
1960 was published partially and the quality of the published data is&#13;
poor. Anyway, those data were not available for this study.&#13;
4/ The result of the White study is that the properties of the two-point&#13;
estimates depend somewhat on the fraction of cities that are included in&#13;
the inner and outer divisions. However, the extent of the bias is not&#13;
great for the density gradient. He concludes that, overall, two-point&#13;
estimates perform about as well as ordinary least squares.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5/ Comparison of the density function among the countries should be made very&#13;
carefully, especially when the function is computed using different&#13;
estimation techniques. In computing the density gradient for the twelve&#13;
cities of the U.S., Ingram and Carroll (1981) used the two-point estimate&#13;
technique, the same method used in this study. Mills and Tan (1980)&#13;
estimated the function for Korea and India by ordinary least square&#13;
regressions. They also estimated the gradient for the four regions of&#13;
Brazil, which are the same regions being studied in this paper: Sao&#13;
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Recife and Belo Horizonte. The author compared the&#13;
results of their study of these regions with those of this study. The&#13;
differences in the results of the two studies are not large. The author&#13;
therefore feels that it is reasonably safe to make comparison among the&#13;
results obtained by different studies.&#13;
6/ The twelve Korean metropolitan areas included in the study by Mills and&#13;
Song (1977) were Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Cwangju, Incheon, Daejeon, Cheongju,&#13;
Andong, Suwon, Cheonan, Cangreung and Samcheonpo. The average density&#13;
gradients for these areas for 1966, 1970 and 1973 were 0.701, 0.670 and&#13;
0.639, respectively. The twelve Indian metropolitan areas included in the&#13;
study by Mills and Tan (1980) were Poona City, Howrah, Hubli, Gaya,&#13;
Dharwar, Madras, Bombay, Jamshedpur, Hyderabad (Old City), Secunderabad,&#13;
Bangalore and Bangalore Civil and Military Section. The average density&#13;
gradients for these areas for 1951 and 1961 were 0.672 and 0.652,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
7/ Mills (1972) estimated the density function for manufacturing, retailing,&#13;
services, and wholesaling employment in 18 metropolitan areas of the U.S.&#13;
during 1948-1963. Recently, Kemper and Schmenner (1974) estimated the&#13;
density gradients of employment and establishments for manufacturing&#13;
industry and ten two-digit manufacturing industries in five U.S. cities&#13;
for 1967 and 1971. Pachon (1979) estimated the employment density&#13;
function for Bogota, Colombia using the data of Phase Two Household Survey&#13;
carried out during 1971-1972.&#13;
8/ The disaggregated employment data of manufacturing and commerce of these&#13;
cities are not readily available.&#13;

            The spatial structure of the metropolitan
            regions of Brazil
        </repnme>

            It is well known that there is a strong
            relationship between urbanization and economic development
            in many countries of the world.  Urbanization provides many
            benefits to the economy, such as efficient allocation of
            resources and economies of scale.  In addition, urbanization
            in developing countries is much faster than has been
            experienced historically by developed countries.  This paper
            describes the spatial structure of the eight metropolitan
            regions of Brazil during 1940-80.  The analysis shows that
            the experience of these regions is similar to what has been
            observed in the developed and some other developing
            countries.  The growth of population and employment in these
            areas has been rapid but its speed has been associated with
            the size of the region.  Both population and employment in
            large metropolitan regions have deconcentrated, while they
            have concentrated in small regions.  Employment is spatially
            more concentrated than is population. Large establishments
            in manufacturing tend to be located in the rings.  The
            reverse trend is observed in commerce.
