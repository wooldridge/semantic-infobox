&amp;#12;                                              FOREWORD&#13;
&#13;
It is my pleasure to present the 11th edition of the Kenya Economic Update. Kenya begins 2015 in a sound&#13;
 economic position. It is experiencing solid growth, driven by sustained infrastructure investments, strong&#13;
growth in other industry sector, and strong agricultural production. At last Kenya is emerging as one of East&#13;
Africaâ&#128;&#153;s growth centers.&#13;
&#13;
Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s macroeconomic policies have laid a strong foundation for future growth. Its expansive fiscal policy&#13;
allowed it to finance infrastructure projects without putting excessive pressure on domestic financial markets&#13;
while keeping public debt within the 50 percent threshold. Its accommodative monetary policy stance has&#13;
supported economic activities without triggering inflation or putting pressure on the exchange rate. This&#13;
overall positive outlook is, however, not without risks. The tourist sector has been hobbled through reports&#13;
and concerns about security that has hit economic activities at the coast especially hard.&#13;
&#13;
This Economic Update (KEU edition 11) has three main messages. First, Kenya is poised to be among the&#13;
fastest-growing economies in the region in the next three years, with growth projections of 6.0 percent in&#13;
2015, 6.6 percent in 2016, and 7.0 percent in 2017. External and internal balances are expected to improve&#13;
significantly, thanks to falling oil prices, and public investment, mainly in infrastructure (energy and the&#13;
standard gauge railway), is expected to firm up growth in the medium term.&#13;
&#13;
Second, the external sector remains vulnerable, as import growth continue to outpace export growth and&#13;
short-term flows finance the current account deficit. Sluggish external demand for exports and declining&#13;
production for export is widening the current account deficit. These trends point toward underlying structural&#13;
weaknesses that need to be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
Third, Kenya needs to increase the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector so that it contributes more&#13;
to growth and employment. Over a long period, the relative size of the sector has been stagnant, it has lost&#13;
market share abroad, and it is struggling with structural inefficiencies. Low overall productivity and large&#13;
productivity differences in firms across subsectors point to lack of competition; a more efficient sector would&#13;
do a better job of allocating resources from low-to high-productivity firms, allowing them to grow faster and&#13;
hire more employees.&#13;
&#13;
As in the past, we are proud to have worked with many Kenyan stakeholders during the preparation of&#13;
this Kenya Economic Update. We hope that it will contribute to their discussions of policy issues that will&#13;
contribute to helping Kenya grow, permanently reduce poverty, and bring shared prosperity to all Kenyans.&#13;

                                                       Main messages&#13;
Kenya begins 2015 in a sound economic position. After growing an estimated 5.4 percent in 2014, its economy is&#13;
poised to be among the fastest growing in the region, with growth projected at 6.0 percent in 2015, 6.6 percent in&#13;
2016, and 7.0 percent in 2017. External and internal balances are expected to improve significantly, thanks to falling&#13;
oil prices, and public investment, mainly in infrastructure (energy and the standard gauge railway), is expected to&#13;
firm up growth in the medium term.&#13;
&#13;
The external sector remains weak and vulnerable, as import growth continue to outpace export growth and short-&#13;
term flows finance the current account deficit. Sluggish external demand for exports, especially from the Euro area&#13;
and emerging economies, has contributed to the widening of the current account deficit in the recent past. The large&#13;
deficit points to underlying structural weaknesses in Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economy, which need to be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
Kenya needs to increase the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector so that it can grow, export, and create&#13;
much-needed jobs. As a share of GDP, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s manufacturing sector has been stagnant in recent years, and it has&#13;
lost international market share. Low overall productivity and large productivity differences in firms across subsectors&#13;
point to lack of competition (which allows low-productivity firms to remain in business).&#13;
&#13;
The weak business environment is a key constraint for the manufacturing sector. Obstacles to doing business affect&#13;
this sector more than many others because manufacturing needs access to capital for investments, infrastructure&#13;
to import inputs and export and distribute finished products, affordable and reliable electricity to produce, labor to&#13;
man operations, and fair and streamlined regulations and trade policies that allow firms to compete. Several policy&#13;
actions could help anchor growth and galvanize the manufacturing sector:&#13;
&#13;
                                Key recommendations to anchor and sustain growth at high level&#13;
1.	 To anchor and sustain growth, Kenya needs to boost productivity and regain its competitiveness to encourage&#13;
    production of exports. To maintain high growth rates, Kenya needs to continue investing in infrastructure and&#13;
    human capital, improve the business and regulatory environment, and diversify exports. Increasing exports, is&#13;
    crucial for creating the thousands of low-skilled jobs needed to reduce high unemployment, particularly among&#13;
    young people, unemployment among whom poses a threat to social stability.&#13;
&#13;
2.	 Address the risks associated with fiscal expansion, and rebuild policy buffers in the short to medium term&#13;
    to address fiscal sustainability. Recent public investment initiatives have started to generate a virtuous cycle&#13;
    between economic growth and debt sustainability. But the reduced fiscal space has left the economy vulnerable&#13;
    to exogenous shocks. In a similar way, the recent Eurobond issue helped integrate Kenya into global markets but&#13;
    increased its vulnerability to external shocks. To protect against such vulnerabilities and be in a position to handle&#13;
    adverse shocks, the government needs to preserve and rebuild fiscal policy buffers.&#13;
                    Key recommendations for increasing the contribution of the manufacturing sector&#13;
3.	 Adopt cross-sectoral policies, such as removing market distortions and implementing industry-wide productivity&#13;
    policies, to complement sector-specific approaches. Policies should address inefficiencies in the capacity of&#13;
    the economy to allocate resources from low- to high-productivity firms. This means that trade policy, business&#13;
    regulatory frameworks, labor market laws, and access to finance should facilitate and enable firms to compete,&#13;
    both domestically and internationally.&#13;
&#13;
4.	 Support the manufacturing sector, by:&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 Helping raise firm productivity growth by facilitating the stock and flow of skills, technology, and information&#13;
        among firms;&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 Levelling the playing field between formal and informal firms, by reducing and streamlining regulation, and&#13;
        ensuring their even and fair application;&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 Decreasing the cost of doing business by addressing critical issues related to energy, access to finance,&#13;
        and cross-border trade (both cargo clearance and non-tariff barriers), as well as devolution and countiesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
        revenue-raising business levies&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 Streamlining the process for starting a business and simplifying the insolvency framework&#13;

&#13;
    K      enya may be emerging as one of East Africaâ&#128;&#153;s growth centers. It is experiencing solid growth,&#13;
           driven by sustained infrastructure investments, buoyant manufacturing and other industry&#13;
        sectors, and strong agricultural production. Buoyed by declines in the price of crude oil, annual&#13;
        growth is projected to pick up from an estimated 5.4 percent in 2014 to 6.0â&#128;&#147;7.0 percent in 2015-17,&#13;
        making Kenya one of the fastest-growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is a challenge to&#13;
        ensure that most Kenyans benefit from this high growth as poverty rates and inequality remained&#13;
        high. To ensure that Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s growth momentum is sustainable in the medium term, key steps for&#13;
        Kenya to take include fully implementing the business reform agenda, completing reforms at the&#13;
        port of Mombasa, improving the efficiency of its massive infrastructural projects, strengthening&#13;
        governance, and continuing to maintain macroeconomic stability.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Growth in 2014 was broad based. On the supply side,     The external sector remained weak and vulnerable,&#13;
agricultural production saw robust growth, driven       as import growth outpaced export growth and&#13;
by increased use of high-quality inputs; increased      short-term flows financed the current account&#13;
livestock output, as a result of better pasture;        deficit. Sluggish external demand for exports,&#13;
and expanded credit to the sector. A favorable          especially from the Euro area and emerging&#13;
macroeconomic environmentâ&#128;&#148;low inflation, a              economies, contributed to the widening of the&#13;
stable exchange rate, expanded private creditâ&#128;&#148;as        current account deficit. The level of the deficit points&#13;
well as more reliable supply and lower prices of        to underlying structural weaknesses in Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
electricity boosted manufacturing output. On the        economy that need to be addressed. Merchandise&#13;
demand side, aggregate demand was the main driver       exports have weakened significantly since 2012,&#13;
of growth, as private consumption rose, as a result     and high oil prices (until 2014) drove import&#13;
of increased credit, and government consumption         growth. Import needs and financing inflows for large&#13;
increased at both the national and subnational          infrastructural investment projects added pressure&#13;

&amp;#12;The State of Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s Economy&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
1. Economic performance in 2014&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          K      enya is where it wants to beâ&#128;&#148;on a higher growth path. Massive investments in infrastructural&#13;
                 investments, a favorable external borrowing environment, and a strong economy have helped boost&#13;
             aggregate domestic demand and growth. The rebased national accounts data depict a more diversified&#13;
             economy than previously thought, with a larger role played by the traditional sectors of agriculture&#13;
             and manufacturing and the emerging sectors of financial intermediation, real estate, and business&#13;
             services. Expansionary fiscal policy has been key in boosting aggregate demand, while accommodative&#13;
             monetary policy has helped support growth by increasing private sector credit and keeping inflation&#13;
             low. As a result, the economy is estimated to have grown 5.4 percent in 2014 and is forecasted to&#13;
             grow 6.0 percent in 2015. Macroeconomic indicators are solid, with inflation expected to remain&#13;
             within the Central Bank target of 5 percent; public debt remaining below 50 percent of GDP; and the&#13;
             current account deficit, which has perennially remained high as a percent of GDP, expected to declined&#13;
             significantly to 4.7 percent in 2017. Risks remain, however. On the domestic front, the weak security&#13;
             environment and fiscal position pose significant risks to growth prospects. On the external front, the&#13;
             winding down of monetary easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the subsequent tightening of global&#13;
             financial conditions could trigger new volatility, which may reduce growth in Kenya, as risk-averse&#13;
             foreign investors change their minds about Kenya, leading to capital outflows. In addition, a deflated&#13;
             Euro area will dampen the export growth pick-up the economy expects to see in the near to long term.&#13;

With a GDP of US$55.2 billion, Kenya is currently                                22.6 percent to 24.0 percent, as a result of new data&#13;
the ninth-largest economy in Africa and the fifth-                               from the cost of agriculture survey, livestock census&#13;

       Box 1.1: Why rebase GDP?&#13;
 The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) uses System of National Accounts (SNA) guidelines in compiling the national&#13;
 accounts statistics. It rebased Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP in 2014 following the recommendations of the 2008 SNA. This revision was the&#13;
 sixth, similar exercises having been conducted in 1957, 1967, 1976, 1986, and 2005.&#13;
&#13;
 GDP rebasing involves replacing old base-year volume and price measures with a more recent base year or process structure.&#13;
 It yields a more accurate snapshot of the economy by updating the production structure; structural changes in relative prices&#13;
 of various products; and consumption patterns, utilization, and acquisition of capital goods. It also incorporates product&#13;
 changes caused by developments and innovations. In Kenya, for example, the mobile revolution has greatly affected the&#13;
 nature and structure of the economyâ&#128;&#148;something the old national accounts did not capture well.&#13;
&#13;
 The rebasing of 2014 involved changing the base year from 2001 to 2009; updating the production structure; updating&#13;
 structural changes in the relative prices of various products and incorporating product changes made because of new&#13;
 developments and innovations; updating the consumption patterns, utilization, and acquisition of capital goods; and&#13;
 adopting the current classification of economic activities.&#13;
&#13;
 The KNBS invited a team of statisticians and economists from the World Bank Group and other international experts to peer&#13;
 review the rebasing exercise. Their findings confirmed that Kenya conducted the rebasing exercise with professionalism,&#13;
 with integrity, and in accordance with the latest international technical standards. The new numbers are credible and&#13;
 constitute an important improvement in Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economic and statistical knowledge base.&#13;

        7.0 percent in 2017. The new projections reflect the stimulus effect of the massive infrastructure&#13;
     investments currently being undertaken by the government and the effects of falling oil prices. These&#13;
     high growth figures are predicated on a sustained demand boost from infrastructure projects as&#13;
     they start coming on line; expansion of productive capacities, especially in electricity production and&#13;
     construction; increased manufacturing output, as a result of cheaper electricity and a weaker shilling;&#13;

     	 The simulation results refer to 2015 not 2016. In the baseline forecast, GDP growth rises to 6 percent in 2015, from 5.4 percent in 2014. In the high-case scenario, GDP&#13;
       growth rises to 6.5 percent in 2015, a full 1 percentage point increase over 2014. A case could be made that growth could reach 7 percent in 2015.&#13;

  	    In the baseline, the price of oil is relatively high (albeit lower than the oil baseline); security concerns continue to hurt tourism;and the current account deficit, though&#13;
       improving, remains relatively large, keeping Kenya vulnerable to a slowdown in capital inflows. Given the relatively large current account deficit, the shilling is likely to&#13;
       remain under pressure. As a result, inflation will be higher than it would otherwise have been, possibly prompting the Central Bank to raise interest rates. All of these&#13;
       risks are reduced in the high-case scenario.&#13;

         Box 3.1: Data used in the analysis&#13;
    The main datasets used in this analysis are the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s 2007 and 2013 Enterprise Surveys, the Kenya National Bureau&#13;
    of Statistics (KNBS) 2010 Census of Industrial Production, the KNBS monthly surveys of industrial production, and the World&#13;
    Bankâ&#128;&#153;s 2015 Doing Business report. Both Enterprise Surveys are available at www.enterprisesurveys.org. The Census of&#13;
    Industrial Production dataset and the monthly surveys of industrial production are available upon request from the KNBS&#13;
    (www.knbs.or.ke). Doing Business can be accessed at www.doingbusiness.org.&#13;
&#13;
    The datasets complement one another. The 2013 Enterprise Survey includes both qualitative and quantitative information&#13;
    on the business constraints firms face. It is based on a sample of 781 firms, 414 of which are in the manufacturing sector.&#13;
    Eighty-three of these firms, including 51 manufacturing firms, also participated in the 2007 Enterprise Survey.&#13;
&#13;
    The KNBS 2010 Census of Industrial Production sampled 2,246 firms, 2,089 of which are in manufacturing. Subsequent data&#13;
    on manufacturing firm performance collected through the monthly KNBS surveys of industrial production (which are based&#13;
    on a smaller sample of firms) are benchmarked to this 2010 census, allowing for some comparisons over time. For the&#13;
    manufacturing sector, the Census and Enterprise Survey samples are similar in terms of average firm age and subsector size.&#13;
&#13;
    Doing Business measures regulations that enhance and constrain business activity at the subnational and national levels. It&#13;
    presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and the protection of property rights that can be compared across&#13;
    189 economies and over time. Subnational Doing Business reports are available for Kenya for 2009 and 2012. The 2012&#13;
    report covers 13 localities.&#13;

  	 The informal sector makes an important contribution to growth, value added, and employment in the manufacturing industry. Although the size of the informal sector is&#13;
    difficult to ascertainâ&#128;&#148;the last survey was conducted in 1999â&#128;&#148;ongoing research suggests it may account for more than 60 percent of leather industry employment and&#13;
    more than 50 percent of furniture industry production. This Special Topic covers formal firms only. Ongoing work on informal firms and microenterprises will analyze the&#13;
    informal sector. For other research on manufacturing, see â&#128;&#156;Firm-Level Innovation and Productivity in Kenyaâ&#128;&#157; (World Bank 2015). In addition to the paper on informal&#13;
    firms and microenterprises, the World Bank is preparing a paper on firm competitiveness in the manufacturing and services sectors, and conducting in-depth research&#13;
    on key subsectors in the manufacturing industry, including leather and leather products, furniture and metal fabrication, food processing, and textiles and apparel.&#13;

Note: Each box shows the difference in productivity between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile of firms. The line in the middle of each box represents the median&#13;
      firm in terms of labor productivity. The narrow lines indicate the dispersion of productivity; the dots outside the line are the extreme values. Labor productivity is&#13;
      measured by value added per worker. See â&#128;&#156;How to Read a Box Plotâ&#128;&#157; (http://practicalstats.labanca.net/index.php?title=The_Box_Plot).&#13;

    When this term is zero, productivity growth is distributed randomly across firms of all sizes. When this term is positive and large, firm productivity and size are&#13;
    correlated (more productive firms grow in size, and less productive firms shrink or exit the market).&#13;

Larger firms in Kenya are not more productive                                          level for an industry or economy as the sum of&#13;

        ignore the tariff harmonization goals of the EAC.&#13;

a favorable external borrowing environment, and a strong economy have helped boost aggregate domestic&#13;
demand and growth. The rebased national accounts data depict a more diversiï¬&#129;ed economy than previously&#13;
thought, with a larger role played by the traditional sectors of agriculture and manufacturing and the&#13;
emerging sectors of ï¬&#129;nancial intermediation, real estate, and business services. Expansionary ï¬&#129;scal policy&#13;
has been key in boosting aggregate demand, while accommodative monetary policy has helped support&#13;
growth by increasing private sector credit and keeping inï¬&#130;ation low. As a result, the economy is estimated&#13;
to have grown 5.4 percent in 2014 and is forecasted to grow 6.0 percent in 2015.&#13;
&#13;
The special focus of this update examines the structural factors underpinning the poor performance of the&#13;
manufacturing sector. Drawing on recent ï¬&#129;rm-level data from the 2010 Industrial Census and the 2013&#13;
Enterprise Survey. It investigates the extent to which the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s lack of dynamism reï¬&#130;ects problems in&#13;
Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s business environment, which compares poorly to regional neighborsâ&#128;&#153; on several&#13;
manufacturing-relevant dimensions.&#13;
&#13;
The report has four main messages: First, Kenya begins 2015 in a sound economic position. After growing an&#13;
estimated 5.4 percent in 2014, its economy is poised to be among the fastest growing in the region, with&#13;
growth projected at 6.0 percent in 2015, 6.6 percent in 2016, and 7.0 percent in 2017. Second, the external&#13;
sector remains weak and vulnerable, as import growth continue to outpace export growth and short-term&#13;
ï¬&#130;ows ï¬&#129;nance the current account deï¬&#129;cit. The large deï¬&#129;cit points to underlying structural weaknesses in&#13;
Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s economy, which need to be addressed. Third, Kenya needs to increase the competitiveness of the&#13;
manufacturing sector so that it can grow, export, and create much-needed jobs. As a share of GDP, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
manufacturing sector has been stagnant in recent years, and it has lost international market share; lastly,&#13;
the weak business environmentis a key constraint for the manufacturing sector. Obstacles to doing business&#13;
aï¬&#128;ect this sector more than many others because manufacturing needs access to capital for investments,&#13;
infrastructure to import inputs and export and distribute ï¬&#129;nished products, aï¬&#128;ordable and reliable&#13;
electricity to produce, labor to man operations, and fair and streamlined regulations and trade policies that&#13;
allow ï¬&#129;rms to compete.&#13;

            This is the eleventh edition of the
            Kenya Economic Update. The special focus of this update
            examines the structural factors underpinning the poor
            performance of the manufacturing sector. Drawing on recent
            firm-level data from the 2010 Industrial Census and the 2013
            Enterprise Survey. It investigates the extent to which the
            sector's lack of dynamism reflects problems in
            Kenya's business environment, which compares poorly to
            regional neighbors' on several manufacturing-relevant
            dimensions. The report has four main messages: First, Kenya
            begins 2015 in a sound economic position. After growing an
            estimated 5.4 percent in 2014, its economy is poised to be
            among the fastest growing in the region, with growth
            projected at 6.0 percent in 2015, 6.6 percent in 2016, and
            7.0 percent in 2017. Second, the external sector remains
            weak and vulnerable, as import growth continue to outpace
            export growth and short-term flows finance the current
            account deficit. The large deficit points to underlying
            structural weaknesses in Kenya's economy, which need to
            be addressed. Third, Kenya needs to increase the
            competitiveness of the manufacturing sector so that it can
            grow, export, and create much-needed jobs. As a share of
            GDP, Kenya's manufacturing sector has been stagnant in
            recent years, and it has lost international market share;
            lastly, the weak business environmentis a key constraint for
            the manufacturing sector. Obstacles to doing business affect
            this sector more than many others because manufacturing
            needs access to capital for investments, infrastructure to
            import inputs and export and distribute finished products,
            affordable and reliable electricity to produce, labor to man
            operations, and fair and streamlined regulations and trade
            policies that allow firms to compete.
