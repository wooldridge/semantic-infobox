REPUBLIC OF IRAQ&#13;
EMERGENCY BAGHDAD WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
A. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Large oil reserves and abundant natural and human resources enabled Iraq to&#13;
attain the status of a middle-income country in the 1970s. Income per capita rose to over&#13;
US$3,600 in the early 1980s. Today, Iraq's human development indicators are now&#13;
among the lowest in the region. Per capita income dropped to about US$770-1,020 by&#13;
2001. Although there is a scarcity of reliable economic data, the gross domestic product&#13;
(GDP) for 2003 is estimated at about US$13-17 billion, or about US$480-630 per person.&#13;
2.    Since the mid-1980s, years of conflicts, misdirected resources, and the affects of&#13;
Iraq's centralized command economy have stifled economic growth and development,&#13;
curtailing Iraq's ability to invest in new infrastructure and maintain existing facilities.&#13;
Conflicts, looting, and sabotage have also resulted in direct damage to buildings,&#13;
pipelines, communication equipment, and transportation links. Billing systems and&#13;
associated revenues that maintain operations have collapsed. Today, most Iraqis have&#13;
limited access to essential basic services, including electricity, water supply, sanitation,&#13;
and refuse collection. Serious environmental and health risks associated with&#13;
contaminated water supplies, inappropriate handling of solid waste, and disposal of&#13;
sewage threaten to further burden the already stressed health system. The concentration&#13;
of economic and social activities in the main urban centers of Iraq has also led to a&#13;
proliferation of under-serviced neighborhoods in major Iraqi cities. The lack of basic&#13;
infrastructure services, particularly electricity, has contributed to the general lack of&#13;
security in various parts of the country.&#13;
THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE&#13;
3.    Following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the international community was quick to&#13;
recognize the need for a multilateral approach to the reconstruction and development of&#13;
Iraq. At the request of the international community, the World Bank and the United&#13;
Nations Development Group (UNDG) worked closely together to produce an assessment&#13;
of Iraq's reconstruction needs. The United Nations (UN)/ World Bank Joint Iraq Needs&#13;
Assessment (October 2003) estimated total needs for the period 2004-2007 to be US$55&#13;
billion, comprising US$35.8 billion for the fourteen sectors covered by the Needs&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project          Technical Annex&#13;
Assessment,' and US$19.4 billion estimated by the then Coalition Provisional Authority&#13;
(CPA) for other sectors including security and oil. The Joint Needs Assessment served as&#13;
a basis for an international donors' conference held in Madrid in October of 2003, where&#13;
donors pledged about US$32 billion for the period 2004-2007.&#13;
4.     To ensure swift, flexible, and coordinated donor financing for priority investments&#13;
identified in the Needs Assessment, the World Bank and the UN designed an&#13;
International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, consisting of two trust funds-a&#13;
World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) and a UNDG Iraq Trust Fund-with mechanisms for&#13;
close coordination. About US$1 billion have been pledged for the UN and the World&#13;
Bank Trust Funds for 2004/2005. Projects presented for funding under the Trusts Funds&#13;
are submitted for approval to the Iraqi Strategic Review Board (ISRB), chaired by the&#13;
Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation, to ensure that projects are in-line&#13;
with country priorities, and that no duplication occurs.&#13;
5.     Most of the US$32 billion pledged for Iraq's reconstruction will be channeled&#13;
bilaterally. The United States (US) is the single largest contributor to Iraq's&#13;
reconstruction and to infrastructure rehabilitation in particular, with an approximate&#13;
supplemental budget of US$18.4 billion approved by US Congress in late 2003, out of&#13;
which nearly US$8 billion allocated for reconstruction activities. The US has already&#13;
awarded several major contracts for physical and social infrastructure rehabilitation.&#13;
However, Iraq still faces a large gap in financing for emergency reconstruction and&#13;
capacity building. Inadequate infrastructure service delivery remains a critical problem&#13;
that lowers the quality of life in Iraq, contributes to poor security, and thwarts economic&#13;
recovery and development.&#13;
6.     The UN, which has experience working in Iraq under the Oil-For-Food program,&#13;
is also expected to play an important role in addressing infrastructure needs. It currently&#13;
has 23 agencies working in Iraq with local staff, and, like the World Bank, has&#13;
established an operational presence in Amman for international staff. The UN and the&#13;
World Bank sectors of intervention may overlap, making it essential that respective&#13;
project teams work closely together to ensure that each institution capitalizes on its&#13;
comparative advantages and to avoid duplication of works.&#13;
The sectors are: education; health; employment creation; water and. sanitation; transport and&#13;
telecommunications; electricity; housing and land management; urban management; agriculture, water&#13;
resources, and food security; finance; state-owned industries; investment climate; mine action; and&#13;
government institutions. The cross-cutting themes are: gender, environment, and human rights.&#13;

B. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
7.    In January 2004, the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors discussed an&#13;
Interim Strategy Note of the World Bank Group for Iraq and authorized the Bank to act&#13;
as administrator of the ITF.&#13;
8.    This project is fully consistent with the Interim Strategv Note, which emphasizes&#13;
the need for rapid rehabilitation of critical infrastructure and services, short-term&#13;
employment generation, and institutional capacity building as prerequisites for long-term&#13;
sustainable recovery.&#13;
9.    There are important reasons for the Bank to be involved at this stage in&#13;
rehabilitating Iraq's infrastructure:&#13;
* Bank financing can complement ongoing large-scale infrastructure investments.&#13;
Despite relatively large amounts of financing for infrastructure from bilateral&#13;
donors, there remains a huge financing gap for infrastructure rehabilitation,&#13;
which remains one of the biggest obstacles to economic recovery. This gap has&#13;
recently increased with the decision of the US to reallocate about US$3.4 billion&#13;
towards security, of which over US$1 billion had been allocated to the Water&#13;
Supply and Sanitation sectors;&#13;
* The Bank is in a position to share international experiences and best practices&#13;
based on the Bank's considerable international experience with infrastructure&#13;
reconstruction projects in conflict-affected areas (including Bosnia-Herzegovina,&#13;
Ethiopia, West Bank and Gaza, and Afghanistan);&#13;
* Bank financing, unlike the financing of many other donors, will be implemented&#13;
by Iraqi institutions (ministries and agencies), which will ensure Iraqi ownership&#13;
and build Iraq's institutional capacity, both crucial for the country's sustainable&#13;
development; and&#13;
* The Bank will couple financing for rehabilitation with policy advice, assisting the&#13;
Government with urgent policy decisions, while laying the ground for sector&#13;
restructuring, essential for long-term sustainability of infrastructure investments.&#13;
APPLYING LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
10.   The Bank's increased role in post-conflict reconstruction over the past decade has&#13;
provided a wealth of experience on which to draw. Now guided by the World Bank's&#13;
Operational Policy (OP) 2.30, Development Cooperation and Conflict, the Bank's&#13;
reconstruction efforts put a premium on early but selective engagement, flexibility in&#13;
design and implementation, capacity building, coordination with donors and other&#13;
partners, and close monitoring and evaluation. Notwithstanding the broadening into&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project      Technical Annex&#13;
multi-sectoral assistance, World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) has&#13;
recognized the Bank's continued comparative advantage in rebuilding physical&#13;
infrastructure&#13;
11.   On the question of working in insecure environments, OP2.30 recognizes that&#13;
even in countries in conflict the Bank should "continue efforts at poverty reduction and&#13;
maintenance of socioeconomic assets" and in developing a program for a country in&#13;
transition from conflict may become involved incrementally. The Bank's recent&#13;
experience in Afghanistan provides the clearest precedent where selective assistance was&#13;
mobilized ahead of, and in support of, a fully-developed transitional support strategy.&#13;
12.   In line with these lessons, the project will be kept flexible to permit a quick&#13;
response to changing circumstances. In addition, the Bank has conducted generic&#13;
training, including project management, procurement, financial management, and&#13;
environmental and social safeguards, for staff members of ministries associated with&#13;
infrastructure. Further capacity building will take place in the coming months to ensure&#13;
client readiness in project implementation. Early and effective collaboration with other&#13;
donor agencies has also proven vital in previous emergency operations, such as&#13;
Afghanistan. Accordingly, the project team is in close contact with other external&#13;
partners, including the UN, US, European Union, United Kingdom, and Japan. The&#13;
project team has had several face-to-face meetings with representatives of line ministries&#13;
as well as the Mayoralty of Baghdad (MOB), and maintains regular discussions through&#13;
videoconferences.&#13;
WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR IN BAGHDAD&#13;
13.   Prior to the 1991 Gulf War, the water supply system in Baghdad was operating&#13;
efficiently. Safe potable water was accessible to over 90% of the population in Baghdad&#13;
with an average water supply of 330 liters per capita per day (l/c/d). During the 1990-&#13;
2000 periods, water supply in Baghdad suffered from defects due to international&#13;
sanctions that prevented the importation of spare parts and chemicals. The situation&#13;
further deteriorated as a result of the 2003 war due partly to direct damage, looting, lack&#13;
of maintenance and power outages. These factors have led to a reduction in the&#13;
effectiveness of the water treatment and supply systems with water supplies actually&#13;
reaching consumers estimated at 30% of 1990 levels.&#13;
14.   The main water source for Baghdad is the Tigris River. Water is supplied by&#13;
direct pumping from different points. Currently, the average water supply into the&#13;
Mayoralty of Baghdad is 2.15 million m3/day, whereas the average demand is 3.3 million&#13;
m3/day. Eight water treatment plants serve Baghdad with a current production capacity of&#13;
2.15 million m3/day compared to a total design capacity of 2.55 million m /day. In&#13;
addition there are some 52 compact water treatment units supplied either directly from&#13;
the River Tigris or from raw water pumping systems that are used primarily for irrigation&#13;
purposes.&#13;

4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project      Technical Annex&#13;
15.   The treatment plants are old, in need of rehabilitation, and are unable to meet the&#13;
increased demand for water. The shortages of water have led to numerous uncontrolled&#13;
and illicit connections into the networks in order to secure supplies. As a result, the&#13;
pressure in the water networks is low and water cannot reach the elevated water tanks in&#13;
residential houses. This has also exposed the networks to contamination from damaged&#13;
sewers, polluted ground, and stagnant sewage. Approximately 40% of the water&#13;
distribution network in the city urgently need to be rehabilitated to reduce distribution&#13;
losses (estimated at 50-60%). In addition, improvements are needed to ensure the&#13;
network remains pressurized and thus improve the quality of the water delivered to&#13;
consumers. This is a substantial undertaking, as Baghdad's primary and secondary&#13;
distribution network consists of 12,500 km of pipe with diameters ranging from 90 mm to&#13;
2,300 mm.     The network consists of ductile iron, steel, asbestos cement,&#13;
polyvinylchloride (PVC) and cast iron pipe. Some of the cast iron pipes are over 40 years&#13;
old and have suffered from deterioration due to the aggressive ground conditions and lack&#13;
of maintenance. All in all, currently about 25% of Baghdad's population, approximately&#13;
1.5 million inhabitants, are still unconnected to the water network.&#13;
16.   Approximately 30% of Baghdad's population is not connected to a sewage&#13;
collection and treatment system. The sanitation system in Baghdad is becoming a serious&#13;
environmental and health concern. According to available reports, sewage treatment&#13;
plants are operating at 50% of the installed capacity, and untreated sewage is being&#13;
discharged into rivers and waterways. This problem is exacerbated by the illegal&#13;
discharge of septic sewage collected from houses into rivers or onto land. Leakage from&#13;
sewer pipes is also contaminating both the potable water networks and the underground&#13;
water, which is further adding to the health and environmental problems.&#13;
17.   Baghdad's three sewage treatment plants combined comprise 75% of the nation's&#13;
sewage treatment capacity. Due to sanctions, war and looting incidents after the war, the&#13;
plants' performance efficiencies have dropped by 30-50%. In addition, power cuts are&#13;
frequent and the standby generators need continuous repairs. The three plants, therefore,&#13;
are not operating effectively allowing the wastewater to flow directly into the River&#13;
Tigris. It is estimated that more than 1.2 million people in Baghdad alone currently have&#13;
no access to sanitation, and according to CARE International, the US-based charity,&#13;
300,000 metric tons of raw sewage escape into the Tigris River daily.&#13;
18.   The City of Baghdad and its suburbs have an area of approximately 950 km2 that&#13;
are administered by the MOB. The City of Baghdad itself is divided into nine&#13;
municipalities (See Annex 4 -MOB Organizational Structure). Each municipality is&#13;
responsible for the municipal services under its jurisdiction such as water, sanitation and&#13;
solid waste collection. The water and sanitation services are administered centrally by the&#13;
Baghdad Water Authority (BWA) and the Baghdad Sewerage Authority (BSA),&#13;
respectively. The BWA is responsible for the main water intakes, treatment plants,&#13;
transmission lines, storage reservoirs and water distribution networks. The BSA is&#13;
responsible for the main sewers, sewage treatment plants and sewage disposal. Both&#13;
Authorities have departments for administration, finance, procurement, operation and&#13;
maintenance etc.&#13;

Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project      Technical Annex&#13;
19.   The Municipalities' role is limited to installing house connections and pipelines&#13;
with diameter less than 250mm. The planning and implementation of projects related to&#13;
each municipality is the responsibility of the Mayoralty of Baghdad. This includes project&#13;
planning, funding, agreements with donors, design and execution. Funds from&#13;
international donors are coordinated with the Ministry of Planning and Development&#13;
Cooperation.&#13;
20.   Existing consumer tariffs are extremely low and barely cover the cost of water&#13;
and operation &amp; maintenance costs. Current prices of water do not reflect international&#13;
market or true production costs. Considering the current difficult security situation and&#13;
the prevailing unreliable water services, it is not expected that cost-reflective tariffs will&#13;
be introduced immediately.&#13;
C. THE PROJECT&#13;
21.   This project represents the first phase of the Emergency Infrastructure&#13;
Reconstruction Program, described in the Project Information Document (PID) of April&#13;
21, 2004, which intended to cover five sectors: water supply and sanitation, electricity,&#13;
urban rehabilitation, transport, and telecommunications. In view of the limited&#13;
availability of funds in the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund, and the expressed interest of&#13;
donors for certain sectors, the project will focus on the urgent water supply and sanitation&#13;
rehabilitation needs of the capital city of Baghdad. Given the MOB's independent status,&#13;
its historical responsibility for most infrastructure services within its boundary, and the&#13;
severity of the physical and environmental damages to its facilities during the last&#13;
conflict, a similar project is also proposed for other urban areas outside Baghdad.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
22.   The principal objective of the project is to assist in restoring basic water supply&#13;
and sanitation services for the capital city of Baghdad through (a) the reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation of existing priority networks and treatment facilities and (b) providing&#13;
capacity building support through training and technical assistance. The project will&#13;
complement support by other donors. The project will also create vitally needed short-&#13;
term employment and help build Iraq's capacity to manage large-scale reconstruction.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
23.   The project addresses the urgent reconstruction needs of Baghdad including water&#13;
mains, distribution pipes, sewer collectors, pumping stations, small treatment plants, and&#13;
auxiliary facilities. It provides support to the MOB to better manage projects at the&#13;
design, supervision, operation and maintenance stages by building the capacity of the&#13;
staff working in the water supply and sanitation sector. It also includes the development&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project       Technical Annex&#13;
of a Comprehensive City Development Plan (CCDP) to ensure that future expansion of&#13;
the water supply and sanitation networks are in line with the overall urban development&#13;
plan for the city. Project components and their estimated costs3 are summarized below&#13;
and further detailed in Annex 3.&#13;
&gt; Component 1 - Rehabilitation of chlorine and chemical units at Al-Karkh&#13;
Water Treatment Plant. (Estimated cost of US$2.8 million)&#13;
24.   Al-Karkh Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was constructed in 1985 and is one of&#13;
the largest treatment plants in the world with a total capacity of 1,365 million liters per&#13;
day (MLD). The source of raw water is the River Tigris and water treated by the plant&#13;
supplies 65% of the total water demand of Baghdad. Unavailability of spare parts,&#13;
damaged equipment and chlorine leakages, over the last 14 years have affected the plant&#13;
efficiency. This component will serve to both improve the reliability and efficiency of&#13;
the chlorination and chemical processes and increase safety by installing new automatic&#13;
chlorinators and by rehabilitating the ventilation system.&#13;
&gt; Component 2 - Rehabilitation of 2B pumping station in Shark Dijla Water&#13;
Treatment Plant. (Estimated cost of US$4.5 million)&#13;
25.   Baghdad is located on the two sides of the Tigris River. It receives its potable&#13;
water from two principal WTP, namely Al-Karkh WTP (mentioned above) on the west&#13;
side (Karkh district), and the Shark Dijla WTP (540 MLD), on the east side (Rasafa&#13;
District). In 1989, a 820 MLD blending station, referred to as the 2B pumping station,&#13;
was added to the Shark Dijla WTP to receive potable water from Al Karkh WTP and&#13;
pump it to the Rasafa district. This pumping station has not been renovated since the 90s&#13;
and is in dire need of repair. This component will address rehabilitation of the 2B&#13;
pumping station at the Shark Dijla WTP.&#13;
&gt; Component 3 - Extension and rehabilitation of Al-Rasheed WTP. (Estimated&#13;
cost of US$7.2 million)&#13;
26.   This is an old WTP with a design capacity of 68 MLD, which was designed to&#13;
supply potable water to the Za'afarania suburb (350,000 inhabitants). It is currently in&#13;
poor shape and unable to meet the current demand of the community. This component&#13;
covers the expansion, rehabilitation and upgrading of the plant to treat the highly polluted&#13;
raw water of the Tigris water at this location. It also covers rehabilitation and&#13;
strengthening of the water mains, storage tanks, pumping stations and chlorinators.&#13;
3The estimated total costs for components I through 6 exclude physical and price contingencies (estimated&#13;
at 11%), as well as design and training costs (the latter being accounted for in component 7).&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project      Technical Annex&#13;
&gt; Component 4 - Rehabilitation of the Abu Nuwas Raw Water Pumping&#13;
Station. (Estimated cost of US$6.2 million)&#13;
27.   This pumping station was destroyed completely and vandalized in the latest&#13;
conflict. The Abu Nuwas pumping station contains four vertical pumps of a 3,600 m3/hr&#13;
capacity and two vertical pumps of a 1,800 m3/hr capacity together with all related works.&#13;
Currently, only two pumps of 3600 m3/hr are operational; the proposed component will&#13;
completely rehabilitate the electrical and mechanical equipment in the station to increase&#13;
the pumping capacity to 18,000 m3 /hr.&#13;
&gt; Component 5 - Rehabilitation and renewal of Sadr City Sewerage Network.&#13;
(Estimated cost of US$15.0 million)&#13;
28.   Sadr City comprises 80 districts with a population of about 2 million inhabitants.&#13;
Currently the city experiences frequent back-ups of sewage to streets and adjacent&#13;
neighborhoods. This is due largely to broken pipes, lack of maintenance and inadequate&#13;
rehabilitation. This component will provide rehabilitation of secondary sewers ranging in&#13;
size between 200-400mm sewer pipes in part of Sadr City and it surrounding areas,&#13;
including the addition of house connections, serving approximately 200,000 inhabitants.&#13;
Sewage would flow through the existing trunk mains to the Rustumiya Wastewater&#13;
Treatment Plant.&#13;
&gt; Component 6 - Rehabilitation and renewal of Drinking Water Network in&#13;
Za'afarania. (Estimated cost of US$15.4 million)&#13;
29.   Za'afarania is one of the poorest districts in the Karrada Municipality of Baghdad&#13;
Govemorate. The area has a population of approximately 350,000 whose current source&#13;
of water are water tankers of uncontrolled quality. Expenditure on water typically&#13;
comprises 20% of the average family's monthly income. This component includes the&#13;
supply and installation of water pipes of varying diameters to provide adequate water&#13;
supplies for domestic and commercial use. This component will also improve the&#13;
economic conditions of the population by reducing the purchase of water from&#13;
unregulated tankers, and contribute to the reduction in the incidence of water borne&#13;
diseases by providing safe potable water.&#13;
&gt; Component 7 - Technical Assistance and Capacity Building. (Estimated total&#13;
of US$3.9 million)&#13;
30.   This component is essential to ensure the proper implementation of the project&#13;
and to train MOB staff on efficient utility practices and financing. It will include the&#13;
following activities:&#13;
* Consulting services to complete final designs and tender documents;&#13;
* Consulting services for construction and implementation supervision;&#13;
.  Capacity building and training in specific technical, environmental and&#13;
social and commercial areas;&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project       Technical Annex&#13;
. Design   and  implementation  of appropriate  accounting, financial&#13;
management, information, billing and collection, and related systems;&#13;
* Consulting services to asses demand characteristics, cost of supply, demand&#13;
management and tariff structures;&#13;
* Audits;&#13;
* Individual consultants to support the Project Management Team (PMT);&#13;
* Office equipment, vehicles, furniture and operation costs for the Project;&#13;
and,&#13;
* Feasibility studies and final designs for follow-up projects.&#13;
Component 8 - Development of a Comprehensive City Development Plan for&#13;
Baghdad (CCDP). (Estimated cost of US$3.0 million)&#13;
31.   Around 23% of Iraq's total population lives in the capital Baghdad, where the&#13;
population is estimated to be 6 million. The city has experienced intense urbanization due&#13;
to years of economic sanctions where key economic and social activities became&#13;
concentrated in the capital. Baghdad has been developing in the absence of effective&#13;
planning and has grown well beyond its planned limits. Spontaneous informal settlements&#13;
became established in and around the city. The latest attempt at formulating a&#13;
Comprehensive City Development Plan (CCDP) for Baghdad was carried-out during the&#13;
late eighties. The process was highly centralized and failed to adequately incorporate&#13;
social, economic and environmental considerations. A CCDP is proposed to carry the&#13;
vision for the future of Baghdad for the year 2030. The CCDP will focus on analyzing the&#13;
existing conditions and discussing future trends related to land-use patterns, physical&#13;
expansion, housing, population, cultural heritage and other economic, environmental and&#13;
social infrastructure.&#13;
PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
32.   A Grant of US$65 million is proposed to cover the costs of this project. The MOB&#13;
has agreed to cover the salaries of the PMT staff, estimated at US$450,000. Project&#13;
details are provided in Annex 3.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS / PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
33.   The institutional arrangements for the project works within the organization&#13;
structures of the Iraqi Ministries. The MOB will be the implementing agency and the&#13;
direct recipient of the Grant. A few other Iraqi institutions, such as the Ministry of the&#13;
Environment, would be associated indirectly with the project for clearances and reviews&#13;
in accordance with national requirements. The organizational structure of MOB is&#13;
provided in Annex 4.&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project     Technical Annex&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
34.   The project will be implemented by the MOB, through a Project Management&#13;
Team (PMT) reporting directly to the Mayor, with experienced staff seconded on a full-&#13;
time basis from existing technical and financial units. The PMT will closely coordinate&#13;
its daily activities with the different departments of the MOB, particularly with Baghdad&#13;
Water and Sewerage Authorities (Annex 4). The PMT will include, but not be limited to:&#13;
a director, two procurement specialists, two project engineers, one urban specialist, one&#13;
financial management specialist, one environmental safeguard specialist, one&#13;
administrative assistant, one quality assurance staff and one legal advisor. The MOB has&#13;
also agreed to use the services of local and international/regional consultants to assist&#13;
with final designs, tender documents, tendering, financial management and supervision of&#13;
works. On-the-job training will also be provided by the consultants. MOB staff have&#13;
attended initial training courses and workshops organized by the World Bank, UN&#13;
agencies and some bilateral donors. Finally, the capacity building component provides&#13;
financing for additional professional training locally or with international institutes.&#13;
35.   International and local consultants were recruited by the World Bank to assist the&#13;
MOB in completing the project briefs and in carrying-out initial analysis and due&#13;
diligence on all the proposed components. Where possible, components have been&#13;
separated into small size packages to allow for local contractors' participation in the&#13;
reconstruction efforts. Nevertheless, some components have been grouped into large&#13;
sector contracts for equipment supply to simplify implementation and permit direct&#13;
disbursement of funds. The preferred method of disbursing funds is direct payment by the&#13;
World Bank to suppliers upon the instruction of the PMT and in accordance with the&#13;
contract between the MOB and the supplier.&#13;
36.   The Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation (MOPDC) and the&#13;
ISRB, have reviewed and cleared all components submitted by the MOB. In line with the&#13;
requirements of the Iraq Trust Fund, a Monitoring Agent will be recruited to ensure&#13;
adherence to the overall requirements of the Trust Fund.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
37.   Procurement for this Project will be carried out in accordance with the World&#13;
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004;&#13;
and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"&#13;
dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Grant Agreement. Also,&#13;
procurement will be undertaken in conformit-y with the Master Implementation Manual&#13;
(MIM), due for completion in January 2005. Detailed description of the procurement&#13;
methods or consultant selection methods are specified in the Procurement Plan (PP)&#13;
(Annex 7). The PP will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual&#13;
project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
38.   Procurement of Works and Goods: For International Competitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
of Works and Goods, the standard bidding documents (SBD) of the Bank will be used.&#13;
These will be: Procurement of Works, Procurement of Smaller Works, Supply and&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project     Technical Annex&#13;
Installation of Equipment (to be used for the construction and installation of water&#13;
treatment plants and facilities, with appropriate modifications) and Procurement of&#13;
Goods. For procurement under National Competitive Bidding (NCB), a modified&#13;
standard bidding document, in Arabic, acceptable to the Bank will be used. Smaller&#13;
works will be procured following the procedures of procurement of minor works on the&#13;
basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a&#13;
written invitation.&#13;
39.   Selection of Consultants: Consultants' services procured under this project will&#13;
include: selection of consultants to provide engineering services such as finalization of&#13;
the detailed design and preparation of tender documents of the projects that will be&#13;
financed by the proposed Grant; selection of consultant to carryout feasibility studies to&#13;
prepare a follow-up project; selection of consultant to prepare a comprehensive city&#13;
development plan for the area of the Mayoralty of Baghdad, selection of a specialized&#13;
firm and individuals to assist the PMT in project implementation in the areas of: training&#13;
of MOB staff in procurement, financial management, project management and other&#13;
technical fields as needed. Shortlists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in&#13;
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
Assessment of MOB capacity with procurement&#13;
40.   Based on existing information on the overall environment for procurement in Iraq&#13;
and in particular within the Mayoralty of Baghdad, the overall procurement risk&#13;
assessment is judged to be high.&#13;
41.   There is no specialized procurement department in the current organizational&#13;
structure of the MOB. Whereas, international procurement is carried out by the Economic&#13;
and Commercial office within the MOB, local procurement that mainly caters for the&#13;
need of MOB, is carried out by each department of the MOB through a specialized unit.&#13;
International and local procurement are closely coordinated with the Department of&#13;
Administrative Affairs.&#13;
42.   Procurement activities under the project will be carried out by a PMT under the&#13;
direct supervision of the Mayor. It is critical that at least one qualified procurement staff&#13;
member be selected prior to the Grant signing. He or she will be trained on and become&#13;
well-versed in Bank procurement procedures within the first three months after Grant&#13;
signing.&#13;
43.   There are several issues and risk factors associated with the procurement process&#13;
within project implementation. These include: (i) the volatile security conditions in Iraq,&#13;
(ii) the lack of adequate laws, regulations and modem standard documentation due to&#13;
inadequate procurement procedures inherited from the former regime which will take&#13;
time to change, (iii) the lack of expertise in using Bank procurement guidelines and&#13;
international sound procurement practices, (iv) the current inability of Bank procurement&#13;
staff to supervise the project in the field, (v) delays in implementing the procurement plan&#13;
due to limited experience in planning, preparation of terms of reference, preparation of&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project     Technical Annex&#13;
tender documents in English, and, technical and financial evaluation of bids, (vi) the&#13;
potential language barrier for the staff who have to deal in detail with procurement in&#13;
English, and, (vii) the lack of law enforcement which would increase the risk of looting&#13;
and the damaging of facilities.&#13;
44.   Risk mitigation measures include: (i) enhancement of MOB procurement capacity&#13;
by training of the PMT procurement staff in structured training courses that are offered&#13;
by international training institutes (ii) allocation of Grant funds for the strengthening of&#13;
the capacity of the MOB to manage and implement the project in an effective and&#13;
transparent way, (iii) the recruitment of a specialized international firm to assist the PMT&#13;
on procurement and project management issues, and, (iv) organization of series of&#13;
workshops on different areas of procurement and project management for MOB staff&#13;
throughout project implementation.&#13;
45.   Packaging of supply and installation contracts are flagged as a potential risk.&#13;
These contracts are planned to be procured following ICB procedures. However, if the&#13;
prevailing security conditions at the time of bidding continue to be an issue, potential&#13;
qualified bidders may not be in a position to submit bids. This can be mitigated by re-&#13;
packaging these projects into two separate "Supply of Goods" and "Works" contracts&#13;
where the former could be procured under ICB and the latter following NCB procedures.&#13;
DISBURSEMENT&#13;
46.   The proposed grant of US$65 million is expected to be fully disbursed by&#13;
December 31, 2007. The allocation of the grant proceeds according to each expenditure&#13;
category and the quarterly disbursement amounts are outlined in Annex 2.&#13;
47.   The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen&#13;
institutional capacity by financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries&#13;
and other recipient entities. Trained PMTs will facilitate implementation and help ensure&#13;
compliance with fiduciary and other safeguards. PMTs will be employed and paid by the&#13;
implementing entity at regular salary levels, thereby avoiding the disadvantages of stand-&#13;
alone Project Implementation Units that can erode civil servants institutional capacity&#13;
over the medium and long term. The project will finance specialized technical support in&#13;
procurement, financial management, and other areas as needed. In addition, to ensure that&#13;
project funds are used for the purposes intended and to help carry out project supervision,&#13;
the Bank will employ two independent firms as Fiduciary and Safeguards Monitoring&#13;
Agents.&#13;
48.   As a further compensating control, disbursements will be made primarily by&#13;
direct payment by the Bank to the contractors, consultants, and vendors. Once authorized&#13;
by the MOB, direct payments will be made by the World Bank directly into the account&#13;
of the contractor, consultant, or vendor in a commercial bank capable of receiving funds&#13;
transferred from the international banking system.&#13;
49.   The project management component and payments below the threshold of&#13;
US$10,000 normally will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project     Technical Annex&#13;
resources. These payments made from the Recipient's own resources will be reimbursed,&#13;
on a periodic basis, by the Bank to the MOB upon presentation of relevant supporting&#13;
documents, proof of payment and a signed withdrawal application. The PMT and the&#13;
main financial counterparts from the MOB will be subject to intensive training in the&#13;
Bank's disbursement procedures.&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
50.   Bank policies require that grant proceeds be used only for the purposes for which&#13;
they were granted, with due regard to economy, efficiency, and the sustainable&#13;
achievement of the project's development objectives. The Recipient (MOB), is requested&#13;
in this regard, to cause the PMT to maintain an appropriate and adequate financial&#13;
management system, including records and accounts, and to prepare financial statements&#13;
that adequately reflect project operations, resources, and expenditures. The Grant&#13;
Agreement also commits the recipient to have the accounts, records, and financial&#13;
statements of the grant audited each fiscal year by a qualified auditor acceptable to the&#13;
Administrator (Bank) following internationally accepted standards.&#13;
51.   Financial Management Risk Assessment The financial management risk&#13;
associated with this operation is considered as high. Critical risk factors are: (i) ongoing&#13;
insecurity, which prevents onsite Bank supervision and assessments, including financial&#13;
management assessments; (ii) the Bank's limited knowledge of Iraq's public financial&#13;
management systems, controls, and procedures; (iii) the limited knowledge on the part of&#13;
Iraqi authorities of the Bank policies and procedures; (iv) the possibility of MOB not&#13;
making available the necessary financial resources to honor payments below the value of&#13;
US$ 10,000; (v) difficult communication and flow of information between worksites and&#13;
the PMT, which could delay payments; (vi) inefficiencies in Iraq's banking system that&#13;
may delay payments and transfer of funds to contractors, suppliers, or the MOB; (vii)&#13;
variation orders that may exceed price contingencies and difficulty may be encountered&#13;
in verifying justification for variation orders. Although the project design mitigates to the&#13;
extent possible these risks, the project will require close monitoring and supervision&#13;
during implementation. A detailed risk assessment is in Annex 9.&#13;
52.   The control risks will be partially mitigated by putting in place additional controls&#13;
and procedures including: (a) the PMT will verify and authorize payments under the&#13;
project and verify justification for variation orders; (b) the PMT will be assigned&#13;
competent financial staff from the MOB finance department who will be led by a&#13;
financial management consultant, (c) the Mayor will assign an internal auditor from the&#13;
internal audit department to perform ex-ante verification on all project financial&#13;
transactions, (d) disbursements by the Bank will be made primarily by direct payment or&#13;
reimbursement supported by full documentation, and (e) the Fiduciary Monitoring Agent&#13;
will review all project expenditures.&#13;
53.   The accounting and reporting risks will be managed by putting in place a simple&#13;
computerized accounting system using a spreadsheet application that is capable of&#13;
recording all project expenditures, tracking project commitments in real time during the&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project      Technical Annex&#13;
implementation period, and providing the data needed to generate project reports,&#13;
including the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs).&#13;
54.   An external independent auditor with international experience will be appointed&#13;
to perform the project audits and issue an independent opinion on the project financial&#13;
statements. This external audit report will encompass all project activities and will be&#13;
presented in accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards. The audit report&#13;
along with the related financial statements should be submitted to the Bank not later than&#13;
six months after the end of each project fiscal year.&#13;
55.   All the above activities and procedures will be documented in a chapter of the&#13;
project implementation plan and are in line with the Master Implementation Manual.&#13;
Details of project financial management arrangements and identified risks is in Annex 9.&#13;
56.   Reporting To Donors. The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger&#13;
accounts in respect of the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF.&#13;
Within ninety (90) days of the end of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30,&#13;
and December 31), the Bank will prepare, on a cash basis, an unaudited statements of&#13;
receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to&#13;
each donor. Each such statement will be expressed in United States Dollars, the currency&#13;
in which the ITF funds will be maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one hundred&#13;
and eighty (180) days of the completion of all disbursements relating to activities&#13;
financed from the ITF, the Bank will prepare on a cash basis an unaudited financial&#13;
statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and&#13;
forward a copy to each donor.&#13;
57.   The Bank will furnish to the donors:&#13;
a.    on a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of&#13;
the ITF (including contributions, disbursements, and implementation progress) in&#13;
the preceding six months; and&#13;
b.    on an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation&#13;
from the Bank's external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal control&#13;
over cash-based financial reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS&#13;
58.   The project will be limited to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing&#13;
damaged facilities, and as such, it is rated as a category "B" project. Based on section 13&#13;
of OP 4.01, exemption has been sought from the World Bank's executive management&#13;
(March 2004) in order that any Environmental Assessment requirements will not be&#13;
conducted prior to project appraisal. Instead, all subprojects will be processed in&#13;
accordance with the Environmental and Social Screening Assessment Framework&#13;
(ESSAF) for Iraq, which was disclosed by the MOB in October 2004. In addition, a&#13;
waiver/exceptions to the notification requirements under paragraph 7(a) of the policy OP&#13;
7.50 has been sought and cleared on November 15, 2004. The ESSAF entails that: (a) all&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project     Technical Annex&#13;
subprojects be screened by the MOB through a checklist attached in the ESSAF; (b) that&#13;
a code of practice be included as part of civil work contracts as well as of purchase and&#13;
installation of equipment contracts; (c) that an EMP will be undertaken during project&#13;
implementation for the Rustumiyah Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) which falls&#13;
within the zone of influence of the project as per OP 4.01; and (d) that capacity building&#13;
is undertaken on the environmental issues and on corrective environmental measures in&#13;
order to enable the MOB, and the Ministry of Environment, to address any potential&#13;
aspects that may arise during the screening and implementation of the components. The&#13;
World Bank team and the Recipient will be taking the necessary measures to ensure&#13;
compliance with the ESSAF and due diligence for the Rustumiyah WWTP.&#13;
59.   It is anticipated that land acquisition and resettlement will be kept to a minimum&#13;
and all land acquisition and resettlement will be carried out in accordance with these&#13;
guidelines set forth in the ESSAF. Subproject proposals that would require demolishing&#13;
houses or acquiring productive land will be carefully reviewed to minimize or avoid their&#13;
impacts through alternative alignments. Proposals that require more than minor&#13;
expansion along rights of way will be reviewed carefully. No land or asset acquisition&#13;
may take place outside of the ESSAF guidelines. A format for Land Acquisition&#13;
Assessment Data Sheet has also been prepared and is part of the ESSAF (Annex 10).&#13;
PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
60.   Considering the unfamiliarity of the Iraqi counterparts with Bank guidelines and&#13;
procedures, strong supervision efforts including frequent field visits would be needed,&#13;
particularly during the early stages of project implementation. Should the security&#13;
situation prevent Bank staff and international consultants from traveling to Iraq during&#13;
project implementation, project supervision would primarily rely on local Iraqi&#13;
consultants and UN partners in Iraq, supported by Bank staff and international&#13;
consultants working from outside Iraq. Regional consultants with branch offices in&#13;
Baghdad could also be recruited to assist with project implementation.&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
61.   Performance indicators for the project have been identified during project&#13;
appraisal and will be measured annually during supervision (Annex 11). The MOB will&#13;
work with consultant(s) to establish a monitoring baseline against which performance can&#13;
be measured. Annual reviews by the MOPDC and the MOB would be carried out to track&#13;
compliance with Grant conditions and highlight lessons from implementation. A mid-&#13;
term review is scheduled for August 2006 and a final project review is scheduled for&#13;
August 2007 to evaluate overall project accomplishments. Furthermore, an independent&#13;
Monitoring Agent will be appointed to assess compliance with the Grant Agreement, as&#13;
stipulated in the Trust Fund Conditions.&#13;

E. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATIONS&#13;
62.   The project would lead to significant health and welfare benefits. Overall, the&#13;
project is expected to: (i) produce an improvement in the quality of life of about a million&#13;
people in Baghdad through the elimination of sewerage backup in streets and homes; and,&#13;
(ii) reduce the incidence of oral-fecal diseases and the rate of mortality in children which&#13;
are most affected by water-borne diseases.&#13;
63.   The project not only provides for the rehabilitation of water and sewerage&#13;
facilities but also complements and enhances the effectiveness of other works currently&#13;
underway in Baghdad by other donors, notably the US. Importantly, the project provides&#13;
for capacity building and training the thrust of which is meant to ensure the sustainability&#13;
of the infrastructure being put in place, particularly through the design and&#13;
implementation of appropriate accounting, financial management and information and&#13;
billing and collection systems, and cost recovery measures. Given the high positive&#13;
externalities for investments of this type, the project is expected to be cost-effective. The&#13;
economic and financial benefits of this project have not been quantified at this stage, as&#13;
this is an emergency operation (as allowed under OP8.50).&#13;
F. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
64.   This project is being undertaken in a continuing -conflict environment with a high&#13;
range of risks. The table below summarizes the key risks identified, and indicates which&#13;
measures are being taken to mitigate these risks.&#13;

FROM OUTPUTS TO OBJECTIVES&#13;
Transition to a New Iraqi government -     H      Keeping project simple - involving all&#13;
unknown outcomes that could affect project        stakeholders. Downplaying any political&#13;
implementation                                    aspects of project.&#13;
Administration changes in MOB-             H      Building relationships at the technical&#13;
jeopardizing current commitment to project         level with current officials to ensure&#13;
design and inputs                                 continuity in the event of change.&#13;
Sectoral priorities - difficult to establish in  S  Ongoing communication with Bank&#13;
current political setting - possible              counterparts working with MOF and&#13;
disagreements between MOB and other               MOPDC. Involving all stakeholders&#13;
agencies (MOPDC, MOF)                             through PMT.&#13;
Deterioration of fiscal conditions -       S      Avoiding capacity expansion that is&#13;
sustainability problems for operations            likely to create budgetary constraints.&#13;
FROM COMPONENTS TO OUTPUTS&#13;
Goods could be lost or stolen from central  M     Using strict procedures for delivery of&#13;
storage facility or from project sites            goods and tight time schedules to install&#13;
goods immediately. Resort to supply and&#13;
installation contracts.&#13;
Security  conditions  deteriorate  making  H      This risk is beyond the control of MOB&#13;
project completion difficult                      or WB. Involving security and police&#13;
personnel could alleviate problems.&#13;
Difficulty  in  hiring  expatriate  TA     M      Capacity building will focus on local&#13;
Consultants wherever local expertise is           staff. Where possible support from&#13;
lacking                                           international TA  will be  provided&#13;
through virtual meetings, and meetings&#13;
in Amman. In the event that local&#13;
capacity is initially not adequate for&#13;
rapid implementation, the MOB will&#13;
resort to use of external agents for&#13;
relevant aspects of implementation and&#13;
monitoring in the early stages.&#13;
The Bank's inability to carry out in- country  S  Consultants will be contracted to assist in&#13;
supervision                                       supervision. In addition, special&#13;
monitoring instruments would be&#13;
designed for ITF-financed projects , use&#13;
of MOB implementation staff,&#13;
supervision consultants and supervision&#13;
by independent Monitoring Agents.&#13;
PROCuREMENT RISKS&#13;
The lack of good laws and regulations,     H      Many senior qualified officials of the&#13;
modern standard documentation and the             MOB received training in Amman on&#13;
habits acquired by procurement staff in the       Bank Guidelines. Continuous training to&#13;
previous era, which will take time to change      be provided on Financial Management&#13;
and related aspects.&#13;

Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project      Technical Annex&#13;
Annex 3: Project Detailed Description&#13;
Component 1 - Rehabilitation of chlorine and chemical units at Al-Karkh Water&#13;
Treatment Plant. (Estimated cost of US$2.8 million)&#13;
Al-Karkh Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was constructed in 1985 and is one of the&#13;
largest treatment plants in the world with a total capacity of 1,365 million liters per day&#13;
(MLD). The source of raw water is the River Tigris and water treated by the plant&#13;
supplies 65% of the total water demand of Baghdad. Over the last 14 years, the chemical&#13;
treatment at the WTP has depended on supplies of local alum that has a high percentage&#13;
of impurities. The use of this sub-quality chemical has resulted in severe damage to the&#13;
alum storage facilities, the alum preparation tanks, and the alum transfer pipes. This in&#13;
turn has affected the treatment efficiency of the WTP. Additionally the chlorinators,&#13;
evaporators, and various special valves have been damaged as a result of chlorine leakage&#13;
from the cylinders and it has not been possible to adequately repair this equipment due to&#13;
the unavailability of spare parts over the past 15 years. The component will serve to both&#13;
improve the reliability and efficiency of the chlorination and increase safety by installing&#13;
new automatic chlorinators and rehabilitating the ventilation system.&#13;
Specifically, this component will include the following:&#13;
*  Supply and installation of 15 km. of 1 ½/2, diameter bound steel&#13;
pipes for the alum network;&#13;
*  Supply and installation of new alum pumps;&#13;
*  Supply and installation of special chemical valves and equipment&#13;
for the alum network; and,&#13;
*  Supply and installation of new chlorinators and their accessories&#13;
Component 2 - Rehabilitation of 2B pumping station in Shark Dijla Water&#13;
Treatment Plant. (Estimated cost of US$4.5 million)&#13;
Baghdad is located on the two sides of the Tigris River. It receives its potable water from&#13;
two principal water treatment plants (WTPs), namely Al-Karkh WTP (above-mentioned)&#13;
on the west side (Karkh district), and the Shark Dijla WTP (540 MLD), on the east side&#13;
(Rasafa District). In 1989, a 820 MLD blending station, referred to as the 2B pumping&#13;
station, was added to the Shark Dijla WTP to receive potable water from Al Karkh WTP&#13;
and pump it to the Rasafa district. This pumping station has not been renovated since the&#13;
90s and is in need of dire repair.&#13;
This component will address all aspects of rehabilitation of the 2B pumping station at the&#13;
Shark Dijla WTP including:&#13;
* Supply spare parts to overhaul the main 205 MLD vertical pumps (6 Nos.);&#13;
* Supply and replacement of the defective suction and discharge valves;&#13;
* Supply and install UPS systems and batteries;&#13;
* Supply and replace three chlorinators, repair of associated equipment; and,&#13;
28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project     Technical Annex&#13;
Component 3 - Extension and Rehabilitation of Al-Rasheed WTP. (Estimated&#13;
cost of US$7.2 million)&#13;
This is an old WTP with a design capacity of 68 MLD, which was designed to supply&#13;
potable water to the Zaafarania suburb (350,000 inhabitants). It is currently in poor shape&#13;
and unable to meet the current demand of the community. This component covers the&#13;
extension, rehabilitation and upgrading of the plant to treat the highly polluted raw water&#13;
of the Tigris at this location. It also covers rehabilitation and strengthening of the water&#13;
mains, storage tanks, pumping stations and chlorinators.&#13;
* Design and construction of new water treatment stream of 22 MLD capacity;&#13;
* Design of additional new process unit to the existing WTP to treat the high&#13;
organic loads in the raw water to meet the required standards; and,&#13;
* Rehabilitation of the existing water treatment plant, including:&#13;
o Rehabilitation of water intake.&#13;
o Rehabilitation of low lift pumps&#13;
o Modification of flash mixer&#13;
o Rehabilitation of flocculation tanks&#13;
o Rehabilitation of settling tanks&#13;
o Rehabilitation of filters&#13;
o Rehabilitation of alum plant&#13;
* Design and construction of a new chemical and disinfection stations for&#13;
the existing WTP to replace the old one;&#13;
* Design and construction of a new water storage tank of 3,000 m3 capacity;&#13;
and,&#13;
* Construction of new 750m long, 1000mm diameter ductile iron delivery&#13;
main to connect to the distribution network&#13;
Component 4 - Rehabilitation of the Abu Nuwas Raw Water Pumping&#13;
Station. (Estimated cost of US$6.2 million)&#13;
This pumping station was destroyed completely and vandalized after the 2003 war. Abu&#13;
Nuwas pumping station contains four vertical pumps of 3,600 m3/hr capacity and two&#13;
vertical pumps of 1,800 m3/hr capacity together with all related works. The proposed&#13;
component will completely rehabilitate the electrical and mechanical equipment in the&#13;
station to increase the pumping capacity to 18,000 m3 /hr (currently only two pumps of&#13;
3,600 m3/hr are operational).&#13;
The reconstruction and upgrading work will include supply and installation of electrical&#13;
and mechanical equipment, control panels and utility connections to feed 16 compact&#13;
water units located at different parts of Baghdad with a total capacity of 18,000 m3 per&#13;
hour and as follows:&#13;
* Supply and install medium voltage, low voltage, and control equipment. As&#13;
per attached list&#13;
* Supply spare parts to overhaul the pumps.&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;

* Supply and install pumping station accessories such as valves, strainers, etc.&#13;
and,&#13;
* Capacity building for the operations and maintenance staff responsible for this&#13;
pumping station.&#13;
Component 5 - Rehabilitation and renewal of Sadr City Sewerage Network.&#13;
(Estimated cost of US$15 million)&#13;
The Sadr City comprises 80 districts with a population of about 2 million inhabitants.&#13;
Currently the city experiences frequent back-ups of sewage to streets and adjacent&#13;
neighborhoods. This is due largely to broken pipes, lack of maintenance and inadequate&#13;
rehabilitation. This component will provide rehabilitation of secondary sewers ranging in&#13;
size between 200-400mm sewer pipes in part of Sadr City and it surrounding areas,&#13;
including the addition of house connections, serving approximately 200,000 inhabitants.&#13;
Sewage would flow through the existing trunk mains to the Rustumiya Wastewater&#13;
Treatment Plant.&#13;
Component 6 - Rehabilitation and Renewal of Drinking Water Network with&#13;
House Connections in Za'afarania. (Estimated cost of US$15.4 million)&#13;
Al-Zaafarania is one of the poorest districts in the Karrada Municipality of Baghdad&#13;
Governorate. The area has a population of approximately 350,000 who's current source&#13;
of water are water tankers of uncontrolled quality. Expenditure on water typically&#13;
comprises 20% of the average family's monthly income. This component includes the&#13;
supply and installation of water pipes of varying diameters to provide adequate water&#13;
supplies for domestic and commercial use. This component will also improve the&#13;
economic conditions of the population by reducing the purchase of water from tankers,&#13;
and contribute to the reduction in the incidence of water borne diseases by providing safe&#13;
potable water.&#13;
This component include the following items:&#13;

Component 8 - Development of a Comprehensive City Development Plan for&#13;
Baghdad (CCDP). (Estimated cost of US$3.0 million)&#13;
Around 23% of Iraq's total population lives in the capital Baghdad (population equal to 6&#13;
million approx.). The city has experienced intense urbanization due to years of economic&#13;
sanctions where key economic and social activities became concentrated in the capital.&#13;
Baghdad has been developing in the absence of effective planning and has grown well&#13;
beyond its planned limits. Spontaneous informal settlements became established in and&#13;
around the city. Some residential zones were created next to industrial sites, with&#13;
potential risks for human health and safety. The slum areas in Baghdad are characterized&#13;
by overcrowding and acute poverty.&#13;
As mentioned above, Baghdad faces a number of complex challenges and decisions made&#13;
today will inevitably shape the city's future. The vision for the future of Baghdad is one&#13;
of a city of national and regional significance. A city that attracts and retain capital, skills&#13;
and knowledge. A city that evokes pride, and a sense of belonging with its and diverse&#13;
and inclusive quality of life. The latest attempt at formulating a Comprehensive City&#13;
Development Plan (CCDP) for Baghdad was carried-out during the late eighties. The&#13;
process was highly centralized and failed to adequately incorporate social, economic and&#13;
environmental considerations.&#13;
The proposed CCDP (US$2. 7million) will reflect the above-mentioned vision by&#13;
introducing modem urban planning tools. It will cover an area of around 900 Km2 under&#13;
Amanat Baghdad's jurisdiction. The region consists of five districts: Al-Rusafa, Al-&#13;
Karkh, Al-Adhamiya, Al-Kadhimiya, and Al-Sadr City.&#13;
The plan will guide the development of Baghdad city to the year (2030) and will&#13;
underline the future physical expansion and urbanization of the city based on sound&#13;
economic and social vision. The plan will direct the city's future growth in a planned&#13;
manner and within the national context and development strategies.&#13;
The CCDP will be achieved through a public process that produces a modem, citizen-&#13;
focused comprehensive plan for 2030. It will encourage a future for Baghdad in which&#13;
economy, equity, and environment are in balance, and in which today's needs are met&#13;
without compromising the needs of future generations. The plan will establish guidelines&#13;
for the future growth and expansion of the city and will focus on physical development of&#13;

the city by ensuring that adequate and diverse supply of land is made available to all&#13;
income levels of the society. Adequate transition between adjacent land uses and&#13;
development densities will be also introduced. The development of floodplains and/or&#13;
environmentally sensitive areas will be minimized and the protection of historical and&#13;
cultural areas will be promoted. The CCDP will focus on analyzing the existing&#13;
conditions and discussing future trends related to land-use patterns, housing, population,&#13;
roadways, social and environmental safeguards, and other infrastructure. Current land&#13;
uses will be determined from existing zoning maps or existing land-use maps. The&#13;
information will be validated through a field survey of existing land uses. The contents of&#13;
a comprehensive plan will consist among others of the following elements:&#13;
land use (both existing and future);&#13;
demographics (existing and projected);&#13;
growth management and strategic plan&#13;
physical expansion&#13;
housing and illegal settlements;&#13;
infrastructure;&#13;
education; health and social services&#13;
open and green spaces&#13;
transportation&#13;
cultural heritage&#13;
Senior advisors will be recruited under the component (US$0.3million) to assist the&#13;
Baghdad city authorities coordinate this exercise. Also, an advisory committee will be&#13;
established to provide direction to the consulting firm responsible for the formulation of&#13;
the CCDP. Throughout the entire comprehensive planning process, citizen input will be&#13;
obtained through a series of open forums and news releases. Written comments from the&#13;
public will be solicited and a citizen survey will be launched as part of the comprehensive&#13;
planning process.&#13;

financed by the World Bank Trust Fund. When this is finalized, by the end of December&#13;
2004, it will provide a general framework for carrying out procurement under Bank&#13;
administered projects. Additionally, it will provide a standard bidding document for use&#13;
under National Competitive Bidding (NCB), samples of different forms for use under&#13;
international and national shopping, direct contracting, and typical forms of evaluation&#13;
reports.&#13;

B.    Assessment of the MOB's capacity to implement procurement&#13;
A preliminary assessment of the MOB's procurement capacity has been carried out by&#13;
Hiba Tahboub, Sr. Procurement Specialist. This assessment is based on discussions with&#13;
MOB staff in Amman, during the pre-appraisal mission in March 2004 and the outcomes&#13;
of an assessment report that was produced by a consultant commissioned by the Bank. A&#13;
brief review of public procurement system in Iraq can be found in the project files.&#13;
Mayoralty of Baghdad is one the largest employers in Iraq. It has 9,000 employees. Large&#13;
projects (US$10- 20million) were implemented by MOB during the oil for food program,&#13;
following UN procurement guidelines. Experience, however during this period is&#13;
predominantly in procurement of equipment and machineries. Whereas, in the eighties&#13;
the MOB implemented projects (works, Goods and consultants) with values in the&#13;
hundreds of millions of US$. Technical specifications are prepared by the design and&#13;
planning departments of MOB.&#13;
Each major department within Mayoralty of Baghdad has its own procurement&#13;
organization, functions, resources, and internal procedures. There is no specialized&#13;
procurement department in the current organizational structure of MOB. International&#13;
procurement is carried out by the Economic and Commercial office within MOB. Local&#13;
procurement is carried out by each department of MOB through a specialized unit.&#13;
International and local procurement are closely coordinated with the Department of&#13;
Administrative Affairs.&#13;
There are separate Committees for Bid Opening, and Bid Analysis and Study, which are&#13;
most often standing committees with members having 6-month appointments; however,&#13;
the latter may be formed on an ad-hoc basis. The Bid Opening Committee opens and&#13;
tabulates the bids. The Analysis and Study Committee evaluates the bids and&#13;
recommends selection of a preferred bidder; it then negotiates with the preferred bidder,&#13;
and if such negotiations are successful it seeks approval from management, before the&#13;
Commercial Department executes the contract.&#13;
Procurement activities under this project will be carried out by a Project Management&#13;
Team (PMT) which is established in MOB under the direct supervision of the Mayor.&#13;
The PMT will be staffed entirely of MOB staff who are transferred from their existing&#13;
departments to work, on full-time basis, as PMT staff. The PMT will closely coordinate&#13;
its daily activities with the different departments of MOB, particularly with Baghdad&#13;
Water and Sewerage Authorities (See annex 3). It is critical that at least one qualified&#13;
procurement staff member be selected prior to the Grant signing. He or she should be&#13;
trained on and become well-versed in Bank procurement procedures within the first three&#13;
months after Grant signing. Such training can be obtained through attending formal&#13;
courses in international institutions that delivers training on Bank procurement.&#13;
Given that the procurement environment which prevailed in Iraq during the last two&#13;
decades was different from the norms of acceptable international practice and the legal&#13;
and regulatory changes introduced by the CPA, public procurement will predictably bear&#13;
40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project      Technical Annex&#13;
a high level of risk in the near future. The risk lies essentially in the lack of good laws&#13;
and regulations, modem standard documentation, lack of training of concerned staff in&#13;
procurement using Bank guidelines and international sound procurement practice, and the&#13;
inability of Bank procurement staff to supervise project in the field.&#13;
On the positive side however, Iraq has a wealth of procurement and engineering staff that&#13;
may be retrained rapidly to operate a reformed procurement system, and use new&#13;
procurement documents and tools as they become available. MOB staff have already&#13;
received two three-week training courses in procurement, financial, and project&#13;
management that were organized by the World Bank in Jordan.&#13;

*   Two procurement officers will be assigned to PMT. These two officers will&#13;
receive both formal and ad-hoc procurement training to efficient handling of the&#13;
procurement activities under the project.&#13;
* An international procurement management firm will be recruited to assist the&#13;
PMT in procurement, financial and project management. This firm would assist&#13;
MOB in establishing a procurement monitoring and reporting system.&#13;
*  Series of training sessions and workshops. will be carried out during appraisal&#13;
throughout project implementation. The target audience would be PMT staff and&#13;
other employees of MOB.&#13;
*  The Master Implementation Manual (expected to be finalized by December 2004&#13;
would be adapted to the particular circumstances of MOB. The MIM would&#13;
provide standard procurement documents, evaluation reports, progress reports,&#13;
filing requirements that would be followed throughout project implementation.&#13;
*  The thresholds for prior review by the Bank are set at a low level, to allow Bank&#13;
staff to provide hands-on training to staff of the PMT.&#13;
*  A Project Launch Workshop would be held in Arabic or with Arabic translation)&#13;
soon after Grant signing. All staff involved in implementation should attend the&#13;
workshop and it will be most critical that this staff be assigned on time.&#13;
* One turn-key, Design and Build (D-B) package, is proposed to be financed under&#13;
the project. There are no Bank standard bidding documents for (DB), however,&#13;
there is sufficient experience within the procurement team in MENA region in&#13;
design-build and operate (D-B-O) contracts that could be easily adapted to the DB&#13;
contracts under the project.&#13;

C.    Procurement Plan&#13;
The MOB, with the assistance of consultants, developed a Procurement Plan for project&#13;
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods (Annex 6). This&#13;
plan was finalized during appraisal and will also be available in the Project's database&#13;
and in the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement&#13;
with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation&#13;
needs and improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
D. Frequency of Procurement Supervision&#13;
In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the&#13;
capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency has recommended four supervision&#13;
missions per year to visit the field to carry out post review of procurement actions. The&#13;
World Bank, as administrator of the Iraq Trust Fund, will employ a Monitoring Agent, an&#13;
independent firm, which will operate in Iraq and support the Bank in carrying out its&#13;
supervision function, including spot checks. In addition, the Bank will rely on reports&#13;
from a local procurement consultant that will work for the Bank from within Iraq. During&#13;
the interim period, Bank staff and the concerned Iraqi procurement staff will meet outside&#13;
Iraq to do off-site supervision as well as use of videoconference facilities.&#13;

Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project        Technical Annex&#13;
Annex 9: Financial Management and Disbursement&#13;
Under the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund, the MOB, as the implementing agency, is the&#13;
Grant recipient. Grant financial resources will be managed by the MOB within the&#13;
framework of its existing financial management system supplemented by the World&#13;
Bank's procurement and financial management procedures. Grant funds will be made&#13;
available to the MOB, which will enter into contractual agreements with suppliers of&#13;
goods, construction companies, contractors, consultants, and vendors for the&#13;
rehabilitation and construction of water supply and sanitation activities financed under&#13;
the project.&#13;
In view of the current security situation, it has not been possible for Bank staff to travel to&#13;
Iraq. In lieu of this, MOB's financial management system and practices were assessed by&#13;
a regional consulting firm. The assessment described the organization structure of the&#13;
MOB and identified the risks associated with the control environment and with the&#13;
accounting, reporting and auditing procedures in place, and proposed actions to reduce&#13;
and manage such risks. This assessment found that the systems in place at the MOB are&#13;
based on principles and procedures defined by the legal framework and operational&#13;
decrees applicable to the public sector in Iraq. These procedures prepare reports based on&#13;
budget line expenditures and include several layers of routine authorization controls. In&#13;
order to mitigate a number of weaknesses identified in the financial management and&#13;
control systems,6, the Bank will introduce additional control measures for the project&#13;
The financial management assessment project files include a copy of the assessment&#13;
report.&#13;
I. Financial Management Risk Assessment&#13;
The financial management risk associated with this operation is considered as high.&#13;
Critical risk factors are: (i) ongoing insecurity, which prevents onsite Bank supervision&#13;
and assessments, including financial management assessments; (ii) the Bank's limited&#13;
knowledge of Iraq's public financial management systems, controls, and procedures; (iii)&#13;
the limited knowledge on the part of Iraqi authorities of Bank policies and guidelines; (iv)&#13;
the possibility of MOB not making available on a timely basis financial resources to&#13;
honor payments below the value of US$10,000; (v) difficult communication and flow of&#13;
information between worksites and the PMT, which could delay payments; (vi)&#13;
inefficiencies in Iraq's banking system that may delay payments and transfer of funds to&#13;
contractors, suppliers, or MOB; and (vii) variation orders that may exceed price&#13;
contingencies and difficulty may be encountered in verifying justification for variation&#13;
orders. Although the project design mitigates to the extent possible these risks, the&#13;
project will require close monitoring and supervision during implementation. A detailed&#13;
risk assessment is in Section VII.&#13;
6A special-purpose audit conducted by an international firm covering selected Iraqi ministries had&#13;
identified major irregularities in disbursement transactions and significant control breaches.&#13;
53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project     Technical Annex&#13;
II. Risk Mitigating Measures&#13;
The overall high risk will be partially mitigated by putting in place additional controls&#13;
and procedures specific to the project.&#13;
The control risks will be partially mitigated by putting in place additional controls&#13;
including: (a) the PMT will be assigned competent financial staff from the MOB, who&#13;
will be supported by a financial management consultant (b) the PMT will verify and&#13;
authorize payments under the project and verify justification for variation orders;(c) the&#13;
Mayor will designate internal auditor to track and verity on ex-ante basis the project&#13;
activities and financial transactions; (d) disbursements by the Bank will be made by&#13;
direct payments to suppliers, contractors and consultants for amounts above US$10,000&#13;
and reimbursement of expenditures supported by full documentation for smaller amounts;&#13;
(e) the fiduciary Monitoring Agent will review project expenditures and review&#13;
withdrawal applications; (f) training will be provided to the PMT staff and staff assigned&#13;
to the project upon project launch.(g) the internal audit department at MOB will maintain&#13;
a project log-book reflecting the details of all payments made against each contract to&#13;
avoid overpayment; and (h) close control will be exercised on all project documents and&#13;
payment supporting documents at the PMT.&#13;
The accounting and reporting risks will be managed by putting in place a simple parallel&#13;
computerized system (i.e., spreadsheet applications) able to record all project&#13;
expenditures and follow on the project commitments in real time during the&#13;
implementation period and able to provide the needed data for the generation of project&#13;
reports including the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR). The project expected number&#13;
of accounting transactions is estimated around five hundred transactions per year.&#13;
III. Financial Management Arrangements&#13;
Accounting System. MOB currently uses a manual accounting system. To avoid the risk&#13;
of the MOB not being able to generate timely reports for project management and&#13;
monitoring purposes, parallel arrangements will be implemented to overcome this&#13;
shortcoming. The project accounting and reporting activities will be undertaken by the&#13;
PMT but in conjunction with MOB control procedures and applicable laws. A simple&#13;
computerized spreadsheet accounting system will be used to track the grant accounts.&#13;
Flow of Information. The rehabilitation of the municipal water system will take place&#13;
throughout the greater Baghdad area and its districts. As per applicable laws all invoices,&#13;
or work orders, will be signed and approved by the planning/engineering departments in&#13;
the districts and will be remitted to the PMT for payment under cover letter signed by the&#13;
district director (site manager). Contracting and payment processes will be centralized at&#13;
the PMT level. The PMT will maintain an up-to-date invoices register and general ledger&#13;
to record all payments incurred. All financial transactions will be verified on ex-ante&#13;
basis by the at the internal audit department by internal auditor designated to the project.&#13;
Project Financial Management Procedures. The project financial management&#13;
procedures and the parallel accounting system that are managed by the PMT will be&#13;
54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project      Technical Annex&#13;
detailed in the project implementation plan that will be prepared by the PMT no later than&#13;
March 31, 2005. These procedures will be in line with the Master Implementation&#13;
Manual.&#13;
IV. Project Reports&#13;
Project reports should be remitted to the Bank following the agreed format and&#13;
frequency. The proposed format of the reports is in the project files and was agreed upon&#13;
with the MOB representatives during negotiations.&#13;
Ouarterlv Reports. The MOB will generate Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs)&#13;
and submit them to the Bank as part of the project progress report, or separately, within&#13;
45 days from the end of the quarter. These reports include two sections:&#13;
* Financial Reports will include a cash flow statement, beginning and ending&#13;
project cash balances and an expenditure report by activity or contract comparing&#13;
actual and planned expenditures. Also, a narrative report explaining major&#13;
variances compared to plan and the proposed corrective actions should be&#13;
included as an annex to the financial reports.&#13;
* Contracts Reports will provide information on the major rehabilitation and&#13;
construction contracts, showing contract financial status against plan, including&#13;
information on all authorized contract variations.&#13;
Annual Reports. Audited Project Financial Statements that will be submitted to the&#13;
Bank not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year, will include:&#13;
1. Statement of sources and utilization of funds, indicating funds received and&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
2. Appropriate schedules classifying project activities, showing cumulative balances.&#13;
3. Statement of payments made using statement of expenditures procedures, if&#13;
allowed later by the Bank, as defined in the legal agreement.&#13;
Renortinf To Donors. The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts&#13;
in respect of the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF. Within&#13;
ninety (90) days of the end of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, and&#13;
December 31), the Bank will prepare, on a cash basis, an unaudited statements of&#13;
receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to&#13;
each donor. Each such statement will be expressed in United States Dollars, the currency&#13;
in which the ITF funds will be maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one hundred&#13;
and eighty (180) days of the completion of all disbursements relating to activities&#13;
financed from the ITF, the Bank will prepare on a cash basis an unaudited financial&#13;
statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and&#13;
forward a copy to each donor.&#13;
The Bank will furnish to the donors:&#13;
55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project     Technical Annex&#13;
a.    on a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of&#13;
the ITF (including contributions, disbursements, and implementation progress) in&#13;
the preceding six months; and&#13;
b.    on an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation&#13;
from the Bank's external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal control&#13;
over cash-based financial reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
V. Auditing Arrangements&#13;
An external independent auditor with international experience will be engaged to perform&#13;
the project audit and issue an independent opinion on the project financial statements.&#13;
The external audit report will encompass all project activities and will be presented in&#13;
accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards. MOB will remit a project&#13;
audit report to the Bank not later than six months after year end. The auditor selection&#13;
process will be launched directly after the grant agreement is signed. In addition to the&#13;
audit reports, the auditor will prepare a "management letter" identifying any observations,&#13;
comments, and deficiencies in the system and controls that the auditor considers&#13;
pertinent, and will provide recommendations for their improvements. The audit will&#13;
cover the expenditures made through direct payments as well as expenditures reimbursed&#13;
to the MOB in terms of their substantiation and their eligibility and compliance with the&#13;
grant agreement. An escrow account will be used to pay the auditor after the project&#13;
closing date.&#13;
VI. Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen institutional&#13;
capacity by financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries and other&#13;
recipient entities. Trained PMTs will facilitate implementation and help ensure&#13;
compliance with fiduciary and other safeguards. PMTs will be employed and paid by the&#13;
implementing entity at regular salary levels, thereby avoiding the disadvantages of stand-&#13;
alone Project Implementation Units that can erode institutional capacity over the medium&#13;
and long term. The project will finance specialized technical support in procurement,&#13;
financial management, and other areas as needed. In addition, to ensure that project funds&#13;
are used for the purposes intended and to help carry out project supervision, the Bank will&#13;
employ two independent firms as Monitoring Agents.&#13;
As a further compensating control, disbursements will be made primarily by direct&#13;
payment by the Bank to the contractors, consultants, and vendors. Once authorized by the&#13;
PMT, direct payments will be made by the World Bank directly into the account of the&#13;
contractor, consultant, or vendor in a commercial bank capable of receiving funds&#13;
transferred from the international banking system.&#13;
The project management component and payments below the threshold of US$10,000&#13;
normally will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own resources. These&#13;
payments made from the Recipient's own resources will be reimbursed, on a periodic&#13;
basis, by the Bank to the MOB upon presentation of relevant supporting documents,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project                    Technical Annex&#13;
proof of payment, and a signed withdrawal applications. The PMT and the main financial&#13;
counterparts from the MOB will be given intensive training in the Bank's disbursement&#13;
procedures.&#13;
Use of Statements of Expenditures. Initially, supporting documentation will be&#13;
provided to the Bank for all requests to disburse funds under the Grant. The Bank has the&#13;
option to allow expenditures under US$10,000 to be made by means of Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). If SOEs are allowed, the supporting documentation will be&#13;
maintained at the PMT of MOB and made available for review by Bank representatives&#13;
upon request; any documentation relating to SOEs will be retained for up to one year&#13;
from the date the Bank receives the final project audit report.&#13;

disbursements from the proceeds of the grants,&#13;
supervise project accounts, retain financial records, and&#13;
prepare project reports. The team will be assisted by a&#13;
FM consultant. The Bank also engaged a consulting&#13;
firm to prepare a Master Implementation Manual to be&#13;
used by all projects financed under the Iraq Trust Fund.&#13;

of supervision will be required initially in order to ensure that the PMT and the MOB&#13;
finance staff are well trained in the use of Bank guidelines and procedures. Where&#13;
security conditions make travel to Iraq impossible for Bank staff, the Bank will employ&#13;
an independent firm as fiduciary Monitoring Agent, which will operate in Iraq and&#13;
support the Bank in carrying out its supervision function.&#13;

Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project       Technical Annex&#13;
Annex 10: Environmental and Social Safeguards Assessment Framework&#13;
A) Introduction and Purpose of ESSAF&#13;
The purpose of this Framework is to assist the Project Implementing Agency&#13;
(Municipality of Baghdad) in screening all the subprojects for their likely social and&#13;
environmental impacts, detailing the required measures for their proper implementation&#13;
and monitoring.&#13;
This project specific SSAF draws from the generic and overarching framework agreed&#13;
upon with the Government of Iraq for all reconstruction and rehabilitation projects to be&#13;
implemented on an emergency basis, and is especially tailored to the specific issues&#13;
identified for the proposed intervention.&#13;
The Project, Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation aims at restoring basic&#13;
water supply and sanitation services for the capital city of Baghdad through:&#13;
(a) Carrying out reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing priority networks and&#13;
treatment facilities; and,&#13;
(b) Providing capacity building support through training and technical assistance.&#13;
The project also provides support to the Municipality of Baghdad (MOB) to better&#13;
manage projects at the design, supervision, operation and maintenance stages by building&#13;
the capacity of the staff working in the water supply and sanitation sector. It also includes&#13;
the development of a Comprehensive City Development Plan (CCDP) to ensure that&#13;
future expansion of the water supply and sanitation networks are in line with the overall&#13;
urban development plan for the city. Project components are summarized below:&#13;
'Component 1 - Rehabilitation of chlorine and chemical units at Al-Karkh&#13;
Water Treatment Plant. (Estimated cost of US$2.8 million)&#13;
Al-Karkh Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was constructed in 1985 and is one of the&#13;
largest treatment plants in the world with a total capacity of 1,365 million liters per day&#13;
(MLD). The source of raw water is the River Tigris and water treated by the plant&#13;
supplies 65% of the total water demand of Baghdad. Over the last 14 years, due to&#13;
unavailability of spare parts and damaged equipment, chlorine leakages have affected the&#13;
plant efficiency. This component will serve to both improve the reliability and&#13;
efficiency of the chlorination and chemical processes and increase safety by&#13;
installing new automatic chlorinators and rehabilitating the ventilation system.&#13;
&gt; Component 2 - Rehabilitation of 2B pumping station in Shark Dijla Water&#13;
Treatment Plant. (Estimated cost of US$4.5 million)&#13;
60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project      Technical Annex&#13;
Baghdad is located on the two sides of the Tigris River. It receives its potable water from&#13;
two principal water treatment plants (WTPs), namely Al-Karkh WTP (mentioned above)&#13;
on the west side (Karkh district), and the Shark Dijla WTP (540 MLD), on the east side&#13;
(Rasafa District). In 1989, a 820 MLD blending station, referred to as the 2B pumping&#13;
station, was added to the Shark Dijla WTP to receive potable water from Al Karkh WTP&#13;
and pump it to the Rasafa district. This pumping station has not been renovated since the&#13;
90s and is in dire need of repair. This component will address rehabilitation of the 2B&#13;
pumping station at the Shark Dijla WTP.&#13;
&gt; Component 3 - Extension and rehabilitation of Al-Rasheed WTP. (Estimated&#13;
cost of US$7.2 million)&#13;
This is an old WTP with a design capacity of 68 MLD, which was designed to supply&#13;
potable water to the Zaafarania suburb (350,000 inhabitants). It is currently in poor shape&#13;
and unable to meet the current demand of the community. This component covers the&#13;
expansion rehabilitation and upgrading of the plant to treat the highly polluted raw&#13;
water of the Tigris water at this location. It also covers rehabilitation and&#13;
strengthening of the water mains, storage tanks, pumping stations and chlorinators.&#13;
&gt; Component 4 - Rehabilitation of the Abu Nuwas Raw Water Pumping&#13;
Station. (Estimated cost of US$6.2 million)&#13;
This pumping station was destroyed completely and vandalized in the latest conflict. The&#13;
Abu Nuwas pumping station contains four vertical pumps of a 3,600 m3/hr capacity and&#13;
two vertical pumps of a 1,800 m3/hr capacity together with all related works. Currently,&#13;
only two pumps of 3600 m3/hr are operational; the proposed component will&#13;
completely rehabilitate the electrical and mechanical equipment in the station to&#13;
increase the pumping capacity to 18,000 m3 /hr.&#13;
&gt; Component 5 - Rehabilitation and renewal of Sadr City Sewerage Network.&#13;
(Estimated cost of US$15.0 million)&#13;
The Al-Thawra city comprises 80 districts with a population of about 2 million&#13;
inhabitants. Currently the city experiences frequent back-ups of sewage to streets and&#13;
adjacent neighborhoods. This is due largely to broken pipes, lack of maintenance and&#13;
inadequate rehabilitation. This component will provide rehabilitation of secondary&#13;
sewers ranging in size between 200-400mm sewer pipes in part of Sadr city and it&#13;
surrounding areas, including the addition of house connections, serving&#13;
approximately 200,000 inhabitants. Sewage would flow through the existing trunk&#13;
mains to the Rustumiya Wastewater Treatment Plant.&#13;
&gt; Component 6 - Rehabilitation and Renewal of Drinking Water Network in&#13;
Za'afarania. ( Estimated cost of US$15.4 million)&#13;
61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project      Technical Annex&#13;
Al-Zaafarania is one of the poorest districts in the Karrada Municipality of Baghdad&#13;
Governorate. The area has a population of approximately 350,000 whose current source&#13;
of water are water tankers of uncontrolled quality. Expenditure on water typically&#13;
comprises 20% of the average family's monthly income. This component includes the&#13;
supply and installation of water pipes of varying diameters and house connections to&#13;
provide adequate water supplies for domestic and commercial use. This component&#13;
will also improve the economic conditions of the population by reducing the&#13;
purchase of water from unregulated tankers, and contribute to the reduction in the&#13;
incidence of water borne diseases by providing safe potable water.&#13;
&gt; Component 7 - Technical Assistance and Capacity Building. (Estimated total&#13;
of US$3.9 million)&#13;
This component is essential to ensure the proper implementation of the project and to&#13;
train MOB staff on efficient utility practices and financing. It will include the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
-    . Consulting services to complete final designs and tender documents;&#13;
* Consulting services for construction and implementation supervision;&#13;
* Capacity building and training in specific technical, environmental and&#13;
social and commercial areas;&#13;
. Design and implementation of appropriate accounting, financial&#13;
management, information, billing and collection, and related systems;&#13;
* Consulting services to asses demand characteristics, cost of supply, demand&#13;
management and tariff structures;&#13;
* Audits;&#13;
. Individual consultants to support the Project Management Team (PMT);&#13;
* Office equipment, vehicles, furniture and operation costs for the Project;&#13;
and,&#13;
* Feasibility studies and final designs for follow-up projects.&#13;
Component 8 - Development of a Comprehensive City Development Plan for&#13;
Baghdad (CCDP). (Estimated cost of US$3.0 million)&#13;
Around 23% of Iraq's total population lives in the capital Baghdad, where the population&#13;
is estimated to be 6 million. The city has experienced intense urbanization due to years of&#13;
economic sanctions where key economic and social activities became concentrated in the&#13;
capital. Baghdad has been developing in the absence of effective planning and has grown&#13;
well beyond its planned limits. Spontaneous informal settlements became established in&#13;
and around the city. The latest attempt at formulating a Comprehensive City&#13;
Development Plan (CCDP) for Baghdad was carried-out during the late eighties. The&#13;
process was highly centralized and failed to adequately incorporate social, economic and&#13;
environmental considerations. A CCDP is proposed to carry the vision for the future of&#13;
Baghdad for the year 2030. The CCDP will focus on analyzing the existing conditions&#13;
and discussing future trends related to land-use patterns, physical expansion,&#13;

B) Safeguards Assessment&#13;
This operation will be implemented in compliance with the following applicable Safeguards&#13;
Policies of the World Bank as well as the Emergency Recovery Loan Policy of the Bank (O.P.&#13;
8.50).&#13;
OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment. Most of the proposed subprojects are likely to&#13;
focus on the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction and upgrading (where necessary) of priority&#13;
networks and treatment facilities. The work in these areas will be done in compliance with the&#13;
World Bank Environmental Assessment Safeguards Policy (OP 4.01).&#13;
Considering the nature and magnitude of potential environmental impacts of rehabilitation and&#13;
reconstruction works, the proposed operations are classified as category 'B'. For subprojects&#13;
with potential adverse impacts, a limited Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will be done&#13;
during project implementation (in compliance with O.P 4.01 in the case of emergency operations&#13;
as defined by Emergency Recovery Loan Policy 8.50), particularly if new sewer lines are built&#13;
and when dealing with chlorination units. TORs attached to this document will have to be&#13;
followed. One such EMP is for the Rustumiya Wastewater Treatment Plant including among&#13;
other activities close monitoring of influents and effluents. For the rest of the subprojects with&#13;
limited potential adverse impacts and prior to appraisal, the implementing agency will agree to&#13;
apply the following minimum standards during implementation: 1) completing the check list in&#13;
attachment 2; 2) consider attachment 3 if applicable; 3) inclusion of standard environmental code&#13;
of practice (ECOP) for water and wastewater in the repair and reconstruction bid documents of all&#13;
subprojects; 4) review and oversight of any major reconstruction works by specialists; 5)&#13;
implementation of environmentally and socially sound options for disposal of debris; and 6)&#13;
provisions for adequate budget and satisfactory institutional arrangements for monitoring&#13;
effective implementation. In all components, necessary measures to ensure compliance with the&#13;
ESSAF and due diligence will be observed.&#13;
OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. The need for involuntary resettlement or land&#13;
acquisition in specific subproject areas will only be known during project implementation, when&#13;
site-specific plans are available. In the above sub projects, it might be that acquisition of linear&#13;
stretches of land is necessary for the construction of new sewer lines. Therefore, subprojects will&#13;
be screened for triggering of the resettlement policy. Any subprojects involving involuntary&#13;
resettlement or land acquisition will only be approved after preparation of a resettlement plan&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The safeguards framework will therefore include procedures for&#13;
identifying people who will be affected by the sub-projects and for proper determination of&#13;
appropriate compensation.&#13;
OPN 11.03 Cultural Property. Operations may pose limited risks of damaging cultural&#13;
property in the city of Baghdad, particularly if excavations are required, but assuming that they&#13;
will not include large-scale excavations, movement of earth or demolition. Nevertheless, projects&#13;
and subprojects will be reviewed for their potential impact on cultural property and clear&#13;
procedures will be required for identification, protection of cultural property from theft, and&#13;
treatment of discovered artifacts, and will be included in standard bidding documents. Even in&#13;
the case cultural property is not damaged by the project activities, identification of later assistance&#13;
63&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project            Technical Annex&#13;
for the preservation of historic or archaeological sites might be carried out. If these opportunities&#13;
occur, cultural property management plans would be prepared for those subprojects.&#13;
OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways. A     waiver/exceptions to the&#13;
notification requirements under paragraph 7(a) of the policy OP 7.5 has been sought&#13;
after and cleared on November 15,2004. Components affecting the Tigris waters will be&#13;
screened in checklist attachment 2 to identify environmental issues and Environmental&#13;
Management Plan(s) will be undertaken when issues will need to be managed. Decisions&#13;
on actions and requirements will be made with the concurrence of the Bank.&#13;
IV.    Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation of subprojects will be&#13;
consistent with the following guidelines, codes of practice and requirements.&#13;
* A list of negative characteristics rendering a proposed subproject ineligible for&#13;
support (Attachment 1);&#13;
*: A proposed checklist of likely environment and social impacts to be filled out for&#13;
each subproject or group of subprojects (Attachment 2);&#13;
* Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation(Attachment&#13;
3);&#13;
*: Procedures for the protection of cultural property, including the chance discovery of&#13;
archaeological artefacts, unrecorded graveyards and burial sites(Attachment 4);&#13;
*: Relevant elements of the codes of practice for the prevention and mitigation of&#13;
potential environmental impacts (Attachment 5); and&#13;
*: A sample Environmental Safeguards procedures as a basis for additional requirement&#13;
to the Contracts Technical Specifications (Attachment 6).&#13;
*: An EMP for sub projects identified as having adverse impacts and affecting a large&#13;
number of people for which TORs will have to be prepared and an independent&#13;
consultant hired, Note that the EMPs will be prepared prior to construction&#13;
(Attachment 7).&#13;
V.     Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
The mayoralty of Baghdad will act as the implementation agency responsible for&#13;
applying the safeguard screening and mitigation requirements to its own subprojects.  A&#13;
Safeguards Focal Point (SFP) will be identified in the mayoralty with responsibility for&#13;
overseeing the implementation of the Framework.&#13;
VI.    Capacity-Building and Monitoring of Safeguard Framework Implementation&#13;
As part of the capacity-building to be provided for implementation of the proposed&#13;
operations, the Safeguards Focal Points and relevant staff of the concerned Ministries will also&#13;
receive training in ESSAF's application.&#13;
64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project           Technical Annex&#13;
To assist in this capacity-building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review of the&#13;
ESSAF's application, the World Bank and the Iraqi government will contract an international&#13;
monitoring agency for the monitoring and supervision of the safeguards. During supervision of&#13;
these operations, the World Bank will assess the implementation of the ESSAF, and recommend&#13;
additional strengthening, if required.&#13;
VII.   Consultation and Disclosure&#13;
This ESSAF will be shared with the different stakeholders, with the concerned&#13;
nongovernmental organizations and with participating development partners. It will be disclosed&#13;
in Arabic and English by the Mayoralty of Baghdad (proponent) and will be made available at the&#13;
World Bank's InfoShop. Relevant subproject specific safeguard documents/mitigation and&#13;
environmental management plans prepared subsequently will also be disclosed. A letter from the&#13;
Mayoralty to the Bank will authorize disclosure through the Bank's InfoShop and will specify the&#13;
modalities of disclosure in-country.&#13;
The proposed operations will support a number of environmental management plans,&#13;
feasibility and detailed design studies for future infrastructure investments for which World Bank&#13;
safeguard policies relating to consultation and disclosure may apply.&#13;

Attachment 3&#13;
Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements and Compensation&#13;
I.     Objectives&#13;
I.     Resettlement and land acquisition will be kept to a minimum, and will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with these guidelines. Subproject proposals that would require demolishing houses or&#13;
acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to minimize or avoid their impacts&#13;
through alternative alignments. Proposals that require more than minor expansion along rights of&#13;
way should be carefully reviewed. No land or asset acquisition may take place outside of these&#13;
guidelines. A format for a Land Acquisition Assessment Data Sheet is attached as Attachment&#13;
3(i).&#13;
2.     These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate negatively affected&#13;
persons to ensure that they will be assisted to improve, or at least to restore, their living standards,&#13;
income earning or production capacity to pre-project levels regardless of their land tenure status.&#13;
II.    Categorization&#13;
3.     Based on the number of persons that may be affected by the project, Project Affected&#13;
People (PAPs) and the magnitude of impacts, projects will be categorized as follows:&#13;
(a) Projects that will affect more than 200 PAPs due to land acquisition and/or physical&#13;
relocation and where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced. If the&#13;
RAP cannot be prepared prior to project appraisal, a waiver can be provided by the&#13;
World Bank Managing Director (MD) in consultation with the Resettlement&#13;
Committee. In such cases, the TT should agree with the Borrower on a timetable for&#13;
preparation of the RAP.&#13;
(b) Projects that will affect less than 200 persons require the following documentation:&#13;
(i) a land acquisition assessment, (ii) the minutes or record of consultations&#13;
which assess the compensation claimed and agreement reached, and (iii) a&#13;
record of the receipt of the compensation, or voluntary donation, by those&#13;
affected (see below).&#13;
(c) Projects that are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant&#13;
adverse social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and&#13;
improved livelihoods are expected from such interventions.&#13;
m.     Eligibility&#13;
4.     PAPs are identified as persons whose livelihood is directly affected by the project due to&#13;
acquisition of the land owned or used by them. PAPs deemed eligible for compensation are:&#13;
(a) those who have formal legal rights to land, water resources or structures/buildings,&#13;
including recognized customary and traditional rights;&#13;
72&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project            Technical Annex&#13;
(b) those who do not have such formal legal rights but have a claim to usufruct rights&#13;
rooted in customary law; and&#13;
(c) those whose claim to land and water resources or building/structures do not fall&#13;
within (a) and (b) above, are eligible to resettlement assistance to restore their&#13;
livelihood.&#13;
IV.    Acquisition of Productive Assets and Compensation&#13;
5.     PAPs are eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as described below:&#13;
(a) Voluntary contributions. Individuals may elect to voluntarily contribute land or&#13;
assets provided the persons making such contributions do so willingly and are&#13;
informed that they have the right to refuse such contributions; and&#13;
(b) Contributions against compensation. A contributor/asset loser considered "affected"&#13;
will be eligible for compensation and other necessary assistance.&#13;
6.     Voluntary contribution should be clearly documented to confirm the voluntary nature of&#13;
the transition.  The documentation should specify that the land is free of any squatters,&#13;
encroachers or other claims. A format is shown in Attachment 3(i), which includes a Schedule&#13;
for assessing any compensation claimed and the agreement reached.&#13;
V.     Compensation Principles&#13;
7.     The project implementation agencies will ensure timely provision of the following means&#13;
of compensation to affected peoples:&#13;
(a) Project affected peoples losing access to a portion of their land or other productive&#13;
assets with the remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to&#13;
compensation at a replacement cost for that portion of land or assets lost to them.&#13;
Compensation for the lost assets will be made according to the following principles:&#13;
(i)  replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent&#13;
productive assets;&#13;
(ii) materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be&#13;
demolished;&#13;
(iii) replacement of damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value;&#13;
(iv) other acceptable in-kind compensation;&#13;
(v)  in case of cash compensation, the delivery of compensation should be made in&#13;
public, i.e., at the Community Meeting; and&#13;
(vi) in case of physical relocation, provision of civic infrastructure at the&#13;
resettlement sites.&#13;
73&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project            Technical Annex&#13;
(b) Project affected peoples losing access to a portion of their land or other economic&#13;
assets rendering the remainder economically non-viable will have the options of&#13;
compensation for the entire asset by provision of alternative land, cash or equivalent&#13;
productive asset, according to the principles in (a) i-iv above.&#13;
VI.       Consultation Process&#13;
8.     The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants of land and owners of assets&#13;
located in a proposed subproject area are consulted. Community meetings will be held in each&#13;
affected district and village to inform the local population of their rights to compensation and&#13;
options available in accordance with these Guidelines. The Minutes of the community meetings&#13;
shall reflect the discussions held, agreements reached, and include details of the agreement, based&#13;
on the format provided in Attachment 3(ii).&#13;
9.     The implementing agency shall provide a copy of the Minutes to affected people and&#13;
confirm in discussions with each of them, their requests and preferences for compensation,&#13;
agreements reached, and any eventual complaint. Copies will be recorded in the posted project&#13;
documentation and be available for inspection during supervision.&#13;
Subproject Approval&#13;
10.   In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the&#13;
implementing agency shall: ,&#13;
(a) not approve the subproject unless satisfactory compensation has been agreed between&#13;
the affected person and the local community; and&#13;
(b) not allow works to start until the compensation has been delivered in a satisfactory&#13;
manner to the affected persons.&#13;
Complaints and Grievances&#13;
11.   Initially, all complaints should be negotiated to reach an agreement at the local&#13;
community/village/district level. If this fails, complaints and grievances on these Guidelines,&#13;
implementation of the agreements recorded in the Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged&#13;
irregularity in carrying out the project can also be addressed by the affected peoples or their&#13;
representative at the municipal or district level. If this also fails, the complaint may be submitted&#13;
to the relevant implementing agency for consideration.&#13;
Verification&#13;
12.   The Community Meeting Minutes, including agreements of compensation and evidence&#13;
of compensation made shall be provided to the Municipality/district, to the supervising engineers,&#13;
who will maintain a record hereof, and to auditors and socio-economic monitors when they&#13;
undertake reviews and post-project assessment. This process shall be specified in all relevant&#13;
project documents, including details of the relevant authority for complaints at the&#13;
municipal/district or implementing agency level.&#13;

Attachment 4&#13;
Protection of Cultural Property&#13;
I.     Cultural property include monuments, structures, works of art, or sites of significance&#13;
points of view, and are defined as sites and structures having archaeological, historical,&#13;
architectural, or religious significance, and natural sites with cultural values. This includes&#13;
cemeteries, graveyards and graves.&#13;
2.     The initial phase of the proposed emergency reconstruction operations pose limited risks&#13;
of damaging cultural property since subprojects will largely consist of small investments in&#13;
community infrastructure and income generating activities, reconstruction of existing structures,&#13;
and minor public works. Further, the list of negative subproject attributes, which would make a&#13;
subproject ineligible for support (Attachment 1), includes any activity that would adversely&#13;
impact cultural property. Nevertheless, the following procedures for identification, protection&#13;
from theft, and treatment of discovered artifacts should be followed and included in standard&#13;
bidding documents as provided in Attachment 6.&#13;
Chance Find Procedures&#13;
3.     Chance find procedures will be used as follows:&#13;
(a) Stop the construction activities in the area of the chance find;&#13;
(b) Delineate the discovered site or area;&#13;
(c) Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects. In cases of&#13;
removable antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the&#13;
responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture take over;&#13;
(d) Notify the supervisory Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible local&#13;
authorities and the Ministry of Culture immediately (within 24 hours or less);&#13;
(e) Responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture would be in charge of&#13;
protecting and preserving the site before deciding on subsequent appropriate&#13;
procedures. This would require a preliminary evaluation of the findings to be&#13;
performed by the archaeologists of the Ministry of Culture (within 72 hours). The&#13;
significance and importance of the findings should be assessed according to the&#13;
various criteria relevant to cultural heritage; those include the aesthetic, historic,&#13;
scientific or research, social and economic values;&#13;
(f) Decisions on how to handle the finding shall be taken by the responsible authorities&#13;
and the Ministry of Culture. This could include changes in the layout (such as when&#13;
finding an irremovable remain of cultural or archaeological importance)&#13;
conservation, preservation, restoration and salvage;&#13;
(g) Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management of the finding&#13;
shall be communicated in writing by the Ministry of Culture; and&#13;
(h) Construction work could resume only after permission is given from the responsible&#13;
local authorities and the Ministry of Culture conceming safeguard of the heritage.&#13;
4.     These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts,&#13;
when applicable, and as proposed in section 1.5 of Attachment 6. During project supervision, the&#13;
Site Engineer shall monitor the above regulations relating to the treatment of any chance find&#13;
encountered are observed.&#13;

TOR PREPARATION: KEY ISSUES AND OUTPUT - WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION&#13;
REQUIRED EXPERTISE&#13;
1. The consulting team should have:&#13;
* General EA experience;&#13;
* Environmental specialists;&#13;
2. And expertise in the following areas:&#13;
* hydrology;&#13;
* environmental engineering;&#13;
* water quality modelling;&#13;
* ecology (terrestrial, aquatic, and possibly marine depending on receiving environment);&#13;
* water quality;&#13;
* soil science (for land application of sludge);&#13;
* wastewater utility management; and&#13;
* social assessment and public participation.&#13;
3. Other specialties that may be needed, depending on the nature of the project, are public health,&#13;
agronomy, land use planning, oceanography and resource economics.&#13;
Key Issues&#13;
1. It is important to note that projects in this sector could range from the very large, such as the&#13;
development or rehabilitation of a city water supply/distribution system and wastewater&#13;
collection/treatment system, to smaller scale, targeted improvements to existing systems or&#13;
construction of a new municipal wastewater treatment plant. The scope and number of issues&#13;
involved will depend to a great extent on the magnitude and complexity of the project.&#13;
1. Key issues in Iraq for an EA in this sector will include:&#13;
Land Use and Siting&#13;
*  Water treatment and wastewater treatment plants facilities require tracts of land for treatment&#13;
facilities, storage, offices and laboratories, and access roads.&#13;
* Smaller dispersed plots may be required for peripheral pumping stations.&#13;
* Elevation relative to the municipality is often a key siting factor to optimize gravity flow and&#13;
reduce or minimize reliance on pumps.&#13;
* Suitable land is often a limited resource, and facility location could require resettlement of&#13;
both titled landowners and squatters and/or the taking of agricultural land.&#13;
* Potential impacts of wastewater treatment plant on local communities including odor and&#13;
reduction in property values.&#13;
87&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project           Technical Annex&#13;
Water Resources&#13;
*  The population of the IRAQ region is growing rapidly, and the primary sources of water in&#13;
this arid and semi-arid region are non-renewable fossil aquifers.&#13;
*  Allocation: exploitation of an aquifer for municipal supply may necessitate use restrictions&#13;
on other users.&#13;
*  It is essential to control and prevent further contamination of freshwater water resources&#13;
(ground and surface water) through discharge of untreated or inadequately treated domestic,&#13;
municipal and industrial wastewater.&#13;
*  Equally important is the conservation of scarce water resources through demand side&#13;
management and efficient allocation and use of water.&#13;
*  Pollution of coastal waters by domestic, municipal and industrial wastewater is also a serious&#13;
problem.&#13;
!  Water re-use for agriculture (the reader is recommended to the World Health Organization's&#13;
(WHO) publication Health guidelines for the use of wastewater in agriculture and&#13;
aquaculture (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 778, 1989).&#13;
Socio-economic&#13;
*  Demand side management of water supplies will typically involve pricing increases, and&#13;
willingness/ability to pay for the poorer segments of society will likely be an issue.&#13;
*  In some countries, the poorer segments of the populace prefer to continue using contaminated&#13;
water to avoid the costs of associated with treated water.&#13;
*  Similarly, cost recovery for wastewater treatment services may adversely impact the poorer&#13;
segments of the society.&#13;
Public Health&#13;
*  Contamination of potable water by domestic and industrial effluent is common place in many&#13;
countries of the region.&#13;
*  Municipal wastewater contamination causes high incidences of illness and death from water&#13;
borne diseases including dysentery and cholera.&#13;
*  Industrial wastewater contributes toxic or harmful contaminants including oil and grease,&#13;
heavy metals, acids and PCBs.&#13;
*  Agricultural sources contribute fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides.&#13;
*  Sludge management and disposal.&#13;
Public Consultation&#13;
*  Public consultation has not traditionally been strong in the IRAQ region. It is important that&#13;
EA for all projects take the necessary measures to ensure adequate public consultation.&#13;
*  Gender and communication issues must be carefully considered and incorporated in the&#13;
design of public consultation exercises and in the dissemination of project information.&#13;
THE EA STUDY AND REPORT&#13;
1. Consultants are required to carry out an EA study and prepare an EA report according to the&#13;
World Bank standards. The report should include the following sections:&#13;

1       Key Output for EA of Water Supply and Sanitation Project (in addition to Box 1.2)&#13;
Policy, Legal, and   Tables should be used to list applicable standards and note which authorities are responsible for their&#13;
Administrative       application. Where there are no relevant local standards, suitable international norms may be used.&#13;
Framework:           The World Bank's General Environmental Guidelines, which would apply to projects of this type, are&#13;
provided in Annex III.&#13;
Specifically, the TOR should describe the pertinent regulations and standards goveming&#13;
environmental quality, pollutant discharges to surface waters and land, industrial discharges to public&#13;
sewers, water reclamation and reuse, agricultural and landscape use of sludge, health and safety,&#13;
protection of sensitive areas, protection of endangered species, siting, land use control, etc., at&#13;
intemational, national, regional and local levels (The TOR should specify those that are known and&#13;
require the consultant to investigate for others).&#13;
Project Objectives   This section should describe the need for and target consumer of the water network in the context of&#13;
and Description:     the local and national water supply and sanitation strategy. The effect on economic and social&#13;
development goals of the locality, country and region should be described. If the project is an element&#13;
of an overall sanitation program in the area, then a description of the other program elements must be&#13;
presented.&#13;
A physical and engineering description of the project should be provided including at least the&#13;
following:&#13;
* Location&#13;
* water supply source&#13;
* general layout (e.g. distribution and/or collection systems, pumping stations, treatment works,&#13;
intakes and outfalls)&#13;
* unit process description and diagram&#13;
* size in terms of population and population equivalents, present and projected&#13;
* number and types of connected industries&#13;
* anticipated influent and effluent characteristics&#13;
* pre-construction and construction activities&#13;
* schedule, staffing and support facilities and services&#13;
* operation and maintenance activities&#13;
* required off-site investments&#13;
* life span&#13;
Baseline Data        The key categories of data needed for a water supply and sanitation EA include the following:&#13;
Physical Environment&#13;
* geology (general description for overall study area and details for land application sites)&#13;
* topography&#13;
* soils (general description for overall study area and details for land application sites);&#13;
* monthly average temperatures, (rainfall) and runoff characteristics&#13;
* description of receiving waters (identity of streams, lakes, or marine waters; annual average&#13;
discharge or current data by month, chemical quality; existing discharges or withdrawals).&#13;
90&#13;

Baseline Data&#13;
continued....        Biological Environment&#13;
*  Terrestrial communities in areas affected by construction facility siting land application or&#13;
disposal;&#13;
* Aquatic, estuarine or marine communities in affected waters;&#13;
* Rare or endangered species;&#13;
* Sensitive habitats, including parks or preserves, significant natural sites;&#13;
* Species of commercial importance in land application sites and receiving waters.&#13;
Socio-cultural Environment&#13;

* Distribution of income, goods and services;&#13;
* Recreation;&#13;
* Public health;&#13;
* Cultural properties; indigenous peoples; customs, aspirations and attitudes.&#13;
Baseline data is often only partially available, though many countries will have a large part of these&#13;
data and inexpensive field investigations can provide much of the remainder. Where more detailed&#13;
information is required (if significant effects on an important natural or cultural resource are&#13;
anticipated, for example) there will often be studies on local areas done by international agencies.&#13;
There may also be unpublished informatiop in govemment departments, universities, PhD theses, or&#13;
voluntary groups. These should be investigated and used where relevant, provided that the sources,&#13;
and any assumptions or uncertainties in the data are documented.&#13;
Environmental        A prediction of the changes in the environment resulting from project construction and operation are&#13;
Impacts:            to be considered, and an assessment of the effect on the surrounding physical, biological, and human&#13;
systems, should be presented. The assessment should pay particular attention to:&#13;
* the extent to which receiving water quality standards and/or other beneficial use objectives will be&#13;
achieved with the proposed type and level of treatment.&#13;
* The length of stream or expanse of lake or marine waters which will be positively or negatively&#13;
affected by the discharge, and the magnitude of the changes in water quality parameters.&#13;
* Projected quantitative changes in beneficial uses, such as fisheries (species composition,&#13;
productivity), recreation and tourism (visitor-days, overnights, expenditures), and waters available&#13;
for portable supply, irrigation, and industrial use.&#13;
* Sanitation and public benefits anticipated.&#13;
* Wastewater re-use for agriculture&#13;

Environmental        This section should include details of the management initiatives to be implemented during both the&#13;
Management Plan      construction and operational phases of the project. The EMP will need to account for monitoring of&#13;
environmental parameters and the influence of mitigation measures on environmental impacts. It&#13;
should include the following basic components.&#13;
Institutional Component&#13;
*   Institutional responsibilities for management of the water supply and sanitation sector&#13;
*   Responsibilities for monitoring, reporting and enforcement&#13;
*   Identification of any needs for capacity building, training or equipment&#13;

Management Plan      Environmental Monitoring Component&#13;
contiu ed...         Monitoring should ascertain compliance with agreed standards of potable water supply and/or effluent&#13;
continued...         discharge, and serve as an analytical support tool for achieving optimal operational performance. The&#13;
World Bank's General Environmental Guidelines, which would apply to projects of this type, are&#13;
provided in Annex III. A listing of typical monitoring parameters and frequencies for a wastewater&#13;
treatment plant are presented in Table 1. 7.2 to provide a general picture. Monitoring parameters and&#13;
frequencies for an actual situation are dependent on numerous factors including treatment&#13;
technologies, quality of influent, etc and should be determined on a case by case basis. Monitoring&#13;
parameters and frequencies for potable water are not provided herein due to similar complexities. The&#13;
reader is referred to the World Health Organization's Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality (1996)&#13;
for further information.&#13;
In cases where the wastewater is to be re-used for irrigation agriculture, the WHO's Health guidelines&#13;
for the use of wastewater in agriculture and aquaculture (Technical Report Series No. 778, 1989) are&#13;
recommended for monitoring parameters and guidelines.&#13;

            The Iraq Emergency Baghdad Water Supply
            and Sanitation Project aims to assist in restoring basic
            water supply and sanitation services for the capital city of
            Baghdad. There are eight project components. Component 1
            rehabilitates chlorine and chemical units at al-Karkh water
            treatment plant. Component 2 rehabilitates a 2B pumping
            station in Shark Dijla water treatment plant. Component 3
            extends and rehabilitates al-Rasheed water treatment plant.
            Component 4 rehabilitates the Abu Nawas raw water pumping
            station. Component 5 rehabilitates and renews the Sadr City
            sewerage network. Component 6 rehabilitates and renews the
            drinking water network in Za'afarania. Component 7
            provides technical assistance and capacity building
            including consulting services, system design and
            implementation, audits, feasibility studies, office
            equipment and operational costs. Component 8 develops a
            comprehensive city development plan for Baghdad.
