ROAD TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:              Republic of Togo&#13;
Beneficiary:           Ministry of Mines, Equipment, Transport, Posts and&#13;
Telecommunications (MMETPT).&#13;
Implementing Agencies  Direction Gen6rale des Travaux Publics (DGTP)&#13;
Direction Generale des Transports (DGT)&#13;
Poverty:               The project does not include specific targeted interventions to&#13;
reduce poverty. It will contribute to poverty alleviation by&#13;
reducing transport costs, resulting in higher farm-gate prices&#13;
for farmers, lower expenses for transport operators, and lower&#13;
prices for consumers of rural produce and manufactured&#13;
goods. The project will improve access to social services and&#13;
markets, especially in rural areas. The project will also&#13;
stimulate the private sector and create employment by&#13;
providing opportunities for small and medium enterprises&#13;
(SMEs) in road rehabilitation and maintenance.&#13;
Credit Amount:         SDR 36.0 million (US$ 50 million)&#13;
Terms:                 Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Commitment fee:        Standard IDA commitment fee&#13;
Project Description:   The Government of Togo (GOT) has identified road&#13;
maintenance as the major priority within the ten-year&#13;
program for the transport sector. Road maintenance would&#13;
cost about 109 billion CFA francs over the next six years.&#13;
The IDA Credit would address the most important priorities&#13;
of the government through the following components:&#13;
(a) National Road rehabilitation and maintenance:&#13;
US$ 48.6 million, of which US$ 24.6 million are for&#13;
rehabilitation, US$ 19.4 million are for periodic maintenance,&#13;
and US$ 3.6 million are for toll both construction, studies&#13;
and follow-up; (b) Institutional strengthening for road sector&#13;
management: US$ 3.6 million, consisting of short-term&#13;
technical assistance, training and equipment; (c) Road safety:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
US$ 1.0 million, of which US$ 700,000 are for the&#13;
construction and equipment of a vehicle inspection center,&#13;
and US$ 300,000 are for institutional strengthening in this&#13;
domain; and (d) Rehabilitation and management of rural&#13;
roads: US$ 1.6 million, of which US$ 1.0 million is for&#13;
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance works, and&#13;
US$ 630,000 are to strengthen rural road management and&#13;
support rural communities to foster their involvement in&#13;
managing feeder roads. The local contribution will amount&#13;
US$ 4.8 million from the Government (US$ 3.7 million), the&#13;
Road Maintenance Fund (US$ 1.0 million) and beneficiaries&#13;
(US$ 0.1 million).&#13;
Financing plan:       IDA          US$ 50 million&#13;
GOT         US$ 4.7 million, of which US$ 1.0 million&#13;
will be provided through the Road&#13;
Maintenance Fund&#13;
Beneficiaries  US$ 0.1 million estimated local, in-kind&#13;
contributions&#13;
Net Present Value:    CFAF 500 billion for the National Road rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance component&#13;
Benefits:             All road improvements will reduce transport time and vehicle&#13;
operating costs, leading to a reduction in overall transport&#13;
costs. Reduction of transport costs will lower the cost of&#13;
transported goods, encouraging agricultural production and&#13;
trade. Reduction of transport costs will likewise lower&#13;
passenger fares, encouraging mobility. Other, non-quantified&#13;
benefits are expected to flow from IDA-supported activities&#13;
that improve management and planning. Effective use of the&#13;
priority program as an investment tool should result in higher&#13;
rates of return on investments in the transport sector as a&#13;
whole. Development of a community-based, demand-driven&#13;
rural roads maintenance strategy will lead to more effective&#13;
use of resources. Better planning and contract management,&#13;
based on improved road data, will enable maintenance of&#13;
more roads with the same budget. Improvements in road&#13;
safety will reduce the cost of traffic accidents in terms of&#13;
human life and productivity, and damage to vehicles.&#13;
Risks:                The project is part of a sectoral reform effort, therefore the&#13;
main risks to IDA-supported components relate to new and&#13;
innovative activities. These are: (a) inadequate&#13;
replenishment of the Road Maintenance Fund. The RMF&#13;
resources are directly collected and transferred by an&#13;
independent oil company ensuring independence from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
general budget; (b) uncertainty of community participation&#13;
in feeder road management. The Project will support&#13;
community mobilization through local NGOs already&#13;
involved in rural infrastructure management; (c) insufficient&#13;
local SME technical capacity, including the risk of long&#13;
delays in works execution. Targeted training and technical&#13;
assistance to local SMEs will be provided along with on-site&#13;
support and supervision; and (d) lack of donor coordination.&#13;
To overcome this risk, annual sector review and biannual&#13;
donors' meeting will be organized by the GOT to coordinate&#13;
interventions and raise additional funds for the priority&#13;
program. Another minor risk concerns transformation of&#13;
sector institutions. Institutional restructuring is already well&#13;
advanced and most important reorganization will take place&#13;
prior to Credit effectiveness; support from the project will&#13;
consolidate this restructuring.&#13;

1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   Recognizing the importance of transport to national economic growth, the&#13;
Government of Togo (GOT) has developed a Transport Sector Strategy (TSS) with the&#13;
active participation of sector stakeholders and donors. This strategy, adopted in May&#13;
1996, is to be operationalized under the Government's ten-year Transport Sector&#13;
Investment Program (TSIP) from 1997 to 2006. The TSIP comprises investments and&#13;
institutional and policy reforms designed to support implementation of strategy objectives&#13;
to rehabilitate road infrastructure, establish an effective road maintenance system and&#13;
modernize the sector's institutional environment. The GOT has requested IDA assistance&#13;
in financing the first, priority tranche of this program, aimed at improving the condition&#13;
of transport infrastructure, and assuring sound management and sustainable autonomous&#13;
development of the transport sector, with the active participation of the private sector and&#13;
local communities.&#13;
1.2   Road transport carries 98 percent of demand for transport services, using a&#13;
severely degraded road network. The priority program and the proposed IDA Credit&#13;
project therefore focus primarily on the road subsector, through rehabilitation of&#13;
infrastructure and establishment of a sustainable maintenance system. The priority&#13;
program and proposed IDA Credit also support institutional strengthening for the&#13;
transport sector as a whole.&#13;
B. MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
1.3   Located on the Gulf of Guinea in Western Africa. Togo is a low-income country&#13;
with a population of approximately 4 million and a 1994 per capita Gross Domestic&#13;
Product (GDP) of US$ 390. Urban populations are growing at 6.5 percent per year,&#13;
double the national average growth rate of 3.1 percent. Despite this high urban growth&#13;
rate, it is expected that half of the country's population will still be living in rural areas by&#13;
2010, down from a 1993 level of 72 percent, maintaining the pressure on already fragile&#13;
rural infrastructure.&#13;
1.4   The economy is based on three main areas of activity: agriculture, services and&#13;
phosphate mining and export. Agriculture employs 75 percent of the active population,&#13;
and accounts for 38 percent of GDP. The service sector, mainly commerce and transit&#13;
activities, currently accounts for 36 percent of GDP. Phosphates make up 41 percent of&#13;
exports. Transport, supporting these main engines of growth, is therefore central to the&#13;
economy. Togo is one of the corridors to the Sahel (the Togolese corridor), in particular&#13;
to Burkina Faso (to which it channels 31 percent of its overseas imports), and to a lesser&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
extent to Niger, Mali, northern Ghana and northern Benin. The main transport&#13;
infrastructure consists of a network of more than 3,000 km of major national roads, 276&#13;
km of operating rail lines and a deep water port in Lome.&#13;
1.5   Until the early 1990's, Togo was known for its political stability and strong&#13;
economic growth. The political crisis of 1991-1993 resulted in a severe depression, from&#13;
which the Togolese economy is just beginning to recover. The 1994 CFA Franc (CFAF)&#13;
devaluation resulted in a 8.3 percent growth in GDP by 1995. However, 1995 GDP&#13;
(217.2 billion in 1978 CFAF) still lags nearly 4 percent behind that of 1989 (225.3 billion&#13;
in 1978 CFAF). Public finances have likewise improved somewhat since the crisis: the&#13;
net deficit has dropped from a 1993post-crisis high of 15.3 percent of GDP to 8.4 percent&#13;
in 1995, due to a combination of increased revenues and more contained State&#13;
expenditures. Arrears payments have dropped to CFAF 77.8 billion on a total estimated,&#13;
on December 31, 1994, at CFAF 108.9 billion, due to external debt forgiveness and&#13;
rescheduling.&#13;
1.6   To promote sustainable economic growth, the GOT has engaged in a new&#13;
development strategy, supported by the IDA Economic Recovery Adjustment Credit&#13;
(ERAC) for the period 1996-1998. In line with the Bank's 1995 Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) for Togo, ERAC's main objectives are to correct economic imbalances&#13;
and to facilitate growth in equity. These objectives translate into sectoral measures to: (a)&#13;
diversify agricultural production and exportation in which Togo has a comparative&#13;
advantage in external markets; (b) regenerate the manufacturing sector through small and&#13;
medium enterprises (SMEs) and private investment; (c) revive the service sector, in&#13;
which Togolese economic agents have been successful in the past; (d) create an enabling&#13;
environment to transform Lome into a regional trade and financial center; and (e) reduce&#13;
State expenditures, particularly those that are not directly productive, and increase&#13;
budgetary resource mobilization.&#13;
1.7   ERAC refocuses public expenditures to give priority to health, education, and the&#13;
rehabilitation of basic economic and social infrastructure, such as roads, water and&#13;
sanitation. Over the short term, the emphasis will be on the rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of infrastructure using labor-intensive techniques to promote employment.&#13;
The Transport Sector Strategy and the TSIP reflect these same priorities and focus on&#13;
improving and maintaining the existing road infrastructure as a means of providing Togo&#13;
with a competitive transport network. Restored transport competitiveness will enable the&#13;
country to resume its significant role in regional trade, promote agricultural production,&#13;
and reduce rural poverty.&#13;
C. DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS AND BROAD OBJECTIVES&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy Linkages&#13;
1.8   The Bank's CAS for Togo promotes sustainable, private-sector led growth and&#13;
poverty reduction. To achieve these objectives, Bank assistance takes a two-pronged&#13;
approach, supporting: (a) Government efforts to mobilize and allocate resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
effectively, and reform public enterprises; and (b) broad policy reforms and targeted&#13;
investments to enhance participation in economic growth, especially by the poor, create a&#13;
favorable environment for private sector development, and increase the efficiency and&#13;
sustainability of natural resource management. Over the short-term, Bank assistance&#13;
focuses on rehabilitating essential transport and energy infrastructure, and restoring&#13;
social services, which suffered during the political crisis. In its current state, this&#13;
infrastructure significantly reduces the development potential of the country. Throughout&#13;
the assistance strategy, planned operations will emphasize strengthening public sector&#13;
management of infrastructure and services.&#13;
1.9   The CAS identifies degraded physical infrastructure as a major constraint to&#13;
development. Given the importance of transport to the national economy, and to regional&#13;
development, the CAS places primary importance on rehabilitating Togo's transport&#13;
infrastructure, improving sector management and service provision, and assuring the&#13;
sector sustainability. Rehabilitation and sustainable management of the road subsector&#13;
are a first priority for revitalizing the economy. Improvements in road infrastructure,&#13;
services and management will revitalize the transit trade economy, boost agricultural&#13;
production, create jobs and increase accessibility to services, especially in rural areas.&#13;
1.10  Accordingly, the proposed project focuses on rehabilitating vital road networks,&#13;
improving their management, and ensuring their sustainability. This latter recognizes the&#13;
importance of continuous and adequate infrastructure maintenance. The project therefore&#13;
promotes establishment of an efficient road maintenance system, based on a clearly&#13;
defined sector strategy and prioritized works program, that includes: (a) creation of an&#13;
autonomous Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) to mobilize resources for continuous&#13;
maintenance financing; (b) reorganization of road maintenance institutions to facilitate&#13;
involvement of the private sector and communities in infrastructure maintenance works;&#13;
and (c) streamlined, transparent procurement and management procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. TRANSPORT IN TOGO&#13;
A. TRANSPORT SECTOR CONTEXT&#13;
2.1   The Togolese transport system is relatively well-developed, having evolved&#13;
through strategic investment choices over the past 20 years. With adequate maintenance,&#13;
this system has the capacity to respond to Togo's medium-term development needs.&#13;
Road infrastructure consists of a dense road network (0.13 km/kM2), 9,600 km in length,&#13;
of which 1,608 km are paved, 1,461 km are earth roads, and 4,500 km are improved rural&#13;
tracks. The remainder consists of ordinary rural tracks. The principal axis,&#13;
accommodating more than 50 percent of Togo's road traffic, is the international highway,&#13;
RN1, running north from Lome to the border with Burkina Faso. The second major axis&#13;
is the coastal road, linking Togo to Ghana and Benin. The rail network consists of 570&#13;
km of rail lines, of which only the 276 km line from Lome to Blitta is currently in use.&#13;
The port at Lome, operated by an autonomous agency, is an important regional facility&#13;
with large storage capacity and more than 800 meters of berth, able to accommodate up to&#13;
3 million tons a year; an open-sea wharf at Kpeme facilitates the export of phosphates.&#13;
Air transport infrastructure consists of an international airport at Lome, with a yearly&#13;
capacity of 700,000 travelers and 10,000 tons of freight, and 6 secondary national&#13;
airports, including the airport at Niamtougou, which is operational but lacks commercial&#13;
traffic.&#13;
2.2   Supply and Demand for Transport Services. Transport activities were&#13;
profoundly affected by the crisis. Road traffic demand, which had been growing at an&#13;
annual rate of 3 to 6 percent since 1980, dropped dramatically at the beginning of the&#13;
1990s to its lowest point since the beginning of the previous decade. The return to&#13;
relative political stability in 1994 sparked a sectoral recovery, consolidated in 1995.&#13;
However, it is unlikely that anticipated demand will lead to any real increased&#13;
infrastructure capacity until 2002. After two decades of steady growth, Lome's port&#13;
traffic fell from a 1990 high of 2 million tons to 1 million tons in 1993. Air traffic fell&#13;
from 414,000 passengers and 6,512 tons of goods in 1991 to 191,000 passengers and&#13;
3,200 tons in 1994. Rail traffic has been declining steadily since 1975: passenger traffic&#13;
had ceased entirely by 1996; freight traffic had fallen from 517,000 tons to 35,000 tons&#13;
by 1994.&#13;
2.3   Road transport supply is diversified and adequate. Liberalized in the early&#13;
eighties, road transport responds to more than 98 percent of the domestic demand for&#13;
transport of passengers and freight; the remainder goes by rail. In 1995, the national fleet&#13;
was estimated at 32,000 cars, vans and trucks. At least 75 percent of this fleet is&#13;
comprised of imported used vehicles, generally in poor condition. Interurban passenger&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
transport is provided by small-scale private operators operating some 1,100 minibuses&#13;
and jitneys. Freight transport services are provided by 3 private companies and by&#13;
multiple, small (one to two-truck), individual carriers. Estimates suggest that there may&#13;
be some 1,300 trucks in the fleet. Since the disappearance in the early 1980s of the&#13;
municipal bus company, urban and periurban passenger traffic has been provided by the&#13;
informal sector. Urban transport, mainly in Lome, is provided by small operators, driving&#13;
taxis, minivans, and motorcycle taxis. The motorcycle taxis, an inexpensive transport&#13;
mode, proliferated with the economic crisis, providing employment and easy access to&#13;
urban areas with poor infrastructure.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE SECTOR&#13;
2.4   Sector Importance to the Economy. For Togo, reliable and efficient transport&#13;
service is essential to the competitiveness of its main economic pillars: agriculture and&#13;
trade. In addition, Togo's geographic location is such that its transport system plays a&#13;
vital role in the development of regional transit trade, especially for the landlocked&#13;
countries of Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali, as well as the neighboring countries of Benin&#13;
and Ghana. This transit activity has an important impact on the Togolese economy.&#13;
2.5   Transport Sector Contribution to Economic Development. The most recent&#13;
estimate of the actual value-added of the transport sector to GDP dates back to 1990.&#13;
Extrapolation from this data gives a 1995 transport sector contribution to GDP of 5 to 6&#13;
percent. This figure only partially reflects the real contribution to the national economic&#13;
growth, as it does not capture the contributions of numerous small-scale or informal&#13;
transport operations (estimated at 74 percent of total value-added for the transport sector),&#13;
which are difficult to measure. The latest value-added figures by transport mode,&#13;
covering 1985-1990, show that: (a) transport as a whole contributed between 6.5 percent&#13;
and 7 percent to GDP, and that (b) the dominant contribution comes from road transport&#13;
(65 to 70 percent of the total value-added for the transport sector), followed by that of&#13;
maritime transport at (13 to 17 percent). Direct employment in the sector was estimated&#13;
in 1995 at the equivalent of 26,500 permanent jobs, mainly in the transport of goods and&#13;
passengers; 80 percent of this employment is in private sector. Hence the transport sector&#13;
is an important supplier of employment.&#13;
2.6   Road Sector Finance. Road taxes and charges contribute around 10 percent of&#13;
General Budget revenues. Sectoral resources come from four tax sources: (a) customs&#13;
and excise taxes on imported petroleum products (61 percent of sector tax revenue); (b)&#13;
import duties on vehicles and spare parts; (c) taxes on road carrier revenues; and (d)&#13;
excise and other taxes on some administrative services. Tax revenue fell sharply during&#13;
the 1991-93 crisis, from CFAF 9 billion in 1990 to about 2.8 billion in 1993. As in the&#13;
general economy, stability and the devaluation brought about a slight recovery in 1994,&#13;
with revenues of CFAF 5.4 billion. The trend was consolidated in 1995 with a return to&#13;
pre-crisis levels (CFAF 9.3 billion), which have continued to rise (over CFAF 10 billion&#13;
in 1996). Transport sector revenue is expected to be on the order of CFAF 15 billion in&#13;
1997 following the recent increase in oil prices. Despite these resources, Budget&#13;
allocations to road maintenance (approximately CFAF 1.2 billion) are insufficient to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
cover actual needs, estimated to average CFAF 3.0 billion for routine and periodic&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
C. SECTOR MANAGEMENT: PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS&#13;
The Public Sector&#13;
2.7   Transport Sector Management. Until recently, Togo's transport sector was&#13;
managed by multiple public sector institutions. As recommended in the TSS, a&#13;
government reshuffling in August 1996 brought most of these institutions under the&#13;
supervision of the Ministry of Mines, Equipment, Transport, Posts and&#13;
Telecommunications (MMETPT). The MMETPT, through its Secretariat d'Etat des&#13;
Transports (State Transport Secretariat) (SET) and subsectoral departments, exercises&#13;
State control functions (regulation, safety, sectoral policy, financial monitoring), and the&#13;
administrative supervision of the 4 public and parastatal companies. Its Direction&#13;
generale des Transports (DGT), formerly at the Ministere du Commerce des Transports&#13;
et des Prix (Ministry of Trade, Transport and Prices) (MCTP) is responsible for sector&#13;
policy design and implementation, regulates the system and supervises the government-&#13;
owned companies in each of the sub-sectors. Legal and financial supervision of public&#13;
and parastatal companies is the responsibility of the Ministere de l 'Industrie et des&#13;
Entreprises publiques (Ministry of Industry and Public Enterprises).&#13;
2.8   Road Infrastructure Management. Table 2.1 provides a break-down of the&#13;
areas of responsibility for Togo's road network. The national road infrastructure and&#13;
some of the rural routes are under the MMETPT's Direction generale des Travaux&#13;
Publics (General Directorate of Public Works) (DGTP). Management of the remaining&#13;
network of rural roads and tracks is theoretically divided among the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, Breeding and Fishing (MAEP), public agribusinesses (SOTOCO and&#13;
SAFICC), and the prefectures. The DGTP is responsible for planning and managing the&#13;
1,660 km of paved and 1,461 km of unpaved roads which make up the national road&#13;
network. In mid-1994, MMETPT became responsible for 943 km of improved rural&#13;
roads, formerly under MAEP. The major agribusinesses were charged with managing&#13;
road infrastructure serving the regions in which they operate: SOTOCO covered 2,040&#13;
km of earth roads in the cotton zone, while SAFICC covered 865 km of earth roads in the&#13;
coffee and cocoa producing regions. These companies are currently being restructured,&#13;
and rural infrastructure no longer falls under their jurisdiction. Around 1,154 km of rural&#13;
road constructed through donor-supported agricultural and rural service improvement&#13;
projects are not under the aegis of any formal or informal institution. The remainder of&#13;
the network, consisting of dirt tracks, is theoretically under the authority of the&#13;
prefectures, however these local authorities have neither the management capacity nor the&#13;
necessary resources to see to its maintenance.&#13;

2.9   The DGTP divides road network management among six central departments: (a)&#13;
Personnel and Training, (b) Road Network, with three functional divisions; (c) Building&#13;
and Construction; (d) Equipment Pool (DMTP); (e) Management and Accounting; and,&#13;
recently, (f) Rural Roads. At the local level, deconcentrated (line) departments in each of&#13;
the five regions are charged with maintaining roads and public structures, periodic traffic&#13;
counts, force-account works, supervising contracted works, routine maintenance, and&#13;
managing equipment consigned for public maintenance works. Each regional departmnent&#13;
covers three to five districts, which are responsible for works on sections of the network&#13;
within district jurisdiction (normnally between 120 to 250 km per district). In line with&#13;
TSS recommendations, the Feeder Roads Department (FRD) has been created within the&#13;
MMETPT, and incorporates the former Service des pistes rurales (Feeder Roads Service)&#13;
under MAEP to unify feeder road management. The FRD will be responsible for&#13;
developing and implementing a new rural road maintenance strategy based on community&#13;
participation and partnerships between local villages, government institutions and donors.&#13;
2. 10 Road Safety. SET, through the Direction ginirale des Transports (DGT), is now&#13;
responsible for road safety management including policy design and implementation.&#13;
Police and the gendarmerie are responsible for traffic control, but their intervention does&#13;
not address this basic objective and mainly results in extorting funds from drivers. Driver&#13;
training and examinations are poor. The only institution presently attempting to address&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
road safety is the Prevention Routiere togolaise (Togolese Road Safety Organization), a&#13;
private association with no permanent staff or official status, whose only source of&#13;
income is a once-yearly headlight inspection fee.&#13;
The Private Sector&#13;
2.11  Interurban transport. As noted earlier, interurban transport is provided by&#13;
numerous, small-scale, private operators. Ease of entry and liberalization of the activity&#13;
have encouraged a rapid increase in supply. The interurban rolling stock is quite old: in&#13;
1995, the fleet was 12 years old on average, with 20 percent of the stock over 15 years&#13;
old. The stock is replenished by imported used vehicles, a common regional&#13;
phenomenon. Two drivers unions for passenger transport (USYNDICTO and&#13;
SYLICONTO), and one freight transport union (UTRABO) play an important role in the&#13;
functioning of interurban travel services by managing all stations, supervising the orderly&#13;
rotation of vehicle loading, collecting fares for drivers, and regulating the various&#13;
mandatory taxes. The unions also manage a solidarity fund of drivers' contributions as a&#13;
service to members.&#13;
2.12 Urban transport. Urban transport is similarly provided by numerous small-&#13;
scale, individual operators, the majority of which operate in the informal sector. The fleet&#13;
of taxis and minibuses is old and in bad condition. Less than 30 percent of the vehicles&#13;
are insured. Private sector operators enjoy free access to the road transport profession&#13;
and a conducive regulatory framework, but suffer from an excess of supply and extortion&#13;
by police at multiple checkpoints.&#13;
2.13  Local Public Works Sector. Experience with contracting out routine&#13;
maintenance to local small and medium enterprises (SMEs) shows promise in promoting&#13;
productivity. The 1993 IDA-funded Transport Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1861-TO),&#13;
promoted contracting out small repairs (patching, masonry, road repair) to SMEs. The&#13;
European Development Fund (EDF) has also funded several routine maintenance&#13;
operations through local SME contracting. In 1994-95, taking advantage of a&#13;
restructuring in the Transport Rehabilitation Project, approximately 80 contracts for&#13;
routine maintenance (patching, drainage system repair and cleaning, repaving, road&#13;
shoulder repair) were awarded to some 30 SMEs. Despite structural weaknesses caused&#13;
by inactivity during the 1991-93 political crisis, the SMEs proved effective in providing&#13;
road maintenance. Further support would improve the management capacity of these&#13;
SMEs, and enable them to carry out future works more efficiently.&#13;
2.14 Associations and Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs). Togolese society&#13;
is characterized by deep traditions of association and community, especially in rural&#13;
areas, centered on the institution of "village chiefdoms." Since independence, new types&#13;
of local social organization have emerged to promote local development, supported by&#13;
larger domestic and international institutions. Today there are over 2,500 formal and&#13;
informal associations of different types (NGOs, cooperatives, local associations)&#13;
throughout the country involved in a variety of sectors, such as health, literacy,&#13;
agricultural production and marketing, and rural infrastructure (mainly water and roads).&#13;
The most wide-spread of these new organizations are some 1,500 village development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
committees, supported by the Ministry of Social Affairs, which organize village&#13;
participation in local development activities. The 381 village agricultural groups,&#13;
supported by the major agribusinesses (SOTOCO and SAFICC), organize and develop&#13;
agricultural production in the agricultural export-producing zones. Other community&#13;
organizations have developed since the end of the 1980s through international NGO&#13;
development projects. By 1995, there were at least 20 local, and 5 international NGOs&#13;
involved in rural infrastructure projects (water supply and feeder road management)&#13;
throughout the country. This network of community associations suffers from a lack of&#13;
material resources, of coordination with traditional institutions, and competence in&#13;
specific areas of intervention. Despite these difficulties, the network of associations in&#13;
Togo provides a strong foundation on which to build community participation in local&#13;
development.&#13;
D. LESSONS LEARNED FROM INVOLVEMENT OF THE WORLD BANK&#13;
GROUP AND OTHER DONORS IN THE TOGOLESE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
Donor Involvement&#13;
2.15  The EDF and IDA are the major active donors in the transport sector. Other&#13;
donors have provided significant assistance in the past: German Cooperation (KFW) in&#13;
the development of the Port of Lome, the French Development Fund (CFD) in rural roads&#13;
and airport infrastructure, and FIDA along with the United Nations Development&#13;
Program in feeder road infrastructure. The African Development Bank (AfDB) has&#13;
assisted Togo in paving and rehabilitating part of the national road network. Apart from&#13;
IDA, EDF remains the major contributor to transport sector development through projects&#13;
of road paving, construction of new feeder roads in cocoa and cotton-producing zones&#13;
and routine and periodic maintenance of the national road network. EDF also supported&#13;
development of the private construction sector in its last national road maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation operation (1990-1992). Donor assistance to Togo was interrupted by the&#13;
1991-93 political crisis, and is only beginning to resume, led by IDA in 1993, and shortly&#13;
to be followed by AfDB. Other donors are willing to resume financing once Togo has&#13;
complied with their political and institutional conditions.&#13;
Past IDA Involvement&#13;
2.16 IDA has been associated with Togo's transport sector since 1968, and has led&#13;
active donor assistance to the sector. It has financed seven sector projects, with a&#13;
combined credit of US$ 133 million, of which six have been concluded and one is&#13;
nearing completion. IDA has focused its lending on roads, as the most important of the&#13;
country's transport infrastructure, but has also supported a rail operation. Of IDA's&#13;
support to the road sector, five projects have dealt primarily with national roads, one&#13;
project focused on feeder roads and one project addressed both. Taken together, the IDA&#13;
projects constitute a significant and prolonged effort which has achieved some, though&#13;
not fully satisfactory, results. Despite major achievements, inadequate road maintenance&#13;
has remained the leading sector issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
2.17 The soon-to-be-completed Transport Rehabilitation Project (CR. 1861-TO) aimed&#13;
at achieving major sectoral reforms to facilitate private sector involvement in road&#13;
maintenance, develop public sector management capacity, improve road safety and secure&#13;
road maintenance funding. However, project implementation was severely hampered by&#13;
the political and economic crises of the early 1 990s. The project was restructured in 1994&#13;
to focus on priority maintenance for the national network and on rebuilding road network&#13;
administration capacity.&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
2.18 Six major lessons flow from IDA project experience in Togo's transport sector:&#13;
(a) Current arrangements for road maintenance financing are inadequate.&#13;
Resources for road maintenance financing are allocated in the National General Budget&#13;
by the Treasurer. Although the funding exists on paper, it has never been provided in full&#13;
or on time, even during periods of fiscal soundness. Adequate road maintenance&#13;
financing could be ensured by an independently financed, autonomous fund, governed by&#13;
road user representatives and other sector stakeholders.&#13;
(b) The force account has proven to be seriously ineffective in carrying out&#13;
maintenance of road networks, despite support and supervision efforts. Force account&#13;
labor is oversupplied, underskilled and poorly supervised, resulting in low productivity.&#13;
New equipment deteriorates quickly due to poor maintenance, and inappropriate use.&#13;
Maintenance works should be contracted out to take advantage of competition and wider&#13;
skills.&#13;
(c) Administrative obstacles and excessive control by high level bureaucrats are&#13;
stifling sector institutions, and prevent them from developing adequate competencies&#13;
and responding to sector needs. Cumbersome procedures, especially in procurement, a&#13;
top-heavy hierarchy, and lack of resources have discouraged initiative and destroyed&#13;
capacity-building efforts in previous operations. Procurement procedures should be&#13;
revised and simplified, and institutions should be restructured to facilitate accountability&#13;
and individual initiative.&#13;
(d) Entrenched long-term technical assistance (TA) and untargeted training have&#13;
proven ineffective. TA should be short-term and focused on beneficiary needs.&#13;
Likewise training should correspond to beneficiary-identified needs, and be provided on&#13;
site, whenever possible, by qualified trainers.&#13;
(e) Current public sector institutional arrangements lack necessary resources and&#13;
capacity to manage the dispersed feeder road network. Community participation and&#13;
partnerships between the State, the community and donors would spread the burden for&#13;
network maintenance and management, and allow each institution to focus its efforts and&#13;
resources more effectively.&#13;
(f) Donor coordination is critical to sustain sector reforms. Past sector gains from&#13;
donor projects have remained unconsolidated due, in part, to lack of coordination. The&#13;
Transport Sector Strategy provides a coherent framework for future interventions, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
TSIP defines clear priorities to guide donor assistance. Regular meetings should be held&#13;
between the Government and donors to follow up TSS and TSIP implementation.&#13;
E. TRANSPORT SECTOR ISSUES AND STRATEGY&#13;
The 1995 Transport Sector Strategy&#13;
2.19 A Participatory Process. Within the framework of its economic revitalization&#13;
program, the Government of Togo identified the need to define a transport sector&#13;
development strategy to reestablish sectoral efficacy and allow it to play its role in&#13;
restoring national economic competitiveness. The Transport Sector Strategy was&#13;
developed through intensive stakeholder participation and consultation, and consisted of&#13;
the following principle steps: (a) analysis of sectoral issues and identification of&#13;
priorities and strategic directions; (b) Government discussions of analysis results with&#13;
public and private stakeholders (including local sectoral professional organizations),&#13;
World Bank missions, and other donors; and (c) a three-day national seminar at the end of&#13;
November 1995 organized by the Togolese authorities to discuss and widen consensus on&#13;
the strategic recommendations resulting from this process. The seminar facilitated&#13;
discussion and issue resolution among the widest possible arena of sector stakeholders,&#13;
including the private sector, professional organizations, and formal and informal groups&#13;
of transport service users, in addition to public sector entities and donors.&#13;
2.20  Infrastructure maintenance is the priority. The TSS concludes that&#13;
maintenance and better use of existing investments take priority over new investments.&#13;
This conclusion translates into two fundamental sector priorities: (a) to rehabilitate road&#13;
infrastructure, and establish an effective maintenance system; and (b) to modernize the&#13;
institutional environment to make best use of the comparative advantages of the public&#13;
and private sectors. Road infrastructure is singled out for particular emphasis because,&#13;
while port and airport infrastructure and services are financially self-reliant and provide&#13;
adequate service to their users, road infrastructure has fallen into critical condition due to&#13;
lack of maintenance, leading to a continuously declining level of service and increasing&#13;
transport costs.&#13;
2.21  Within the framework of this strategy, the GOT has defined the following&#13;
concrete measures in the TSIP to achieve the priorities set above: (a) initiate a road&#13;
network rehabilitation and maintenance program, meeting economic and financial&#13;
criteria, that includes: (i) establishment of an autonomous Road Maintenance Fund to&#13;
ensure adequate and regular maintenance financing, (ii) encouragement of, and eventual&#13;
full reliance on the private sector to carry out road maintenance, and (iii) standardized&#13;
management of rural roads, and participation of rural communities in maintenance works;&#13;
and (b) strengthen the institutional framework and improve administrative capacity to&#13;
manage and plan the sector, including road safety.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Road Infrastructure Management: Issues and Strategy&#13;
Issues&#13;
2.22 A well structured road network that could, if adequately maintained, easily&#13;
meet mid-term demand. The Togolese road network consists of the national network and&#13;
the rural road network (see Table 2.1). The national network is formed by a set of north-&#13;
south radial highways, centered on Lome, which cross a set of east-west roads. The&#13;
network includes roads linking prefectures and international highways, the most important&#13;
of which is RN 1, linking Lome to the Burkina Faso and Niger borders (Cinkasse) in the&#13;
north. RN1 is complemented by a coastal road crossing from Ghana to Cotonou. The&#13;
network of radial roads is relatively well developed and most of it is paved.&#13;
2.23  Of Togo's 8,000 to 9,000 km of road, 3,133 km are national roads and 5,000 to&#13;
6,000 km are rural roads. About 54 percent of the national network is paved; the remainder&#13;
consists of gravel or earth roads. The rural road network encompasses rural roads that have&#13;
been upgraded under a variety of social and agricultural projects, and rural paths that have&#13;
never been improved.&#13;
2.24 A road network in critical condition. The 1990-93 political turmoil and resultant&#13;
fiscal crisis have taken a heavy toll on road infrastructure. Over the last six years,&#13;
disorganized public administrationand lack of government finance has limited road&#13;
maintenance solely to curative operations on the most damaged routes (those in danger of&#13;
complete closure), financed by foreign assistance. The total lack of periodic or even routine&#13;
maintenance over the last six years has resulted in increasing degradation of all routes. A&#13;
network inspection conducted in late 1995 showed that 63 percent of the paved and 80&#13;
percent of the unpaved national network are in a bad to fair condition. Road degradation&#13;
was aggravated by: (a) the suspension of external aid, which had been nearly the sole source&#13;
of periodic maintenance financing; (b) an already aging network, 50 percent of which is an&#13;
average of 15 years old; and (c) inadequate technical design of at least 50 percent of paved&#13;
roads, making them extremely sensitive to the lack of maintenance. The national earth road&#13;
network is now also in poor condition, but the effects of inadequate maintenance have been&#13;
mitigated somewhat by a decline in traffic during the crisis. The most vulnerable sections&#13;
of this network must be rehabilitated soon if interruptions in traffic flow, particularly during&#13;
rainy seasons, are to be prevented in the years to come.&#13;
2.25 Weak road management capacity, an ill-adapted maintenance policy,&#13;
inefficient force-account operations and insufficient financing of road maintenance&#13;
The DGTP is adequately organized, but suffers from a lack of staff management, absence of&#13;
a training policy and lack of professionals qualified in the areas of road maintenance,&#13;
planning and works supervision. The maintenance policy, subject to the vagaries of foreign&#13;
aid, is ill-adapted and costly, giving priority to heavy rehabilitation works at the expense of&#13;
regular routine and periodic maintenance. This policy is revealed in distribution of&#13;
maintenance expenditures over the last ten years: 2 percent for periodic maintenance, 20&#13;
percent for routine maintenance and 78 percent for rehabilitationworks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
2.26 Routine maintenance, when performed, is executed by DGTP through its&#13;
decentralized force account. Although force-account brigades have abundant staffand&#13;
equipment, they have low productivityand lack flexibility. Force-accountinefficiency&#13;
stems from: (a) insufficient budget resources; (b) slow commitment and disbursement&#13;
procedures, limiting the actual amount of disposable resources; (c) inadequate supervision&#13;
and monitoring, compounded by poor programming; and (d) ill-adapted administrative&#13;
procedures, especially in procurement. DGTP management of public works equipment is&#13;
deficient. As a result, the fleet (262 vehicles) is deteriorating and less than 40 percent is&#13;
currently available for use. There is virtually no control of equipment use.&#13;
2.27 Local SME development, which could increase the country's road maintenance&#13;
capacity, is severely constrained by lengthy contracting and payment procedures for public&#13;
procurement and the lack of a stable, sustainable market. These factors destroy any&#13;
incentive for SMEs to invest in developing human or material capital.&#13;
2.28  Maintenanceprogramming, currently limitedto curative maintenance, is overly&#13;
simplistic and inefficient. Data necessary for effective maintenance programming, such as&#13;
condition of network, past maintenance, traffic counts, network inspections, are virtually&#13;
non-existent. The network has deteriorated to the point that programming must focus on&#13;
emergency maintenance, with limited prioritization. Investment programming seems to be&#13;
largely ad hoc, especially for rehabilitationworks, with no economicjustification.&#13;
2.29 Government budget allocations for road maintenance are inadequate and irregular&#13;
(around CFAF 1.2 billion, whereas annual maintenance requirements reach CFAF 3.0&#13;
billion). Untimely release of funds delays commitment and disbursement. Budget&#13;
utilization is hampered by burdensome paperwork procedures imposed by the Treasury. In&#13;
addition, a substantial part of the allocated budget covers the fixed operating costs of the&#13;
DGTP, thus limiting the amount actually available for maintenance works.&#13;
2.30  In addition to the issues described above, the rural road network suffers from&#13;
multiple interventions with no coordination. Rural network management is supposedly&#13;
distributed among a number of agencies, as shown in Table 2.1. Much of this network&#13;
either falls betweenjurisdictions, or suffers from weak institutional management capacity.&#13;
In 1994 the MMETPT, through the DGTP, assumed responsibility for management of 943&#13;
km of rural roads previously under control of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural&#13;
Development. Agribusiness companies (SOTOCO and SAFICC) also are theoretically in&#13;
charge of the rural track network serving their production area, though most of the network&#13;
is not identified. SOTOCO has occasionally undertaken road maintenance works with CFD&#13;
support; otherwise neither company has invested in road maintenance. Investment&#13;
decisions largely depend on the availability of foreign financing with no coordination&#13;
among Togolese institutions and donors, which often leads to these resources being wasted.&#13;
Most of the improved rural tracks were built without providing resources or determining&#13;
responsibility for their future maintenance. Construction standards for some tracks are too&#13;
high for the role they are expected to play and the actual traffic they handle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Government strategy&#13;
2.31  Road infrastructure management is the most important government activity in the&#13;
transport sector. As delineated in the national TS S, the government intends to establish an&#13;
efficient infrastructure management system to attain the following strategic objectives: (a)&#13;
reduce transport costs; (b) safeguard infrastructure investments to provide adequate service&#13;
to the economy; (c) alleviate poverty by opening up remote rural zones and poorly serviced&#13;
urban areas; and (d) reinforce the competitiveness of the Togo transit corridor. To achieve&#13;
these objectives the strategy adopted by the GOT consists of the following measures.&#13;
2.32 Appropriate Public Sector Role. The role of the public sector is redefined and its&#13;
management and planning capacity will be reinforced. The DGTP will reorganize and&#13;
disengage from force-account works, focusing instead on maintenance programming and&#13;
supervision. Its force account will be redeployed as individual contractors to provide&#13;
manual routine maintenance. The public equipment pool is to be transformed into a&#13;
cornmercial equipment-leasingentity serving public and private operators. Prior to&#13;
negotiations, the GOT established the Equipment Leasing Company. During&#13;
negotiations, the GOT agreed to take all action necessary or appropriate on its part&#13;
to privatize progressively the Equipment Leasing Company. Finally, DGTP's&#13;
management capacity will be improved through: (a) creation of a procurement and contract&#13;
management unit; and (b) reactivation of its personnel management administrationby&#13;
appointing more qualified professional and supervisory staff, instituting an adequate&#13;
training program, and establishing a road data system to facilitate road network&#13;
management. Initial redeployment of DGTP's labor force took place prior to appraisal of&#13;
the proposed project, and routine manual maintenance is now being performed. Prior to&#13;
negotiations, the GOT completed the first phase of the redeployment. The GOT&#13;
agreed during negotiations that further redeployment of the labor force&#13;
(privatization) is to be carried out in the course of the first two years of project&#13;
implementation. In addition, agreementhas been reached on DGTP reorganization,&#13;
including establishment of a Contract Management Unit and redefinition of line&#13;
departments.&#13;
2.33  Private sector development Building on the positive experience of maintenance&#13;
by local contractors, the GOT is resolved to involve the private sector in road maintenance&#13;
and will contract out routine and periodic maintenance works. The following measures will&#13;
be taken to facilitate this participation and promote private sector development: (a) adapt&#13;
bid packages to the capacity of local civil works industry for routine and small-scale&#13;
periodic maintenance; (b) simplify procurement procedures and devolve maintenance&#13;
procurement authority to MMETPT; (c) reduce delays in contractor payment through&#13;
adequate and regular maintenance financing, with streamlined management (see paragraph&#13;
2.34); and (d) provide technical assistance to SMEs to develop their management capacity&#13;
and improve their productivity. The MMETPT has been vested with procurement authority&#13;
for maintenance works prior to project appraisal. The GOT agreed during negotiations&#13;
on the use of bank standard bid documents for procurement of works, goods and&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
2.34 Road maintenance financing. Secure regular and adequate financing for road&#13;
maintenance by establishing an autonomous Road Maintenance Fund. The RMF will be&#13;
funded directly through road user fees based on gasoline consumption and road tolls. The&#13;
RMF will finance only contracted-outmaintenance works and will be autonomously&#13;
managed to assure timely disbursements and payments to contractors. Revenue destined for&#13;
the RMF is to be collected by a parastatal oil company and deposited in a RMF account to&#13;
be established in the Banque Centrale des Etats de l 'Afrique de l 'ouest. Legislation to&#13;
establish the RMF has been adopted and will shortly be enacted. The Ministry of Finance&#13;
(MOF) has issued a bylaw to provide adequate arrangements for collection of road user&#13;
charges allocated to the RMF. Prior to negotiations, the GOT established the RMF,&#13;
adopted the 1997 road maintenance program and budget and launched the first&#13;
RMF-funded bidding invitations for routine maintenance works on the national&#13;
network&#13;
2.35  Priority maintenance program. The newly designed rehabilitationand&#13;
maintenance strategy for the road network elaborates a priority program to guide public&#13;
expenditure programming over the next ten years. This program is designed to reflect&#13;
appropriate, needs-based maintenance techniques and standards and expected economic&#13;
returns on investments. It is also designed to be adaptable to different financing scenarios.&#13;
Priority will be given to expenditures that safeguard road infrastructure capital to: (a)&#13;
reduce transport costs by maintaining the network in an acceptably functioning condition;&#13;
(b) guarantee the accessibility of agricultural production zones, and (c) consolidate the&#13;
competitiveness of the transit corridor. Given the critical condition of the network, the GOT&#13;
will have to mobilize around CFAF 109 billion over the next six years to finance the&#13;
prioritymaintenanceprogram. The GOT should secure donorparticipationin financingthe&#13;
priority program. The GOT confirmed during negotiations that the priority&#13;
maintenance program will be updated annually by the DGTP and submitted for&#13;
IDA and donor review prior to its adoption by the RMF's board, the Road Council.&#13;
2.36  Rural networkmanagement. The GOT is determinedto set up an adequate&#13;
management system for the rural network to ensure an acceptable level of service capable of&#13;
supporting social and economic activities in rural areas. Given limited State resources, the&#13;
new system features a partnership between Government institutions and local communities&#13;
based on clear distribution of responsibilitiesand mutual commitments, especially for&#13;
network maintenance. A National Coordination Committee for Rural Roads (NCCRR),&#13;
with broad representation, will be established to coordinate investment and periodic&#13;
maintenance interventions to ensure that priorities are respected and that resources are not&#13;
wasted. The feeder road department (FRD), transferred from the MAEP, will be integrated&#13;
into the DGTP and become a permanent technical secretariat of the NCCRR. The&#13;
restructured FRD will assure management of the data base, coordination of the priority&#13;
maintenance program, and design of the government strategy for feeder roads, as well as&#13;
support to local community participation development efforts. A Rural Road Management&#13;
Manual will be developed to define methods of identification,technical design by level of&#13;
service, criteria for evaluation and selection of investment options, programming and&#13;
methods of execution. This Manual will be used by FRD to prepare for decisions to be&#13;
made by NCCRR. The adoption of the Manual is a condition for Board presentation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
A network inventory along with a priority maintenance program for the next six years are&#13;
being carried out. Effective creation of NCCRR, with adequate representation, is a&#13;
condition for Board presentation. During appraisal, the GOT confirmed the merging of&#13;
the FRD within the DGTP.&#13;
2.37 Local communities will provide regular manual routine maintenance for selected&#13;
low-traffic,public rural roadsthat serve their needs. This contributionwill be mobilized&#13;
from users and beneficiaries of these roads through fees or in-kind contributions of&#13;
maintenance work. For routine works requiring mechanical techniques, periodic&#13;
maintenance and repair of critical spots, the State will provide financial and technical&#13;
assistanceas needed. ExperiencedNGOs will help communitiesorganizethemselves,&#13;
select their network and mobilize resources. MMETPT line departments, supported by&#13;
skilled FRD technicians, will assist local communities in defining maintenance needs for&#13;
their network, and in preparing requests for Government financial participation in&#13;
mechanized maintenance works. With the exception of manual routine maintenance, works&#13;
should be contracted out to local SMEs and designed to use labor-intensive techniques to&#13;
maximize the impact of road works on employment. A pilot project promoting rural road&#13;
management by local communities will be launched to test the feasibility of reapportioning&#13;
management responsibility. This pilot will build on similar initiatives undertaken by local&#13;
rural associations in response to the economic recession induced by the political crisis.&#13;
Sector Management and Regulatory Regime&#13;
Issues&#13;
2.38 Poor management and coordination capacity. Public management of the sector&#13;
is characterized by lack of coordination and weak management capacity of transport sector&#13;
agencies. As noted in Section 2.C., several government and non-govemmentinstitutions&#13;
intervene in the management of the sector. MMETPT, through DGTP, manages the&#13;
national network and the maj or rural roads; responsibility for the remainder of the rural&#13;
network is theoretically divided among several government agencies, and government-&#13;
owned agribusiness companies. Investment programming is shared between the Ministere&#13;
du Plan et de l'Amenagementdu Territoire (Ministry of Planning and Land Management)&#13;
and other public institutions; however, since 1990, there has been no economic accounting&#13;
for the sector, nor monitoring of the effectivenessof public investments. DGT has poor&#13;
capacity to design and plan policy, and lacks an information system to provide statistical&#13;
and economic data on transport sector activities. In general, the finctioning of public&#13;
institutions is hampered by overall weaknesses in physical and human resources, especially&#13;
the professional qualification of supervisory staff.&#13;
2.39  Lack of Road TransportEfficiency. The road transport industry, with its ease of&#13;
entry, is characterized by a multitude of small service providers with poor quality vehicles,&#13;
only a few of whom operate in the formal sector. Productivityis reducedthroughthe&#13;
combined effects of a number of factors, notably the dispersal of the industry among several&#13;
providers, the age and poor condition of the fleet, excess supply, and the numerous&#13;
roadblocks that impede operators efficiency. Financial return is also low and does not allow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
truckers and carriers to self-finance or make use of bank loans, ensuring the continual&#13;
degradation of the rolling stock.&#13;
2.40  Current regulations lack coherency. The sector is generally deregulated, but&#13;
present regulations are outdated and incomplete. Generally, land transport regulations favor&#13;
the development of private initiative, although a few, poorly enforced tariffs act to inhibit it&#13;
slightly. In maritime transport, the Government plays a dominant role through the&#13;
implementation of the Code of Conduct of Conferences, but with mixed results.&#13;
Procurementprocedures remain cumbersome and inefficient. Private transport law is not&#13;
only antiquated but fragmented and not generally applied. The consequence is uncertain&#13;
enforcement, in which courts and arbitration seem to play a limited role. Law is deeply&#13;
imbued with local custom; the legal framework is somewhat ambiguous and gives rise to&#13;
multiple interpretations, which may compromise modernization efforts, even if, at present,&#13;
it provides flexibility in day-to-day management.&#13;
Government Strategy&#13;
2.41  The Government has already initiated several measures, part of the TSS&#13;
recommendations, aiming at addressing the above legal and institutionalissues. Transport&#13;
departments and FRD have been united under the MMETPT. Also under MMETPT, SET&#13;
has been created in August 1996, incorporating DGT and its subsectoral divisions, to take&#13;
charge of sector coordination, planning and policy design and implementation. SET is&#13;
reviewing the jurisdictions of sector institutions to clarify their respective responsibilities&#13;
and define coordinating mechanisms. A National Transport Council (NTC) is to be&#13;
established to follow up sector policy design and implementation, and ensure participation&#13;
by professional organizations and users. Bylaws establishing NTC and organizing SET and&#13;
its departments are under preparation. The GOT has also committed itselfto set up an&#13;
Interministerial Committee to design and oversee the implementation of appropriate&#13;
measures to reduce road checkpoints and mitigate their adverse impact. An action plan&#13;
comprising selected measures, satisfactory to IDA, to mitigate road checkpoints&#13;
effect will be transmitted by the GOT prior to Board presentation. This action plan&#13;
will be adopted after having consulted transport industry representativesand will be&#13;
published locally.&#13;
2.42  SET is also revising sector legislation and regulations with the objective of: (a)&#13;
aligning them on the official political choices of liberalization and promotion of private&#13;
initiative; (b) eliminating statutory impediments to the establishment of true competition in&#13;
the transport market, which is a prerequisite to improve and develop the competitiveness of&#13;
the Togolese economy. Prior to negotiations, the GOT submitted for IDA review&#13;
draft legislation to: (a) establish a Road Transport Code to endow the sector with&#13;
appropriate legislation; and (b) incorporate the guiding principles of the&#13;
Government Sector Policy Letter into a comprehensive legal framework (Transport&#13;
Policy Law), applicable to private and public institutions. The GOT will adopt the&#13;
above draft legislation and submit it to Parliament prior to Board presentation.&#13;
2.43  To facilitate policy design and investment planning, sectoral information will be&#13;
strengthened and consolidated through a data base. The new computerized system will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
collect, process and analyze statistical and economic data to generate information on&#13;
transport costs, investments, and the supply and demand for different types of transport&#13;
services. In addition, management and supervision tools will be developed within the&#13;
different branches of the DGTP and the DGT to facilitate their work and improve their&#13;
efficacy, especially: revision of the main operational manuals, computer equipment to&#13;
facilitate information gathering and analysis, computerization of technical management&#13;
tasks, and developmentof performance indicatorsto monitor physical and financial&#13;
progress in sector programs and projects.&#13;
Road Safety&#13;
2.44 High level of road accidents. Although vehicle ownership rate is low (10-12&#13;
vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants), the accident rate in 1994 was 107 fatalities per 1 0,000&#13;
vehicles, 10 times the rate in most industrialized countries, and 15 percent higher than&#13;
average for developing countries. There are more than 3,000 accidents per year in Togo,&#13;
with 3,703 injuries and 270 deaths in 1994. The level of risk for accidents, based on 1994&#13;
statistics, is 97 injuries and 7 fatalities per 10,000 inhabitants. This is on the same order of&#13;
magnitude for European countries which have 40 times the rate of vehicle ownership.&#13;
2.45  A road safety action plan has been developed and partially applied under the IDA-&#13;
funded Transport Rehabilitation Project. To consolidate the gains and pursue the&#13;
objectives sought under this project, GOT intends to implement the following action&#13;
plan: (a) establish a National Road Safety Council (NRSC) to design and oversee road&#13;
safety policy and an Office of Road Safety (ORS) to manage and implement the&#13;
Government policy; (b) build and outfit a Vehicle Inspection Center (VIC) in Lome; (c)&#13;
revise the Road Code; (d) undertake, on regular basis: (i) collection and processing of&#13;
data on road accidents, (ii) information and public awareness campaigns, and (iii) training&#13;
of road safety officers and driving instructors; and (e) implement a priority program of&#13;
road improvement and safety on the RN1 (North-South axis) and elimination of&#13;
dangerous intersections in Lome. The GOT has already drafted legislation to establish&#13;
NRSC and ORS; enactment of this legislation is expected in 1997. The GOT confirmed&#13;
during negotiations that the ORS will be established during the first year of the&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. ROAD TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
A. TRANSPORT SECTOR PROGRAM AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The GOT's Transport Sector Investment Program is a ten-year operation to realize&#13;
the objectives of the Transport Sector Strategy. The first, six-year tranche, the Road&#13;
Sector Investment Program (RSIP), comprises priority investments amounting to CFAF&#13;
109 billion, of which approximately 80 percent will be allocated to rehabilitate existing&#13;
road infrastructure. Table 3.1 outlines the components of this first tranche; more detail is&#13;
given in Annexes B and C. The RSIP was designed within acceptable macro-economic&#13;
parameters (22 percent of public Gross Fixed Capital Formation), and comprises only&#13;
those maintenance operations that generate at least a 12 percent economic rate of return&#13;
(ERR) and respect the country's constraints on investment and recurrent-cost financing.&#13;
Following consultations between the GOT and donors during the December 1995 and&#13;
March 1997 donor roundtable, the Government agreed during negotiations to update&#13;
the priority investment program annually to ensure that it addresses emerging&#13;
sector priorities, and to coordinate donor participation. This will enable the GOT to&#13;
ensure that sector investments are coherent and economically justified, and that adequate&#13;
financing is available.&#13;
3.2   Objectives for the Road Sector Investment Program. The Government's six-&#13;
year RSIP (1997-2002) includes the priorities defined under the 1996 Transport Sector&#13;
Strategy, described previously, and established in the Government Sector Policy Letter&#13;
(see Annex A). The main strategic objectives of the RSIP conform precisely to those&#13;
defined by the Government in the ERAC. These objectives aim to help the country to: (a)&#13;
open the economy to facilitate private sector development, accelerate the economic&#13;
recovery and firmly establish economic growth; (b) reduce the deficit by rationalizing&#13;
(redirecting) public expenditures; (c) prioritize rehabilitation and maintenance over&#13;
extension of the country's infrastructure; and (d) reduce poverty by providing basic&#13;
public infrastructure and services, and creating employment.&#13;

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.3     The proposed IDA project will address the most important priorities of the RSIP&#13;
to complement and reinforce IDA's ongoing assistance to support Togo's economic&#13;
recovery and sustained growth. More specifically, the project will support operations to&#13;
(a) rehabilitate and maintain both national and rural roads; (b) provide regular and stable&#13;
road maintenance financing from local resources; (c) encourage private sector&#13;
involvement in subsector development; (d) improve road safety; and (e) revitalize and&#13;
strengthen the management capacity of transport sector institutions. Two important&#13;
innovations mark the proposed IDA Credit: (a) the crossover from permanent to short-&#13;
term technical assistance, with measurable objectives and results; and (b) the introduction&#13;
of mechanisms for user participation in decision-making on road maintenance financing,&#13;
through the Road Council (the RMF board) and in management of the rural road network.&#13;
3.4     The proposed US$ 50 million IDA Credit will finance works, goods and services&#13;
for four components. First, IDA will support remedial maintenance on the paved road&#13;
network, rehabilitation of critical sections of RN 1, and rehabilitation and regraveling of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
the most important sections of the national unpaved road network to improve their&#13;
condition to a level that facilitates sustainable maintenance. The IDA Credit will also&#13;
support institutional strengthening to improve public sector management capacity to&#13;
improve sector coordination, investment planning and monitoring, road maintenance&#13;
programming and implementation, and to facilitate private sector involvement in&#13;
transport and public works. IDA funds will likewise contribute to improving road safety.&#13;
Finally, IDA will participate in building mechanisms for beneficiary and community&#13;
participation in rural road management capacity. The four components are outlined&#13;
below. Annex C gives a more detailed description of each component, while component&#13;
costs are detailed in Annex B.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
3.5   Road repair and maintenance (US$ 48.6 million). The objectives of this&#13;
component are to: (a) reduce transport costs by restoring the national road network up to,&#13;
and maintaining it in, a functional state; (b) improve the competitiveness of the Togolese&#13;
transit corridor; and (c) improve the accessibility of rural areas and support agricultural&#13;
development.&#13;
3.6   This component comprises works included in first-tranche priority program&#13;

management component aims at: (a) improving access to agricultural areas and services&#13;
in rural areas; (b) improving the planning and management of the rural road networks by&#13;
rationalizing investments in rural feeder roads and standardizing norms for their&#13;
maintenance; and (c) mobilizing local community participation in rural road maintenance&#13;
and management.&#13;
3.12  Expanding on the latter objective, this component is a pilot operation to test&#13;
community participation in feeder roads management. It is based on a partnership&#13;
between Government and local communities, in which the communities select roads to be&#13;
included in the program, according to local priorities and criteria defined in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual, and provide manual routine maintenance on these roads. The&#13;
Government will finance periodic maintenance on these roads, and will provide technical&#13;
assistance to communities, as needed. This pilot will cover 3 different zones,&#13;
representative of the country's socio-economic profile, and will include: (a) elimination&#13;
of critical spots over approximately 300 km of rural roads distributed over the 3 zones;&#13;
(b) NGO assistance to mobilize community participation in rural road management and&#13;
contribute to implementation of priority maintenance works, and (c) assistance to the&#13;
DGTP and the NCCRR to strengthen their capacity to coordinate investments, programn&#13;
rural road maintenance, and promote community participation.&#13;
3.13 Technical Assistance over All Components. The IDA Credit will finance a total&#13;
of 56 p/m of TA for the institutional strengthening component, 11 p/m for the road safety&#13;
component and 73 p/m (of which 58 are to be provided by local consultants) for the rural&#13;
road network rehabilitation and management component. This TA will consist entirely of&#13;
studies and short-term assistance.&#13;
C. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
3.14 The total cost of project components financed by IDA amounts to&#13;
US$ 54.8 million (CFAF 28.2 billion), including counterpart financing from the&#13;
Government of Togo, exclusive of taxes but including contingencies. These costs are&#13;
priced as of July 1996 on the basis of recent equipment and civil engineering&#13;
procurement. The IDA-financed components will be implemented over the next four&#13;
years between January 1998 and March 2002. Financial contingency provisions have&#13;
been established on the annual inflation rates given in Table 3.2 below.&#13;

3.15    The proposed IDA Credit of US$ 50 million will finance 91 percent of the cost of&#13;
project components, net of duties and taxes. This will cover approximately&#13;
US$ 31.5 million (63 percent) of foreign costs, and US$ 18.5 million (37 percent) of local&#13;
costs. Detailed information on the financing arrangements for the IDA components is&#13;
given in Annex B, and summarized in Table 3.4 below. Counterpart financing&#13;
(US$ 4.7 million) will be provided as follows: US$ 3.7 million as a GOT budget&#13;
allocation, mainly for road network rehabilitation works, US$ 1.0 million from the RMF&#13;
to contribute to periodic maintenance of unpaved roads, and US$ 0.1 million from the&#13;
beneficiaries to contribute to rural road rehabilitation. Local counterpart funds provided&#13;
from the Government budget will be made available through project accounts&#13;
administered by the DGTP. Prior to Credit effectiveness, the GOT will open a DGTP&#13;
Project account and make an initial deposit (CFAF 133 million). The GOT agreed&#13;
during negotiations to replenish the DGTP Project account with the same amount&#13;
(CFAF 133 million) on a regular quarterly basis over the period 1998-2001.&#13;

D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Implementation Manual&#13;
3.16 Detailed project implementation procedures are recorded in a Project&#13;
Implementation Manual (PIM). In particular, PIM will include procurement&#13;
arrangements, standard bidding documents, key performance indicators, quarterly&#13;
reporting formats, selection criteria for priority roads and works, detailed instructions for&#13;
ex-post road work supervision, environmental guidelines for road works, economic&#13;
justification methodology, and copies of official documents, such as the Ministry of&#13;
Finance delegation of road work procurement authority to the MMETPT. Prior to&#13;
negotiations, a draft PIM was discussed. The GOT agreed during negotiations to the&#13;
final PIM, which is to be adopted by the Government (MMETPT and Ministry of&#13;
Finance) prior to Board presentation. It may be updated as necessary during project&#13;
implementation, with IDA concurrence. Project implementation, arrangements and the&#13;
Credit are summarized below.&#13;
IDA Credit Coordination&#13;
3.17 An IDA Credit Coordinator, attached to the MMETPT, will coordinate project&#13;
implementation, including: (a) overall coordination of the IDA-financed components; (b)&#13;
liaison with SET and donors to ensure adherence to the TSS and to administer and update&#13;
the entire Transport Sector Investment Program; and (c) management of expenditures&#13;
under the IDA Credit, including Credit allocation. Prior to negotiations, the&#13;
MMETPT nominated a Project Coordinator, acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.18 The GOT agreed during negotiations to carry out, 24 month after Credit&#13;
effectiveness, jointly with the Association and other donors, a mid-term review of the&#13;
progress made in executing the priority investment program and the proposed project.&#13;
This review will cover: (a) the implementation of measures designed to strengthen the&#13;
financial reporting, monitoring, accounting and auditing capabilities of the different&#13;
Borrower agencies involved in project implementation; (b) the overall progress made in&#13;
the program and Credit implementation; (c) the adequacy of the Borrower's counterpart&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
funding as well as the level of budgetary allocations and actual expenditures for routine&#13;
maintenance; (d) the functioning of the Road Maintenance Fund; and (e) the need to&#13;
redesign and/or restructure project components experiencing implementation difficulties.&#13;
Not later than one month prior to the mid-term review, the Borrower will furnish to the&#13;
Association a report, for its review and comments, on the preceding topics, including an&#13;
evaluation of the progress achieved in complying with project implementation, and&#13;
recommendations resulting from studies conducted under the project.&#13;
3.19 Before October 31 of each year of project implementation, the DGTP will&#13;
prepare and submit for review by IDA and the RMF Road Council, the updated road&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance program with the request for financing priority works&#13;
from the Credit and the RMF, before its incorporation into the PIP. The Government has&#13;
agreed to include in its request only those investments: (a) that are necessary to improve&#13;
road infrastructure and which have an economic return higher than 12 percent, and (b) for&#13;
which routine maintenance funding is demonstrated through projected resources for the&#13;
Road Maintenance Fund. The Government agreed during negotiations not to&#13;
undertake any new investments before ensuring the financing of the existing&#13;
network rehabilitation . Choice of rehabilitation sites will be prioritized by level of&#13;
economic return and degradation.&#13;
3.20 At least every two years, the Government will organize a roundtable to examine&#13;
project financing and to define the annual tranches for the priority program. The first&#13;
roundtable will be held on March 1997; subsequent roundtable will take place before the&#13;
end of 1999 and 2001. At these roundtables, the Government will provide the donors&#13;
with a detailed report, to include: (a) the implementation status of the investment and&#13;
maintenance programs; (b) performance indicators; and (c) progress achieved in applying&#13;
policy and institutional measures in each of the transport subsectors, as defined in the&#13;
TSS.&#13;
Implementation of the National Road Network Rehabilitation and Maintenance&#13;
Component&#13;
3.21  The road component will be carried out by the MMETPT, through the DGTP.&#13;
Per the amended Public Procurement Decree, the DGTP will issue calls for bids, award&#13;
contracts, sign (or cause to be signed) said contracts, and manage rehabilitation, routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance contracts that are financed by the RMF or by the Credit. Such&#13;
procurement will be carried out in accordance with procedures set out in a Road&#13;
Maintenance Procedure Manual and performance indicators pertaining to the timing of&#13;
each procurement step to be performed by the DGTP. The DGTP will recruit consultants&#13;
to carry out technical studies and supervise works financed by the Credit. The GOT&#13;
agreed during negotiations that consultants appointed for works supervision will&#13;
assist the DGTP in finalizing the bidding documents and evaluating the resulting&#13;
bids. The GOT agreed during negotiations on environmental guidelines for&#13;
environmental impact assessments to be included in technical studies of road works.&#13;
Final technical studies and bidding documents for a first tranche of paved roads&#13;
rehabilitation works are underway, and will be completed prior to Board&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
presentation. It was agreed that the Credit and the RMF will only finance rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance works that are contracted out.&#13;
3.22 Prior to October 31 of each year of project implementation, the MMETPT will&#13;
prepare and transmit for IDA review: (a) a report on project implementation status and&#13;
projections for the road maintenance program, including routine maintenance to be&#13;
financed by the RMF; and (b) an update of the priority program for the following year.&#13;
The Government will undertake new rehabilitation works financed by the Credit after&#13;
approval by IDA of annual maintenance program. IDA approval will be based on, inter&#13;
alia: (a) actual performance each year of planned routine maintenance works, accepted by&#13;
RMF board and IDA, and adequate funding of works by the RMF; and (b) effective&#13;
collection by the RMF of the entirety of user fee revenues raised at the fee level&#13;
determined for the year. RMF operating costs and DGTP incremental operating costs&#13;
will be limited to less than four percent of RMF total revenues. The Government has&#13;
agreed to grant the RMF the authority to raise resources directly through justified road&#13;
tolls, to be established during project implementation, and through a user fee on&#13;
petroleum products. The Government has set this fee at CFAF 15/liter for 1997, and&#13;
agreed during negotiations to increase the fee by CFAF 5/liter per year over the&#13;
period 1998-2001. The RMF will use these resources to finance all routine maintenance&#13;
of the national road network, and an increasing share of periodic maintenance of unpaved&#13;
roads, as set out in Annex B. Should the RMF not be able to mobilize sufficient funds to&#13;
finance road maintenance at the agreed level, the Government will increase its allocation&#13;
to the RMF to cover at least the required level for routine maintenance of the national&#13;
road network (see Annex B). Prior to June 30 of each year, the Government will&#13;
provide IDA with audit reports of the RMF accounts, performed by an external auditor&#13;
and based on terms of reference acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening Component Implementation&#13;
3.23 This component will be carried out by the DGTP and the DGT. Each executing&#13;
agency will prepare an annual training and support program, in close collaboration with&#13;
the beneficiaries. These annual programs are to be transmitted for IDA review before&#13;
October 31 of each year. The DGTP will be responsible for implementing its own&#13;
program of support, in addition to the training program for the private construction sector.&#13;
The DGT will carry out the support program for the DGT and the DTR, as well as the&#13;
training program for transport industry operators. The DGT and the DGTP will appoint&#13;
consultants to design and carry out training programs, and set up management&#13;
information systems in each of the ministries.&#13;
Road Safety Component Implementation&#13;
3.24 The DGT will initiate the Road Safety Component. During the first year of&#13;
project implementation, the DGT is to develop a road safety program conforming to the&#13;
Government policy set out in the TSS. This program will be reviewed by IDA and&#13;
carried out by the ORS. This program will be updated and transmitted for IDA review&#13;
before November 30 of each year. Activities for the following year should be approved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
by the SET before being implemented by the ORS. The ORS will keep the SET and IDA&#13;
informed of component implementation through quarterly progress reports. The DGTP&#13;
will be responsible for building the Vehicle Inspection Center (VIC) to benefit from its&#13;
delegated authority and streamlined procurement procedures. Design of the Center and&#13;
preparation of bidding documents will rest with the DGT, assisted by the DTR.&#13;
Preparation of the VIC construction and equipment bidding documents, satisfactory&#13;
to IDA, is a condition for Board presentation. The VIC will be operated by the ORS&#13;
to benefit from its autonomy and ensure that an adequate level of service and&#13;
maintenance of Center equipment is provided. Measures to eliminate accident-inducing&#13;
spots on the road network will be identified by the ORS and implemented by the DGTP&#13;
as part of the network maintenance works.&#13;
Feeder Road Management Component Implementation&#13;
3.25 The MMETPT will implement the rural road component through the DGTP and&#13;
its regional departments. Programming and contract administration will follow the same&#13;
procedures as those outlined for the national road network and will use the same standard&#13;
bidding documents. The reorganized FRD, within the DGTP, will manage the feeder road&#13;
data base and the priority maintenance program. Restructuring of the FRD and&#13;
merging within the DGTP is a condition for Board presentation. In conjunction with&#13;
NGOs, the FRD will provide technical expertise at the regional level to promote&#13;
community participation in feeder road management and maintenance. Adoption of the&#13;
Rural Road Management Manual is a condition for Board presentation. The GOT&#13;
agreed during negotiations that the financing by the Credit of the rehabilitation&#13;
work program for each selected rural community will require adherence to&#13;
eligibility criteria spelled out in the Guide and that it is further conditioned upon&#13;
receipt by IDA of the evidence indicating that local partners have actually carried&#13;
out, or caused to be carried out, initial site preparation for rehabilitation works and&#13;
manual routine maintenance works for which they are responsible, and which make&#13;
up their contribution to the project.&#13;
3.26  Works programming and phasing will be determined in close collaboration with&#13;
the local communities responsible for individual road sections with the help of a&#13;
specialized NGO and DGTP road technicians. The final program will be confirmed by the&#13;
NCCRR, assisted by the FRD. No rehabilitation or maintenance works will be carried&#13;
out with IDA financing until the necessary arrangements to finance and carry out routine&#13;
maintenance have been defined and finalized in a written agreement with the requesting&#13;
communities. Rehabilitation works will be contracted out to SMEs using simplified&#13;
bidding documents satisfactory to IDA. The DGTP will select NGOs and support local&#13;
communities in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (January&#13;
1997). The NCCRR, aided by the FRD, will monitor execution of this component and its&#13;
pilot, with the objective of defining a national strategy for rural road maintenance. In&#13;
addition, the FRD will conduct periodic assessments of the component with the objective&#13;
of providing advice on corrective measures and fine-tuning -the feeder roads strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Detailed procurement procedures and arrangements are provided in Annex B. Unless&#13;
otherwise indicated below, procurement arrangements for items financed by the Credit&#13;
are as follows: (a) all equipment and civil works contracts will be awarded on the basis of&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB or NCB for works, and ICB, NCB and Local Shopping for&#13;
goods); (b) all civil works construction will be supervised by consultants acceptable to&#13;
IDA under agreed-upon terms of reference; (c) consultants and experts for technical&#13;
assistance will be recruited in accordance with provisions stated below; (d) procurement&#13;
decisions for civil works and goods in excess of US$ 100,000 equivalent, for consulting&#13;
services with firms, and for consulting services with individuals or training activities in&#13;
excess of US$ 50,000 (covering 85 percent of all procurement) will be subject to prior&#13;
approval by IDA; (e) notwithstanding para. (iv) above for all equipment contracts less&#13;
than US$ 20,000 equivalent and awarded by shopping procedures, prior review by IDA&#13;
will be required for documents listed in Schedule 3, Section I, part D para. 2 of the Credit&#13;
Agreement; (f) procurement decisions for consulting services with firms in excess of&#13;
US$ 50,000 equivalent but less than US$ 100,000 equivalent will be subject to prior&#13;
approval by IDA, as specified in detail in the Credit Agreement, Schedule 3, section II,&#13;
part D, para. 2; and (g) post-review procedures will be applied for contracts in amounts&#13;
below these specified thresholds. Contracts for civil works which are unlikely to attract&#13;
international competition will be awarded on the basis of procedures for locally&#13;
advertised competitive bidding (NCB), according to procedures reviewed and accepted by&#13;
IDA. Procedures for launching calls for bids, bid evaluation, contract award, signature&#13;
and approval will be carried out in conformance with procedures included in the PIM,&#13;
finalized during negotiations.&#13;
3.28 The Bank's standard bidding documents will be used. The GOT agreed during&#13;
negotiations to Bank standard bidding documents and standard bid evaluation&#13;
reports for goods and civil works under ICB, civil works under NCB which might&#13;
interest local SMEs, and consultant services contracts, and the processing time for&#13;
key procurement activities.&#13;
3.29 Civil Works. All contracts for civil works in excess of US$ 400,000 equivalent&#13;
will be awarded on the basis of ICB. Contracts for civil works under US$ 400,000&#13;
equivalent, but not exceeding US$ 4.6 million in aggregate may be awarded on the basis&#13;
of NCB. International enterprises are best qualified to execute major improvement works&#13;
on unpaved roads or bridges, and works on paved roads, such as rehabilitation. Local&#13;
contractor capacity is to be developed under the RTP through on-site assistance to carry&#13;
out contracts for routine, and light periodic maintenance of paved and unpaved roads.&#13;
International firms are usually not interested in minor, scattered improvements on the&#13;
unpaved or rural road networks; packaging of such works will be tailored to the abilities&#13;
of local contractors. Therefore, 90 percent of works is expected to be awarded by ICB,&#13;
and 10 percent by NCB. Foreign firms, if interested, may participate in NCB.&#13;

3.30   Consultancies. All consultancies financed by IDA will be contracted in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (January 1997).&#13;
Consultants' services will be procured under contracts awarded on a quality and cost-&#13;
based selection. The short list of consultants for services estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$ 100,000 can comprise entirely national consultants. Nevertheless, three different&#13;
types of selection may be authorized for consultancies under the conditions following: (a)&#13;
Least cost selection: advisory services and services for audit, and training under&#13;
components B, C and D of the project and estimated to cost less than US$ 150,000 may&#13;
be procured under contracts awarded by least cost selection; (b) Single source selection:&#13;
advisory services and services for training under components B, C and D estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$ 100,000 may be procured under contracts awarded by single source&#13;
selection with the Bank prior agreement; and (c) Individual consultants: advisory services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
and services for training under components B, C and D and estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$ 50,000 may be procured under contracts awarded to individual consultants. Services&#13;
for assistance to local communities under the rural road component would be executed by&#13;
experienced NGOs or consultant specialized in community participation area. The GOT&#13;
confirmed during negotiations that the consultants responsible for works&#13;
supervision will assist the DGTP in finalizing the bidding documents and evaluating&#13;
the resulting bids. NGOs will be hired after careful selection following consultation&#13;
made on the same basis as for consultant services.&#13;
3.31   Goods will be procured by ICB, with the exception of goods contracts each less&#13;
than or equal to US$ 50,000 equivalent, which in aggregate do not exceed US$ 750,000&#13;
will be procured by NCB. Contracts each estimated to cost less than US$ 20,000, which&#13;
in aggregate will not exceed US$ 100,000 may be procured by national shopping.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
3.32 The Credit is to be fully disbursed by March 31, 2002, and the Credit closing date&#13;
will be September 30, 2002. Annex B presents the estimated disbursement schedule for&#13;
the IDA Credit, the detailed disbursement schedule, Credit categories and disbursement&#13;
percentages. The Credit will be disbursed as follows in Table 3.6.&#13;

3.33  Special Accounts. To facilitate disbursement and reduce the volume of&#13;
withdrawal application, a special account will be opened in CFA francs for the DGTP.&#13;
The authorized allocations amount to US$ 1.5 million equivalent. The amounts are&#13;
estimated to cover approximately four months of expenditures. The Special Account will&#13;
be opened upon Credit effectiveness, and would finance expenditures under all project&#13;
categories. The GOT agreed during negotiations to management by the DGTP of the&#13;
Special Account and payment of expenditures. Upon Credit effectiveness, an amount&#13;
of US$ 750,000 equivalent, representing 50 percent of authorized allocations will be&#13;
deposited in the Special Account. The remaining balance will be made available as&#13;
needed. The Special Account will be used for all payments representing less than 20&#13;
percent of the authorized allocations. Request for replenishments would be submitted&#13;
monthly and include bank statements and reconciliation statements.&#13;
3.34  All replenishment requests are to be fully documented, except for: (a) civil works&#13;
and equipment contracts of less than US$ 200,000 equivalent; (b) contracts of less than&#13;
US$ 100,000 for consultant services provided by firms; (c) contracts of less than&#13;
US$ 50,000 for consulting services by individuals; and (d) training, studies and operating&#13;
expenses which may be claimed on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs). All&#13;
supporting documents for expenditures will be retained by the DGTP for review by&#13;
periodic Bank supervision missions and external auditors.&#13;
F. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
3.35  The DGTP will be responsible for accounting for Credit expenditures and Special&#13;
Account transactions including Statement of Expenditures. All expenditures under the&#13;
Credit will be recorded and consolidated by the DGTP under the supervision of the Credit&#13;
Coordinator, who will countersign all withdrawal applications. Nomination by the&#13;
DGTP of an accountant, acceptable to IDA, to operate and maintain the existing&#13;
accounting system, is a condition for Board presentation. The GOT agreed during&#13;
negotiations to the annual auditing of the Credit account, the Special Account,&#13;
Statements of Expenditures by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The GOT&#13;
also agreed during negotiations to the annual auditing of RMF and ORS accounts&#13;
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The setting up by the RMF of an&#13;
accounting system and designation of an accountant, acceptable to IDA is a&#13;
condition for Board presentation. Auditor missions will include the detailed audits of&#13;
Credit accounts and SOEs with an opinion; the audit of the Special Account with a&#13;
separate opinion and management letter, to include the analysis of the internal control and&#13;
accounting procedures along with recommendations to management. Auditor reports will&#13;
be submitted to IDA not later than six months after the close of their fiscal year. In&#13;
addition to Credit audit reports, the RMF and the ORS will also furnish to IDA, not later&#13;
than six months after the close of their fiscal year, separate audit reports on their&#13;
respective operations. The DGTP, the RMF and the ORS will select project auditors&#13;
prior to Board presentation, and their contracts will be signed prior to Credit&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
3.36 The Credit Coordinator in the DGTP will prepare, and submit for IDA review, a&#13;
quarterly progress report within one month after the end of each quarter. This report will&#13;
include: (a) progress achieved with respect to agreed-upon implementation and&#13;
disbursement schedules; (b) key performance indicators; and (c) work programs -and cost&#13;
estimates for the coming quarter and for the entire project, including those to be financed&#13;
by the RMF. Performance indicators are listed in Annex B. The main purpose of the&#13;
report will be to provide timely and updated information on implementation of project&#13;
components, highlighting issues and problem areas, recommending actions and&#13;
commenting on progress in resolving previous issues. The DGTP will prepare a&#13;
completion report within six months of the final disbursements in accordance with IDA&#13;
guidelines. The GOT agreed during negotiations to reporting formats and&#13;
requirements, and key performance indicators, and agreed that the DGTP will&#13;
submit to IDA copies of all consultant reports and studies financed through the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
G. SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
3.37 The GOT agreed during negotiations that the MMETPT will hold a project&#13;
launching workshop as soon as the Credit becomes effective, and that IDA will&#13;
conduct a mid-term review two years from the date of Credit effectiveness, during which&#13;
the status of the entire project will be reviewed in detail. During this mid-term review,&#13;
IDA will pay particular attention to: (a) compliance with covenants, especially those&#13;
pertaining to financing and auditing; (b) progress in implementing project components;&#13;
the results of the road and institutional strengthening subcomponents, and variance from&#13;
appraisal estimates; (c) status of RMF operations and financing of road maintenance; (d)&#13;
status of the preparation of Togo's ruraf roads strategy based on the results of the IDA-&#13;
supported pilot operation. The review will be carried out jointly by IDA, the&#13;
Government, the DGTP, the SET, the RMF, and eventually other donors as they resume&#13;
support to the transport sector. Corrective measures may be proposed as a result of this&#13;
review, including necessary modifications in the scope of the proposed project, and in the&#13;
Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
3.38 The proposed supervision program for IDA components and the key performance&#13;
indicators for monitoring their progress were designed during appraisal and were&#13;
confirmed during negotiations. The first two years of project implementation will&#13;
require 24 staff weeks of supervision, and the following years 20 staff weeks per year. A&#13;
table presenting the proposed mission activities and staffing, and a list of performance&#13;
indicators are provided in Annex B. Routine supervision by IDA should normally&#13;
include a transport specialist and an engineer experienced in road maintenance and,&#13;
periodically, procurement specialists.&#13;
3.39  The supervision should ensure that the priority investment program and road&#13;
maintenance program conform to macro-economic conditions. The supervision will pay&#13;
particular attention to RMF operations, in particular resource use and replenishment.&#13;
Preparation of the priority program, with its annual tranches, will require specific skills in&#13;
transport economics and highway engineering. IDA's annual review of the priority&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
program will require expertise in economic analysis, and road construction and&#13;
maintenance standards. IDA will play a major role in donor coordination during donors'&#13;
meetings, where these programs will be revised and updated. The meetings will take&#13;
place during IDA supervision missions. Involvement of a number of small enterprises in&#13;
civil works execution will also require close supervision and special attention to ensure&#13;
acceptable quality standards and timely completion of works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
4. BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS&#13;
A. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
4.1   Project Benefits. All road improvement will reduce transport time and vehicle&#13;
operating costs, leading to a reduction in overall transport costs. Reduction of transport&#13;
costs will lower the cost of transported goods, encouraging agricultural production and&#13;
trade. Reduction of transport costs will likewise lower passenger fares, encouraging&#13;
mobility. Other, non-quantifiable benefits are expected to flow from IDA-supported&#13;
activities that improve management and planning. Effective use of the priority program as&#13;
an investment tool should result in higher rates of return on investments in the transport&#13;
sector as a whole. Development of a community-based, demand-driven rural roads&#13;
maintenance strategy will lead to more effective use of resources. Better planning and&#13;
contract management, based on improved road data, will enable maintenance of more&#13;
roads with the same budget. Improvements in road safety will reduce the cost of traffic&#13;
accidents in terms of human life and productivity, and damage to vehicles. Economic&#13;
analyses for individual IDA components are summarized below, and detailed in&#13;
Annex E.&#13;
4.2   Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance. Economic analysis undertaken during&#13;
preparation covered all road sector investments for the Government's ten-year program.&#13;
Even though the four IDA components are but part of this larger priority program,&#13;
economic analysis of the larger program facilitates rational selection of investments by&#13;
IDA and other donors. This analysis included a section-by-section review of proposed&#13;
trouble spot repairs, regraveling and rehabilitation of unpaved roads, and definition of&#13;
optimal maintenance strategies for both the paved and unpaved road networks. ERRs&#13;
were also calculated for maintenance cost flows. Cost streams include the cost of works&#13;
required to bring key sections of the network up to a service level at which regular&#13;
maintenance is viable, in addition to maintenance costs. Benefits are taken to be savings&#13;
in vehicle operating costs due to improved road surfaces; time savings were not included.&#13;
The base case is defined as continuation of the lowest level of service, or deterioration to&#13;
this level, at which vehicles can still actually use the road. This is the only way to&#13;
generate a baseline level of vehicle operating costs, which may then be compared to the&#13;
"with-investment" level. In practice, it should be noted, in a case in which no road&#13;
maintenance is undertaken, roads become impassable and traffic virtually ceases. Only&#13;
minimum maintenance costs are included in the base case, since, in their present state,&#13;
some roads cannot even be maintained without remedial repair to upgrade their standard&#13;
to a minimum required to maintain traffic flows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
4.3   Paved road works include only rehabilitation of badly deteriorated sections of the&#13;
interurban network. Cost-benefit analyses were carried out during program preparation&#13;
using the Highway Design Model (HDM). Rehabilitation design and work costs were&#13;
based on technical standards developed during TSS preparation, and recent works costs&#13;
provided by the DGTP. The HDM vehicle operating cost module was calibrated to&#13;
account for used cars, which make up the core of Togo's vehicle fleet. The results of the&#13;
economic analysis are shown in Annex E. The ERR of the priority program over the&#13;
paved network is about 460 percent. The total Net Present Value (NPV) at a 12 percent&#13;
discount rate, is estimated at CFAF 440 billion, while the Net Present Cost is estimated at&#13;
CFAF 37 billion. The rehabilitation of the three road sections (Lom6-Ts6vi6, Tsevi&amp;&#13;
Noste, Attakpam6-Blitta) as currently proposed for IDA financing shows a very high&#13;
ERR (infinite or 192 percent). Additional program financing is still being sought, in any&#13;
case the IDA Credit will participate in the financing of the rehabilitation of one of the&#13;
most deteriorated section of RN1. Sensitivity analysis shows that a drop in the rate of&#13;
patching from 50 to 20 percent would reduce the NPV of the proposed investment by 4&#13;
percent, and raise overall maintenance costs by 4 percent. This demonstrates the need for&#13;
regularly performed routine maintenance over the life-span of the network (see Annex&#13;
E).&#13;
4.4   An optimal maintenance strategy for the unpaved road network was defined'&#13;
building on empirical evidence of road deterioration and earth road maintenance&#13;
experience in Togo and neighboring countries. The objective is to optimize the allocation&#13;
of road maintenance resources so as to maximize the number of practicable itineraries.&#13;
The optimal maintenance strategy for a given section maximizes the present value of the&#13;
difference between the cost of maintenance works and user cost savings. A 12 percent&#13;
discount rate was used. Cost-benefit analysis was also carried out to rank reviewed'&#13;
sections and select priorities. Vehicle operating costs were determined- using HDM with&#13;
appropriate adjustments for composition of traffic using the-earth road network. Cost of&#13;
works was based on private sector contracting. The ERRs for works on the 51 stretches&#13;
of unpaved national roads proposed for IDA financing range from 340 percent&#13;
to -2 percent, depending on'the section. The NPV, at'a 12 percent discount rate, is&#13;
estimated at CFAF 59 billion.' Works programming is directly prioritized by key&#13;
economic advantages, and only those sections with an ERR higher than 12 percent and&#13;
positive NPV will be considered under this project (49 sections, see- Annex E for more&#13;
details).&#13;
4.5   Sensitivity analyses were conducted over different values for the most important&#13;
variables: level of traffic (30 percent less than estimated), level of service over the entire&#13;
network (fair), and cost of works (30 percent more than estimated). Economic returns&#13;
remain high for the most heavily trafficked sections. However, ERRs for sections with&#13;
ERRs less than 20 percent in the Base Case dropped dramatically: 4 sections showed&#13;
ERRs under the 12 percent project inclusion ceiling. Following-this analysis, the project&#13;
would finance only the most heavily trafficked unpaved roads (first and second priority&#13;
option).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
4.6   While it is not possible to quantify the benefits of the other activities financed&#13;
under this component (road safety improvement, institutional strengthening, training and&#13;
studies for improved management, strengthening of SMEs, and overall IDA Credit&#13;
management), these activities will certainly generate benefits by lowering traffic accident&#13;
rates, improving the efficiency of resource use, and encouraging competition in the&#13;
private construction sector.&#13;
4.7   Feeder Road Management. There is no reliable data or approach to estimate&#13;
increased revenues for the beneficiaries of pilot rural areas from the additional&#13;
agricultural production, and better access to markets and services, which improved road&#13;
conditions are expected to induce. Farmers can be expected to make rational choices on&#13;
the sections of road to be proposed for rehabilitation and maintenance, based on their own&#13;
assessment of benefits likely to accrue to them. The component has been designed, in&#13;
fact, to apply selection criteria used in Government-sponsored programs, which take into&#13;
account user savings, increased agricultural production, and social and poverty impacts.&#13;
Should it not be possible to calculate an ERR, other simple criteria will be used, such as&#13;
population density or agricultural production per kilometer of road to be included in the&#13;
project. Taking a broader view, this component represents the minimum investment&#13;
required for the Government to design a viable rural roads strategy to replace the&#13;
unsuccessful and uneconomic approaches of the past, characterized by costly repeated&#13;
rehabilitation of umnaintained rural roads. The requirement of community contribution&#13;
to project costs, sufficient to ensure routine maintenance of included road sections, has&#13;
been adopted as a means to exclude economically unjustified investments from being&#13;
financed under this pilot program.&#13;
B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
4.8   Togo has developed a National Environmental Plan (NEP), with Bank assistance,&#13;
which defines the country's environmental policy. Implementation arrangements for this&#13;
policy, as defined in the NEP, ensure that economic development takes into account the&#13;
need to protect the environment over the long term. In line with environmental policy,&#13;
the RTP proposes specific measures to reduce any negative impacts from transport&#13;
activities to be undertaken under the project. The main environmental problems caused&#13;
by land transport are user safety, erosion and risk of flooding from road works, and&#13;
vehicular air pollution in concentrated urban areas. Fossil fuel consumption is another&#13;
potential problem, but this is minimized by the low rate of personal vehicle ownership,&#13;
and the intensive use of two-wheeled vehicles.&#13;
4.9   The proposed project does not include any new road construction, thereby&#13;
limiting the environmental impact. More directly, the project supports the NEP by&#13;
providing for development of a transport environmental action plan and environmental&#13;
guidelines (see Annex D). It also proposes to perform environmental impact assessments&#13;
prior to beginning any rehabilitation works, with particular attention to: (a) drainage&#13;
systems and road shoulders to reduce soil erosion; (b) treatment of accident-inducing&#13;
points (redesign, signage); and (c) treatment of local quarries for any project-related&#13;
material mining operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
4.10  Improvement of road safety is an important element of the proposed project. An&#13;
action plan has been proposed to establish a sustainable system of road safety financing&#13;
and management in Togo. The Bank-financed Transport Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1861-&#13;
TO) has begun road safety improvement measures, such as data systems, training for&#13;
drivers license examiners, and information campaigns. The Lome Urban Development&#13;
Project (Cr. 2620-TO) is undertaking other measures, such as redressing dangerous&#13;
intersections in Lome, creation of separate cycle paths, and drainage of flood-prone areas.&#13;
C. POVERTY REDUCTION&#13;
4.11  The transport sector plays a vital role in the reduction of poverty in Togo, both&#13;
through its general contribution to economic growth and through its direct role in creating&#13;
employment. The proposed project will moreover contribute to poverty reduction&#13;
through activities that: (a) offer new economic opportunities, especially to rural&#13;
populations, through improved rural infrastructure and services; and (b) generate&#13;
employment in both urban and rural areas.&#13;
4.12  The strategic choice to concentrate on maintaining existing infrastructure, rather&#13;
than undertake new investments, and to establish an adequate system of rural&#13;
infrastructure maintenance and development, will contribute substantially to reducing&#13;
poverty. In effect, reduction in transport costs stemming from infrastructure&#13;
improvements will lower costs of goods and services for all consumers, and therefore&#13;
increase purchasing power. Improvement in rural services (improving accessibility of&#13;
rural areas and reestablishing existing infrastructure) will enable rural populations, who&#13;
are the most touched by poverty, to be integrated into the modem economy. Access to&#13;
urban markets, with all of the facilities they provide, will enable rural populations to&#13;
improve their productivity, revenue and quality of life.&#13;
4.13  Labor-intensive road maintenance works performed by SMEs and autonomous&#13;
management of resources for infrastructure maintenance (RMF) facilitate the creation of&#13;
employment for unskilled and semi-skilled workers, reducing the rate of urban and rural&#13;
unemployment of unskilled workers from which the country is suffering. Promotion of&#13;
competent SMEs for works requiring technical expertise is one of the measures proposed&#13;
by the TSS. Some of these measures are already underway within the Urban&#13;
Development Project.&#13;
D. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
4.14 Generic Risk. The major risk to the project is posed by Togo's lingering fiscal&#13;
difficulties. If successful, the project will contribute greatly to the country's economic&#13;
revitalization, however success hinges on a prior ability to mobilize resources for the&#13;
RMF. Without these resources, road infrastructure vital to economic development,&#13;
already in critical condition, will continue to deteriorate to a point at which it becomes an&#13;
economic liability. This risk is mitigated by Government commitment to the CAS&#13;
objective to rehabilitate essential transport infrastructure, and the TSS recommendation to&#13;
place absolute priority on rehabilitation and maintenance of road infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
Mitigating measures within the RTP include: (a) as a condition of negotiation, the&#13;
establishment of the RMF with autonomous management, an independent agency to&#13;
collect revenues, and direct transfer of funds, without transit through the Treasury; and&#13;
(b) Government commitment to install toll booths on rehabilitated trunk roads to generate&#13;
revenues for the RMF.&#13;
4.15  Project-related Risk. The project is part of a sectoral reform effort, therefore the&#13;
main risks to IDA-supported components relate to new and innovative activities. These&#13;
are: (a) inadequate replenishment of the Road Maintenance Fund (discussed above); (b)&#13;
uncertainty of community participation in feeder road management; (c) insufficient local&#13;
SME technical capacity, including the risk of long delays in works execution; and (d)&#13;
lack of donor coordination. Another minor risk concerns transformation of sector&#13;
institutions, which should be mitigated by focusing project conditions on the institutions&#13;
most vital to project implementation.&#13;
4.16  Involvement of local communities in rural road maintenance and management&#13;
and the effectiveness of NGOs expected to support these communities is assumed but&#13;
uncertain. Many communities already perform routine road maintenance in the absence&#13;
of Government service. However, these maintenance efforts are scattered and&#13;
unprogrammed, and often suffer from inadequate technical capacity. The project will call&#13;
on local and/or international NGOs to mobilize and support local communities in road&#13;
maintenance and management. Communities and NGOs will receive further support&#13;
from DGTP engineers. DGTP field operatives will also act as liaisons between&#13;
communities and local and central administrations, to expedite NCCRR approval of local&#13;
maintenance programs, and facilitate local requests for maintenance works financing.&#13;
NGOs will be carefully screened well in advance of field operations, and will be offered&#13;
external assistance during the first year of the component. Should some local&#13;
communities show little motivation to organize into associations or collect funds, it&#13;
would merely slow the pace of implementation and delay development of the&#13;
Government's rural road maintenance strategy, without compromising project objectives.&#13;
4.17 In the past, SMEs in Togo, although active, have proven to be technically weak in&#13;
carrying out maintenance works contracts, resulting in significant delays in completion&#13;
and technical flaws. The following measures have been included in the project to smooth&#13;
implementation and further SME development. Through the project, DGTP will provide&#13;
targeted training to all SMEs prior to implementation of each type of maintenance&#13;
operation, to include works organization, relevant methods and techniques, and quality&#13;
control. This will be supplemented by on-site training and supervision. In addition,&#13;
works packages will be small and simple. For some highly technical works, SMEs may&#13;
undergo prequalification.&#13;
4.18  Donors were active in supporting Togo's transport sector before the 1991-93&#13;
political crisis, however their assistance tended to be piecemeal and uncoordinated. Since&#13;
the crisis, donors have been slow to resume lending to Togo. Given past experience and&#13;
current trends, there is a potential risk to maintaining donor coherence in sectoral&#13;
interventions. This risk is fairly small, since all transport sector donors participated in the&#13;
development of the TSS, and were consulted by the GOT before it approved the Sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
Strategy Note in May 1996. However, risk remains that donors will continue their&#13;
individual, scattered efforts. Indeed donors are already earmarking funds for rural road&#13;
programs, once lending resumes, well in excess of what is needed. Adoption of the&#13;
priority programn for feeder roads, and establishment of the NCCRR will help donors&#13;
reallocate their funds and optimize their interventions. The GOT will also hold donor&#13;
meeting every two years to discuss progress in implementing the sector strategy and the&#13;
RSIP, with the objective of coordinating interventions and raising additional funds for the&#13;
program.&#13;
4.19 A final, less important risk concerns institutional transformation. The DGTP has&#13;
taken the lead in reorganizing itself; DGTP staff have already accepted and assimilated&#13;
elements of this reorganization. The process began from within in 1991 and has made&#13;
steady progress ever since. The Credit will finance training and short-term technical&#13;
assistance for the DGTP to facilitate its restructuring and provide adequate management&#13;
tools, such as: a road data base, a management information system to assist in&#13;
maintenance programming, and relevant documentation.&#13;
&#13;

DECLARATION DE POLITIQUE GENERALE&#13;
DU GOUVERNEMENT POUR LA RESTRUCTURATION&#13;
DU SECTEUR DES TRANSPORTS ADOPT-EE EN CONSEIL&#13;
DES MINISTRES DU 29 MAI 1996&#13;
I     INqTRODUCTION&#13;
Le secteur des trasports en tant que support et vecteur de d&amp;veloppemnnt, joue um role&#13;
capital dans la vie 6cononique du Togo. L'exploitation dos infrastructures routi&amp;res, portuireu,&#13;
a6roportuaires et feroviaires pendant une longue periode a aussi comme dautres sectos&#13;
confird au Togo de bonnes performances econoniques, mais dopuis 1992, le pays a lravers6&#13;
une p6riode de turbulence sociale ct politique qui ra plonge dans une crise 6conotmique&#13;
prononcee. La depression econornique qui s'en est suivie a mis en grande difficulte le swcteur&#13;
des transports caractdris6 dans sa globalit6 par des cofits ilev6s et de longs delais&#13;
d'acherninements suivis dun 6tat de d6gradation continue de rinfrastructure. C'est danm le cadre&#13;
de ses efforts de redressement de recnomie nationale, que le gouvemement en colaboration&#13;
avec les insttutions de Bretton Woods acieve actuellement la mise en plce dun programme&#13;
d'ajustoment et de relance de l'conomie couvrant ia periode 1996 - 1998. L#objectif recherche&#13;
par les autort6s togolaises est la restauration des grands 6quhlibres macro-6conomiques, en vue&#13;
de crer les conditions indispensables a une croissance soutenue et durable au profit de la&#13;
population-&#13;
II. CONTEXTE MACRO ECONOMIOUE&#13;
1. Le contexte macro economique actuel est caractense par une contrainte budgetaire tres&#13;
forte. En effet la crise socio-politique, exacerb&amp;e par une grave g6nerale do Novembre 1992 i&#13;
Aout 1993 a serieusement affect6 rappareil de production nationale et le fonctionnement des&#13;
structures economiques et sociales du pays.&#13;
...n&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
Le produit national brut a considerablement baisse de meme que la production industrielle et&#13;
miniere atteignant parfois 9 % pour le PNB et 41 % pour la production industrielle et miniere.&#13;
De la meme maniere, les exportations ont chute rapidement deteriorant ainsi la balance globale&#13;
sous Veffet conjugue de la baisse des concours exterieurs.&#13;
Sous l'effet conjugue de I'ajustement de la parite du franc CFA intervenu en Janvier 1994 et du&#13;
retour de la stabilite sociale, la croissance economique a repris avec un accroissement du PB&#13;
de 11 %. Cette reprise semble se confirner en 1995 grace a la reprise en particulier des&#13;
services et des exportations. La situation des finances publiques stest egalement amelioree,&#13;
toutefois le deficit budgetaire demeure eleve (10 %) du PEB. Ce deficit ne sera retabli que si la&#13;
situation s'ameliore d'une maniere durable.&#13;
2. Strategie economique&#13;
Pour relancer la croissance economique, le gouvernement entend suivre une strategie, soutenue&#13;
par un Programme d'Ajustement Structurel et de Relance Economique (PARE), couvrant la&#13;
periode 1996-1998 dont les principaux objectifs sont d'enrayer les desequilibres economniques&#13;
et favoriser la croissance dans 1'6quit6 a travers les-inesures strategiques suivantes:&#13;
- diversifier la production et les exportations agricoles pour lesquelles le Togo&#13;
jouit dun avantage comparatif sur le marche exterieur;&#13;
- regenerer le secteur manufacturier grace aux PME et aux investissements&#13;
pnves;&#13;
- desengager l1'tat des activites de production pour lesquelles le secteur prive&#13;
dispose de meilleurs avantages comparatifs par rapport au secteur public;&#13;
- Relancer le secteur des services, domaine dans lequel les operateurs&#13;
gconomiques togolais ont reussi par le passe et;&#13;
- creer un environnement favorable a la promotion des investissements privms&#13;
permettant de redonner a Lome son dynarnisme en tant que place cornmerciale&#13;
et financiere regionale.&#13;
En matiere de finances publiques, l'objectif est de reduire les depenses, notanmuent celles non&#13;
directement productives, et accroitre la mobilisation des ressources.&#13;
ml. PRIORITES ECONOMIOUES AU NIVEAU SECTORIEL&#13;
En adoptant sa nouvelle strategie de developpement economique, le gouvernement s'est fixe&#13;
des priorites en matiere d'allocation des ressources budgetaires. Dans le domaine des depenses&#13;
courantes, la priorite sera donn6e en faveur de la sante, l'education, l'entretien des routes, ainsi&#13;
que la rehabilitation des infrastructures necessaires, d'une part, a l'activite economique (routes&#13;
et pistes) et d'autre part, a la sante publique: eau et assainissement. A court terme, l'accent&#13;
sera mis sur la rehabilitation et l'entretien de l'infrastructure en privilegiant les techniques a&#13;
forte intensite de main d'oeuvre pour favoriser l'emploi.&#13;
Imglication des Drioritis economiuues sur le secteur des transports&#13;
Dans le domaine des infrastructures, le retablissement d'un entretien normal est une necessite&#13;
d'autant plus importante que le Togo joue un role significatif au plan du commerce regional et&#13;
qu'il doit maintenir un reseau de transports et de communication fiable permettant d'offiir le&#13;
meilleur service au moindre couit.&#13;
..J3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
En reconnaissant le r6le du secteur des transports dans la relance de l'6conomie nationale le&#13;
Gouvemrnement a elabore une strategie de developpement de ce secteur pour: (i) identifier les&#13;
obstacles a lever et les reformes a entreprendre pour dynamiser les activites du secteur ; et (ii)&#13;
definir les actions prioritaires et le programme des investissements futurs du secteur. Pour&#13;
atteindre les objectifs de sa strategie de relance, le Gouvernement devra desormais traduire&#13;
dans les faits la priorite accordee a l'entretien et a la rehabilitation de l'infrastructure du pays.&#13;
IV. ETAT ACTUEL DU SECTEUR&#13;
Le diagnostic du secteur a permis de relever les faiblesses suivantes:&#13;
Institution et rfelementation&#13;
- la faiblesse des institutions dans le domaine de la planification economique et&#13;
financiere, de linformation technique et economique necessaire a la realisation des&#13;
actions de developpement, sur le plan materiel et de la qualification des ressources&#13;
humaines;&#13;
- 1'insuffisance de clarte dans le partage des competences et dans la coordination&#13;
necessaire entre les differentes institutions;&#13;
- un vide important en matiere de droit prive des transports ne permettant pas de&#13;
s6curiser les investissements prives;&#13;
- une reglementation parfois rigide telle que la fixation des tarifs limitant l'efficacite des&#13;
operateurs et la repartition du trafic maritime engendrant des surcouts des transports&#13;
aux produits togolais;&#13;
- la lourdeur des procedures de passation des marches publics.&#13;
Gestion des Infrastructures routieres&#13;
L'inefficacite de la gestion actuelle se traduit par:&#13;
- une degradation prematuree de l'ensemble du reseau routier due a une politique&#13;
d'entretien inadaptee, et a l'insuffisance notoire des credits d'entretien courant et&#13;
periodique;&#13;
- une faiblesse marquee de productivite de la regie resultant d'une mauvaise utilisation&#13;
des rares ressources disponibles (ressources humaines et moyens materiels);&#13;
- I'absence des conditions de mobilisation positive des PME en faveur du&#13;
developpement du sous-secteur;&#13;
- une gestion administrative lourde, exacerbee par les pratiques de gestion liees a&#13;
l'unicite de caisse;&#13;
..J14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
- l'insuffisance de coordination des differents intervenants dans le domaine des pistes&#13;
rurales et un gaspillage manifeste au niveau des investissements rarement entretenus;&#13;
- le mauvais etat, le faible taux de disponibilite et les defauts de gestion du materiel des&#13;
travaux publics.&#13;
TransRorts routier et securite routiere&#13;
Les principaux problemes releves des transports routiers togolais resultent:&#13;
- des contr6les administratifs multiples sur les routes exerces par plusieurs institutions&#13;
occasionnant des arrets fr6quents et prelevements indus mettant en peril financier les&#13;
operateurs. Ce mode de controle a favorise le non respect de la reglementation et la&#13;
disaffection de l'assurance obligatoire pour les operateurs;&#13;
- d'une regulation inadequate (tarification, tours de chargement dans les gares et au&#13;
port, etc.) empechant l1emergence de societes structurees offrant une bonne qualite de&#13;
service;&#13;
- du niveau eleve du risque d'accidents de la circulation (par rapport au faible taux de&#13;
motorisation du pays) dua a l'inobservation du code de la route par les conducteurs et a&#13;
l'etat defectueux des routes et a l'absence de controle technique adequat des vehicules&#13;
en fonctionnement;&#13;
- de l'absence d'equipements collectifs amrnages (gare routieres, parkings, etc.) pour&#13;
l'accueil des operateurs et des usagers.&#13;
Transport maritime et zestion Dortuaire&#13;
La politique de transport maritime adoptee jusqu'alors s'avere inadequate suite:&#13;
- a la repartition du trafic maritime suivant les accords de la CNUCED (regle des 40/&#13;
40 / 20) qui engendre une gestion monopolistique des droits de trafic, par le CNCT, a&#13;
travers le Comite Portuaire, et des surtarifs rencherissant les produits importes ainsi&#13;
que les produits togolais a 1'exportation;&#13;
- a la situation financiere catastrophique de la SOTONAM malgr6 les privileges dont&#13;
elle jouit en matiere de repartition de trafic (75%).&#13;
Port Autonome de Lome&#13;
Au niveau du Port Autonome de Lome, on note un tres bon niveau de securite offert aux&#13;
operateurs, une politique commerciale active et une restructuration des effectifs des dockers&#13;

DESCRIPTION DETAILLEE DES COMPOSANTES&#13;
Composante A : Entretien et Gestion du Reseau Routier&#13;
Objectifs de la composante&#13;
1.    Cette composante a pour objectifs de reduire les couits de transport et d'ameliorer la&#13;
competitivite du corridor de transit togolais grace a la rehabilitation et l'entretien du reseau routier&#13;
national afin d'ameliorer son etat de fonctionnement. Un objectif subsidiaire et non moins important&#13;
est le desenclavement des zones de production agricole pour promouvoir les activites rurales.&#13;
Description du contenu&#13;
2.    Cette composante comprend des travaux inclus dans le programme prioritaire 1997-2002,&#13;
constitu6 d'operations d'entretien periodique et de rehabilitation de premiere priorite sur les routes&#13;
rev8tues et les routes classees non revetues. La justification economique a ete prouvee (Benefice&#13;
Net Actualise positif et Taux de Rentabilite Interne -TRI- superieur a 12 %). Les travaux routiers&#13;
d'entretien periodique et de rehabilitation a financer par le credit de l'IDA dans le cadre du&#13;
programme prioritaire comprendront:&#13;
pour les routes rev8tues:&#13;
*  Ia r6habilitation des sections les plus degrad6es (105 km) sur 1 ou 2 troncons de I'axe Nord-&#13;
Sud (soit environ 15 % de l'ensemble de I'axe nord-sud en cas de non intervention des autres&#13;
bailleurs de fonds): sections Attakpame-Blitta ou Lome- Notse.&#13;
*  le rattrapage du retard d'entretien sur l'ensemble du reseau bitume permettant de proceder, en&#13;
deux ans, au rebouchage de tous les nids de poule et de prevenir la degradation acceleree du&#13;
reseau en attendant les travaux de rehabilitation ou d'entretien periodique prevus au&#13;
Programme.&#13;
pour les routes class6es non rev8tues:&#13;
*  la rehabilitation de l'ensemble du reseau national non revetu par l'elimination des points&#13;
critiques. Est concerne  'ensemble des sections du reseau ne'cessitant de tels travaux (sauf la&#13;
sectionAfagnagan-Agome Glozou ayant un TRI&lt;12%) soit 916 km sur les 1440 km de routes&#13;
nationales non revetues (64 %): 58 km en Region Maritime, 200 km dans la Region des&#13;

Page 2 of 16&#13;
Plateaux, 173 km en Region Centrale, 267 km dans la Region de Kara et 218 km dans la&#13;
Region des Savanes;&#13;
* la rehabilitation des ouvrages d'art et des ouvrages hydrauliques sur les routes nationales en&#13;
terre;&#13;
* le rattrapage du retard en entretien periodique par rechargement en laterite sur les sections&#13;
prioritaires du reseau national soit 517 km (priorite 1 et 2 voir Tableau C-2 et Annexe E) qui&#13;
se divisent en 120 km en Region Maritime, 240 km dans la Region des Plateaux, 85 km en&#13;
Region Centrale, 72 km dans la Region de Kara et 0 km dans la Region des Savanes. Le reste&#13;
du reseau sera finance par une contribution du FER, de la CFD et d'autres bailleurs de fonds.&#13;
3.    Construction des peages routiers. II est prevu, dans le cadre de l'augmentation des&#13;
ressources du FER, de developper les peages routiers sur le reseau revetu au fur et a mesure de leur&#13;
rehabilitation. Des etudes de faisabilit6 sont prevues dans le cadre de ce projet (composante&#13;
renforcement institutionnelle) qui permettront de definir les meilleurs emplacements pour la mise en&#13;
place de ces peages, la date optimale de mise en oeuvre et les amenagements necessaires pour la&#13;
construction des postes de p6age. Apres finalisation de ces etudes, les travaux seront inclus dans le&#13;
programme prioritaire routier, trois postes a peages seront finances par le credit IDA. Les etudes&#13;
techniques pour la construction des postes de peages sont egalement incluses dans la composante&#13;
renforcement institutionnel.&#13;
4.    Etudes et controle. Les etudes techniques et le contr6le des travaux realis6s dans le cadre de&#13;
cette composante, y compris les etudes d'impact des travaux sur l'environnement, seront confies a&#13;
des bureaux d'etudes dans le cadre de contrats passes conformement aux regles de l'IDA et seront&#13;
finances par le credit. Le projet comprend d'autres etudes et des audits lies au reseau national,&#13;
presentes dans la composante B renforcement institutionnel.&#13;
5.    Le Tableau C-3 consigne la liste detaillee des tron,ons des routes nationales du reseau&#13;
rev&amp;tu et le Tableau C-2 ceux du reseau non revetu faisant partie des investissements physiques du&#13;
programme 1997-2002. Ces tableaux donnent les principales caracteristiques des troncons&#13;
(notamment longueur et trafic supporte) ainsi que la date optimale et le couit des travaux proposes;&#13;
les resultats de l'analyse economique se trouvent dans l'annexe E (TRI, NPV). Le Tableau C. I&#13;
presente la synthese des cofits de la composante dont une partie correspond a la tranche des travaux&#13;
decrits ci-dessus et dont le financement est prevu par le credit.&#13;
Organisation institutionnelle pour la mise en oeuvre&#13;
6.    Cette composante sera g6ree par la DGTP qui assure la responsabilite de 1' ensemble du&#13;
projet. Le processus de mise en vigueur sera le suivant:&#13;
la Direction Generale des Travaux Publics (DGTP), agence d'execution chargee de la&#13;
programmation et de la bonne execution des travaux routiers sera responsable de la&#13;
mise en auvre des etudes, controles et travaux programmes dans cette composante. Elle&#13;
assurera toute la procedure de passation des marches dans le cadre des nouvelles&#13;
procedures de passation de march6s retenues pour l'execution du projet et des travaux&#13;
fmances par le FER.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

* le FER sera le principal bailleur de fonds pour les travaux d'entretien routier en&#13;
finan9ant d'une part une partie de la contrepartie des travaux d'entretien periodique sur&#13;
routes non revetues finances par l'IDA et d'autre part la totalite de l'entretien courant&#13;
du reseau a charge de la DGTP,&#13;
* les entreprises privees nationales et internationales assureront en principe l'execution de&#13;
la totalite des travaux d'entretien routier sous le controle de la DGTP, a l'exception des&#13;
travaux en regie sous contrats (entretien courant manuel par des cantonniers). Les&#13;
travaux de rehabilitation seront executes sur appel d'offre international.&#13;
7.    En tant que responsable de la mise en ceuvre de la composante, la DGTP assurera le suivi et&#13;
l'evaluation du deroulement de l'ensemble des activites qui s'y rapportent, y compris celles&#13;
concemant l'appui technique au FER, par la mise en place d'un systeme de suivi comportant des&#13;
indicateurs de suivi administratif, physique et financier. La DGTP assurera la passation des march6s&#13;
et la gestion des contrats correspondants selon la procedure decrite dans le Manuel de Mise en&#13;
Oeuvre (MMO).&#13;
8.    La DGTP adoptera les documents types de passation des marches et les contrats standards&#13;
convenus lors des negociations du projet. La contrepartie du gouvemement sera deposee dans un&#13;
compte projet gere par le FER. Des versements trimestriels seront operes par la Tresorerie Generale,&#13;
versements correspondants a des avances sur les depenses programmees pour le trimestre qui suit.&#13;
9.    Au 31 octobre de chaque annee, la DGTP preparera l'actualisation du programme de&#13;
rehabilitation et d'entretien du reseau national pour les cinq prochaines annees ainsi que le&#13;
programme des travaux prioritaires pour l'annee qui suit. Ce programme sera soumis pour avis a&#13;
l'IDA avant sa transmission pour approbation au Conseil des Routes, organe de gestion et de&#13;
decision du FER.&#13;

23.   La construction et l'equipement d'un Centre de Contr6le Technique Automobile a&#13;
Lome constitue un element important pour le contr6le de l'etat des vehicules et la reduction&#13;
des accidents dus a des defaillances mecaniques. La construction de ce centre a ete prevue&#13;
dans le programme de securite routiere etablit en 1990 et dont la realisation a ete retard6e&#13;
faute de structure adequate pour sa gestion. Le site d'implantation est deja retenu et les&#13;
dossiers d'appel d'offre sont quasiment prepares. La programmation de l'investissement est&#13;
prevue pour les deux premi&amp;res annees du projet. Les etudes techniques et le controle des&#13;
travaux realises dans le cadre de cette composante seront confies a des bureaux d'etudes dans&#13;
le cadre de contrats passes conformement aux regles de 1'IDA et seront finances par le cr6dit.&#13;
24.   Les actions d'appui institutionnel visent a consolider les acquis du Projet de&#13;
Rehabilitation des Transports. Elles porteront sur: (i) des etudes d'amelioration de la securite&#13;
et des conditions de transports, (ii) la consolidation du systeme de collecte et de traitement&#13;
des accidents de la route, (iii) la fornation des formateurs d'auto-ecole et des examinateurs&#13;
de permis de conduire et (iv) des campagnes de prevention routiere aupres du grand public et&#13;
de sensibilisation dans les etablissements scolaires. Elles comprendront donc trois volets, a&#13;
savoir les etudes, l'assistance technique et logistique, et la formation.&#13;
25.   Les etudes concerneront les solutions d'amenagement des points noirs de l'axe RN1&#13;
et quelques carrefours reputes dangereux dans la ville de Lome. Ces amenagements seront&#13;
6tudies dans le cadre des etudes techniques necessaires a la rehabilitation de l'axe Nord-Sud.&#13;
26.   L'assistance/formation sera apportee dans le domaine de: (a) l'amelioration de la&#13;
collecte et le traitement des donnees d'accidents de la circulation routiere avec l'intervention&#13;
d'un expert en gestion de bases de donnees informatisees pour 4 homme-mois assiste d'un&#13;
specialiste d'enquetes pour 3 homme-mois pour l'etablissement d'un formulaire de releves&#13;
d'accidents pour la police, l'informatisation du fichier central de la gendarmerie, la mise au&#13;
point d'un registre au niveau des centres hospitaliers, et la formation du personnel, (b)&#13;
l'organisation des campagnes de prevention routiere aupres du grand public et de&#13;
sensibilisation dans les etablissements scolaires, (c) des stages pour la formation des&#13;
formateurs d'auto-ecole et des examinateurs de permis de conduire, et (d) l'appui au&#13;
demarrage de l'office de securite routiere (OSR) qui sera cree pour la gestion de la securite&#13;
routiere, incluant l'exploitation du centre de controle technique des vehicules (4 homme-&#13;
mois).&#13;
Les cofits de mise en oeuvre de cette composante sont resumes dans le Tableau C-5, ci-apres.&#13;
Organisation institutionnelle pour la mise en oeuvre&#13;
27.   Pour beneficier de la delegation de passation des marches au MMETPT, la DGTP&#13;
assurera la construction du CCTA (gestion des contrats) et le traitement des points noirs dans&#13;
le cadre des travaux routiers. Les travaux seront realises par des entreprises selon des&#13;
procedures d'appels a la concurrence acceptables par l'IDA. La mise au point du dossier&#13;
d'appel d'offres du CCTA et des specifications des equipements necessaires sera assuree par&#13;
la DGT. Le programme de securite routiere sera initie par la DGT. Ce programme sera&#13;
elabore conformement a la politique du gouvemement en matiere de securite routiere. Son&#13;
adoption et la supervision de sa mise en oeuvre sont du ressort du Conseil National de&#13;
&#13;

Securite Routiere (CNSR - organe de coordination et de participation a l'echelle nationale qui&#13;
sera institu6 avant le demarrage du projet). Des son etablissement, l'OSR prendra en charge&#13;
l'execution du programme adopte par le CNSR. L'OSR etablira des rapports trimestriels&#13;
indiquant l'etat d'avancement de l'execution du programme, qui seront transmis au SET, au&#13;
CNSR et a 1'IDA. Au mois de novembre de chaque annee, l'OSR actualisera le programme&#13;
de base en fonction des realisations effectives et proposera le contenu des activites de l'annde&#13;
qui suit, a l'adoption du CNSR et a la revue de l'IDA. L'OSR assurera egalement&#13;
l'exploitation du CCTA dans le cadre d'une concession qui lui sera attribuee par le&#13;
MMETPT. La decision de creation de l'OSR, organe autonome de gestion de la securite&#13;
routiere, doit etre prise (adoption du decret de creation) avant les negociations du present&#13;
projet. L'engagement des autorites togolaises sur l'exploitation du CCTA par l'OSR est une&#13;
condition de decaissement du projet au profit de cette composante.&#13;
28.    En tant que responsable de la mise en mzuvre de l'ensemble du programme , la DGTP&#13;
assurera le suivi et l'evaluation du deroulement de l'ensemble des activites de cette&#13;
composante, par la mise en place d'un systeme de suivi comportant des indicateurs de suivi&#13;
administratif, physique et financier en etroite collaboration avec la DGT, la DTR et l'OSR&#13;
suivant les modalites definies dans la Manuel de Mise en Oeuvre du Programme.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESMENT&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Executive summary&#13;
1.         The project will aim at rehabilitating Togo's main road and rural&#13;
roads network and setting the bases for its long term maintenance. Since no&#13;
new roads will be opened up in the framework of the project, the expected&#13;
environmental impacts will be milder than in the case of new roads. In addition,&#13;
the project will encourage labor intensive road maintenance activities that are&#13;
generally more environmentally friendly than highly mechanized activities. An&#13;
environmental assessment has been undertaken, during which 1.700 km of&#13;
roads have been observed in all ecological areas of the country, consultations&#13;
have been undertaken with rural and urban populations affected by road&#13;
rehabilitation initiatives, and all key administrative bodies have been contacted.&#13;
Field observations revealed that the project will have minor&#13;
negative environmental impacts that can be easily mitigated. The dirt roads&#13;
are in acceptable condition, which will only require mild rehabilitation by&#13;
resurfacing and eliminating critical points. The tarred roads are in variable&#13;
conditions, certain tracks will require heavy rehabilitation in the short term.&#13;
On a social standpoint, the consultative approach that has been retained for&#13;
the rehabilitation of rural roads will ensure that the needs of the rural people&#13;
will be taken into account when selecting rural roads to be rehabilitated.&#13;
2.    The main environmental impacts and the accompanying mitigation&#13;
measures will be:&#13;
*     Laterite quarries that are opened up along the roads and that, if not&#13;
rehabilitated after use, could induce erosion and standing waters. The&#13;
rehabilitation of these areas is technically straighfforward and easily&#13;
implemented. On a case by case approach, these quarries may be&#13;
restored by leveling the grounds and spreading back organic soil on the&#13;
area, vegetative cover may then be restored through tree planting or&#13;
grass propagation. In other cases, laterite quarries may be transformed&#13;
into water reservoirs that would greatly benefit the local populations.&#13;
Wetlands may be harmed by road crossing and ineffective road drainage&#13;
infrastructure, this may lead to an imbalance of fragile ecosystems, loss&#13;
of agricultural land used during the dry season, and eutrophication of&#13;
certain water bodies, in addition to ecological losses due to the&#13;
degradation of the ecosystems. The project will improve drainage&#13;
infrastructure, which will result in the restoration of the original water&#13;
transfers that naturally regulate wetlands.&#13;
The drainage of roads (runoff waters) sometimes leads to the&#13;
accelerated formation of gullies and to erosion alongside the roads. It&#13;
has generally been observed that the present drainage infrastructure&#13;
carries water to areas with adequate vegetative cover and that erosion is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
generally not exacerbated by road drainage.  Guidelines include&#13;
provisions for improving the downstream portion of road drainage&#13;
systems.&#13;
Atmospheric pollution linked to road rehabilitation and maintenance is&#13;
very low and negligible compared to other sources of air pollution such&#13;
as general passenger and freight vehicles traffic. The main problem at&#13;
present is the dust generated by major rehabilitation works which can&#13;
cause discomfort and health hazards to local populations, as well as&#13;
mild damage to nearby crops or natural vegetation. This is easily&#13;
controlled by frequent watering of construction sites which is already&#13;
widely practiced by road construction companies.&#13;
*    The destruction of human habitat is rarely a problem. In the few cases&#13;
where households had to be evicted, compensation measures not&#13;
satisfactory. Population displacement will not take place under this&#13;
project.&#13;
3.         In urban an peri-urban zones environmental impacts and&#13;
mitigation measures are the following:&#13;
The limited infiltration surface that characterizes urban areas increases&#13;
the risks of flooding, especially when taking into consideration the almost&#13;
level topography of the major cities of southern Togo.   The&#13;
reconstruction of urban drainage infrastructure, their maintenance, and&#13;
the paving instead of tarring of roads, all undertaken within the project,&#13;
greatly improve the water drainage situation in urban areas.&#13;
*    Atmospheric pollution issues are more serious in urban areas due to the&#13;
density of traffic, the large affected population, and the limited airflow&#13;
that characterizes them. Even more care is generally taken by road&#13;
construction companies in order to minimize dust displacement. Vehicle&#13;
emissions could be greatly diminished by instating vehicle pollution&#13;
standards and an inspection system. The latter problem is further&#13;
exacerbated by the derelict mechanical state of most personal and&#13;
commercial vehicles, which in turn makes them more polluting. Instating&#13;
pollution standards and vehicle inspection are presently being&#13;
considered.&#13;
Habitat destruction and relocation of city dwellers will generally be&#13;
avoided in the project. Past experiences in Togo have shown that when&#13;
dwellings have to be destroyed, the levels of compensation are not&#13;
realistic. Recommendations for instating a better compensation systems&#13;
have been made in the study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
4.         In the framework of the implementation of the national&#13;
environmental action plan, Togo has just prepared an environmental law that&#13;
includes environmental impact assessment requirements and the need do&#13;
develop sectoral environmental guidelines. In this respect, the project will be&#13;
on the forefront since it will propose the first set of sectoral environmental&#13;
guidelines developed in, jointly with the public works administration and other&#13;
concerned administrations.&#13;
5.         Institutional coordination will be very important in order to&#13;
implement environmental guidelines.  In this respect, the newly created&#13;
Togolese Ministry of Environment will play a key role, coordinating the&#13;
administrative bodies in charge of public works, rural development, forestry,&#13;
and urban management. At present, the organizational chart and the mandate&#13;
of the Ministry of Environment are not clearly defined, it is thus difficult to&#13;
assess the capabilities of this institution to play its role. In the meantime, it is&#13;
recommended that the leading institution in terms of monitoring environmental&#13;
issues related to road rehabilitation and maintenance be the general directorate&#13;
for public works.&#13;
The environmental impact assessment of the project has also&#13;
presented a conceptual framework for undertaking the necessary&#13;
environmental impact assessments and the corresponding mitigation plans&#13;
related to future road rehabilitation and maintenance works. In addition, an&#13;
environmental directive for the directorate of roads has been developed (see&#13;
following section). Since environmental concerns will be part of the "cahier des&#13;
charges" submitted to companies in order to prepare bids, the likelihood of&#13;
adequate treatment of environmental concerns is greatly increased by the&#13;
project. Never the less, a concise environmental training program for the&#13;
technicians of the directorate of roads and the directorate of rural roads has&#13;
been planned for.&#13;
The risks associated with environmental considerations of the&#13;
project are:&#13;
* the general lack of environmental awareness among the staff of the&#13;
general directorate of public works&#13;
* the present lack of efficient institutional framework for environment&#13;
* a generalized lack of social concern in development projects in Togo&#13;
In order to minimize these risks; it is necessary that the project&#13;
include the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
* to undertake a practical training program for selected members of the&#13;
general directorate of public works related to mainstreaming environmenta!&#13;
issues in road rehabilitation initiatives;&#13;
* to set up an environmental desk within the general directorate of public&#13;
works that will monitor environmental impact assessments, both for main&#13;
roads and rural roads,&#13;
* to adopt the environmental directive of the general directorate of public&#13;
works&#13;
* to elaborate an environmental handbook to help the staff of the general&#13;
directorate of public works consider environmental issues and elaborate&#13;
mitigation plans; and&#13;
* to elaborate and adopt a clear set of guidelines to compensate social&#13;
groups that would be negatively affected by certain types of road&#13;
rehabilitation works.&#13;

ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
This annex summarizes the results of the economic evaluation for all works included in the priority road&#13;
program, with detailed justification for works on the earth and paved network that are proposed for IDA&#13;
financing. At the end of the annex, there is a listing of all road works included in the priority program as of&#13;
December 1996, including traffic, length, costs, net present value and Economic rate of return where&#13;
available.&#13;
PAVED ROADS&#13;
(COMPONENT A)&#13;
Methodology&#13;
1.    The economic evaluation for paved road sections included in the project used the&#13;
Highway Design Model (HDM) to define an optimal maintenance strategy from among&#13;
20 different, locally-tailored strategies. For a given road and set of maintenance works,&#13;
the model simulates the aging of the road and links it to costs of maintenance and vehicle.&#13;
In this way, different strategies may be compared to each other, and to a "without-&#13;
project" case, and an optimal strategy may be defined through cost/benefit analysis, even&#13;
assuming a drop in available resources. For the purpose of this analysis, 20 possible&#13;
maintenance strategies were classified by decreasing Net Present Value (NPV), which&#13;
corresponds to classification by decreasing maintenance cost . An optimal strategy can&#13;
be selected for different funding scenarios from this classification. Economic cost and&#13;
benefit were discounted over a 20-year period at a 12 percent discount rate.&#13;
Data&#13;
2.    Road data, such as International Roughness Index (IRI), length, deflections, type&#13;
of construction, and assessment of general condition, were collected in the field when not&#13;
already available. The IRI, evaluating road surface condition, is the basic element of the&#13;
HDM. The HDM calculates IRI evolution over time for a given maintenance strategy,&#13;
and mathematically links IRI to the Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC). In 1995, the average&#13;
IRI (5.1 m/km) indicated that Togo's paved roads were in mediocre condition, although&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 2 of 16&#13;
the situation varies over the network. Four types of construction, each with distinct&#13;
technical perfonnance, were identified in the Togolese paved network.&#13;
3.    Traffic. Routine DGTP traffic counts provided most of the relevant data, however&#13;
additional traffic counts were carried out to confirm available data or to determine daily&#13;
traffic levels on roads for which no data existed. Annual traffic growth over the next 20&#13;
years was determined from data such as annual traffic growth over the last 10 years, fuel&#13;
consumption, and growth in general and per capita GNP. Two categories of vehicle (cars&#13;
and trucks) were considered for the HDM simulation. Table E. 1 lists annual traffic&#13;
growth used in the economic evaluation.&#13;

4.    Maintenance costs were derived from recent rehabilitation and routine&#13;
maintenance works either undertaken by DGTP, or contracted out to intemational and&#13;
local contractors.&#13;
Maintenance strategies&#13;
5.    Definition of maintenance strategies for the economic evaluation. A&#13;
maintenance strategy consists of a set of maintenance works. Three types of maintenance&#13;
works normally pertain to paved roads: (a) rehabilitation, double-layer pavement with&#13;
various materials; (b) periodic maintenance, single-layer paving with various materials;&#13;
and (c) routine maintenance: (i) resealing (rarely considered for the Togolese network);&#13;
(ii) pothole patching; (iii) maintenance of the road shoulders. A maintenance strategy&#13;
may be a combination of any of these types of maintenance.&#13;
6.    The twenty strategies considered for this evaluation all had the following elements&#13;
in common. Periodic maintenance works were assumed to begin in 1997, to allow&#13;
adequate time to mobilize external resources. All strategies contained basic routine&#13;
maintenance on selected road sections consisting of patching 50 percent of potholes and&#13;
shoulder maintenance (see also the sensitivity analysis below). The "without-strategy"&#13;
case consists of shoulder maintenance alone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 3 of 16&#13;
7.    Classifications of strategies by type of road construction and traffic level.&#13;
The 20 strategies were classified by decreasing economic return for every possible&#13;
combination of construction method and traffic level. The NPV provides the most&#13;
valuable economic criteria for rating the strategies, representing the savings in VOC and&#13;
maintenance costs between a given strategy and the "without-project" case. For this&#13;
evaluation, the flow of saving was discounted at 12 percent over 20 years. A per&#13;
kilometer NPV for each of the 20 strategies was assessed using the HDM for each&#13;
combination of traffic level and road construction method, to classify maintenance&#13;
strategies by decreasing economic return (decreasing NPV). Strategies thus classified&#13;
also reflect decreasing maintenance cost.&#13;
8.    Application of the strategies to the paved network. Seven scenarios were&#13;
computed using HDM that considered different maintenance strategies for each paved&#13;
road, given construction type and traffic level. These scenarios correspond to the first&#13;
seven of the 20 classified strategies, in order of decreasing economic return and&#13;
maintenance cost.&#13;

9.    Results of the economic evaluation, optimal strategy and strategy with a&#13;
budget constraint. The economic evaluation indicates the different road maintenance&#13;
strategies that are acceptable from both an engineering and an economic perspective;&#13;
ERRs for the seven scenarios remain between 350 percent and 490 percent. The best&#13;
adapted strategy may therefore be chosen for given available resources. Two scenarios&#13;
are presented in this annex: the first is the optimal strategy (no budget constraint, first&#13;
scenario), the second is the strategy with a budget constraint, reflecting available&#13;
maintenance resources in Togo (sixth scenario). Table E.3 presents the economic&#13;
indicators (NPV, discounted maintenance cost and ERR) for these scenarios over the&#13;
entire network (see also Table E.9 and Table E. 10). In the strategy with budget constraint&#13;
maintenance costs were cut nearly in half (CFAF 66 billion to 37.4 billion) while NPV&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 4 of 16&#13;
and the ERR remain quite high. Table E. 11 presents the economic indicators for the&#13;
paved roads in the program.&#13;
10.   The paved road priority program was initially derived from the economic&#13;
evaluation. However, final maintenance strategies for specific sections of road also take&#13;
into account actual road conditions (level of deterioration), and appropriate technical&#13;
maintenance standards. As presented in Table C-3 (annex C) , the project applies either&#13;
the optimal strategy or the strategy with a budget constraint to each paved road included&#13;
in the project.&#13;

Sensitivity analysis&#13;
11.   It is important to analyze the impact of defaulting on routine maintenance,&#13;
especially if the country's patching capacity turns out to be limited. The sensitivity&#13;
analysis examined two other maintenance strategies, using the same methodology as in&#13;
the base case, that respectively assume patching of 20 percent and 100 percent of&#13;
potholes. Economic indicators are presented in Table E.4. The analysis shows that&#13;
decreasing the percentage of potholes patched every year has a negative economic&#13;
impact. The overall discounted maintenance cost would increase by 13 percent and the&#13;
NPV would increase by 8.5 percent. However, the ERR would remain high due to the&#13;
current level of network deterioration.&#13;

EARTH ROADS&#13;
(COMPONENTS A)&#13;
Methodology&#13;
12.   A different methodology was used to determine an optimal maintenance strategy&#13;
for the unpaved road network. The main objective of this methodology was to optimize&#13;
allocation of road maintenance resources in order to maximize the number of passable&#13;
itineraries. Under this methodology, maintenance activities for each road section must be&#13;
tailored to actual traffic levels, terrain and weather conditions to determine the service&#13;
level that optimizes the overall balance between user cost savings and maintenance costs.&#13;
Thus, the optimal strategy was based on empirical evidence of road deterioration at given&#13;
traffic and maintenance levels, and on maintenance experience and observations of earth&#13;
road conditions in Togo and neighboring countries with a similar road network. The&#13;
optimal maintenance strategy will minimize the present value of the aggregate net&#13;
maintenance cost for each road section. The net cost on a given section is defined as the&#13;
difference between the cost of maintenance (routine and periodic), and the user costs for&#13;
vehicles using the road section; the Net Present Value (NPV) of the annual stream of net&#13;
costs is calculated over 20 years at a 12 percent discount rate.&#13;
Road and Traffic data&#13;
13.   Data was collected on the entire national unpaved network. An annual inspection&#13;
campaign collected information on the precise length and width of roads, average speed&#13;
of travel over these roads, and existing trouble spots. Traffic data were collected either&#13;
by actual counts (June - July 1995) or by extrapolating from the latest counts. Annual&#13;
traffic growth is estimated at 3 percent for trucks, and 2 percent for cars, and was&#13;
calculated from annual traffic growth rates on representative Togolese roads, vehicle fleet&#13;
growth rates, and expected economic growth. The evaluation does not include&#13;
projections for traffic growth induced by road upgrading, and is therefore rather&#13;
conservative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 6 of 16&#13;
14.   Vehicle Operating Costs. Basic data were collected in Lome. Vehicle operating&#13;
costs were calculated with HDM for four different types of vehicles and five different&#13;
representative road surface conditions (measured by IRI). The HDM was adapted to&#13;
reflect local characteristics, such as percentage of used cars, average life of vehicles, and&#13;
road conditions. All costs are net of taxes and relate to constant 1995 prices.&#13;
15.   Cost of Works. Costs are based on those observed in private contract execution.&#13;
Unit costs used in the evaluation were determined in June 1995 from recently awarded&#13;
works contracts and from a survey of enterprises. The economic cost of periodic&#13;
maintenance includes all necessary works to prepare the road surface (initial grading of&#13;
the roadbed, regraveling at 15 cm), which totals an estimated CFAF 5,100 per cubic&#13;
meter of material used. All costs are net of taxes and reflect constant 1995 prices.&#13;
Optimal Maintenance Strategy&#13;
16.   To define an economically optimal maintenance policy for the national earth road&#13;
network, it is necessary to deternine: (a) the desired average level of service between&#13;
periodic maintenance works; (b) the sequencing of routine and periodic maintenance&#13;
works; (c) economic indicators for the optimal strategy; and (d) a fallback maintenance&#13;
strategy in case insufficient resources are available for road maintenance. These steps are&#13;
summarized below.&#13;
17.   Definition of Service Levels on Maintainable Earth Roads. Five service levels&#13;
ranging from "excellent" to "very poor" were identified, each corresponding to a&#13;
measurable road condition (IRI). The five service levels (niveau de service or NS) and the&#13;
corresponding roughness values are as follows:&#13;
NS5 = excellent    (IRI = 4 to 6)&#13;
NS4 = good         (IRI = 6 to 10)&#13;
NS3 = fair         (IRI = 10 to 16)&#13;
NS2 = poor         (IRI = 16 to 20)&#13;
NS 1, very poor    (IRI = 20 to 24)&#13;
The current service level of each earth road section was assessed in an inspection&#13;
campaign during Transport Sector Strategy preparation. Roads with permanent trouble&#13;
spots were ranked NS 1. HDM establishes the functional relationship between service&#13;
level and vehicle operating costs allowing VOC to be computed for each of the five&#13;
service levels.&#13;
18.   Impact of Maintenance on Service Level. Maintenance of earth roads includes:&#13;
(a) tasks that do not vary with service level (manual routine shoulder and drainage system&#13;
clearing (cantonnage) ); and (b) tasks that affect service level (routine patching (point el&#13;
temps), grading and periodic regraveling). Rainfall has an impact on manual routine&#13;
maintenance needs, and soil sensitivity to water has an impact on regraveling needs.&#13;
Analysis of roads that have not been maintained for the last few years has helped&#13;
determine the impact on earth road roughness, and hence on service levels, periodic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 7 of 16&#13;
regraveling and different routine maintenance approaches at different traffic levels,&#13;
during the intervals between periodic regraveling. Table E. 12 shows the minimum&#13;
routine maintenance required to sustain a given service level. Table E. 13 indicates the&#13;
minimum frequency of regraveling in years required to maintain a given service level&#13;
over a longer period of time based on the observation that 2.5 mm of roadbed disappears&#13;
on every grading.&#13;
19.   Optimizing net maintenance cost. The most economic level of service has been&#13;
determined for each traffic level. Each traffic level generated a curve showing the overall&#13;
economic cost per km (net present value of VOC plus maintenance cost, over 20 years,&#13;
discounted at 12 percent) as a function of road maintenance costs. Table E.14 gives the&#13;
resultant determination of optimal maintenance activities by traffic, service level, and&#13;
modal split. In the short to medium term, NS4 (good) will be the highest service level on&#13;
the most heavily traveled earth roads. Total maintenance costs were estimated for the&#13;
entire earth network using the relationship between service level and maintenance&#13;
activities developed in the preceding paragraphs. Total estimated annual routine and total&#13;
periodic maintenance program costs are shown in Table E. 15 and Table E. 16. The total&#13;
annual cost of an economically optimal earth road maintenance program (net of taxes) on&#13;
all 1439 km of the earth network is about CFAF 4.1 billion for periodic maintenance&#13;
during the next five years, and CFAF 1 billion for routine maintenance.&#13;
Elimination of Trouble Spots and Drainage Repairs&#13;
20.   On the national earth roads included in the project, trouble spots were recorded&#13;
and ranked by level of passability (both during the rainy season and year-round), and by&#13;
type of problem (i.e. muddy area, broken bridge, submersion). Table E.5 shows a&#13;
summary of the classification by gravity of trouble spot. The project will redress all&#13;
trouble spots recorded in order to ensure passability on the road network throughout the&#13;
year. Since the viability of the national earth road network requires that all section be&#13;
passable at all times of the year, at least trouble spots in categories 1, 2 and 3 must be&#13;
eliminated.&#13;

Economic Evaluation - Base Case and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
21.   Two main cases were analyzed in the evaluation: (a) a base case with road&#13;
maintenance corresponding to the optimal maintenance strategy, as defined above; (b) a&#13;
sensitivity case, based on the assumption that road maintenance resources are insufficient&#13;
to realize the optimal maintenance program, aiming at a service level of NS3 (fair) on all&#13;
roads. ERRs have been determined for all priority program works (elimination of trouble&#13;
spots, rehabilitation of drainage structures, routine and periodic maintenance) on each&#13;
road section, in each of the two cases. Other sensitivity analyses tested how economic&#13;
results vary if the traffic decreases by 20 or 30 percent and investment costs increase by&#13;
20 or 30 percent.&#13;
22.   "Without project" scenario. Expenditures on earth roads are economically&#13;
justified when the evolution of the network without the project is considered. The&#13;
"without project" scenario assumes no investments, however includes minor operations,&#13;
such as roadside and drainage clearing, to maintain passability during the rainy season on&#13;
the most deteriorated sections. Aside from these priority sections, the rest of the network&#13;
would continue to degrade. The evolution of service levels in the "without project"&#13;
scenario is presented in Table E.6, assuming average Togolese weather conditions and&#13;
traffic composition of 10 percent heavy trucks.&#13;

23.   Economic indicators in the base case. Table E.7 summarizes the assumptions&#13;
and the results of the economic evaluation of the project for the base case, and shows the&#13;
following: (a) the optimal maintenance strategy produces a high global economic return;&#13;
and (b) two itineraries show ERRs less than 12 percent. Traffic on these roads is less&#13;
than 15 vehicles per day, and the investment is high with respect to VOC savings. These&#13;
itineraries will not be considered in the priority program (1997-2002). The results of the&#13;
economic evaluation for each itinerary and for the two scenarios above are given in Table&#13;
E. 17. This table presents the length and traffic for each of the 51 road sections analyzed:&#13;
(a) the cost of periodic maintenance (regraveling); (b) the cost for elimination of trouble&#13;
spots and drainage repairs; and (c) the net present value for the base case and the ERR of&#13;
the two cases.&#13;

Definition of level of priority among the earth roads.&#13;
24.    The ERR and traffic level provide objective criteria to prioritize among earth&#13;
roads included in the priority program. Five levels of priority were defined for national&#13;
earth roads and 4 for rural roads. See Table E.8 and Table E. 16 for further details.&#13;

Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
25.   The sensitivity analysis looked at the influence of: (a) service level to be reached;&#13;
(b) traffic levels and cost of works; and (c) a prioritization based on NPV rather than&#13;
ERR.&#13;
26.   Sensitivity to the service level to be reached. To accommodate limited&#13;
resources, a less demanding maintenance strategy was tested on the priority earth road&#13;
network. The goal of this strategy is to reach a NS3 service level (fair). The economic&#13;
evaluation, using the same methodology, proves that this strategy has also a high overall&#13;
Economic Rate of Return, though significantly lower than in the base case (see Table&#13;
E.7). Fifteen roads have an ERR below 4 percent. The annual routine maintenance&#13;
budget decreases by CFAF 442 million. The results by section are given in Table E. 17.&#13;
27.   Sensitivity to the traffic level and to the cost of works. Should the traffic level&#13;
on the unpaved network be 20 or 30 percent less than estimated in the base case&#13;
evaluation, the number of sections with an ERR of less than 12 percent rises from two to&#13;
three. In the base case, these three sections have an ERR less than 25 percent. Should&#13;
the cost of investment works on each road in the program be 20 or 30 percent higher&#13;
than expected in the base case evaluation, the same three sections have an ERR less than&#13;
12 percent (periodic maintenance costs are not affected by the change in cost of works).&#13;
These three sections therefore are considered a second priority, and warrant further&#13;
investigation during program implementation. The program establishing road priority&#13;
level is not affected noticeably by modification in these variables, provided that selection&#13;
criteria for each priority is adapted to the new data.&#13;
28.   Net Present Value (NPV). The NPV may also be used to rank the priority&#13;
program. The HDM used in the economic evaluation will compute the NPV for each&#13;
road included in the program. Roads may be ranked by decreasing NPV to prioritize&#13;
sections. The Net Present Value was estimated at two different discount rates (12 percent&#13;
and 20 percent). Results show that the discount rate has roughly no effect on road&#13;
ranking, but does affect the NPV itself. The NPV decreases from CFAF 59 billion to&#13;
CFAF 36 billion for the priority network. Two national earth roads have a negative NPV&#13;
at the 12 percent discount rate; this number rises to four under a 20 percent discount&#13;
rate. Three roads of the four roads have already been ranked in the paragraph above&#13;
29.   The level of priority is modified dramatically by selecting NPV rather than ERR.&#13;
Using a 12 percent discount rate and the NPV ranking, 12 national of the 51 national&#13;
earth roads shift priority level.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Road Transport Project, an
            International Development Agency (IDA) project will address
            the most important priorities of the Road Sector Investment
            Program (RSIP) to complement and reinforce IDA s ongoing
            assistance to support Togo s economic recovery and sustained
            growth. Specifically, the project will support operations to
            a) rehabilitate and maintain both national and rural roads;
            b) provide regular and stable road maintenance financing
            from local resources; c) encourage private sector
            involvement in subsector development; d) improve road
            safety; and e) revitalize and strengthen the management
            capacity of transport sector institutions. The IDA Credit
            will finance works, goods, and services for four components:
            1) remedial maintenance or rehabilitation and regraveling of
            the paved road network, critical sections of the rural road
            network, and the most important sections of the national
            unpaved network to improve their condition to a level
            facilitating sustainable maintenance; 2) institutional
            strengthening of public sector management capacity to
            improve sector coordination, investment planning and
            monitoring, road maintenance programming and implementation,
            and to facilitate private sector involvement in transport
            and public works; 3) road safety improvement, including
            building and equipping a vehicle inspection center,
            technical assistance and studies, collection and analysis of
            traffic accident data, school and public road safety
            campaigns, and training instructors and examiners; and 4)
            building mechanisms for beneficiary and community
            participation in rural road management capacity.
