1. BACKGROUND AND GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
1.1   Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), which occurs in all provinces of Indonesia, is a significant&#13;
and preventable risk factor affecting the quality of human resources. Its most important effects are&#13;
increased neonatal and infant mortality and reduced mental ability. As such it can be an important&#13;
factor limiting educational achievement and economic development.&#13;
1.2    Although iodine deficiency has been recognized in Indonesia since the 1 920s, it was not until&#13;
the 1980s that information was collected on a national scale in an attempt to determine the full&#13;
extent of the problem. Based on this information it was believed that approximately one-sixth of the&#13;
population was at risk of iodine deficiency. However, recent analysis by a GOI/Bank team indicates&#13;
that the size of the population at risk is much larger than was previously thought.' At least a third,&#13;
and possibly as much as one half of the population of Indonesia is at risk of iodine deficiency2. The&#13;
methodological limitations and age of the previous survey mean that it is unsuitable as the basis for&#13;
targeting programs or for use as a baseline against which to measure change. Further, there is a clear&#13;
indication that control efforts to date have not been successful. Recognizing these limitations and the&#13;
importance of iodine deficiency the GOI requested the Bank to collaborate in the development of a&#13;
project to strengthen its efforts to prevent iodine deficiency.&#13;
A.    ECONOMIC AND WELFARE IMPLICATIONS&#13;
1.3   The effects of iodine deficiency on human health and welfare can vary in severity. Still birth&#13;
and perinatal mortality rates are higher in iodine deficient areas. Deficiency in the first three months&#13;
of pregnancy increases the proportion of cretinous births. Whilst the importance of cretinism, a&#13;
syndrome characterized by severe retardation of mental and motor development, for the functioning&#13;
of the individual is obvious, of much broader importance is the evidence that even noncretinous&#13;
children born in areas where iodine deficiency is endemic may be mentally and neurologically&#13;
handicapped. Although this impairment, which is thought to be irreversible, may be mild, because it&#13;
effects a much larger proportion of the population it has important implications for the social and&#13;
economic development of these communities. Finally, recent studies in several countries have&#13;
indicated there may also be a component of mild mental retardation which is reversible when iodine&#13;
is given to children of school age.&#13;
1.4   Thus, the effects of iodine deficiency are diverse, ranging from increased mortality through&#13;
severe disability to milder levels of impairment. There are difficulties in combining all these&#13;
sequelae in a single index of the effect of iodine deficiency on the community. One approach is to&#13;
Heywood and Jus'at (1995).&#13;
2 A population living in an area in which the prevalence of goiter is at least 10% is "at risk" of iodine deficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
calculate their contribution to the total "burden of disease and disability" (BOD), the concept used in&#13;
the Bank's World Development Report in 1993. The BOD is measured in terms of Disability&#13;
Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost. Each of the sequelae of iodine deficiency contributes to the&#13;
BOD. Estimates of the BOD in Indonesia due to IDD, shown in Table 1. I (see Annex I for details),&#13;
reveal IDD to be responsible for 27 DALYs per 1000 population per year - an important contributor&#13;
to the overall burden. The World Bank and WHO (World Bank, 1993; Murray and Lopez, 1994)&#13;
estimate the total burden due to all diseases in the "Other Asia and Islands" region (of which&#13;
Indonesia is the most populous member) to be 258 DALY per 1000 population per year. Thus,&#13;
assuming the total burden in Indonesia to be similar to that of the region as a whole, IDD contributes&#13;
of the order of 10 per cent to the total countrywide and as much as 20 percent in endemic areas.&#13;

Disability in normal population due to IDD                      4,495,375&#13;
Cretinism                                                         283,405&#13;
Neonatal deaths due to IDD                                        342,448&#13;
Total Burden due to IDD                                         5,121,228&#13;
Total IDD DALY per 1000 population (Indonesia)                        27&#13;
Total IDD DALY per 1000 population in endemic area                    51&#13;
1.5    Any single factor which contributes such a high proportion of the total burden of disease and&#13;
disability will effect economic development. In the case of iodine deficiency, the effects will occur&#13;
through limiting the returns on investment in education, premature mortality, mild and severe levels&#13;
of disability in adults and the resulting loss in productivity and wages, decreased inventiveness and&#13;
lower levels of risk taking and investment. The extent of these economic effects will depend on the&#13;
extent and severity of iodine deficiency, the quality of schooling available and the complexity and&#13;
novelty of the tasks required of the adults as economic development proceeds.&#13;
B.    EFFORTS TO CONTROL IODINE DEFICIENCY&#13;
1.6   As in many other Asian countries, a national IDD control program was initiated in the mid-&#13;
1970s with UNICEF support, and iodization of salt was initially seen as the main strategy. However,&#13;
the difficulties in establishing and monitoring iodization led to an early emphasis on injections of&#13;
iodized oil as a short term measure. Subsequent international pressure to reach unrealistic targets&#13;
resulted in continuing reliance on injected oil and a reduction in emphasis, until recently, on salt.&#13;
1.7   Iodized oil injections. Over the last 20 years the most sustained efforts to control iodine&#13;
deficiency have been through the use of iodized oil by the Ministry of Health (MOH). Unfortunately,&#13;
the effect of 20 years of iodized oil injections has been limited. The recent evaluation of the IDD&#13;
control program (Heywood and Jus'at, 1995) indicated that, based on Ministry of Health records, the&#13;
number of injections delivered since 1974 had kept pace with the increase in population but had not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
reduced the proportion of the population at risk. By the time iodized oil injections were phased out&#13;
they were still covering only approximately 7 per cent of the target population. Thus, it has become&#13;
increasingly clear that continued reliance on iodized oil injections as the primary means of control is&#13;
not feasible due to problems in the delivery and targeting of injections, the high cost of untargeted&#13;
delivery and the role of reuse of needles in transmission of hepatitis B and HIV.&#13;
1.8   Iodized oil capsules. These concerns resulted in a decision to change, in 1992, from&#13;
injections to iodized oil in capsules (which provide protection for approximately 1 year, as compared&#13;
to 4 years for injected oil). Thus, to maintain the same amount of coverage as was provided by&#13;
injections it is necessary to administer 4 times as many capsules. In addition, based on the revised&#13;
estimates of the size of the population "at risk" it will be necessary to provide capsules to a much&#13;
larger population each year. Given the difficulties in administering a much smaller number of&#13;
injections it is unlikely that these much higher targets will be able to be met. As with injections, the&#13;
sustainability of a control program based on capsules is low as the cost-effectiveness continues to be&#13;
limited by low coverage and lack of information for targeting while recurrent costs remain high.&#13;
MOH records of injections and capsules distributed in recent years indicate that the maximum&#13;
proportion of the target population covered by injections is approximately 7 per cent and for&#13;
capsules less than 4 per cent. Clearly the effectiveness of these efforts has been low.&#13;
1.9    However, it is important that the unsatisfactory experience to date with capsules in Indonesia&#13;
does not preclude consideration of the most effective manner in which they might be used.&#13;
Internationally, the most cost-effective use of capsules (and injections before them) has been in&#13;
meeting highly specific objectives. For example, capsules have proved very cost-effective when&#13;
targeted to women of child bearing age in isolated situations where iodine deficiency was severe. By&#13;
the use of such specific targeting the capsules were being used solely to prevent cretinism (by&#13;
ensuring that women of childbearing age were iodine replete before conception) in areas where the&#13;
deficiency was severe (and the probability of a pregnancy resulting in a severely disabled child&#13;
raised proportionally) and in which other methods of control, such as iodized salt, had limited&#13;
application for logistic reasons. Under these circumstances capsules are highly effective in achieving&#13;
a specific outcome - elimination of cretinism. In contrast to this scenario, the use of both capsules&#13;
and injections in Indonesia has not, in practice, been targeted according to any of these criteria.&#13;
Consequently, their effectiveness has been very limited.&#13;
1.10   Iodized salt. Fortunately there is another method of delivering iodine to the community -&#13;
iodized salt. It was first tried in Indonesia in the 1920s, faltered after 1945 and was tried again&#13;
beginning in the mid-1970s. It still has much potential, particularly in light of the evidence from&#13;
other countries (Levin et al, 1993) of the much greater cost-effectiveness and coverage of this mode&#13;
of delivering iodine to the community and the recent evidence that the proportion of the Indonesian&#13;
population at risk of deficiency is much higher than previously thought (see Annex 1).&#13;
1.11   However, both the supply of, and demand for, iodized salt are limited and will need to be&#13;
improved if iodized salt is to be used as the vehicle for distributing iodine to the community. Recent&#13;
SUSENAS findings indicate that less than 60% of the salt consumed at the household level is&#13;
iodized to adequate levels and that one-fifth has no iodine at all. The levels of adequacy are lowest in&#13;
the major producing provinces (East, Central and West Java) and in the eastern part of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1.12   Almost half those surveyed in the 1995 SUSENAS did not "know about" iodized salt, with&#13;
the proportion much higher in rural than in urban areas. Approximately one-fifth of those who did&#13;
know about iodized salt did not consume it. These results are summarized in Table 1.2.&#13;

1.13   The difference in price between iodized and uniodized salt is a critical factor influencing the&#13;
demand for iodized salt. There are no systematic surveys of the price differences across the country.&#13;
However, information from the salt industry study conducted during project preparation (CTS, 1995;&#13;
CTS, 1996) indicates that in general iodized salt is 2-3 times the price of uniodized salt. The price&#13;
difference is driven by the availability of low quality raw salt, the high cost of processing a low&#13;
quality product, and the costs of iodization and packaging. Compared to the costs of processing and&#13;
packaging, those for iodization are small. In addition, as part of the effort to improve the supply of&#13;
iodized salt, one province has given monopoly rights for iodized salt to PT Garam. While the supply&#13;
of iodized salt has improved, the price is high due to lack of competition.&#13;
The salt industry&#13;
1.14   The salt industry itself is a cardinal factor limiting the supply of, and demand for, iodized&#13;
salt. By the end of the 1980s, the industry had a number of characteristics similar to those for other&#13;
highly regulated "essential" commodities in Indonesia, including fertilizer and cement. These&#13;
included (1) informal marketing arrangements; (2) protection from tariffs; (3) a range of non-tariff&#13;
steps and barriers restricting free entry and trade in the domestic market; (4)  technological&#13;
stagnation in a technically inefficient industry; and (5) inability to enforce government regulations&#13;
relating to iodization. (However, unlike fertilizer and cement, the government depends on salt as a&#13;
component of an important public health program). There was also a floor price for "People's salt"&#13;
(salt produced by small sharefarmers) operated by PT Garam, the government-owned salt producer&#13;
and processor, which was the dominant player in the industry. The result of this floor price was a&#13;
rapid increase in the area of land devoted to People's salt; overproduction of low quality salt; and&#13;
large national stocks of salt held in conjunction with the price support scheme. The overall result&#13;
was a low quality, high cost product and very inadequate levels of iodization and consumption of&#13;
iodized salt, partly as a result of the wide difference in price between raw salt and the processed,&#13;
iodized and packaged product.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
C.    INCREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IODIZED SALT&#13;
1.15   Increasing supply. The main obstacles to improving the supply and consumption of iodized&#13;
salt are the low quality of the salt produced, and inadequate monitoring of iodine content of salt and&#13;
enforcement of regulations. These issues are discussed in detail in Annex 2.&#13;
a. Low quality of salt. The quality of salt produced in Indonesia is low, a reflection of the&#13;
low level of technology used by salt farmer/sharefarmers and PT Garam. Improving the&#13;
quality of salt produced is an important aspect of sustainable improvement in iodization and&#13;
requires changing the production techniques used by salt farmers/sharefarmers. Within the&#13;
industry there is little expertise on improved methods of salt production.&#13;
b. Monitoring the iodine content of salt is inadequate and regulations mandating iodization&#13;
of salt for human consumption are seldom enforced. Although responsibility for monitoring&#13;
and enforcement rests with both the MOIT and the MOH, the ability to enforce regulations&#13;
via cancellation of licenses lies with the MOIT. Resources for monitoring in both ministries&#13;
have been inadequate and this has hindered identification of those processors who&#13;
persistently fail to produce adequately iodized salt. As part of this effort, it is vital that the&#13;
government's own salt company, PT Garam, ensures that its own salt production is iodized.&#13;
1.16   Increasing demand for iodized salt. There is considerable potential to increase awareness&#13;
of the effects of iodine deficiency and the role of iodized salt in their control. The need now is for a&#13;
general campaign combined with targeted additional efforts to increase consumption in those areas&#13;
in which iodine deficiency is severe. This needs to be coordinated with efforts to increase the&#13;
availability and affordability of iodized salt.&#13;
1.17   Effect of recent developments in the salt industry. In addition, a number of recent&#13;
developments in the industry have implications for reliance on salt as the primary vehicle for&#13;
delivery of iodine to the community.&#13;
1.18   Elimination of the floor price for salt and the national stock of salt has resulted in a sharp&#13;
drop in the farmgate price of salt from approximately 30 Rp/kg in 1993 to 15 Rp/kg in 1995. It is&#13;
likely that prices will continue at this much lower level, because the earlier floor price was too high&#13;
and the new entrants attracted by it resulted in excess capacity; and PT Garam is still seeking to sell&#13;
the remainder of the national stock.&#13;
1.19 Falling returns to salt production will force change in the industry and provide an important&#13;
opportunity for assisting salt farmers/sharefarmers to improve their circumstances through a range of&#13;
strategies. For those able to survive in a more competitive environment these include technological&#13;
innovation, improved management of individual farms, consolidation where feasible and, for some,&#13;
complementary production of other commodities (see Annex 2). Other farmers/sharefarmers are&#13;
more likely to survive by moving out of salt altogether and concentrating on alternate commodities&#13;
of which fish and artemia are the best prospects. The overall effect will be increased quality and a&#13;
reduction in the chronic surplus of salt.&#13;
1.20 The most recent attempt by the government to improve iodization of salt is a new set of&#13;
regulations introduced under the Presidential Decree (Kepres) 69/1994. The decree sets out new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
requirements for the industry with particular emphasis on processing. Many of the smaller&#13;
processors will not be able to meet the new requirements and will not be licensed. Preliminary&#13;
indications are that the number of processors will be reduced from approximately 300 in 1995 to&#13;
around 70 in 1997 with the smaller operators dropping out. It is likely that the number will fall even&#13;
further in the first 2-3 years of the regulations as other smaller firms persistently fail to meet the&#13;
standards for iodized salt. The final number may be as low as 50. As a result, monitoring the iodine&#13;
content of salt will be easier.&#13;
1.21   PT Garam, the government-owned company, is responsible for 25 percent of domestic&#13;
production. As a result of its dominance as a producer and advantage in several provinces as a result&#13;
of restrictive licenses, it holds a privileged position in the industry. And there are now plans for it to&#13;
purchase and wash 300,000 tons of people's salt per annum as a joint venture with a commercial&#13;
partner. This has been financed, at least in part, by a soft loan from the government, partly in support&#13;
of efforts to improve the iodization of salt. The overall effect of this move on the salt industry is&#13;
unclear. Despite the privileged position it now occupies, the company iodizes only 10 percent of the&#13;
salt it produces for human consumption. It is critical that, by June 30, 1998, PT Garam iodizes all&#13;
the salt it produces and/or processes for human consumption (assurances to this effect were received&#13;
during negotiations).&#13;
1.22   The dominance of PT Garam and its inefficiency (see Annex 1) mean that it is a price leader&#13;
in many parts of the country, in effect allowing salt prices to remain higher than they would in a&#13;
more competitive setting. It is important PT Garam operates on a commercial basis, forcing it to&#13;
compete with other producers and become more efficient.&#13;
1.23   Government moves to deregulate the economy are also effecting salt. As part of the recent&#13;
deregulation package announced in June 1996, tariff on salt for human consumption decreased from&#13;
25 percent to 20 percent and are scheduled to fall to 10 percent by 2003.&#13;
1.24   New players are entering the market. One international salt firm has established a joint&#13;
venture with an Indonesian partner and other firms are considering entering the market.&#13;
1.25   The overall effect of these changes is unclear. Some, such as the reduction in the number of&#13;
processors and the increased dominance of PT Garam, will decrease competitive pressures. Others,&#13;
particularly tariff decreases, the entrance of new players, and enforcement of the regulations on&#13;
iodization of salt, will increase competition. It is critical that overall policy is set to increase&#13;
competition and ensure that the playing field is level. In this respect, a more rapid reduction in&#13;
tariffs, and elimination of remaining non-tariff barriers in several provinces would all quicken the&#13;
move to a competitive industry. At the same time it is vital that the government resists any pressures&#13;
to reintroduce a floor price and national stock of salt.&#13;
1.26   In summary, the Indonesian experience in controlling iodine deficiency confirms the&#13;
limitations of injections and capsules - both are expensive, their coverage has consistently been very&#13;
low and their overall effect on iodine deficiency very limited. An important factor contributing to&#13;
this limited impact is the lack of information which would allow efforts to be directed to those areas&#13;
which are most deficient in iodine and their effects to be evaluated. At the same time, even though it&#13;
could be the most cost-effective and sustainable method of delivering iodine to the community, salt&#13;
has not fulfilled its potential. Less than 60% of the salt consumed at the household level is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
adequately iodized. Monitoring of the iodine content in salt is inadequate and enforcement of&#13;
regulations minimal. Nevertheless, recent changes in the industry provide an opportunity for&#13;
improving iodization on a sustained basis if complementary activities (e.g., improved salt quality&#13;
and increased demand) are provided and coordinated to achieve maximum effect and the overall&#13;
policy settings promote the development of a competitive industry.&#13;
D.    ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS TO IMPROVING IODINE STATUS&#13;
1.27   There are two other important factors currently limiting the effectiveness of iodine control&#13;
efforts - the lack of information on the iodine status of the community and inadequate coordination&#13;
of efforts between ministries.&#13;
1.28   Assessing the iodine status of the community. An important factor contributing to this&#13;
limited impact is the lack of information which would allow efforts to be directed to those areas&#13;
which are most deficient in iodine and their effects to be evaluated. Current information is&#13;
misleading and out of date. What is needed now is a series of surveys covering all provinces which&#13;
provide information on the basis of which kabupaten with low iodine status can be identified. More&#13;
intensive surveys would then be carried out in kabupaten with low iodine status. This information at&#13;
both the kabupaten and kecamatan levels could then be used to target interventions more effectively&#13;
(e.g., intensive monitoring of iodine levels in salt, distribution of capsules).&#13;
1.29 Government coordination. To date, the government policy and coordination role in control&#13;
of IDD has not been well executed. This is due, in large part, to the intersectoral nature of the efforts&#13;
required, the lack of clear responsibility and accountability within government for control of iodine&#13;
deficiency and overall policy formulation, the absence of a mechanism for coordination of efforts&#13;
between the various ministries involved and the private sector and the lack of adequate information&#13;
on the iodine status of the population. If the renewed efforts to control IDD are to succeed there is an&#13;
urgent need for substantive coordination of the activities of all groups involved.&#13;
E.    A NEW STRATEGY&#13;
1.30   Thus, in addition to confirming the limitations of capsules and the potential of salt,&#13;
Indonesian experience also points to the need for complementary inputs provided they are&#13;
effectively coordinated. International experience confirms the need for a clear shift in the strategy&#13;
for control of iodine deficiency from one in which the _ fa=&#142; primary emphasis has been on&#13;
distribution of capsules with secondary irnportance assigned to iodization of salt to one in which the&#13;
greatest emphasis is given to salt and capsules used for highly targeted distribution in very specific&#13;
circumstances. A strategy in which there is increased reliance on iodized salt and targeted use of&#13;
capsules has five main elements - first, assess and monitor the iodine status of the community in&#13;
order to provide a basis for targeting efforts to those areas in which the iodine status is low; second,&#13;
rely on iodized salt as the main means of delivering iodine - this will depend on improved quality of&#13;
salt production, monitoring the iodine content of salt and enforcing regulations; third, increase&#13;
demand for iodized salt in areas of low iodine status; fourth, restrict use of capsules to women of&#13;
child bearing age in areas where iodine deficiency is severe; and fifth, coordinated activities between&#13;
ministries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
1.31   But the effectiveness and sustainability of these changes will be low unless they are carried&#13;
out in the context of a policy framework which promotes an increasingly competitive salt industry.&#13;
This will involve continued reduction in tariffs, ensuring that PT Garam operates on a fully&#13;
commercial basis. Assurances on removal of non-tariff restraints to trade in iodized salt and salt for&#13;
human consumption by December 31, 1998 were received during negotiations. Assurances were also&#13;
obtained that until completion of the Project, no floor price for salt and iodized salt is established by&#13;
GOI, and no buffer stock of salt is established by GOI.&#13;
1.32   The overall effect of such a revised strategy would be a rapid improvement in the iodine&#13;
status of the community as a result of increased consumption of adequately iodized salt and the&#13;
specific targeting of a limited number of capsules to areas of greatest need. A comparison of this&#13;
revised approach with "business as usual" and the outcomes they could be expected to produce, is&#13;
summarized in Table 1.3.&#13;

2. PAST AND PROSPECTIVE BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
A.    LESSONS LEARNED FROM WORLD BANK PROJECTS AND OTHER INITIATIVES&#13;
2.1   IDD Project and Components. Whilst IDD control activities are included in many Bank&#13;
projects, to date most of these activities have concentrated on surveys of iodine status and&#13;
procurement of iodized oil. Few, if any, have directly tackled the problem of iodized salt including&#13;
salt quality, supply and demand for iodized salt, monitoring of the iodine content of salt and&#13;
enforcement of regulations.&#13;
2.2    One partial exception is the "Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Project" for the People's&#13;
Republic of China which became effective in April 1996. The central strategy of the project is&#13;
iodization of all salt for human and animal consumption. Implementation of the project requires&#13;
coordination of several ministries (including industry and health) at three levels of government. The&#13;
government has established a high level group to coordinate the program in which implementation of&#13;
the industrial activities is under the control of the Council for Light Industry. Health-related aspects&#13;
of the program will be carried out by the Ministry of Health. Additional technical assistance will be&#13;
provided by other donors. As the project has only recently commenced it is still too early to draw&#13;
lessons for other projects.&#13;
2.3    Health and Nutrition projects in Indonesia. The Bank has experience in IDD control in&#13;
Indonesia through small components in the Second Nutrition and Community Health Project&#13;
(NCH2) and, in particular, through the ongoing Third Community Health and Nutrition Project&#13;
(CHN3) where IDD control activities are being carried out at both the central and provincial levels.&#13;
These activities include IDD surveys, social marketing of iodized salt and provincial level&#13;
monitoring of the iodine levels in salt. Experience in these projects indicates (a) the need for a&#13;
national strategy for IDD control which allows for differentiation of approaches according to the&#13;
local situation. Although IDD occurs in all provinces there is considerable variation between and&#13;
within provinces pointing to the need for geographic differentiation of strategies. In addition, the salt&#13;
industry is complex, has many participants, and there is considerable inter-island trade in salt. Whilst&#13;
East Java is responsible for at least half the total salt produced, seven other provinces also produce&#13;
salt for human consumption. Consequently, a national perspective of the IDD problem is needed&#13;
which allows integration of demand, supply and government regulation issues; (b) such a national&#13;
approach will also need to be inter-ministerial in that the statutory responsibilities for assessing IDD&#13;
status, and implementation of the various strategies which might be used in control of IDD, is spread&#13;
across the Ministries of Health, Industry and Trade, and Interior; (c) the inter-ministerial nature of&#13;
the activities points to the need for a mechanism to coordinate the overall effort; (d) the need to&#13;
recognize the role of the private sector in the salt industry and the important part it has to play in&#13;
improved efficiency of salt production and processing; (e) there is an urgent need for information in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
all provinces on both the IDD status of the population and the iodine content of salt at the household&#13;
level; (f) it is important to build on the experience of, and collaborate with UNICEF in IDD control&#13;
activities.&#13;
2.4   In addition, the results of surveys of the iodine status of the community in provinces included&#13;
in CHN3 are now becoming available. The results of the survey in Maluku have been analyzed.&#13;
Results for the other four provinces will be available in the latter part of 1996 and will provide a&#13;
valuable basis for targeting activities in those provinces in the early years of the project while new&#13;
surveys are carried out in other provinces as a prelude to extension of the targeting approach.&#13;
2.5   Thus, it is now clear that whilst the current response through CHN3 has been important, and&#13;
will provide a solid basis for the initial activities proposed under the IDD project, an expanded and&#13;
intensified effort is needed if the extent of iodine deficiency is to be reduced. The project proposed&#13;
here will do that.&#13;
2.6    UNICEF has long experience in control of IDD in Indonesia. It has provided support to the&#13;
GOI for control of IDD for 20 years, originally by donating iodization equipment and iodate, then&#13;
iodized oil. In recent years UNICEF has worked primarily with MOIT to improve iodization of salt,&#13;
primarily through improved salt monitoring, marketing campaigns, and community-based efforts&#13;
using school teachers. The Bank has participated with UNICEF in a discussions with government on&#13;
IDD since 1990. The monitoring and information, education and communication (IEC) elements of&#13;
the project proposed here draw on the experience and pilot projects of UNICEF.&#13;
B.    LINKAGE TO COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR BANK&#13;
INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.7   The project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia,&#13;
which was presented to the Board on March 21, 1995, and the CAS Progress Report discussed by the&#13;
Board on June 4, 1996. The CAS endorses government's role in establishing a regulatory framework&#13;
and in supporting decentralization and participation. The design of the proposed project is consistent&#13;
with the emphasis in the CAS on the importance of human resource development to promote&#13;
economic growth, competitiveness, and structural transformation, and on a more selective, efficient&#13;
use of public resources. In particular, the CAS notes that considerable scope exists to improve the&#13;
quality of health services through better resource use.&#13;
2.8   In the last six years the Bank has engaged in a comprehensive dialogue with MOH and&#13;
Bappenas on the problems of controlling IDD. This dialogue, which recently has been extended to&#13;
include MOIT and MOHA, has drawn the attention of the government to the need for a&#13;
comprehensive policy with emphasis on sustainable solutions, the importance of current and reliable&#13;
information on the IDD status of the population in all provinces, the short term nature of intervention&#13;
strategies based on iodized oil, and the important potential role of iodized salt. In addition, recent&#13;
sector work by the Bank has highlighted the problems with GOI's current efforts and concluded that&#13;
the IDD problem is considerably larger than was previously thought.&#13;
2.9   The Bank's comparative advantage in supporting the control of IDD derives not only from&#13;
the ongoing dialogue and its experience in control of IDD through CHN3. As a result of the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
analysis of both economic and technical issues, it has credibility with the Ministry of Finance (MOF)&#13;
and Bappenas as well as the line ministries involved and is therefore in a position to mediate and&#13;
facilitate communication across ministries. Other donors, particularly UNICEF, have promoted&#13;
control of iodine deficiency, especially through social marketing and the MOIT. Apart from its&#13;
primary focus on a single ministry, UNICEF has been unable to provide the level of resources&#13;
needed for an Intensified IDD Control Project. In this regard, the Bank is clearly assuming its role as&#13;
the lender of last resort.&#13;
2.10   Consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy, this project will lead to improved quality&#13;
and efficiency in the health services. Improved iodization of salt will allow the health sector to&#13;
increase the proportion of the population covered by control activities and eliminate the use of&#13;
expensive iodine capsules except in those areas where the prevalence of IDD is very high and/or the&#13;
distribution of salt limited. It will also provide substantial benefits to the poor who are more likely to&#13;
consume uniodized salt and, therefore, to suffer from iodine deficiency. This project fits well with&#13;
other ongoing and proposed Bank projects in health, primary education and early child development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    PROJECT GOAL AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1    The objective of the project is to lower the prevalence of iodine deficiency. This will be&#13;
achieved through the following components:&#13;
(a)    monitoring the iodine status of the community,&#13;
(b)    increasing consumption of iodized salt;&#13;
(c)    increasing the supply of iodized salt;&#13;
(d)    targeted distribution of capsules; and&#13;
(e)    improved coordination of activities between ministries and with the private sector&#13;
B.    PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;

C.    PROJECT DESIGN&#13;
3.3   The project would have 5 main components, each corresponding to one of the main&#13;
objectives.&#13;
3.4    Component 1. Monitoring iodine status of the community (Total base costs $6.3 million -&#13;
see Table 4.1 and Annex 7 for details) to include:&#13;
* IDD surveys and mapping&#13;
* ongoing monitoring and surveillance of iodine status in the community&#13;
* operational research&#13;
3.5   IDD surveys and mapping of the iodine status of the community. This component has&#13;
two main aims - to provide an assessment of the extent of the problem and to serve as a basis for&#13;
targeting capsules. These mapping, monitoring and surveillance aims will be met using the following&#13;
survey methods.&#13;
(a)   Kecamatan IDD Prevalence surveys. The project will support kecamatan IDD&#13;
prevalence surveys which will be coordinated from the national level. Data from&#13;
these surveys will allow mapping of iodine status of the community at the kecamatan&#13;
level and provide a baseline against which to measure change over time. School&#13;
children in grades 3-4 will be the indicator group and goiter by palpation the specific&#13;
indicator. Similar surveys have already been conducted in six provinces (West Java,&#13;
Central Java, Yogyakarta, NTB, Maluku, Irian Jaya) under the CHN3 project.&#13;
Comparable surveys will be conducted in the remaining 20 provinces in the course of&#13;
the project.&#13;
(b)   National IDD survey. Funds will be provided through the project to repeat the survey&#13;
of iodine status of schoolchildren in all kabupaten at the end of the project to allow&#13;
impact to be assessed. In addition, levels of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)&#13;
will be measured in a sample of women of child bearing age to provide provincial&#13;
estimates of the prevalence of abnormal values.&#13;
3.6   Salt consumption survey. Following the successful initiative funded by UNICEF in 1995,&#13;
the project will support annual monitoring of the adequacy of iodine levels in salt at the household&#13;
level in conjunction with SUSENAS.&#13;
3.7    Operations research. The project will fund operations research to address questions on the&#13;
determinants of iodine status that arise in the course of implementation.&#13;
3.8   Component 2. Increased consumption of iodized salt (Total base costs $3.2 million see&#13;
Table 4.1 and Annex 7 for details).&#13;
* mass media campaign to increase consumption of iodized salt&#13;
* in-depth campaigns in areas which do not respond to media campaign&#13;
* promotion of iodized capsules in targeted kecamatan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
3.9    Mass media campaign. The project will fund advertising through mass media. An intensive&#13;
radio campaign, complemented by television, will be undertaken with the express objective of&#13;
effecting significant change in the percentage of households consuming iodized salt. The success of&#13;
these campaigns will be tracked every year through SUSENAS data and MOIT surveys in those&#13;
areas where more intensive monitoring is occurring.&#13;
3.10   Promoting capsules. Although the primary vehicle for distributing iodine is salt, in areas&#13;
which are either isolated or where the level of deficiency is particularly severe, annual capsule&#13;
distribution may be the only way to improve iodine status in the short- to medium-term. The project&#13;
will support intensive pre-distribution promotion and publicity to alert populations to upcoming&#13;
distribution days.&#13;
3.11   The demand generation activities will be managed by the Center for Health Education&#13;
(PKM). However, because much of this activity is similar to a commercial marketing and advertising&#13;
campaign PKM will subcontract a highly qualified and experienced advertising agency to handle its&#13;
radio and television spot campaigns and to carry out the formative research required. PKM will,&#13;
nevertheless, play an important role in orienting both the research and the marketing design. The&#13;
activities will be coordinated with those of other ministries through the Project Management Team&#13;
and Bappenas.&#13;
3.12   Component 3. Increased supply of iodized salt (Total base costs $8.9 million - see Table&#13;
4.1 and Annex 7 for details). This component will involve the following activities:&#13;
* monitoring of the iodine content of salt&#13;
* enforcement of salt iodization&#13;
* promoting a rules-based approach to the industry&#13;
* improving the quality of salt produced by farmers/sharefarmers&#13;
* Salt farmers/sharefarmers development program&#13;
* operations research&#13;
3.13   Monitoring the iodine content of salt. The iodine content of salt will be monitored at&#13;
several points in the salt distribution system with a focus on actions and responses. To minimize data&#13;
gathering the most intensive and frequent monitoring will occur in those areas where the iodine&#13;
status of the community is low and/or where the iodine content of salt is inadequate. The elements of&#13;
the system are as follows -&#13;
(a)    Routine monitoring at production level. The project will fund external monitoring to&#13;
be carried out by the MOIT who will visit each plant monthly at random to test all&#13;
brands of salt using principles of lot quality assurance (LQAS) to determine if each&#13;
brand is adequately iodized. External monitoring will only be carried out in the 70&#13;
kabupaten in which are located firms that process more than 500 tons/year. Technical&#13;
advice to producers and processors to improve the quality of their product will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
available through the Association of Iodized Salt Producers (APROGAKOB) in&#13;
conjunction with the MOIT.&#13;
(b)    Routine monitoring at market level. The project will fund routine monitoring at the&#13;
market level where salt will be sampled by brand in all kabupaten. Intensive market&#13;
monitoring, to be carried out by MOIT, will be carried out in those kabupaten in&#13;
which the adequacy of iodine levels in salt at the household level is low. In&#13;
kabupaten where the adequacy of iodine levels in salt at the household level is high,&#13;
verification monitoring will be carried out by MOH-Directorate of Food and Drug&#13;
Control. Assessment of the adequacy of iodine levels in salt at the household level&#13;
will be based on the results of annual monitoring of iodine levels in salt through&#13;
SUSENAS - see para 3.6.&#13;
(c)    Community-based monitoring. The project will fund qualitative monitoring of iodine&#13;
levels in salt. This will extend the existing collaboration between UNICEF, the&#13;
School Teachers Association and the MOIT. Children will bring samples of salt from&#13;
home to be tested by the teacher. Communities in which the proportion of salt&#13;
adequately iodized is low will be identified. Constraints at the household level will&#13;
be investigated by Posyandu workers and corrective action taken. Results will be&#13;
transmitted to the MOH and the MOIT through the puskesmas.&#13;
(d)    Database of salt processors. The project will fund the upgrading and maintenance by&#13;
the MOIT of a complete listing of all salt processors. It will include a company and&#13;
brand profile and will be available to all ministries participating in the project.&#13;
(e)    Data management and analysis. The project will fund entry of data from each of the&#13;
monitoring activities through the provincial MOIT offices. The information will be&#13;
transmitted to, and stored in, the MOIT central database on salt production and&#13;
processing. The database will be accessible to all ministries contributing to it. The&#13;
project will also provide resources to enable MOIT to produce standard monthly&#13;
reports on salt production and iodization for each of the ministries involved.&#13;
3.14   Enforcement of salt iodization. Control of IDD by iodization of salt will only succeed if an&#13;
effective enforcement mechanism is in place. This will be achieved by:&#13;
(a)    encouraging self-enforcement by the industry. The project will provide funds for&#13;
self-enforcement by the industry. The funds will be used to allow the industry,&#13;
through APROGAKOB, to assist its members to comply, primarily through provision&#13;
of technical assistance.&#13;
(b)    MOIT will enforce the regulations on the iodization of salt. The project will provide&#13;
funds for MOIT to evaluate monthly reports on the adequacy of iodine levels in salt&#13;
at the processing level and follow-up activities. The license of factories receiving 2&#13;
warning letters within 6 months will be canceled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
3.15   Strengthening a rules-based approach. The project will provide funds during the first two&#13;
years of the project for Government to evaluate the current regulations for salt and iodized salt with&#13;
the aim of placing emphasis on the product rather than the process. This will involve setting&#13;
minimum standards for salt and iodized salt which are appropriate to the industry in Indonesia and&#13;
consistent with production of adequately iodized salt. During negotiations assurances were received&#13;
from Government that a review of existing regulations relating to salt and iodized salt will be&#13;
carried out by June 30, 1998, and, thereafter, regulations will be updated as necessary to specify&#13;
minimum standards for salt and iodized salt.&#13;
3.16  Improved quality of salt produced. The project will fund extension activities in the major&#13;
salt producing areas by APROGAKOB and MOIT to assist saltfarmers/sharefarmers with adoption&#13;
of new techniques and pond design to improve the quality of salt produced.&#13;
3.17   Salt farmers/sharefarmers development program. The project will fund activities aimed&#13;
at two groups of farmers. First, those who are likely to survive as salt producers in a more&#13;
competitive environment if new technology and management techniques are adopted. Here, the&#13;
project will fund demonstration trials of improved methods of salt production and integration&#13;
between salt farming, fisheries and artemia production. Second, those farms which by virtue of&#13;
location, or other reasons, are unlikely to be competitive salt producers. For this group the project&#13;
will fund demonstration plots of alternative commodities to be produced including fish and artemia.&#13;
In addition the project will fund improved weather stations in the major salt fields.&#13;
3.18   Operations research. The project will fund operational research to address constraints to&#13;
production and processing not dealt with so far in Indonesia. Examples include the most effective&#13;
production techniques for small farmers/sharefarmers to produce higher quality salt from limited&#13;
pond areas, and factors effecting the rate of decline in iodine levels of salt under various storage&#13;
conditions. Addressing operational issues such as these will require resources for an active and&#13;
ongoing operations research effort. The results will be used in determining the annual plans for the&#13;
project.&#13;
3.19 This component will be managed by the MOIT as part of the overall project. The activities&#13;
will be coordinated with those of other ministries through the Project Management Team and&#13;
Bappenas.&#13;
3.20   Component 4. Targeted Distribution of Iodine Capsules. (Total base costs $9.7 million -&#13;
see Table 4.1 and Annex 7 for details). The project will fund purchase of iodized oil capsules for&#13;
distribution in kecamatan where deficiency is particularly severe and the availability of iodized salt&#13;
is limited. In these areas, capsules will be delivered annually to women of child bearing age through&#13;
the health system following intensive pre-distribution publicity to increase compliance (see para&#13;
3.9). During negotiations Government gave assurances that until completion of the Project,&#13;
procurement of iodized oil capsules would only be undertaken as requiredfor the carrying out of the&#13;
Project and that Government will, starting December 31, 1997, carry out annual reviews of the&#13;
results of the surveys to assess the iodine status of the community and the monitoring of iodine levels&#13;
in salt to determine whether use of capsules can be reduced in subsequent years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
3.21   This component of the project will be managed by the Directorate of Nutrition of the&#13;
Ministry of Health. The activities will be coordinated with those of other ministries through the&#13;
Project Management Team and Bappenas.&#13;
3.22   Component 5. Inter-Ministerial Policy and Program  Coordination for Control of&#13;
Iodine Deficiency (Total base costs $5.8 million - see Table 4.1 and Annex 7 for details) to&#13;
include:&#13;
*  inter-ministerial coordination of project activities and policy and identification of&#13;
clear lines of accountability and responsibility&#13;
*  ensuring periodic independent "third party" checks of all data and assessment of&#13;
the iodine situation in the nation.&#13;
3.23   Inter-ministerial coordination. The project will fund activities to improve inter-ministerial&#13;
coordination. At the central level, control of IDD requires action in at least 4 ministries.&#13;
Coordination, together with clear lines of responsibility and accountability are vital. This&#13;
coordination function will be carried out through the National Coordination Committee chaired by&#13;
Bappenas. At the provincial level, although implementation of programs under this strategy will&#13;
remain the responsibility of the individual ministries and the private sector, coordination will be&#13;
carried out by the Ministry of Home Affairs. During negotiations the Government provided&#13;
assurances that it will establish, by January 31, 1997, a National Iodine Deficiency Disorder&#13;
Coordination Committee, to be chaired by Bappenas, with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.24   Independent "third party" reviews. Support will be provided through the project for&#13;
periodic reviews of all results related to the iodine status of the community, iodine levels in salt and&#13;
epidemiological information to determine whether the results are consistent and, if not, the reason&#13;
why and the implications for the project activities. These reviews will be the responsibility of&#13;
Bappenas. During negotiations Government agreed to carry out periodic independent third party&#13;
reviews starting October 31, 1998, of the iodine status of the population and the effectiveness of the&#13;
control program.&#13;
3.25   Project Management (Total base costs $3.4 million). The project will fund project&#13;
management activities, much of which will be concerned with coordination of activities at the&#13;
national and provincial levels. This would be done through National and Provincial Coordinating&#13;
Committees to be chaired by Bappenas and Bappeda, respectively. Members of the National&#13;
Committee will be drawn from MOIT, MOH and MOHA. Of the donors, both UNICEF and the&#13;
Bank have significant and ongoing involvement in assisting government to control IDD. Their&#13;
membership on this committee is important to ensure that donor activities are also coordinated as&#13;
part of the overall IDD control effort. The committee would meet at least each 6 months. Its&#13;
responsibilities would include:&#13;
(a)   to review annual plans of participating ministries for IDD related activities&#13;
(b)    ensure that activities are coordinated at the national and provincial levels&#13;
(c)    carry out six-monthly review of activities and recommendations to overcome&#13;
problems identified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
3.26   Membership of the Provincial Committees will include provincial level representatives from.&#13;
MOIT, MOH and MOHA. The responsibilities of these provincial committees will be to review,&#13;
evaluate and coordinate provincial level activities.&#13;
3.27   An IDD Project Management Unit will be established in the MOH. At the center the project&#13;
will be headed by the Director General (DG) of Community Health. The Project Director will be&#13;
advised by a Steering Committee chaired by the DG of Community Health with members drawn&#13;
from MOH, MOIT, MOHA, Bappenas, MOF. During negotiations the Government provided&#13;
assurances that it will establish, by January 31, 1997, and thereafter maintain within MOH an IDD&#13;
Project Management Unit, of agreed size and skill mix, under terms of reference acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
3.28   Channeling of funds. Loan funds would be channeled through development budget (DIP)&#13;
allocations at the central, provincial and district levels.&#13;
3.29   The size and content of the components were justified by the appraisal mission as follows:&#13;
Component 1. Monitoring iodine status of the community.&#13;
These surveys will be carried out in those provinces in which surveys have not already been&#13;
funded through the Third Community Health and Nutrition Project. The design of these&#13;
surveys provides a firm basis for targeting of efforts while minimizing overall costs.&#13;
Component 2. Increased consumption of iodized salt.&#13;
The activities in the mass medi and in-depth campaigns, as well as the promotion of&#13;
capsules are based on extensive discussions with Jakarta-based professionals dealing with&#13;
similar campaigns in an advertising agency, a market research firm and UNICEF. The&#13;
activities will be more intense in those areas in which iodine deficiency is more severe and in&#13;
which there is inadequate improvement in demand for iodized salt.&#13;
Component 3. Increased supply of iodized salt.&#13;
The monitoring and enforcement activities are based on a UNICEF consultant&#13;
recommendations as modified by the Bank team after extensive discussions with GOI staff.&#13;
The modifications focused the activities more sharply on those areas in which the iodine&#13;
levels in salt are inadequate. They will be carried out at a minimum level of intensity in all&#13;
kabupaten and at greater frequency in those kabupaten with iodine deficiency. Activities to&#13;
assist saltfarrners and improve the quality of salt are based on the study of salt&#13;
farmers/sharefarmers carried out as part of project preparation. The budget is based on the&#13;
cost estimates of similar activities in other ministries.&#13;
Component 4. Targeted delivery of iodine capsules.&#13;
The volume of capsules to be purchased and distributed is based on the current levels of use&#13;
by the government in the first year of the project and decreases in outer years as the&#13;
adequacy of iodization of salt increases.&#13;
Component 5. Inter-Ministerial Policy and Program Coordination&#13;
Coordination between ministries and various levels of government is crucial to maximizing&#13;
the effect of this project. At the central level this requires modest funding for Bappenas. At&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
the provincial level this will be done through the MOHA. As all provinces are expected to&#13;
have some areas in which iodine deficiency is severe this activity will occur in all provinces.&#13;
Allowance has been made for more activities in the larger provinces in which iodine&#13;
deficiency is known to be a problem, particularly on Java.&#13;
3.30   Project Implementation. The project will be implemented at both the national and&#13;
provincial levels as described below (and in the Project Implementation Plan in Annex 10).&#13;
3.31   National level. Project activities will include formulation of policy for IDD control, revision&#13;
of regulations governing the salt industry, improved enforcement of iodization of salt, intersectoral&#13;
coordination, monitoring of the iodine status of the population and iodine content of salt, and&#13;
national level activities related to stimulation of demand for iodized salt.&#13;
3.32   Implementation of these national level activities will begin as soon as possible. The highest&#13;
priority will be given to immediately strengthening those activities which will bring about an&#13;
increase in the proportion of salt which is adequately iodized. This includes monitoring iodine levels&#13;
of salt at the factory level, provision of technical assistance to those factories found to have&#13;
inadequate iodization, creation of a combined database incorporating the results of the monitoring,&#13;
and termination of the license of those processors who persistently produce inadequately iodized&#13;
salt. In Year I these activities will concentrate on Java, the site of 85 percent of the total salt&#13;
production and iodization capacity. In the second year the emphasis will shift to the remaining sites&#13;
of salt production and processing whilst maintaining close surveillance of the situation in Java.&#13;
3.33   Provincial level. At the provincial level the main strategy is to target activities. There is&#13;
considerable variation in iodine status between kabupaten and/or kecamatan. Consequently, the most&#13;
efficient approach, particularly for the expensive iodine capsules and more intensive IEC and&#13;
monitoring is to focus activity in those kecamatan in which iodine deficiency is most severe and the&#13;
degree of iodization of salt most inadequate. Two different packages of services will be targeted to&#13;
particular kecamatan depending on the severity of iodine deficiency and the adequacy of salt&#13;
iodization. The introduction of these packages will be phased in various parts of the country. The&#13;
method of targeting, the content of the packages and the manner of phasing are described below.&#13;
(a)    Targeting. Typically, the severity of iodine deficiency varies with location. In this&#13;
project the unit for targeting is the kecamatan which will be classified, on the basis of&#13;
the Kabupaten IDD Prevalence surveys (see para 3.5) into those with adequate iodine&#13;
status and those with low iodine status. Those with adequate iodine status will&#13;
receive a general intervention containing a minimum set of activities (Package A, see&#13;
Table 3.2) described below.  Kecamatan with low  iodine status will receive&#13;
additional inputs, including capsules (Package B). As the iodine content of salt and&#13;
the iodine status of the community improve the intervention delivered will change to&#13;
Package A.&#13;
(b)    Packages. The range of "services" from which the various packages are formed&#13;
include salt, capsules, routine monitoring, intensive monitoring, general IEC and IEC&#13;
specific to the promotion of capsules. The combinations used in each package are&#13;
shown below in Table 3.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

include - )      Capsules IEC                     Yes&#13;
(c)    Phasing. The provincial level activities will be phased according to the availability of&#13;
data, the adequacy of iodine levels in salt and general feasibility considerations. This&#13;
information on the adequacy of iodine levels in salt is now available by kabupaten&#13;
from SUSENAS. They indicate that, in general, the levels are most inadequate on&#13;
Java, then in the eastern provinces and most adequate in Kalimantan and Sumatra.&#13;
This overall phasing has been adopted for the introduction of provincial activities.&#13;
Thus, the initial emphasis for provincial activities will be on Java where older&#13;
surveys have indicated iodine deficiency is a problem and recent SUSENAS&#13;
information indicates that levels of adequacy of salt are also lowest. In addition,&#13;
information on the iodine status of the population is now, or soon will be, available at&#13;
the kabupaten level for West and Central Java and Yogyakarta from surveys being&#13;
carried out under CHN3. The current project will fund a similar survey in East Java&#13;
early in the first year. In the meantime provincial level activities (as described under&#13;
"Targeting" and "Packages" above) will commence in the rest of Java.&#13;
3.34   In the eastern provinces (NTT, NTB, TT, Maluku, Irian Jaya, and all Sulawesi provinces)&#13;
information on the adequacy of iodine levels in salt are available from SUSENAS. In addition,&#13;
information on the iodine status of the population will be available in 1997 through CHN3 surveys&#13;
for NTT, Irian Jaya and Maluku. Consequently, in Year I efforts will concentrate on obtaining&#13;
information on the iodine status of the community in the remaining provinces.&#13;
3.35   Technical assistance. The project would support modest amounts of international and local&#13;
technical assistance, concentrated in the first three years (Annex 4). International technical&#13;
assistance, estimated at 9 person years, would be directed at improving the quality of salt produced&#13;
by salt farmners/sharefarmers and at the quality of iodization, demand generation and operational&#13;
research. Local technical assistance of 30 person years would be used to assist with training&#13;
modules, demand generation and operational research.&#13;
3.36   Performance evaluation and supervision strategy. Monitoring of project implementation&#13;
will be the responsibility of the Project Secretariat in conjunction with the National and Provincial&#13;
Coordination Committees. The implementation progress of the project will be assessed through&#13;
monitoring activities and formative evaluation using the detailed performance indicators.&#13;
Additionally, outcome indicators have been identified to guide development impact evaluation (see&#13;
Table 3.1). The above indicators would form the basis of technical supervision by the Bank. Data&#13;
from the detailed performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation (see Annex 5) will be&#13;
incorporated in the semiannual progress reports prepared by the government and submitted to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Bank. During negotiations Government agreed on the indicators to be used to monitor project&#13;
performance and arrangements to collect and analyze the appropriate information.&#13;
3.37   Annual reviews will take place by October of each project year, starting in 1997, and will:&#13;
(a) analyze the previous year's performance and budget execution against project objectives and&#13;
indicators; (b) analyze the proposed workplan and budget for the following year; (c) discuss&#13;
adjustments to be made in the project implementation schedule; and (d) analyze the results of the&#13;
project evaluation. The proposed workplan and budget for the following year will have been&#13;
previously defined at the central and provincial levels and contain a detailed description of targets&#13;
and planned activities (see Annex 5).&#13;
3.38   A comprehensive mid-term review will be conducted in October 1999 to assess project&#13;
performance and initial impact in light of project objectives, project indicators and government&#13;
policies. During negotiations Government agreed to carry out the mid-term review.&#13;
3.39   An implementation completion report is due no later than six months after the closing date of&#13;
the loan. The report is expected to provide a critical overview of project inputs, processes and&#13;
outcomes. The report will summarize: (a) project results and impact on the basis of indicators; (b)&#13;
key project activities and management; (c) lessons learned from project implementation; (d) the&#13;
project's financial status; and (e) implementation issues and recommendations. During negotiations&#13;
agreement was reached on the conduct and content of an implementation completion report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
4.1    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$45.3 million equivalent (Rp. 105.7 billion),&#13;
including contingencies and identifiable taxes and duties. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 summarize the&#13;
estimated costs by component, and project activity and expenditure category. Details are shown in&#13;
Annex 7.&#13;
4.2   Base of Costs Estimates. Baseline costs are estimated at March 1996 prices. Equipment&#13;
costs are based on current prices for similar imported or locally available items.  Costs for&#13;
international and domestic consultants are in line with recent health projects for appropriately&#13;
qualified experts. Operational costs are consistent with current government practices and recent&#13;
health projects. Costs for short-term, in-country training vary depending on the type of training&#13;
being given and location. Recurrent costs are based on standard government allowances for travel,&#13;
per diem, O&amp;M and consumable materials.&#13;
4.3    Contingency Allowances.   Physical contingencies  represent 4 percent and price&#13;
contingencies 17 percent of total baseline costs. Physical contingencies have been allowed for all&#13;
categories, as actual expenditures for all project components are expected to differ from current&#13;
estimates.&#13;
4.4    Foreign Exchange Costs.  Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$12.5 million&#13;
(representing about 28 percent of total project costs) based on the following percentages: (a)&#13;
equipment--79 percent, (b) IEC and instructional materials-- 34 percent, (c) monitoring, surveys and&#13;
studies-- 30 percent; (d) international technical assistance-- 100 percent, (e) overseas fellowships--&#13;
100 percent, (f) local consultants -- 14 percent; and (g) local training-- 15 percent, (h) salt farmers&#13;
development program -- 59 percent; (i) iodine capsules -- 20 per cent; and (j) project administration&#13;
-- 15 percent.&#13;
4.5    Taxes and Duties. Identifiable taxes and duties are estimated at US$ 0.06 million (Rp. 0.14&#13;
billion). These would be financed entirely by the Government of Indonesia.&#13;
B. FINANCING&#13;
4.6    The total project cost of US$45.3 million would be financed by a proposed loan of US$28.5&#13;
million equivalent, covering 63 percent of total project costs. The Government would finance the&#13;
remaining costs of US$16.8 million equivalent from annual budget allocations. Government outlays&#13;
would amount to 37 percent of total project costs (Table 4.3).&#13;

C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.8   The loan proceeds would be used to finance procurement of goods and services under all&#13;
project components except purchase of iodine capsules (see Table 4.4). Procurement of goods would&#13;
be carried out in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and&#13;
IDA Credits" dated January 1995 and revised in January 1996, for the following:&#13;
(a)   Equipment totaling US$0.9 million equivalent including contingencies. Equipment&#13;
will be handled by central and provincial levels depending on where the goods are&#13;
being delivered. Contract packages exceeding US$25,000 will be awarded through&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contract&#13;
packages costing less than US$25,000, in an aggregate not exceeding US$300,000,&#13;
may be procured through national shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(b)   IEC and instructional materials totaling US$4.0 million equivalent including&#13;
contingencies. Given the local language requirements for producing these materials&#13;
or the relatively small sizes of the contracts, contract packages would be awarded&#13;
through NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
(c)   Technical assistance  amounting  to  US$2.0  million  equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies, would be selected and contracted in accordance with Bank Guidelines&#13;
for the Use of Consultants.&#13;
(d)   Monitoring, surveys and research totaling US$10.0 million, including contingencies.&#13;
These services, which will include monitoring of the iodine content of salt and&#13;
provincial surveys of the iodine status of the community, will be provided by&#13;
government departments and universities according to government procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(e)   Overseas and in-country fellowships, local training and workshops totaling US$6.7&#13;
million equivalent, including contingencies. Placement of candidates in foreign&#13;
institutions would be made on the basis of relevance and quality of programs offered,&#13;
cost, and prior experience, according to government procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
(f)    Salt Farmers Development Program totaling US$3.7 million equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies. These will include packages of services to be delivered to particular&#13;
groups of farmers/sharefarmers. These services will be selected and contracted in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants.&#13;
(g)   Project administration totaling US$2.5 million equivalent, including contingencies.&#13;
Project administration will include expenditures directly related to the management&#13;
of the project, such as travel, consumable materials, honoraria, meetings, office&#13;
supplies and operational costs, but excludes salaries. The expenditures would follow&#13;
government procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(h)   Recurrent costs for operational support totaling about US$7.0 million equivalent&#13;
including contingencies. These expenditures will follow standard government&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Procurement Review&#13;
4.9   Review by the Bank would be as follows (see Annex 8):&#13;
(a)   The Bank will review (i) bidding documents for contract packages for goods valued&#13;
at $200,000 or more to be awarded under NCB procedures, (ii) sample bidding&#13;
documents for national competitive bidding (NCB) procurement for goods.&#13;
Approved documents would be used for all future bidding. Sixty to seventy percent&#13;
of goods purchased through the project will be subject to prior review. Post-review&#13;
of approximately 5-10 percent of eligible contracts will be carried out by the&#13;
Resident Mission.&#13;

4.11  Disbursements from  the  loan  for the following  contracts would  be against full&#13;
documentation: (a) consultant services (for firms) contracts valued at or more than US$100,000&#13;
equivalent; and (b) individual consultant contracts valued at or more than $50,000 equivalent; and&#13;
(c) goods contracts valued at or more than $200,000 equivalent. All other disbursements would be&#13;
against statements of expenditure (SOE) for which relevant documents would be retained by&#13;
responsible agencies and made available for review as requested by visiting Bank missions. To&#13;
facilitate disbursement, a Special Account in an amount of US$2.0 million would be established at&#13;
Bank Indonesia. This Special Account would be held in the name of the Director General of Budget,&#13;
Ministry of Finance, following established procedures. The Special Account would be used for all&#13;
eligible foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment to the Special Account would be made on&#13;
the monthly basis or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever occurs first.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

E. ACCOUNTS, AUDITS AND REPORTS&#13;
4.12   MOH would establish separate project accounts for all project expenditures, to be maintained&#13;
in accordance with sound accounting practices. Accounts for the SOEs and Special Account would&#13;
be maintained separately by DG Budget, MOF, for annual audit. The financial statements and&#13;
consolidated financial reports would be audited annually in accordance with Bank guidelines, by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, including a separate audit opinion on SOE&#13;
expenditures. Certified copies of the financial report on the project for each Government fiscal year,&#13;
together with auditors' statements, would be furnished to the bank as soon as available, but not later&#13;
than six months after the end of each government fiscal year starting September 30, 1997. MOH&#13;
would also monitor progress in project implementation and report to the Bank each semester. Within&#13;
six months after the completion of disbursement, the Ministry would submit an implementation&#13;
report (ICR) to the Bank. During negotiations the Government provided assurances that the project&#13;
accounts including the special account and SOE would be audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank and audit reports would be furnished to the Bank within six months of the&#13;
end of the Government 'sfiscal year. Assurances were also received at negotiations that Government&#13;
will carry out technical audits andfurnish reports on them to the Bank.&#13;

5. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. EXPECTED BENEFITS&#13;
5.1    Recent evidence indicates that up to one-half of the Indonesian population are at risk of&#13;
iodine deficiency (i.e. live in areas of the country in which the prevalence of goiter is at least 10&#13;
percent). In areas where iodine deficiency is endemic the probability of a range of physiologic&#13;
effects, which include goiter, mental deficiency, deaf-mutism, spastic diplegia, squint, dwarfism, and&#13;
motor retardation is increased in proportion to the severity of the deficiency. Consequently, there are&#13;
considerable potential benefits, both public and private, from control of IDD. The private benefits&#13;
include higher productivity and wages, and increased investment and risk taking. The public benefits&#13;
derive from reduced costs of medical and custodial care, lower schooling costs resulting from&#13;
reduced absenteeism and lower grade repetition, and higher educational achievement.&#13;
5.2   In principle, translation of these effects into benefits to which can be assigned monetary&#13;
values would allow comparison with the costs of the intervention. Unfortunately, the lack of field&#13;
trials that quantify the various benefits limits the application of cost-benefit to this area for&#13;
Indonesia. However, some illustrative calculations of the effect of control of iodine deficiency can&#13;
be made. Control of iodine deficiency, through its positive effect on mental development, would be&#13;
expected to increase productivity and wages over the productive life of the individual. Assuming that&#13;
this results in a I percent increase in annual wages for the rural population in iodine deficient areas&#13;
(one-third of the population) the IRR for this project is 17 percent. This calculation is sensitive to the&#13;
increase in wages assumed with a 5 percent increase yielding an IRR of 29 percent (see Annex I for&#13;
details). These results are of the same order as those obtained for the benefits of reducing mild iodine&#13;
deficiency in children in Chile (Correa, 1980).&#13;
5.3    Other benefits consequent on the control of iodine deficiency include decreased grade&#13;
repetition in primary school, improved iodine status of women and reduction in the child care burden&#13;
as the number of severely disabled is reduced. Overall, the benefits from controlling iodine&#13;
deficiency considerably exceed the cost.&#13;
B. POVERTY IMPACT&#13;
5.4    This project will contribute to alleviation of poverty in two ways - through its effect on the&#13;
iodine status of the population and through its effect on salt farmers. The successful control of iodine&#13;
deficiency will have significant health and human development benefits for the poor. By ensuring&#13;
that salt is adequately iodized the project will prevent the disability resulting from iodine, itself a&#13;
factor contributing to low incomes. This will be particularly so for those living in iodine deficient&#13;
locations and in isolated areas where poverty is frequently more severe and the availability of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
preventive measures, such as iodized salt, is often limited. The overall effect of this project will&#13;
favor the poor, particularly those in rural areas, who currently are less likely to have access to&#13;
iodized salt than those who are better off and/or who live in urban areas.&#13;
5.5    Small salt farmers/sharefarmers have low incomes which are falling still further. The overall&#13;
effect of this project will be to improve incomes of this group, who have not received institutional&#13;
support in the past, by facilitating exposure to, and adoption of, new management practices and&#13;
technology aimed at improving productivity of those who continue to produce salt and providing&#13;
alternate sources of income for those who move out of salt production.&#13;
5.6    Giving additional weight, as is advocated by some, to the benefits to the poor and vulnerable&#13;
groups would increase the overall benefits of this project.&#13;
C. IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN&#13;
5.7    This project has two main benefits for women. First, it directly addresses a problem which is&#13;
more prevalent in women due to the higher requirements for iodine during pregnancy and lactation.&#13;
As a result, goiter, the primary symptom of iodine deficiency, is more prevalent in females of child&#13;
bearing ages and they will benefit directly from an improved supply of iodine. Second, reductions in&#13;
the incidence of disability (cretinism and milder forms) in children will reduce the childcare burden,&#13;
most of which falls on women. Overall, control of iodine deficiency will have very significant&#13;
benefits for women.&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
5.8    There are no major environmental issues involved in the production of salt from seawater by&#13;
solar evaporation or from its subsequent processing. The project does not entail significant&#13;
opportunities or concerns as regards the environment.&#13;
E. SUSTAINABILITY AND FISCAL IMPACT&#13;
5.9   Sustainability of control of IDD is dependent on maintaining a set of inter-related activities&#13;
as a virtuous circle in which there is: increased competitive pressures in the industry leading to&#13;
increased iodization of salt and lower price differences between the iodized and the unioidized&#13;
product; increased consumer demand due to more knowledgeable consumers and the lower price&#13;
differential; and continuing feedback to the community and the industry on the adequacy of the&#13;
iodine content of salt and of the iodine status of the population through a monitoring and&#13;
surveillance system. This virtuous circle will need to be supported by a credible system of enforcing&#13;
regulations and overall coordination of the inter-ministerial efforts. The project promotes and&#13;
strengthens moves to liberalize the salt industry and ensure that iodization occurs; it will provide, for&#13;
the first time, comprehensive information on the iodine status of the community and the iodine&#13;
content of salt; and it establishes, again for the first time, a mechanism for coordinating the activities&#13;
of the various ministries. Each of these activities will strengthen the impact of the project, act to&#13;
maintain the virtuous circle and increase the likelihood that its effects will continue after the project&#13;
is completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
5.10   Bank estimates of public expenditure for capsules and monitoring of salt prior to the project,&#13;
in the first year of the project and at the end of the project indicate that in the first year of the project&#13;
there will be a substantial increase in public expenditure (see Annex 1). This is largely due to the&#13;
increase in expenditure for monitoring the iodine content of salt. As the project progresses and the&#13;
proportion of salt which is adequately iodized increases, the need for capsules will decrease&#13;
markedly. By the end of the project expenditure on capsules will be approximately half that at the&#13;
beginning. At the same time, expenditure on monitoring the iodine content of salt will increase&#13;
markedly early in the project (from a very low base), will decrease in the latter stages of the project&#13;
but will still be substantially above pre-project levels. Thus, the effect of the project will be to&#13;
increase total expenditure on monitoring salt and "switch" a substantial portion of public expenditure&#13;
from purchase of capsules.&#13;
F. RIsKs&#13;
5.11   The main risks associated with the proposed project relate to the collapse of the virtuous&#13;
circle resulting in a decrease in the benefit flow from the project. This could occur if:&#13;
(a)    There is insufficient demandfor iodized salt due to lack of awareness by consumers&#13;
of the effects of iodine deficiency and the role of iodized salt in its prevention, and&#13;
significant price differences between iodized and uniodized iodized salt. This project&#13;
explicitly aims to create demand for salt through a social marketing campaign. The&#13;
project also supports a range of policy measures to increase efficiency and&#13;
competition in the industry, the effect of which would be a decrease in the marginal&#13;
cost of salt and, together with the social marketing, ensure that the population&#13;
consumes iodized salt.&#13;
(b)    There is limited improvement in the supply of iodized salt. This could occur under&#13;
two circumstances. First, a continuing surplus of low quality salt. And second, failure&#13;
to increase the proportion of processed salt that was iodized. In either case the&#13;
availability of iodized salt will be similar to that which obtains now. The risk of this&#13;
happening is reduced because government has eliminated the floor price, the main&#13;
cause of the chronic surplus of low quality uniodized salt. In addition, monitoring the&#13;
iodine content of salt, the combined database to be maintained by the MOIT, and&#13;
new procedures for enforcing regulations, will result in a very rapid increase in the&#13;
proportion of salt which is adequately iodized.&#13;
(c)    Monitoring of the iodine content of salt and the iodine status of the community will&#13;
lapse. Both these activities are critical to the long term effect of the project because&#13;
they allow monitoring of progress to occur and for the areas in which progress is&#13;
slow to be identified. They are also dependent on government commitment, both in&#13;
terms of resources and organization. The government is very committed to this&#13;
project. In addition, the continuing flow of information will provide a sustained&#13;
stimulus to government to act on what is acknowledged to be a serious problem.&#13;
Finally, the design includes periodic reviews of the overall situation in IDD by an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
independent third party, a mechanism which is designed to build on, and maintain,&#13;
the current high level of commitment by the government to the control of IDD&#13;
(d)   Government coordination of the activities of the various ministries involved will be&#13;
inadequate. The result will be a much lower cost-effectiveness overall. The&#13;
supervision missions by the Bank provide the most effective mechanism to ensure&#13;
that this coordination occurs as the missions will be timed to coincide with six-&#13;
monthly meetings of the National Coordinating Committee to be chaired by&#13;
Bappenas.&#13;
5.12  Each of these risks, and particularly "insufficient demand" and "limited improvement in&#13;
supply" will decrease the coverage of iodized salt, the number of beneficiaries and, therefore, the&#13;
IRR. For example, if only 50 percent of the population were covered the IRR would fall from 17&#13;
percent (para 5.2) to 13 percent. For 25 percent coverage the IRR would be only 9 percent.&#13;
5.13  The project is specifically designed to avoid these risks in the ways described in paragraph&#13;
5.11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1    During negotiations the Government gave assurances that:&#13;
(a)   The GOI will, by January 31, 1997, establish a National IDD Coordination&#13;
Committee, chaired by BAPPENAS. Terms of Reference were agreed at negotiations&#13;
(para 3.23).&#13;
(b)   The GOI will, by January 31, 1997, establish an IDD Project Management Unit.&#13;
Terms of Reference were agreed at negotiations (para 3.27).&#13;
(c)   The GOI will carry out technical audits under Terms of Reference and at a frequency&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, will report to the Bank on the results and respond to matters&#13;
raised by the audit (para 4.12).&#13;
(d)   The GOI will monitor project performance using agreed indicators, collect and&#13;
analyze information needed for such evaluations at an agreed frequency and report&#13;
on the results to the Bank (para 3.36).&#13;
(e)   The GOI will ensure that, until completion of the Project, no floor price for salt and&#13;
iodized salt and no buffer stock of salt is established (para 1.31).&#13;
(f)    The GOI will, not later than June 30, 1998, ensure that all salt produced and/or&#13;
processed by PT Garam for human consumption contains amounts of iodine required&#13;
by the Borrower's relevant national standards (para 1.21).&#13;
(g)   The GOI will, by December 31 of each year, carry out annual reviews of the results&#13;
of the surveys to assess the iodine status of the community and the monitoring of&#13;
iodine levels in salt to determine whether use of capsules can be reduced in&#13;
subsequent years (para 3.20).&#13;
(h)   The GOI will carry out mid-term and project completion reviews and report on the&#13;
results to the Bank (para 3.38 and 3.39). In the mid-term review particular attention&#13;
will be paid to assessing overall project strategy, the efficacy of targeting and&#13;
interventions and whether more rapid reductions in tariffs on salt than are currently&#13;
planned would improve the iodine status of various segments of the population.&#13;
(i)    The GOI will ensure that a review of existing regulations relating to salt and iodized&#13;
salt is completed no later than June 30, 1998, with the aim of updating the&#13;
regulations as necessary to specify minimum standards for salt and iodized salt (para&#13;
3.15).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
(j)    The GOI will ensure that periodic independent reviews of the iodine status of the&#13;
population and of the effectiveness of the IDD control program are carried out and&#13;
that the results of the first review are available by October 31, 1998 (para 3.24).&#13;
(k)    The GOI will, not later than December 31, 1998, take all measures necessary to&#13;
remove the internal non-tariff barriers to the trade in iodized salt and salt for human&#13;
consumption (para 1.31).&#13;
(I)    The GOI will ensure that procurement of iodized oil capsules is undertaken only as&#13;
required for the Project (para 3.20).&#13;
6.2    Subject to the above agreements, the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$28.5&#13;
million to the Republic of Indonesia under standard amortization terms, grace period and interest&#13;
rate for a US dollar single currency fixed rate loan with an expected disbursement period of 3 to 6&#13;
years.&#13;

Intensified Iodine Deficiency Control Project&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF INTERVENTIONS TO CONTROL&#13;
IODINE DEFICIENCY&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
This annex reports on the economic analysis carried out for this project. It contains the&#13;
following sections - rationale for government involvement; estimates of the size of the problem of&#13;
iodine deficiency; analysis of alternatives for control of iodine deficiency, cost-benefit analysis,&#13;
institutional analysis, sustainability and fiscal impact; poverty impact; implications for women;&#13;
environmental impact; and risks.&#13;
2. RATIONALE FOR GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN CONTROL OF IDD&#13;
There are three reasons for government involvement in the control of iodine deficiency&#13;
disorders (IDD). First, those who live in iodine deficient areas frequently have difficulty in drawing&#13;
the connection between iodine deficiency and its consequences. Often they have no access to&#13;
information about the deficiency from which they suffer or to the supplies of iodine needed to&#13;
restore their iodine status. Government intervention may be the most cost efficient method of&#13;
delivering both the information and the iodine. Second, the poor frequently can not or will not pay&#13;
the higher price for the vehicles governments use to deliver extra iodine, such as iodized salt. Poor&#13;
women may be particularly vulnerable. Government has a role here through public programs which&#13;
in effect transfer income to the poor in order to ensure that they have access to the additional iodine&#13;
needed. And third, there may be significant externalities to be derived from the control of IDD. In&#13;
areas where iodine deficiency is endemic the probability of a range of physiologic effects, which&#13;
include goiter, mental deficiency ranging in severity from mild to severe, and a range of neurologic&#13;
defects (e.g., deaf-mutism, spastic diplegia, squint, and motor retardation) is increased in proportion&#13;
to the severity of the deficiency. At least some of the costs of caring for those affected must be&#13;
borne by the society at large. To the extent that this is true control of iodine deficiency will result in&#13;
externalities. In addition, iodine deficiency limits cognitive development, decreases the public&#13;
returns to schooling and increases educational costs due to absenteeism, grade repetition and lower&#13;
achievement. Again, these costs are borne at least in part, by society. And again, controlling iodine&#13;
deficiency will result in externalities. Overall, there are very significant extemalities to the control of&#13;
iodine deficiency&#13;
This rationale and pattern of government involvement is consistent with the Bank's Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia, which was presented to the Board on March 21, 1995, and&#13;
the CAS Progress Report discussed by the Board on June 6, 1996. The control of iodine deficiency is&#13;
consistent with the emphasis in the CAS on the importance of human resource development to&#13;
promote economic growth, competitiveness, and structural transformation, and on a more selective,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

efficient use of public resources. In particular, the CAS notes that considerable scope exists to&#13;
improve the quality of health services through better resource use.&#13;
In the last six years the Bank has engaged in a comprehensive dialogue with MOH and&#13;
Bappenas on the problems of controlling IDD. This dialogue, which recently has been extended to&#13;
include MOIT, has drawn the attention of the government to the need for a comprehensive policy&#13;
with emphasis on sustainable solutions, the importance of current and reliable information on the&#13;
IDD status of the population in all provinces, the short term nature of intervention strategies based&#13;
on iodized oil, and the important potential role of iodized salt. In addition, recent sector work by the&#13;
Bank has reemphasized to government the problems with its current efforts and concluded that the&#13;
IDD problem is considerably larger than was previously thought.&#13;
3. ESTIMATES OF THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM&#13;
The population "at risk" of iodine deficiency is conventionally defined as those people&#13;
living in areas in which the prevalence of endemic goiter is at least 10 percent, and this definition&#13;
has been used in Indonesia. Current estimates of the population at risk (those living in areas in which&#13;
the goiter prevalence is at least 10 percent) are based on the results of the 1980-82 goiter survey.&#13;
Based on these figures it is estimated by the Ministry of Health that 17 percent of the Indonesian&#13;
population are living in endemic areas.&#13;
However, there are many limitations to this estimate due to the sampling procedures used in&#13;
the 1980/82 survey. Approximately one-quarter of the 3349 kecamatan defined at the time were&#13;
included in the survey. Kecamatan included in the survey were chosen on the basis of a visit to the&#13;
market by the local doctor. If at least 5 visible goiters were detected the kecamatan was classified as&#13;
having endemic iodine deficiency and a survey carried out. Those kecamatan not included in the&#13;
survey were classified as non-endemic.&#13;
Thus, to the extent that the "non-endemic" kecamatan do in fact have appreciable levels of&#13;
iodine deficiency the 1980/82 database is an inadequate tool for estimating prevalence. Because all&#13;
subsequent surveys to date have been based on the sampling frame set at the time of the 1980/82&#13;
survey it is not possible to estimate the extent of this inadequacy for Indonesia as a whole.&#13;
Recent GOI/Bank analysis for East Java, where additional information is available, indicates&#13;
that while most (80 percent) of the kecamatan selected on the basis of the 1980/82 survey had a&#13;
serious iodine problem, there were even more kecamatan with a serious problem amongst those not&#13;
surveyed. Using the 1980/82 data as the basis for estimating overall prevalence seriously&#13;
underestimates the size of the problem in Indonesia.&#13;
Given that the information base is poor, to the point where it is misleading, is it possible to&#13;
provide even broad estimates of the size of the problem in Indonesia? This question has been&#13;
approached from two different angles - first, utilizing more recent small scale surveys to determine&#13;
the extent to which the current information underestimates the size of the population "at risk" of&#13;
iodine deficiency; and second, based on these revised estimates, to determine the contribution of&#13;
iodine deficiency to the overall Burden of Disease in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 13&#13;
During project preparation, estimates of the extent of the underestimate were made for the&#13;
most populous province, East Java, by collating the results of all smaller surveys at the kecamatan&#13;
level since the 1982 survey. On the basis of these additional surveys the "at risk" population rises to&#13;
50 percent. But even this is an underestimate as 206 kecamatan are still to be surveyed. Thus,&#13;
between one-half and two-thirds of the population of East Java are "at risk" of IDD, 3 to 4 times the&#13;
previous estimate.&#13;
Similar data are not yet available for other provinces. By the end of 1996 data collected&#13;
under CHN3 will be available for Central and West Java, Maluku, NTT and Irian Jaya. For the&#13;
remaining provinces the information will be collected under the project proposed here.&#13;
In the interim we have conservatively estimated that at least one-third of the population of&#13;
Indonesia is "at risk" of iodine deficiency and this estimate is used in all further calculations. In&#13;
comparison the proportion of the population "at risk of iodine deficiency in China is 33 percent and&#13;
in the Philippines 50 percent.&#13;
Burden of Disease in Indonesia due to Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD). A second&#13;
approach to determining the importance of iodine deficiency is to estimate its contribution to the&#13;
overall Burden of Disease to allow IDD to be placed in the context of other health problems. The&#13;
effects of iodine deficiency are diverse, ranging from increased mortality through severe disability to&#13;
milder levels of impairment. There are difficulties in combining the effects of all these sequelae of&#13;
iodine deficiency in a single index of the effect of iodine deficiency on the community. One&#13;
approach is to calculate their contribution to the total "burden of disease and disability" (BOD). The&#13;
BOD is measured in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost, to which each of the&#13;
effects of iodine deficiency contributes.&#13;
The DALYs lost due to IDD in Indonesia were estimated following the methods of the 1993&#13;
World Development Report on "Investing in Health" (see Murray, 1994). This yielded the results&#13;
shown in Table 1.&#13;
Thus, IDD is responsible for 27 DALYs per 1000 population per year - an important&#13;
contributor to the overall burden. The World Bank and WHO (World Bank, 1993) estimate the total&#13;
burden due to all diseases in the "Other Asia and Islands" region (of which Indonesia is the most&#13;
populous member) to be 258 DALY per 1000 population. Assuming the total burden in Indonesia to&#13;
be similar to that of the regions as a whole, IDD contributes of the order of 10 percent of the total. In&#13;
areas where iodine deficiency is endemic the burden due to iodine deficiency will contribute up to&#13;
20 percent of the total burden indicating that it is one of the most significant of all health problems&#13;
in those locations.&#13;

Assumptions for Burden of Disease calculations&#13;
1.  Assume that one-third of the population of Indonesia is "at risk" of iodine deficiency.&#13;
2.  IDD contributes to DALYs lost in three ways - first, premature death, mainly in the neonatal period; second, through disability in cretins;&#13;
and third, through mild disability in the general population.&#13;
3.  The total number of births in a year is calculated based on a total population for Indonesia of 190, 178,000 and a crude birth rate of 23 per&#13;
1000 population (DHS, 1995 - Table 3.1, p 40).&#13;
4.  One-third of these births are assumed to be in an iodine deficient area.&#13;
5.  The neonatal mortality rate is 29 per 1000 live births (DHS, 1995 - Table 9.4, p 10).&#13;
6.  Assume one-quarter of the neonatal deaths in the iodine deficient area are due to iodine deficiency.&#13;
7.  Assume that 1% of the bitths in the iodine deficient area are cretins and that their life expectancy is similar to other members of the&#13;
community.&#13;
8.  The remainder of the births have, on average, the mildest level of disability as specified in Murray (1994).&#13;
4. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES FOR CONTROL OF IODINE DEFICIENCY&#13;
Given the significant externalities to be derived from control of IDD and the magnitude of&#13;
the problem, to what instruments should government expenditure be directed? The instruments&#13;
available to governments for the control of iodine deficiency during the last 10 years are iodized oil&#13;
injections, iodized oil capsules and iodized salt. In the last 5 years Indonesia has used each of these&#13;
methods. The majority of budgetary allocations for control of iodine deficiency have been through&#13;
the MOH for purchase and distribution of iodized oil injections and capsules and some IEC directed&#13;
specifically to iodine deficiency. Allocations of public money for improving the supply of iodized&#13;
salt have been minimal. Although injections are no longer used they have been included here for&#13;
comparison with the capsules which recently replaced them. In the analysis which follows (see Table&#13;
2), each method has been treated independently and only the public costs for each method have been&#13;
included.&#13;
The high cost per DALY saved for injections and capsules is due to the low coverage of both&#13;
methods. Injections had a higher coverage than capsules largely because they provide coverage for 4&#13;
years compared to 1 year for capsules. Consequently, their cost per DALY saved is lower. However,&#13;
a chronic shortage of needles and their consequent reuse meant that oil injections were a possible&#13;
means of transmission of hepatitis B and AIDS. As a result a decision was taken in 1993 to cease&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

using injections. Nevertheless, both remain expensive methods for controlling iodine deficiency due&#13;
to the low coverage.&#13;

Assumptions&#13;
1. The total Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost due to IDD were estimated as shown in Table 1.&#13;
2. The coverage of each of the interventions was estimated from Ministry of Health Records for recent years. In the case of injections, the use&#13;
of which ceased in 1992, the records for 1991 were used to calculate coverage.&#13;
3. Injections were, and capsules are, both delivered through the health system and utilize the same facilities and staff - hence the costs are the&#13;
same. Only the public costs are included here. They were estimated from information supplied by the Ministry of Health..&#13;
4. Costs of iodized salt are all public costs and include the cost of monitoring the iodine levels in salt and of enforcement and are based on&#13;
estimates derived from discussions with govemment officials.&#13;
The majority of DALYs are contributed by the large number of people suffering from mild&#13;
levels of disability. Consequently more DALYs are gained by broad coverage in areas where iodine&#13;
deficiency is endemic, than by narrowly targeted programs. Public expenditure for iodized salt is by&#13;
far the most cost-effective method of controlling iodine deficiency. However, it is important to keep&#13;
in mind that the effectiveness of this public expenditure on salt is dependent on a much larger private&#13;
expenditure on iodized salt. Conversely, the effectiveness of private expenditure is dependent on&#13;
complementary public expenditure to guarantee that the product which claims to be iodized actually&#13;
is. As government regulation of the industry has been minimal, up to half of this private expenditure&#13;
was for salt that was not adequately iodized, even though much of it claimed to be. Current&#13;
government efforts place very little emphasis on increasing demand for iodized salt. Further&#13;
expenditure to achieve this would be justified and has the potential to increase effectiveness with a&#13;
relatively smal] additional cost.&#13;
Overall, iodized salt is by far the most cost-effective method of controlling iodine deficiency.&#13;
However, there will be some areas where the iodine deficiency is very severe or the availability of&#13;
iodized salt is low. It is in these situations that the more expensive capsules have a role, providing&#13;
protection from iodine deficiency in the short to medium term while supplies of adequately iodized&#13;
salt are secured.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                                         Annex 1&#13;
Page 6 of 13&#13;
The implications of the cost-effectiveness analysis for Indonesia are that:&#13;
1. Private expenditure (the incremental cost of purchasing iodized, rather than uniodized,&#13;
salt) will be the main method of financing control of iodine deficiency.&#13;
2. Public expenditure for iodized salt should be concentrated on ensuring that salt is&#13;
adequately iodized through introducing appropriate regulations and ensuring that they&#13;
are enforced, and on increasing demand for iodized salt..&#13;
3. Public expenditure on iodized oil should be limited to geographic areas where iodine&#13;
deficiency is very severe and where distribution of iodized salt is not possible.&#13;
4. Given the history of the effort to control iodine deficiency in Indonesia, it is vital that&#13;
high quality information on the iodine status of the community is collected periodically&#13;
to allow targeting of iodized oil and evaluation of the effect of interventions. This will be&#13;
dependent on public expenditure.&#13;
Accommodating these implications means that a revised strategy is needed. The overall&#13;
effect of such a revision would be a rapid improvement in the iodine status of the community as a&#13;
result of increased consumption of adequately iodized salt and the specific targeting of a limited&#13;
number of capsules to areas of greatest need. A comparison of this revised approach with "business&#13;
as usual" and the outcomes they could be expected to produce, is summarized in Table 3.&#13;
Overall, compared to "business as usual", the project approach will lead to an industry which&#13;
is more reliant on the private sector, has approximately 30 percent less farmers, those farmers who&#13;
remain will have higher productivity, a better quality product and improved welfare; the&#13;
environment in which the industry operates will be more competitive and there will be more pressure&#13;
to innovate; the quality of salt produced will improve, processing costs will be decreasing as will the&#13;
difference in price between iodized and uniodized salt; the proportion of the population consuming&#13;
adequately iodized salt will be high; and the use of capsules will decrease.&#13;

5. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS&#13;
Given the project proposed, whose dimensions and instruments have been outlined above&#13;
(see Chapter 3 of Staff Appraisal Report), are the returns adequate to justify investment of public&#13;
funds? There are considerable potential benefits, both public and private, from control of IDD. The&#13;
private benefits include higher productivity and wages, and increased investment and risk taking.&#13;
The public benefits derive from reduced costs of medical and custodial care, lower schooling costs&#13;
resulting from reduced absenteeism and lower grade repetition, and higher educational achievement.&#13;
In principle, translation of these effects into benefits to which can be assigned monetary&#13;
values would allow comparison with the costs of the intervention. Unfortunately, the lack of field&#13;
trials that quantify the various public benefits limits the application of cost-benefit to this area for&#13;
Indonesia. However, some illustrative calculations of the effect of control of iodine deficiency on&#13;
individual benefits can be made. Control of iodine deficiency, through its positive effect on mental&#13;
development, would be expected to increase productivity and wages over the productive life of the&#13;
individual. We assumed that this results in either a 1 percent or a 5 percent increase in annual wages&#13;
for the rural population in iodine deficient areas (one-third of the population). As the IRR will also&#13;
vary with the length of the period over which benefits are assumed to accrue, we assumed 30, 45 and&#13;
60 year periods. The calculations do not assign any benefits to those who died before age 30, 45 and&#13;
60, respectively. Other benefits consequent on the control of iodine deficiency, and not included in&#13;
this calculation, include increased primary and secondary school enrollment and achievement,&#13;
improved iodine status of women and reduction in the child care burden as the number of severely&#13;
disabled is reduced.&#13;
The rates of return for 30, 45 and 60 years periods and a 1 percent and 5 percent increase in&#13;
the average wage are shown in Table 4.&#13;
Table 4. Rates of Return to Project Investments by Time and Magnitude of Wage Increment&#13;

60 years             17.24%         29.04%&#13;
Assumptions for cost-benefit analysis&#13;
1. The benefits result from a 1% or a 5% increase in average wages from ages 15-60 years.&#13;
2. The wage rate is the average rural wage rate.&#13;
3. One-third of the population are "at risk" of iodine deficiency.&#13;
4. The beneficiaries are one-third of the children born in the 5 years of the project calculated from the 1995 population estimates adjusted for&#13;
population growth rate (1.48%) and using the estimated birthrate of 22.8 per 1000 population. This estimate is adjusted for mortality to yield&#13;
survivors to ages 30, 45 and 60 using the following values of l(x), the probability of surviving from birth to age x, - 1(30)=.86189;&#13;
1(45)=.80822; and 1(60)=.67018.&#13;
5. Benefits are for the years 15 through 60 years after the project commences.&#13;
6. Total benefits are calculated as the product of 1% of the average rural wage rate and the total number of beneficiaries in any given year.&#13;
7. The costs are the total cost of the project spread evenly over the first 5 years.&#13;
8. The estimates are obtained by solving for the internal rate of return that equates a stream of costs of the investment over a 5 year period and&#13;
the  estimated  benefits to  the  cohort born  in  the  5 years of the  project over the ensuing  30,45  or 60  years.&#13;

Thus, the IRR for this project is 17 percent (1 percent increase in wages and 30 year period).&#13;
As is expected, the results are more sensitive to variation in the increment in wages than to an&#13;
increase in the period over which the benefits are calculated.. These results are of the same order as&#13;
those obtained for the benefits of reducing mild iodine deficiency in children in Chile (Correa,&#13;
1980).&#13;
As explained above, the total benefits, and the IRR, are underestimated. Overall, the benefits&#13;
from controlling iodine deficiency can be expected to considerably exceed the cost.&#13;
6. INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS&#13;
The main institutional players in control of iodine deficiency are government departments,&#13;
specifically Bappenas, MOIT, MOH, and MOHA. The failure of IDD control efforts in the past are&#13;
largely due to failures of coordination between these ministries, initially to formulate a coherent and&#13;
coordinated strategy and subsequently to implement technically sound programs in a coordinated&#13;
manner. As a result, ministries have largely gone their own way with little coordination. MOH has&#13;
placed primary emphasis on injections and capsules but failed to provide reliable information on the&#13;
distribution and extent of the iodine deficiency problem. MOIT has increased its commitment to salt&#13;
but essentially in isolation from the MOH effort. MOHA has not been involved in any substantial&#13;
way and Bappenas has not been able to concentrate on the decisions necessary to formulate an&#13;
overall policy or to coordinate the effort. All ministries have failed to communicate the urgency of&#13;
the problem to the public.&#13;
In addition, all ministries lack the technical skills required for detailed policy formulation,&#13;
reliable survey design and execution, and the provision of technical assistance to the salt industry for&#13;
either salt production or processing.&#13;
Government has, at various times and frequently in response to outside agencies, tried to&#13;
increase the priority accorded control of IDD. But most outside pressure has been narrowly and&#13;
technically based, has worked with one ministry or the other, and has consequently failed to assist&#13;
government to make a comprehensive assessment of the situation. Outside agencies have also failed&#13;
to provide government with the long term support or the resources needed to improve the iodine&#13;
situation on a sustainable basis, and have ignored the institutional issues.&#13;
The strategy adopted for this project has been to work with government to arrive at a&#13;
systematic view of the technical and institutional issues and their implications for improved&#13;
interventions. This has involved bringing the parties together, promoting a coordinated approach to&#13;
analysis of the situation and design of the project through facilitation of technical assistance.&#13;
In the past few resources have gone to ensuring that salt is adequately iodized, that reliable&#13;
information on the iodine status of the community was available or that the community was&#13;
informed about iodine deficiency and means of its control. Considerable resources were directed to&#13;
provision of capsules. And coordination between ministries was minimal. The lack of coordination&#13;
and absence of information meant that there was little accountability and no incentives to determine&#13;
if progress toward elimination of iodine deficiency was occurring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

With this institutional background, this project concentrates on establishing a coordination&#13;
mechanism and improving the implementation capacity of the various ministries and assisting MOH&#13;
and MOIT to fund project-related activities.&#13;
Bappenas is the only ministry with the authority to coordinate inter-ministerial efforts. This&#13;
project will:&#13;
provide resources for coordination meetings and procurement of technical assistance to&#13;
assess technical issues cutting across ministries&#13;
The MOH has considerable experience in implementing national programs through&#13;
provincial health offices. The Director of Nutrition is enthusiastic about this project and has made&#13;
staff available to assist with project preparation and to facilitate administrative issues in the pre-&#13;
project period. In Health Education competent staff with experience in national social marketing&#13;
campaigns have been assigned to the project and they have responded well to technical inputs during&#13;
project preparation. The project will:&#13;
* provide complementary inputs, particularly funds and technical assistance, in IDD&#13;
surveys, evaluation of the role of capsules and health education,&#13;
* assist with regular policy and program reviews&#13;
* provide training for staff to strengthen their capacity to monitor changes in iodine status&#13;
of the community and determine the implications for program content&#13;
The MOIT has been the most active group in recent years. The Director responsible for the&#13;
salt industry has raised the priority accorded to iodization of salt and signaled to industry that&#13;
government intends to give substance to the primary role of iodized salt in control of iodine&#13;
deficiency. However, this endeavor lacks resources and technical expertise to complement his&#13;
commitment and energy. The project will:&#13;
* provide resources for monitoring the iodine content of salt and enforcing regulations&#13;
* establish a joint database on the iodine content of salt&#13;
* assist salt farmers/sharefarmers to improve the quality of salt produced and identify&#13;
alternatives to salt production&#13;
*  provide training of staff to strengthen their technical capacity in salt production and&#13;
iodization&#13;
The MOHA has considerable experience in mobilization of populations at the provincial and&#13;
sub-provincial levels in support of government programs. However, it also lacks resources for this&#13;
particular effort and they will be provided through the project.&#13;
An important factor in ensuring the success of this project will be strong and consistent&#13;
supervision which directs particular attention to prompting government to coordinate the various&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;

7. SUSTAINABILITY AND FISCAL IMPACT&#13;
Sustainable control of IDD is dependent on maintaining a set of inter-related activities as a&#13;
virtuous circle in which there is: increased competitive pressures in the industry leading to increased&#13;
iodization of salt and lower price differences between the iodized and the unioidized product;&#13;
increased consumer demand due to more knowledgeable consumers and the lower price differential;&#13;
and continuing feedback to the community and the industry on the adequacy of the iodine content of&#13;
salt and of the iodine status of the population through a monitoring and surveillance system. This&#13;
virtuous circle will need to be supported by a credible system of enforcing regulations and overall&#13;
coordination of the inter-ministerial efforts. The project promotes and strengthens moves to&#13;
liberalize the salt industry and ensure that iodization occurs; it will provide, for the first time,&#13;
comprehensive information on the iodine status of the community and the iodine content of salt; and&#13;
it establishes, again for the first time, a mechanism for coordinating the activities of the various&#13;
ministries. Each of these activities will strengthen the impact of the project, act to maintain the&#13;
virtuous circle and increase the likelihood that its effects will continue after the project is completed.&#13;
Bank estimates of public expenditure for capsules and monitoring of salt prior to the project,&#13;
in the first year of the project and at the end of the project are shown in Table 5. They indicate that&#13;
in the first year of the project there will be a substantial increase in public expenditure. This is&#13;
largely due to the increase in expenditure for monitoring the iodine content of salt. As the project&#13;
progresses and the proportion of salt which is adequately iodized increases, the need for capsules&#13;
will decrease markedly. By the end of the project expenditure on capsules will be approximately half&#13;
that at the beginning. At the same time, expenditure on monitoring the iodine content of salt will&#13;
increase markedly early in the project (from a very low base), will decrease in the latter stages of the&#13;
project but will still be substantially above pre-project levels. Thus, the effect of the project will be&#13;
to increase total expenditure on monitoring salt and "switch" a substantial portion of public&#13;
expenditure from purchase of capsules.&#13;

8. POVERTY IMPACT&#13;
This project will contribute to alleviation of poverty in two ways - through its effect on the&#13;
iodine status of the population and through its effect on salt farmers. The successful control of iodine&#13;
deficiency will have significant health and human development benefits for the poor. By ensuring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48                                        Annex I&#13;
Page 12 of 13&#13;
that salt is adequately iodized the project will prevent the disability resulting from iodine, itself a&#13;
factor contributing to low incomes. This will be particularly so for those living in iodine deficient&#13;
locations and in isolated areas where poverty is frequently more severe and the availability of&#13;
preventive measures, such as iodized salt, is often limited. The overall effect of this project will&#13;
favor the poor, particularly those in rural areas, who currently are less likely to have access to&#13;
iodized salt than those who are better off and/or who live in urban areas.&#13;
Small salt farmers/sharefarmers have low incomes which are falling still further. The overall&#13;
effect of this project will be to improve incomes of this group, who have not received institutional&#13;
support in the past, by facilitating exposure to, and adoption of, new management practices and&#13;
technology aimed at improving productivity of those who continue to produce salt and providing&#13;
alternate sources of income for those who move out of salt production.&#13;
Giving additional weight, as is advocated by some, to the benefits to the poor and the&#13;
vulnerable groups would increase the overall benefits from this project.&#13;
9. IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN&#13;
This project has two main benefits for women. First, it directly addresses a problem which is&#13;
more prevalent in women due to the higher requirements for iodine during pregnancy and lactation.&#13;
As a result, goiter, the primary symptom of iodine deficiency, is more prevalent in females of child&#13;
bearing ages and they will benefit directly from an improved supply of iodine. Second, reductions in&#13;
the incidence of disability (cretinism and milder forms) in children will reduce the childcare burden,&#13;
most of which falls on women. Overall, control of iodine deficiency will have very significant&#13;
benefits for women.&#13;
10. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
There are no major environmental issues involved in the production of salt from seawater by&#13;
solar evaporation or from its subsequent processing. The project does not entail significant&#13;
opportunities or concerns as regards the environment.&#13;
11. RISKS&#13;
The main risks associated with the proposed project relate to the collapse of the virtuous&#13;
circle resulting in a decrease in the benefit flow from the project. This could occur if:&#13;
(a)    There is insufficient demand for iodized salt due lack of awareness by consumers of&#13;
the effects of iodine deficiency and the role of iodized salt in its prevention, and&#13;
significant price differences between iodized and uniodized salt. This project&#13;
explicitly aims to create demand for salt through a social marketing campaign. The&#13;
project also supports a range of policy measures to increase efficiency and&#13;
competition in the industry, the effect of which would be a decrease in the marginal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49                                    Annex I&#13;
Page 13 of 13&#13;
cost of salt and, together with the social marketing, ensure that the population&#13;
consume iodized salt.&#13;
(b)    There is limited improvement in the supply of iodized salt. This could occur under&#13;
two circumstances. First, a continuing surplus of low quality salt. And second, failure&#13;
to increase the proportion of processed salt that was iodized. In either case the&#13;
availability of iodized salt will be similar to that which obtains now. The risk of this&#13;
happening is reduced because government has eliminated the floor price, the main&#13;
cause of the chronic surplus of low quality uniodized salt. In addition, monitoring the&#13;
iodine content of salt, the combined database to be maintained by the MOIT, and&#13;
new procedures for enforcing regulations, will result in a very rapid increase in the&#13;
proportion of salt which is adequately iodized.&#13;
(c)    Monitoring of the iodine content of salt and the iodine status of the community will&#13;
lapse. Both these activities are critical to the long term effect of the project because&#13;
they allow monitoring of progress to occur and for the areas in which progress is&#13;
slow to be identified. They are also dependent on government commitment, both in&#13;
terms of resources and organization. The government is very committed to this&#13;
project. In addition, the continuing flow of information will provide a sustained&#13;
stimulus to government to act on what is acknowledged to be a serious problem.&#13;
Beyond the government, the private sector is also explicitly included, for the first&#13;
time, in the activities to be carried out. Finally, the design includes periodic reviews&#13;
of the overall situation in IDD by an independent third party, a mechanism which is&#13;
designed to build on, and maintain, the current high level of commitment by the&#13;
government to the control of IDD.&#13;
(d)   Government coordination of the activities of the various ministries involved will be&#13;
inadequate. The result will be a much lower cost-effectiveness overall. The&#13;
supervision missions by the Bank provide the most effective opportunity to ensure&#13;
that this coordination occurs as the missions will be timed to coincide with six-&#13;
monthly meetings of the National Coordinating Committee to be chaired by&#13;
Bappenas.&#13;
Each of these risks, and particularly "insufficient demand" and "limited improvement in&#13;
supply" will decrease the coverage of iodized salt, the number of beneficiaries and, therefore, the&#13;
IRR. For example, if only 50 percent of the population were covered the IRR would fall from 17&#13;
percent to 13 percent. For 25 percent coverage the IRR would be only 9 percent.&#13;
(e)    The wage effect will be less than indicated. The cost-benefit analysis indicates that&#13;
the IRR is sensitive to the size of the wage improvement. If the wage effect is less than has&#13;
been assumed the benefits will be correspondingly less. On the other hand, the IRR is&#13;
relatively insensitive to assumptions about the length of the period over which the benefits&#13;
will accrue. Consequently, a delay in the manifestation of benefits will not appreciably&#13;
reduce the IRR.&#13;

Intensified Iodine Deficiency Control Project&#13;
THE SALT INDUSTRY IN INDONESIA&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
This Annex presents information on the salt industry in nine sections - demand,&#13;
production, processing, marketing and distribution, monitoring and enforcement, a summary&#13;
of the industry to date, recent changes in the industry, and issues for further development of&#13;
the industry.&#13;
2. DEMAND FOR SALT&#13;
It is estimated that about 3 kg of salt is consumed per person per year in Indonesia (a&#13;
total national demand for human consumption of 600,000 tons) and this is increasing by 2.3&#13;
percent a year through population growth. A further 300,000 tons of salt is used in fisheries,&#13;
other food processing and the leather industry. There may be some scope for increased use of&#13;
salt for the processing of foods if exports expand. The needs of the chemical industries&#13;
(450,000 tons) are met by high quality imports. However, industry sources estimate that up&#13;
to 100,000 tons of the imported industrial salt is eventually sold for human consumption.&#13;
3. SALT PRODUCTION&#13;
Salt is produced by the state-owned company, PT Gram, and a large number of&#13;
independent, small producers from solar evaporation of seawater in the dry season (July to&#13;
December) with peak production in October. PT Garam produces salt only on the island of&#13;
Madura where it has 6500 ha of salt ponds and, depending on weather conditions, produces&#13;
200,000 to 300,000 tons per year. PT Garam produces salt by fractional crystallization&#13;
resulting, overall, in higher quality salt than that produced by small farmers. The majority of&#13;
salt, approximately 800,000 to 900,000 tons per year, is produced by 25,000 to 30,000 small&#13;
producers (people's salt), of whom 90 percent are in Java, from an estimated 20,000 ha of&#13;
land. Approximately half the total production is in East Java. The other significant sites of&#13;
production are in Central Java, West Java and South Sulawesi. Small amounts are produced&#13;
from minor salt fields in DI Aceh and Nusa Tenggara Timor.&#13;
Overall information on salt farmers/sharefarmers is limited. The most comprehensive&#13;
view is provided by a survey of 225 salt farm owners, leaseholders, sharecroppers and&#13;
laborers in Madura, the largest salt producing area in the country, carried out as part of&#13;
project preparation. The "average" farm was 2 ha in size (excluding the 3 largest producers&#13;
with farms up to 30 ha in size) and situated 2 km from a paved road. The "average" farmer&#13;
was 42 years of age with 4.8 years of primary education. Less than half were members of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

cooperative and only 20 percent had had any contact with GOI agencies about salt&#13;
production.&#13;
Production technology is very basic and salt yields, averaging 55 tons/ha/year, are&#13;
low by comparison with other producers in the region such as Thailand where small&#13;
producers average approximately 100 tons/ha per year.&#13;
Average costs and returns to salt production on Madura are shown below:&#13;
Average farm size (ha)                     2&#13;
Average production (t/farm/season)        95&#13;
Average farmgate price (Rplkg)            15&#13;
Average gross income (Rp)           1,129,000&#13;
Average total cash cost (Rp)         655,000&#13;
Operating profit (Rp/farm)           474,000&#13;
Operating profit (Rp/ha)             237,000&#13;

Thus, returns to salt production are modest. The estimated monthly income&#13;
(assuming a five month season) to a 2 ha farm is approximately Rp 95,000 (Rp 47,000 per&#13;
ha), less than other agricultural occupations and less than wages in construction or industry.&#13;
These figures are for the farm as a whole and describe the situation of the landowner.&#13;
Sharefarmers usually receive one-third to one-half of the value of sales. Thus, their earnings&#13;
will typically be around Rp 35,000 per month. Laborer's incomes from work on salt farms&#13;
average approximately Rp 3,000 per day. They typically work 10-12 days per month&#13;
yielding monthly incomes of Rp 25,000 to Rp 30,000.&#13;
Each of the groups engaged in salt production also derive income form non-salt&#13;
activities. The relative importance of various sources of income for each group is shown&#13;
below:&#13;

Most people's salt is sold locally to traders or cooperatives (KUD). In Madura, the largest&#13;
salt field in the country, only two private sector companies and PT Garam will purchase&#13;
people's salt in the 1996 season. They wash the salt (and possibly iodize it) and sell on to&#13;
smaller processors to package, and possibly iodize, the product. These three companies also&#13;
compete for contracts to supply salt to various industries and have recently exported small&#13;
volumes of salt to other ASEAN countries. In Central and West Java the quality of the salt is&#13;
lower, the number of traders is higher, and the processing capacity of the average firm&#13;
smaller, than in Madura.&#13;
&#13;

The government owned salt company, PT Garam, has a central role in the industry.&#13;
In addition to its role as a major producer and processor, between 1977 and 1993 PT Garam&#13;
was also responsible for administering a floor price for people's salt and maintaining a&#13;
national stockpile. The floor price, designed to increase the income of farmers/sharefarmers,&#13;
was based on the Regional Minimum Wage. It was unrealistically high and drew many new&#13;
farmers/sharefarmers into the industry. The resulting surplus was stockpiled. When the floor&#13;
price ended in 1993 there was approximately 1 million tons of salt in the stock, some of&#13;
which was 10 years old.&#13;
The 1995 production costs for PT Garam, which produces 25 percent of domestic salt&#13;
production, are as follows:&#13;
Rp/kg&#13;
Production (farmgate)                    34&#13;
Bags and bagging                         11&#13;

F.O.B.(Madura)                            90&#13;
In comparison to PT Garam's production costs, the average farmgate price for&#13;
people's salt in 1995 was 15 Rp/kg, down from approximately 30 Rp/kg in the last year of&#13;
the floor price scheme in 1993. The farmgate price is likely to remain low as PT Garam is&#13;
still holding approximately 200,000 tons of the former national stock and some&#13;
farmers/sharefarmers have stored their production from the 1995 season in the hope of higher&#13;
prices in 1996. As a further point of comparison, in 1993 the landed value (excluding import&#13;
duty) of bulk, high quality industrial salt imported from Australia was Rp 79/kg.&#13;
In its current state the small-scale salt industry in Indonesia is fundamentally&#13;
uncompetitive in world terms. Perhaps up to one-third of small farmers/sharefarmers would&#13;
not be able to compete in a more open and competitive salt industry. For example, some&#13;
farms are located as much as 5-10 km from a paved road resulting in very high transport&#13;
costs further reducing net returns. Others are in areas where the saltwater is of low salinity&#13;
thus reducing yields and net returns. Those farmers/sharefarmers more favorably located&#13;
could be competitive with improved technology and management. Compounding the&#13;
problem is an almost complete lack of institutional and technical support for salt&#13;
farmers/sharefarmers and very limited technological expertise in Indonesia on salt&#13;
production.&#13;
The quality of salt produced is low - typically 92-94 percent sodium chloride&#13;
compared with 99.7 percent from Australia and California and 96 percent from India. It has&#13;
high levels of soluble (principally calcium and magnesium salts) and insoluble (principally&#13;
organic matter and soil) impurities and moisture. The following table summarizes Indonesian&#13;
salt quality when compared to Australian and US salt.&#13;

Consequently, local salt must be washed to remove impurities and then dried to reduce the&#13;
moisture content to acceptable levels before it is iodized and packaged.&#13;
4. SALT PROCESSING&#13;
Like production, processing of salt is also concentrated in Java with only limited&#13;
capacity in other areas. In contrast to production, processing is carried out by a much smaller&#13;
number of operators - a total of approximately 300, of whom 11 (7 of which are in East&#13;
Java), account for approximately half the total capacity. lodization, to the degree it occurs, is&#13;
carried out by processors and with capacity concentrated much like overall processing&#13;
capacity. The distribution of processors and their capacity by province is shown in Table 1.&#13;
Government regulations mandate iodization of salt for human consumption. The&#13;
methods of washing salt and adding iodine vary from simple hand washing and mixing to use&#13;
of imported machinery which also washes and dries the salt. In general, the larger companies&#13;
utilize more mechanization.&#13;

5. MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION&#13;
Processors in most provinces purchase salt from one of the three large suppliers.&#13;
They then package the salt, possibly add iodine, and sell it on to retailers. The retail market&#13;
for salt is characterized by a large range in prices. At the bottom is low quality unprocessed&#13;
salt. At the other end is salt which has been processed and packaged, the costs of which lead&#13;
to a wide price margin. In essence, the price difference (ranging between 100 and 300 Rp per&#13;
kg) is driven by the availability of low quality raw salt and the cost of processing, iodizing&#13;
and packaging it. In one province where the local government has granted monopoly rights&#13;
for iodized salt to PT Garam, the price for iodized salt is even higher due to lack of&#13;
competition.&#13;
Illustrative information on marketing margins is available from case studies in&#13;
several provinces by the MOIT. In North Sulawesi, the local processor purchases salt from&#13;
PT Garam. The basic cost structure is as follows:&#13;

Page 7 of 11&#13;
In comparison to the ex-warehouse price for PT Garam salt in North Sulawesi of 160&#13;
Rp/kg, the price in West Java is 110 Rp/kg and in North Sumatra, 145 Rp/kg. This appears&#13;
to be largely a reflection of differences in transport costs although the more competitive&#13;
market in West Java together with the much larger volume sold would also be expected to&#13;
reduce the price.&#13;
It is clear that the salt industry is profitable, particularly for the processors who are&#13;
vertically integrated. Thus, the PT Garam cost of production is at least twice that of the&#13;
current farmgate price to smallholders. It then achieves a 60 percent margin on costs when&#13;
salt is sold in Madura for transport to other provinces. A further 10 percent is achieved in&#13;
Manado when the salt is sold to local processors. A further margin (approximately 30&#13;
percent) results when the salt is sold to retailers. Overall, in the provinces where it operates&#13;
PT Garam operates as a price leader which, through low technology production, inefficient&#13;
procedures and high margins leads to high prices to the consumer which, in turn, protect&#13;
other companies from downward pressure on prices and "guarantees" relatively high profits.&#13;
Tariffs and salt. This high cost structure operates behind some protection from&#13;
imports. Until early 1996 a 25 percent tariff was levied on salt imported for human&#13;
consumption. In the May 1996 deregulation package the rate was reduced to 20 percent and&#13;
is scheduled to fall to 10 percent by 2003. In contrast, there is no tariff protection for imports&#13;
of high quality industrial salt.&#13;
Nontariff barriers. There is also a range of nontariff barriers to internal trade. In&#13;
two provinces the governor has restricted trade through granting privileged access to the&#13;
province to PT Garam which then processes, iodizes and sells salt thorough local&#13;
subsidiaries. This approach is taken in the name of guaranteeing that all salt for human&#13;
consumption is iodized. And, indeed, in these two provinces the proportion of salt which is&#13;
adequately iodized is high. At the same time, in the absence of competition, the prices for&#13;
salt tend to be higher. There is also anecdotal evidence of market sharing between the&#13;
various companies in the larger population centers, such as Surabaya and Jakarta.&#13;
6. MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT&#13;
Responsibility for the salt industry as a whole rests with the MOIT which, in reality,&#13;
concentrates on processors and processing in its relations with the industry. It essentially has&#13;
no interaction with, and provides no support for, salt farmers/sharefarmers.&#13;
Monitoring the levels of iodine in salt is split between the MOIT and the MOH.&#13;
Neither ministry allocates adequate resources to this effort, the number of samples collected&#13;
and analyzed is too few, and the lack of links between the various data sets make it difficult&#13;
to identify the processor responsible for any sub-standard samples. There has been little&#13;
attempt at enforcement of regulations even when salt samples are shown to contain&#13;
inadequate levels of iodine.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 8 of 11&#13;
The current government approach to the industry is expressed through Kepres&#13;
69/1994 which emphasizes the processes which must be used to process salt. The approach&#13;
specified is capital intensive and would have the effect of giving advantage to the bigger&#13;
processors and PT Garam. Although the emphasis is on process, there are also specifications&#13;
for salt quality and iodization levels. The salt quality specifications are higher than are&#13;
currently produced by many processors, again giving advantage to the biggest processors and&#13;
the government owned company. This effect is compounded by the low quality of salt&#13;
produced by the farmers/sharefarmers. Meeting the requirements for processed salt under the&#13;
Kepres will require multiple washing of most of the salt produced.&#13;
Under these new regulations, the MOIT licenses processors on the recommendation&#13;
of the provincial office of the MOIT.&#13;
Legislation and regulations allowing for cancellation of licenses after 3 warning&#13;
letters are in place and MOIT has notified the industry of its intention to enforce these in&#13;
conjunction with the newly issued licenses.&#13;
7. THE INDUSTRY IN THE EARLY 1990's&#13;
In summary, the characteristics of the industry by the early 1990s were similar to&#13;
those for other highly regulated "essential" commodities in Indonesia, including fertilizer&#13;
and cement. These included (1) informal marketing arrangements; (2) protection from tariffs;&#13;
(3) a range of non-tariff steps and barriers restricting free entry and trade in the domestic&#13;
market; (4) technological stagnation in a technically inefficient industry; and (5) inability to&#13;
enforce government regulations relating to iodization. (However, unlike fertilizer and&#13;
cement, the government depends on salt as a component of an important public health&#13;
program).&#13;
There was also a floor price for "People's salt" (salt produced by small sharefarmers)&#13;
operated by PT Garam which was the dominant player in the industry and a resulting rapid&#13;
increase in the area of land devoted to People's salt; overproduction of low quality salt; and&#13;
large national stocks of salt held in conjunction with the price support scheme.&#13;
This salt industry structure was expensive, costs were passed on to the consumer&#13;
resulting in high prices, a technically inefficient industry produced low quality salt, and the&#13;
high degree of protection afforded by high tariff and non-tariff barriers insulated the industry&#13;
from pressures to innovate and keep costs down. The overall result was a low quality, high&#13;
cost product and inadequate levels of iodization and consumption of iodized salt, partly as a&#13;
result of the difference in price between raw salt and the processed, iodized and packaged&#13;
product.&#13;
8. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INDUSTRY&#13;
In response to increasing concern that the iodine status of the population may be&#13;
deteriorating and doubts about the effectiveness of control efforts, a number of initiatives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58                                  Annex 2&#13;
Page 9 of 11&#13;
were taken in the early 1990s to remedy the situation. There was renewed emphasis on&#13;
iodization of salt as the main strategy for control of IDD. In 1992 the floor price was&#13;
eliminated and no further additions were made to the national "buffer" stock of salt.&#13;
(Nevertheless, excess capacity remains and there is still a large national stock). In 1994 a&#13;
Presidential Decree (Kepres) 69/1994, and the associated ministerial decree, reaffirmed the&#13;
requirement for iodization of all salt for human consumption and specified the ways in which&#13;
this should be done. There are plans for PT Garam to purchase and wash approximately 300&#13;
000 tons of People's salt each year. To this end it will establish, in 1996, 4 washing plants, I&#13;
each in East Java, Central Java, West Java, and South Sulawesi. In contrast to the past, this&#13;
expansion will be in conjunction with a joint venture partner and will be only partly financed&#13;
by the MOF. Additional finance will be obtained from a commercial loan and from cash&#13;
flows.&#13;
Commencing in 1996, an international salt firm, in joint venture with a local&#13;
company, is importing approximately 30,000 tons per year of bulk salt for human&#13;
consumption. The salt is packaged in Jakarta. Other international firms, from inside and&#13;
outside ASEAN, are said to be interested in entering the market.&#13;
There is also an ongoing plan to build a new salt production and processing plant at&#13;
Kupang in NTT (where the dry season is somewhat longer) with an annual capacity of&#13;
650,000 tons industrial product and 100,000 tons high quality table salt. This proposed&#13;
investment does not seem to have progressed in the last year.&#13;
The crucial issue here is whether government will promote increased competition in&#13;
the industry and reduce its effective subsidy to PT Garam. There are signs that this may be&#13;
happening. Tariffs will be more than halved by 2003. PT Garam is now raising at least part&#13;
of the finance for expansion through a commercial loan. New players are entering the&#13;
industry and the government appears to be committed to enforcing the regulations regarding&#13;
iodization of salt.&#13;
9. ISSUES IN THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SALT INDUSTRY&#13;
The main issues facing the industry as it develops further are salt quality, the salt&#13;
farmers, iodization, and monitoring and enforcement.&#13;
Salt quality. The quality of salt produced in Indonesia is low, a reflection of the low&#13;
level of technology used by salt farmers/sharefarmers and PT Garam. Much of the people's&#13;
salt is often of such poor quality that it is not even suitable for iodization. The level of&#13;
soluble and insoluble impurities and moisture are all high. As a result the raw salt must be&#13;
washed and dried before it can be satisfactorily iodized and packaged. The lower the salt&#13;
quality the more processing is required and the greater the losses at this stage. Estimates of&#13;
losses in processing are as high as 30 percent.&#13;
Improving the quality of salt produced is an important aspect of sustainable&#13;
improvement in iodization and requires changing the production techniques used by salt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59                                   Annex 2&#13;
Page lOof ll&#13;
farmers/sharefarmers. Within the industry there is little expertise on improved methods of&#13;
salt production. As a result, improving the quality of salt produced will require international&#13;
expertise at least in the medium term, to introduce the changes required and a mechanism for&#13;
effective communication with farmers/sharefarmers.&#13;
Salt farmers/sharefarmers. (see also Annex 11). This group, to whom MOIT has&#13;
paid little attention and provided no extension support, poses several policy challenges. They&#13;
utilize very basic technology and yields are low. Many were drawn into the industry over the&#13;
period of the unrealistically high floor price scheme resulting in chronic surplus production.&#13;
The termination of the scheme in 1993, along with the large stockpile and continuing high&#13;
production, led to a rapid fall in the farmgate price for salt. As a result the welfare of&#13;
farmers/sharefarmers has fallen. Overall, there is a need to rationalize small-scale production&#13;
and this should concentrate on allowing the market to set the price of people's salt, and&#13;
improved quality and productivity. Achieving this end and at the same time improving the&#13;
possibilities for increasing iodization while providing support to a disadvantaged group of&#13;
people will involve:&#13;
- encouraging the development of technically and economically efficient small-&#13;
scale producers through technological improvements&#13;
* providing assistance to those who are likely to be unable to survive as salt&#13;
producers to diversify into other agricultural activities or into non-farm activities.&#13;
Even though farmers/sharefarmers are the key to improving quality, the MOIT has&#13;
paid little attention to this group in the past and has no capacity for reaching the&#13;
farmers/sharefarmers on a regular basis. New approaches, including use of the private sector,&#13;
will be needed to determine the most appropriate technology for small-scale salt production&#13;
and to promote its adoption by farmers/sharefarmers.&#13;
lodization. Regulations calling for iodization of salt have been on the books in&#13;
Indonesia for 20 years and the total capacity to iodize the salt is adequate. Yet, the&#13;
government's own salt company, PT Garam, iodizes only 10 percent of its own salt&#13;
production. lodization of most of the salt produced by PT Garam is carried out, with varying&#13;
degrees of success, by its subsidiaries and agents in the provinces. Further, monitoring the&#13;
iodine content of salt is inadequate and regulations mandating iodization of salt for human&#13;
consumption are seldom enforced. Although responsibility for monitoring and enforcement&#13;
rests with the both the MOIT and the MOH, the ability to enforce regulations via&#13;
cancellation of licenses lies with the MOIT. Resources for monitoring in both ministries have&#13;
been inadequate and has hindered identification of those processors who persistently fail to&#13;
produce adequately iodized salt.&#13;
Changes in the structure of the industry. Two recent developments, the&#13;
termination of the floor price and introduction of Kepres, are already leading to change in the&#13;
industry.&#13;
Termination of the floor price for salt has resulted in a sharp drop in the farmgate&#13;
price of salt from approximately 30 Rp/kg in 1993 to 15 Rp/kg in 1995. It is likely that prices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60                                    Annex 2&#13;
Page 11 of 11&#13;
will continue at this much lower level, partly because the earlier floor price was too high and&#13;
partly because the new entrants attracted by the high floor price resulted in excess capacity.&#13;
The falling returns to salt production will force change in the industry and provide an&#13;
important opportunity for assisting salt farmers/sharefarmers to improve their circumstances&#13;
through a range of strategies. For those able to survive in a more competitive environment&#13;
these include technological innovation, improved management of individual farms,&#13;
consolidation where feasible and, for some, complementary production of other commodities&#13;
such as fish and artemia'. Other farmers/sharefarmers are more likely to survive by moving&#13;
out of salt altogether and concentrating on alternate commodities of which fish and artemia&#13;
are the best prospects. The inability of government to provide institutional support for salt&#13;
farmers/sharefarmers to date and the limited technological expertise on small-scale salt&#13;
production will require approaches which are outside those available at the moment.&#13;
However, the lower prices will also serve as a stimulus for the those who remain in the&#13;
industry to increase productivity and, provided the information is available, to improve the&#13;
quality of their product.&#13;
The new regulations introduced under the Kepres will also lead to changes in the&#13;
structure of the industry, particularly in processing. Thus, many will not be able to meet the&#13;
new requirements and will not be licensed. Applications for licenses are currently being&#13;
considered by MOIT. Preliminary indications are that the number of processors will be&#13;
reduced from approximately 300 in 1995 to around 70 in 1997 with the smaller operators&#13;
dropping out. It is likely that the number will fall even further in the first 2-3 years of the&#13;
regulations as other smaller firms persistently fail to meet the standards for iodized salt. The&#13;
final number may be as low as 50. As a result, monitoring the iodine content of salt will be&#13;
easier and the proportion of salt that is adequately iodized will increase.&#13;
Even though the number of processors will fall competitive pressures in the industry&#13;
are likely to increase. Tariffs on salt for human consumption are scheduled to continue to fall&#13;
to 10 percent by 2003 opening the possibility of substantial volumes of imports for human&#13;
consumption. One international salt firm has established a joint venture with an Indonesian&#13;
partner and other firms are considering entering the market. The bigger local processors and&#13;
the international firms will move to improve returns on their investments by increasing&#13;
market share. And improved monitoring and enforcement will ensure a more level playing&#13;
field for all players.&#13;

Intensified Iodine Deficiency Control Project&#13;
PROJECT PROGRESS MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
Introduction&#13;
This Annex describes how project progress will be monitored and impact will be evaluated.&#13;
Reporting on monitoring and evaluation results will be done within the context of Bank progress&#13;
reporting. Project progress reporting will be on a semi-annual cycle. The half-yearly progress report&#13;
will cover the project status (physical progress, financial and performance status) and will include status&#13;
of the performance indicators. The program report will be prepared in advance of the half-yearly Bank&#13;
supervision missions. Details of progress reporting are described here.&#13;
Project Monitoring Indicators&#13;
Project status will be monitored through performance and output indicators (see attached table).&#13;
Project progress and performance will be monitored on the basis of several types of indicators:&#13;
(a) Progress Monitoring Against the Implementation Plan&#13;
At each supervision mission progress against the implementation plan will be reviewed, status&#13;
assessed, and the Plan updated to reflect progress. The updated version of the Implementation&#13;
Plan would indicate actual versus planned implementation and show adjustments made&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
(b) Quantitative Indicators&#13;
In each progress report and at each supervision, the indicators as listed in Table 1 of this Annex.&#13;
(c) Qualitative Indicators&#13;
At each supervision mission, an evaluation will be undertaken by the supervision team of&#13;
progress regarding qualitative indicators.. For each indicator, specific evidence of progress&#13;
should be provided.&#13;
Format of Progress Report&#13;
The half-yearly progress report should be organized in the following way and should include the&#13;
following sections:&#13;
(a)    A narrative section describing progress of each of the components: Issues that have&#13;
arisen, problems, delays, suggested changes, decisions made in the last year should be included for each&#13;
relevant component.&#13;
(b)    An update of the indicators: Actual status against planned implementation, quantitative&#13;
and qualitative indicators.&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 5&#13;
(c)    A section listing the recommendations and agreements made during the last Bank&#13;
supervision mission and actions or present position.&#13;
(d)    A list of all contract activities expected during the next year and half-year.&#13;
(e)    A set of tables covering the following:&#13;
*   Expenditures to date (SAR plan and current status) shown by category of expense and by&#13;
component;&#13;
*   Training activities (SAR plan and current status): number and type of training courses,&#13;
number of participants, duration of each course, cost of each course;&#13;
*   Status of Technical Assistance contracts (foreign and local): number of person/months&#13;
planned and currently used, costs of contracts and status of disbursement.&#13;
(f)    A report from the auditing consultants (whenever available).&#13;
Additional Reports and Reviews&#13;
A limited number of special reviews will also be carried out during project implementation, to&#13;
further support monitoring of progress. These reviews will be carried out by independent external&#13;
consultants and will be managed by the Project Secretariat.&#13;
Supervision Schedule&#13;
Supervision missions will be held twice a year, during the project implementation period. A&#13;
planned mission schedule is listed in Annex 6. The mid-term review mission will consist of a more&#13;
thorough review; this mission will review overall progress since the beginning of the implementation&#13;
period, and will evaluate the need for adjustments or restructuring of the project for the remainder of the&#13;
project period.&#13;

Intensified Iodine Deficiency Control Project&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
Project Implementation. The project will be implemented at both the national and&#13;
provincial levels as described below.&#13;
National level. Project activities will include formulation of policy for IDD control, revision&#13;
of regulations governing the salt industry, improved enforcement of iodization of salt, intersectoral&#13;
coordination, monitoring of the iodine status of the population and iodine content of salt, and&#13;
national level activities related to stimulation of demand for iodized salt.&#13;
Implementation of these national level activities will begin as soon as possible. The highest&#13;
priority will be given to immediately strengthening those activities which will bring about an&#13;
increase in the proportion of salt which is adequately iodized. This includes monitoring iodine levels&#13;
of salt at the factory level, provision of technical assistance to those factories found to have&#13;
inadequate iodization, creation of a combined database incorporating the results of the monitoring,&#13;
and termination of the license of those processors who persistently produce inadequately iodized&#13;
salt. In Year 1 these activities will concentrate on Java, the site of 85% of the total salt production&#13;
and iodization capacity. In the second year the emphasis will shift to the remaining sites of salt&#13;
production and processing whilst maintain close surveillance of the situation in Java.&#13;
Provincial level. At the provincial level the main strategy is to target activities. There is&#13;
considerable variation in iodine status between kabupaten and/or kecamatan. Consequently, the most&#13;
efficient approach, particularly for the expensive iodine capsules and more intensive IEC and&#13;
monitoring is to focus activity in those kecamatan in which iodine deficiency is most severe and the&#13;
degree of iodization of salt most inadequate. Three different packages of services will be targeted to&#13;
particular kecamatan depending on the severity of iodine deficiency and the adequacy of salt&#13;
iodization. The introduction of these packages will be phased in various parts of the country.&#13;
Phasing. The provincial level activities will be phased according to the availability of data,&#13;
the adequacy of iodine levels in salt and general feasibility considerations. This information on the&#13;
adequacy of iodine levels in salt is now available by kabupaten from SUSENAS. They indicate that,&#13;
in general, the levels are most inadequate on Java, then in the eastern provinces and most adequate in&#13;
Kalimantan and Sumatra. This overall phasing has been adopted for the introduction of provincial&#13;
activities. Thus, the initial emphasis for provincial activities will be on Java where older surveys&#13;
have indicated iodine deficiency is a problem and recent SUSENAS information indicates that levels&#13;
of adequacy of salt are also lowest. In addition, information on the iodine status of the population is&#13;
now, or soon will be, available at the kabupaten level for West and Central Java and Yogyakarta&#13;
from surveys being carried out under CHN3. The current project will fund a similar surveys in other&#13;
provinces in the first 2 years.&#13;
Attention will turn to the remaining provinces (Kalimantan and Sumatra where existing&#13;
information indicates that the adequacy of iodine levels in salt is highest) in the second year of the&#13;
project as surveys of the iodine status of the community are implemented thus allowing the&#13;
kecamatan level activities to be introduced in these provinces. In these provinces, broader activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

75                                     Annex 10&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
aimed at improving the level of iodization of salt and stimulating demand for iodized salt will have&#13;
commenced in Year 2.&#13;
Technical assistance. The project would support modest amounts cf international and local&#13;
technical assistance, concentrated in the first three years. International technical assistance,&#13;
estimated at 9 person years, would be directed at improving the quality of salt produced by salt&#13;
farmers/sharefarmers and at the quality of iodization, demand generation and operational research.&#13;
Local technical assistance of 30 person years would be used to assist with training modules, demand&#13;
generation and operational research.&#13;
Performance evaluation and supervision strategy. Monitoring of project implementation&#13;
will be the responsibility of the Project Secretariat in conjunction with the National and Provincial&#13;
Coordination Committees. The implementation progress of the project will be assessed through&#13;
monitoring activities and formative evaluation using the detailed performance indicators.&#13;
Additionally, outcome indicators have been identified to guide development impact evaluation.&#13;
Annual reviews will take place by October of each project year, starting in 1997, and will:&#13;
(a) analyze the previous year's performance and budget execution against project objectives and&#13;
indicators; (b) analyze the proposed workplan and budget for the following year; (c) discuss&#13;
adjustments to be made in the project implementation schedule; and (d) analyze the results of the&#13;
project evaluation. The proposed workplan and budget for the following year will have been&#13;
previously defined at the central and provincial levels and contain a detailed description of targets&#13;
and planned activities (see Annex 5).&#13;
A comprehensive mid-term review will be conducted to assess project performance and&#13;
initial impact in light of project objectives, project indicators and government policies.&#13;
A project implementation completion report is due no later than six months after the closing&#13;
date of the loan. The report is expected to provide a critical overview of project inputs, processes and&#13;
outcomes. The report will summarize: (a) project results and impact on the basis of indicators; (b)&#13;
key project activities and management; (c) lessons learned from project implementation; (d) the&#13;
project's financial status; and (e) implementation issues and recommendations.&#13;

Intensified Iodine Deficiency Control Project&#13;
STUDY OF SALT FARMERS AND SHAREFARMERS&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
This document is a preliminary report on a study of salt farmers and sharefarmers in&#13;
Indonesia undertaken in April and May of 1996. Its findings rely heavily on a survey of farmers&#13;
undertaken in three districts of Madura.&#13;
About 900,000 tonnes of (sometimes called "people's") salt are estimated to be produced&#13;
annually in Indonesia by small farmers (operating as landowners, leaseholders, sharecroppers and&#13;
laborers), mainly in the provinces of East Java (of which Madura island is a part, and which accounts&#13;
for about 45% of total production), West Java, Central Java, South Sulawesi and the NTB provinces.&#13;
Production technology is very basic and salt yields are low by international standards (e.g. compared&#13;
to the USA, Australia, India and Brazil), output quality is poor, and farmgate prices and financial&#13;
returns to salt enterprises are depressed since the ending (in 1993) of a national stock management&#13;
scheme which sought to maintain floor producer prices.&#13;
Because of the environmental (i.e. low salinity water) and climatic (i.e. short dry season)&#13;
conditions in which this salt is produced (and because of the prevailing - i.e. individual small farm,&#13;
low input/low output - mode of production which has developed in these circumstances) the&#13;
Indonesian small-scale salt industry is fundamentally uncompetitive in world terms.&#13;
The small farmers' salt is of very poor quality (about 94% NaCl on average), being&#13;
contaminated with insoluble materials (mud, sticks, stones from hand harvesting of thin salt crops)&#13;
and with calcium and magnesium compounds because of the salt evaporation techniques used. A&#13;
local state company (PT Garam) also produces salt on a larger scale, but uses essentially the same&#13;
technology as the farmers; there is no other institution in Indonesia responsible for technological&#13;
innovation or support to the small farmers.&#13;
Salt produced in this way is of concern to policy makers in Indonesia because the quantities&#13;
produced on individual farms to not lend themselves to easy iodization, because amounts of the salt&#13;
produced this way appear to enter local markets without being iodized (even if they go via&#13;
traders/processors), and because the situation of these farmers is deteriorating as prices continue to&#13;
fall and other sources of income-earning opportunities are presently limited. Increasing international&#13;
pressure on domestic producers as a result of Indonesia's membership of world and regional trade&#13;
bodies and the need to raise farmers' incomes in the absence of support buying (together with a&#13;
desire to raise output quality) have, therefore, suggested that the industry needs restructuring, with&#13;
farmers becoming more technically efficient at salt production (where this is possible) and/or more&#13;
diversified in their range of activities (i.e. in those circumstances where salt cannot be produced&#13;
more efficiently).&#13;
The survey of farmers in Madura suggests that the average salt farm size is about 2 hectares,&#13;
(although most farms are smaller than this - a more typical size would be 1.3 ha) and that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78                                   Annex 11&#13;

landowners' salt operations are larger than non-owners. The sample included severa! large&#13;
producers, with areas of salt of 0-30 hectares each.&#13;
Farms can be several kilometers away from both roads and source of salt water, and have&#13;
much lower ratios than is usual around the world of 'concentrator' (i.e. evaporation) ponds to&#13;
crystallizer ponds. Farmers are typically in their forties, have 20 years of salt experience, several&#13;
years primary education and no secondary education.&#13;
Farmers have almost no technical support, and access to credit is almost entirely from&#13;
informal sources, including advances from salt traders. Salt cultivation relies heavily on seasonal&#13;
labour, with about 5 laboring jobs being created per farm.&#13;
Average yields are low, at under 60 tonnes per hectare per (five month) season. The&#13;
estimated 1995 average farmgate (really pondside) price was Rp.1 5-37 per kg (compared to Rp25-35&#13;
three years ago). This is consistent with estimates made when the abandonment of the buffer stock&#13;
scheme was being mooted.&#13;
On-farm transportation costs (i.e. from pondside to road, and borne by the farmer after sale is&#13;
agreed) can be considerable, and these reduce farmers' earnings.&#13;
One-eighth of sampled farmers made no sales in 1995, but preferred to stockpile.&#13;
Estimated operating profits of salt enterprises are about Rp237,000 per hectare per season if&#13;
all output is sold; this figure is substantially reduced by any on-farm transportation, by stockpiling&#13;
over seasons, and for sharecroppers (who receive about 40% of this on average). About two-thirds&#13;
of farmers' incomes comes from salt production, although about half of farmers appear to have other&#13;
sources of income (fish farming and capture being most common).&#13;
The rainfall situation in the wet season (with respect to the respective amounts of&#13;
precipitation and evaporation) is not clear in Madura, but farmers do not store concentrating brine&#13;
across seasons, but start each year with fresh seawater. Further, intake seawater is often of low&#13;
salinity (1 or 2 Degrees Baume only - having been mixed with fresh water from rivers). In these&#13;
circumstances, water management is poor, with undersaturated brines (from an incorrect ratio of&#13;
concentrator to crystallizer ponds) being fed to cystallizers (resulting in calcium deposition) and no&#13;
draining of bittem after salt cystallization (resulting in magnesium deposition). A series of thin salt&#13;
crops are harvested throughout the season, contaminated with insoluble matter.&#13;
Individual, small-scale, scattered patterns of cultivation result in high transport costs&#13;
(because produced salt from ponds is not usually located at roadsides), the intake of low salinity&#13;
water for many farmers (because many farms are a long distance from the most saline water), and a&#13;
lack of realization of scale economies (e.g. through the use of machinery) in salt washing, grading,&#13;
packaging, and iodization.&#13;
Various options to improve the quantity and quality of salt from small-scale producers are&#13;
suggested. These primarily involve changing pond ratios to produce a thicker crop of salt in layers,&#13;
allowing year-round storage of water so as to start the season with more concentrated brine (and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

allow movement of saline water between farms), and consolidating farmers' ponds to enjoy design&#13;
and scale advantages.&#13;
Largely because of the historical institutional neglect of the industry, the technical and&#13;
financial viability of these models is not certain, and therefore, their potential applicability to all salt&#13;
farmers is impossible to predict at present. Options for consolidation are likely to be limited and&#13;
long-term in nature.&#13;
The best opportunities for most farmers to diversify their activities away from salt lie in the&#13;
cultivation of milkfish and in the production of artemia. Models to establish these as enterprises in&#13;
their own right and also integrated with salt cultivation (e.g. by using ponds for both fish and salt)&#13;
need to be tested, in association with work already being done by some institutions under the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture in Indonesia.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Intensified Iodine
            Deficiency Control Project is to lower the prevalence of
            iodine deficiency in Indonesia. This will be achieved
            through the following components: a) monitoring the iodine
            status of the community; b) increasing consumption of
            iodized salt; c) increasing the supply of iodized salt; d)
            targeted distribution of iodine capsules; and e)
            inter-ministerial policy and program coordination for
            control of iodine deficiency.
