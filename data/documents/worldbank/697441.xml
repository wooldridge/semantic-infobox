ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA&#13;
CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRIVATE&#13;
SECTOR&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:           Islamic Republic of Mauritania&#13;
Beneficiaries:       The Central Bank, Ministries of Planning and others&#13;
Credit Amount:       SDR 4.7 million (about US$7.2 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:               Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Project Objectives    The objectives of the Project are to: (i) encourage investor interest in&#13;
and Description:     pursuing opportunities in the private sector, especially in the mining&#13;
and fishing subsectors, via revision of the commercial and tax codes as&#13;
well as other activities designed to enhance entrepreneurial dynamism&#13;
and efficiency and (ii) strengthen the financial sector, so that it can&#13;
better provide credit and banking services needed by the private sector.&#13;
The Project will finance activities which will contribute to the&#13;
realization of the Government of Mauritania's Private Sector&#13;
Development program. That program is supported by the Private&#13;
Sector Development Credit (PSDC), which is being presetited to the&#13;
Board at the same time as this operation.&#13;
The proposed project will finance the following three subcomponents:&#13;
(i) upgrading of credit risk and borrower arrears information&#13;
(US$0.1 million); (ii) training in banking (US$0.9 million); and (iii)&#13;
study for the formulation of a strategy for the second phase of&#13;
financial sector development (US$0.1 million).&#13;
With respect to the private sector institutional and regulatory&#13;
framework, the proposed project will finance the following four&#13;
important subcomponents: (i) upgrading of the accounting and&#13;
auditing framework (US$0.4 million); (ii) support to the Chamber&#13;
of Commerce (US$0.4 million); (iii) strengthening of legal and&#13;
judiciary framework (US$2.6 million); and (iv) feasibility study of a&#13;
tax free regime for exporters (US$0. 1).&#13;
In the fishing and mining sectors, the following components will be&#13;
financed by the proposed project: (i) strengthening of the regulatory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
and institutional framework of the mining sector (US$ 1.1 million);&#13;
and (ii) survey of fishing resources, establishment of a monitoring&#13;
mechanism for fish exports and strengthening of environmental&#13;
and quality control capabilities (US$0.50 million).&#13;
Project              The executing agencies in charge of the components will be as&#13;
Implementation:      follows: (i) upgrading credit risk information, bank training and&#13;
development of a long-term financing strategy to benefit small- and&#13;
medium-size enterprises will be implemented by a small Implementation&#13;
Unit at the Central Bank; (ii) development of the accounting and&#13;
auditing framework will be carried by the Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU -- see below), which will work closely with the Ministry of&#13;
Finance and the existing Ordre des experts comptables; (iii)&#13;
reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce to aid in the promotion of&#13;
the private sector, as well as to provide support services to that sector,&#13;
will the Ministry of Commerce until such time as the Chamber of&#13;
Commerce is fully functional; (iv) legal and judiciary reform will be&#13;
carried out by the Directorate for Judiciary Affairs of the Ministry of&#13;
Justice for the training prograrn, the PCU (see below) under the&#13;
command of the Prime Minister's Office for the revision of legal texts&#13;
and the establishment of the commercial register, and the Secretariat&#13;
GMngral du Gouvernement at the Prime Minister's office for the&#13;
electronic indexation of laws and the publication of the improved&#13;
Official Bulletin; (v) study for the possible setting up of points francs as&#13;
a mechanism for export promotion will be executed by the Directorate&#13;
of Industry at the Ministry of Industry and Mining; (vi) promotion of&#13;
private investor interest in the mining sector will be implemented by the&#13;
Directorate of Mining at the Ministry of Industry and Mining; and (vii)&#13;
survey of fishing production and foreign exchange flows, the&#13;
implementation of the action plan it will produce to set up a mechanism&#13;
to monitor said flows, and the administration of technical support to the&#13;
CNROP (Conseil National de Recherches Oceanographiques et de&#13;
Peche) will be carried out by the Technical Advisor specifically given&#13;
that responsibility at the Ministry of Fishing.&#13;
An existing and experienced unit, the Cellule de rehabilitation du&#13;
secteur parapublic in the Ministry of Planning, will be responsible for&#13;
coordination of project implementation.&#13;
Project Benefits     The key focus of the proposed project is making the regulatory and&#13;
and Risks:           institutional framework for private sector development conducive to&#13;
attracting private investment. As such, the implementation of the&#13;
proposed-project is closely tied to the reforms envisaged under the&#13;
PSDC. In the process, the proposed project aims at promoting the&#13;
following: (i) better quality banking services and a better financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
sector framework through programs to upgrade the skills of bank&#13;
supervisors and commercial bank personnel, accountants, auditors,&#13;
magistrates and other legal personnel; (ii) improved access to detailed&#13;
informnation on the credit standing of borrowers and on arrears through&#13;
revamping the Centrale des Risques and the Centrale des Impayes; (iii)&#13;
an enhanced legal and accounting framework which will allow for&#13;
more transparent procedures and foster accountability and financial&#13;
discipline in the financial and private sectors; and (iv) an ongoing&#13;
dialogue between the private sector and the Government of Mauritania&#13;
(GOM), as well as a solid mechanism for extending support services to&#13;
aid the development of the private sector.&#13;
The success of the proposed project is not completely assured. The&#13;
vested interests within Mauritania may resist or try to dilute the positive&#13;
effect of the reform measures, especially those providing support for&#13;
the programs geared to upgrading and enforcing regulation of the&#13;
fishing sector. However, the GOM has given every indication that it&#13;
has a sense of participation and ownership in the proposed project and&#13;
that, in the interests of promoting the private sector, it is committed to&#13;
seeing it carried out successfully.&#13;
Environmental        No environmental risks are foreseen. Given the concem about the&#13;
Risks                depletion of the country's fish resources, the proposed project's survey&#13;
of fish resources component will help to provide baseline data that will&#13;
help future conservation efforts. Environmental safeguards are built&#13;
into various components of the proposed project, notably those dealing&#13;
with the revision of legal texts and codes.&#13;

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA&#13;
CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
I. BACKGROLTND&#13;
A. MACRO-ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
1.01. Economic Performance and Recent Economic Developments. For most of the 1970s&#13;
and until the mid-1980s, Mauritania's economic development has been uneven and marked by&#13;
major imbalances. While exogenous factors contributed significantly to the deterioration of the&#13;
country's economic and financial situation, their impact was aggravated by weak economic&#13;
management. During this period, the GOM embarked on a large public investment program&#13;
financed almost entirely through external borrowing. The program channeled resources toward&#13;
low-yielding projects which led to a large external debt and heavy debt service burden.&#13;
Domestic demand was sustained by excessive growth of public expenditures, which in turn&#13;
contributed to large balance of payments deficits. Price distortions and the regulated market for&#13;
agricultural and industrial products discouraged the development of private activities. Poorly&#13;
managed, over-equipped and over-staffed public enterprises became increasingly inefficient and&#13;
accumulated heavy financial losses.&#13;
1.02. From 1986 to 1991, the GOM carried out a number of important structural reforms. In&#13;
particular, the GOM pursued a far-reaching price and trade liberalization policy. Import licenses&#13;
were abolished and petroleum product marketing and urban transportation were deregulated.&#13;
Seven nonviable public enterprises were closed, others were reorganized, and the monopoly on&#13;
the sale of various basic items (including rice, tea and sugar) granted to import-export agency&#13;
(SONIMEX) was eliminated. The GOM also privatized all rice mills as well as the marketing of&#13;
grain products. The private sector rapidly replaced the public sector in land development,&#13;
agricultural production and marketing activities. In 1990, 1991 and part of 1992, however, the&#13;
economy experienced a series of exogenous shocks which had an adverse impact on the&#13;
economic and financial situation. Against this background, the GOM resumed negotiations with&#13;
the IMF and the World Bank which made it possible for an agreement to be reached on a Fourth&#13;
PFP (Policy Framework Paper) in late 1992.&#13;
1.03. Recent Developments. Since October 1992, most of the regulations restricting&#13;
competition in the financial sector have been abolished and the GOM has implemented all of the&#13;
monetary, credit, pricing, banking, trade, interest rate and exchange rate measures agreed under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
the Fourth Year Policy Framework Paper (PFP) to achieve long-term macro-economic stability.&#13;
In October 1992, the GOM devalued the ouguiya by 27 percent against the US dollar, thus&#13;
largely restoring external competitiveness. Since then, the relative stability of domestic prices&#13;
has allowed gains in competitiveness to be maintained. This was accompanied by far-reaching&#13;
reforms which substantially improved the climate for private sector activities. Measures&#13;
liberalizing the exchange system were implemented and restrictive features (export&#13;
authorizations, preferential exchange rate for workers' compensation, restrictions on&#13;
transactions in the free market for foreign bank notes and travelers' checks) were eliminated. A&#13;
system of auctions for import authorizations was introduced in January 1993 and was extended&#13;
to all imports except petroleum and those by the fisheries sector (both still allocated by the&#13;
Central Bank at that point) and SNUM (Socite Nationale Industrielle et Miniere, which, under&#13;
a separate convention, disposes freely of the free exchange earned on its exports). In addition,&#13;
most macro-economic targets have been met: consumer prices have stabilized and the goal of&#13;
limiting inflation in 1993 to less than 13 percent was achieved (inflation in 1993 in fact stood at&#13;
10 percent despite the devaluation which occurred in October 1992, while in the 1994 inflation&#13;
stood at 3.8 percent). GDP grew by 1.7 percent in 1992 and 4.5 percent in 1993-1994.&#13;
Nevertheless, external imbalances have widened due to the significantly lower prices of&#13;
Mauritania's two major exports, iron ore and fisheries products, in intemational markets, as well&#13;
as a higher debt service on external debt resulting from rising interest rates.&#13;
1.04. In October 1994, the GOM negotiated the Sixth Year PFP covering the period 1994-97.&#13;
The main medium-term objectives of the PFP are the attainment by 1996 of sustainable GDP&#13;
growth (4.4 percent), the containment of inflation (at about 3 percent a year), and the narrowing&#13;
of the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) from 13.8 percent of GDP in 1994 to&#13;
6.4 percent of GDP by 1997. To achieve these objectives, the GOM adopted a strategy aimed&#13;
at: (a) strengthening extemal competitiveness and reducing domestic absorption; (b)&#13;
consolidating structural reform by encouraging private sector initiatives through the provision of&#13;
adequate price incentives, reliance on market forces, and the liberalization of the legislative and&#13;
regulatory framework; and (c) seeking extemal debt relief and reforming the domestic banking&#13;
sector. Notwithstanding significant growth potential given the importance and diversity of&#13;
Mauritania's fishing grounds and newly discovered iron ore deposits, the medium-term&#13;
development outlook remains fragile.&#13;
B. THE PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
1.05. Public/private sector interface. A major drain on the economy has been poor&#13;
performance of the public sector, which in 1989 included 80 public enterprises, 22 of which&#13;
were of non-commercial nature. The remaining public enterprises -- 40 of which were majority&#13;
owned by the GOM -- were involved in economic sectors and accounted for more than half of&#13;
public investment, receiving almost one-fifth of the credit disbursed through the domestic&#13;
banking sector. In 1989, twelve enterprises dominated the public enterprise (PE) sector,&#13;
accounting for over 95 percent of sales and about 75 percent of employment. Overall&#13;
performance, reflecting largely the performance of these twelve enterprises, was mostly poor,&#13;
with high losses, mounting arrears, a rising debt burden, increasing illiquidity and reliance on&#13;
monopoly privileges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
1.06. Given the continued financial disequilibria in the PE sector, the GOM formulated in&#13;
1989 a Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Program (PESAP) and implemented an ambitious&#13;
rationalization plan, which as of today has resulted in: (a) the liquidation of fifteen PEs,&#13;
including one large manufacturing firm; (b) the privatization, or initiation of the process for the&#13;
privatization, of 15 PEs, including the large stevedoring activity at the Port of Nouakchott; (c)&#13;
the elimination of the state monopoly in the insurance sector and for the import of sugar, tea and&#13;
rice; and (d) the settling of all major government debt and arrears to PEs, as well as honoring&#13;
the GOM's obligation to pay its share capital due to key enterprises. Emphasis was placed on&#13;
maximizing the autonomy and enhanced efficiency of those enterprises which remained public,&#13;
while resources were shifted away from the public sector as a whole, leaving the private sector&#13;
as the most promising vehicle for promoting growth and employment creation.&#13;
1.07. Despite limited opportunities for private sector growth and the strong role played by the&#13;
public sector through the 1970s and early 1 980s, the Mauritanian private sector has always been&#13;
dynamic. This stems in part from the commercial traditions prevalent in Mauritania's trade-&#13;
oriented society, and from Mauritanians' active involvement in international trade in the West&#13;
Afiican region. It is estimated that the private sector accounts for about 75 percent of total&#13;
officially registered employment. Both the formal and informal private sectors are active in rural&#13;
as well as urban areas.&#13;
1.08. The formal private sector is dominated by a few large enterprises involved in trade,&#13;
fisheries, agriculture and some manufacturing. The owners of these businesses are typically&#13;
from prominent families, with substantial assets in Mauritania and overseas. Consequently, they&#13;
have little difficulty in obtaining financing for their operations, both from Mauritanian banks,&#13;
which in many instances are at least partly owned by them or their families, and from foreign&#13;
banks, which are happy to lend to them using their overseas-based assets as collateral.&#13;
1.09. At the other end of the spectrum, there is a large informal sector, consisting primarily of&#13;
individually or family-owned enterprises. The informal sector is estimated to employ, at a&#13;
minimum, about one third of the economically active labor force. It is likely to remain the main&#13;
outlet for entrants to the labor market. About 85 percent of small businesses are oriented&#13;
toward petty commerce (selling food and clothing) and services (laundry and hairdressing).&#13;
Only 10 percent are in construction, and about 4 percent engage in light manufacturing. The&#13;
fastest growing area of employment is services and commerce, with growth rates in excess of 15&#13;
percent in recent years.&#13;
1.10. Small operators in the informal sector typically have very limited access to bank credit,&#13;
because they have a limited range of assets, cannot provide accurate financial information&#13;
regarding their operations, or are intimidated by formal financial institutions. Women are quite&#13;
active as owners of private businesses (often no more than a stall in the marketplace), but&#13;
evidence suggests that women's access to credit is typically through their husbands. Informal&#13;
operators are believed to rely on informal credit circuits. These usually involve closed groups&#13;
(the family, the guild or the clan) which are able to minimize the cost of obtaining information&#13;
about the borrower, but which are also believed to charge extremely high interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1.11. Policy Framework The GOM's strategy for promoting growth of private sector&#13;
activities has pursued the following priorities: (i) a transparent and legally secure framework for&#13;
transactions; (ii) non-intrusive, efficient and respected public administration; (iii) competitive&#13;
markets that promote factor and product mobility; and (iv) efficient and responsive social,&#13;
physical and technological infrastructure. Priorities (i) and (iii) were pursued under the first&#13;
stage of liberalization measures; (ii) is the main focus of this project and other donor-assisted&#13;
programs; while (iv) is now a key element in the GOM's evaluation of its PIP in concert with the&#13;
donor community.&#13;
1.12. Compared to the pre-adjustment period, the economy is now less regulated and more&#13;
market-oriented. All quantitative import restrictions and price controls have been removed, and&#13;
prices are now allowed to move freely with supply and demand. Import tariffs have been&#13;
lowered and rationalized; corporate and personal income tax systems have been simplified and&#13;
rates reduced. The GOM has reduced its role in employment and wage setting, and has taken&#13;
the first steps toward modernizing the investment code. Its presence in agriculture has been&#13;
decreased by privatizing the marketing of coarse grains and reducing the roles of the&#13;
government owned SONADER (Socite Nationale pour le Developpement Rural) and CSA&#13;
(Commissariat a la Securite Alimentaire) enjoying a monopoly in this area. Through the&#13;
privatization program and other measures, the GOM has sought to promote the efficiency of the&#13;
parapublic sector.&#13;
1.13. Apart from macro-economic stability, the major focus of reforms undertaken in the&#13;
period 1992-1994 to stimulate private sector activities has been the incentive structure, notably&#13;
the trade and foreign exchange regime. To facilitate the transition to a unified system, a number&#13;
of intermediate steps have been taken. The GOM has intensified its efforts to liberalize the&#13;
foreign exchange system since 1992, notably through the elimination of the export licensing&#13;
system and the preferential foreign exchange rate given to Mauritanians resident abroad. As of&#13;
February 1993, a bidding system for import licenses was introduced, limited at first to a small&#13;
portion of import activities financed by the Central Bank (viz. all activities except imports&#13;
covered by the foreign exchange to which SNIM has unrestricted access). As of March 1994,&#13;
commercial banks have been authorized to open foreign exchange accounts abroad, on which&#13;
they are able to draw to finance imports in their customers' behalf As of the same date,&#13;
exporters have had access to 5 percent of foreign export receipts for services and 10 percent for&#13;
goods. As of July 1994, the GOM expanded the bidding system to cover all Central Bank&#13;
financed import operations except fuel and fishing imports. This raised the percentage subject&#13;
to competitive bidding to 60 percent of the total. As of September 1994, the percentage of&#13;
foreign exchange export receipts which exporters could retain was doubled. As of December&#13;
1994, the GOM has authorized the creation of foreign exchange offices by non-banking&#13;
establishments. At the same time, operations which banks could carry out on the free market&#13;
were expanded to include import operations and current private transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.    Foreign Exchange System&#13;
1.14. Despite substantial and relatively rapid liberalization of foreign exchange operations, the&#13;
continued existence of some foreign exchange controls continued to distort the incentive&#13;
structure for potential exporters. The maintenance of an official (more favorable) exchange rate&#13;
applicable to certain transactions constitutes a hidden subsidy for these activities, at the expense&#13;
of potential private foreign exchange earners. This is evidenced by the existence of a gap&#13;
between the official and parallel market exchange rate. While the size of the foreign exchange&#13;
gap has shrunk considerably in the wake of the 27 percent devaluation of the ouguiya which&#13;
occurred in October 1992, the implicit distortion in the foreign exchange market has continued&#13;
to penalize foreign exchange earners. Under the reform program supported by the Private&#13;
Sector Development Credit (PSDC) which is being presented to the Board at the same time as&#13;
this project, the objective is to unify the exchange rate system by December 31, 1995.&#13;
2.    The Regulatory Framework for Private Sector Activities&#13;
1. 15. The importance of the regulatory framework to the development of private sector&#13;
activities has been observed in numerous studies. In Mauritania's case, weaknesses in the&#13;
regulatory framework were identified in a FIAS (Foreign Investment Advisory Service) study as&#13;
one of the most important constraints inhibiting investment.&#13;
1.16. The Regulations Applying to Investment. Despite the reform of the investment code&#13;
undertaken in 1989, private entrepreneurs agree that there are persistent problems which the&#13;
revised code has not adequately addressed. The current investment code appears to discourage&#13;
foreign competition against established local companies. Complex red tape and costly&#13;
procedures complicate entry of a new firm into the local market. Among the serious gaps in the&#13;
legislation are the absence of a bankruptcy law and the obscurity of legislation governing the&#13;
collection of collateral for bank loans (including a 1993 loan recovery law which is proving&#13;
difficult to enforce - see paragraph 1.20).&#13;
1.17. The Legal Framework of the Private Sector. The legal framework covering private&#13;
sector activities in Mauritania is at times ambiguous. Many laws are derived from old French&#13;
codes which have since been amended or, at times, exhaustively revised in France itself&#13;
Information about legal changes is transmnitted through the Journal Officiel (Official Bulletin),&#13;
which is published irregularly and is not complemented with law reports. This results in reduced&#13;
transparency and inconsistent treatment of business operators by the legal authorities. There is&#13;
a pressing need to classify existing laws and identify the laws applicable to specific business&#13;
areas. Equally needed is the regulation of legal arbitration, which is lacking at present but which&#13;
is imperative in view of the preference foreign businesses manifest for legal arbitration, given the&#13;
ambiguity of the legal framework and the inadequate implementation of the law. Under the&#13;
proposed project, legal texts pertaining to private sector activities will be revised in line with the&#13;
aforementioned considerations. The proposed project will also finance the upgrading and&#13;
regular publication of an up-to-date Journal Officiel and the electronic indexing of Mauritanian&#13;
laws. The PSDC has an explicit third tranche release condition which requires the revision of&#13;
legal texts to IDA's satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
1.18. Implementation of the Law. Another problem stems from the poor state of the judicial&#13;
system. The lack of institutional and human resources, the dual training of magistrates (a result&#13;
of the coexistence of both a modem system, based on French colonial law, and the traditional&#13;
legal system, based on Shari 'a or Koranic laws) make the recourse to the courts costly and&#13;
unreliable. Lengthy delays, uncertainty of enforcement and the proliferation of dubious "expert&#13;
witnesses" who are richly remunerated characterize the judicial infrastructure. This has tended&#13;
to diminish confidence in the legal system, even where businessmen agree that adequate&#13;
legislation has been adopted. The proposed project will finance the training of lawyers and&#13;
judges with a view to improving enforcement of the law. At the same time, in order to increase&#13;
the efficiency and transparency of the implementation of the law, the GOM intends to abolish&#13;
the existing system of judicial experts, at the latest by credit effectiveness. Such a step is long&#13;
overdue, since at present virtually anybody can pass for a legal expert, and the supposed legal&#13;
experts are responsible for numerous distortions in the judicial process.&#13;
3.    The Lack of Adequate Support Services for the Private Sector&#13;
1. 19. The lack of vehicles to provide support services needed by private operators, notably&#13;
small and medium entrepreneurs, has seriously hindered the scope of their activities.&#13;
Furthermore, there is no universally accepted representative structure that can represent the&#13;
views of the private sector to the authorities or to donors. The Chamber of Commerce (CCIA&#13;
or Chambre de Commerce, d'Industrie et d'Agriculture) is a logical conduit for support to the&#13;
sector and notably to small and medium enterprises, following the model applied successfully in&#13;
other French-speaking countries, but it will require institutional strengthening so as to become&#13;
credible with private operators. The CGEM (Confgderation Generale des Employeurs&#13;
MauriUaniens), while much better organized, is domninated by large-scale entrepreneurs and will&#13;
continue to be viewed as such by most small- and medium-scale ones, suggesting a limited&#13;
potential for acting as a truly representative agency. The proposed project will finance capacity&#13;
building for a reconstituted, autonomous Chamber of Commerce.&#13;
4.    Accounting and Auditing Framework.&#13;
1.20. The inadequacy of the accounting and auditing framework is another problem which has&#13;
increased the uncertainty in which private investors operate in Mauritania. Given the lax&#13;
standards defining the minimum requirements for qualifying as an accountant or an auditor, the&#13;
validity of accounts and audits is often dubious. Furthermore, the organization of the&#13;
accounting and auditing professions is less than optimal, resulting in a weak esprit de corps&#13;
which has discouraged the basic self regulation commonly practiced by both professions&#13;
elsewhere. The plan complable (accounting plan) is likewise antiquated, having been inherited&#13;
from the colonial times. Being based on a French code which has since been vastly upgraded in&#13;
France itself, it cannot be said to be in conformnity with intemational standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
C. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR&#13;
1.21. The Mauritanian financial sector consists of four commercial banks, an insurance&#13;
company (NASR), the social security system and a cooperative agricultural credit facility&#13;
(UNCACEM, or Union Nationale de Cooperatives Agricoles, de Credit et d 'Epargne&#13;
Mutuelle). At present, the only institutions which can be said to act as full financial&#13;
intermediaries, channeling resources among sectors, are the commercial banks. During the first&#13;
banking sector restructuring under the SAC framework which was carried out between 1988&#13;
and 1990, the number of banks operating in Mauritania was reduced from 7 to 5, with two,&#13;
SMB and BIMA, merging to form BNM (Banque Nationale Mauritanienne); BMDC and FND&#13;
merged to form UBD (Union de Banques de Developpement); and the remaining banks (BMCI,&#13;
Banque Mauritanienne pour le Commerce et l'Industrie; BAMIS, Banque al-Baraka&#13;
Mauritanienne Islamique; and BALM, Banque Libyenne Mauritanienne) were reorganized.&#13;
The portfolio of bad debts totaling UM 14 billion (US$112 million) for the entire banking&#13;
system was transferred (against government bonds) from the books of the commercial banks to&#13;
a special account at the Central Bank of Mauritania. Commercial banks were asked to recover&#13;
the bad loans on the GOM's behalf for an 8 percent collection fee. All commercial banks were&#13;
recapitalized and an attempt was made to clean up their loan portfolio. The operation was&#13;
among the components supported by a structural adjustment credit of US$42.4 million.&#13;
1.22. The first restructuring operation did not, however, bring an end to the problems of the&#13;
banking sector. The performance of the sector continued to be compromised by inadequate&#13;
management, improper application of credit procedures, generally weak bank supervision, an&#13;
inadequate legal and judicial framework which complicated loan collection, and government&#13;
intervention in the banking sector. (The GOM was a majority shareholder in the development&#13;
bank, and maintained a major stake in the commercial banking system.) By 1992, the situation&#13;
of the banks had deteriorated to such an extent that the authorities decided that a second, more&#13;
radical overhaul of the system was needed. IDA's assistance was solicited, but IDA made clear&#13;
that a prerequisite for any intervention on its part would be upfront action and the&#13;
demonstration of the political will to reform the sector. As a result, the GOM successfully&#13;
completed in February 1993 the total disengagement of the State from the banking sector&#13;
through the privatization of all commercial banks but one (see para. 1.24), as well as the closure&#13;
of UBD, the sole development bank in the country.&#13;
1.23. In order to demonstrate its will to take action in the banking sector, the GOM&#13;
proceeded, in consultation with IDA, to do the following: (i) the conduct of bank audits&#13;
according to terms of reference prepared by the Bank; (ii) the full provisioning of the banks' bad&#13;
loans and the obligatory recapitalization of all banks; (iii) the strengthening of the bank&#13;
regulatory framework and its enforcement through strong support from the IMF and assistance&#13;
from IDA through a grant from its Institutional Development Fund; (iv) the establishment of a&#13;
recovery program for bad loans transferred to the ARCB (Agence de Recouvrement des&#13;
Creances Bancaires); the target for 1994 (UM 600 million) agreed with IDA has been fully met.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
1.24. Detailed audits of the banks' financial situation as of June 30, 1993 (completed in&#13;
December 1993 following terms of reference prepared by IDA) indicated that the four&#13;
commercial banks had a total of UM 35,661 million (US $285 million) in assets, UM 17,997&#13;
million (US $144 million) in deposits, UM 31,338 million (US $251 million) in loans. Bad loans&#13;
on that date were estimated at UM 18,840 million (US $151 million, or 60.1 percent of total&#13;
loans). Subsequently, the capital of BAMIS was increased from UM 2 billion (US $16 million)&#13;
to UM 3 billion (UM $24 million); the capital of Chinguitty Bank (formerly BALM) was raised&#13;
by UM 1,480 million (US $12 million) and has been 66 percent paid in, with the remainder paid&#13;
in 1994; the capital of BNM was also increased from UM 500 million (US $4 million) to UM 1&#13;
billion (US $ 8 million) with the increment to be paid half in 1993 and the remainder in 1994.&#13;
At present BMCI, BNM and BAMIS are 100 percent privately owned; Chinguitty Bank is 49&#13;
percent owned by the Libyan Bank for Foreign Trade (itself 100 percent owned by the Libyan&#13;
Government), with the remaining shares in the hands of the GOM.&#13;
1.25. More recent audits of the four banks mentioned above have been completed for their&#13;
financial situation as of December 31, 1993. The results suggest that, following substantial&#13;
recapitalization by shareholders as well as the assumption by the State of certain losses due to&#13;
mandatory provisioning of bad loans, all banks met the capital adequacy ratio (8 percent of&#13;
assets) mandated by law. The recapitalization made by shareholders totaled UM 4.55 billion&#13;
(US$36.4 million) for all four commercial banks. The losses assumed by the State totaled UM&#13;
4.0 billion (US$32 million), of which UM 1.0 billion (US$8 million) represented payment of&#13;
guarantees on non-performing public sector (PE) loans, and UM 700 million (US$5.6 million)&#13;
the State's share in the recapitalization of Chinguitty Bank, the only bank in which the State&#13;
remains a partner. As a result of a portfolio transfer from BNM to the State (included in the&#13;
UM 4.0 billion cost mentioned above), the State inherited UM 2.3 billion (US$18.4 million) of&#13;
non-performing loans. These loans were transferred to the care of the Agence pour le&#13;
Recouvrement des Creances Bancaires (ARCB), in addition to non-performing UBD loans&#13;
which were also transferred to ARCB following the closure of UBD.&#13;
1.26. To summarize progress, the following has already been or is soon to be completed: (i)&#13;
links between the banks and loss-makers have already been severed, with the rehabilitation of&#13;
the banks' portfolios, the strict enforcement of prudential regulations (including provisioning&#13;
guidelines), and the imminent improvement of credit risk and arrears information systems; (ii)&#13;
banks, now fully privatized, have an incentive to recover the part of their portfolio consisting of&#13;
loans for which provisions have been made, and indeed are reported to be recovering at a rapid&#13;
rate, while the authorities have put in place a recovery plan aimed at collecting roughly 20&#13;
percent of the bad loans held by the ARCB; (iii) the possibility of further state intervention in&#13;
the banking sector has been excluded, as the authorities have privatized or liquidated state banks&#13;
(except for Chinguitty Bank) and furthermore have asserted, and reiterated in the latest PFP,&#13;
their intention not to divert funds to the banks; (iv) the bank supervision and regulatory&#13;
framework has been significantly strengthened, with support from the IMF and the Institutional&#13;
Development Fund (IDF); (v) increased competition among banks has been encouraged through&#13;
the progressive liberalization of interest rates and more liberal (though still prudent) entry and&#13;
exit rules specified in the Banking Law which will be submitted to the Assembly for approval in&#13;
June 1995; (vi) schemes to increase access to credit by small borrowers are being explored, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
the second phase of the strategy for the development of the financial sector (formulation of&#13;
which is financed by this project) will specifically aim at developing mutualist and other&#13;
semiformal schemes to achieve this objective; (vii) a far-reaching debt recovery law has been&#13;
promulgated and work on improving the overall legal and judiciary framework has been&#13;
initiated; and (viii) the first step toward the development of money markets has been taken&#13;
through the issue of T-bills and government intervention on the market to ensure sufficient&#13;
liquidity, with further steps anticipated under the second phase of sectoral development&#13;
discussed below; this will make it possible to switch from direct to indirect instruments of&#13;
monetary control. To streamline information on outstanding credits, this project will finance the&#13;
amelioration and updating of the Credit Risk and Arrears Information databases. The proposed&#13;
project will also finance training for bankers, so as to improve the quality of banking services&#13;
and upgrade credit decision procedures which led to the deterioration of banks' financial&#13;
situation in the past. Finally, the proposed project will also finance a study for the formulation&#13;
of a strategy for the second phase of financial sector development, with a view to addressing&#13;
key issues like the financing of investment and increasing small and medium enterprises' access&#13;
to credit.&#13;
D. FISHING AND MINING SECTORS&#13;
1.    Fishing Sector&#13;
1.27. Fisheries activity in Mauritania grew remarkably over 1984-86 when catches&#13;
increased from 286,000 mt to 591,000 mt -- a compound rate of about 44 percent per&#13;
annum. However, in 1987 the total catch began to decline, from an estimated 563,000 mt in&#13;
1987 to 446,000 mt in 1991. This was largely the result of overfishing causing a depletion&#13;
of fish stocks, which arose from inadequate control and surveillance. Even with this&#13;
decline, Mauritania's fishing activity is one of the largest in the sub-region. Until 1988, the&#13;
fisheries sector in Mauritania was a dominant source of foreign exchange and government&#13;
revenue. The sector generated about US$308 million (68 percent) of the country's total&#13;
foreign exchange in 1988, falling to about US$236 million (54 percent) in 1991. Thereafter,&#13;
the sector's share of foreign exchange earnings has stabilized at slightly over 50 percent.&#13;
The fisheries sector also makes a vital contribution to the budget, yielding about 20 percent&#13;
of total budget revenues.&#13;
1.28. The fishing sector is the focus of considerable private sector interest, attracting&#13;
sizable investments from Mauritanian and foreign private operators. The sector was&#13;
expected to be a major source of economic growth during the 1980s and 1990s; to offer the&#13;
greatest potential for increased employment and value-added; and to be a key generator of&#13;
foreign exchange earnings and budget revenue. Instead, the fisheries sector now finds itself&#13;
in a crisis, evidenced by sharply lower catch rates caused by heavy overfishing and other&#13;
problems. Its recent poor performance is therefore particularly worrisome, given the&#13;
implications for: lower economic growth; diminished foreign exchange earnings; lower&#13;
budget revenues with substantially increased outstanding (and probably uncollectible) debts&#13;
due to the banking sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
1.29. By the late 1980s, it was clear that the fishing sector was facing major problems. These&#13;
could be summarized as follows: insufficient resources for national research to determine extent&#13;
of overfishing, need for conservation measures, etc.; persistence of problems of transparency&#13;
and efficiency in the allocation of fishing licenses; an inadequate regulatory framework for&#13;
resource management, resulting in overfishing and dangerous depletion of precious fishing&#13;
resources in certain areas; and an inefficient institutional framework in which the GOM was&#13;
involved as a producer and a marketing agent for fishing products.&#13;
1.30. The CNROP (Centre National de Recherches Oceanographiques et de Pche) has been&#13;
the major research institution devoted to follow-up of fishing stocks, biological equilibrium in&#13;
fishing zones and the appropriate level of fishing that would ensure maximum exploitation&#13;
consistent with renewal. The CNROP suffered from inadequate resources, a limited ability to&#13;
disseminate information and limited impact of policy decisions concerning the sector.&#13;
1.31. The problems of transparency and efficiency in the allocation of fishing licenses were&#13;
related to the arbitrary manner in which said licenses have sometimes been granted, the relative&#13;
lack of information about what licenses were granted to whom, and the fact that licenses are&#13;
granted to individuals rather than to boats. This resulted in instances of considerable overfishing&#13;
by individual licensees, and occasionally inadequate standards of storage on some boats (among&#13;
them a few which would not pass inspection if the boats themselves were being licensed). The&#13;
latter led to a few instances of Mauritanian fishing stocks being denied entry into foreign ports,&#13;
with obvious negative implications for the country's reputation in this area. The allocation of&#13;
licenses has momentous implications for the development of artisanal fishing, which has to&#13;
compete with industrial fishing operators for the same grounds. As artisanal fishing is a&#13;
promising area for employment creation, fair access to fishing resources is a crucial&#13;
consideration.&#13;
1.32. The lack of an adequate regulatory and supervisory framework was a serious constraint,&#13;
as it led to numerous violations going unpunished. The lack of control contributed to&#13;
overfishing, ecologically dangerous practices, inadequate standards and huge capital flight&#13;
through unreported export operations. The latter not only harmed the Mauritanian economy,&#13;
but has also contributed to the ill-health of the financial sector, as certain borrowers in the&#13;
fishing industry defaulted on loans while channeling revenues elsewhere. The component of this&#13;
project dealing with fishing focuses on systematic monitoring of foreign exchange earnings from&#13;
fishing exports, with a view to providing the GOM with a proper apparatus for the surveillance&#13;
of export activities.&#13;
1.33. Finally, while private sector activities dominate the fishing sector, the GOM's&#13;
involvement in certain areas of production and in the marketing of fishing products has resulted&#13;
in instances of inefficiency, inadequate investment and decision-making determined by non-&#13;
market-based criteria. The GOM's involvement in production and marketing is through: (a) a&#13;
number ofjoint-venture companies; and (b) the Marketing Monopoly Board (Societe&#13;
Mauritanienne pour la Commercialisation de la Peche, or SMCP).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
1.34. The joint venture companies comprised three categories: public companies formed with&#13;
the participation of other States (the two largest being MAUSOV, with the Commonwealth of&#13;
Independent States acting as a successor for the former Soviet Union, and ALMAP, with&#13;
Algeria); companies owned by the Mauritanian State in association with private Mauritanian&#13;
entrepreneurs as well as foreign interests, and companies owned by Mauritanian citizens and&#13;
foreign interests. As a rule, most such companies have suffered substantial financial losses, the&#13;
biggest loss-makers being MAUSOV and ALMAP, owing to dubious onshore equipment, poor&#13;
utilization of vessels and high operating costs. Although the joint-venture companies have to be&#13;
51 percent Mauritanian-owned, foreign citizens control a large part of management and&#13;
technical activities. Furthermore, as the centrally planned economies to which Mauritania's&#13;
partners typically belonged moved to restructure their enterprises and rationalize use of&#13;
resources, Mauritania was forced to contemplate the prospect of assuming full responsibility for&#13;
these companies in the near-future, with little or not prospect of continued direct and indirect&#13;
state subsidies from the partners in question.&#13;
1.35. In addition, the GOM is involved in the marketing of fishing products through the&#13;
SMCP, set up in 1984 by decree and given the monopoly for marketing fish that boats were&#13;
obligated to land in Nouadhibou (some exemptions to this rule existed; they included the catch&#13;
of MAUSOV and ALMAP). The creation of SMCP was inspired by the need of the GOM to&#13;
control the payment of export taxes on fishes and the repatriation of foreign exchange earnings.&#13;
Over time, however, SMCP became overstaffed and inefficient and its financial transactions&#13;
devoid of any transparency. Moreover, in spite of its position, its net profits kept declining,&#13;
resulting in a loss in 1991. SMCP's operations led to a decrease in incentives to fishermen and&#13;
in a sharp reduction in the fishing fleet operating in the Mauritanian waters. This in tum led to&#13;
unpaid loans to the banking sector by the fishing industry.&#13;
1.36. Policy Reforms Carried Out. In the closing months of 1994, the GOM has carried out&#13;
the following: (i) adoption of an action plan in concert with the donor community stemming&#13;
from the policy parameters defined at the Nouadhibou meeting; (ii) presentation of a plan for the&#13;
divestiture of ALMAP and MAUSOV; (iii) reduction of the GOM's stake in SMCP to 35&#13;
percent; (iv) approval of a maritime code laying the foundations of a transparent and well-&#13;
defined regulatory framework; (v) adoption of an action plan for the strengthening of the&#13;
CNROP (with technical support from the donor community) and the setting in motion of its&#13;
application; (vi) creation of a Maritime Surveillance Authority with budgetary resources to&#13;
ensure surveillance, supported through donor capacity building programs; (vii) imposition and&#13;
enforcement of absolute compliance with fishing ground limits and restrictions on fishing&#13;
equipment and motors as recommended by the CNROP; (viii) permnanent closure of Zone A of&#13;
the Banc d'Arguin and the implementation of regulations for Zones B and C, the&#13;
aforementioned zones having been identified by the CNROP as having been dangerously&#13;
overfished; (ix) establishment of a committee to award licenses for pelagic fishing and access&#13;
rights for demersal and cephalopod fishing, according to clearly defined and transparent criteria;&#13;
and (x) strict application of the granting of fishing authorizations to boats.&#13;
1.37. The donor community, which has been actively involved in dialogue with the&#13;
Mauritanian authorities regarding the fishing community, has already offered substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
technical support to enable the authorities to carry out their ambitious program of reforms in the&#13;
sector. Such technical support includes: capacity building for the CNROP, support for&#13;
strengthening the surveillance of the sector, support for reorganizing the Ministry of Fishing,&#13;
and assistance in the implementation of several studies, including the study dealing with taxation&#13;
of the sector, and studies which have contributed to the revised text of the maritime codes and&#13;
other regulations related to fishing. As a result of the substantial and continuing donor support&#13;
already extended, notably by the European Union, France and Germany, the need for&#13;
supplemental capacity building under this proposed project is fairly limited. This explains the&#13;
relatively small size of capacity building directed to this important sector in the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
2.    Mining Sector&#13;
1.38. Another focus of private sector activity is mining. Mining represents an estimated 12&#13;
percent of Mauritania's GDP and 38 percent of its exports. A major part of the production is&#13;
represented by iron ore that, with billions of tons of mineral reserves, will remain a major force&#13;
in the next decades. The key actor in this area is SNIM, in which the GOM has a majority stake&#13;
but which is run autonomously. SNIM, which is based in Nouadhibou oversees the production&#13;
of iron ore at Zoueirate. SNIM's output of iron ore has increased from 8.3 million tons in 1992&#13;
to 11.4 million tons in 1994. SNIM has been beneficiary of substantial support from IDA,&#13;
notably in the context of the PESAP.&#13;
1.39.  Several mineral zones have been identified in Mauritania, notably for gold and copper.&#13;
In addition, potential investors have expressed interest in searching for gold and non-ferrous&#13;
metals. They have, however, been hindered by lack of geological data and incomplete mining&#13;
legislation that introduces uncertainty and negotiating delays. It is, in fact, extremely difficult to&#13;
speak of development of the mining sector in the near-complete absence of data, basic&#13;
geological maps, a transparent mining code or a tax structure that is competitive with other&#13;
countries in the region. Investor interest is stimulated by the fact that numerous finds have been&#13;
reported, and successfully exploited, in neighboring countries (notably Ghana and Mali).&#13;
1.40. Given the preponderance of iron ore and the need to concentrate on ensuring the smooth&#13;
functioning of SNIM as an autonomous company yielding the lion's share of the country's&#13;
export earnings, it is only recently that the GOM has directed its attention to the non-ferrous&#13;
mining sector. The authorities have adopted an action plan for the development of the sector, in&#13;
concertation with the Bank. The plan covers the identification of key areas for further dialogue,&#13;
the reorganization of the Direction des Mines et de la Geologie, the revision of the mining code&#13;
and the tax code for mining activities, and the training of government staff in order to enhance&#13;
regulatory capabilities and ensure greater sensitivity to the needs of private investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.01. The proposed project will assist the GOM in implementing a program of private sector&#13;
promotion through strengthening the legal and regulatory framework surrounding business&#13;
activities and creating an environment that encourages and facilitates initiative on the part of&#13;
private investors. In order to realize this goal of creating an enabling environment for private&#13;
enterprise, the proposed Capacity Building Project (CBP) for the Development of the Private&#13;
Sector will focus on financing activities which: (i) encourage investor interest in pursuing&#13;
opportunities in the private sector, especially in the mining and fishing subsectors, via revision of&#13;
the commercial and tax codes as well as other activities designed to enhance entrepreneurial&#13;
dynamism and efficiency and (ii) strengthen the financial sector, so that it can better provide&#13;
credit and banking services needed by the private sector. The components of the proposed&#13;
project are designed to facilitate the implementation of policy reforms under the GOM' s&#13;
program for the promotion of private sector development. That program is supported by the&#13;
PSDC, which is being presented to the Board at the same time as the proposed project. The&#13;
policy measures to be carried out under the GOM's program are spelled out in the Letters of&#13;
Development Policy (Annex 2) prepared in connection with the PSDC.&#13;
2.02. Specifically, the proposed project will address the following areas:&#13;
(a)   improving the quality and scope of information available to private&#13;
investors seeking to make investment decisions, through the upgrading of&#13;
credit risk information database (Component l.a. of the proposed project as&#13;
described in detail in Section B "Project Description"), amelioration of the&#13;
accounting and auditing framework (Component 2.a.), the commercial register&#13;
(Component 2.c.ii.), the upgrading and regular publication of the Journal&#13;
Officiel or Official Bulletin (Component 2.c.iv.), the electronic indexation of&#13;
Mauritanian laws (Component 2.c.v.), the improvement of cadastral procedures&#13;
(Component 3.a.ii.) the monitoring of resources and foreign exchange flows in&#13;
the fishing sector (Component 4.a.) and the dissemination of information about&#13;
the GOM's policy measures by the PCU (Project Coordination Unit -- see para.&#13;
2.50);&#13;
(b)   enhancing the capabilities of both regulators and operators providing&#13;
support services to the private sector in key areas so as to ensure better&#13;
enforcement of regulations and better quality of support services to the&#13;
private sector, through the training of bankers (Component 1 .b.i. and 1 .b.ii.),&#13;
accountants and auditors (Component 2.a.iv.), Chamber of Commerce staff&#13;
(Component 2.b.), magistrates and court auxiliaries (Component 2.c.ii.),&#13;
technicians for electronic indexation of Mauritanian laws (component 2.c.iii.),&#13;
and officials and technicians at the Direction des Mines et de la Geologie&#13;
(Component 3.a.iii.);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
(c)   strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for private and financial&#13;
sector operations through the revision of the accounting plan and standards for&#13;
the accounting profession (Component 2.a.ii. and 2.a.iii.), the revision of key&#13;
legal texts which affect private sector activities (Component 2.c.i.), the revision&#13;
of the mining code and tax legislation applied to mining (Component 3.a.i. and&#13;
3.a.ii.), and improved monitoring of fish exports and enhanced environmental&#13;
and quality control in the fishing sector (Component 4.a.); and&#13;
(d)   exploring additional mechanisms to strengthen and support the private&#13;
sector, through the elaboration of a strategy for a second phase of financial&#13;
sector development (Component l.c.), a feasibility study and scheme for a tax-&#13;
free regime for exporters (Component 2.d.), support to the Chamber of&#13;
Commerce (Component 2.b.), which will provide a forum for the private, notably&#13;
the informal, sector, and improved dialogue between the private sector and other&#13;
project beneficiaries through the PCU (see para. 2.50).&#13;
2.03. In preparing the proposed project, care was taken to involve, to the maximum extent&#13;
possible, representatives of the private and financial sector, as well as the staff of the various&#13;
concerned ministries. It was through dialogue with these interlocutors that the areas of&#13;
intervention, the scope of intervention, the budget for each component, the implementation&#13;
schedule, monitoring procedures, and the performance indicators were developed. This was&#13;
done to ensure a sense of project ownership as well as a realistic approach to implementation.&#13;
Agreement was reached with the GOM to continue client consultation throughout project&#13;
implementation, and to make extensive use of ZOPP (Zieleorientierte Projektplanung,&#13;
objectives-oriented project planning) to maximize the efficiency of this participatory effort. The&#13;
proposed project includes financing for two ZOPP workshops.&#13;
2.04. Lessons Learned. The lessons learned from previous capacity building operations&#13;
include the following:&#13;
(a)   It is essential to involve project beneficiaries in the design, preparation and&#13;
implementation of project components which involve them. The successful&#13;
PESAP operation in Mauritania (MAU-2167) was able to involve enterprises&#13;
receiving assistance in all stages of dialogue, which proved highly beneficial&#13;
during the implementation stage. This participatory approach has been used in&#13;
the preparation of this project, and will continue to be emphasized during project&#13;
implementation, through, inter alia, the use of ZOPP workshops.&#13;
(b)   A unit responsible for the coordination of project implementation is invaluable to&#13;
ensure project success. Virtually all technical assistance programs in Mauritania&#13;
other than PESAP have suffered from slow implementation and delayed&#13;
disbursements. Success was possible in the case of PESAP because of the role&#13;
played by the Cellule pour la rehabilitation du secteur parapublic, which&#13;
ensured interministerial coordination and handled disbursement and procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
procedures. The proposed project will involve said unit in the coordination of&#13;
project implementation, as the implementation of PESAP is now nearing its end.&#13;
This will make it possible to capitalize on its experience and on its record of&#13;
proven success.&#13;
(c)   Rehabilitation of commercial banks requires rigorous follow-up, the upgrading of&#13;
the skills of commercial bankers and a better flow of information among banks&#13;
and to the Central Bank. The first commercial bank restructuring, which was&#13;
supported by a SAC (MAU- 1812), did not prevent the banks from slipping back&#13;
into unsound financial practices and poor portfolio maintenance. Inadequate&#13;
bank supervision and imperfect data transmission allowed the problem to go&#13;
undetected for some time. This project emphasizes improved information flows&#13;
and involves the Central Bank, particularly the Bank Supervision Department, in&#13;
the implementation of several components.&#13;

(ii)    Reorganization of the Direction des Mines et de la Geologie (Mining and&#13;
Geology Directorate), and revision of cadastral procedures; and&#13;
(iii) Training of staff at the Direction des Mines et de la Geologie.&#13;
(4)   Fishing Sector (US$0.50 million)&#13;
4.a.: Survey of (fisheries) resources to assess the quantity and quality of resources in the&#13;
fishing sector, their current level of exploitation, and foreign exchange flows in&#13;
and out of the sector; establishment of a monitoring mechanism for said flows,&#13;
and capacity building in the environmental and quality control areas.&#13;
2.06. These components are described in greater detail in the following paragraphs. The steps&#13;
entailed in their implementation are summarized in Annex 1 (Implementation Schedule).&#13;
1.    Financial Sector&#13;
2.07. Upgrading of Credit Risk and Borrower Arrears Information Databases (Centrale&#13;
des Risques and Centrale des Impayes - Component l.a.). This component will finance the&#13;
strengthening of the centralized information database pertaining to credits outstanding and the&#13;
size of borrower arrears in the banking system. The centralized credit information database&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
(Centrale des Risques) is an important instrument to ensure that banks share information about&#13;
borrowers who have dealings with more than one bank. The system can be used to ensure that&#13;
bad borrowers do not have access to further credit, thereby reducing the perceived riskiness of&#13;
new borrowers. The system will make it possible for each bank to be informed whether the&#13;
prospective borrower is indebted to other banks, whether the borrower's assets have been used&#13;
as collateral for other loans, and whether the borrower has acted as guarantor for another&#13;
borrower. The second database whose upgrading will be financed under this component is the&#13;
centralized information database for arrears (Centrale des Impayes), which provides information&#13;
on the extent to which a borrower may be delinquent on a loan or undergoing legal prosecution&#13;
owing to nonpayment.&#13;
2.08. The Central Bank currently has a Centrale des Risques as well as a Centrale des&#13;
Impayes, but both are of very poor quality. This reflects limited equipment and software,&#13;
inadequate data processing methods, and staff at the Bank Supervision Department of the Bank&#13;
which has received little training in this area. The proposed project will finance: (i) the Central&#13;
Bank's purchase of additional equipment (two computers) needed to maintain the data; (ii)&#13;
short-term advisory services to update the information in both databases; (iii) the training of&#13;
Central Bank personnel working in the Bank Supervision Department to become better qualified&#13;
to monitor the process of data transmission and to maintain the databases; and (iv) the training&#13;
of commercial bank personnel to fill out the requisite forms accurately and provide the data on a&#13;
timely basis. Access to both databases will be ensured, so that any creditor considering making&#13;
a loan will have information on the financial condition of the potential borrower supplied by the&#13;
Centrale des Risques and the Centrale des Impayes. The Agence pour le Recouvremenl des&#13;
Creances Bancaires (ARCB) will also have complete access to these two databases. Two&#13;
short-terrn advisors will be recruited from abroad for the purposes of data management design&#13;
and training (Terms of reference for these consultants are in the Project implementation file).&#13;
This component of the proposed project will be implemented by the Central Bank, as shown in&#13;
Figure 1 of the Organization Chart (Annex 5). The component will be executed over a period&#13;
of six months.&#13;
2.09. Training in Banking (Component l.b.). The training of commercial bank personnel is&#13;
a crucial component of this proposed project, given the poor quality of bank management in the&#13;
past, and the evident lack of experience in bank accounting, provision of banking services, legal&#13;
procedures related to banking operations, information systems and internal auditing. A two-part&#13;
training program will offer: (a) professional training for bank employees and (b) a (diploma)&#13;
course for the specialized training of bank personnel. The program will be administered by the&#13;
Center for Bank Training (Centre de Formation Bancaire - CFB), an entity established by the&#13;
commercial banks under the guidance of the Central Bank.&#13;
2.10. The cost of the program will be partially recovered for the professional training (fees will&#13;
total 50 percent of actual costs) and fully recovered for the diploma course. The justification of&#13;
partial cost recovery in the case of professional training stems from the externalities involved.&#13;
There is an advantage in insisting on a minimum level of training offered to the staff of all banks,&#13;
according to a uniform methodology consistent with international standards. The commercial&#13;
banks will be required by the Cent'ral Bank, in its role as supervisory agency, to send selected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
staff to the professional training courses. This will ensure a homogeneity of basic methods and&#13;
standards across banks, regardless of other training programs each bank may adopt individually.&#13;
The emphasis on course-oriented training as opposed to on-the-job training reflects the fact that&#13;
on-the-job training is already a component of training programs applied by the banks themselves&#13;
internally, and that, by its very nature, on-the-job training is not easily adaptable to a uniform&#13;
format.&#13;
2.11. The courses for both professional and diploma training will be held in Mauritania and&#13;
will comprise: (i) six short-term (three-week) professional training courses over a period of a&#13;
year offered for bankers in the areas of resource mobilization, liability management, letters of&#13;
credit, foreign exchange operations, lending decisions and portfolio management; and (ii) a&#13;
three-year diploma program, offered in three six-month cycles. The professional training will be&#13;
received by 30 students (some attending more than one seminar). The diploma will aim to train&#13;
15-20 students per year.&#13;
2.12. This component will be implemented with the help of local and foreign short-term&#13;
consultants. The terms of reference for these short-term consultants are in the Project&#13;
implementation file. The component will finance the use of short-term consultancy services&#13;
(namely, the services of a consulting firmn) for: (i) the teaching of the professional training&#13;
courses; (ii) six interventions of six months each by foreign instructors in the diploma program&#13;
over a period of three years. The interventions of the foreign instructors will be timed as&#13;
follows: three the first year, two the second and one the third, the objective being the teaching&#13;
of courses and, simultaneously, the training of local trainers who will progressively take over&#13;
from the foreign instructors. The first year will be dedicated entirely to the training of local&#13;
trainers. The diploma training program is expected to be self-sustaining once the training of&#13;
local instructors is completed. The component will also finance the purchase of equipment for&#13;
instructional purposes (six computers with software) and the preparation of instruction&#13;
manuals and other pedagogical materials which can be used by the local instructors once they&#13;
are fully trained.&#13;
2.13. As shown in Figure 1 of the Organization Chart (Annex 5), the Central Bank will be&#13;
responsible for the implementation of this component, which will be cover a period of a year for&#13;
(a) and three years for (b). Assurances have been provided by the GOM that the implementing&#13;
agency will submit, by September 30, 1995 at the latest, a short-list of consulting firms to&#13;
execute this component, from which the selection will be made. This will ensure that the&#13;
training program will be clearly defined and ready for launching once candidates for the courses&#13;
have been identified.&#13;
2.14. Formulation of a Strategy for the Second Phase of the Development of the&#13;
Financial Sector (Component l.c.). Under this component, the proposed project will finance&#13;
(a) a study to prepare a strategy paper for the second phase of the development of the financial&#13;
sector, the first phase (restructuring of the banks) having been completed; and (b) short-term&#13;
advisory services for the production of promotional materials for new financial institutions or&#13;
instruments, should it be concluded in the course of discussions between the GOM and IDA that&#13;
such a step is warranted. The emphasis of this phase will be on widening access to credit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
(notably to small- and medium-size enterprises), and promoting the availability of medium- and&#13;
long-term financing. The underlying objective is to make the financial sector more responsive to&#13;
the needs of private sector operators, without jeopardizing the private and autonomous nature&#13;
of key credit institutions or compromising minimum performance standards established by the&#13;
prudential regulatory framework.&#13;
2.15. The study will focus on: (i) exploring the scope for new, privately-owned financial&#13;
institutions (GOM limited to minority participations only) to mobilize longer-term resources and&#13;
provide medium- and long-term financing; (ii) exploring the feasibility of setting up a Credit&#13;
Guarantee Fund, which has been employed successfully in more than a dozen countries&#13;
(including the Carneroon and Ghana in Africa), provided the fund was not financed by&#13;
budgetary resources or counterpart funds; (iii) developing mutualist (or cooperative)&#13;
mechanisms (which have proven successful in a broad range of countries, especially in Asia and&#13;
Latin America) for mobilizing savings from, and, subsequently, providing credit to, small- and&#13;
medium-size private enterprises; (iv) examining the role of the institutional investors (the&#13;
privatized insurance company and the social security system) and exploring means of&#13;
transforming them into dynamic participants in the financial system; and (v) coordinating&#13;
existing and new schemes so as to avoid excessive sectoral concentration and to ensure proper&#13;
supervision and regulation.&#13;
2.16. Assurances have been provided by the GOM that the conclusions of the study will form&#13;
the basis of a subsequent dialogue with IDA for the formulation of a detailed strategy, including&#13;
incentives and regulatory measures, for the second phase of the development of the sector, and&#13;
that recommendations will be implemented in light of the dialogue with IDA. To the extent that&#13;
said strategy calls for eliciting foreign investors' interest in new financial institutions or&#13;
instruments, this component will finance short-term advisory services for the preparation of&#13;
promotional material for that purpose. As shown in Figure I of the Organization Chart (Annex&#13;
5), the Central Bank will be responsible for the implementation of this component, which will&#13;
carried out over a period of eight months. The Terms of Reference for this study are in the&#13;
Project implementation file.&#13;
2.    Private Sector Institutional and Regulatory Framework&#13;
2.17. Upgrading of the Accounting and Auditing Framework (Component 2.a.). This&#13;
component will finance two studies and a training program designed to improve the quality and&#13;
effectiveness of monitoring of financial accounts and the reporting thereof across enterprises.&#13;
The first study which will examine and comparatively evaluate ways to reorganize the&#13;
profession and enhance its standing. The study will also make recommendations for capacity&#13;
building in both professions, and will recommend the necessary modification of rules and&#13;
standards for the practice of accounting and auditing so as to define stringent minimum&#13;
qualifications for practicing as a professional accountant or auditor, in contrast to the current&#13;
situation where unqualified people can offer their services as "experts". The second study&#13;
financed by this component will focus on revising the Plan Comptable (accounting plan),&#13;
updating it, and bringing it fully in line with current international standards. It will also include&#13;
the preparation of a reference manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
2.18. Both studies will be carried out over a period of a year by short-term consultants&#13;
according to terms of reference which are in the Project implementation file. Assurances have&#13;
been provided by the GOM that the conclusions and recommendations of both studies will be&#13;
the basis of subsequent dialogue with IDA concerning the upgrading of the accounting&#13;
profession and the revision of the accounting plan, and that the recommendations of the study&#13;
will be implemented in light of the dialogue with IDA.&#13;
2.19. The component will also finance a subsequent training program designed to enable&#13;
those with basic qualifications to upgrade their skills and qualify as accounting technicians or&#13;
auditors under the newly adopted stringent minimum requirements for practicing. In particular,&#13;
the component will finance: (i) short-term advisory services for the detailed design of the&#13;
training program, including adaptation of the curriculum for the needs of candidates; the terms&#13;
of reference for the consultant to carry out this task are in the Project implementation file; (ii)&#13;
training seminars for approximately ten candidates in two cycles (about five months apart) of&#13;
three weeks each; this will be carried out by two foreign instructors, assisted by a group of four&#13;
local instructors who will receive on-the-job training, the objective being the provision of basic&#13;
upgrading of skills for candidates to meet the minimum level of qualifications. The courses&#13;
will be operated on a full cost recovery basis. The objective is to ensure a minimum level of&#13;
competency, enabling local accountants to work with foreign accounting firm whose services&#13;
will be needed for the foreseeable future. By bringing foreign and local instructors together, and&#13;
training a modest number of locals who meet basic qualifications, the idea is to promote&#13;
twinning arrangements between foreign accountants and auditors and their local counterparts,&#13;
and provide local with the first level of minimal qualifications, after which they can supplement&#13;
their training with courses abroad or correspondence courses.&#13;
2.20. Assurances have been provided by the GOM that the implementing agency will submit,&#13;
by September 30, 1995 at the latest, a short-list of consulting firms to carry out the detailed&#13;
design and execution of the training program, from which the selection will be made. This will&#13;
ensure that the training program will be clearly defined and ready for launching once candidates&#13;
for the courses have been identified.&#13;
2.21. As shown in figure 2 of the Organization Chart (Annex 5), this component will be&#13;
implemented by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU -- see para.2.50) in collaboration with the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, which will coordinate its efforts with the existing Ordre des experts&#13;
comptables. The objective is to involve member of the profession in implementation of the&#13;
project component, as well as to develop a sense of professional consciousness among&#13;
accountants and auditors which would encourage their espousal of more stringent standards.&#13;
2.22. Support to the Chamber of Commerce (Component 2.b.). Design of this component&#13;
was based on the conclusions of the study of support needed by the private sector, conducted by&#13;
SOFRECO according to terms of reference prepared by IDA and financed by a Japanese grant.&#13;
In the course of subsequent discussions of that study between the GOM and IDA, the Chamber&#13;
of Commerce was selected as the representative agency for private operators and investors of all&#13;
sizes. In French-speaking countries and elsewhere, foreign investors typically turn first to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
local Chamber of Commerce as a repository of information. Other agencies were considered by&#13;
the aforementioned study and, while some may be more developed (e.g. the Confederation&#13;
Ginerale des Employeurs Maurilaniens), their ability to benefit the interests of the private&#13;
sector appears to be limited as they tend to be dominated by large operators and reflect vested&#13;
interests.&#13;
2.23. This component will focus on the strengthening of the Chamber of Commerce through&#13;
the training of newly elected officers and newly appointed staff in administrative skills and&#13;
through the development of basic support services to be made available to private enterprises&#13;
(e.g. information about regulations, international market information and surveys, directory of&#13;
existing facilities and services available to operators in Mauritania, preparation of credit&#13;
applications). This will help make the Chamber of Commerce more responsive to the needs of&#13;
the formal and informal sectors, since both foreign firms seeking entry into the market, and local&#13;
businesses with limited capital, will be able to draw on services like: foreign market advisories,&#13;
sectoral surveys, improved accounting procedures (to facilitate access to bank credit), and&#13;
financial planning. The Chamber of Commerce would also coordinate with donors their&#13;
programs benefiting the private sector, most notably microenterprises.&#13;
2.24. This component will be implemented by the Ministry of Commerce until such time as the&#13;
Chamber of Commerce is fully functional and can operate in conditions of complete autonomy.&#13;
Under this component, the proposed project will finance two consultants who will provide&#13;
short-term advisory services for the reorganization of the existing Chamber and the setting up&#13;
of its basic new structure, which will be carried out over a period of three months. The&#13;
proposed project will also finance the subsequent training of new Chamber of Commerce&#13;
personnel in client relations, administrative techniques and product promotion. Short-term&#13;
advisory services, provided by a consultant, will also help set up and conduct two workshops&#13;
to be administered by the newly reconstituted Chamber of Commerce, bringing together&#13;
representatives of the private sector and government officials. The objective is to sensitize&#13;
government officials to the needs of the private sector, while at the same time enable the&#13;
Chamber of Commerce to gain credibility as a forum for private sector interests. The analysis of&#13;
issues concerning the financing of these entrepreneurs will be closely coordinated with the&#13;
analysis undertaken in the context -of the formulation of the strategy for the second phase of the&#13;
development of the financial sector (see paras. 2.14 and 2.15). The proposed project will also&#13;
finance the purchase of office equipment. The entire program for the development of the&#13;
Chamber of Commerce will be carried out over a period of fifteen months. Thereafter, the&#13;
Chamber of Commerce will operate autonomously, relying for its financing on: (a) dues from&#13;
members; and (ii) other sources, which may include an earmarked allocation of tax revenues.&#13;
One of the key responsibilities of the Chamber of Commerce once it is functional, for which&#13;
funding is available under this component, is to work with representatives of the private sector&#13;
and with the authorities to articulate a strategy for the development of microenterprises,&#13;
including an analysis of the assistance microenterprises may need and ways of promoting donor,&#13;
including NGO, support for microenterprises. The Project will also finance a studies fund which&#13;
will be administered by the Chamber of Commerce, equivalent to US$ 100,000, to which small&#13;
and medium enterprises will have access according to specific conditions. These include the&#13;
following: the enterprise in question must finance a minimum of 50 percent of the cost of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
study upfront, and also must assume all costs in excess of US$20,000. The studies may cover:&#13;
the identification of new markets or products, or the preparation of credit applications.&#13;
2.25. Assurances have been provided by the GOM that it will revise, by December 31, 1995 at&#13;
the latest, the charter of the Chamber of Commerce so as to establish it as an autonomous&#13;
agency empowered to act as a convincing representative of the private sector. This will better&#13;
equip the Chamber of Commerce to represent private sector interests vis-i-vis the GOM in&#13;
accordance with the appropriate Mauritanian law, and advocate laws and regulations favoring&#13;
private sector development. The revision of the charter will be accompanied by a financing plan&#13;
for the Charnber of Commerce detailing anticipated financing from dues and other sources, as of&#13;
the time the elections are held and the Chamber of Commerce is considered fully functional.&#13;
Assurances have also been provided by the GOM that it will submit to IDA, by September 30,&#13;
1995 at the latest, a short list of consultants from which one will be selected to carry out the&#13;
reorganization of the existing Chamber of Commerce, as well as a short list of consultants from&#13;
which one will be selected to implement the training of Charnber of Commerce personnel. This&#13;
will ensure that these two important steps will be carried out without delay as anticipated by the&#13;
implementation schedule.&#13;
2.26. Strengthening of Legal and Judiciary Reform (Component 2.c). The activities to be&#13;
included in this component were agreed with the authorities in light of a discussion of the&#13;
conclusion of a study of the scope for legal and judiciary reform in Mauritania. The study,&#13;
which was financed by a Japanese grant, was conducted by Cabinet Roussel according to terms&#13;
of reference prepared by IDA. Under this component, the proposed project will finance short-&#13;
term advisory services to carry out the following: (i) the revision of the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework pertaining to commercial law, including the investment code and the Code des&#13;
Obligations et des Contrals (1989), to commercial and civil procedural law, including the status&#13;
of the auxiliaires dejustice and expert witnesses, to national and international arbitration, and&#13;
to bankruptcy proceedings; all preceding revisions will be done in both French and Arabic; (ii)&#13;
the establishment of a commercial register for companies; this will include a register for&#13;
ownership titles which can then be used as collateral; (iii) the upgrading of the Journal Officiel&#13;
(Official Bulletin) and its regular publication to report on decisions of the Supreme Court, the&#13;
Courts of Appeal and the Commercial Courts (Chanbre Mixte); and (iv) the implementation of&#13;
a program to ensure electronic indexation of, and the establishment of electronic archives for,&#13;
Mauritanian laws after training by experts from the United States Library of Congress, thereby&#13;
making Mauritanian laws more accessible to interested local and foreign parties.&#13;
2.27. The revision of the legal and regulatory framework will require the services of a&#13;
consulting firn working periodically over a period of three years. It will also cover the&#13;
publication and electronic indexation of the revised legal texts. Especially important in this&#13;
component will be emphasis on evaluating the environmental impact of code revisions, to&#13;
avoid any negative impact on the environment. Owing to the need for extensive coordination in&#13;
the implementation of this component, it will be administered by the Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU -- see para. 2.50 -- which will play a coordinating function in the implementation of the&#13;
proposed project as a whole) under the direct management of the Prime Minister's office. The&#13;
PCU will also assume responsibility for the subcomponent establishing a commercial register.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
The latter subcomponent will require the services of an international expert in commercial&#13;
registers, assisted by a local expert in information system, who will carry out the work over a&#13;
period of twelve months.&#13;
2.28. The electronic indexation of Mauritanian laws, which will be carried out over a period of&#13;
eight months, will require the financing of travel of Mauritanians to the United States to attend&#13;
free training seminars offered to officials at the S&amp;retariat General du Gouvernement by the&#13;
United States Library of Congress. It will also require the financing of the publication of the&#13;
users guide and the needed equipment to carry out the electronic indexation. Given the role it&#13;
plays in the processing of legislation, the Secretariat General du Gouvernement will be&#13;
responsible of the implementation of the electronic indexation of laws (see Figure 2 of the&#13;
Organization Chart, Annex 5). So will the upgrading and regular publication of the Journal&#13;
Officiel, which will require the services of two local legal experts working periodically over a&#13;
period of a year.&#13;
2.29. The proposed project will also finance a training program for magistrates (judges) and&#13;
court auxiliaries (lawyers). This is crucial given the difficulty encountered in enforcing laws, the&#13;
lengthy delays in court procedures, and the unreliable nature of recourse to law in general, all of&#13;
which tends to discourage prospective private sector investors. The training program will entail&#13;
the training of approximately 200 lawyers and 100 judges over a period of two and a half years.&#13;
It will comprise two phases, each consisting of a series of seminars spread over a period of six&#13;
to eight months. Both foreign and local instructors will preside over the seminars from the&#13;
moment of their inception. As the program moves from Phase I to Phase II, the number of&#13;
foreign instructors will decrease and more local instructors, who will have themselves been&#13;
trained during Phase I, will be used. An ideal arrangement would be five foreign instructors&#13;
during Phase I and three during Phase II. The program could be extended thereafter, with local&#13;
instructors taking over, assisted by occasional interventions of foreign experts. The experts&#13;
hired under this component will be specialized in training and will be expected to have close&#13;
familiarity with legal systems applied in Mauritania, especially as these are modified in the&#13;
course of the revision of legal texts under this component. Training will be carried out in both&#13;
French and Arabic and will include language training as needed. Training courses will be&#13;
offered free of charge to lawyers and judges, given the major externalities that would result&#13;
from having adequately trained lawyers and judged thoroughly familiar with the laws and with&#13;
international legal practices as both applies to private sector activities. The component will also&#13;
finance the purchase of equipment for pedagogical purposes (mostly computers and software)&#13;
and the publication of instruction manuals. This subcomponent will be implemented by the&#13;
Direction des Affaires Judiciaires, which will in turn rely on a local Training Coordinator who&#13;
will oversee coordination efforts (see Figure 2 of the Organization Chart, Annex 5).&#13;
2.30. Assurances have been provided by the GOM that the implementing agency will submit,&#13;
by September 30, 1995 at the latest, a short-list of consulting firms to carry out the detailed&#13;
design and execution of the training program, from which the selection will be made. This will&#13;
ensure that the training program will be clearly defined and ready for launching once candidates&#13;
for the courses have been identified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
2.31. Feasibility Study and of a Tax-Free Regime for Exporters (Component 2.d.). With&#13;
a view to fostering export-led growth and eliminating problems stemming from high tariffs&#13;
(effective protection is around 40 percent), this component will finance the short-term advisory&#13;
services to carry out a follow-up to a study already conducted, with financing from a Japanese&#13;
grant, which evaluated options for export-processing zones. That study, conducted by GOPA&#13;
(Gesellschafiffir Organisation, Planung undAusbildung, mbH) according to terms of&#13;
reference prepared by IDA, concluded that the establishment of a tax-free regime (points&#13;
francs) within Mauritania would likely be the best mechanism to foster export-led growth.&#13;
2.32. Following discussions between the GOM and IDA, it was decided that it would be&#13;
advisable to launch a follow-up study to carry out a cost/benefit analysis of this a tax-free&#13;
regime. The study will also make recommendations as to appropriate administrative and legal&#13;
measures that need to be taken. Terms of reference for a short-term foreign consultant to&#13;
conduct a feasibility study are in the Project implementation file.&#13;
2.33. Assurances have been provided by the GOM that the conclusions of the study will form&#13;
the basis of a subsequent dialogue-with IDA, and that the recommendations of the study will be&#13;
implemented in light of the dialogue with IDA, notably with regards to the setting up or no of a&#13;
tax-free regime for exporters. If cost/benefit analysis favors the setting up of such a regime, this&#13;
component will comprise short-term advisory services for the implementation of said regime.&#13;
The study and full implementation of its conclusions is scheduled to take fifteen months.&#13;
Implementation will be the responsibility of the Direction de l 'Industrie at the Ministry of&#13;
Industry and Mining.&#13;
3.    Mining Sector&#13;
2.34. Strengthening of the Mining Sector Framework (Component 3.a.). In order to&#13;
establish an environment conducive to promoting interest in the mining sector on the part of&#13;
private investors, this project will finance the subcomponents listed below. To facilitate the&#13;
administration of the component, the proposed project will finance (under subcomponent (i)&#13;
below), a local coordinator who will be responsible for monitoring the progress on the studies,&#13;
on reorganization efforts at the Direction des Mines et de la Geologie (Mining and Geology&#13;
Directorate) at the Ministry of Industry and Mining, and on the design and administration of&#13;
training courses. (See Figure 2 of Annex 5.)&#13;
(i)   Strategy paper, review of the mining code and of tax code as it applies&#13;
to mining&#13;
2.35. The first subcomponent will focus on policy issues and reforms. The objective is to&#13;
assist the GOM in preparing a clear statement of policies and objectives with respect to the&#13;
development of the minerals sector and devise a consistent strategy to implement policies. For&#13;
this to be achieved, short-term foreign and local consulting firms will be hired to conduct a&#13;
study covering the following areas: role of GOM in the sector, intemational mining cost&#13;
competitiveness, intemational tax regimes, artisanal miningAocal industry development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
prospects, environmental safeguards. Given the large scope of the work involved, emphasis will&#13;
be placed on twinning arrangements between foreign and local consulting firms.&#13;
2.36. Based on the conclusions of the above-mentioned study, the consulting firm(s) executing&#13;
this subcomponent will make recommendations for the revision of the mining code and the tax&#13;
code. In revising the mining code, special emphasis will be placed on evaluating any possible&#13;
impact of regulatory changes on the environment. The completion of study of the mnining code&#13;
and the application of its recommendations are explicitly linked to the fulfillment of the third-&#13;
tranche release condition of the PSDC being submitted to the Board at the same time as this&#13;
project, stipulating the adoption of a new mining code satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
(ii)    Reorganization of the Directorate of Mines and Revision of Cadastral&#13;
Procedures&#13;
2.37. This subcomponent will finance the completion reorganization of the Directorate of&#13;
Mines and Geology, which is the key supervisory body in the mining sector. The&#13;
reorganization, which will be carried out with technical support from a consulting company, will&#13;
be designed to optimize the functions of appropriate supervisory institutions in accordance with&#13;
international standards, define roles and functions for said institutions, establish operating&#13;
procedures, and upgrade ability of all ministries connected to mnining to deliver information&#13;
pertaining to the sector.&#13;
2.3 8. As an extension of the review and strengthening of the institutional framework of the&#13;
sector, this subcomponent will also finance short-term advisory services for the revision of&#13;
cadastral procedures. These services will be provided by a consulting firm which will assist the&#13;
authorities in the setting up of title registry procedures, including the establishment of a&#13;
computerized information system. This will be backed up with the compilation of geological&#13;
information, in such a way that the system could later be extended to a GIS (Geographic&#13;
Information System). In additional, the consulting firm will assist the GOM in defining cadastral&#13;
procedures, will propose criteria for evaluating and granting exploration and exploitation&#13;
permits, and specify all the procedures, quantitative and qualitative data required, information&#13;
on the permit holder, etc.&#13;
(iii)    Training of staff at the Directorate of Mining&#13;
2.39. This subcomponent will finance the training of officials at the Directorate of Mining in&#13;
the following areas: mining economics/finance, environmental, health and safety legislation,&#13;
norm-setting and monitoring, organizational management and investment promotion, mining&#13;
accountancy and tax regimes, and mining cadaster and information systems.&#13;
2.40. The training program will be conducted in parallel to the other two subcomponents, with&#13;
the explicit intention of making the results of the other subcomponents self-sustaining through&#13;
capacity-building which would enable Mauritanian officials to take over the application and&#13;
monitoring of procedures outlined above. In addition, this subcomponent will be designed to&#13;
sensitize and educate key government officials as well as stakeholders in the development of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
sector in Mauritania in the dynamics and the best practices of the world mining industry. It will&#13;
also sensitize government officials to the needs and concerns of the private sector. Many&#13;
seminars will be designed so as to bring officials and other stakeholders in the sector together,&#13;
thereby promoting dialogue and exchange of information.&#13;
2.41. Assurances have been provided by the GOM that the implementing agency will submit,&#13;
by September 30, 1995 at the latest, a short-list of consulting firms to carry out the detailed&#13;
design and execution of the training program, from which the selection will be made. This will&#13;
ensure that the training program will be clearly defined and ready for launching once candidates&#13;
for the courses have been identified.&#13;
2.42. All three subcomponents pertaining to mining will be implemented by the Directorate of&#13;
Mining and Geology at the Ministry of Industry and Mining. The three subcomponents will be&#13;
carried out over a period of a year and a half, their implementation being coordinated to ensure&#13;
proper sequencing. A more detailed implementation schedule appears in Annex 1. More&#13;
detailed terms of reference for the three subcomponents are in the Project implementation file.&#13;
4.    Fishing Sector&#13;
2.43. Survey of Fisheries Resources and Foreign Exchange Flows In and Out of the&#13;
Fishing Sector and Establishment of a Permanent Mechanism for the Monitoring of Said&#13;
Flow. In order to support the GOMNs effort to implement a medium-term strategy for&#13;
developing the fishing sector and actively manage, monitor and promote the sector, this&#13;
component will finance short-term advisory services for a survey of fisheries resources. This&#13;
will include: an assessment of the quantity (statistics) and quality (e.g., product condition) of&#13;
fish, by collecting the statistics pertaining to species by weight and market price will be&#13;
collected, as well the quantities exported by country of destination, customs encountered, and&#13;
enterprises importing. Product quality will be analyzed according to product type (commercial&#13;
versus industrial), quality control at different stages of production, and type of product&#13;
treatment. The survey will also recommend a system for the regular monitoring of foreign&#13;
exchange flows in and out of the sector. The survey will be conducted by a consulting firm over&#13;
a period of six months. The terms of reference for a foreign fishing expert to provide short-term&#13;
advisory services are in the Project implementation file. This component will be implemented by&#13;
the Ministry of Fishing, as shown in Fig. 2 of the Organizational Chart (Annex 5). Assurances&#13;
have been provided by the GOM that the conclusions of the survey will forn the basis of a&#13;
subsequent dialogue with IDA, and that the recommendations of the survey will be implemented&#13;
in light of the dialogue with IDA, notably with regards to monitoring of fishing activities and of&#13;
export operations. The survey will comprise the preparation of an action plan, the&#13;
implementation of which will then be financed by this component. The latter is explicitly linked&#13;
to the conditionality of the PSDC which specifies that, as a condition for second tranche&#13;
release, the GOM will strengthen the monitoring scheme for the export of fishing products.&#13;
This component will also provide financing (equivalent to US$ 100,000) of technical support for&#13;
the CNROP, notably in the area of environmental capacity building and quality control of&#13;
exports, an important consideration given the need to upgrade quality control to meet the&#13;
market access requirements of the European Union which will be enforced as of January 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
2.44. The proposed project will also finance a Project Coordination Unit, an audit of the&#13;
proposed project. (See para. 2.60.) An advance from the Project Prefinancing Facility&#13;
(US$400 thousand) has already been approved and has been used to provide partial financing of&#13;
bank audits as well as the hiring of consultants to evaluate said audits, and also to pay for the&#13;
travel staff at the Secretariat General du Gouvernement who attended training seminars at the&#13;
Library of Congress. (See para. 2:28.)&#13;
C. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
2.45. The total cost of the proposed project, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at US$7.9&#13;
million, with a foreign exchange component of about US$5.1 million (71 percent). Cost&#13;
estimates are based on January 1995 prices, and include physical and price contingencies. Price&#13;
contingencies amount to 3.3 percent of total project costs (excluding the PPF), and are based on&#13;
an assumption of a price escalation of 3 percent per year locally and 2 percent per year&#13;
internationally. A total of US$290,000, or roughly 4 percent of total project costs, is made for&#13;
physical contingencies. A summary of cost estimates is presented in Table 1 on the next page.&#13;
Detailed project cost estimates are provided in Annex 7.&#13;
2.46. The high proportion of local costs (36 percent) reflects efforts made during project&#13;
design to: (i) maximize the capacity-building element in project implementation; (for example,&#13;
all long-term consultants are local); (ii) involve local elements in the technical aspects of the&#13;
work, both to promote capacity-building and to emphasize on-the-job training through joint&#13;
efforts by foreign and local consultants; and (iii) involve the staff of the existing ministries in&#13;
project implementation, follow-up and coordination, with support from a Project Coordination&#13;
Unit (see para. 2.50) which will be temporary in nature and staffed entirely by Mauritanians.&#13;
2.47. The proposed financing plan includes an IDA credit of US$7.2 million equivalent,&#13;
which will finance 91% of the estimated project costs, net of all taxes and duties. This will&#13;
cover all of the foreign exchange costs (US$5.1 million) and 75 % of the local costs (US$2.1&#13;
million). The GOM will finance the remainder of the local costs (US$0.7 million).&#13;

D.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
2.48. Given the multiplicity of subcomponents that are designed to assist the GOM's effort to&#13;
promote the private sector and the extensive need for capacity building in Mauritania in order to&#13;
carry out the reforms envisaged by the PSDC, the following elements have been emphasized: (i)&#13;
close coordination with, and involvement of, counterparts in the GOM; (ii) establishment, based&#13;
on close consultations with the authorities, of an implementation schedules (Annex 1), including&#13;
several intermediate target dates; (iii) establishment, in close coordination with the executing&#13;
agencies, of performance indicators (Annex 3) which will make it possible to track progress in&#13;
all components; and (iv) preparation of a supervision schedule (Annex 4) which identifies the&#13;
input needed for the supervision of the project, including probable timing and scope of&#13;
supervision missions.&#13;
2.49. The executing agencies in charge of the components (see the organization chart in&#13;
Annex 5) will be as follows: (i) the upgrading credit risk information will be implemented by a&#13;
small Implementation Unit at the Central Bank; (ii) the bank training component will also be&#13;
implemented by the same Implementation Unit at the Central Bank; (iii) the development of a&#13;
long-term financing strategy to benefit small- and medium-size enterprises will be implemented&#13;
by the Implementation Unit reporting directly to the Governor of the Central Bank; (iv) the&#13;
development of the accounting and auditing framework will be implemented by the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit (PCU -- see para. 2.50) in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and in&#13;
coordination with the Ordre des experts comptables; (v) the reorganization of the Chamber of&#13;
Commerce to aid in the promotion of the private sector, as well as to provide support services&#13;
to that sector, will be implemented by the Ministry of Commerce until such time as the Chamber&#13;
of Commerce is fully functional and can operate autonomously; (vi) the legal and regulatory&#13;
reform will be implemented by the Directorate for Judiciary Affairs of the Ministry of Justice for&#13;
the training program, the PCU (see para. 2.50) for the revision of legal texts and the&#13;
establishment of the commercial register (the PCU will work under the direct supervision of the&#13;
Prime Minister's Office on the revision of legal texts), and the Secretariat General du&#13;
Gouvernement at the Prime Minister's office for the electronic indexation of laws and the&#13;
improvement and regular publication of an improved Official Bulletin; (vii) the study for the&#13;
possible setting up of pointsfrancs as a mechanism for export promotion will be implemented&#13;
by the Directorate of Industry at the Ministry of Industry and Mining; (viii) the promotion of&#13;
private investor interest in the mining sector will be implemented by the Directorate of Mining at&#13;
the Ministry of Industry and Mining; and (ix) the survey of fishing production and foreign&#13;
exchange flows and the setting up.of a permanent mechanism to monitor said flows will be&#13;
implemented by the Technical Advisor specifically given that responsibility at the Ministry of&#13;
Fishing.&#13;
2.50. It was agreed that the coordination of all project components will be entrusted to the&#13;
Cellule de rehabilitation du sec/eurparapublic established as an executing agency within the&#13;
Ministry of Planning for the Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Project (PESAP, Credit 2167-&#13;
MAU) (see Annex 5, Fig. 3). Said organization will be reconstituted as a Project Coordination&#13;
Unit (PCU) for this project, and will be designated as a temporary structure. The PCU will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
have the advantage of being staffed entirely by Mauritanians; to the extent that it will require&#13;
the hiring of temporary staff to handle the added administrative, accounting and legal burdens&#13;
imposed by the proposed project, the credit will finance the hiring of said staff. It will also&#13;
benefit greatly from the experience acquired during the implementation of the PESAP. The task&#13;
of the PCU will essentially be coordination, not implementation (the latter being left to&#13;
executing agencies), except in the case of the legal component where the need to work with&#13;
numerous different government agencies makes it essential that the PCU, operating under the&#13;
direct command of the Prime Minister's Office, should handle the implementation (see para.&#13;
2.27), as well as the accounting and audit component, where the PCU will work with the&#13;
Ministry of Planning and the autonomous Ordre des experts comptables. In addition, the PCU&#13;
will: (a) assist in the preparation of annual project and Special Account audits (see section on&#13;
Accounting and Auditing) and semi-annual statement of expenditures (SOE) audits, (b) process&#13;
payment requests, (c) enforce budgetary control and (d) ensure compliance with the&#13;
procurement, disbursement and other procedures required by the Bank. The PCU will be under&#13;
the direct supervision of the Minister of Planning and will receive reports and transmit&#13;
information directly to a group of representatives from other ministries associated with the&#13;
Private Sector part of the proposed project (Industry and Mining, Justice, Commerce, and&#13;
Finance). The GOM will appoint a Project Manager who will act as Director of the PCU no&#13;
later than credit effectiveness. Another important role the PCU will have is management of a&#13;
Social Communications Fund to explain and disseminate information about the measures&#13;
undertaken by the GOM in the context of its program. The PCU will also be in charge of&#13;
ensuring maximum client consultation at all stages of project implementation. Agreement was&#13;
reached with the GOM to continue client consultation throughout project implementation, and&#13;
to make extensive use of ZOPP to maximize the efficiency of this participatory effort. The&#13;
proposed project includes financing for two ZOPP workshops. The procedure proposed for the&#13;
workshops, funding for which is included in the budget for the PCU, is described in the Project&#13;
implementation file.&#13;
E. PROCUREMENT&#13;
2.51. Table 2 summarizes project costs by disbursement category and procurement method.&#13;
Mauritania's procurement laws and regulations conform to IDA procurement guidelines. No&#13;
special exemptions, permits or licenses need to be specified in credit documents for international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB), as Mauritania's procurement regulations allow IDA procedures to&#13;
take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations.&#13;
2.52. Consultant services. Consultant services financed by the proposed project (US$3.17&#13;
million) will be contracted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants&#13;
(August 1981). Services to be contracted include technical assistance, studies, training, and&#13;
auditing. Contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 or more for firns or US$50,000 or more for&#13;
individuals will be subject to prior review by IDA.&#13;

2.53  Goods. Goods financed by the IDA credit (US$0.8 million) include computer&#13;
equipment, software, scanner, office supplies, and vehicles. Goods will be grouped into&#13;
packages of at least US$ 150,000 each and procured through ICB in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). The Bank's&#13;
standard bidding documents should be used. A preferential margin of 15% or the applicable&#13;
customs duty, whichever is less, over the c.i.f prices of competing goods for all ICB&#13;
procurement will be given to domestic firms in accordance with Bank guidelines. Because&#13;
foreign bidders are unlikely to be interested in bidding on limited quantities of goods, and local&#13;
firms can produce at competitive prices, goods that cannot be grouped into packages of at least&#13;
US$150,000 each will be procured through NCB provided that the aggregate amount of such&#13;
procurement does not exceed US$0.4 million equivalent. Draft standard bidding documents for&#13;
NCB have been reviewed by and agreed with IDA.&#13;
2.54. Review by IDA. IDA-financed contracts for goods above a threshold value of&#13;
US$150,000 will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. The review process will cover&#13;
56% of the total value of the amount contracted for goods. Selective post-review of awarded&#13;
contracts below the threshold levels will apply to about one in three contracts. Prior IDA&#13;
review will not apply to consultant contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 and&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent for individuals and firms, respectively. However, the exception to prior&#13;
IDA review will not apply to the terms of reference of such contracts, to single-source hiring of&#13;
firms and individuals, to assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA, and to&#13;
amendments of contracts raising the contract value to US$50,000 and US$ 100,000 or more for&#13;
individuals and firms, respectively.&#13;
2.55. Procurement Status of Ongoing Projects and Proposed Arrangements. The GOM&#13;
will take necessary measures to ensure that: (a) procurement phases do not exceed the time&#13;
periods shown in Table 3 below; and (b) customs formalities for importing goods and services&#13;
under the proposed project will be processed within one month of the date of application.&#13;

F. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
2.56. The proposed project is expected to be disbursed over four fiscal years, according to&#13;
categories shown in Table 4. This disbursement is shorter than the profile for the Region, but is&#13;
closely linked to disbursements of the parallel PSDC (see Annex 6). The project is forecast to&#13;
be completed June 30, 1999, and the credit will be closed December 31, 1999.&#13;

TOTAL:                         7.22&#13;
Note:  - Categories 1 through 4 include price contingencies. Category 6 reflects physical contingencies&#13;
financed by the Project.&#13;
- All items financed by IDA are exclusive of taxes and duties.&#13;
- Percentages of IDA financing are rounded.&#13;
- The average of 75 percent for operational costs reflects a declining scale of financing, namely: 90&#13;
percent in FY 96 and FY97, and 70 percent thereafter.&#13;
2.57. All disbursements of the IDA credit will be based on full documentation, except for&#13;
contracts of less than US$150,000 equivalent (except for consultants), which will be submitted&#13;
on the basis of SOEs. SOE ceilings for consultants will be US$100,000 for firms and&#13;
US$50,000 for individuals. The Project Coordinator will have the responsibility for the&#13;
preparation of withdrawal applications for all components. The documentation for withdrawals&#13;
under SOEs will be retained at the Ministry of Planning for review by IDA staff during&#13;
supervision missions and for regular semi-annual audits.&#13;
2.58. To facilitate disbursement, the GOM will establish (a) a Project Account for the GOM's&#13;
counterpart funds; and (b) a Special Account in the Central Bank to cover IDA's share of&#13;
eligible expenditures. The initial deposit of US$50,000 equivalent into the Project Account will&#13;
be a condition of effectiveness to cover the GOM's contribution to financing in the first year,&#13;
which will be small given that financing of operational costs will be on a declining basis (see&#13;
Table 4 above.). Also, an initial deposit of US$500,000 equivalent will be made into the Special&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
Account from the proceeds of the proposed credit upon effectiveness. IDA will replenish the&#13;
special account monthly, upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of incurred eligible expenditures,&#13;
with supporting documentation, copy of an up-to-date bank statement and a reconciliation form&#13;
showing the status of funds at the moment a request for replenishment has been submnitted to&#13;
IDA. Details of the establishment and operations of the Special Account and other&#13;
disbursement procedures have been discussed and agreed upon during preappraisal discussions&#13;
with the authorities. An agreement was also reached that adequate budgetary provision for&#13;
local costs will be inscribed in the annual operating budget of the Ministry of Planning. The&#13;
estimated disbursements, by fiscal year, allocation, and component of the proposed IDA credit&#13;
are shown in Table 5.&#13;
G. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
2.59. Monitoring and evaluation of project performance will be carried out by the&#13;
implementing units over the life of the proposed project, with the PCU playing a coordinating&#13;
role. Key monitoring indicators are shown in Annex 3. In its role as Project Coordinator, the&#13;
PCU will: (i) organize, in June of each year, a joint IDA-Government review of project&#13;
implementation, based on the progress reports and on an annual work program and budget for&#13;
the next year; (ii) carry out a mid-term review of project implementation, jointly with IDA in&#13;
July 1997. Details on IDA's supervision plan and on the mid-term review are provided in&#13;
Annex 4. Based on the results of the mid-term review, the GOM will prepare and implement&#13;
an action plan, acceptable to IDA, for further implementation of the proposed project.&#13;
Assurances have been provided by the GOM to this effect.&#13;
H. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
2.60. The PCU will establish and maintain, in accordance with International Accounting&#13;
Standards, separate accounts and records to be used exclusively for the Capacity Building&#13;
Project. Since the PCU will take over the accounting system already being applied by the&#13;
Cellule de la rehabilitation du secteurparapublic. Audits of project accounts will be carried&#13;
out annually, in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, by an independent auditor&#13;
under an annually renewable contract acceptable to IDA. The reports will be submitted within&#13;
six months of the end of each fiscal year. Disbursements under the SOEs will be audited semi-&#13;
annually. Assurances have been provided by the GOM that the Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU) in the Ministry of Planning will submit to IDA: (i) a semi-annual report on the progress&#13;
of project implementation; (ii) annual work programs and budgets for the following year&#13;
(including the GOMs contribution to the financing of the proposed project), no later than&#13;
October 31 st of any one year; and (iii) an implementation completion report, according to terms&#13;
of reference acceptance to IDA, within six months of the credit closing date describing the&#13;
proposed project's implementation as well as current and future costs and benefits derived. An&#13;
independent auditor will be appointed as of the date of credit effectiveness. This auditor will be&#13;
selected to carry out an audit that has been elaborated according to standard terms of reference&#13;
which have been agreed with the GOM.&#13;

I. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
2.61. The Capacity Building Project does not present the prospect of any detrimental&#13;
environmental impact. The Project was designed to ensure no detrimental impact of the&#13;
environment. To the extent that it promotes the development of the fishing and mining sectors,&#13;
which can have environmental implications, the following steps have been taken to ensure that&#13;
the impact will be neutral: (a) institutional strengthening for the CNROP, will include a budget&#13;
for environmental capacity building; (b) legal and judicial reform, which will include the revision&#13;
of codes affecting business, will emphasize the environmental dimension; and (c) the mining&#13;
sector component includes environmental capacity building at the Directorate of Mining, and&#13;
emphasizes the role of environmental protection in the revision of the mining code.&#13;
2.62. Mauritania's environment is fragile given: (i) the exposure of its predominantly bare&#13;
surface to wind erosion; and (ii) the fast growth of urban areas. The GOM, the United Nations&#13;
Sudano-Sahelian Office (UNSO), and other agencies are focusing on the crucial problem of land&#13;
degradation manifested in Mauritania, most visibly in the form of dune encroachment. The&#13;
urban explosion calls for measures to address issues, such as the water supply and sewage&#13;
disposal. To facilitate the link between environmental matters and broader developmental&#13;
strategies, the GOM is working with the World Bank and other partners on a National&#13;
Environmental Plan. Depletion of fisheries resources is another problem and, certainly, the&#13;
survey of fish resources component of this project will help to provide a more precise estimate&#13;
of the country's resources.&#13;
J. PROJECT RISKS AND BENEFITS&#13;
2.63. The key focus of the proposed project is making the regulatory and institutional&#13;
framework for private sector development conducive to attracting private investment. As such,&#13;
the implementation of the proposed project is closely tied to the reforms envisaged under the&#13;
PSDC being presented to the Board at the same time as this proposed project. In the process,&#13;
the proposed project aims at promoting the following: (i) better quality banking services and a&#13;
better financial sector framework through programs to upgrade the skills of bank supervisors&#13;
and commercial bank personnel, accountants, auditors, magistrates and other legal personnel;&#13;
(ii) improved access to detailed information on the credit standing of borrowers and on arrears&#13;
through revamping the Centrale des Risques and the Centrale des Impayes; (iii) an enhanced&#13;
legal and accounting framework which will allow for more transparent procedures and foster&#13;
accountability and financial discipline in the financial and private sectors; and (iv) an ongoing&#13;
dialogue between the private sector and the GOM, as well as a solid mechanism for extending&#13;
support services to aid the development of the private sector.&#13;
2.64. As the reform measures supported by the PSDC are carried out with technical support&#13;
extended under the proposed project, and as the project components are implemented over the&#13;
next four years, the expectation is that Mauritania will have become more attractive to foreign&#13;
and local private investors. The private sector will be better informed about investment&#13;
opportunities, relevant laws and regulations and existing support services. Regulators will have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
been made more conscious of the need to enforce regulations in a uniform and rigorous manner,&#13;
and will have better tools at their disposal (improved credit information, improved accounting&#13;
and auditing framework) to carry out their duties. The legal and regulatory framework will&#13;
have become more transparent, more responsive to private sector needs and more enforceable.&#13;
The fishing sector will be functioning more efficiently as the GOM disengages itself from&#13;
production and marketing and carries out its supervisory function, with a special emphasis on&#13;
resource conservation. The mining sector will offer more attractive opportunities to investors&#13;
as the mining code and taxation of mining will have become more investor-friendly, and as&#13;
procedures will have been streamlined and made more transparent.&#13;
2.65. The proposed project emphasizes institutional support and capacity building in the&#13;
ministries as well as supervisory and regulatory agencies. Most of the funds are devoted to&#13;
overhauling, reorganizing, strengthening, modernizing, and upgrading the efficiency of the&#13;
Ministry of Justice, the Direction des Mines el de la Geologie, and the Central Bank. Training&#13;
is a key element in this approach; training costs represent 25 percent of total project costs.&#13;
Another factor that is specifically incorporated in this project is the need to ensure broader&#13;
access to information, so as to promote greater transparency and better understanding of&#13;
existing regulations. This is represented by the attention given to the Centrale des Risques and&#13;
the Centrale des Impayes, the upgrading of the accounting and auditing framework, the&#13;
improvement of the Journal Officiel, and the electronic indexation of Mauritanian laws, the&#13;
setting up of the Chamber of Commerce as a repository of infornation on the economy and on&#13;
existing regulations for use by investors, the upgrading of cadastral procedures to ensure a&#13;
better and more transparent allocation of mining concessions, the carrying out of an survey of&#13;
the resources of the fishing sector, and the setting up of a mechanism for monitoring the flow of&#13;
funds for exports and imports by the fishing sector.&#13;
2.66. The success of the proposed project is not completely assured. The vested interests&#13;
within Mauritania may resist or try to dilute the positive effect of the reform measures,&#13;
especially those providing support for the programs geared to upgrading and enforcing&#13;
regulation of the fishing sector. However, the GOM has given every indication that it has a&#13;
sense of participation and ownership in the proposed project and that, in the interests of&#13;
promoting the private sector, it is committed to seeing it carried out successfully.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
III. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
3.01. The GOM has submitted a Statement of Policy (Annex 2) which defines its commitment&#13;
to private sector development. This policy statement endorses policy measures to be taken in an&#13;
effort to realize the development of the private sector, in general, and the financial, fishing, and&#13;
mining sectors. These policy measures, which appear as tranche release conditions in the&#13;
PSDC which is being presented to the Board at the same time as this project, can be&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   Progressive implementation of the first phase of the access fees system for&#13;
demersal and cephalopod (deep sea) fishing, said fees being fixed set to rise to 11&#13;
percent of the estimated value of production by mid- 1997.&#13;
(b)   Adoption by the Assembly of a new Banking Law satisfactory to the Bank and&#13;
its continuous application thereafter.&#13;
(c)   Recovery of an additional UM 800 million by ARCB in 1995 and UM 700&#13;
million in 1996.&#13;
(d)   Formulation, in agreement with the Bank, of new standards for the accounting&#13;
and auditing professions, and adoption of said standards.&#13;
(e)   Launching of invitation to submit bids in the context of the action plan for the&#13;
privatization of MAUSOV and ALMAP in case decision is made not to liquidate&#13;
one or both of them.&#13;
(f)   Strengthening of the monitoring scheme for the export of fishing products, and&#13;
completion of the second phase of the study of taxation of the fishing sector.&#13;
(g)   Revision of commercial code, investment code, arbitration and bankruptcy rules,&#13;
and the code of civil and commercial procedures in accordance with the study&#13;
completed in January 1995.&#13;
(h)   Revision and adoption of a new Mining Code satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
3.02. In addition to the aforementioned policy measures, the following specific assurances,&#13;
pertaining to this proposed project, have been provided by the GOM:&#13;
(a)   That the implementing agency will submit, by September 30, 1995 at the latest, a&#13;
short-list of consulting firms from which the selection will be made to complete&#13;
the detailed design of, and to carry out, the training programs financed under this&#13;
project. (See paras. 2.13, 2.20, 2.25, 2.30 and 2.41.)&#13;
(b)   That the conclusions of the studies financed under this project will: (i) form the&#13;
basis of a subsequent dialogue with IDA, and that their recommendations will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
implemented in light of the dialogue with IDA, and (ii) be disseminated to the&#13;
public through workshops or conferences organized under the initiative of the&#13;
GOM, and short publications to be made available to the public. (See paras.&#13;
2.16, 2.18, 2.33 and 2.36 and 2.43.)&#13;
(c)   That by December 31, 1995 at the latest, the Chamber of Commerce will be&#13;
established as an autonomous agency empowered to act as a convincing&#13;
representative of the private sector. (See para. 2.25.)&#13;
(d)   That the PCU, in its role as Project Coordinator, will: (i) organize, in June of&#13;
each year, a joint IDA-Government review of project implementation, based on&#13;
the progress reports and on an annual work program and budget for the next&#13;
year; (ii) carry out a mid-term review of project implementation, jointly with IDA&#13;
in July 1997. (See para. 2.59.)&#13;
(e)   That the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the Ministry of Planning will submit&#13;
to IDA: (i) a semi-annual report on the progress of project implementation; (ii)&#13;
annual work programs and budgets for the following year (including the GOM's&#13;
contribution to the financing of the proposed project), no later than October 31 st&#13;
of any one year; and (iii) an implementation completion report, according to&#13;
terms of reference acceptance to IDA, within six months of the credit closing&#13;
date describing the proposed project's implementation as well as current and&#13;
future costs and benefits derived. (See para. 2.60.)&#13;
3.03. The effectiveness of this credit will be subject to the following conditions:&#13;
(a)   Appointment of an independent auditor to carry out an audit according terms of&#13;
reference which will be finalized during negotiation. There is no need to agree on&#13;
an accounting system being in place by project effectiveness, as the PCU will&#13;
take over the accounting system already in use by the Cellule de la rehabili1ation&#13;
du secteurparapublic. (See para. 2.60.)&#13;
(b)   Appointment of a Director of the PCU. (See para. 2.50.)&#13;
(c)   Initial deposit in the Project Account. (See para. 2.58.)&#13;
3.04. Recommendation. Subject to the above terms and condition, the proposed project&#13;
would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$7.2 million equivalent on standard IDA terms.&#13;

Islamic Republic of Mauritania&#13;
LETTER OF SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY&#13;
FOR THE FINANCIAL AND PRIVATE SECTORS&#13;
(Translated from French)&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.     Mauritania's financial system and private sector have undergone far-reaching changes during the last few&#13;
years. In the context of the continuous dialogue established between the World Bank and the Government of the&#13;
Islamic Republic of Mauritania, and particularly of the negotiations concerning the 1994-97 economic policy&#13;
framework paper, we should like to set forth the broad lines of our development policy for the financial and&#13;
private sectors.&#13;
2.     First of all, however, it will be useful to describe the overall economic setting within which this policy is&#13;
to be implemented.&#13;
1. MACROECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK&#13;
A.    Status of the Economic Reform Program&#13;
3.     Since 1992, on the basis of the fourth framework paper, drawn up at the end of that year, Mauritania&#13;
has stepped up its adjustment efforts aimed at correcting the structural imbalances that have accumulated since&#13;
the 1970s, in order particularly to limit the deterioration of the macroeconomic situation that characterized the&#13;
first two years of the decade. With the support of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the&#13;
GOM has drawn up an economic recovery plan, the broad lines of which were set forth in the 1992 framework&#13;
paper and which was subsequently revised to take account of exogenous developments and the progress achieved&#13;
in implementing the program.&#13;
4.     The GOM's strategy has put the emphasis on continuation of the liberalization policy initiated in 1986 in&#13;
the context of the adjustment programs (supported by the 1987 SAC, the 1989 PASA and the 1990 PASEP),&#13;
whiclh have contributed greatly to the goals of substantial liberalization of the economy, increased private-sector&#13;
participation in economic activity and a greater role for market forces.&#13;
5.     The economic difficulties (fall in export receipts, relaxation of budgetary and monetary policies and loss&#13;
of solvency of certain banks) encountered during the period 1990-91, owing essentially to exogenous factors,&#13;
were rapidly overcome as a consequence of Mauritania's continued restructuring efforts and its evolution toward&#13;
a democratic system.&#13;
6.     In order to contain these problems, in October 1992 the GOM embarked on an ambitious program of&#13;
action designed to rekindle the adjustment process and deepen the structural reforms. The implementation of&#13;
these important reforms in the various areas has yielded positive results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 2 of 21&#13;
7.     Price instability has been brought under control, wvith an estimated rate of inflation of 3.8 percent in&#13;
1994. The economic growth rate for the period 1993-94 was close to 5 percent, against an original target of 3.5&#13;
percent.&#13;
8.     Mauritania's current monetary and budgetary policies have been implemented in conformity with the&#13;
prograrn drawvn up together with the IMF and the World Bank and set forth in the 1995-97 econornic policies&#13;
frarnework paper. More resolute application of monetary policy has enabled Mauritania to combat inflationary&#13;
trends and cope With the fall in export prices more effectively.&#13;
9.     Despite the decline in inflation, the rediscount rate has been maintained at I1 percent, and the ceiling on&#13;
lending rates, currently 20 percent, is being progressively relaxed. The experience gained with the Public&#13;
Treasury bonds auction system introduced in June 1994 will henceforth serve, among other purposes, as basic&#13;
indicator for setting base rates, and base lending rates have been liberalized. The minimum remuneration on&#13;
deposits has been abolished.&#13;
10.   The price stability that has prevailed since devaluation confirmns that Mauritania has conserved the gains&#13;
achieved in export competitiveness. All the measures geared to the deregulation of the foreign exchange and trade&#13;
system, provided for in the program, have been implemented.&#13;
11.    The free foreign exchange market is operating normally and without restrictions with respect to&#13;
operations in invisibles, and the banks have gained experience in transactions in foreign currency transactions.&#13;
This market has been opened to non-banking foreign exchange houses in order to stimulate competition and take&#13;
a first step toward a true exchange market. Foreign currency transfers to finance the imports of goods and&#13;
scrvices are authorized in this market.&#13;
12.    Turning to foreign debt, Mauritania is on good terms with its various creditors. Arrangements on terms&#13;
broadly comparable to those accorded by the Paris Club were obtained in 1984, and an armngement wMith the&#13;
FKDEA is imminent. The introduction of the auction system for import licenses, the conclusion of rescheduling&#13;
agreements, the settlement of public arrears, and the abstention from contracting new loans on non-concessional&#13;
terms are major steps in the right direction.&#13;
13.    In December 1994 Mauritania requested the second arrangement under the Enhanced Structural&#13;
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) at the IMF, in collaboration With the World Bank. The major benefits gained by the&#13;
arrangement were: (i) maintenance of price stability through continued application of restrictive budgetary, fiscal&#13;
and monetary policies; (ii) creation of a transparent, market-linked exchange and international trade system in&#13;
order to stimulate competition and eliminate the obstacles to investment and production; (iii) reform of the legal,&#13;
judicial and regulatory framewvork; (iv) refomi of the fishing sector through the installation of a transparent&#13;
system based on access fees (taxes based on the expected value of production), the strengthening of surveillance,&#13;
the move toward the privatization of marketing, and the adoption of an exit mechanism for non-viable enterprises;&#13;
(v) strengthening financial intermediation, and (vi) resolution of the extemal debt problem.&#13;
14.    The program's macroeconomic objectives are as follows: (i) a sustained average economic growth rate&#13;
of 4.4 percent, thus assuring a moderate increase in income and consumption per capita; (ii) stabilization of&#13;
annual inflation at about 3 percent, and (iii) reduction of the external current account deficit (excluding official&#13;
transfers) from 14.2 percent of GDP in 1994 to 6.4 percent in 1997, together with an increase in the Central&#13;
Bank's intemational reserves so that they cover imports for 2 months in 1995 and 3 months by 1997. The key&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
ANNEX TI&#13;
Page 3 of 21&#13;
factor in achieving such a growth rate would be expanded private sector investment apart from that undertaken&#13;
by the mining company. Investment should rise from about 13 percent in 1994 to about 15 percent in 1997. In&#13;
addition, investment aimed at raising the value added of exports of fish and mineral products, together with a&#13;
more liberalized economic environment, should enhance the productivity of existing capital. In order to narrow&#13;
the external and domestic imbalances, it is projected that the fiscal deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP in 1994 will be&#13;
transformed into a small surplus in 1997. The net reimbursement of government debt to the local banking sector&#13;
would create possibilities for the satisfaction of the private sector's financing needs, as well as permit a growth of&#13;
the money supply compatible with the program's inflation goal.&#13;
B.     Relative importance of the financial and private sectors&#13;
15.    The economic setting described above brings out the importance of the financial and private sectors in&#13;
the GOM's medium-term strategy. It goes without saying that improving the situation of the external sector will&#13;
depend in large part on increasing exports, which can only be achieved by assigning a more dynamic role to the&#13;
private sector. The GOM is therefore acting to improve the sector's incentives structure, especially in the area of&#13;
export promotion.&#13;
16.    Outside the external sector, the private sector has an extremely important role to play in the process of&#13;
expanding economic activity and thereby rekindling econormic growth. The GOM sees the private sector as the&#13;
driving force of the economy, in line with the strategy of trimming the role of the public sector (reflected in its&#13;
public enterprises reform program instituted in 1989 with the support of the World Bank, which granted a&#13;
structural adjustment credit for the sector and a technical assistance credit for implementation of the reform&#13;
measures). Expanding private-sector activity has thus become a top-priority goal in order to stimulate&#13;
employment and mitigate the negative impact on it of budgetary and monetary austerity and to ensure the high&#13;
level of budget receipts required to be able to achieve the program's macroeconomic objectives.&#13;
17.    The financial sector also has a key role to play in the GOM's program. In the first place, the soundness&#13;
of its macroeconomic policy wvill depend on the future health of the banking sector. The GOM has already stated&#13;
its intention not to grant any financial support to the banks from now on. It is therefore essential that the banks&#13;
regain their profitability and pursue their development in a context of strict compliance with the prudential&#13;
regulations.&#13;
18.    The GOM's macroeconomic policy will be reflected in the immediate future in tightening of policiies for&#13;
managing demand, and the consequent reduction in absorption will necessarily be accompanied by an increase in&#13;
saving. In addition to the efforts of the authorities in the taxation area, this will call for action to revitalize the&#13;
financial sector's capacity to mobilize resources. Efficient financial intermediation must play a larger role in the&#13;
channeling of funds toward the most remunerative economic uses.&#13;
ll. REFORM OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR&#13;
19.    The first bank restructuring program, which covered the period 1988 to 1990, was implemented vith&#13;
substantial support from the World Bank. It was among the financial components financed by a structural&#13;
adjustment credit. The results of this restructuring did not entirely come up to expectations. In particular:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 4 of 21&#13;
(a)    This first restructuring exercise did not basically alter the way the banking system functions. It&#13;
remained largely dominated by the state, which until 1990 was owner of the country's twvo largest banks (UBD&#13;
and BNM) and co-owner of the Chinguitty Bank.&#13;
(b)    The rehabilitation was only partial, since the need for provisions to cover possible borrower&#13;
default was under-estimated.  In this context the (public) banks remained dependent upon Central Bank&#13;
refinancing operations for their daily cash flow, thereby preventing implementation of a judicious monetary policy&#13;
based on an indirect control of liquidity.&#13;
(c)    The State's intervention in the activity of the banks caused the latter to incur risks, especially in&#13;
the fishing sector, whose activity posted negative fluctuations.&#13;
20.    After audits of the situation of the banks, as of June 30, 1993, were completed in December 1993, bad&#13;
debts rose again to UM 18.84 billion (US$151 million or 60.1 percent of bank loans), part of which (at least UM&#13;
5 billion) represented bad debts transferred to the state but still carried on the balance sheets of certain banks.&#13;
The uncertainty that afflicted the sector led to a general slowdowvn of the credit system, which penalized the&#13;
private sector in particular.&#13;
21.    In light of this situation the monetary authorities, with the support of the IMF and the World Bank,&#13;
instituted a major program of reform of the financial sector. The first phase of this program, restructuring of the&#13;
banking system, is now nearing completion. Its most important measures were as follows:&#13;
(a)    The GOM wvithdrew from the banking system completely and transferred all the shares it held in&#13;
the banks to the private sector, except for the Chinguitty Bank, to which it is linked through international&#13;
commitnents.&#13;
(b)    The Union of Development Banks (Union des Banqtues de Developpemenf-UBD), the only&#13;
development financing agency, was liquidated on June 24, 1993.&#13;
(c)    All the development banks were financially  rehabilitated  by  means of substantial&#13;
recapitalization.&#13;
(d)    Supervision and oversight of the banks was strengthened, and vigorous measures are currently&#13;
being implemented to provide the Central Bank with all the tools it needs for efficient quality control; the World&#13;
Bank fumished substantial assistance, through its Institutional Development Fund.&#13;
(e)    An ambitious, precise and monitored programn  is under way of recovcry of bank debtor&#13;
balances transferred to the GOM's portfolio, just as of all other receipts. A recovery agency has been set up for&#13;
the purpose. The recovery target for 1994 (UM 600 million) has already been achieved.&#13;
22.    The GOM now proposes, with the continued help of the IMF and the World Bank, to launch the second&#13;
stage of the banking sector reform program, i.e. the consolidation stage. The main objectives of this stage are to:&#13;
(i) consolidate the bank rehabilitation and debtor balances recovery process; (ii) institute a stricter supervision&#13;
system in order to avoid any repetition of banking crises; (iii) strengthen the skills of bank management staff, (iv)&#13;
promote investnient financing through markct mechanisms, and (v) improve the incentive structure of the banking&#13;
system and thereby enhance the efficiency of financial intermediation.&#13;

ANNEX 11&#13;

A.    Consolidating the Restructuring of the Banking System&#13;
23.    As mentioned above, during 1993 the GOM maintained a dialogue with the commercial banks while&#13;
carrying out technical studies designed to identify ways to definitively rehabilitate the banking system. These&#13;
technical studies received substantial support from the World Bank, which helped to finance them. The GOM&#13;
felt that, in withdrawing from the banking system, it wvas incumbent upon it to bear part of the restructuring costs.&#13;
However, all bank owners were constrained to make a substantial contribution in order to restore the financial&#13;
health of their respective institutions.&#13;
24.    The cost of rehabilitating the commercial banks has thus been bome by the private owners as well as by&#13;
the GOM. The GOM's involvement was due to the followving considerations: (i) the GOM could not wvithdraw&#13;
from the sector without bearing part of the rehabilitation costs, having regard to its responsibility as a former&#13;
shareholder with, in the case of one bank (BNM), a major role in management, and (ii) the banks' losses were due&#13;
in large part to non-repayment of loans by public enterprises. This being so, the cost to the GOM was UM 4&#13;
billion, wvhich falls within the budgetary and monetary limits established in the Policy Framework Paper. By Nvay&#13;
of comparison, the costs borne directly by the other owners of the banks total so far the equivalent of UM 4.55&#13;
billion. Following the payment of UM 2.3 billion to BNM in the form of bonds and cancellation of liabilities to&#13;
the Central Bank, the GOM became the owner of a portfolio previously held by the BNM with a nominal value&#13;
equivalent to the same arnount. These credits were added to those of the UBD whiich are managed by the ARCB&#13;
(Agence pour le recouvrement des creances bancaires).&#13;
25.    The GOM's strategy for successful implementation of the commercial banks restructuring program for&#13;
commercial banks is based on the following measures:&#13;
(a)    Bad debt recovery. The GOM has drawn up a plan of recovery of bad debts held by the&#13;
ARCB, with the following recovery targets:&#13;
December 31, 1994: UM 600 million&#13;
December 31, 1995: an additional UM 800 million&#13;
December 31, 1996: an additional UM 700 million&#13;
The first recovery target, that of 1994, has already been met. The above timetable represents a realistic&#13;
recovery plan compared with the targets adopted at the beginning of 1993. This is mostly due to the delays in the&#13;
transmission of loan files from the BNM to ARCB; the process was completed in October 1994. Note however&#13;
that according to an analysis perforned by several experts, the proposed recovery ratio represents the maximum&#13;
that could be expected, given the poor quality of the loan documentation delivered to the GOM. It should be&#13;
noted also that the banks themselves are successfully pursuing recovery of the loans remaining in their portfolio.&#13;
(b)    Compulsory recapitalization of all banks. The GOM has already notified all the banks that&#13;
they will have until March 31, 1995 to complete their recapitalization so as to bring them into compliance with&#13;
the capital adequacy ratio in force (8 percent of assets), taking into account the data deriving from the&#13;
compulsory audits completed in January 1995. On the basis of these audits and with the increase in BNM's&#13;
capital, all banks have been adequately recapitalized. A additional capital increase of UM 700 million has also&#13;
bcen decided by the Board of BAMIS. Said capital wiJl be paid up during the first half of 1995.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX II&#13;
Page 6 of 21.&#13;
(c)    Submission of medium-term financial programming plans to the Central Bank by all the&#13;
banks, detailing their strategies to ensure profitability. The GOM also inforned the banks that they are&#13;
required to present to the Central Bank before March 31, 1995 financial programming plans sununarizing their&#13;
strategy for regaining profitability. Note that this represents the final stage of the financial restructuring of the&#13;
banks, which are henceforth private (except for one of them) and completely autonomous. These plans are the&#13;
exclusive responsibility of the primary banks. Said plans were received and are being used as guidelines for&#13;
evaluating future financial performance by the banks. The plans will fuirnish a point of departure so that by the&#13;
bank supervision authority can evaluate the banks' evolution in terms not only of financial accounting but also of&#13;
implementation of a coherent strategy for regaining their profitability. This will make it possible to set up&#13;
indicators wvhereby crises can be anticipated well in advance.&#13;
26.    The GOM is consulting with the World Bank in order to implement a debt reduction operation for short-&#13;
term extemal loans. Completion of this operation can only strengthen the financial situation of the entire banking&#13;
system. Concerning the part of the debt not covered and deposited in ouguiyas by the banks with the Central&#13;
Bank, the GOM wishes to deal with this problern in close consultation with the World Bank.&#13;
B.     Strengthening Bank Management and Staff Skills&#13;
27.    In parallel with strengthening of the financial sector regulatory frameework, the GOM intends to require&#13;
the banks to undertake major capacity strengthening of their capacity so as to avoid repetition of the past mnistakes&#13;
that led to the deterioration in the financial situation of the banking sector. This wrill be done by setting up,&#13;
trining courses, under the aegis of the Central Bank and with the technical and financial assistance of the World&#13;
Bank under its Capacity Building Project (CBP) for the financial and private sectors. The training courses will&#13;
be of two kinds:&#13;
(a)    Professional training, which will take place in a training center where the emphasis will be&#13;
placed initially on training of trainers, designed to provide continuous training of bank management and line staff.&#13;
The training will comprise local courses covering, inter alia, the following topics: loan approval procedures,&#13;
bank accounting, liquidity management, resource mobilization, documentation of credits and internal auditing.&#13;
(b)    Diploma training, spread over three years, designed to train the banks' future management and&#13;
line staff.&#13;
28.    The banks will be required to participate in the professional training courses, which they will later be&#13;
able to strengthen by means of intemal training courses tailored to their specific needs and long-term strategy.&#13;
C.     Incentive Framework for the Financial Sector&#13;
29.    In order to redress the problems stemming from the relative lack of incentive to Mauritania's financial&#13;
sector to mobilize savings and the limited financial deepening of its economic system, the GOM will continue to&#13;
implement the following measures:&#13;
(a)    Maintenance of a positive interest rate in real terms. At the same time, the banks will continue&#13;
to be entirely free to set their deposit rates, the ceiling on six-month deposits (7 percent) having been abolished in&#13;
January 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX TT&#13;
Page 7 of 21&#13;
(b)    Continuation of the periodic public treasury bond auctions instituted in June 1994, as provided&#13;
for in the program contained in the Policy Framework Paper. The creation of a treasury bonds market furnishes&#13;
an important instrument for both management of the public debt as well as the conduct of monetary policy. At&#13;
the same time it makes it possible to set up a true money market, enabling the banks to manage their surplus&#13;
liquidity, and this wvill encourage them to mobilize resources. It is also expected, in view of the development of a&#13;
market for Treasury debt instruments, that monetary policy will increasingly be implemented through indirect&#13;
instruments of control. This will make it possible to reexamine the required reserve ratio and gradually to&#13;
abandon credit ceilings on individual banks by the end of 1996. To ensure transparency and encourage wider&#13;
participation in bond auctions, the results are now published in the newspapers and the minimum purchase&#13;
amount has been substantially reduced. To encourage the development of a secondary narket, the Central Bank&#13;
has stated that it is prepared, effective January 1, 1995, to intervene on the market in order to enlarge it and to&#13;
implement monetary policy. The monetary policy instruments will be increasingly linked to the functioning of the&#13;
market, in accordance with the mechanisms devised, w%ith the assistance of the IMF, in February 1994. Since&#13;
September 1994 this has included access to a Central Bank rediscount window based on Treasury instruments&#13;
within the framework of monetary policy constraints as laid down in consultation with the IMF. The ceiling on&#13;
lending rates has been relaxed. This rate has risen from 18 percent to 20 percent at the end of 1994.&#13;
(c)    Maintenance of the system of incentives to banks to mobilize deposits of Mauritanians living&#13;
abroad, i.e. authorization to the banks to freely deploy the foreign exchange captured through these accounts.&#13;
D.    Investment Financing&#13;
30.    Since the liquidation of the UBD, the country's only development financing agency, the Mauritanian&#13;
financial system has been characterized by the absence of long-term resources, the only ones suitable for finance&#13;
investment projects. In light of the great need for such financing, as evidenced by the banks' current volume of&#13;
lending operations, the GOM considers it urgent and essential that a mechanism be set up through Nwhich to&#13;
alleviate the current deficiencies and promote the creation of new instruments.&#13;
31.    To this end the GOM, with the support of the World Bank, undertook a study of this question which&#13;
focused on examination of possible mechanisms and comparison with experience in other countries. The study,&#13;
and the ensuing dialogue with the World Bank, yielded a number of important recommendations, including the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)    Emphasis needs to be placed on mobilizing Mauritanian and foreign savings. This includes&#13;
savings of Mauritanians resident in the country itself (particularly rural savings, in which local banks are&#13;
beginning to show interest), savings of Mauritanians living abroad, and foreign savings which could be channeled&#13;
through local financing mechanisms if the latter prove to be attractive.&#13;
(b)    The possibility should be exanmined of setting up an investment bank, on condition that the&#13;
GOM's shareholding in it is limited (a maximum of 20 percent would be desirable) in order to avoid a repetition&#13;
of the UBD situation.&#13;
(c)    The possibility should also be considered of setting up a specialized institution (for example, a&#13;
housing bank). on condition that it is adequately capitalized, that there is limited governmnent participation and&#13;
that its activities are closely monitored, particularly with respect to asset/capital ratio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
ANNEX II&#13;
Page 8 of 21&#13;
(d)    In order to promote long-tern financing, the feasibility of setting up a guarantee fund should be&#13;
studied, on condition that it not be financed out of budget resources or counterpart funds.&#13;
(e)    SME (small and medium enterprises) financing could be promoted through the fornation of&#13;
mutualist groups whose primary purpose would be to mobilize the savings of the members of the group and&#13;
channel them toward the most promising uses.&#13;
32.    These conclusions reflect the GOM's policy as expressed in the new Banking Law. At the same time, the&#13;
GOM feels that it would be appropriate to carny out a more detailed examination of the issues raised by the&#13;
above-mentioned study and to pursue the dialogue with the World Bank concerning themn, with a view inter alia to&#13;
harnessing the support of private investors and donors for the next stage of development of the financial sector.&#13;
33.    To this end the GOM, under the CBP, w%ill carry out a second study, with the following objectives: (i) a&#13;
more thorough analysis of the prospect for savings mobilization; (ii) an appraisal of various alternative ways to&#13;
finance investment, given that certain circles in the Mauritanian and foreign private sector have shown interest;&#13;
(iii) an examination of the role of institutional investors (insurance companies, social security, postal checking&#13;
service-CCP) and of ways of steering them towvard the financing of investment, and (iv) preparation, where&#13;
appropriate, of material for promoting approved courses of action among private investors.&#13;
34.    The GOM undertakes, in light of the findings of that study, to pursue the dialogue with respect to the&#13;
second stage of development of the financial sector. It will coordinate its sectoral development strategy with the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
E.     Regulatory Structure&#13;
35.   In view of the prime importance of strict application of a coherent, clearly-defined and adequate set of&#13;
prudential regulations, the GOM has already instituted an intensive program of action to strengthen the structure&#13;
of regulation and oversight of the banking sector.&#13;
36.    Under the aegis of the IMF, the GOM has launched a process of strengthening the Central Bank's&#13;
management and line personnel skills. This effort has also been supported by a grant from the Bank's&#13;
Institutional Development Fund. With financial support from the IMF, the Central Bank has recruited an expert&#13;
adviser on supervision of banks and banking oversight. In parallel, the Institutional Development Fund grant has&#13;
enabled the Central Bank to review the current banking regulations, the procedures through which the regulations&#13;
are applied and the banking accounting plan.&#13;
37.    With the support of the World Bank through the IDF grant, the Central Bank has carried out the&#13;
followving: (i) the launching of training courses for Central Bank management and staff covering banking&#13;
oversight, intemal auditing and information system; (ii) the preparation of bank supervision and bank portfolio&#13;
appraisal manuals, and (iii) the improvement of the infomiation system as well as the establishment of bank data&#13;
transmission procedures.&#13;
38.    A draft revision of the Banking Law has been prepared, covering provisions relating to the granting of&#13;
loans to bank shareholders, to managers and to staff, and to increase disciplinary penalties for failure to comply&#13;
with the rules of sound management as defined by the banking regulations. This draft law, which has been the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
ANNEX II&#13;
Page 9 of 21&#13;
subject of discussions with the World Bank, will be finalized in consultation with the Bank and will be presented&#13;
to Parliament at its next session in June 1995.&#13;
39.    The Central Bank will require the banks to be in compliance with the banking regulations by June 30,&#13;
1995, on which date it will begin to apply the penalties instituted at the beginning of the year. From that date, the&#13;
transmission of bank data, preparation of on-site and off-site inspection reports, and application of the bank&#13;
accounting plan will be effected in conformnity w ith the procedures established during 1994.&#13;
40.    By the end of 1995 the Central Bank, with the help of the World Bank through the CBP, will have&#13;
updated the Credit Risk Information System (Centrale des Risques) and the Credit Arrears Information System&#13;
(Centrale des Impayes), using a more highly developed information system. These two centers will improve the&#13;
availability of data on borrowers and enable the banks to check on the financial status of each loan applicant and&#13;
the existence of any other debts already secured by the collateral offered by the applicant.&#13;
41.    It should be added that the regulatory structure of the banking sector will also be strengthened with&#13;
support from two components of the Bank's Capacity Building Project (CBP): first, revision of the national&#13;
accounts chart and strengthening of the accounting and auditing professions, and second, revision of the business&#13;
legislation (for example, to facilitate application of the debt recovery law) and strengthening of legal staff&#13;
capacities.&#13;
III. REFORMS SUPPORTING THE PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
42.    A comerstone of the GOM's strategy of promoting the growth of the private sector consists of action to&#13;
encourage private-sector activity in the form of measures to improve the incentives system, reform the regulatory&#13;
fiamcwork and strengthen the institutional framework.&#13;
43.    The GOM's approach is based on the hypothesis that Mauritania's private sector is best able to create the&#13;
jobs necessary to absorb the labor force created by a growing population. The sector is moreover destined to play&#13;
a key role in export expansion, necessary to improve Mauritania's extemal situation. The GOM's objective is&#13;
therefore to promote private-sector activity in general and encourage export growth in particular.&#13;
A.     Improvement of the Incentive Framework&#13;
44.    The restauration of macroeconomic stability which has taken place during the last few months represents&#13;
a substantial improvement in the framework of incentives to private activity. The estimated inflation rate for&#13;
1994 of 3.8 percent means that it will be much easier for private entrepreneurs to program their activities. The&#13;
relatively low inflation rate since the 27-percent devaluation of the ouguiya in October 1992 enhances the&#13;
economic competitiveness of activities based in Mauritania.&#13;
45.    In addition, the progressive deregulation of prices and trade opens up the prospect of an increasingly&#13;
distortion-free economic system in which relative prices reflect the economic costs of production. The GOM has&#13;
decided to put the emphasis on improving the other types of incentives to private economic activity. The main&#13;
target of the GOM's proposed reform is the foreign exchange system. The GOM has stepped up its efforts to&#13;
liberalize the exchange system since 1992, for example by abolishing export licenses and the preferential&#13;
exchange rate accorded to Mauritanians living abroad. Note that the differential between the official exchange&#13;
rate and the parallel rate has narrowed substantially since the October 1992 devaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
ANNEX II&#13;
Page 10 of 21&#13;
46.    In February 1993, the GOM instituted an auction system for licenses to import, lirnited to imports&#13;
financed by the Central Bank. Since March 1994, the commercial banks have been authorized to hold foreign-&#13;
exchange accounts abroad, to which they have access to pay for imports. Also from that date, exporters have&#13;
access to 5 percent of foreign exchange receipts from exports of services and 10 percent of those from goods&#13;
exports.&#13;
47.    From July 1, 1994 the GOM widened the auction system to include all imports except fuel and fishing-&#13;
sector imports. It should be noted that the effect is to raise the proportion of exchange operations covered by the&#13;
auction system from 49 to 60 percent of the total controlled by the Central Bank (the part not controlled by it&#13;
consists essentially of imports covered by foreign exchange receipts freely available to the SNIM).&#13;
48.    From September 1994 the percentages of access by exporters were doubled, to 10 percent for services&#13;
and 20 percent for goods. Also noteworthy is the creation of 12 foreign exchange offices on March 31, 1995,&#13;
with the authorization of the Central Bank. At the same time, the scope of the operations in which the&#13;
commercial banks may engage on the free market has been widened to include foreign exchange purchases for the&#13;
settlement of goods and services import transactions and current private transfers.&#13;
49.    A study will be conducted by the end of April, 1995, with the help of the IMF, to identify the modalities&#13;
of a unified exchange rate system. Exchange rate policy will be directed to narrowing the gap between the official&#13;
rate and that of the free market and the parallel market, wvith the objective of eliminating the practice of multiple&#13;
exchange mtes by the end of December 1995. The improvement in the external current account, the total&#13;
climination of public and private external arrears in 1995, the reform of the fishing sector and the application of&#13;
stringent budgetary and monetary policies should facilitate exchange rate unification and the transition toward a&#13;
more liberal exchange system and prepare Mauritania to accept the provisions of Article VIII (sections 2 through&#13;
4) of the IMF's Articles of Agreement.&#13;
B.     Institutional Framework&#13;
50.    To improve the dialogue betveen the Government and the private sector, the GOM proposes to set up a&#13;
private-sector consultation mechanism. This structure will bring together representatives of the private sector,&#13;
ensure continuous and open dialogue between the govemment and the private sector and help the GOM and the&#13;
donors to define their policy of support to the sector.&#13;
51.    In 1994 the GOM carried out a study, financed by the Japanese grant administered by the World Bank,&#13;
aimed at designing the best possible scheme for setting up an institution that would serve as spokesman for the&#13;
private sector in any dialogue with the GOM, furnish support to private-sector operators and investors, both&#13;
Mauritanian and foreign, that seek to play a role in the economy, and help donors to channel their assistance to&#13;
the private sector. The conclusions of this study were the basis of important discussions between the authorities&#13;
and the Bank. It was subsequently decided to undertake the following action: (i) to designate the Chamber of&#13;
Comnnerce as the private-sector support agency; (ii) to take the necessary steps, with the financial assistance of&#13;
the World Bank, to reorganize of the Charnber of Commerce, including its charter (before end-1995) as an&#13;
autonomous institution, and the choice, by election, of a new president; (iii) to select and train the Chamber's staff&#13;
and procure the necessary equipmcnt to enable the Chamber to be functional by June 1996, and (iv) to train the&#13;
Chamber's staff and, in consultation with representatives of the private sector and the donors, set up mechanisms&#13;
enabling the Chamber to contribute to the promotion of the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
ANNEX ll&#13;
Page 11 of 21&#13;
52.    Another study was conducted in 1994, again financed by the Japanese grant administered by the World&#13;
Bank, to assess the feasibility of setting up one or more free trade zones or systems within Mauritania. This&#13;
feasibility study showed that a free trade regime (sysIeme de points francs) for new exporters is currently the&#13;
most suitable wuy of accomplishing this purpose under the socioeconomic conditions prevailing in Mauritania.&#13;
Such a system could help greatly to promote export-oriented production, especially for food products, in which&#13;
Mauritania possesses a comparative advantage. The GOM therefore proposes to conduct a detailed study of the&#13;
feasibility of such a system, again under the CBP. The study will seek to define the arrangements for setting up&#13;
free trade points, particularly with respect to the necessary administrative, legal and regulatory measures. A&#13;
decision whether to set up such a scheme will be taken by June 1996 at latest. If it is decided to do so, a deadline&#13;
of December 1996 is envisaged by which to establish the free trade points system and adopt the necessary&#13;
regulations.&#13;
C.     Business Laws and Regulations&#13;
53.    The GOM considers it essential, as a basic condition for injecting dynamnism into the private sector, that&#13;
an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework be created that ensures legal security in the conduct of&#13;
business, inviolability of contracts, recoverability of bank loans and transparency of and better access to laws and&#13;
regulations.&#13;
54.    With this in mind the GOM has conducted a study, financed by the Japanese grant administered by the&#13;
World Bank, designed to identify the essential components of a program of reformn of the legal and judiciary the&#13;
framework. The study yielded a detailed analysis of the deficiencies of the current system, together with a&#13;
comprehensive plan of action covering: (i) the revision of laws and regulations that create problems in the&#13;
conduct of business; (ii) the implementation of an ambitious program of training of judges, lawyers and paralegal&#13;
personnel, and (iii) the development of a data base to provide an exhaustive compendium of Mauritanian laws,&#13;
their regular and speedy publication in the Official Gazette (Journal Officiel) and the incorporation of the&#13;
compendium into an international information network. On the basis of these recommendations the GOM&#13;
negotiated World Bank financing, under the CBP, of the following components of the reform of laws and&#13;
regulations governing the private sector:&#13;
(a)    The revision of the principal elements of the regulatory framework relating to business, in&#13;
accordance wkith the very detailed recommendations produced by the above-mentioned study, in order to fumish&#13;
an envirormient favomble to Mauritanian and foreign private investment. The most important part of the&#13;
technical work wvill be launched during the coming months with a view to adopting the nev versions of the&#13;
commercial and investment codes, an improved set of arbitration rules and clearly-defined bankruptcy rules,&#13;
among other legal reforms, by December 1996. This will be accompanied by the establishment of a commercial&#13;
register (of property).&#13;
(b)    The strengthening of the legal institutions, in accordance with the recommendations of the&#13;
above-mentioned study, and implementation of a program of training for judges and paralegal staff; this program&#13;
will be started in January 1966.&#13;
(c)    The establishment of a data bank on legal texts and regulations in effect in Mauritania, using a&#13;
classification system that ensures rapid and easy access; the manual necessary to this operation is scheduled to be&#13;
ready by December 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX II&#13;
Page 12 of 21&#13;
(d)    Also under the CBP the reorganization, expected by December 1995, of the accounting&#13;
profession by preparing a plan of action and identifying the necessary components of a program to strengthen the&#13;
accounting and auditing framework; revision of the national accounting plan and the mandatory auditing rules,&#13;
and preparation of a new accounting procedures manual, by April 1996; promotion of the accounting profession&#13;
through the adoption, by April 1996 at the latest, of professional standards that ensure a high quality of service,&#13;
and training of auditors and accountants, to be spread over the years 1996 and 1997.&#13;
IV. FISMHNG SECTOR&#13;
55.    In 1993 the fishing sector accounted for 48 percent of Mauritania's total current receipts (excluding&#13;
official transfers); realization of the sector's potential ranks among the GOM's highest priorities. The recent fall&#13;
in fishery export receipts underscores the importance of speedy implementation of the GOM's plan of action.&#13;
Reform of the fishing sector forms an integral part of the GOM's program. Its sectoral development strategy is&#13;
described in detail in the separate letter of development policy for the fishing sector.&#13;
V. MINING SECTOR&#13;
56.    Mauritania enjoys favorable geologic conditions, such that the mining sector represents a major source&#13;
of national wvealth. A number of mineralized zones (notably gold and copper deposits) have been identified in&#13;
Mauritania; interest on the part of geological investors is relatively low, however, owing to the inadequacy of&#13;
available geologic data and the limitations of resources available to the government agencies responsible for the&#13;
sector.&#13;
57.    Deposits of gold and certain base metals have been worked for a number of years or have recently been&#13;
discovered within the subregion (Mali-Ghana). It is therefore hoped that Mauritania, with a legal and tax codes&#13;
framework that is competitive in light of international practices and with an adequately developed geologic data&#13;
base, Will experience strong growth in the precious and non-ferrous metals sector.&#13;
58.    Mauritania's mining industry is currently dominated by iron ore which, with reserves totaling several&#13;
billion tons, will continue to occupy a leading place in the economy during the decades to come. The World Bank&#13;
has vigorously supported the development of this activity and has carried on a sustained dialogue with the GOM&#13;
concerning ways to promote investnment in the mining sector. In light of these discussions the GOM has drawn up&#13;
a sectoral development program wNith the following major components:&#13;
(a)    Fornulation, in consultation with the World Bank, of a strategy for the mining sector that spells&#13;
out the sector's development goals, together with the necessary incentive measures to make it more attractive to&#13;
private investors; this strategy will be formally adopted in December 1995.&#13;
(b)    Adoption of legal and tax frameworks that are competitive with those of other mining-oriented&#13;
countries; the new mining and tax codes applied to niining will be adopted by December 1996.&#13;
(c)    Strengthening of the government institutions responsible for regulation and oversight of the&#13;
mining sector; to that end, the GOM proposes to adopt and apply new procedures within the Mining Directorate&#13;
(Direction des Mines) by June 1966, together vith new cadastrai procedures which will take effect in March&#13;
1997.&#13;

LETTER OF SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY&#13;
FOR TBE FISHERIES SECTOR&#13;
(Translated from French)&#13;
.1.    As part of the ongoing and open dialogue established in 1985 with the international donor&#13;
communitv, the Government of Mauritania sets out below the thrust of its policy to revitalize the fisheries&#13;
sector based on sustainable and balanced development.&#13;
Backaround&#13;
2.     Since 1985, with the support of the intemational donor community, the Government of Mauritania&#13;
has worked to overcome the adverse effects of the economic and financial crisis of the 1980s and to&#13;
remodel its economy on the bases of competitiveness and social betterment within a framework of greater&#13;
institutional democratization and respect for the major macroeconomic equilibrium.&#13;
3.     Given the importance of fish resources to the general development of the country in terms of value&#13;
added, budget receipts and inflows of foreign exchange, the Government has formulated a development&#13;
policy tailored to that sector.&#13;
4.     Following a number of studies and analyses, in April 1987 the Governnent adopted a development&#13;
policy statement for the fisheries sector, which focused on the rational economic utilization of the country's&#13;
resources in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), based on a new system of access and exploitation that&#13;
facilitated the integration of fisheries activities into the national economy.&#13;
Performance&#13;
5.     The implementation of the new fisheries policies dramatically reshaped the sector, by opening the&#13;
way for:&#13;
(a)    the establishment of a national industrial-scale fleet for deep-sea fishing, i.e. 110 cold&#13;
storage vessels and 45 refrigerated trawlers;&#13;
(b)    the development of a traditional fishing fleet;&#13;
(c)    the construction of onshore freezing and storage facilities;&#13;
(d)    an increase in national production;&#13;
(e)    the introduction on international markets of Mauritanian fish products with a higher value;&#13;
(f     national benefits in terms of jobs and products wvith a higher value added.&#13;
6.    In tandem with these encouraging developments, the sector faced major problems, namely:&#13;
(a) over-indebtedness with the banks;&#13;
(b) obsolescence of a portion of the national fleet;&#13;
(c) insufficient resources for scientific research;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60&#13;
ANNEX rl&#13;
Page 15 of 21&#13;
(d) overfishing of the preferred target species.&#13;
7.     In an effort to inject new life into the sector, the Government has just formulated a new sectoral&#13;
policy. This letter of development policy sets forth its objectives and strategies.&#13;
Maior obiectives&#13;
8.     The Government's objectives for the sector will henceforward be prioritized as follows:&#13;
8.1    compile data and ensure the preservation and protection of fish resources through rational&#13;
management and surveillance to ensure their continued availability;&#13;
8.2   turn the fisheries sector into a catalyst for growth in GDP by maximizing value added, in particular&#13;
through the processing of products, vocational training and creation of local jobs;&#13;
8.3    maximize net foreign exchange gains:&#13;
(a)    by increasing and diversifying sector exports through new products, access to new markets&#13;
and constant upgrading of quality;&#13;
(b)    by reducing the foreign exchange costs of sector operations (foreign labor, ship repair,&#13;
refueling);&#13;
8.4    ensure that the sector generates an optimum volume of tax receipts.&#13;
Strateojes&#13;
9.     With a view to achieving these objectives, in accordance with the measures contained in the&#13;
Economic Policy Framework Document, the Governmnent - together with its development partners - will&#13;
implement a consistent strategy supported by an action plan specifying the measures to be taken as well as&#13;
an appropriate investment program for the various branches of activity in the fisheries sector.&#13;
A.     Research of Fisheries&#13;
10.    Despite the efforts by the Centre National de Recherches Oceanographiques et des Peches&#13;
(CNROP), data on fish resources remain insufficient with regard to biological balance, reproduction and&#13;
balanced economic exploitation of target species.&#13;
11.    With a view to increasing the data on fish resources for the ultimate goal of rational and prudent&#13;
resource management, the CNROP needs to be reorganized and strengthened, which would entail a&#13;
reformulation of its missions.&#13;
12.    This reformulation and strengthening of the CNROP's mission would cover three main areas in&#13;
particular:&#13;
(a)    better knowledge of the fisheries sector environment with formulation of periodic research&#13;
plans and the establishment of a specialized, multi-disciplinary team;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61&#13;
ANNEX II&#13;
Page 16 of 21&#13;
(b)    resource management through the issuance of fishery maps, classification of commercial&#13;
species in terms of biological properties and availabilitv, evaluation of the permissible annual catch in view&#13;
of changes in potential, a study of the most appropriate fishing equipment and the monitoring of its impact&#13;
on the resource;&#13;
(c)    sanitary control of onshore plants and products of the sea, in the form of authorization of&#13;
handling companies and health certification of products in accordance with intemational standards.&#13;
13.    The following measures have already been carried out:&#13;
(a)    a decree dated March 2, 1994 has reorganized and redefined the mission of CNROP;&#13;
(b)    a five-year development plan covering the period 1993-1998 has been forrnulated outlining&#13;
main direction in CNROP's research. Said plan has been supplemented with an increase in the budgetary&#13;
allocation allowing for its implementation.&#13;
(c)    the scientific views of CNROP concerning the permissible level of fishing has been&#13;
officially published.&#13;
B.    Maritime surveillance&#13;
14.    To improve the protection of fish resources, the Govemment has created, at the Ministry of Fishing&#13;
and Maritime Economv, a department responsible for surveillance and oversight at sea, in accordance with&#13;
Decree 94.125 issued December 31, 1994. In this context, the Government has decided:&#13;
(a) to transfer budgetary resources and equipment from the Fishing Command to this department,&#13;
which wvill enjoy the necessary autonomy in the financial, personnel and resources areas, and will be in&#13;
charge of enforcing compliance with laws and State regulations at sea.&#13;
(b)    to amend the fisheries and merchant marine codes as necessary in order to better reflect&#13;
new aspects of maritime activity (rescue and pollution control) and ensure that proper disciplinary&#13;
measures are taken in the event of violations, as well as the effective collection of penalties;&#13;
(c)    to strengthen the airbome and sea-going capacity in order to improve the scope and quality&#13;
of maritime surveillance.&#13;
(d)    to insist on absolute respect of fishing zones and of limits and fishing equipment as&#13;
reconmmended by CNROP.&#13;
(e)    to collect fines (equivalent to 80 percent of fines due at a minimum) accrued by violators&#13;
during the previous fiscal year.&#13;

ANNEX II&#13;
Page 17 of 21&#13;
15.    Missions&#13;
In addition to fisheries surveillance, which is its main function, the department will:&#13;
(a) combat marine pollution;&#13;
(b) Wipe out illegal marine trade;&#13;
(c) enforce national legislation and regulations related to vessel safety and hygiene;&#13;
(d) participate in sea rescue operations.&#13;
16.    Institutional framework&#13;
The Marine Surveillance and Oversight Department will be attached to the Ministry of Fisheries&#13;
and Maritime Economic Activities. It will have financial and functional autonomy.&#13;
17.    Sea and air capacitv&#13;
The Department will be provided with appropriate resources, which will be supplemented by a&#13;
procurement and replacement program.&#13;
18.    Personnel&#13;
The Department's manning table will include the mnilitary personnel necessary to crew the ships,&#13;
aircraft and radar stations that will be assigned to it in accordance with current regulations.&#13;
19.    Cost and financing&#13;
The maritime surveillance budget has three chapters:&#13;
(a)    normal operations, covering the wage bill as well as the operating costs connected with&#13;
surveillance equipment;&#13;
(b)    maintenance costs, including careenage and servicing of surveillance equipment;&#13;
(c)    the investment program, including new purchases of equipment.&#13;
The surveillance operating budget is financed exclusively from the State budget. The Government&#13;
is seeking donor assistance for the financing of the last two chapters.&#13;
20.    Violations&#13;
The Government will revise the Fisheries Code as it relates to maritime surveillance so as to&#13;
include, in particular for serious infractions, mandatory re-routing of ships and the posting of a mandatory&#13;
temporary bond equivalent to the applicable minimum penalty prior to any legal proceedings or&#13;
adrrinistrative action, for which the cases will be precisely defined. Likewise, the procedure for penalty&#13;
collection will be both strengthened and streamlined. In addition, the pertinent judicial and adninistrative&#13;
personnel will receive appropriate training in fishing violations.&#13;

C.     Resource mana2ement&#13;
21.    As of January 1, 1995, the Government will irnplement a newv fish resource management system,&#13;
taking into account both economic and biological considerations. The Government's primary concern is to&#13;
avoid the risk of overfishing, wvhich can threaten the very existence of fish resources, and to optimize&#13;
exploitation in terms of the economic results for Mauritania. The new system will be applied to the twvo&#13;
main types of export-oriented fishing, i.e. demersal (deep-sea) and pelagic (surface) species.&#13;
22.    To that end, the Government will allocate the resource on the basis of the permissible potential and&#13;
the optimum fleet level, which will be set annually for each type of species.&#13;
23.    For bottom species fishing, the Government will introduce an access fee in 1995 that will gradually&#13;
replace, over a three-year period, current taxation based on export duties. The access fee will stand at 2&#13;
percent (1995), then 8 percent (1996) and then 11 percent (1997) of the estimated value of production. The&#13;
reform is intended to improve the efficiency of the national fleet, by introducing incentives for production&#13;
and fleet replacement, while simultaneously ensuring that the Public Treasury receives an appropriate level&#13;
of receipts. The first phase of this access rights regime has begun to be applied under Finance Law 1995.&#13;
In this contexct, the Government will continue the study of the tax system as it applies to fisheries so as to&#13;
assess its efficacy.&#13;
24.    For surface species, the Government wvishes to provide access to this significant resource to all&#13;
interested parties and in particular those who are potential investors in onshore processing. Open licenses&#13;
have been offered via international competitive bidding as of September 1, 1994.&#13;
25.    Capture quotas  will be determined annually by the Minister of Fisheries, who is also the&#13;
competent authority for authorization of access to the resource. These fishing permits will be given&#13;
exclusively to boats. In addition, an auctioning committee for pelagic fishing licenses for national and&#13;
foreign operators has been instituted, and will also be in charge of monitoring access fees assessed against&#13;
the of demersal and cephalopod (both deep-sea species) fishing. This committee, presided over by the&#13;
Ministry of Fishing, comprises also the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank.&#13;
26.    The Government will encourage the development of coastal fishing which represents high value&#13;
added and new jobs. It will consequently make regular adjustments for the different types of species,&#13;
reflecting changes in traditional fishing. It will also help improve infrastructure for unloading and&#13;
processing, and ensure that storage and freezing capacities match the development of production. It will&#13;
encourage the renovation and adaptation of existing facilities to meet the dictates of product revaluation.&#13;
To that end, it will in particular promote commercial and industrial joint ventures for processing and&#13;
packaging plants. The Government will also implement the practical measures needed to implement the&#13;
plan for the privatization/liquidation of ALMAP and MAUSOV.&#13;
27.    The Government %kill use appropriate provisions to promote a climate attractive to foreign&#13;
investors, who can be instrumental in improving the integration of the fisheries sector into the national&#13;
economy. That effort will take the form of incentives under the general investment code, foreign exchange&#13;
legislation and corporate law.&#13;

D.     Sectoral infrastructure&#13;
28.    Sectoral production costs should fall folloving the improvements in conmmon infrastructure.&#13;
Planned investments will be limited to the major basic infiastructure vital for sector promotion, so as to&#13;
preserve the major economic equilibrium as part of the ongoing structural adjustment process.&#13;
29.    In this context, the Government will build a pipeline in Nouadhibou to bring in diesel oil for boat&#13;
fuel. It wvill also complete its efforts to remove obstacles and plans to support the construction of a ship&#13;
repair yard.&#13;
30.    The Govemment wants to create a new fishing center in Nouakchott, in order to promote a more&#13;
geographically balanced and better distributed development of the fisheries sector. To that end, it plans to&#13;
construct a fishing wharf and related facilities that would help open up the coast.&#13;
31.    In the short term, it is also planned to establish two units that would provide rescue and fire-&#13;
fighting services at Nouakchott and Nouadhibou ports.&#13;
32.    Because of the priority now  accorded to the export of fresh and processed products, the&#13;
Government wvill upgrade the airstrips at Nouakchott and Nouadhibou and will build in-bond cold storage&#13;
facilities there.&#13;
E.     Sector financina&#13;
33.    The Government would like the donor commrunity to make funding available for the financing of&#13;
investments (ships, rehabilitation and new projects) and lines of credit to meet the sector's financing needs.&#13;
F.     Marketingk&#13;
34.    In order to improve marketing, the Government has decided to liberalize the exportation of all fresh&#13;
products in any form as well as processed products such as filleted, salted, dried and pressed fish. The&#13;
liberalization of processed demersal fish will be carried out gradually. Such liberalization will be consistent&#13;
with the regulations and practices protecting the interests of the national economy (foreign exchange,&#13;
taxation, brand image).  In particular, the rules of international trade must be respected and private&#13;
economic interest groups promoted.&#13;
35.    All products frozen onshore or at sea other than pelagics remain the exclusive domain of the&#13;
Fishery NIarketing Board (SMCP), to allow for economies of scale and to avoid any fragrnentation of&#13;
supply in a very specific market. The privatization of 65 percent of SMCP was completed in September&#13;
1994, and will be accompanied by the strengthening of control of exports of fish products.&#13;
36.    To promote foreign trade, in association with sector agents, the Government will establish a Fish&#13;
Export Promotion Center (market identification, clientele research, tracking of prices on the international&#13;
market and at unloading). It will also apply the required hygienic and sanitary standards to fish products&#13;
destined for export.&#13;

G.    Vocational trainina&#13;
37.    With a view to short-, medium- and long-term human resource management planning through&#13;
consistent training projects, the Government has drafted a four-year training and employment plan, which&#13;
will seek to develop national resources in line with the demand for skilled labor in the sector.&#13;
38.    In related sectors, the Government will develop basic, advanced and continuing trairing in order to&#13;
upgrade skills in those sectors.&#13;
39.    With a view to improving the latter stages of training, the Government has also approved&#13;
legislation and regulations that would make it mandatory for all crews on board ships flying the&#13;
Mauritanian flag to include two trainees (a student officer and a trainee crew member).&#13;
H.    Institutional and incentives framework&#13;
11.1   Institutional framework&#13;
41.    The success of the fishery policy hinges largely on the institutional capacity for resource&#13;
management, oversight and in particular regulation of fishing. Together with a strengthening of research,&#13;
surveillance and training capacities, the Ministry of Fisheries will be restructured and given resources&#13;
commensurate with its objectives.&#13;
42.    A new Mferchant Marine Code has been adopted in December 1994 ed in order to improve the&#13;
administration of sector activities and implementing decrees will be adopted to supplement existing&#13;
legislation.&#13;
43.    One of the priority tasks of the Ministry of Fisheries and Maritime Economic Activities will be to&#13;
promote and reorgarize the sea-going trades in order to ensure that training leads to the actual employment&#13;
of a growing number of Mauritanian seamen and officers.&#13;
44.    In addition, Mauritania will seek to improve international cooperation in fishing natters. In this&#13;
connection, it vill strengthen its consultation with its partners on the management of migratory species.&#13;
H.2   Incentives framework&#13;
45.    The investment code, which is now being revised, will strongly promote the development of coastal&#13;
fishing, product processing, joint ventures and the introduction of appropriate taxation.&#13;
46.    In addition, steps will be taken to control the price of sector inputs. The Government will also&#13;
encourage all those working in the sector to buy locally produced inputs and to use supply pools for the&#13;
sake of economies of scale.&#13;
47.    The Government will maintain ongoing consultations with the private sector, which will take the&#13;
form of more frequent contacts culminating in conferences and workshops on sector-related issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 21 of 21&#13;
I.     Fishinz-related occupations&#13;
48.    The Government will help improve organization among sector workers so that they are better&#13;
informed about resources and markets and are able to comply with the new standards required by the&#13;
international markets.&#13;
49.    Sector operators will be encouraged to join economic interest groups (GIEs). One GEE, consisting&#13;
of producer-exporters of pelagic products, and another of producer-exporters of fresh, salted and dried fish,&#13;
will be created, with a participation by the State which cannot exceed 35 percent.&#13;
J.     Environment&#13;
50.    The Government plans to implement an appropriate strategy to protect the marine environment,&#13;
upon which the durable preservation of marine resources largely depends. It is in particular aware that&#13;
Mauritania's coast is an invaluable part of the world's marine assets.&#13;
51.    As marine environmental protection begins with an understanding of its parameters, scientific&#13;
research and monitoring programs will receive support. In this connection, the research conducted by the&#13;
CNROP in conjunction with the Banc d'Arguin (PNBA) will be supported and coordination among the&#13;
entities involved will be ensured so as to protect breeding areas in particular.&#13;
52.   With a view to eliminating polluting discharges into the sea, especially from hydrocarbons, the&#13;
enforcement of legislation will be tightened in tandem with the establishment of waste recovery capacity.&#13;

            Mauritania - Capacity Building Project for
            the Development of the Private Sector

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Capacity Building
            Project for the Development of the Private Sector are to: 1)
            encourage investor interest in pursuing opportunities in the
            private sector, especially in the mining and fishing
            subsectors, via revision of the commercial and tax codes as
            well as other activities designed to enhance entrepreneurial
            dynamism and efficiency; and 2) strengthen the financial
            sector, so that it can better provide credit and banking
            services needed by the private sector. The project will
            finance the following three subcomponents: 1) upgrading of
            credit risk and borrower arrears information; 2) training in
            banking; and 3) study for the formulation of a strategy for
            the second phase of financial sector development. With
            respect to the private sector institutional and regulatory
            framework, the project will finance the following: 1)
            upgrading of the accounting and auditing framework; 2)
            support to the Chamber of Commerce; 3) strengthening of
            legal and judiciary framework; and 4) feasibility study of a
            tax free regime for exporters. In the fishing and mining
            sectors, the following components will be financed by the
            project: 1) strengthening of the regulatory and
            institutional framework of the mining sector; 2) survey of
            fishing resources, establishment of a monitoring mechanism
            for fish exports and strengthening of environmental and
            quality control capabilities.
