Rural Poverty in the Northeast&#13;
1.3   The Northeast has long constituted the single largest area of rural poverty in Latin&#13;
America. This Region, covering nine states and part of a tenth, accounts for 19% of&#13;
Brazil's total land area and almost 30% of its 148 million population (1993). More than&#13;
half of all Brazilian poor, and almost two-thirds of the country's rural poor, live in the&#13;
Northeast where, according to a World Bank Poverty Assessment in Brazil, annual per&#13;
capita incomes of rural inhabitants reach only US$230 (less than one-tenth of the national&#13;
average).' Among the underlying causes of rural poverty in the Northeast are the&#13;
relatively poor resource base of large parts of the region and variable agro-climatic&#13;
conditions which make them vulnerable to drought. Skewed access to land and the virtual&#13;
absence of a functioning rural financial system for the poor are additional constraints.&#13;
Northeast agriculture is characterized by limited input use and slow rates of technology&#13;
adoption. Productivity is low, with output per farm worker less than half that of other&#13;
regions. Overall Northeast agricultural GDP growth was negligible during 1991-1994.&#13;
1.4    About 40% of the Northeast's rural population lives in the interior semi-arid zone&#13;
characterized by poor soils and severe, cyclical and often protracted drought. The&#13;
"drought polygon" in the semi-arid region includes most of Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte,&#13;
Paraiba, Piaui, Pernambuco and Bahia, and smaller proportions of all the other&#13;
Northeastern states except Maranhao. The remainder of the rural population lives in areas&#13;
which are generally more humid and have better soils, the coastal belt and the drought-&#13;
prone transitional zone between the coast and the semi-arid area. The rural economy&#13;
revolves around food crops including fruits and vegetables, and extensive irrigated&#13;
commnercial export cropping and livestock grazing by larger farmers. As a consequence of&#13;
limitations imposed by uncertain climate and market fluctuations, the rural poor in the&#13;
Northeast, comprising small farm owners, tenants, sharecroppers and landless laborers rely&#13;
on a complex of activities including the subsistence cropping of basic foods and small-&#13;
scale animal husbandry, cash crops (mainly cotton and cashew), casual agricultural and&#13;
non-agricultural work, and remnittances from family members living in cities.&#13;
1.5   Health and social indicators attest to the poor quality of life in the Northeast,&#13;
compared to the rest of Brazil. The region has: (a) a rate of chronic malnutrition of&#13;
children under five at 27% and, in the rural areas, 31%, compared to 15% nationwide; (b)&#13;
57% of households without piped water supply, reaching 91% in the rural areas,&#13;
compared to 28% nationwide; (c) 30% of households without electricity, more than&#13;
doubling to 67% in the rural areas, compared to 13% nationwide; and (d) 73% of all&#13;
households and 96% of rural households lacking access to proper sanitation facilities,&#13;
compared to 46% nationwide.2&#13;

1.6   Public investment in the Northeast in basic infrastructure --particularly in&#13;
transport, electrification and water supply-- has declined dramatically in the past 25 years&#13;
because of economic recession and fiscal crisis3. The annual growth rate of public capital&#13;
investment in the region was 9.6% in the period 1970-80, 3.1% in 1980-90, but a mninus&#13;
9.9% in 1990-93. The distribution of public investment between the Federal, State and&#13;
municipal governments, has also evolved significantly since the early 1980s. Comparing&#13;
the period 1970-80 to 1990-93, the contribution of the Federal Government to total&#13;
capital investment expenditure in the Northeast dropped from 58% to 47% while that of&#13;
municipal governments more than doubled from 9% to 19%/0. The State governments'&#13;
share remained practically constant at 33-34%. The proposed project would help&#13;
compensate for the lack of public investment expenditure in the Northeast. The project&#13;
would also reflect the shift in investment expenditure shares from the Federal Government&#13;
to municipal governments by concentrating resource allocation decisions for subproject&#13;
investments at the municipal level and by leveraging resources of municipal governments&#13;
to increase investment in poor rural areas.&#13;
1.7   The proposed project would also be a natural comp:lement to important changes in&#13;
the political economy of Brazil that were brought about by the Constitution of 1988.&#13;
Fiscal resources, priority setting and program implementation responsibilities have been&#13;
increasingly decentralized from the Federal Government to the states, municipalities and&#13;
local populations. This encouraging trend should help avoid many of the financial and&#13;
managerial problems which generations of Northeast poverty programs encountered under&#13;
centralized coordination and implementation arrangements. Much of the Bank's dialogue&#13;
and lending for poverty, including in rural development, health and education, have now&#13;
shifted to the states, with the role of the Federal Government being redefined to stress&#13;
more strategic functions, such as broad policy and norm setting and financial transfer&#13;
schemes to improve equity.&#13;
Experience with Past Bank Leirding&#13;
1.8   The Federal and State Governments have been involved since the early 1970s in&#13;
financing projects to alleviate rural poverty in the Northeast. The World Bank has been&#13;
associated for many years with these efforts, through its financing of a series of programs&#13;
and projects, including area-specific and state rural development projects, various sectoral&#13;
operations and a regional rural development program.&#13;
1.9   Historically, rural development programs in the Northeast have coalesced around&#13;
two themes: drought relief and the integrated development of selected areas. The first&#13;
has involved emergency relief programs or projects to increase the productivity of scarce&#13;
water resources, including large public irrigation schemes. While the budgetary impact of&#13;
these projects has been tremendous, their poverty effects hiave been limited and often&#13;

temporary. The second approach, that of integrated subregional development programs,&#13;
has included initiatives like the Sertanejo Project and the Bank-financed&#13;
POLONORDESTE projects of the 1970s and early 1980s.&#13;
1.10 POLONORDESTE. The POLONORDESTE operations concentrated on&#13;
specific microregions within each of the nine Northeast states and the northern part of&#13;
Minas Gerais. They were comprehensive, multisectoral projects designed to improve&#13;
agricultural efficiency, raise rural incomes and increase employment. They typically&#13;
included components for agricultural modernization (extension, research, credit,&#13;
marketing, land administration), infrastructure (rural water supply, roads and irrigation)&#13;
and social investments (education, health and community development). Many important&#13;
sectoral initiatives were first piloted under the POLONORDESTE projects: farm&#13;
management extension techniques; integrated farm unit research for small-scale&#13;
agriculture, rather than crop-based research; a wide range of land redistribution initiatives&#13;
and modern land titling technologies; educational curriculum and school calendar reforms&#13;
for rural areas; and community-based primary health care schemes.&#13;
1.11  Nevertheless, evaluation of POLONORDESTE by the Bank in the early 1980s&#13;
showed that, in the aggregate, they had only a limited impact on poverty. The micro-&#13;
regions supported by the Bank projects were relatively small areas in the context of the&#13;
whole Northeast; poverty targeting mechanisms were weak; and delivery mechanisms&#13;
relied exclusively on Federal and state bureaucracies. The Federal Government frequently&#13;
failed to provide adequate counterpart funds and delayed the release of budgeted amounts,&#13;
with damaging effects on the projects given Brazil's chronically high inflation.&#13;
Consequently, less than one-third of project funds reached intended beneficiaries, as&#13;
seriously reduced budgets were absorbed by administration and overheads.&#13;
1.12 Sectoral Loans and the Northeast Rural Development Program. These&#13;
considerations prompted the Bank and Federal Government to change strategies in the&#13;
mid-1980s. On the one hand, the lessons learned from some of the pilot efforts under&#13;
POLONORDESTE were promising, but it was felt that these needed to be expanded&#13;
geographically and supported by broader sector policy reforms, within the framework of&#13;
single-sector operations unencumbered by the coordination and implementation difficulties&#13;
of multiple components. A series of sectoral operations, such as Northeast land titling,&#13;
education, health, and irrigation, resulted in the next few years.&#13;
1.13  With respect to integrated rural development, this was still considered to be a&#13;
viable and necessary approach but, again, it was felt that the effort should be expanded&#13;
statewide in order to have a broader impact, and that the number of components should be&#13;
drastically reduced. As a result, in 1985, the Northeast Rural Development Program&#13;
(NRDP) was established to alleviate rural poverty and improve the living standards of&#13;
small farm families in the Northeast. Under this program, the Bank approved during&#13;
1985-87 individual loans for the ten states in an amount totaling US$826.7 million. But,&#13;
through 1993, with the exception of one component supporting small community projects&#13;
(known as the APCR), implementation of the NRDP lagged behind schedule and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
performance in meeting basic objectives was weak. Some of the main causes were quite&#13;
similar to the causes of poor perfornnance under the earlier POLONORDESTE projects:&#13;
chronic fiscal deficits and other macroeconomic distortions led to almost constant&#13;
counterpart funding shortages and widespread deteriorationi of many of the public&#13;
institutions responsible for carrying out the NRDP. The Federal Government devolved&#13;
some responsibilities to the states, but, by and large, institutional arrangements were still&#13;
highly centralized. Decision-making, administration and financing arrangements were&#13;
generally non-participatory, and the sense of project "ownership" at both state and local&#13;
levels was limited.&#13;
1.14 On the other hand, the innovative APCR community-based components (para.&#13;
1.13), which stressed community organization and relied on local planning and&#13;
implementation, were noticeably more successful. They acknowledged the expressed&#13;
needs of the communities, their poverty alleviation impact was positive, the cost per family&#13;
relatively low, and disbursement and commitment rates far exceeded those of other&#13;
components.&#13;
1.15 Reformulated NRDP. On the Bank's initiative, in 1993 the NRDP was&#13;
reformulated and transformed into a community-based development program, drawing&#13;
both on the successful experience of the APCR small comrnunity projects component and&#13;
on lessons learned with similar schemes elsewhere in Latin America, particularly the&#13;
Mexican Solidaridad program. Performance has since improved markedly. Rural&#13;
communities are participating in the identification, financing and implementation of&#13;
subprojects that meet their most pressing needs, increase their sense of project ownership,&#13;
and have a much sharper focus on poverty alleviation. The reformulated NRDP is&#13;
covering all members of poor rural communities and not only those with productive assets,&#13;
extending beyond production and income, and based on a 'matching grant" mechanism&#13;
linked to beneficiary contributions towards subproject cosl;. The State Governments are&#13;
fully responsible for counterpart funding, and the corresponding sense of "ownership" of&#13;
the program has also improved.&#13;
1.16  Based on implementation in the almost three years since reformulation, as well as&#13;
the earlier experience of the APCR components, certain facts are now clear. The program&#13;
has generated unprecedented enthusiasm among beneficiaries and favorable multiplier&#13;
effects--with replicability evident in other programs--and has mobilized additional funds&#13;
from municipalities and communities. As much as 93% of disbursements are reaching&#13;
targeted beneficiaries, and diversion of funds for non-intended uses has been sharply&#13;
reduced. The NRDP's participatory approach has induced greater community&#13;
organization and empowerment, increased transparency, and demonstrated that rural&#13;
communities can influence the allocation and use of resources at the municipal level to&#13;
alleviate poverty. Investments ifnded by the program have been of satisfactory quality&#13;
and less costly than those executed by public agencies. While the reformulated program&#13;
was not expected to change the basic agricultural economy in the Northeast, it has&#13;
successfully reached a large number of landless families and land reform beneficiaries.&#13;
Several field investigations, surveys and studies have assessed the impact of NRDP. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
consensus, from a broad sample of completed and operational subprojects, is that they&#13;
have had a positive impact on the quality of life, and in the case of productive subprojects,&#13;
on employment and incomes of beneficiaries. In so doing, the NRDP has initiated a&#13;
process of local accumulation and, albeit still on a small scale, elevated the socio-&#13;
economic standards of beneficiary communities that will progressively allow them to enter&#13;
formal market channels. Additionally, the program, by providing essential infrastructure&#13;
and social services to these communities, has relieved some of the budgetary burden of the&#13;
Northeast states and municipalities. A summary evaluation of the reformulated NRDP is&#13;
provided in Annex B.&#13;
The State of Pernambuco&#13;
1.17 The State of Pernambuco covers a territory of 98,300 km2 whose long east/west&#13;
and narrow north/south configuration incorporates a range of agro-climatic regions and&#13;
micro-regions which have molded its socio-economic and productive patterns of&#13;
development. The state is divided into three major regions: the Mata Atldntica represents&#13;
10% of state territory, has an abundant rainfall of up to 2,000 mm per year, fertile soils&#13;
and is the main crop-growing region; the Agreste covers 20% of the state, and has rainfall&#13;
of 650 to 900 mm per year with a dry period of up to seven months; and, the Sertdo,&#13;
which makes up 70% of the state and has an annual rainfall below 500 mm and irregular&#13;
dry periods of up to ten months. Some 90% of the state is within the semi-arid "drought&#13;
polygon" characterized by severe, cyclical and often protracted drought.&#13;
1.18  Certain indicators illustrate the socioeconomic predicament of Pemambuco's 7.1&#13;
million inhabitants: (i) 50% of heads of households (73% in rural areas) have a monthly&#13;
income less than or equivalent to one minimum wage (currently about US$112); and (ii)&#13;
illiteracy affects 25% of the total population and 59% of the rural population (1991).&#13;
About one-third of Pemambuco's population lives in rural areas, where access to basic&#13;
infrastructure and services is grossly inadequate: 72% of rural households lack access to&#13;
proper sanitation facilities, and 92% have inadequate access to safe water (1991).&#13;
1.19  As in the rest of the Northeast, poverty in Pemambuco is closely correlated with&#13;
geography. The rural poor are primarily smallholders, sharecroppers and wage workers,&#13;
who depend on a diverse strategy of income-generating activities in which the subsistence&#13;
production of maize, beans, manioc and rice, and small livestock predomninates. Their&#13;
well-being fluctuates with changes in the agro-climatic conditions. In the semi-arid and&#13;
transition zones, rainfall is scarce and highly irregular, yielding crops of low quality and&#13;
income-generating capacity. In addition to the lack of reliable water supply, these small&#13;
farmers lack modem production technology and basic infrastructure to store harvests to&#13;
take advantage of cyclical price fluctuations. Consequently, family income is highly&#13;
variable, and there is little opportunity for savings.&#13;
1.20 State Government Strategy to Alleviate Poverty. The State Government of&#13;
Pemambuco is concerned with the socio-economic conditions of its rural population,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
particularly in the semi-arid region. The Government's strategy is to address poverty&#13;
through increased employment and income, social organization, education, natural&#13;
resource conservation and greater participation of small, marginalized communities in the&#13;
identification of their priorities and the delivery of services. The State Government is&#13;
mindful of the lessons from the NRDP which stress decentralization and local&#13;
development. The Government is stimulating local economies through support for micro-&#13;
enterprise development, including small family farms, and small-scale agro-processing and&#13;
manufacturing which also create employment. It also supports the development of&#13;
cooperatives, the work of NGOs in organizing community-based productive ventures and&#13;
in facilitating access to credit and technology, and aims to provide poor populations with&#13;
the physical infrastructure and services necessary to improve the quality of life and&#13;
generate income and employment opportunities.&#13;
1.21  Experience with Previous Bank Rural Development Projects in Pernambuco.&#13;
The State of Pernambuco has undertaken two Bank-financed rural development projects&#13;
since 1979 under POLONORDESTE and the NRDP, as well as other rural poverty&#13;
projects such as TERRA NOSSA, focusing on land reform. Pernambuco's performance&#13;
under Bank-financed projects prior to the 1993 NRDP reformulation was generally&#13;
consistent with the integrated rural development and NRDP project experience of other&#13;
Northeastern states (paras. 1.8 to 1.16).&#13;
1.22  The NRDP-Pernambuco project closed on June 30, 1996, after a six-month&#13;
extension of the original closing date. Under the reformulated NRDP, Pernambuco's&#13;
performance was initially poor but, thanks to the efforts and commitment of the current&#13;
State Government, greatly improved in the past year and a half After reformulation,&#13;
US$19.5 million were disbursed and US$3.2 million committed which, together with the&#13;
cancellation of US$20 million in December 1994, left a balance of only US$0.8 million.&#13;
The annual rate of disbursements after reformulation topped US$9 million, pushed&#13;
forward by a US$1 million per month disbursement rate in 1996. By closing, rural&#13;
community associations had submitted some 4,159 subproject applications, of which 1,237&#13;
were financed and/or completed. 55% of the approved investments were infrastructure&#13;
subprojects, 37% were productive and 8% were social subprojects.&#13;
Main Lessons Learned from the Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP)&#13;
1.23  The World Bank has 20 years of experience in supporting rural development and&#13;
poverty alleviation in Northeast Brazil, starting with the POLONORDESTE Program&#13;
(1975-84), a variety of sectoral projects and more recently with the NRDP (1985 to the&#13;
present). The NRDP, following its reformulation in 1993, has focused entirely on client-&#13;
driven subproject investments implemented by the comnmurdties themselves, with&#13;
decentralized project management at the state and municipal levels and more transparent&#13;
decision-making and accountability for project performance. Implementation has provided&#13;
important lessons for the proposed project (see Annex B for further details):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
(a)   Decentralization of fiscal and investment decision-making from Federal to&#13;
state and local governments ensures more efficient project administration.&#13;
Decentralization of resource allocation and investment decisions to&#13;
municipalities and communities should be accompanied by a clearly defined&#13;
and well-disseminated system of incentives and penalties to discourage the&#13;
misuse of funds;&#13;
(b)   Poverty-targeting mechanisms should be simple, explicit and&#13;
monitorable; be based on objective criteria; foster transparency and&#13;
minimize political interference in project resource allocation; and ensure&#13;
that project resources do reach the poorest communities;&#13;
(c)   Participation in the financing of subprojects generates a sense of&#13;
ownership and a willingness to share responsibility for the future operation&#13;
and maintenance of project investments. Beneficiary participation in the&#13;
selection, execution, supervision and financing of project investments&#13;
ensures that investments respond to true, perceived needs, generates cost&#13;
savings and increases accountability at the local level; the organization of&#13;
poor communities heightens their awareness of available programs and&#13;
services, facilitates their participation and increases subproject cost-&#13;
effectiveness;&#13;
(d)   Sustainability of project investments has greater potential wvhen the&#13;
municipalities and communities contribute to subproject financing in a cost-&#13;
sharing arrangement and when there is increased beneficiary participation.&#13;
For example, the participatory process introduced in the pilot Municipal&#13;
Council component (FUMAC) of the reformulated NRDP ensured better&#13;
selection and prioritization of subprojects by beneficiaries. Sustainability is&#13;
also promoted when communities themselves assume greater&#13;
responsibilities and continue to voice their demands in a concrete fashion to&#13;
influence public investment expenditure at the local level;&#13;
(e)    A widely disseminated and carefully designed publicity campaign is&#13;
essential to ensure transparency and proper knowledge of the program's&#13;
objectives and contents by all potential beneficiaries;&#13;
(f)    Technical assistance should be accessible to rural communities to enable&#13;
them to identify, prepare and implement their own subprojects, thereby&#13;
augmenting their capacity to compete for investment funds. Technical&#13;
assistance should also be targeted to weaker municipalities to improve their&#13;
planning, management and financial capacity; and, the quality of the Project&#13;
Coordinating Unit (PCU), whether it provides technical assistance directly&#13;
or through partner entities, is a critical factor in project success and may&#13;
entail the contracting of local and/or international organizations to&#13;
strengthen its institutional capacities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
(g)   Standardization of subproject documents, technical designs and unit&#13;
costs simplifies the subproject preparation and evaluation process,&#13;
facilitates the procurement of goods and works, prevents overdesign and&#13;
improves the quality of subprojects, thereby encouraging greater&#13;
participation by poorer communities and reducing bottlenecks in the&#13;
subproject cycle;&#13;
(h)   Supervision, both during and after subproject implementation, is an&#13;
indispensable determinant of success and sustainability. It has to be&#13;
reinforced at all levels and involve local entiities closest to the communities,&#13;
particularly Municipal Councils and NGOs; and&#13;
(i)    A user-friendly monitoring and evaluation system facilitates the&#13;
subproject evaluation process, provides feedback and necessary&#13;
information to improve targeting and efficiency, and is an essential&#13;
management and planning tool.&#13;
1.24 The design of the proposed Pernambuco Rural Poverty Alleviation Project has&#13;
taken into account these lessons, which are consistent in rnany respects with lessons&#13;
learned elsewhere in Latin America and other regions with similar community-based&#13;
development programs. The project will expand the FUMAC approach and initiate a pilot&#13;
municipal funds program (para. 2.7), to promote decentralization of decision-making and&#13;
resource allocation to municipal and community levels, to relieve the administrative logjam&#13;
resulting from state intervention in the minutiae of subprojects, and to further encourage&#13;
municipal cost-sharing of subprojects. The project will employ a poverty targeting&#13;
methodology based on a series of poverty-related criteria at the municipal, community and&#13;
beneficiary levels, and backed by a strong system of operational checks and balances to&#13;
thwart mistargeting and misappropriation of resources. As a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness, an improved monitoring and evaluation system will be adopted to reinforce&#13;
the targeting mechanism and to strengthen the management of the subproject cycle (paras.&#13;
2.31-2.40). Equally important, for simplicity and efficiency in subproject preparation,&#13;
evaluation and supervision, the Project Operational Manual will establish standard&#13;
subproject designs, technical and financial parameters, and cost indicators for the most&#13;
frequently requested subprojects. In addition, funds for technical assistance to rural&#13;
communities and municipalities will be facilitated, to actively promote the organization of&#13;
the poorest areas to enable their participation, foster comnunity capacity and&#13;
empowerment, and encourage the active participation of NGOs and local grassroots&#13;
organizations. Finally, the additional resources (and a larger share of Bank financing) will&#13;
be allocated specifically to supervision by the PCU and local entities, that would not only&#13;
secure the quality of project investments but also ensure that implementation bottlenecks,&#13;
if any, are quickly resolved so as to allow smooth and successful operation of the&#13;
subprojects.&#13;

2.   THE PROJECT&#13;
Origin and Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.1   The proposed project is based on the positive results of the reformulated Northeast&#13;
Rural Development Program (NRDP). Evaluation by the Brazilian Government, FAO/CP&#13;
and the World Bank has confirmed that the reformulated NRDP, itself the culmination of&#13;
two decades of experience, has succeeded in introducing an effective model for rural&#13;
poverty alleviation in the Northeast. This model has now been field-tested for about three&#13;
years, and the Northeast State Governments are developing projects which would expand&#13;
its coverage. The proposed project in Pernambuco would be one of the second group of&#13;
follow-on operations, succeeding the Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects for Bahia, Ceara&#13;
and Sergipe, which were approved by the Board on June 29, 1995.&#13;
2.2   The Brazilian administration is preoccupied with the level of poverty nationwide,&#13;
but particularly in the Northeast and its rural areas, and has declared the Northeast a&#13;
priority for public development programs. The cornerstone of the Federal Government's&#13;
effort to combat poverty and hunger in Brazil is the Comunidade Solid6iria program&#13;
launched in early 1995, a broad framework for the coordination of rural and urban poverty&#13;
programs and projects, focusing on municipalities where poverty is most severe.&#13;
Implementation is decentralized, stressing community self-help and local empowerment,&#13;
and concentrating on four main themes: rural development, income and employment&#13;
generation, food and nutrition -- which has tended to receive most of the focus in the early&#13;
stages -- and urban services. The proposed Pernambuco Rural Poverty Alleviation Project&#13;
is fully consistent with this strategy, parts of which draw heavily on the Bank-supported&#13;
NRDP experience in Northeast Brazil (paras. 1.12-1.16).&#13;
2.3   The project is also fully supportive of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) for Brazil, discussed by the Board on June 29, 1995, and updated in the CAS&#13;
Progress Report discussed by the Board on June 20, 1996. The CAS identifies poverty&#13;
reduction as the central objective of the Bank's assistance efforts in Brazil, and recognizes&#13;
that policy dialogue and lending should be directed to the states, given their fundamental&#13;
role in the provision of infrastructure and social services. The CAS recommends specific&#13;
anti-poverty policies, particularly through the expansion of ongoing efforts to decentralize&#13;
and shift expenditure and implementation responsibilities from the Federal Government to&#13;
the States, municipalities and local communities. The proposed project is an important&#13;
factor in meeting the Bank's main objective in Brazil. As the principal donor engaged in a&#13;
sustained, long-term partnership with the Brazilian Government to address rural poverty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
issues in the Northeast, the Bank is particularly well placed to support this next phase of&#13;
development initiatives for Pernambuco.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
2.4   The project would assist the State Government of Pernambuco to alleviate rural&#13;
poverty and its consequences by: (a) providing basic social and economic infrastructure,&#13;
and employment and income-generating opportunities for the rural poor; (b) decentralizing&#13;
resource allocation and decision-making to local levels by supporting community-based&#13;
municipal councils and beneficiary associations in investmenl: planning and&#13;
implementation; (c) providing a safety net for the rural poor during a period of&#13;
macroeconomic reform and fiscal adjustment; and (d) leveraging resources mobilized at&#13;
the community and municipal levels. The project is expected to lay groundwork for, and&#13;
consolidate, participatory institutions and processes at the municipal and community&#13;
levels. The project would ensure that funds reach the poorest municipalities and&#13;
communities, and would expand the successful strategy of decentralization and&#13;
participation tested under the reformulated NRDP.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
2.5   The proposed project would include three main components, as follows:&#13;
(a) Community Subprojects (US$46.2 million or 90% of total base cost), which would&#13;
support small-scale investments selected and subsequently operated and maintained by the&#13;
beneficiaries themselves; (b) Institutional Development (US$2.6 million or 5% of total&#13;
base cost), which would provide all implementing entities and communities with technical&#13;
assistance and training to increase their capacity and improve implementation of the&#13;
project; and (c) Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.6&#13;
million or 5% of total base cost), which would finance project coordination and activities&#13;
to provide feedback on project performance and impact.&#13;
A. Community Subprojects&#13;
2.6   The project would provide grants to rural community associations to finance small-&#13;
scale subprojects (up to US$50,000 each) identified by these groups as priority&#13;
investments that would improve community well-being. Subprojects would be of many&#13;
types, broadly classified as infrastructure (such as rural water supply, electrification, local&#13;
road improvements, and small bridges), social (e.g., day care centers, school or health post&#13;
rehabilitation) and productive subprojects (such as small-scale community agro-&#13;
processing, communal tractors and minor irrigation schemes). Subproject selection is&#13;
demand-driven and based on community preferences. The project would establish a&#13;
negative list of subproject types ineligible for financing and, for productive subprojects in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
particular, additional and rigorous eligibility criteria4. Subproject proposals would observe&#13;
standard documentation and technical, economic, environmental and sustainability criteria&#13;
established in a detailed Project Operational Manual, which sets forth procedures and&#13;
guidelines for implementation. The Operational Manual, based on the manual already in&#13;
use for the reformulated NRDP project, will reflect the lessons learned during the past&#13;
three years of implementation. During appraisal, agreements were reached on the needed&#13;
improvements to the NRDP Operational Manual. During negotiations, the Bank reviewed&#13;
a complete revised draft of the Operational Manual, and assurances were provided by the&#13;
Borrower that all project components and subprojects would be executed in accordance&#13;
with the Operational Manual (para. 3.1 (a)). Adoption of the Operational Manual would&#13;
be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 3.2(a)).&#13;
2.7    The identification, preparation and implementation of all subprojects financed&#13;
under the project will be the responsibility of the beneficiary rural communities (see paras.&#13;
2.31 to 2.40 for a detailed description of the community subproject cycle). Three different&#13;
delivery mechanisms will distinguish how the subprojects are approved and the respective&#13;
financing arranged:&#13;
(a)    State Community Schemes (PAC). PAC was the original subprojects&#13;
component of the reformulated NRDP. Under PAC, rural. communities&#13;
submit their subproject investment proposals directly to the State Project&#13;
Coordinating Unit (PCU). The PCU screens, approves and releases funds&#13;
for subprojects, interacting directly with the beneficiary communities. It is&#13;
expected that up to US$12.9 million equivalent, or 25% of total base costs,&#13;
would be invested under this subcomponent over the four-year project&#13;
implementation period;&#13;
(b)    Municipal Community Schemes (FUMAC). FUMAC was tested and&#13;
proven successful under the reformulated NRDP. In FUMAC, decision-&#13;
making on subproject approval is delegated by the State to project&#13;
Municipal Councils, composed of community members and representatives&#13;
of civil society and municipal authorities. The Municipal Councils&#13;
prioritize the demands presented by rural communities through local&#13;
consensus-building and approve subprojects, within an indicative annual&#13;
budget, for financing by the PCU. The selection process would be the&#13;
basis of targeting in the project since the communities themselves, through&#13;
their participation in the project Municipal Councils, determnine where&#13;
project resources can best be applied based on their first-hand knowledge&#13;
4   Eligible productive subprojects would be those which provide services which benefit a large number&#13;
of conununity members and for which a fee is charged for operation and maintenance. Productive&#13;
subprojects, as with infrastructure and social subprojects, must be property of the association as a&#13;
whole and not of select members. For each type of productive subproject, a set of operational&#13;
guidelines (regulamento de uso), developed by the PCU, would be provided to the association and&#13;
must be adopted. In addition, each subproject proposal must identify the source of technical&#13;
assistance for subproject implementation and subsequent operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
of local investment needs. It is expected that at least US$29.3 million&#13;
equivalent, or 57% of total base costs, would be invested under this&#13;
subcomponent.&#13;
(c)   Pilot Municipal Community Funds (FUMAC-P). This new&#13;
subcomponent would be a pilot variant of FIJMAC, in which selected&#13;
Municipal Councils would prioritize and approve subprojects submitted by&#13;
rural communities and then would finance them within the context of an&#13;
annual budget, which the State PCU would clelegate to the Municipal&#13;
Councils to manage themselves. This annual budget envelope would be&#13;
allocated to the Municipal Councils according to a distribution formula,&#13;
based on clear and measurable criteria, such -as rural population and&#13;
previous year's performance, for implementation of an Annual Operating&#13;
Plan (POA) prepared by each Municipal Council and approved by the&#13;
PCU. The Municipal Council would transfer funds to beneficiary&#13;
associations to finance approved community subprojects. It is expected&#13;
that at least US$4.0 million equivalent, or 8%No of total base costs, would be&#13;
invested under this subcomponent.&#13;
2.8   Each subcomponent represents a greater degree of decentralization of decision-&#13;
making and resource allocation responsibilities. Moving from PAC to FUMAC to&#13;
FUMAC-P, the control over project investment planning becomes increasingly local and&#13;
rural communities gain greater voice through their representation on the Municipal&#13;
Council as well as through their participation in its decisions. This institutionalization of&#13;
the participatory process would protect it from political fluctuation, and would eventually&#13;
lead to stronger partnerships between communities and Municipal Councils and their&#13;
respective municipal governments in determining the use of public resources.&#13;
2.9   Given the overwhelmingly positive response to FUMAC under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP, it is expected that the need for the PAC subcomponent would diminish over the&#13;
course of project implementation, with the FUMAC and FUMAC-P subcomponents&#13;
gradually expanding. The continued existence of PAC would facilitate participation in the&#13;
project of those communities within municipalities which lack either the capacity or the&#13;
political will to adopt the FUMAC or FUMAC-P approach. When a municipality is well&#13;
organized and receptive to participatory decision-making processes, it enters FUMAC, a&#13;
Municipal Council is formed and resource allocation decisions are made at the local level.5&#13;
Once the Municipal Council demonstrates effectiveness in prioritization of demands and&#13;
subproject supervision and a capacity to manage resources, the municipality is promoted&#13;
from FUMAC to FUMAC-P, and henceforth the actual resources are administered at the&#13;
local level by the Municipal Council based on locally-determined investment planning.&#13;
5  Under the reformulated NRDP in Pernambuco, 15 FUMAC Municipal Councils were formed. These&#13;
Councils will continue as FUMAC Councils under the proposed project or may be upgraded to&#13;
FUMAC-P Councils.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Flexibility would be built into the project to reallocate funds among subcomponents to&#13;
accommodate the expansion of FUMAC and FUMAC-P.&#13;
2.10  In compliance with Brazilian law, beneficiaries must form legally-constituted civil&#13;
associations in order to be eligible to receive financing under the project. Disbursements&#13;
to the beneficiary associations would occur through agreements (convenios) with the PCU&#13;
and/or project Municipal Councils. During appraisal, understandings were reached on&#13;
draft model agreements between the PCU, Municipal Councils and community&#13;
associations for the implementation of community subprojects under the FUMAC,&#13;
FUMAC-P and PAC subcomponents. The final model agreements would form part of the&#13;
Project Operational Manual. Beneficiary associations would contribute to subproject&#13;
costs, either in cash, kind or labor, and would be responsible for the operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) of the investments. The minimum level of contributions expected&#13;
from the beneficiaries, municipalities and the State Government would be specified in a&#13;
cost-sharing matrix in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
B. Institutional Development&#13;
2.11   The Institutional Development component (US$2.6 million or 5% of base costs)&#13;
will finance appropriate technical assistance and training in order for each group&#13;
participating in project implementation to acquire the capabilities needed to effectively&#13;
carry out its responsibilities (see Annex D). The project is expected to lay the&#13;
groundwork for, and consolidate, participatory institutions and processes at the municipal&#13;
and community levels through the community subproject approach, described above, in&#13;
which well-organized communities with sound, carefully prepared proposals are provided&#13;
with financial support for investments, and in which FUMAC Municipal Councils which&#13;
demonstrate effective decision-making capacity are promoted to FUMAC-.P and rewarded&#13;
with their own investment budget.&#13;
2.12  To encourage this process and to accompany the decentralized implementation&#13;
framework of the project, technical assistance and training would be provided for the&#13;
beneficiary associations, Municipal Councils, and the PCU, as well as other participating&#13;
entities (Annex E). For example, to derive optimal benefits from subproject investments,&#13;
the beneficiary associations will need accessible support for community organization and&#13;
subproject preparation and execution, as well as for training in operation and maintenance&#13;
techniques. The project Municipal Councils will require assistance to orient their decision-&#13;
making on resource allocation among community investments and, in the FUMAC-P pilot&#13;
program, to create capacity for investment planning and financial administration. In&#13;
addition to providing or making available from other sources a wide range of technical and&#13;
managerial advice to the project Municipal Councils and beneficiary associations, the PCU&#13;
will need training to enhance its own project coordination and supervision skills. Also,&#13;
because the fiscal situation of the State affects both project implementation and state&#13;
counterpart funding, technical assistance at the state level is needed to analyze issues&#13;
surrounding the reform of the State and to identify measures to improve the State's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
.capacity to address the inherent causes of its fiscal deficit situation. The instruments for&#13;
achieving this capacity building would include a combination of workshops, technical&#13;
exchanges, on-site training, and more traditional technical assistance, drawing upon local&#13;
expertise within the state --local extensionists, technical consultants, universities, NGOs,&#13;
and other local service providers-- as well as national and international technical assistance&#13;
agencies. To this effect, the component would finance consultant services, training&#13;
materials and courses, seminars, workshops, and related operational costs.&#13;
2.13   The implementation of the institutional development component would be&#13;
decentralized, and the provision of and accountability for technical assistance and training&#13;
would occur increasingly at the local level. In particular, prcject Municipal Councils will&#13;
play a critical role in overseeing the capacity-building activities for community associations&#13;
in their jurisdictions. Municipal Councils, provided with model terms of reference&#13;
prepared by the PCU, would contract technical assistance based on programs agreed with&#13;
the PCU, which would then release funds for that purpose. Institutional development&#13;
activities can be broadly categorized into five areas: (a) mobilization assistance and&#13;
training for participating communities. Organized and contracted by the PCU and&#13;
Municipal Councils, assistance would be provided for the organization and strengthening&#13;
of community associations, identification of viable investments, subproject preparation,&#13;
and operation and maintenance of investments; (b) capacity-building programs for&#13;
Municipal Councils. Organized by the PCU, the programs would include intensive&#13;
training on the role of Municipal Councils, guidelines of the Operational Manual,&#13;
subproject evaluation and supervision and related topics such as environmental assessment&#13;
of subprojects for each Municipal Council under the project, as well as participatory&#13;
planning and financial management training for FUMAC-P Councils; (c) specialized skills&#13;
training for all participating entities. Based on needs, expert advice and "on-the-job&#13;
training" by local providers would be contracted by the PCU, Municipal Councils and&#13;
groups of community associations, in areas such as the use of standard designs,&#13;
monitoring techniques, and financial administration as well as technical support (e.g., for&#13;
groups of community associations on water use); (d) technical assistance for State reform.&#13;
The Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN), through the PCU, will have access to technical&#13;
assistance funds (US$0.6 million or 1% of base costs) for co:nsultant services and studies&#13;
required for administrative and other state reforms. During appraisal, agreements were&#13;
reached with the State on the content and implementation arrangements for this Technical&#13;
Assistance subcomponent; and (e) workshops and seminars for the Municipal Councils&#13;
and beneficiary associations, to exchange experience under the project. These "best&#13;
practice" exchanges could also extend to seminars joining all PCUs of the ten&#13;
Northeastern states to disseminate successful experiences across states.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
C. Project Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
2.14 This component (US$2.6 million, or 5% of total base costs) would support overall&#13;
project coordination and supervision and would help to strengthen the effectiveness and&#13;
quality of project operations. It would finance the incremental operating costs of the&#13;
PCU, for overall coordination of project activities, and a statewide information campaign&#13;
to disseminate information about the project and its guidelines to all potential beneficiary&#13;
communities, to increase awareness, transparency and participation. For this campaign,&#13;
the project would finance: (a) local technical assistance in the design and development of&#13;
the campaign; and (b) the implementation costs, including posters, leaflets, radio spots and&#13;
videos. The preparation of a statewide information campaign. acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 3.2(b)).&#13;
2.15  Given the importance of supervision to the overall impact of the program, project&#13;
supervision (Annex J) will be intensified under the project and, accordingly, will be&#13;
allocated half of the component's resources (US$1.3 million, or about 3% of base costs).&#13;
Project supervision will provide the PCU with the necessary information on project&#13;
performance to make managerial decisions, such as the provision of technical assistance or&#13;
training, the correction of departures from project guidelines, and the promotion of project&#13;
municipalities from FUMAC to FUMAC-P. In line with the decentralized implementation&#13;
of the project, the responsibilities for project supervision at the state and local levels will&#13;
correspond to the PCU and the project Municipal Councils, respectively. Supervision&#13;
activities to be financed under the project include operational expenses for field visits and&#13;
subcontracted services from NGOs and other participating agencies.&#13;
2.16  This component would also finance the establishment of a monitoring system,&#13;
including the maintenance and use of a Management Information System (MIS). To&#13;
function as an efficient management tool, the project MIS (Annex H), originally designed&#13;
under the NRDP, would be improved and made more user-friendly and performance-&#13;
oriented. It would contain key technical, financial and socio-economic information on&#13;
subprojects, as well as cost and other physical indicators. MIS-generated project reports,&#13;
including monthly disbursement reports and semi-annual progress reports, would facilitate&#13;
subproject tracking and generate appropriate feedback on project performance. Project&#13;
performance and impact indicators would be regularly updated to take stock of project&#13;
implementation and included in the semi-annual progress reports. A Project&#13;
Implementation Plan and a matrix of Project Performance Indicators were finalized and&#13;
agreed at appraisal. In addition to financing operating costs for monitoring activities, the&#13;
project would finance experts in information technology and project management: (i) to&#13;
improve the MIS; and (ii) to collect and analyze data on cost indicators and physical&#13;
parameters from the most frequently approved types of subprojects, so as to calculate a&#13;
range of values for these indicators and to adjust subproject eligibility criteria accordingly.&#13;
These adjustments would then be incorporated into the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
2.17  Finally, the project would finance consultant services to develop and implement&#13;
studies to evaluate the impact of the subprojects and provide feedback to improve project&#13;
operations: (a) annual physical performance reviews, to assess the quality and&#13;
sustainability of common types of subprojects financed by the project, including reviews of&#13;
community-based procurement; (b) an implementation review, carried out at the mid-term&#13;
of project implementation, which would include beneficiary consultations to generate an&#13;
evaluation of project performance and impact as perceived by the ultimate beneficiaries;&#13;
and (c) a comprehensive impact evaluation, which would include a baseline evaluation to&#13;
establish indicators of socio-economic impact and a final evaluation of the project using&#13;
these indicators. Annex H contains a detailed description of the studies to be financed&#13;
under the project.&#13;
2.18  During negotiations, assurances were provided by the Borrower that: a project&#13;
information and monitoring system, with reports and format agreed with the Bank, would&#13;
be maintained throughout the project period. The Bank would receive monthly&#13;
information on disbursements of project funds and semi-annual reports on subproject&#13;
activities and performance of project investments on July 31 and January 31 of each year&#13;
(para. 3.1(b)); a baseline impact evaluation study would be completed within one year of&#13;
loan effectiveness, a mid-term review would be carried out at the end of the second year&#13;
of the project, and a full impact evaluation would be executed at project completion&#13;
(para. 3.1(b)). The establishment, by the State. of effective project monitoring and&#13;
evaluation arrangements would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 3.2 (c)).&#13;
Project Implementation Arrangements&#13;
2.19  Project Coordinating Unit. The Secretariat of Planning (Secretaria do&#13;
Planejamento - SEPLAN) of the State of Pernambuco would implement the project&#13;
through the PCU, represented by PRORURAL, which is the focal point for project&#13;
administration and for communication with the Bank and the State Government.&#13;
PRORURAL is the project's principal liaison for the Municipal Councils and for those&#13;
community associations located in PAC municipalities. Under the proposed project,&#13;
PRORURAL will shed some of the executive responsibilities, that it held under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP, delegating these to Municipal Councils and other participating&#13;
entities at the local level, and will concentrate on its monitoring, technical assistance and&#13;
supervision responsibilities.&#13;
2.20 PRORURAL boasts over a decade of experience in rural development, having&#13;
headed the POLONORDESTE and NRDP projects as Technical Unit. Currently, to&#13;
strengthen its field presence PRORURAL is in the process of restructuring and will&#13;
establish ten regional offices, each with three or more technical staff, in function of the&#13;
demand presented, in addition to its headquarters in Recife. This increased field presence&#13;
reflects the TU's focus on monitoring and supervision and will provide needed additional&#13;
support to Municipal Councils. Under this new structure, the Supervisor and three&#13;
Department Directors (Planning, Operations, and Administration and Finance) would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
supported by 8 section chiefs and about 80 professional staff, of which at least 30 would&#13;
be in the field, and corresponding administrative staff.&#13;
2.21  PRORURAL's principal tasks under the project would include: (i) project planning&#13;
and coordination at the state level through the preparation of POAs, including the&#13;
consolidation of POAs by FUMAC-P Councils, and monitoring activities through&#13;
maintenance of the project's MIS; (ii) promoting the project and encouraging participation&#13;
of potential beneficiary communities, NGOs and private sector entities; (iii) preparing&#13;
project implementation reports and organizing evaluation exercises; (iv) ensuring timely&#13;
and adequate provision of loan and state counterpart funds; (v) appraising and approving&#13;
all PAC subproject proposals; (vi) entering into subproject agreements with community&#13;
associations (PAC) and Municipal Councils (FUMAC) and into POA-based agreements&#13;
with FUMAC-P Municipal Councils, to transfer subproject funds and monitor their use;&#13;
(vii) overseeing all monitoring and supervision activities under the project to ensure&#13;
compliance with project guidelines and to improve the quality of subprojects and project&#13;
interventions; (viii) ensuring that environmental guidelines for subproject approval and&#13;
implementation are followed; (ix) providing technical assistance to the FUMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P Municipal Councils; (x) preparing statements of expenditure (SOEs) and&#13;
applications for reimbursement; and (xi) ensuring that procurement, disbursement and&#13;
auditing procedures applicable to the Bank loan are followed.&#13;
2.22  Assurances were provided by the State of Pernambuco at negotiations that&#13;
proposed POAs and budgets satisfactory to the Bank would be furnished to the Bank in&#13;
October of each year; that the Bank would receive a copy of the final plan and budget as&#13;
soon as they are approved by the Borrower's Legislative Assembly; and that adequate&#13;
counterpart funding would be made available for the project in a timely manner by the&#13;
State (para. 3.1 (c)). Approval of targets for any given year will be contingent upon&#13;
performance in the previous year, including a thorough analysis of the actual demand from&#13;
communities, of subproject costs actually observed, and of the number of uncompleted&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
2.23  Project Municipal Councils. Municipal Councils are the key entity for the&#13;
targeting of project benefits and the allocation of resources under the proposed project.&#13;
By their nature as open and representative bodies which build consensus on priorities, the&#13;
project Municipal Councils instill transparency into the decision-making process for&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P investments. The Councils would comprise representatives&#13;
from: (a) rural communities, civil groups and organizations such as NGOs, religious&#13;
organizations and rural labor unions; and (b) publicly-elected representatives and&#13;
municipal government officials. While the composition of these Councils may vary from&#13;
one municipality to another, representatives from rural communities and civil society&#13;
would make up at least 80% of the Councils' membership. PRORURAL would participate&#13;
in the Councils in an advisory capacity.&#13;
2.24  The Councils would receive, prioritize and approve subproject proposals from the&#13;
beneficiary associations during regularly scheduled meetings which are widely publicized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
and which the public is encouraged to attend. The Councils would deliberate and&#13;
prioritize the subproject proposals presented according to their determination of the needs&#13;
of the different communities, based on criteria such as the level of poverty and the existing&#13;
infrastructure of each community in relation to the rest of the municipality, the type of&#13;
subproject to be financed and its potential to improve the quality of life of the beneficiary&#13;
population; and the demonstrated participation of the beneficiary community in the&#13;
identification of the subproject and its commitment to the operation and maintenance of&#13;
the subproject. Decisions to approve subprojects would be raade by majority of votes and&#13;
based on pre-established technical criteria and/or standard designs. Detailed criteria, rules&#13;
and procedures for the Municipal Councils' structure and operations are included in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.25  The Municipal Councils would be entrusted with the following responsibilities: (a)&#13;
promoting the project in their areas; (b) facilitating assistance to the communities for&#13;
organizational strengthening and subproject preparation and execution; (c) prioritizing,&#13;
through local consensus-building, community subproject proposals and reviewing them for&#13;
approval or rejection; and (d) monitoring and supervising the implementation of approved&#13;
subprojects. Under FUMAC, the Municipal Councils will present subprojects which they&#13;
have approved to PRORURAL for financing; under FUMAC-P, the Councils will&#13;
themselves be responsible for managing the funds allocated to them and signing the&#13;
subproject agreements with the respective beneficiary associations (Annex F). Under&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P, the Municipal Councils foster partnerships among the&#13;
community associations, the municipal governments and the State Government to share&#13;
the costs of the subprojects and therefore leverage the loan fimds to finance increased&#13;
numbers of subprojects.&#13;
2.26  Community Associations. Community associations are the foundation of project&#13;
implementation. These associations are responsible for formulating ideas for subprojects&#13;
and submitting these proposals to the Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-&#13;
P) or PRORURAL (under PAC) for approval. Once a subprcject has been approved, the&#13;
community association enters into a legally binding agreement with PRORURAL and/or&#13;
Municipal Council through which the funds to implement the subproject are passed to the&#13;
association. The association is responsible for all procurement6 and record-keeping during&#13;
the implementation of the subproject, as was practiced successfully in the reformulated&#13;
NRDP. Beneficiary associations contribute to subproject costs, either in cash, kind or&#13;
labor, and are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the investments.&#13;
Project Technical Assistance and Training Arrangements&#13;
2.27  Technical assistance and training to beneficiaries is an indispensable input to&#13;
successful and sustainable subproject investments. Technical assistance and training&#13;
would be provided to beneficiary communities via two mechanisms (see Annex E): (a) the&#13;
6  Beneficiary associations may request assistance from the PCU for procurement under subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
institutional development component (paras. 2.11-2.13); and (b) a percentage of&#13;
subproject costs targeted to technical assistance. The Institutional Development&#13;
component provides flexibility and is not tied to any particular subproject(s), so that&#13;
communities can receive assistance even prior to subproject preparation and after&#13;
subproject completion. The component also allows for savings because of economies of&#13;
scale at the local level, since assistance can be contracted for several comrnunities at once&#13;
(e.g., retainer contracts for operating expenses of local extensionists). Finally, the&#13;
operation of the component is decentralized and encourages local-level accountability.&#13;
Municipal Councils will be responsible for applying resources from the component toward&#13;
assistance to communities in their jurisdictions and all technical assistance and training&#13;
agents hired by the Municipal Councils or by PRORIJRAL and approved by the Councils&#13;
(in FllMAC) would be held accountable to the Councils for their performance.&#13;
2.28  Complementary to the Institutional Development component, each community&#13;
association has the option of directing up to 8% of the cost of each subproject to hire&#13;
technical assistance and training support tailored to its particular subproject. A proposal&#13;
for the use of this percentage would be included in the subproject application. In addition,&#13;
because technical assistance should extend into the operation and maintenance period of&#13;
their subprojects, particularly for productive subprojects, community associations should&#13;
include technical assistance among the expenditures to be financed out of O&amp;M funds&#13;
maintained by each association. As part of their regular supervision efforts, PRORURAL&#13;
and the Municipal Councils would monitor the frequency and quality of technical&#13;
assistance and training provided to beneficiaries.&#13;
Targeting and Graduation&#13;
2.29  Beneficiary targeting would occur at three levels: (a) geographically by poverty&#13;
level and other characteristics of the municipality; (b) geographically within municipalities&#13;
to target rural settlements and communities; and (c) community-based selection of poor&#13;
beneficiaries and particularly vulnerable groups by the project Municipal Councils.&#13;
Targeting at the first and second levels defines the project area. The project area includes&#13;
all municipalities outside of the metropolitan region of Recife, the state capital. Project&#13;
beneficiaries, however, include only those rural communities located in settlements of less&#13;
than 7,500 people, resulting in a project target population of about 2.6 million people.&#13;
The target population therefore lives in small, more isolated rural areas with greater&#13;
representation of the rural poor. The third and principal level of targeting is community-&#13;
based. Increased decentralization of subproject selection through the expanded FUMAC&#13;
and FUMAC-P programs will further strengthen the project's capacity to reach the most&#13;
needy communities in the project area. The Municipal Councils' prioritization process is&#13;
the basis of targeting in the project since the communities themselves, through their&#13;
majority participation in the Councils, determine where project resources will best be&#13;
applied based on their first-hand knowledge of community socio-economic conditions and&#13;
local investment needs. The clear and transparent rules and procedures for the Councils'&#13;
functioning, are also important for targeting poor beneficiaries at the lowest level. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
effectiveness of the targeting methodology in directing project benefits to the poor would&#13;
be assessed through the project monitoring system and through annual performance&#13;
reviews and the implementation review (Annex H). Details on targeting mechanisms are&#13;
included in Annex C. During appraisal, agreements were reached with the State of&#13;
Pernambuco on these targeting mechanisms; these understandings would be reflected in&#13;
the final Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.30 Graduation of Communities and Municipalities. The demand-driven&#13;
community development model presented in the proposed project is expected to increase&#13;
the income-generating capacity and standards of living in the beneficiary communities.&#13;
Because project resources will be targeted to the poorest rural communities, certain&#13;
communities with better socio-economic standing relative to others would gradually&#13;
receive fewer investment resources during the course of project implementation. These&#13;
communities, able to leverage a critical mass of subprojects and other benefits from this&#13;
and previous Bank-financed and other projects, would gain access to other sources of&#13;
financing and reach a point where a "safety net" is no longer necessary. In order to&#13;
formalize this process, the proposed project would introduce a community graduation&#13;
strategy whereby those communities with demonstrated capacity for sustainable asset-&#13;
accumulation (savings), adequate social and economic infrastructure and community&#13;
organization, would progressively be charged a higher cost-sharing percentage (para.&#13;
2.45) and then eventually cease to be eligible for project matching grants (see Annex C).&#13;
To make this determination, profiles of beneficiary communities would be developed and&#13;
would include information on benefits from the reformulated NRDP and other public&#13;
programs, existing infrastructure and access to social services, indicators of&#13;
accumulation/savings (e.g., farm animals and equipment) and other indicators of&#13;
community well-being. The information would be collected from subproject proposals&#13;
submitted by the communities, incorporated into the MIS, and regularly updated through&#13;
monitoring and supervision exercises (see Annex H). The point at which a community&#13;
would provide a higher counterpart contribution and the subsequent "take-off' point, the&#13;
point at which a community would graduate from the project, would be estimated at the&#13;
end of the second year of the project, based on a study comparing community profiles and&#13;
indicators from the baseline impact evaluation. Using this analysis, PRORURAL (for&#13;
PAC) and the Municipal Councils (for FUMAC and FUMAC-P), with the support of&#13;
PRORURAL, would graduate those communities having reached the "take-off' point. As&#13;
communities graduate, those municipalities with fewer eligible communities would&#13;
gradually receive less funding for subprojects and, concurrently, would graduate from the&#13;
program as well. During appraisal, agreements were reached with the State of&#13;
Pernambuco on a community graduation strategy; these understandings would be reflected&#13;
in the final Project Operational Manual.&#13;
Community Subproject Cycle&#13;
2.31  Mobilization. The critical juncture in the community subproject cycle is the initial&#13;
stage when communities mobilize existing associations or form new associations which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
can then benefit from the project. At the outset of and throughout the project, a publicity&#13;
campaign, carefully programmed and targeted to participating communities by&#13;
PRORURAL to create a level playing field for access to project funds, would disseminate&#13;
information about the project and its procedures to stimulate demand from potential&#13;
beneficiaries across the state. Some communities already have significant levels of&#13;
organization, either traditionally or from previous development projects in the area, and&#13;
are poised to benefit immediately from the project. However, for those less organized&#13;
communities, the project, through the Institutional Development component, would&#13;
actively extend mobilization assistance through the services of NGOs or accredited state&#13;
agents (e.g., EMATER extension agents) who know the communities well and can serve&#13;
as catalysts for organization. These NGOs or accredited agents would mobilize the&#13;
communities and provide them with technical assistance for identifying and prioritizing&#13;
their needs and demands, preparing subprojects and forming associations, in order that all&#13;
communities in the project area can participate in project benefits. Through the MIS and&#13;
regular supervision, PRORURAL and project Municipal Councils would monitor the ex-&#13;
post allocation of project benefits, which would then facilitate targeting assistance to those&#13;
municipalities which had not yet received support.&#13;
2.32  Prioritization and Preparation. Beneficiaries submit proposals for subproject&#13;
investments based on priority needs of their communities. Standard documentation for&#13;
subproject proposals, developed by PRORURAL, would be distributed to the beneficiary&#13;
associations to facilitate the subproject preparation and screening process. To ensure the&#13;
quality of the investments financed and to provide guidance to the beneficiaries when&#13;
preparing subprojects, the Project Operational Manual would contain standardized&#13;
technical designs, including simple environmental guidelines and cost parameters (e.g.,&#13;
cost per physical unit or per beneficiary) for the most frequent types of investments.&#13;
Beneficiary associations may request technical assistance for more sophisticated or less&#13;
common subproject types.&#13;
2.33  Various standard designs already exist, and others would be developed under the&#13;
project (Annex G). In some cases, specialists would be contracted to prepare the designs,&#13;
based on terms of reference agreed with the Bank. In others, PRORURAll would gather&#13;
and adapt existing designs (e.g., for pipes or box culverts, retaining walls, fords, and decks&#13;
of bridges) and make them available to the Municipal Councils and associations. Standard&#13;
designs will include the following considerations, where appropriate: (a) engineering&#13;
aspects; (b) technical, financial and economic feasibility; (c) operation and maintenance;&#13;
(d) recommendations on environmental impact; and (e) social demand. This process will&#13;
be facilitated by the ongoing Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects in Bahia, Ceara and&#13;
Sergipe, and by the fact that other Northeast States will be developing similar projects&#13;
and, hence, there will be considerable scope for dissemination and exchange of designs&#13;
among the professionals of PRORURAL and the other State PCUs.&#13;
2.34 Appraisal. The appraisal of community subprojects would be carried out by the&#13;
Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-P) or PRORURAL (under PAC). The&#13;
appraisal procedures would take into account: (a) compliance with the project's guidelines&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
and eligibility criteria, including those related to the technical, environmental and cost&#13;
specifications contained in the Project Operational Manual; (b) the beneficiary&#13;
association's commitment to provide the required contribution and to take full&#13;
responsibility for the execution, operation and maintenance of the investments to be&#13;
funded; and (c) in the case of an association which has already benefited from other&#13;
subprojects, assessment of past performance. Using standardized cost indicators,&#13;
reasonable costing for subproject implementation would be ensured. Departures from&#13;
standard designs would have to be fully justified in the subproject proposal for review by&#13;
the Municipal Councils and/or PRORURAL, as would proposed investments which fall&#13;
outside the range of standardized costs.&#13;
2.35  Financing. In order to disburse funds for subprojecl: implementation, agreements&#13;
(convenios) would be signed: (a) under FUMAC, between F'RORURAL, the Municipal&#13;
Council and the beneficiary association for subproject funding and implementation; (b)&#13;
under FUMAC-P, between the Municipal Council and the association, for subproject&#13;
funding and implementation, and between PRORURAL and the Municipal Council for&#13;
release of project funds; and (c) under PAC, between PRORURAL and the beneficiary&#13;
association for subproject funding and implementation. Such agreements would spell out&#13;
the terms and conditions for the funding, execution, ownership, operation and&#13;
maintenance of the approved subprojects (para. 2.10). The final model agreements would&#13;
form part of the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.36  Subproject Supervision. Direct supervision and administration of the subprojects&#13;
are carried out by a community-elected Supervision and Control Committee (Annex D),&#13;
which oversees subproject execution, including contracting. This Committee of 3 to 4&#13;
persons is comprised of subproject beneficiaries, both members of the association and non-&#13;
members within the community. PRORURAL, the Municipal Councils or other&#13;
contracted groups, would visit the subproject sites during subproject execution to liaise&#13;
with the Supervision Committee and monitor physical and financial progress.&#13;
PRORURAL would have overall responsibility for supervision of the entire subproject&#13;
cycle through the project Management Information System (MIS) (Annex H), which&#13;
would track subproject progress from initial submission to completion, and through&#13;
accounting and auditing arrangements.&#13;
2.37 Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M). Community associations would bear the&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M for all investments, as specified in the convenio for release of&#13;
project funds. These associations may request technical assistance to develop O&amp;M&#13;
programs and techniques. Experience to date under the NRDP has been positive with&#13;
respect to O&amp;M of investments when local communities have a strong sense of ownership.&#13;
2.38  Operational Checks and Balances. Operational checks and balances, included in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual, would promote transparency and accountability in the use&#13;
of project funds. Increased decentralization of resources and decision-making to&#13;
beneficiary associations and Municipal Councils, with only ex-post control by the State&#13;
through audit of accounts and supervision and monitoring by PRORURAL, is central to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
the project strategy. However, this advancement would be accompanied by operational&#13;
disincentives, based mainly on education/joint problem solving and, as a last resort,&#13;
penalties, to deter potential departures from project guidelines such as misappropriation,&#13;
mistargeting, lack of participation or improper O&amp;M. Positive incentives for adherence to&#13;
project guidelines and or superior performance include the promotion of Municipal&#13;
Councils from FUMAC to FUMAC-P and, in FUMAC-P, a potential increase in the&#13;
Councils' budget envelope.&#13;
2.39 Project Monitoring and Supervision. Analysis of implementation will depend&#13;
on a database of subproject information from the project MIS, created under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP and to be improved under the project (para. 2.16). Inputs to the&#13;
database would be made from a standard data sheet at key stages of the subproject cycle&#13;
(e.g., identification, appraisal, procurement and disbursement. See also Annex H).&#13;
Periodic processing of the database information will permit the monitoring of the&#13;
characteristics and evolution of project implementation. PRORUIRAL, with project&#13;
Municipal Councils, will be responsible for meeting and reporting on the project&#13;
performance indicators (para. 2.16). The Bank's Recife Office would monitor project&#13;
performance indicators through the MIS, which the Recife Office will maintain and update&#13;
on a regular basis with inputs from the states, and through review of monthly&#13;
disbursement summaries. The Recife Office will also supervise subproject implementation&#13;
progress on a sample basis in the field (see Annex J for Supervision Plan).&#13;
2.40 Project Operational Manual. The NRDP Operational Manual (Annex K) would&#13;
be adjusted and expanded to reflect the need for fine-tuning and additions based on&#13;
experience to date. Agreements were reached with the State during appraisal on the&#13;
following points to update and/or include in the Manual: (a) indicative quantitative and&#13;
qualitative targets to be tracked with the Project MIS; (b) the project area and the criteria&#13;
used to select the municipalities included in the project area; (c) the initial distribution of&#13;
municipalities among the three components (FUMAC, FUMAC-P and PAC) and the&#13;
criteria for future redistribution; (d) guidelines for the pilot component (FlUMAC-P); (e)&#13;
arrangements for institutional strengthening and project administration, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation; (f) PRORURAL's new structure and additional technical support agreements&#13;

Project Costs&#13;
2.41   The total project cost, calculated in July 1996 prices and including contingencies,&#13;
is estimated at US$52 mnillion. Foreign exchange costs are estimated to be US$11.3&#13;
million, equivalent to about 22% of total project cost. The baseline cost is estimated at&#13;
US$51.4 million, and contingencies at US$0.6 million. Contingencies are low because&#13;
they apply only to the two components of institutional development (except for costs&#13;
associated with technical assistance for state reform) and project administration,&#13;
supervision, monitoring and evaluation. For these activities, physical contingencies of&#13;
10% and 5% have been included, as well as annual price increases for local and foreign&#13;
costs (both expressed in US dollars). No contingency provisions have been applied to the&#13;
community subprojects component. Since the number of cormmunity investments is not&#13;
defined ex ante, it was considered preferable that any change in physical or price attributes&#13;
of subproject investments would be accommodated by a change in the number of&#13;
subprojects approved and implemented.&#13;
2.42  Investments in subprojects are expected to represent some 90% of the total base&#13;
cost (57% for FUMAC, 8% for FUMAC-P and 25% for PAC). The distribution among&#13;
different categories of subprojects, as well as the phasing of expenditures over the four-&#13;
year implementation period, are indicative only, and there would be flexibility to reallocate&#13;
funds from the PAC to the FUMAC or FUhMAC-P subcomponents as Municipal Councils&#13;
gain experience.&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
2.43 The Borrower would be the State of Pernambuco. The loan wouldL be guaranteed&#13;
by the Federative Republic of Brazil. In accordance with the Progress Report on the CAS&#13;
reviewed by the Board on June 20, 1996, and in reference to the strategy to be adopted&#13;
for special assistance to poor States, the State of Pernambuco qualifies as a Borrower in&#13;
the context of this loan. The State Government of Pernambuco has formulated and is&#13;
adopting measures for administrative and other state reforms that will improve its fiscal&#13;
situation and ensure its capacity to contribute required counterpart funding to the project&#13;
and to repay the loan.7&#13;
2.44  The Bank loan would be repayable over 15 years, including a five-year grace&#13;
period, and would bear interest at the Bank's standard variable rate. The loan of US$39&#13;
7  An annex on Fiscal Sustainability and Technical Assistance for State Reform is available to the&#13;
Executive Directors upon request.&#13;

million equivalent would finance about 75% of the total project cost, and would disburse&#13;
against 100% of expenditures for technical assistance, training and evaluation studies,&#13;
75% of expenditures for community subprojects, 50% of expenditures for supervision&#13;
(except salaries) and 20% of incremental project administrative costs (except salaries) and&#13;
monitoring. The State Government would be responsible for the remaining 25% of total&#13;
project cost, with beneficiaries and their respective municipal governments contributing to&#13;
these counterpart funds. The State Government of Pernambuco is expected to meet its&#13;
counterpart funding obligations without difficulty. The State has consistently met all of its&#13;
counterpart funding obligations under the reformulated NRDP. The level of annual&#13;
funding required under the new project would be similar, and would be equivalent to less&#13;
than one percent of the State's total budget. Beneficiaries would provide a minimum of&#13;
10% of the total costs of community-managed investments, in cash, labor or kind,&#13;
amounting to US$4.6 million. To enable the early start-up of project activities, retroactive&#13;
financing would be provided up to a maximum of US$3.9 million in respect of eligible&#13;
expenditures incurred up to twelve months before loan signing, but after July 1, 1996,&#13;
when the project was appraised. In addition to training for new Municipal Councils, the&#13;
State already has a substantial pipeline of community subprojects for review and financing&#13;
for which it can utilize this retroactive financing facility. Detailed project costs and the&#13;
financing plan are presented in the table below.&#13;

2.45  Cost Sharing and Sustainability. The cost estimates and average size of&#13;
community-managed subproject investments have been determined based on the&#13;
experience gained under the reformulated NRDP and the operation of its PAC and&#13;
FUJMAC components. On this basis, the project is expected. to finance some 1,660&#13;
community-managed subprojects over four years. Counterpart contributions by the&#13;
beneficiary communities and their respective municipal governments would be made&#13;
according to a cost-sharing matrix, to be agreed with the State Government at appraisal&#13;
among the improvements to the Operational Manual (para. 2.40) and to be included in the&#13;
project Operational Manual. The minimum contribution of beneficiaries would be 10% --&#13;
to increase for beneficiaries from select communities as a first step toward graduation&#13;
from the project-- and of municipal governments would be 5% (recommended but not&#13;
required). The relative share contributed by each community and municipal government&#13;
would be based on agreement between the two parties with the Municipal Council. As in&#13;
the existing NRDP, ownership of project facilities by the beneficiaries should enhance the&#13;
sustainability of community investments. A key element would be the establishment of&#13;
sound arrangements under the project for the provision of operating, mainitenance and&#13;
capital replacement expenditures, the requirements for which would vary significantly&#13;
among types of subprojects and the availability of which would vary by municipality and&#13;
community association. The Project Operational Manual and the subproject agreements&#13;
(convenios) (para. 2.10) would contain specific guidelines concerning the funding of these&#13;
costs.&#13;
2.46  Experience since reformulation indicates that the sustainability of the proposed&#13;
projects is generally good. The community-based subprojects would finance relatively&#13;
small investments which can easily be maintained by the comamunities themselves, both&#13;
technically and financially, as demonstrated under the NRDP, even prior to the 1993&#13;
reformulation with the APCR component (see para. 1.13). Equally important is the fact&#13;
that client-driven subprojects, identified and implemented by the communities, have&#13;
demonstrated a high degree of ownership by the beneficiary groups and their consequent&#13;
willingness to maintain project investments. Under the reformulated NRDP, commitment&#13;
by each community group for operation and maintenance was a condition for the approval&#13;
of subprojects, and formed part of the subproject agreement: to be signed with the&#13;
beneficiary community. Compliance has been good and these same featu:res are built into&#13;
the proposed project. Finally, the formation and strengthening of project Municipal&#13;
Councils, which have been piloted successfully under the re-formulated NRDP and will&#13;
continue under the proposed project, stimulate grassroots participation in local&#13;
development, and thus foster longer-term project sustainability.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
2.47  Procurement for community subprojects costing the equivalent of US$50,000 or&#13;
less and procured by local communities, would be carried out mainly through direct&#13;
contracting, and under subproject agreements signed between the Project Coordinating&#13;
Unit (PRORURAL) and the community. This procurement procedure is appropriate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
because most subprojects: (a) would be small and/or implemented in scattered or remote&#13;
areas and therefore it will be difficult to obtain competitive proposals; (b) can be managed&#13;
directly by rural communities which will contribute to the work through the donation of&#13;
unskilled labor and local materials; (c) will be selected on the basis of willingness of the&#13;
beneficiary communities to contribute to and physically supervise their execution; and (d)&#13;
would provide a vehicle for communities to play an active role in the local development&#13;
process. There may be cases when the community lacks the capacity to make the&#13;
necessary purchases of equipment and materials. For such subprojects, PRORURAL&#13;
would make purchases on behalf of the communities, packaging the procurement for&#13;
several subprojects whenever possible. Procurement by PRORURAL would follow: (i)&#13;
National Shopping procedures for goods, and procedures acceptable to the Bank for&#13;
procurement of small works under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis&#13;
of price quotations (under US$ 100,000 and up to an aggregate amount of US$ 1.1 million&#13;
for goods and US$1.1 million for small works); or (ii) National Competitive Bidding --&#13;
NCB (over US$100,000). For NCB the standard bidding documents agreed between the&#13;
Bank and the Federal Government of Brazil will be used. ICB is not anticipated for any&#13;
goods or works under the project. Although the costs of individual subprojects may not&#13;
exceed US$50,000, the average size of the subprojects is expected to be less than&#13;
US$30,000. Approximately 420 subprojects are expected to be implemented yearly using&#13;
these procurement methods.&#13;
2.48 Prior review of procurement documentation by the Bank would be made for all&#13;
NCB contracts. Although the level of Bank prior review of procurement would be low, it&#13;
would be compensated in several ways. First, a study of procurement by community&#13;
contracting would be carried out during the first year of the project, under terms of&#13;
reference agreed during appraisal. Second, cost comparisons of similar subprojects would&#13;
be conducted using the project MIS (para. 2.16) in order to detect possible procurement&#13;
problems. Third, the project physical performance evaluation (Annex H) would analyze&#13;
procurement issues; and finally, during Bank supervision, random reviews would be&#13;
conducted of subprojects, including field visits and review of subproject documentation.&#13;
2.49  Consultant services to provide technical assistance and training to the beneficiary&#13;
communities, the Municipal Councils and PRORURAL would be procured in accordance&#13;
with Bank guidelines for the use of consultants. Contracts, short lists, and selection&#13;
procedures for technical assistance and training would receive prior review by the Bank&#13;
when the value of the contract is US$100,000 or more for consulting firms or US$50,000&#13;
or more for individual consultants. All consultant terms of reference would be subject to&#13;
Bank prior review. During negotiations, assurances were provided by the State of&#13;
Pernambuco that: (a) the above procurement arrangements would be followed (para.&#13;
3. 1(d)); and (b) the study of procurement by community contracting referred to in para.&#13;
2.48 would be carried out during the first year of the project and any agreed&#13;
recommendations adopted expeditiously (para. 3. 1(d)). Procurement arrangements are&#13;
summarized in the table below.&#13;

Disbursements and Special Account&#13;
2.50   The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of four years. The&#13;
project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2000, and the project's Closing Date&#13;
is June 30, 2001. The disbursement period shown in the projected Disbursement Schedule&#13;
(Annex I) is shorter than the Bank's standard disbursement profile for rural development&#13;
projects in Brazil, but is in line with the recent experience under the reformulated NRDP&#13;
and with other Bank-financed social fund projects in Latin America. The allocation of&#13;
loan proceeds by disbursement category is shown in Annex I.&#13;
2.51   During negotiations, assurances were provided by the State of Pernambuco that it&#13;
would open and maintain a Special Account in US Dollars in a commercial bank for Bank&#13;
disbursements (para. 3.1(e)). The authorized allocation would be US$3.5 million,&#13;
adequate to cover the expected average four-month flow of disbursements under the&#13;
project. Disbursements for all expenditures would be made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs), except for goods and works exceeding US$100,000 equivalent;&#13;
contracts with consulting firms above US$100,000 equivalent; and with individuals above&#13;
US$50,000.&#13;

2.52 The information required for the compilation of SOEs would be maintained by&#13;
PRORURAL in the MIS data base. All SOEs would be transmitted by PRORURAL to&#13;
the Bank in Washington. Simultaneously, PRORURAL would send to the Bank's Recife&#13;
Office a copy of SOEs and reimbursement applications submitted to the Bank in&#13;
Washington, as well as updated information on the status of all subprojects, enabling a&#13;
rapid review of subproject eligibility. This procedure would allow the Bank and&#13;
PRORURAL management to maintain a cumulative account of the progress of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
2.53 The communities' contributions to subproject investments would be defined in the&#13;
agreement (convenio) between PRORURAL and the community association (for PAC),&#13;
between PRORURAL, the Municipal Council and the association (FUMAC) or between&#13;
the Municipal Council and the community association (FUMAC-P). Any contributions by&#13;
Municipal Governments would also be defined in the subproject agreements. Both&#13;
contributions would be computed as part of counterpart finance of the project.&#13;
Disbursements to the beneficiary associations would be made in one single installment to&#13;
facilitate the disbursement process. Simple, standard records, whose format would be&#13;
included in the Operational Manual, would be completed by a designated community&#13;
representative. They would be used to record cash contributions, materials and labor&#13;
inputs, and would be subject to project audit procedures.&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
2.54 PRORURAL would maintain separate accounts for project expenditures, which&#13;
would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The accounts&#13;
of the Municipal Councils (for the FUMAC-P subcomponent) and of the community&#13;
associations would also be subject to review by the independent auditors on a sample&#13;
basis. Finally, independent auditors would also audit the Special Account (para. 2.51).&#13;
Copies of the audit reports would be provided to the Bank within six months of the end of&#13;
each state fiscal year. The audit reports would convey the auditor's opinion and comment&#13;
as necessary on the methodology employed in the compilation of the statements of&#13;
expenditure, their accuracy, the relevance of supporting documents, eligibility for&#13;
financing in terms of the project's legal agreements and standards of record keeping and&#13;
internal controls related to the foregoing. The State of Pernambuco provided assurances&#13;
during negotiations that: (a) the Special Account and the project accounts would be&#13;
established, maintained and audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing&#13;
principles, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (b) with respect to&#13;
withdrawals on the basis of SOEs, that such audits would contain a separate opinion as to&#13;
whether the SOEs, together with the procedures involved in their preparation, support the&#13;
related withdrawals; and (c) certified copies of the audited accounts and of the auditors'&#13;
reports would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each project&#13;
fiscal year (para. 3. l(f)).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.55  The proposed project has been assigned a "B" environmental classification.&#13;
Because of their relatively small size, most PAC, FUMAC, and FUMAC-P subprojects&#13;
would not have a significant effect on the environment. The project would, however,&#13;
ensure proper environmental screening and enforcement measures, to prevent certain types&#13;
of productive or infrastructure subprojects from producing :negative effects on the&#13;
environment. The Operational Manual would specify key environmental criteria and&#13;
screening and enforcement procedures to be followed.&#13;
2.56  Based on specific criteria for different subproject types, each subproject proposal&#13;
presented by the community associations would include a simple environmental&#13;
assessment in the form of a "checklist", following a standard format. For standard&#13;
subproject types, environmental screening at the subproject approval stage would be the&#13;
responsibility of PRORURAL and Municipal Councils. For exceptional subproject types,&#13;
for which technical standards have not been developed, PRORURAL would screen the&#13;
subproject proposals in detail for environmental impact, contracting technical assistance&#13;
when necessary, and this assessment and any subsequent recommendations would be&#13;
incorporated into the subproject proposal. For the FUMAC-P subprojects, the Municipal&#13;
Councils would conduct the environmental screening together with either PRORURAL or&#13;
with contracted technical assistance, such as NGOs. PROR-URAL has identified expertise&#13;
within the state for technical assistance purposes and would. include environmental&#13;
education and awareness as part of its training to Municipal. Councils. Enforcement of&#13;
environmental criteria would be ensured via subproject supervision by PRORURAL and&#13;
Municipal Councils.&#13;
Poverty Category&#13;
2.57  The proposed project is part of the Bank's Program of Targeted Interventions.&#13;
Project municipalities in Pernambuco were determined based on poverty-related indicators&#13;
and other key parameters (see Annex C), which will ensure that project resources reach&#13;
those municipalities which contain a high concentration of rural poor. The project's&#13;
targeting mechanism is then centered on community-based selection, with the assumption&#13;
that local communities can best judge what their investmenrt priorities are in each&#13;
municipality. In particular, project Municipal Councils wouild be charged with targeting&#13;
poor rural dwellers and especially vulnerable groups, based on criteria including the socio-&#13;
economic situation of participating communities, their level of organization and the&#13;
availability of infrastructure and services. The transparency of rules and procedures for&#13;
Municipal Councils also would facilitate targeting under the project by permitting rural&#13;
communities to monitor local resource allocation decisions, Finally, communities which&#13;
eventually are determined to have capacity for sustainable asset-accumulation (savings)&#13;
and access to adequate social and economic infrastructure, would progressively be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
charged a higher cost-sharing percentage and then would be graduated out of the program&#13;
(para. 2.30).&#13;
Women's Participation&#13;
2.58  The full participation of women is critical to the poverty objectives of the project.&#13;
Bank-supported operations and studies in the Northeast of Brazil show the strong&#13;
correlation between the problems and needs of rural women and those of producers and&#13;
family units in general. Interestingly enough, they also show that community leaders in the&#13;
Northeast favor women's participation due to their willingness to provide assistance and&#13;
services, receptiveness to change, and greater likelihood of repaying debt. Responding to&#13;
lessons concerning women's participation, this project will seek to ensure that women's&#13;
activities (both traditional and innovative) are included; to support subprojects which&#13;
foster maternal/child health and day care facilities (the latter have proven invaluable under&#13;
the ongoing PAC/FUMAC operations in freeing rural women for income generating&#13;
activities); to target groups and activities in which female participation has proven&#13;
constructive; to provide technical assistance for women's subproject proposals and&#13;
implementation; and to monitor women's participation in the project and its benefits.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
2.59  The proposed project would result in an improved quality of life for some 650,000&#13;
people (130,000 families) (23% of the target population8), by providing improved access&#13;
to water supply and other basic social and economic infrastructure and services, and by&#13;
contributing to an increase in production, incomes and employment. Project-financed&#13;
rural water supply and minor irrigation works will be particularly important in reducing&#13;
vulnerability to drought. Productive subprojects will provide a vehicle for financing&#13;
improvements in input use, technology and value-adding activities, thus raising&#13;
productivity and incomes. Female community members will benefit especially from&#13;
subprojects such as water supply and some productive activities and social investments&#13;
which enable rural women to seek paying jobs and contribute to increased family cash&#13;
incomes. Annex B provides an assessment of the kind of benefits which have been&#13;
achieved to date for the most common types of subprojects under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP. These are illustrative of the kinds of benefits to the target population which are&#13;
expected, albeit on a larger scale, from the proposed project.&#13;
2.60  The proposed project will provide a safety net for some of the poorest segments of&#13;
Pernambuco's rural population who will likely continue to be affected by decreased public&#13;
investments for services during the period of fiscal adjustment and macroeconomic reform.&#13;
s  Assumes 10% of the beneficiaries are "repeater" beneficiaries and benefit from more than one&#13;
subproject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Another important project benefit will be the strengthening of the capacity of poor&#13;
municipalities and their communities to define and address priority needs, and to plan&#13;
execute their own development projects. It is expected that the new project will have a&#13;
similar impact on the mobilization of additional community and municipal resources, as&#13;
has the reformulated NRDP thus far (about 15% of resources invested by the program),&#13;
and this will improve the longer-term sustainability of investments. Project-related benefits&#13;
can potentially generate savings for state and municipal governments as well by reducing&#13;
certain budgetary obligations to rural areas, such as emergency water supply through&#13;
water trucks (carrospipa) or medical services. Finally, as aL result of benefits from the&#13;
project which lead to an overall improvement in community organization and well-being&#13;
and capacity to save, it is expected that a small number of beneficiary communities will&#13;
graduate from the project and gain access to alternative sources of financing.&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
2.61   Bank experience in Latin America and elsewhere suggests that the main sources of&#13;
risk for this type of program arise from: (a) irregular counterpart funding, which can&#13;
erode community confidence and interest in participating; (b) technical weaknesses and&#13;
inadequate supervision of large numbers of widely dispersecl subprojects; (c) mistargeting&#13;
of program resources; and (d) undue political interference in subproject selection, which&#13;
often has the corollary effect of depressing local initiative anid community involvement.&#13;
The funding risk will be mitigated by several distinguishing :features of the projects. The&#13;
Bank loan, which will finance 75% of total project expenditares, will be taken directly by&#13;
the State, thereby eliminating those disbursement delays previously encountered at the&#13;
Federal level and minimizing the overall counterpart funding obligation of the State. In&#13;
addition, counterpart funding responsibilities would be shared to a larger extent by the&#13;
municipalities, decreasing the relative proportion of the State's own participation, and,&#13;
unlike in the reformulated NRDP, beneficiary contributions under the proposed project&#13;
will be counted toward the global counterpart requirements The project will also help&#13;
address the State's fiscal deficit situation with technical assistance funds for administrative&#13;
reforms, thereby reducing the risk of counterpart funding difficulties. Finally, and perhaps&#13;
most importantly, the strong sense of ownership by the State, municipalities and&#13;
communities should help to protect project counterpart funding needs during the process&#13;
of allocating scarce budget resources. The risks of overdesi'gn and weak supervision at&#13;
the subproject level would be substantially reduced with the establishment of standard&#13;
technical designs and cost criteria for the most common types of subprojects, and a&#13;
reinforced institutional strengthening component with speciiic resources allocated to&#13;
technical assistance for community associations. Increased delegation of supervision&#13;
responsibilities by PRORllRAL to Municipal Councils and contracted public and non-&#13;
governmental agencies, will increase supervision coverage and will minimize the risk of&#13;
mistargeting of program resources. In addition, the project design has introduced a&#13;
system of strong operational disincentives against mistargetiing and other departures from&#13;
project guidelines. For instance, a community or municipality would be obligated to&#13;
redress the problem, or be cut off entirely from the prograni6 in cases of misappropriation,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
mistargeting or insufficient participation. Finally, an information campaign targeted to&#13;
potential beneficiaries and the expansion of the FUMAC and FUMAC-P programs, will&#13;
stimulate greater community participation and increase transparency in the selection of&#13;
subprojects and thereby work against negative political influence in the allocation of&#13;
project resources.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT -&#13;
PERNAMBUCO&#13;
A. PERNAMBUCO: A SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE&#13;
Geography and Climate&#13;
1.    The State of Pernambuco covers a territory of around 98,307 km2 and is bordered&#13;
on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the north by the states of Ceara and Paraiba, on the&#13;
west by Piaui and on the south by Minas Gerais and Alagoas. The state's long east/west&#13;
and narrow north/south configuration incorporates a range of agro-climatic regions and&#13;
micro-regions which have molded its socio-economic and productive patterns of&#13;
development. The state is divided into three major regions: (i) the Mata Atldntica&#13;
represents 10% of the territory, has an abundant rainfall of up to 2,000 mm per year,&#13;
fertile soils and is the main crop-growing region; (ii) the Agreste covering 20% of the&#13;
state, and with rainfall of 650 to 900 mm per year with a dry period of up to seven&#13;
months; and (iii) the Sertdo comprising 70% of the state, with annual rainfall below 500&#13;
mm and irregular dry periods of up to ten months; some 90% of the state is within the&#13;
semi-arid "drought polygon" characterized by severe, cyclical and often protracted&#13;
drought.&#13;
Demographic and Social Situation&#13;
2.    The population of the state is about 7.1 million (1991), of which 29% is rural and&#13;
71% is urban. Between 1980 and 1991 the population grew at about 1.4% per year --&#13;
compared to 1.8% for the northeast and 1.9% for Brazil overall--, a rate which has been&#13;
declining steadily in the past several decades principally due to reduced birthrates and&#13;
better medical assistance (mainly in urban areas), as well as reduced outmigration. The&#13;
Census of 1991 indicates a significant rate of return migration from outside the state,&#13;
combined with a continued exodus from rural areas to cities within the state. The average&#13;
annual rate of growth of the urban and rural populations in the period 1980-1991 was&#13;
respectively, 2.7% and -1.2%. Rapid urbanization, without a corresponding increase in&#13;
public investment in infrastructure - housing, sanitation, transport - has seen a visible&#13;
decline in standard of living both in the state capital Recife, and in urban centers in the&#13;
interior.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.    The severity of rural poverty in Pernambuco is borne out by the following&#13;
indicators': (i) about 73% of rural heads of households earn one minimum salary&#13;
(currently about US$112 per month) or less, compared to 41% in urban areas; (ii) around&#13;
92% of all rural families have inadequate water supply, compared to 31% in urban areas;&#13;
(iii) some 72% of rural families lack any form of sanitation, compared to 12% in urban&#13;
areas; (iv) illiteracy affects about 59% of rural dwellers and some 34% of all persons over&#13;
15 years; (v) about 50% of the rural population is indigent2; (vi) infant mortality --an&#13;
important indicator of standard of living-- is 68.7% overall (1990 data), compared to the&#13;
average for Brazil of 45.3%; in certain rural zones such as the Agreste Meridional, Mata&#13;
Umida, Mata Seca and Vale do Ipojuca, rates are up to three times the national average,&#13;
ranging from 108.5/1,000 live births to 137.8/1,000; (vii) rural housing is grossly&#13;
inadequate in many zones and contributes to the elevated incidence of Chagas disease,&#13;
while water-borne diseases such as verminose (worm) schistosomiasis and leshmaniasis&#13;
are also prevalent; (viii) available data on health services in rural areas indicates that,&#13;
outside the metropolitan area of Recife, there is one physician to every 3,015 inhabitants&#13;
and one dentist to 5,503 inhabitants3. As in other northeastern states, medical services are&#13;
concentrated in the capitals both of the state and its municipalities and in some large&#13;
centers, with rural services grossly deficient. Vaccination programs have been successful&#13;
in reducing and/or eradicating certain important diseases of childhood.&#13;
The State Economy&#13;
4.    The economy of Pernambuco has historically been based on the production of&#13;
primary products for export. In the 1970s important changes occurred consonant with&#13;
surging national economic expansion. The state economy registered important rates of&#13;
growth as a positive response to incentives provided by Government to stimulate private&#13;
investment. The process of agricultural modernization and industrialization caused&#13;
development to follow a marked regional pattern, characterized by a growing&#13;
concentration of productive activities and populations. The state's industrial infrastructure&#13;
became interdependent with the rest of Brazil, and thus vulnerable to the successes and&#13;
failures of the national economy. Almost 60% of the state work force is now&#13;
concentrated in the Metropolitan area of Recife, where some 70% of industrial value-&#13;
added is generated.&#13;

The Agricultural Sector&#13;
5.    The Agricultural Census of 1985 shows that small farms under 10 hectares account&#13;
for some 76% of all fann establishments, but only 11% of farmland; moving up the scale&#13;
to farms of 100 hectares or less (classified as small farms in terms of productive capacity&#13;
under semi-arid conditions in the absence of inputs), the percentage rises to 96% of total&#13;
farm establishments and 42% of farmland. Conversely, some 4% of farms hold 58% of&#13;
farmland. It is likely, given the increase in larger-scale commercial farming in the past&#13;
decade, that this concentration has intensified. In terms of land tenure, the 1985 Census&#13;
shows that 62% of producers owned their land (and presumably had title), while 9.5%&#13;
were renters, another 5% were sharecroppers and the balance of 23.5% were squatters4.&#13;
As in other states of the Northeast, perverse incentives limit access of the poor to land,&#13;
even on a temporaiy basis. For example, legislation on renting and sharecropping, typical&#13;
forms of temporary access to land, sets ceilings on rents and crop shares, providing almost&#13;
permanent rights to tenants after a few years but making such arrangements unattractive&#13;
to owners and reducing access for those the law was intencled to protect. Similarly,&#13;
agricultural land is a tax haven for wealthy investors, thus increasing its price and reducing&#13;
access for the smallholders and landless workers unable to take advantage of tax laws5.&#13;
6.    Several decades of policies seeking to modernize the agricultural sector have&#13;
shown a differentiation in terms of population and area (IICA, 1995). Strategies of&#13;
technological modernization, subsidized credit and minimum price guarantees have tended&#13;
to favor commercial production for export, the expansion of agro-industry, medium and&#13;
large producers and the concentration of landholding, to the exclusion of small producers&#13;
and rural labor which have been further marginalized and unable to share the economic&#13;
benefits of growth associated with these policies.&#13;
7.    The agricultural economy is based primarily on sugar cane, cotton and livestock,&#13;
export crops including grapes, melons and tomatoes and basic food crops including beans&#13;
manioc, corn and sweet potato. Cotton and basic foodcrops are traditionally grown by&#13;
smallholders. The sector has undergone important changes in recent years with a distinct&#13;
zonal focus and with critical impact on poorer rural populations: in the Zona da Mata,&#13;
which generates almost one-half of state agricultural production, the stimulus provided by&#13;
the PROALCOOL program has witnessed a doubling of sugarcane production to 23&#13;
mnillion tons per year between 1970 and 1990, accompanied by an intense process of land&#13;
concentration, and the conversion of employment opportunities to temporary and&#13;
irregular. The recent crisis in the subsector has seen the closing down of processing&#13;
facilities and dismissal of large numbers of workers with little or no prospect of finding&#13;
alternative, formal and permanent employment.&#13;

8.    Cotton, the principal cash crop of small producers, has declined to the point of&#13;
extinction due to the impact of low prices, drought, disease and credit access problems;&#13;
area under cultivation decreased from 378,000 hectares in 1970, to just 45,000 hectares in&#13;
1990, and production decreased in the same period by about 93%, from 66 tons to just 5&#13;
tons. In marked contrast, irrigated agriculture for export has shown great dynamism with&#13;
production of grapes, tomatoes and melons increasing by huge margins each year since&#13;
1970. In the Agreste, livestock husbandry has benefited from official assistance programs&#13;
designed to modernize breeding, health and sanitary practices; however, in other regions&#13;
which have not had this service, recurrent drought has impacted heavily on herd size and&#13;
consequently on the standard of living in municipalities dependent on this activity.&#13;
Further, much land formerly under cotton has converted to livestock with important,&#13;
negative implications for labor absorption and income potential. A significant by-product&#13;
of these trends has been the major increase in participation of rural women in the labor&#13;
force.&#13;
9.    The rural poor, mostly smallholders, sharecroppers and wageworkers, as in the&#13;
rest of the northeast, rely on diverse sources of income -- traditional subsistence&#13;
agriculture and small-scale animal husbandry, cash crops (mainly cotton), casual work on-&#13;
and off-farm, and remittances from family members living in cities. Basic foodcrops and a&#13;
large part of the cotton crop are grown by small producers. Yields fluctuate greatly due&#13;
to the impact of erratic climate, insecure land tenure, the poor natural resource base and&#13;
inability to purchase inputs or to store water, intensive cropping on unsuitable lands and&#13;
generally low levels of technology. The implications of this decline are clear given that&#13;
cotton has been the principal source of cash income for the majority of the poorer rural&#13;
population. Foodcrops are grown mainly for household subsistence; their production has&#13;
also fallen steadily since 1970. The average rural income per capita in Pernambuco in&#13;
1990 was estimated at around US$240 per year, corresponding to 57% of the nation-wide&#13;
poverty line of around US$417 (Estrategia de Desenvolvimento e Combate a Pobreza,&#13;
INAE, July 1994).&#13;
State Government Strategy to Alleviate Poverty&#13;
10.   The State's Multi-Year Plan for 1996/99 focuses on sustainable development and&#13;
stresses: (i) reducing inequality and combating misery; (ii) economic growth which&#13;
recognizes the difference in ecosystems, and addresses the structural aspects of&#13;
development; and (iii) institutional improvements permitting greater efficiency and&#13;
transparency in the provision of services. Poverty is a central preoccupation to be&#13;
addressed through increased employment and income, social organization, education,&#13;
natural resource conservation, and greater participation of poor, marginalized rural&#13;
communities. The Government is mindful of the lessons from the NRDP projects which&#13;
stress decentralization and local development. The Government intends to stimulate local&#13;
economies by strengthening and modernizing micro-enterprises, including small&#13;
commercial and entrepreneurial family farms, agro-processing and manufacturing, and&#13;
employment creation. It is supporting the development of cooperatives, and the work of&#13;
NGOs in organizing community productive ventures and would facilitate access to credit&#13;

and technology for small productive enterprises. The Government is also addressing the&#13;
situation of the semi-arid regions through rationalization of water resource use, especially&#13;
in the sertdo through construction of water storage infrastructure, the organization of&#13;
water users and the institutional development of involved agencies.&#13;
Experiences with Bank-Financed Development Programs&#13;
11.   The history of the State's involvement with Bank-financed rural development&#13;
programs is consistent with that of the other northeastern states: under&#13;
POLONORDESTE the Pernambuco Rural Development T'roject (Loan 1728-BR) met its&#13;
physical targets but implementation and disbursement delays occurred due to Federal&#13;
counterpart funding and rural credit problems, drought, over-centralized project&#13;
administration and limited beneficiary participation in project planning and execution.&#13;
Poor coordination, duplication of effort and competition for scarce funds were also key&#13;
factors. But the project did strengthen state institutional capabilities, and established&#13;
services and infrastructure which contributed to agricultural modernization and laid the&#13;
groundwork for further rural development programs.&#13;
12.   The Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP), initiated between 1985 and&#13;
1987, was largely unable to improve on the performance of POLONORDESTE but did&#13;
successfully launch the community-based rural development methodology through the&#13;
small APCR component; Pernambuco's experience also conformed to this pattern. The&#13;
NRDP, like POLONORDESTE, also did make other important contributions: it paved the&#13;
way for adrninistrative decentralization, a more strategic approach to rural development,&#13;
the involvement of NGOs and a greater role for communities in project planning and&#13;
execution. The NRDP projects in each of the northeast states were reformulated in 1993&#13;
by essentially converting the successful APCR component into the primary model.&#13;
State Performance under NRDP&#13;
13.   The NRDP-Pernambuco project closed on June 30, 1996, after a six-month&#13;
extension of the original closing date. Under the reformulated NRDP, Pernambuco's&#13;
performance was initially poor but, thanks to the efforts and commitment of the current&#13;
State Government, greatly improved in the past year and a half. After reformulation,&#13;
US$19.5 million were disbursed and US$3.2 million committed which, together with the&#13;
cancellation of US$20 million in December 1994, left a balance of only US$0.8 million.&#13;
The annual rate of disbursements after reformulation topped US$9 million, pushed&#13;
forward by a US$1 million per month disbursement rate in 1996. By closing, rural&#13;
community associations had submitted some 4,159 subproject applications, of which 1,237&#13;
were financed and/or completed. 55% of the approved inviestments were infrastructure&#13;
subprojects, 37% were productive and 8% were social subprojects.&#13;

B. THE REFORMULATED NORTHEAST RURAL&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (NRDP): PERFORMANCE AND&#13;
EVALUATION&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    With more than half of all Brazilians living in poverty and almost two-thirds of the&#13;
country's rural poor, the Northeast --covering nine States and a part of a tenth'-- has long&#13;
constituted the single largest rural poverty pocket in Latin America. Rural development programs&#13;
for this region have been financed by the Federal and State Governments since the early 1970s,&#13;
but all achieved limited success in alleviating poverty -- including the Northeast Rural&#13;
Development Program (NRDP), which was established in 1985 to improve living standards of&#13;
small farm families and reduce poverty in the Northeast. Through 1993, with the exception of&#13;
one component supporting small community projects, implementation of the NRDP lagged behind&#13;
sclhedule, and performance in meeting basic project objectives was weak. However, its innovative&#13;
community-based component, Apoio as Pequenas Comunidades Rurais (APCR.), relying on&#13;
community planning and organization and acknowledging the expressed needs of the&#13;
communities, produced very encouraging --and replicable-- results: the poverty alleviation impact&#13;
of the APCR was positive, the cost per family relatively low, and its disbursement and&#13;
commitment rates far exceeded those of other components. In 1993, drawing both on the&#13;
successful experience of the APCR component and on lessons learned with similar schemes&#13;
elsewhere in Latin America, the NRDP was reformulated and transformed in its entirety into a&#13;
community-based development program. This reformulation, concomitant with the administrative&#13;
and fiscal decentralization embodied in the new Brazilian constitution of 1988, decentralized&#13;
decision-making, program counterpart funding and implementation, from the Federal Government&#13;
to the States and local levels. It allowed rural communities to identify their own needs and&#13;
execute their own subprojects, while committing themselves to contributing to the cost of the&#13;
investments and taking charge of their operation and maintenance (O&amp;M). Reformulation was&#13;
effective in late 1993 and became frilly operational in all states in January 1994.&#13;
2.    Under the reformulated NRDP, matching grants are provided to rural community&#13;
associations to finance small-scale subprojects identified by these groups as priority investments to&#13;
improve community well-being. Choosing among eligible subprojects, the beneficiaries solicit&#13;
investments which respond to their most critical needs. There are two different delivery&#13;
The Northeast Region includes the States of Maranhao, Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba,&#13;
Pemambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia and the northern part of the State of Minas Gerais.&#13;

mechanisms for screening, approving and implementing community subprojects: (i) State&#13;
Community Schemes (PAC) in which rural communities submit their subproject investment&#13;
proposals directly to the State Project Technical Unit (TU). The TU screens, approves and&#13;
releases funds for subprojects, interacting directly with the beneficiaries; and (ii) Pilot Municipal&#13;
Community Schemes (FUIMAC), in which subprojects identified and prepared by rural&#13;
communities are presented to project Municipal Councils for review. The Councils, composed of&#13;
community members, local government representatives and representatives of civil society,&#13;
promote local-level consensus-building on priority needs through open "town meetings", and&#13;
screen and submit subprojects to the State for subsequent approval and financing. This pilot was&#13;
designed originally to reach only 10 municipalities per state but, due to its early success, it has&#13;
surpassed this initial target.&#13;
3.    This Annex presents a performance and impact analysis of almost three years of&#13;
implementation of the reformulated NRDP, as a result of an evaluation undertaken by FAO&#13;
(United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) and the Bank between October 1995 and&#13;
February 1996, and updated at appraisal of the proposed Rural Poverty Alleviation project.&#13;
Certain aspects of the analysis, based on the most recent information from NRDP's Simplified&#13;
Project Monitoring System (SSMP) as well as findings of earlie:r studies, cover the overall&#13;
program in the ten participating states. Other aspects, in particular the socio-economic impact of&#13;
subproject investments, have been analyzed specifically for the state of Pernambuco. Featured&#13;
below are: (i) the information base used for the evaluation; (ii) the status of implementation to date in&#13;
all ten states, with respect to NRDP subprojects and disbursements; (iii) an impact analysis of the&#13;
reformulated NRDP at the state and municipal levels for the ten states, and at the local level for the&#13;
state of Pemrnambuco; (iv) the advantages of FUMAC over PAC, the two delivery mechanisms&#13;
available in the NRDP; (v) a technical assessment of subprojects; (-%i) an assessment of institutional&#13;
performance in the program, and (vii) conclusions and recommendations for design improvements for&#13;
follow-up projects.&#13;
4.    Results of different evaluations of NRDP since its reforrmulation show that after several&#13;
years of experience with rural development efforts in the Northeast, a large measure of success&#13;
has been achieved in effectively reaching the rural poor through targeted interventions. However,&#13;
some aspects of program implementation and its innovative features are still in need of&#13;
improvement, which could be addressed by modifications to project design. The design of follow-&#13;
up projects should explicitly take into account the lessons derived from this and other evaluations&#13;
of the NRDP, which are consistent in many respects with lessons learned elsewhere in Latin&#13;
America and other regions with similar community-based development programs.&#13;

(d)   The World Bank/FAO evaluation, "The Reformulated NRDP: Performance and&#13;
Evaluation", carried out in February 1995 and presented in the SARs of the new&#13;
Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects for Bahia, Ceara and Sergipe (nos. 14390-BR,&#13;
14394-BR, and 14395-BR, respectively). In addition to the above mentioned&#13;
sources of information, this overall socio-economic impact evaluation based its&#13;
analysis on a group of 52 sample subprojects of 8 different types implemented in&#13;
the 10 states, obtained by using a random sampling methodology.2&#13;
STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Subprojects and Beneficiaries&#13;
6.    Statistical information from the SSMP on the performance of all ten states participating in&#13;
t;he reformulated NRDP is presented in Tables 1 to 6. As of June 30, 1996, about 41,000 PAC&#13;
amd FUMAC subproject proposals had been submitted by communities in all ten states. Of the&#13;
2  This methodology was built on statistical random sampling procedures from a universe of all subprojects&#13;
under implementation and/or completed at the beginning of 1995, as obtained from the SSMP. The&#13;
distribution of the sample for a given type of subproject among the states was based on the distribution&#13;
frequency of such subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -                       Annex B&#13;
total, 59% or 23,910 subprojects had been approved, of which 1.3,758 were completed and/or&#13;
under implementation (Table 1). Negotiations with intended beneficiary associations on the terms&#13;
of agreement and other issues were in process on the other 10,202 approved subprojects.&#13;
7.    To date, the reformulated NRDP has reached nearly 40% of rural poor families in the ten&#13;
Northeast states, including "repeater" families which have benefited from more than one&#13;
subproject. Based on the experience of Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte, it is estimated that&#13;
only 10% of community associations are repeater associations and, because some associations&#13;
may represent more than one community, that the number of repeater communities is even&#13;
smaller. Those with more than one subproject typically are better organized than others or, as in&#13;
the case of Rio Grande do Norte, are supported by NGOs or other technical assistance agencies.&#13;
Accumulating benefits from different subprojects has a significant impact on local development&#13;
and would be an important element of a graduation strategy (paira. 20). Nevertheless, it is equally&#13;
important that TUs strengthen their outreach program to reach previously unattended&#13;
communities, particularly those lacking organizational strength.&#13;
8.    Overall, some 120 different types of subprojects have been proposed by rural&#13;
communities, a large majority of which relate to basic rural infrastructure, followed by productive&#13;
subprojects (mostly small-scale agro-processing and communal itractors) and, to a lesser extent,&#13;
investments of a social nature (e.g., day care centers or house improvement). Table 2 shows&#13;
community demand for the most common types of subprojects for the NRDP as a whole, and&#13;
separately for the states of Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte and Piaui. While it is clear that&#13;
water supply and rural electrification are in great demand everyvhere, communities in certain&#13;
states like Rio Grande do Norte, encouraged by the state TUs, also tend to favor productive&#13;
investments. The nature of subprojects eventually financed generally corresponds to community&#13;
demand: out of the total number of subprojects that were completed or under implementation as&#13;
of end-June 1996, 58% were for rural infrastructure, 36% were productive subprojects and only&#13;
6% were social subprojects (Table 1).&#13;
9.    Local screening of subprojects accelerates processing; thus, in the FUMAC mode, there&#13;
are more subprojects per municipality than in PAC, more beneficiaries per subproject and lower&#13;
costs per beneficiary. In the ten states, subprojects approved under FUMAC represent about 20%&#13;
of the total, even though the pilot nature of this component limit:ed it to some 11% of recipient&#13;
municipalities. On average, 16.6 subprojects have been implemented per municipality under&#13;
FUMAC, compared with 10.1 under PAC (Table 3). Although the costs of PAC and FUMAC&#13;
subprojects are similar (Table 4), FUMAC subprojects involve at least 10% more beneficiaries,&#13;
resulting in a lower implementation cost per beneficiary. Among the ten states, Paraiba has the&#13;
highest proportion of FUMAC subprojects (62% of all subprojects approved in the state) while&#13;
Alagoas finds itself at the other extreme, having only 6% of all subprojects implemented under&#13;
FUMAC. Indeed, depending on the local political situation, conditions favorable to the FUMAC&#13;
process, as promoted under NRDP, differ from state to state.&#13;
10.   The average cost per subproject varies among project types, ranging from US$14,200 for&#13;
rice processing to US$32,500 for tractors and implements (Table 5). The overall average cost is&#13;
about US$24,000. As the nature and technical specification for a particular type of subproject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -                       Annex B&#13;
often differ substantially between states, there can also be large variations in the corresponding&#13;
costs.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
11.   Analysis of the progress of loan disbursements (including funds already committed) as of&#13;
July 19, 1996 (Table 6) shows that the program's disbursement rate has been significantly higher&#13;
than its historical equivalent before reformulation. In about two years and a half, a total of&#13;
'US$267.3 million of loan funds has been disbursed or committed under the program, or US$8.6&#13;
imillion per month, as compared to only US$3.5 million per month during the whole&#13;
implementation period of the original NRDP (1986-late 1993). It should also be noted that&#13;
municipalities in some states like Paraiba and Piaui have frequently contributed counterpart funds&#13;
in light of shortages at the state level. Overall, it is estimated that 93% of project funds disbursed&#13;
have reached the beneficiary communities directly, as compared with only 44% under the original&#13;
]NRDP. There is now a total outstanding loan balance of US$78.7 million, four of the loans&#13;
having closed on December 31, 1995 (Sergipe, Rio Grande do Norte, Bahia and Ceara), two&#13;
mnore on June 30, 1996 (Pernambuco and Piaui), and one on September 30, 1996 (Alagoas). The&#13;
remainder are scheduled to close on December 31, 1996.&#13;
EVALUATION&#13;
S3tate and Municipal Levels&#13;
12.   Based on conservative estimates derived from SSMP data and information provided by the&#13;
State TUs, there is ample evidence to show that the reformulated NRDP has been cost-effective in&#13;
attending to the rural poor in the Northeast and has a large potential to produce tax revenue for&#13;
the State and Municipal Governments. In particular:&#13;
I13.   NRDP investments are potentially cost-saving for State governments, in terms both of&#13;
construction costs of subprojects and water supply. First, with respect to construction costs, it&#13;
has been shown that infrastructure projects implemented by government agencies are, on average,&#13;
about 30% more expensive than projects implemented by communities. Merely assuming that half&#13;
of all subprojects implemented are effectively 30% cheaper than what they would have cost had&#13;
they been implemented by government agencies, the savings to the ten State governments in this&#13;
regard would be equivalent to US$51 million for the whole program as implemented to date (the&#13;
total investment cost of the approximately 13,700 subprojects financed as of June 30, 1996&#13;
amounts to about US$340 million).&#13;
14.   Second, NRDP investments in water supply create savings with respect to State and&#13;
rnunicipal budgetary resources spent on provision of water (by carropipa or water bowser) to&#13;
rural communities, which is necessary not only in periods of drought but also in years of "normal"&#13;
precipitation in the serni-arid region of the Northeast. NRDP rural water supply projects&#13;
mainimize that recurring expenditure and liberate these savings for other purposes. Thus, for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -                        Annex B&#13;
municipalities which have benefited from the 1,900 NRDP-financed water supply projects to date,&#13;
the actual annual savings to their respective budgets from not having to provide the&#13;
corresponding carrospipa are estimated to range --for all municipalities-- from about US$5&#13;
million in a year of normal precipitation to more than US$11 million in a drought year. In periods&#13;
of severe drought, savings can also accrue to the Federal Governrment, which normally provides&#13;
substantial emergency funds to the states in these periods.&#13;
15.   NRDP investments also generate tax revenue3 for the State and Municipal governments on&#13;
marketed outputs of productive subprojects. For example, the 4.7 manioc mill subprojects&#13;
financed in Pernambuco as of mid-1996 are estimated to generalte about US$63,000 of tax&#13;
revenues per year.&#13;
Local Level&#13;
16.   At the community level, NRDP subprojects have begun tlo generate significant&#13;
improvements in the local economy and in the quality of life of the beneficiaries. Beyond its&#13;
impact at the state and municipal levels, the reformulated NRDP, as found in the overall socio-&#13;
economic impact evaluation carried out in February 1995 (para. 5(d)), has resulted in a much&#13;
improved quality of life for the beneficiary communities. In most cases, it has also started to&#13;
generate increases in income and employment opportunities, which would expand further as&#13;
productive subprojects --most of which have been operating for less than two years-- come to full&#13;
maturity. And as subproject benefits are largely concentrated in the beneficiary communities, they&#13;
are leading to savings accumulation (both at household and community levels) and to&#13;
improvements in the local economy. These, in turn, contribute to preventing communities from&#13;
migrating elsewhere and, in some cases, to encouraging them to start small businesses and/or&#13;
other activities locally. Most of these findings are confirmed by the more recent (late 1995-early&#13;
1996) state-specific evaluation which was undertaken in Pernambuco and two other states. In&#13;
Pemambuco, more than 30 subprojects completed to date were surveyed in detail and six major&#13;
types of investments financed under the reformulated NRDP analyzed, accounting for more than&#13;
70% of all subprojects approved in this state. An abbreviated description of these main subproject&#13;
types is presented below. For each, aggregate SSMP data on the number of subprojects&#13;
completed and/or under implementation, total beneficiaries and average cost per beneficiary are&#13;
shown in Table 7, while Tables 8 and 9 present the results of the financial/economic analyses&#13;
undertaken for a number of representative productive subprojects in Pernambuco.&#13;
3  ICMS is the principal tax applicable to all marketed products, of which 75% goes to the State and 25% is&#13;
divided among the municipalities. Depending on the state, the rate of ][CMS varies according to the product.&#13;
In some states, as in Rio Grande do Norte and Pemambuco, some agricultural products (particularly staples&#13;
like manioc) are totally exempt of ICMS.&#13;

I-firastructure Subprojects&#13;
(a)    Rural water supply. Drought, a frequent occurrence in the Northeast, can have a&#13;
devastating impact on the lives of communities in this region. In periods when this&#13;
phenomenon occurs, there is great demand for this type of subproject. Due to&#13;
variation in physical conditions among the different areas, works implemented&#13;
differ according to the source of water (surface or groundwater) and the type of&#13;
infrastructure required (new or rehabilitated well, reservoir, fountain, etc.). Rural&#13;
water supply projects provide a precious resource which previously was obtained&#13;
only through long hours of walking or had to be supplied by the municipality by&#13;
carropipa (para. 14). They lead to savings in time, effort and cost, and often to&#13;
improved health through better sanitation with cleaner water than obtained&#13;
previously. However, these gains are difficult to quantify. In Pernambuco, it is&#13;
estimated that nearly 23,000 families are benefiting from the 121 subprojects&#13;
already --or soon to be-- completed in this category.&#13;
(b)    Rural electrification. Providing electricity to streets and households as well as&#13;
community shops and small-scale processing units, rural electrification subprojects&#13;
contribute to improving the quality of life of the local inhabitants by giving them&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-49 -                         Annex B&#13;
access to radio, television and the use of domestic appliances, and in some cases&#13;
generating additional employment and incomes from the increased operation of&#13;
local businesses and industries. In Pernambuco, a total of about 30,100 families&#13;
are benefiting from the 482 rural electrification subprojects under implementation&#13;
and/or completed, with more than 30,000 houses connected to electricity. Rural&#13;
households are charged an electricity fee, which varies slightly between the states.&#13;
Productive Subprojects&#13;
(a)    Tractors for communal use. Community-owned tractors with implements are a&#13;
very popular type of productive subproject. Tractor use has facilitated increases in&#13;
the areas cultivated with different crops (especially manioc, maize, beans,&#13;
horticultural crops and dry season rice) as well as in their yields and productivity,&#13;
often resulting in significant gains in the producfion and incomes of the&#13;
beneficiaries. As elsewhere in the world, tractors are labor-intensive when used&#13;
primarily in pre-harvest production activities. They are also used for farm&#13;
transport, which can reduce costs substantially for the producers. The 151 tractor&#13;
subprojects completed and/or being executed in Pernambuco are benefiting about&#13;
9,400 families with increased incomes of about UJS$320 per beneficiary family per&#13;
year. They are creating some 3,400 jobs (including the equivalent of additional&#13;
person-days for crop cultivation) and resulting irn a total incremental crop area of&#13;
32,900 ha (on average 3.5 ha per family)4.&#13;
(b)   Manioc flour mills. Casas defarinha are a familiar structure in all rural areas of&#13;
the Northeast, where manioc is a major food crop consumed primarily in the form&#13;
of flour. The main benefits from this type of subproject are reduced processing&#13;
costs (plus, in some cases, savings in transport to other mills located outside the&#13;
project area), leading to increased production both for sale and family&#13;
consumption. Where there is no other mill in the area, community-owned casas de&#13;
farinha replace home-made processing which is done in an artisanal, time-&#13;
consuming fashion and often produces poor quality flour. Because faster&#13;
processing allows the producers more time for p].anting and harvesting, the&#13;
installation of manioc mills is associated with an increase in the crop areas.&#13;
Additional jobs are also generated both for men and women working in the mills,&#13;
whose mechanization generally results in better working conditions. The 47 casas&#13;
defarinhia which have been completed and/or are under implementation in&#13;
Pernambuco are expected to benefit about 2,400 families, produce average&#13;
incremental incomes of US$270 per family per year and generate the equivalent of&#13;
some 480 jobs, including additional farm employment, with a total incremental&#13;
crop area of 1,800 ha (about 0.8 ha per family).&#13;
(c)    Small-scale irrigation. In Pernambuco and other states such as Minas Gerais,&#13;
irrigation infrastructure and equipment (kits) for small, communal schemes are&#13;
4  Usually cultivation is done on rented land or through sharecropping with the land owner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -                             Annex B&#13;
increasingly in demand by rural communities. The size of these schemes can vary&#13;
from 10 to 60 ha (benefiting between 30 and 100 or more farming families each),&#13;
where surface or groundwater is used for gravity or, more frequently, sprinkler&#13;
irrigation to produce high-value fruit and horticultural crops (e.g., pitanga,&#13;
inhame, etc.). It is estimated that the 30 small-scale irrigation subprojects&#13;
completed and/or currently executed in Pernambuco are benefiting about 2,500&#13;
farming families, whose incomes would rise significantly by US$1,300 per family&#13;
per year.&#13;
Social Subprojects&#13;
(a)    Health-related House improvement. The dwellings of many rural families in the&#13;
Northeast, and in particular Pernambuco, are in poor condition and often&#13;
associated with lack of hygiene which can lead to very serious health problems&#13;
(e.g., the often fatal Chagas disease, which is spread by an insect favoring wall&#13;
materials of traditional rural houses in the interior). It is estimated that the 85&#13;
house improvement subprojects under implementation and/or completed in&#13;
Pernambuco are benefiting some 8,800 families in total, and indications are that&#13;
consequent improvements in the living conditions of these families have an&#13;
important beneficial impact on their health.&#13;
17.    Generally, the analysis of sample cases surveyed indicates that the NRDP has made a&#13;
positive impact on the quality of life and, in the case of productive subprojects, on employment&#13;
alnd incomes of beneficiary communities or associations (Table 8). Results of financial and&#13;
economic analyses of productive subprojects show that internal economic rates of return (IERRs)&#13;
are high, investment per job created is low and benefit-cost ratios are satisfactory. For this&#13;
category of subprojects, all IERRs5 exceed 50% in financial as well as in economic terms. Both&#13;
analyses were made assuming constant benefits over an eight-year subproject life cycle. In most&#13;
cases, the estimated economic IERRs are higher than the financial ones: while the economic cost&#13;
of labor --which is the most important input in smallholder agriculture-- is very low due to severe&#13;
unemployment, economic prices of outputs, produced in small quantities and all traded internally&#13;
except for rice, are virtually the same as their financial prices. In addition, an analysis was carried&#13;
otut to determine the sensitivity of the IERRs to the distortionary effects of publicly-funded grants,&#13;
stemming from the costs associated with raising these funds (i.e., taxation). While using the&#13;
shadow price of public funds necessarily reduced the respective IERRs, these remained,&#13;
5   Methodology: Based on the results of interviews conducted in October 1995 with subproject beneficiaries and&#13;
other local stakeholders in the state, a methodology similar to the one used in the earlier, overall evaluation (para.&#13;
5(d)) was applied. Additionally, IERRs were estimated using economic as well as financial values to assess the&#13;
impact of the subprojects not only on the beneficiaries and their associations, but also on the community at large as&#13;
well as on the local economy. The economic analysis used specific conversion factors to translate financial prices of&#13;
both inputs and outputs into economic terms. For each project type, the total number of subprojects implemented or&#13;
completed, the total number of beneficiary families and the cost per beneficiary were derived from state SSMP data,&#13;
while quantitative benefits in terms of net incremental income, incremental crop area and jobs created, were&#13;
assessed, and IERRs and cost-effectiveness indicators estimated, from averages obtained from the subprojects&#13;
surveyed in that category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51 -                         Annex B&#13;
nonetheless, significantly positive and exceeded 17% in all cases. Cost-effectiveness results --in&#13;
terms of both employment creation and benefit-cost ratios-- were also very satisfactory. Cost-&#13;
effectiveness was determined by estimating, where appropriate, the total investment cost per&#13;
additional job created by the various types of productive subprojects, as well as benefit-cost&#13;
ratios. For all subprojects analyzed in Pernambuco, the initial investment per additional job&#13;
created is notably low (at least 10 times lower than in the industiy and service sectors) and&#13;
benefit-cost ratios are satisfactory (between 1.3 and 2.3). However, given the sampling nature of&#13;
the exercise and the variations that exist among subprojects in terms both of costs and&#13;
performance, results thus quantified should be taken as illustrative only.&#13;
18.   Analysis of selected productive subprojects shows that cost recovery through user fees by&#13;
the average beneficiary association is sufficient for operation and. maintenance, including&#13;
replacement of worn-out equipment. The financial sustainability analysis of selected productive&#13;
subprojects (manioc mills and farm tractors) shows that while beneficiary associations receive a&#13;
one-time investment grant from the program, this investment is financially sustainable because&#13;
cost recovery through user fees by the average beneficiary association is adequate to cover both&#13;
O&amp;M and replacement of the original investment by the end of ilts useful economic life (Table 9).&#13;
In the case of tractors, the net income of the associations owning the tractors and implements,&#13;
after deduction of all operation and maintenance expenditures, is sufficient to cover the initial&#13;
investment after a period of 5 years, as compared with an average useful economic life of 10&#13;
years. Likewise, the comparison between receipts and operating and maintenance costs&#13;
associated with manioc mills indicates that this type of investment is financially sustainable,&#13;
leaving the associations with enough funds to amortize the mill and its equipment in 7 years,&#13;
which is significantly less than its average useful economic life of 12 years.&#13;
19.   By improving the quality of life and economic and social conditions of beneficiaries, the&#13;
NRDP has initiated a process of accumulation at both the local and household levels, thereby&#13;
ensuring a degree of sustainability that previous development efftrts in the Northeast were not&#13;
able to provide. As found in the University of Michigan study (para. 5(c)), socio-economic&#13;
conditions in the communities that have been reached by the program have improved notably. In&#13;
particular, NRDP-funded investments accelerated the post-1993 drought recovery of these&#13;
communities, and provided them with incentives to use land more intensively. While rural&#13;
infrastructure and social subprojects have ameliorated, sometimes dramatically, living standards of&#13;
beneficiary families, they also have, along with productive subprojects, generated employment not&#13;
only for heads of rural households but also other members including women, and led to improved&#13;
welfare and increased, more stable, family incomes. As a result, ithe program has contributed to&#13;
elevating the economic conditions of beneficiaries above those generally found with rural&#13;
communities in the Northeast, providing them with initial start-up funds and allowing them to&#13;
start generating savings both for financing their own investments and eventually accessing formal&#13;
credit. In addition, a notable feature of the NRDP has been to encourage resource mobilization at&#13;
the municipal level, as demonstrated by the increasing financial participation of municipalities in&#13;
the program (para. 11).&#13;
20.   Given the relatively high EERRs of some productive subprojects, it could be argued that&#13;
these cases would be better attended through credit rather than through a grant mechanism.&#13;
However, the rural poor in the Northeast --the target group of the reformulated NRDP--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52 -                        Annex B&#13;
generally have limited access to credit for such micro-ventures. As an alternative to credit, the&#13;
grant mechanism provides the NRDP beneficiary communities with the means to accumulate&#13;
benefits at the local level and generate savings, which they could use to leverage with the financial&#13;
sector to obtain credit for investments and eventually graduate out of the program. However,&#13;
deternmination of the critical variables which would be applied to decide when a given community&#13;
or municipality should graduate from the program requires careful study.&#13;
ADVANTAGES OF FUMAC OVER PAC&#13;
21.   While the pilot nature of FUMAC under the reformulated NRDP necessarily limited its&#13;
area of intervention, experience to date demonstrates that this component has been successful and&#13;
should be expanded. First, as seen in para. 9, the data collected on subprojects implemented&#13;
under the program show that FUMAC has outperformed PAC in terms of number of beneficiaries&#13;
per subproject and costs per beneficiary.&#13;
22.   Second, the FUMAC approach has clearly achieved greater community participation and&#13;
transparency than PAC and has helped strengthen the capacity of communities to select and&#13;
implement subprojects. While socio-economic benefits produced by the two components are&#13;
similar in many respects, there is enough evidence, as found in Kottak and Costa's follow-up study&#13;
(1994), to assert that greater community participation and transparency in decision-making have&#13;
been achieved through FUMAC, since subproject proposals are deliberated not only by the&#13;
community but also by the project Municipal Council at open public meetings. Not only does&#13;
awareness of the program and its requirements appear to be stronger with FUMAC communities&#13;
tihan with PAC communities, but participation in decision-making has also been found to be higher&#13;
with the first group. Generally, as a result of better selection and prioritization by the&#13;
beneficiaries through the Municipal Council forum, FUMAC subprojects are able to meet the&#13;
program's criteria better than PAC subprojects. This more rigorous process in. FUMAC also&#13;
contributes to an increased capacity by communities in FUMAC municipalities to identify, plan&#13;
and implement subprojects. In addition, the stronger and more capable Municipal Councils served&#13;
as catalysts to increase community organization.&#13;
23.   Third, local governments and communities are committed to the FUMAC approach. The&#13;
suLccess of FUMAC can be gauged by the large degree of acceptance and commitment of both&#13;
local governments and communities, which have, in most states, adhered to its principles of&#13;
consensus building and local development planning, albeit in embryonic form. This has&#13;
translated, as in Maranhao and Paraiba, into the establishment in PAC municipalities of"FUMAC-&#13;
like" Councils, where local priorities are discussed and collective decisions are made on&#13;
subproject submissions to be forwarded to the TUs.&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT OF SUBPROJECTS&#13;
24.   NRDP investments are generally of good quality. In most PAC and FUMAC subprojects&#13;
executed in the ten states, a technical evaluation carried out by the Bank in late 1994 found that&#13;
works were generally of good quality, particularly when implemented by private contractors (75%&#13;
of subprojects). With the remaining 25% of subprojects (20% executed by municipalities, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                        Annex B&#13;
unskilled labor often provided by beneficiaries, and 5% implemented by the communities&#13;
themselves), the quality varied but remained generally fair to good. Only for a very small&#13;
proportion (less than 5% of all subprojects) was construction quality rated as poor.&#13;
25.   However, some shortcomings have been detected in a number of subprojects, namely the&#13;
overdesign of works due to lack of technical criteria and/or competent technical assistance, and leading&#13;
to discrepancies in investment size and costs per beneficiary for the same type of projects. In addition,&#13;
technical assistance provided by TUs or other entities to communities in planning and executing&#13;
projects, has sometimes been found to be inadequate. Despite the availability of funds under NRDP to&#13;
hire professional assistance with planning or implementation, such assistance is hard to secure in rural&#13;
areas -- in part because under the reformulated NRDP the cost of technical assistance for preparation&#13;
and implementation of a subproject is included in its cost estimate and funds cannot be released to&#13;
remunerate contracted professionals if the association's proposal has been rejected.&#13;
26.   Because of their relatively small size, PAC/FUMAC subprojects generally do not produce&#13;
significant effects on the environment. However, certain types of projects, by their very nature,&#13;
produce environmentally undesirable by-products (e.g., from the processing of manioc) or lead to&#13;
increased use of products that may have a negative environmental impact (fertilizers and&#13;
pesticides associated with the use of tractors, wood for fuel in cassava and rice mills, etc.).&#13;
Additional consideration would have to be given to these aspects under follow-up projects.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS&#13;
27.   Institutional analysis of the reformulated NRDP as it is implemented in the ten states, and&#13;
of the role played by the various actors in the program, yields a generally favorable picture.&#13;
28.   Once mobilized and legally established, community associations generally function well,&#13;
apart from some cases of apathy or of takeover by individuals trying to monopolize benefits.&#13;
Collective responsibilities such as appointment of office-holders, payment of dues or user fees and&#13;
accounting are generally met by the members, particularly of those associations which are well&#13;
organized, as in Minas Gerais where many date back to the start of the original NRDP. Some&#13;
community associations are newly-formed, having been mobilized with the objective of requesting&#13;
financing for a needed subproject, and do not have significant organizational experience at the&#13;
outset. While the potential for political influence exists in the organization of these community&#13;
associations, the outcome is generally favorable as these mayors facilitate the spread of&#13;
information about the project and provide the conditions necessar-y for communities to capitalize&#13;
on project benefits which meet their basic needs. In all ten states, community associations share a&#13;
common need for technical assistance. Not only is this essential for the organizational&#13;
development of newly-formed associations, but it is needed to assist all associations during the&#13;
whole subproject cycle, from preparation to implementation and ID&amp;M of subprojects. While&#13;
training and technical assistance is a critical input for all subprojects, the need for assistance is&#13;
more acute for productive subprojects where inadequate O&amp;M is often the result of lack of&#13;
technical know-how on the part of the communities in the absence of follow-up by the TUs.&#13;
Better access to organizational and management training will also contribute to the sustainability&#13;
of both community organizations and subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                       Annex B&#13;
29.   The FUMAC Municipal Councils are the focal point of the project's decentralization&#13;
strategy and must be protected from political interference which would undermine the demand-&#13;
dlriven nature of the project. In FUMAC, the Municipal Councils review and discuss in a public&#13;
forum the communities' subproject requests and forward these to the TU in priority order for&#13;
financing. The Councils are generally chaired by the mayors and comprise representatives from&#13;
both public and non-governmental agencies and community associations. Development and&#13;
performance of the project FUMAC Municipal Councils are affected by the attitude of the local&#13;
political power base, especially that of the mayor. Usually, mayors are supportive and the&#13;
dlisparate interests represented in the FUMAC councils have found a modus vivendi. For instance,&#13;
nmayors of the municipality of Afogados de Ingazeira in Pernambuco or that of Tibau do Sul in&#13;
Rio Grande do Norte are working hand in hand with their respective FUMAC Municipal Councils&#13;
and the community subprojects that have been financed are performing very satisfactorily. In fact,&#13;
mnayors in some states have adopted the FUMAC approach and applied it to decision-making on&#13;
allocation of non-project resources as well. On the other hand, in Pemambuco in the municipality&#13;
of Brejo da Madre de Deus, a rural water supply subproject financed for the community of Sitio&#13;
Calderao in late 1993, was never discussed within the FUMAC Municipal Council, and the mayor&#13;
hlas attempted to undermine the Council's autonomy. Similarly, in Piaui in the municipality of Jose&#13;
dLe Freitas, the FUMAC Council was not involved in the selection and implementation of two&#13;
subprojects --electrification and small-scale irrigation-- approved for the community of Ema,&#13;
neither of which has become fully operational. Therefore, while political influence can work to&#13;
the advantage of the Councils by facilitating the subproject approval process and forging mutual&#13;
bienefits for project Councils and municipal governments, this same influence can undermine the&#13;
dlemand-driven nature of the project if left unchecked.&#13;
30.   The participation and support of rural municipal governments is important for&#13;
sustainability and should be encouraged, but with sufficient safeguards against negative political&#13;
influence. While the project Municipal Councils act independently of municipal governments, the&#13;
participation and support of the latter is nonetheless important. Rural municipal governments&#13;
have limited financial resources with which to invest in rural communities and, hence, the&#13;
reformulated NRDP has served as an important source of funds at the local level to bridge the gap&#13;
in public resources for investment in poor rural communities. Experience under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP has demonstrated that the mayors and municipal leaders view the project as a welcome&#13;
source of additional resources for investment to meet basic community needs to which their&#13;
rmunicipal budgets cannot realistically attend. For the most part, mayors, municipal legislature&#13;
rmembers (vereadores) and municipal administrations have supported and participated in NRDP;&#13;
in some states, such as Piaui and Paraiba, the municipal governments have even provided the&#13;
counterpart funds which the financially strapped state governments were unable to supply. At&#13;
times, however, mayors or legislators have attempted to subvert the program to their own ends.&#13;
For example, in the municipality of Agua Branca in Piaui, a local politician has promoted&#13;
subprojects for different communities to improve his own local standing and attract supporters;&#13;
and in the municipality of Carnaiba in Pernambuco, a tractor subproject approved for a&#13;
community ended up being used by the prefeitura and not the community. Cases such as the&#13;
latter, where political manipulation directly penalized the communities through unrealized&#13;
subproject benefits, are rare. The former case, where communities benefit from subprojects&#13;
despite political influence, is much more common. Moreover, where local political leadership&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -                        Annex B&#13;
openly opposed the FUMAC approach, the PAC component allowed the community associations&#13;
to bypass the municipal authorities and submit proposals directly to the state TUs.&#13;
31.   Technical Units need assistance to streamline operational procedures and strengthen&#13;
project supervision. The TU is the focal point for project administration and is the project's&#13;
principal liaison for the Municipal Councils and for those community associations located in PAC&#13;
municipalities. The TUs are located within the Planning Secretariat of each state, with the&#13;
exception of Rio Grande do Norte where the TU falls under the responsibility of the State&#13;
Secretariat of Labor and Social Action (SETAS). Most have established several field offices,&#13;
each with one or more technicians. In some cases TUs also harndle other development programs&#13;
in the state, but usually these are programs of minor importance. That the TUs have generally&#13;
been successful in promoting NRDP is obvious from the overw]helming comnmunity response.&#13;
However, despite their size (generally 40-60 technicians), TUs find it hard to process the large&#13;
number of subproject proposals and to provide technical assistance for the preparation and&#13;
implementation of subprojects. Because the process of appraising subprojects and, in particular,&#13;
that of negotiating terms of agreement with beneficiary associations is time-consuming, not all of&#13;
the approximately 10,000 subprojects approved yearly are actually funded the same year. In&#13;
addition, supervision of subprojects is weak given the logistical constraints of visiting a large&#13;
number of subprojects. Project technical assistance is provided to the TUs and is mostly&#13;
contracted from international agencies, such as the Instituto Interamericano de CooperaVilo para&#13;
a Agricultura (IICA) and FAO.&#13;
32.   The successful cases of NGOs and other technical assistance providers participating in the&#13;
reformulated NRDP need to be replicated. One solution to the problem of the TUs' inability to&#13;
provide sufficient technical assistance and to supervise the large number of subprojects, has been&#13;
for the TUs to forge alliances with NGOs to provide technical support to communities and&#13;
monitoring services, as has been done successfully in Rio Grande do Norte with FETARN&#13;
(Federaqao Estadual dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura do Rio Grande do Norte), AACC and&#13;
other local NGOs, or to forge alliances with other technical assistance providers as in Minas&#13;
Gerais. In this latter state, for instance, EMATER provides high quality agricultural extension&#13;
services and has been more supportive and successful than in other states in contributing to&#13;
income-generating productive subprojects. However, even where there is no official alliance&#13;
between the TU and EMATER, individual extensionists may still support NRDP adpersonam. In&#13;
general, NGOs have played a mixed role. In certain states, churches, rural labor unions and some of&#13;
the more technical NGOs are playing a useful part in the implementation of subprojects -- stimulating&#13;
and helping with the initial formation of community associations or providing assistance with&#13;
submission or execution of community proposals. This has been the case, in particular, of Rio Grande&#13;
do Norte where NGOs, grouped together under the Forum do Campo, have part'icipated actively in the&#13;
project. In other states, some of the NGOs contacted through initiad publicity campaigns were unsuited&#13;
or unwilling to become involved in the reformulated NRDP, while others would only participate if&#13;
project funds were channeled through them.&#13;
33.   The World Bank Recife Office is fundamental to the implementation and supervision of&#13;
the reformulated NRDP. The World Bank's office in Recife (Pernambuco) has three task&#13;
managers dedicated exclusively to working with the ten states u:nder the project. By delegating all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                        Annex B&#13;
supervision activities to the Recife Office, including procurement reviews and field visits, World&#13;
]Bank support is better tailored to the decentralized structure of the reformulated NRDP.&#13;
34.   Institutional analysis shows that, by assigning greater responsibility and influence to local&#13;
level organizations and municipal government, the reformulated NRDP's primary achievement has&#13;
been to support a decentralized approach to resource allocation in the rural areas of the&#13;
Northeast. Even at this early stage in the implementation of the approach adopted by the&#13;
reformulated NRDP, it is possible to draw certain conclusions about its institutional arrangements&#13;
and performance. The capacity of both communities and municipal governments to prioritize&#13;
investment decisions is strengthened by the program's subproject development and approval&#13;
process. The program has provided a fiscal incentive to decentralized decision-making, since&#13;
local level decisions are backed by inflows of project resources. The FUMAC approach, in&#13;
particular, has not only placed the power to prioritize community investment proposals with local&#13;
level organizations, but has also introduced transparency into the resource allocation process for&#13;
rural investments at the municipal level, thereby minimizing the traditional clientelistic approach.&#13;
FlUMAC provides a forum, which did not exist before, for local government representatives and&#13;
community representatives to discuss investment needs and priorities. As FUMAC spreads&#13;
beyond its current pilot phase and as municipalities gain more years of experience with the&#13;
mechanism, municipal governments will become more accustomed to participatory decision-&#13;
mnaking processes, and rural community associations will continue to exercise their voice&#13;
35.   The reformulated NRDP is nonetheless vulnerable to political interference, particularly&#13;
where local level organizations such as community associations and FUMAC Municipal Councils&#13;
are newly formed, lacking sufficient information, or without adequate technical assistance and&#13;
training, which need to be addressed in follow-up projects. Experience under the reformulated&#13;
TNRDP demonstrates that there is a fine line between participation of local political leaders in the&#13;
program, which is strongly encouraged, and politicization of the program. Politicization occurs&#13;
when transparency breaks down, which can happen if information about the project is not widely&#13;
and carefully disseminated, or when project internal controls are not enforced, such as with weak&#13;
supervision by the TUs or insufficient external support from NGOs or other third parties to&#13;
rnonitor project implementation. As municipalities increase their contributions to the financing of&#13;
NRDP investments, greater vigilance will be required to ensure that the demand-driven nature of&#13;
the project is not sacrificed. Also, the FUMAC approach which instills greater transparency into&#13;
the program's resource allocation process can fall prey to political interference if community&#13;
representation on the Councils is insufficient. In addition, where technical assistance and training&#13;
i's inadequate, sustainability of the investments is more precarious since operation and maintenance&#13;
of the investments requires certain skill sets which may not exist in some communities. Increased&#13;
"on the job" training to community associations is vital to ensure their sustainability, particularly&#13;
of newly-formed associations.&#13;
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
36.   The generally satisfactory performance of the reformulated NRDP and its favorable impact&#13;
on the lives and incomes of beneficiaries show that after several years of experience with rural&#13;
development efforts in the Northeast, a good measure of success has been achieved in effectively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -                       Annex B&#13;
reaching the rural poor with targeted interventions. Some of the most positive results can be&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
* The reformulated NRDP has put in place objective conditions for the organization of&#13;
poor communities in the ten participating states. In some of these states, organized&#13;
rural communities have shown that they can influence the allocation and use of&#13;
municipal financial resources in such a way as to favor the rural poor.&#13;
* The program has fostered the institutional and financial commitment of local&#13;
governments to its decentralized approach of addressing the needs of the rural poor.&#13;
A large number of municipalities, although not legally required either under PAC or&#13;
FUMAC, have provided financial and other types of assistance to approved&#13;
community projects. In addition, in some states, mayors have adopted the FUMAC&#13;
approach and instituted it for decision-making on non-project investments at the&#13;
municipal level.&#13;
*  Investments funded by the program have, to a large extent, (i) satisfied real&#13;
community needs; (ii) been of good or satisfactory quality and (iii) been relatively less&#13;
costly than those executed by public authorities (municipal, state and federal).&#13;
-  Beneficiary communities have adhered enthusiastically to the program; such&#13;
enthusiasm has translated into participation in the execution and in contributing to the&#13;
costs of operation and maintenance of the investments, enhancing their sense of&#13;
ownership of the subprojects.&#13;
-  Although the reformulated program does not incorporate instruments for structural&#13;
changes in the agricuiture of the Northeast, it has proven to be a valuable approach&#13;
for reaching and assisting a large number of landless families -- usually excluded from&#13;
the target groups of many other programs, including the original NRDP. Further,&#13;
land reform beneficiaries have become a very active clientele of the reformulated&#13;
program, as it provides them with opportunities to satisfy investment needs other than&#13;
those received through the government's land reform program.&#13;
* In the majority of FUMAC participating municipalities, there are encouraging signs&#13;
that the "clientelistic" approach traditionally used in the Northeast to satisfy&#13;
community needs is gradually giving way to a more genuinely participatory and&#13;
transparent approach. This transparency in decision-making has allowed a built-in&#13;
mechanism of "social control" over investments made with public funds.&#13;
37.   Nevertheless, the program could be further improved by introducing modifications to its&#13;
design, which would rectify those deficiencies that have been identified and would improve&#13;
project implementation and performance. The specific evaluation carried out in the state of&#13;
Pemambuco shows that the reformulated NRDP has raised the living standards and incomes of&#13;
beneficiaries in this state, significantly in certain cases as demonstrated by the financial and&#13;
economic results obtained by some of the sample productive subprojects (Table 8). In a number&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -                       Annex B&#13;
of subprojects surveyed, however, and in particular those implemented at the start of&#13;
reformulation (late 1993-early 1994), under the previous state administration, a number of&#13;
institutional and operational shortcomings were detected: lack of beneficiaries' contribution and&#13;
participation, insufficient field supervision and monitoring by the TU, and inadequate provision of&#13;
technical assistance. Conscious of these problems, the TU has made serious efforts to correct the&#13;
course of these "problem" subprojects through the strengthening of subproject supervision,&#13;
appropriate technical assistance and training to Municipal Councils and to beneficiary associations&#13;
in operation and maintenance and revision and adjustment of faulty subproject design, where&#13;
necessary. These efforts would have to be pursued and the identified flaws corrected in the&#13;
follow-up project for the state.&#13;
:38.   Proposed modifications to the design of follow-up projects to the NRDP stemming from&#13;
these lessons, and others derived from the evaluations of the program, are as follows:&#13;
:39.   Expand FUMAC. The projects should expand FUMAC and initiate a pilot municipal&#13;
fiunds program (FUMAC-P), to promote further decentralization of decision-making to municipal&#13;
and community levels, to relieve the administrative logjam resulting from state intervention in the&#13;
minutiae of subprojects, and to further encourage municipal cost-sharing of subprojects. The&#13;
appraisal and subsequent approval of community subprojects by Municipal Councils under&#13;
IFUMAC and FUMAC-P would significantly reduce the role played by TUs in approving&#13;
subprojects --and the bias that this implies-- in the existing program. Also, FIJMAC tends to be&#13;
more effective in thwarting political interference because of the increased transparency of its&#13;
subproject approval process over that of PAC. Increasing community representation on the&#13;
Councils to at least 80% of all voting members will help Councils resist overpowering political&#13;
influence.&#13;
40.   Supervision. By the same token, supervision of subprojects by the TUs should be more&#13;
rigorous, including by contracting external assistance as in Rio Grande do Norte where FETARN&#13;
was contracted for this purpose. Supervision, both during and after implementation of the&#13;
subprojects, is an indispensable determinant of their success and sustainability. Increased supervision&#13;
would improve the quality of implementation of subprojects and would help identify and resolve&#13;
potential problems in subproject operation and subsequent maintenance.&#13;
41.   Standard Designs and Appraisal Criteria. For simplicity and efficiency in subproject&#13;
preparation, evaluation and supervision, as well as for minimizing design deficiencies, the Project&#13;
Operational Manuals should establish standard engineering designs, technical and financial&#13;
parameters, and cost indicators for the most frequently requested subprojects. Standardization of&#13;
subproject documents, technical designs and unit costs simplifies the subproject preparation and&#13;
evaluation process, facilitates the procurement of goods and works, prevents overdesign and improves&#13;
the quality of subprojects, encouraging greater participation by poorer communities and reducing&#13;
bottlenecks in the subproject cycle. Also, environmental assessment criteria should be part of the&#13;
Operational Manual and routinely monitored during subproject supervision.&#13;
42.   Technical Assistance and Training. Funds for technical assistance and training should&#13;
be channeled to rural communities and project Municipal Councils to enable participation of the&#13;
poorest areas, foster community capacity and empowerment, and encourage the active&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59 -                         Annex B&#13;
participation of able and competent NGOs and local development agencies. ][ncreased technical&#13;
assistance to rural communities also will enable them to identify, prepare and implement their own&#13;
subprojects, thereby augmenting their capacity to compete for investment funds and to operate and&#13;
maintain the subprojects appropriately. In addition, technical assistance activities should be targeted to&#13;
project Municipal Councils to improve their planning, management and financial capacity. Finally, the&#13;
quality and capacity of the Technical Unit is a critical factor in project success, and thus its institutional&#13;
strengthening, which may entail the contracting of international or bilateral aid-funded entities such as&#13;
IICA or GTZ, as is currently practiced, should receive increased attention. The TUs should actively&#13;
organize all technical assistance and training arrangements under the project and oversee the&#13;
quality of said activities.&#13;
43.   Participation and Transparency. In addition to the above measures, participation and&#13;
transparency should be further enhanced by setting clear rules for the composition and modus&#13;
operandi of project Municipal Councils, with more than 80% of members coming from&#13;
community representatives and the local civil society. In addition, greater efforts by the TU to&#13;
organize and mobilize poor communities are fundamental in orcler to enable these communities to&#13;
participate in the benefits of the project.&#13;
44.   Transparency also should be promoted by incorporating a system of operational incentives&#13;
and penalties into the project design. Incentives for positive performance and penalties against&#13;
departures from project guidelines --misappropriation of resources, mistargeting of project&#13;
benefits, faulty subproject design, insufficient comrnunity participation or lack of proper O&amp;M--&#13;
should accompany the increased decentralization of resources and decision-making responsibilities&#13;
to beneficiaries and project Municipal Councils through FUMAC and FUMAC-P. This&#13;
framework of incentives and disincentives would require backing by the TUs through ex-post&#13;
control of subproject activities through auditing of accounts, and supervision and monitoring.&#13;
45.   Finally, to minimize the risk of political manipulation and increase participation, the ten&#13;
states must better tailor their information campaigns to the rural poor and ensure that information&#13;
about the project, particularly its objectives, operational guidelines and procedures for soliciting&#13;
financing, is widely disseminated to all potential beneficiaries. Better and more widely&#13;
disseminated information campaigns will also increase transparency -- stimulating the role of&#13;
public "watchdogs" -- and will put all communities on a level playing field with respect to access&#13;
to project benefits.&#13;
46.   Sustainability. Through a system of matching grants to poor rural community associations,&#13;
the reformulated NRDP is improving the quality of life and the economic and social conditions of its&#13;
beneficiaries. By providing an initial jump-start to poor communities previously without investment&#13;
capital, the reformulated NRDP has initiated a process of local accumulation at the beneficiary and&#13;
community levels and laid the groundwork for sustainable local development. This sustainable local&#13;
development will be further encouraged through greater financial participation of municipal&#13;
governments in subproject investments, a process already underway in the ongoing projects but which&#13;
should be expanded. Sustainability ofthe subproject investments themselves also has greater potential&#13;
when the municipalities and communities contribute to the subproject financing in a cost-sharing&#13;
arrangement and when there is increased beneficiary participation. Beneficiary counterpart&#13;
contributions should be better quantified and should count toward the global counterpart fund&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                        Annex B&#13;
requirements. Furthermore, increased technical assistance and training to rural communities as&#13;
well as stronger supervision by the TUs will improve the quality of implementation of subprojects&#13;
and stem potential problems in subproject operation and maintenance, which can impede&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
47.   Cost Sharing and Graduation. A strategy should be formalized to graduate&#13;
municipalities and communities from the program, once a certain level of accumulated benefits has&#13;
been reached. A fundamental element of a feasible graduation strategy would be the criteria&#13;
adopted to determine the point of graduation, backed by appropriate data which can be collected&#13;
to implement such a strategy. The strategy would need to carefully consider beneficiaries' access&#13;
to credit as well as monitorable indicators of income levels and local capacity to manage funds, as&#13;
would be demonstrated through mastery of the FUMAC-P approach.&#13;
48.   Monitoring and Evaluation. A user-friendly monitoring and evaluation system facilitates&#13;
the subproject evaluation process, provides feedback and necessary information to improve targeting&#13;
and efficiency, and serves as an effective management and planning tool. To bolster the measurement&#13;
of overall project impact, the monitoring and evaluation system would need to expand the range of&#13;
project impact indicators and performance benchmarks. Examples include: increased employment for&#13;
women; improved health and related "savings" to State/municipal budgets; resource mobilization at the&#13;
local/municipal level; and indicators of migration. In addition, as mentioned above, the project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system must be geared to collect the information necessary to support a&#13;
graduation strategy. Therefore, as a condition of loan effectiveness, the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
system of the projects should be improved to reinforce the mechanisms for targeting and to secure&#13;
reliable data for evaluating subproject impact, as well as to facilitate better control and project&#13;
nmanagement throughout the subproject cycle by the TUs.&#13;
49.   "Best Practice" Exchanges. Across the ten states of the reformulated NRDP, there exist&#13;
numerous successful interventions that could be replicated to the benefit of the whole program,&#13;
such as the experience with EMATER in Minas Gerais or with NGOs in Rio Grande do Norte. In&#13;
addition, certain states have adopted technical parameters or have developed training materials&#13;
which have produced positive results and should be disseminated throughout the program. Thus,&#13;
"best practice" exchanges should be arranged among the TUs to share successful experiences and&#13;
tc, reward innovation. More importantly, at the state level, community associations with&#13;
successful subprojects or possessing certain skills should also be encouraged to share these with&#13;
other associations through training seminars and workshops.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT -&#13;
PERNAMBUCO&#13;
C. TARGETING MECHANISMS AND PROJECT&#13;
MUNICIPALITIES&#13;
1.    Targeting of the rural poor is of critical importance in the project particularly as&#13;
justification for the use of grants for subproject financing. Under the project, it is&#13;
proposed that targeting occur at three levels:&#13;
(a)   geographically by poverty level and other characteristics of the&#13;
municipalities;&#13;
(b)   geographically within municipalities to target rural settlements and&#13;
communities; and,&#13;
(c)   community-based selection of poor beneficiaries and particularly&#13;
vulnerable groups by the project Municipal Councils.&#13;
2.    Municipalities. Targeting at the first and second levels defines the project area.&#13;
All municipalities, with the exception of the metropolitan area of Recife', are included in&#13;
the project area, bringing the total project municipalities to 180, including 8 new&#13;
municipalities to be created as of January 1, 199, through the subdivision of existing&#13;
municipalities. Targeting of these municipalities takes into consideration the concentration&#13;
of income and economic activity in the metropolitan area and the higher incidence of&#13;
poverty in the municipalities of the interior, manifested by such indicators as the rate of&#13;
indigence2, availability of municipal resources, and other socio-economic indicators (see&#13;
Table). According to IPEA (1993), 89% of the project municipalities suffer a rate of&#13;
indigence greater than 40%, and 37% have an indigence rate greater than 50%. In&#13;
The metropolitan area of Recife comprises the municipalities of Jaboatao, Olinda, Paulista and&#13;
Recife.&#13;
Rate of indigence equals the number of families below the official poverty line established by&#13;
IPEA divided by the total number of families in the municipality. See 0 Mapa da Fome, IPEA,&#13;
March 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71-                            Annex C&#13;
addition, since rural poverty in Pemambuco is closely correlated with the poor natural&#13;
resource base, the harsh agro-climatic conditions and concentration of land ownership, the&#13;
project area includes the entire semi-arid region of the state (90% of the state falls within&#13;
the "drought polygon") and includes the area currently assisted by the reformulated&#13;
NRDP, characterized as small farm areas, both in the semi-arid region and more humid&#13;
Mata Atldntica region (para. 1.17) with primarily smallholdlers, sharecroppers and wage&#13;
workers, who depend on a diverse strategy of income-generating activities in which the&#13;
subsistence production of maize, beans, manioc and rice, and small livestock&#13;
predorrinates.&#13;
3 .    Within the project municipalities, the selection of PAC and FUMAC municipalities&#13;
will be based on criteria such as past performance under the reformulated NRDP,&#13;
estimation of the organizational capacity of communities within the municipality, and&#13;
"progressiveness" of the mayor and municipal administration. The criteria for selection of&#13;
FUMAC-P municipalities is included in Annex F. As an incentive and basis for a&#13;
reasonable rate of development for FUMAC and FUMAC-P Councils, a minimum of 5&#13;
subprojects would be financed annually for each of these Councils. Adopting this rule and&#13;
based on the average unit cost of NRDP subprojects in Pernambuco , amounts initially&#13;
allocated to the two subcomponents would permit the establishment of 60 FUMAC&#13;
Councils and 10 FUMAC-P Councils during the project period.&#13;
4.    Rural Settlements and Communities. The second level of targeting, that within&#13;
municipalities, focuses on rural settlements and communities. Beneficiary settlements or&#13;
communities are limited to those with a population under 7,'500 people.&#13;
5.    Community-based Selection. The third and principal level of targeting is&#13;
community-based selection. The project assumes that local communities can best judge&#13;
which community groups are poor and what investment priorities are in each municipality&#13;
and/or each community. The process of consensus-building at the local level by project&#13;
Municipal Councils helps to ensure that only poor communities benefit from the project.&#13;
During the open meetings to set priorities, criteria such as the socio-economic situation of&#13;
the participating communities, including existing infrastructure and availability of services,&#13;
would be discussed as part of the ranking of subprojects within the municipality. The&#13;
composition of the Municipal Councils, in which 80% are representatives from rural&#13;
communities and local civil society, as well as the clear and transparent rules and&#13;
procedures for the Councils' functioning, are important elements which facilitate targeting&#13;
poor beneficiaries. Finally, indicative targets set for social subprojects and those which&#13;
benefit women in particular, should be considered by the PMunicipal Councils as criteria for&#13;
subproject selection, insofar as the principles of need and perceived benefits guide ranking&#13;
decisions.&#13;
6.    The effectiveness of the targeting methodology would be assessed through the&#13;
project monitoring system and though ex-post evaluation studies. For example, annual&#13;
physical performance reviews (Annex H) would monitor the targeting of project benefits.&#13;
Also, the project implementation review (Annex H) would measure the ability of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -                          Annex C&#13;
project to target and reach the poor. Adjustments and fine-tuning of the targeting&#13;
methodology would be based on these ex-post reviews, in agreement with the Bank.&#13;
GRADUATION STRATEGY&#13;
7.    The demand-driven community development model presented in the proposed&#13;
project is expected to increase the income-generating capacity and standards of living in&#13;
the beneficiary communities. Because project resources will be targeted to the poorest&#13;
rural communities, certain communities with better socio-economic standing relative to&#13;
others would receive fewer investment resources during the course of project&#13;
implementation. These communities, able to leverage a critical mass of subprojects and&#13;
other benefits from this and previous Bank-financed and other projects, would gain access&#13;
to other sources of financing and reach a point where a "safety net" is no longer necessary.&#13;
In order to formalize this process, the proposed project would introduce a community&#13;
graduation strategy whereby those communities with demonstrated capacity for&#13;
sustainable asset-accumulation (savings), adequate social and economic infrastructure and&#13;
community organization, would no longer be eligible for project matching grants.&#13;
8.    To make this judgment, baseline profiles of beneficiary communities would be&#13;
developed using indicators of community well-being collected from community subproject&#13;
proposals. Each subproject proposal would be accompanied by a 'fact sheet' to be filled&#13;
out by the community which would provide indication of the community's socio-economic&#13;
standing. The questions asked would extract information on benefits from previous&#13;
subprojects as well as from NRDP and other public programs, existing infrastructure and&#13;
access to social services, and indicators of accumulation/savings, such as: (a) the average&#13;
income of families in the community, in terms of minimum wages; (b) the average portion&#13;
of this income which families dedicate to buy food; (c) the average portion of family&#13;
income dedicated to buying medicines; and (d) the percentage of community households&#13;
which have electricity, which have secure access to water and/or treated water, and which&#13;
have access to a health post. The information contained in the baseline community profiles&#13;
would be incorporated in the MIS, and regularly updated through monitoring and&#13;
supervision exercises.&#13;
9.    At the end of the second year, the project would finance a study to determine the&#13;
point at which a community would be charged a higher cost-sharing percentage as well as&#13;
the "take-off' point, the point at which a community would graduate out of the project.&#13;
The study would be based on a comparison of community profiles and on information&#13;
from the baseline impact evaluation (see Annex H). Using this analysis, PRORURAL (for&#13;
PAC) and the Municipal Councils (for FUMAC and FUMAC-P), with the support of&#13;
PRORURAL, would graduate those communities which have reached this "take-off'&#13;
point. As communities graduate, those municipalities with fewer eligible communities&#13;
would gradually receive less funding for subprojects and, concurrently, would graduate&#13;
from the project as well.&#13;

D. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1.    The success of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Project in Pernambuco in meeting its&#13;
stated objectives depends primarily on the strength of four organizations: (a) community&#13;
organizations; (b) Municipal Councils; (c) the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU); and (d)&#13;
participating governmental and non-governmental agencies.&#13;
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS&#13;
2.    Community associations are the legitimate represerLtatives of the beneficiaries&#13;
before the Municipal Councils and the State under the project, and the project will only&#13;
benefit those communities organized into legally-constituted civil associations. This&#13;
prerequisite helps ensure that the project meets the needs of a representative group from a&#13;
given community and not simply the needs of its more vocal or politically influential&#13;
constituents. Due to the rather cumbersome legal process in Brazil for forming&#13;
associations, the project only requires that the association be legally constituted once the&#13;
subproject proposal has been approved.&#13;
3.    Under Brazilian law, the leadership of community associations consists of the&#13;
Executive Board of Directors, the General Assembly and lhe Fiscal Council. The&#13;
Executive Board of Directors comprises the President, Secretary, and T'reasurer and the&#13;
Coordinators of any special working groups within the Association. These fixed-term&#13;
positions are filled by the vote of the General Assembly which meets regularly every three&#13;
months to discuss and vote on the Association's work program and internal procedures.&#13;
All decisions made by the General Assembly are registered in official documents (atas)&#13;
and signed by all members present. This procedure is reflected in the identification and&#13;
prioritization of subprojects: a subproject proposal addresses the needs of a majority of&#13;
the association, as voted by its members, and therefore is accompanied by an ata signed by&#13;
the association members. The fiscal council, normally cornposed of three members,&#13;
supervises all of the association's activities and functions as internal auditor of all financial&#13;
transactions made by the association. The principal source of resources for most&#13;
associations is monthly dues paid by members.&#13;
4.    Community associations are the foundation of project implementation. The&#13;
associations are responsible for formulating ideas for subprojects and submitting these&#13;
proposals to the Municipal Councils or PCU for financing. The General Assembly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -                          Annex D&#13;
deliberates and votes on each subproject proposal thereby ensuring that these subprojects&#13;
attend to the needs of the majority of the association members. The signed ata which&#13;
accompanies each subproject proposal attests to the association's commitment to the&#13;
subproject. Once a subproject has been approved, the community association enters into a&#13;
legally binding agreement with the PCU and/or Municipal Council through which the&#13;
funds to implement the subproject are passed to the association. The association, in most&#13;
cases, is responsible for all procurement and record-keeping during the implementation of&#13;
the subproject. This agreement also binds the association to provide the necessary&#13;
counterpart contribution to implement the subproject (which can include labor, materials&#13;
or cash) and the future operation and maintenance of the subproject, which in the case of&#13;
certain infrastructure projects the association can transfer to appropriate public sector&#13;
agencies (e.g., the electricity company, for rural electrification subprojects).&#13;
5.    Implementation of subprojects therefore implies significant responsibility for the&#13;
community associations and the communities which they represent, and is a source of&#13;
empowerment for them. Charging the communities with the primary responsibility for the&#13;
implementation of their own subprojects assures better quality and reinforces their sense of&#13;
ownership. The supervision and administration of the subprojects is carried out by an&#13;
elected Supervision and Control Committee, which oversees the subproject from start to&#13;
finish and reports back to the association on progress. This Committee of 3 to 4 persons&#13;
is comprised of subproject beneficiaries, both members of the association and non-&#13;
members within the community. The members of the Committee are elected by the&#13;
beneficiaries-at-large and are recognized as having some experience or knowledge in the&#13;
area of the proposed subproject. The Committee visits the subproject regularly and&#13;
monitors subproject implementation, costs, procurement, and community contribution, as&#13;
well as any potential problems.. The Supervision and Control Committee therefore acts as&#13;
a "'community watchdog" to ensure that subproject funds and the community's&#13;
contribution are invested in accordance with the subproject agreement and that the&#13;
investment is of a high quality.&#13;
MUNICIPAL COUNCILS&#13;
6.    Under the proposed project, FllMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils may be&#13;
formed as legally-constituted civil organizations or may be established through Municipal&#13;
decree. In the latter case, the Council must nonetheless be granted administrative and&#13;
financial autonomy from the local municipal government. The size of the Municipal&#13;
Councils will vary across municipalities (usually between 10 and 15 members) and their&#13;
profile will be representative of the beneficiary communities. 80% of the voting power of&#13;
the Council is granted to representatives of community associations and of local civil&#13;
society, such as NGOs, labor unions and religious organizations. The remaining 20%&#13;
represent Municipal Government and other public institutions such as EMATER. The&#13;
PCU has a seat on the Council with the right to voice but not vote. Members of the&#13;
Council are elected for one-year terms (which can be renewed once) by a community&#13;
assembly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                          Annex D&#13;
7.    While the Municipal Councils act independently of the Municipal IGovernment, the&#13;
participation and support of the latter is nonetheless quite important. Experience under&#13;
the reformulated NRDP has demonstrated that the mayors and municipal leadership&#13;
welcome the project Municipal Councils as an instrument to meet basic community needs&#13;
to which their municipal budgets cannot realistically attend. The participation of the&#13;
mayor is fundamental in creating a synergy between the priorities of the Council and the&#13;
Municipal Government's investment program. In this sense, the project Municipal&#13;
Council is not seen as a parallel institution to Municipal Government but as a counterpart.&#13;
8.    Municipal Councils are the key organization for the targeting of project benefits&#13;
and the allocation of resources under the proposed project. The Councils have a&#13;
fundamental role in mobilizing communities and fomenting community participation in&#13;
decision-making at the municipal level. By their nature as open, representative and&#13;
democratic bodies which build consensus on priorities, the Municipal Councils instill&#13;
transparency into the decision-making process for FUMAC and FUMAC-P investments.&#13;
The Councils receive, prioritize and approve subproject pro-posals from the beneficiary&#13;
associations. The monthly meetings of the Municipal Councils are widely publicized and&#13;
the public is encouraged to attend them. At these meetings, the beneficiary associations&#13;
present their subproject ideas to the Council. The Council cdeliberates and prioritizes the&#13;
subproject proposals based on its determination of the needs of the different communities,&#13;
and on criteria such as the level of poverty and the existing infrastructure of each&#13;
community in relation to the rest of the municipality; the type of subproject to be financed&#13;
and its potential to improve the life quality of the beneficiary population; and the&#13;
demonstrated participation of the beneficiary community in the identification of the&#13;
subproject and its commitment to the implementation and subsequent operation and&#13;
maintenance of the subproject. The Municipal Councils' pri.oritization process is the basis&#13;
of targeting in the project since the communities themselves through the Councils&#13;
determine where project resources will best be applied based on their first-hand&#13;
knowledge of local investment needs. The Council ranks the subprojects in priority order&#13;
based on the vote of the Council members. The subproject approval process is based on&#13;
technical and eligibility criteria. The Municipal Council screens the FUMAC/FUMAC-P&#13;
subprojects based on pre-established technical, environmental and cost/financial standards&#13;
(see Annex G) and either approves or rejects the proposals. Rejected subprojects are&#13;
returned to the beneficiary association with recommendations to improve the proposal.&#13;
Decisions for approval or rejection of subproject proposals are also determined by vote.&#13;
Approved subprojects are either sent by FUMAC Councils to the PCU in order of priority&#13;
for financing or, in the case of FUMAC-P, financed directly by the relevant Councils.&#13;
9.    A FUMAC-P Council bases its investment decisions on an Annual Operating Plan&#13;
(POA), developed with the assistance of the PCU at the start of every fiscal year. This&#13;
POA, which is voted on by Council members after detailed deliberations, establishes the&#13;
development priorities of the municipality to be addressed with project resources. Based&#13;
on the POA, the PCU transfers the allotted budget to the Council who, on the basis of&#13;
subprojects approved, will transfer the resources to the beneficiary associations on the&#13;
basis of signed, legal agreements. This concept of approving subprojects within a budget&#13;
envelope enhances the Council's capacity to program and prioritize investments. If, on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                          Annex D&#13;
the other hand, the Council's performance is unsatisfactory, it will run the risk of seeing its&#13;
budget envelope reduced the following year.&#13;
10.   Municipal Councils also supervise the implementation of subprojects in the&#13;
communities and work closely with the Community Control and Supervision Committee in&#13;
this respect. The Councils are well placed to provide this assistance. Given their&#13;
proximity to the communities and their lines of communication both with the PCU and&#13;
with the communities themselves, Municipal Councils are effective trouble-shooters for&#13;
subproject implementation problems.&#13;
PROJECT COORDINATING UNIT&#13;
11.   The PCU is the focal point for project administration and for communication with&#13;
the Bank and the State Government. It is also the project's principal liaison for the&#13;
Municipal Councils and for those community associations located in PAC municipalities.&#13;
In Pernambuco, the PCU is PRORURAL, an entity under the State Secretariat of Planning&#13;
(see Organizational Chart at the end of this annex). Under the proposed project,&#13;
PRORURAL will shed some of its executive responsibilities that it held under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP and increase its monitoring, technical assistance and supervision&#13;
responsibilities. It will promote decentralization and community participation in the&#13;
project by delegating tasks to Municipal Councils and participating state and non-&#13;
governmental organizations.&#13;
12.   The organizational structure of PRORURAL reflects its new role of advancing&#13;
project implementation rather than direct execution of project tasks. PRORURAL is in&#13;
the process of restructuring to strengthen its field presence and will establish ten regional&#13;
offices with at least three technical staff, in function of the demand presented, in addition&#13;
to its headquarters in Recife. Under this new structure, the Executive Director and three&#13;
Department Directors (Planning, Operations, and Administration and Finance) would be&#13;
supported by 8 section chiefs and about 80 professional staff, of which at least 30 would&#13;
be located in the field, and corresponding administrative staff. This increased field&#13;
presence reflects the PCU's focus on monitoring and supervision and will provide needed&#13;
additional support to Municipal Councils who, together with contracted NGOs, will take&#13;
over the majority of PRORURAL's field supervision and trouble-shooting tasks.&#13;
PRORURAL's principal tasks under the project will include: (i) project planning and&#13;
coordination at the state level through the preparation of POAs, including the&#13;
consolidation of POAs by FUMAC-P Councils, and monitoring activities through&#13;
maintenance of the project's Management Information System (MIS); (ii) promoting the&#13;
project and encouraging participation of potential beneficiary communities, NGOs and&#13;
private sector entities; (iii) preparing project implementation reports and organizing&#13;
evaluation exercises; (iv) ensuring timely and adequate provision of loan and state&#13;
counterpart funds; (v) appraising and approving all PAC subproject proposals; (vi)&#13;
entering into subproject agreements with community associations (PAC) and Municipal&#13;
Councils (FUMAC) and into POA-based agreements with FUMAC-P Municipal Councils,&#13;
to transfer subproject funds and monitor their use; (vii) overseeing all monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-77-                            Annex D&#13;
supervision activities under the project to gauge compliance with project guidelines and to&#13;
improve the quality of subprojects and project interventions, ensuring that environmental&#13;
guidelines for subproject approval and implementation are followed; (viii) providing&#13;
technical assistance to the FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils; (ix) preparing&#13;
statements of expenditure (SOEs) and applications for reimbursement; and (x) ensuring&#13;
that procurement, disbursement and auditing procedures applicable to the Bank loan are&#13;
followed. To increase PRORURAL's capacity to undertake some of these tasks,&#13;
particularly with respect to stimulating the mobilization and organization of communities&#13;
and providing technical assistance to them, training in specific areas will be organized for&#13;
PRORURAL staff under the institutional development component of the project (para.&#13;
15). In the area of environmental impact assessment, PRORURAL will be provided&#13;
training as well as assistance from specialized state agencies such as the Environmental&#13;
Secretariat (SMA) and the Water Resources Council (CPRH:).&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY&#13;
13.   The project, through the community subproject methodology, is expected to lay&#13;
the groundwork for, and consolidate, participatory institutions and processes at the&#13;
municipal and community levels. Formed into community associations, the rural&#13;
population is gaining a voice and a role in political participation which it did not have as&#13;
individuals. When communities organizes themselves to receive benefits from the project,&#13;
and then contribute to and operate and maintain the investments, this sense of ownership&#13;
of the investments empowers the communities and their organization and commitment are&#13;
being rewarded. When this level of organization is apparent at the municipal level, and the&#13;
official municipal leadership supports participatory decision-making, the municipality&#13;
enters FUMAC. The project Municipal Council in FUMAC formalizes the communities'&#13;
voice in the establishment of investment priorities at the municipal level. FUMAC also&#13;
forges a partnership between the communities and municipal leadership as both groups&#13;
contribute to the financing of investments, thus leveraging project funds. As Municipal&#13;
Councils gain experience and capacity, progressing from FUMAC to FUMAC-P, they&#13;
increase their bearing and influence on public resource programming at the municipal level&#13;
while also reinforcing a sustainable participatory process. In Serra do Mel, for example, a&#13;
highly organized municipality in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte where the&#13;
FUMAC program has operated with great success, members of the Municipal Council&#13;
declared that the participatory process engendered by FUMAC had become so ingrained&#13;
in the public decision-making process that changes in municipal administration could not&#13;
undermine it, but only support it.&#13;
14.  Implementation capacity is central to the successful performance of the community&#13;
subprojects subcomponent and, hence, of the project's development objectives. The&#13;
implementation capacity of the various institutions participating in the project --&#13;
beneficiary associations, Municipal Councils, public and non-governmental agencies, and&#13;
PRORURAL -- is specifically addressed by the institutional development subcomponent.&#13;
This subcomponent provides resources to finance appropriate technical assistance and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -                            Annex D&#13;
training in order that each group acquire the capabilities needed to effectively perform its&#13;
functions under the project (for operational details, see Annex E).&#13;
15.   The institutional development component will give community associations access&#13;
to funds for community mobilization and organizational strengthening. Beneficiary&#13;
associations will also have access to expertise on subproject preparation and execution, as&#13;
well as training in operation and maintenance techniques to derive optimal benefit from&#13;
subproject investments. By providing training in financial administration, the project will&#13;
also prepare these groups to manage productive activities which open doors for future&#13;
income-generating endeavors. To fully develop their potential leadership role at the&#13;
municipal level and to fulfill their role within the project, Municipal Councils will require&#13;
assistance to orient their decision-making on resource allocation among community&#13;
investments and, in the FUMAC-P program, to develop their capacity for investment&#13;
planning and financial administration. Municipal Councils will also themselves serve as a&#13;
source of technical advice for comrnunity associations. PRORURAL, in its refined role as&#13;
project facilitator, will require training to master effective monitoring and supervision&#13;
techniques as well as enhanced project management and other skills. Where PRORURAL&#13;
subcontracts its responsibilities to NGOs or other state agencies, these institutions may&#13;
also receive specific training under the project. Also, because the fiscal situation of the&#13;
State affects both project implementation and state counterpart funding, technical&#13;
assistance at the state level is needed to analyze issues surrounding the reform of the State&#13;
and to identify measures to improve the State's capacity to address the inherent causes of&#13;
its fiscal deficit situation.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT -&#13;
PERNAMBUCO&#13;
E. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, TRAINING AND&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY-BUILDING&#13;
1.    Technical assistance and training are fundamental inputs into the subproject cycle&#13;
and overall project implementation. Evaluations of the reformulated NRDP highlight the&#13;
importance of technical assistance and training to community associations, project&#13;
Municipal Councils and Project Coordinating Units (PCUs), in order to ensure higher&#13;
quality planning and implementation and greater sustainability of subprojects and to&#13;
augment the development impact of the project. Under the proposed Pemambuco Rural&#13;
Poverty Alleviation project, technical assistance would be provided in two forms: (a) the&#13;
Institutional Development component; and (b) a percentage of subproject cost targeted to&#13;
technical assistance. Details on the operational aspects for the provision of technical&#13;
assistance are included in the project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.    The Institutional Development Component. The Institutional Development&#13;
component is an important resource for the strengthening of PRORURAL, Municipal&#13;
Councils and community associations. This component directs technical assistance and&#13;
training, primarily community mobilization and preparation assistance, to Municipal&#13;
Councils and community associations. Since the component is not tied to the subproject&#13;
cycle, communities and Municipal Councils can receive assistance independent of whether&#13;
they have an approved subproject or approved portfolio of subprojects, respectively. The&#13;
resources of the Institutional Development component would finance a variety of&#13;
capacity-building programs, such as:&#13;
(a)   Mobilization assistance to beneficiary associations: PRORURAL (for&#13;
PAC) and Municipal Councils (for FUTMAC and FUMAC-P) would&#13;
formulate and fund strategies to extend mobilization assistance to those&#13;
communities lacking in organization and thus not initially in a position to&#13;
benefit from the project. Such assistance would include community&#13;
workshops to determine priority needs, training to community groups in&#13;
organization skills and helping them with the process of forming legal&#13;
associations, etc.;&#13;
(b)   Introductory Municipal Council training program: PRORURAL would&#13;
organize this program which would train FUMAC Municipal Councils on&#13;
the project philosophy, subproject cycle and Operational Manual&#13;
guidelines, and FUMAC-P Councils on budgeting and administration;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -                           Annex E&#13;
(c)    Specialized skills training: PRORURAL, the project Councils, and groups&#13;
of community associations, would receive, on a demand basis, practical&#13;
"on-the-job training" in areas such as monitoring techniques, financial&#13;
administration, as well as specific technical topics in support of subproject&#13;
implementation and operation and maintenance (e.g., for groups of&#13;
community associations on water use);&#13;
(d)   Standard subproject design training: standardized projects will reduce the&#13;
need for intensive technical assistance in subp:roject preparation for the&#13;
majority of subproject types requested. The standard subproject models&#13;
are especially helpful to communities lacking experience in subproject&#13;
preparation. Workshops organized at the municipal level with Municipal&#13;
Councils and community leaders would provide technical assistance in the&#13;
use of standard subprojects;&#13;
(e)   "Best Practice" exchanges: PRORURAL and Municipal Councils would&#13;
finance technical exchanges among community associations with similar&#13;
subprojects. These exchanges have proven to be an effective way to&#13;
transfer know-how on subproject operation and maintenance from&#13;
community associations with successful subprojects to associations&#13;
initiating new subprojects. In addition, exchanges among Municipal&#13;
Councils within the state and among PCUs throughout the Northeast could&#13;
be financed to disseminate successful experiences across states; and&#13;
(f)    Technical assistance for State reform. Because the fiscal situation of the&#13;
State affects both project implementation and state counterpart funding,&#13;
technical assistance at the state level is needecl to analyze issues&#13;
surrounding the reform of the State and to identify measures to improve&#13;
the State's capacity to overcome fiscal crisis and address its underlying&#13;
causes. The Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN), through PRORURAL,&#13;
will have access to technical assistance funds .For consultant services and&#13;
studies required for administrative and other state reforms.&#13;
3.    For access to funds from the Institutional Development component., PRORURAL&#13;
and each Municipal Council would prepare, as part of the Annual Operating Plan (POA), a&#13;
technical assistance and training proposal indicating proposed beneficiaries (by type),&#13;
numbers of activities (e.g., events, consultants, etc.), expected subject matter and&#13;
estimated costs. The aggregate dollar amount of technical assistance included in each&#13;
proposal would be based on a series of parameters, such as the number of subprojects&#13;
expected, the estimated number of new Municipal Councils, the estimated number of&#13;
communities needing mobilization assistance or general technical support, etc. During the&#13;
course of the year, each actual technical assistance and training event would require&#13;
detailed terms of reference, outlining the objective and contents of each event.&#13;
PRORURAL would provide the Municipal Councils with a framework for the annual&#13;
technical assistance and training proposals and with model terms of reference to facilitate&#13;
their access to Institutional Development funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-82 -                           Annex E&#13;
4.    Types of contracts under the Institutional Development component would range&#13;
from short-term contracts for single training events, to longer-term retainer contracts for a&#13;
series of training or technical assistance activities to be performed over a period of time.&#13;
For example, Municipal Councils may contract the services of a local extension agent to&#13;
follow-up and provide technical assistance to all community subprojects within the&#13;
municipality. Also, training in basic accounting and recordkeeping may be needed by a&#13;
number of community associations with productive subprojects and would best be handled&#13;
by having PRORURAL contract a specialized NGO to conduct in situ training with&#13;
various community associations over a period of a year. The flexibility of contract types&#13;
reflects the diversity of technical assistance and training needs of the various entities&#13;
participating in the project. However, to reduce the administrative task of processing a&#13;
series of contracts and to take advantage of economies of scale, technical assistance and&#13;
training events would be packaged whenever possible.&#13;
5.    The funds for institutional development at the project level will be administered by&#13;
PRORURAL. PRORURAL will contract all technical assistance and training for the PAC&#13;
program and in cases of packaging or upon request by the Municipal Councils within the&#13;
FUMAC program. FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils may contract technical&#13;
assistance and training for themselves or, upon request, for beneficiary associations, with&#13;
the assistance of PRORLURAL and on the basis of standard terms of reference.&#13;
PRORURAL would monitor the use of institutional development funds by the Municipal&#13;
Councils and likewise by beneficiary associations through review of statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs) and periodic supervision.&#13;
6.    Percentage of subproject cost targeted to technical assistance. At the&#13;
discretion of community associations, subproject proposals may include an allocation of&#13;
the total amount to be directed to the contracting of technical assistance for preparation&#13;
and/or implementation of the subproject. The percentage would vary from 2% to 8% of&#13;
the subproject cost, and would be subject to criteria such as the complexity of the&#13;
subproject, whether a standard subproject exists, and other factors, with the final&#13;
determination made by the Municipal Councils (FUMAC and FUMAC-P) and&#13;
PRORURAL (PAC).&#13;
7.    For technical assistance and training financed as a percentage of the subproject&#13;
cost, each proposed program would need to be described in detail in the subproject&#13;
proposal. For technical assistance during subproject preparation, the service provider&#13;
would necessarily work in an "at-risk" situation, since the reimbursement for services&#13;
provided would only be provided if the subproject is indeed approved and funded under&#13;
the project. However, to avoid the risk of hampering the provision --under this mode-- of&#13;
technical assistance for subproject preparation, community associations can request&#13;
Municipal Councils to use resources from the institutional development component instead&#13;
to contract the required assistance. For technical assistance provided as a percentage of&#13;
subproject cost after subproject approval, the funds allocated to technical assistance would&#13;
be disbursed to the beneficiary association directly. The beneficiary association would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -                            Annex E&#13;
contract the extensionist/entity under procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
described in the Operational Manual. For "turn-key"-type contracts, where the technical&#13;
assistance provider helps prepare and then implement the subproject, a smaller percentage&#13;
would be paid for the preparation assistance vis-a-vis the implementation assistance, in&#13;
order to direct the financial incentive toward the successful irnplementation of the&#13;
subproject.&#13;
8.    For greater effectiveness, technical assistance to subprojects should extend into the&#13;
post-implementation (i.e., operation and maintenance) period, particularly for productive&#13;
subprojects where success depends on the association's capacity to operate and administer&#13;
the small enterprise. Therefore, as a prerequisite for approval of productive subprojects,&#13;
community associations would have to provide a satisfactory technical assistance plan with&#13;
the service provider identified. In addition, as part of their commitment to sufficiently&#13;
operate and maintain their subprojects, the community associations should include&#13;
technical assistance among the expenditures to be financed out of the O&amp;M funds&#13;
maintained by each association. PRORURAL and the Municipal Councils would actively&#13;
encourage this practice during routine monitoring and supervision.&#13;
SERVICE PROVIDERS&#13;
9.    The identification and mobilization of technical assistance and training providers is&#13;
a crucial complement to the availability of resources. The most important lproviders of&#13;
technical assistance would continue to be PRORURAL and the project Municipal&#13;
Councils. Other service providers are readily identifiable frorri their participation in the&#13;
reformulated NRDP:&#13;
(a)   Multilateral and bilateral technical assistance agencies--international&#13;
technical assistance organizations contracted by PRORIURAL can provide&#13;
technical assistance to PRORURAL and the M[unicipal Councils at the&#13;
project level;&#13;
(b)   EMATER extensionists--in each municipality, local accredited agents&#13;
would be identified by PRORURAL to be contracted by individual&#13;
community associations for work on a particular subproject, or by&#13;
Municipal Councils, on a retainer contract, for clearly-specified work with&#13;
several communities. As a rule, the project would channel resources (only&#13;
for incremental operating costs; not salaries) directly to the local level and&#13;
not to the central, state-level agency, thereby stimulating greater local&#13;
participation, rewarding effective agents and penalizing those that do not&#13;
effectively provide the assistance needed; and,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -                           Annex E&#13;
(c)   NGOs--staff from local grassroots organizations can serve as accredited&#13;
agents, as described in the paragraph above, or the NGOs themselves can&#13;
enter into contracts with associations, the Municipal Councils or&#13;
PRORURAL for global or specific technical assistance and training&#13;
activities.&#13;
10.   PRORLTRAL and Municipal Councils would be charged with developing lists and&#13;
contacting other potential sources of technical assistance, such as: university students,&#13;
local private organizations, private extensionists, and state agencies. These lists would be&#13;
updated annually and would be available at the local level.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
11.   To create institutional incentives in PRORURAL to promote accountability for&#13;
technical assistance and training activities, technical assistance would need to be a more&#13;
visible and effective line function within PRORURAL. PRORURAL would therefore&#13;
nominate from among its staff a high-level Technical Assistance Coordinator. The&#13;
Coordinator would be responsible for overseeing the Institutional Development&#13;
component and the technical assistance arrangements stemming from the percentage&#13;
method, described above. The main tasks of the Coordinator would be to: (a) develop&#13;
the technical assistance and training framework under the project; (b) identify and contact&#13;
potential technical assistance providers and maintain updated lists for each municipality&#13;
and for the project as a whole; (c) identify and prepare potential local accredited agents;&#13;
(d) prepare the annual technical assistance and training proposal for the project; (e) assist&#13;
the Municipal Councils in the preparation of the annual technical assistance and training&#13;
proposals and review the proposals presented by each Municipal Council; (f) develop&#13;
model terms of reference for specific technical assistance activities and training events; (g)&#13;
encourage replication of successful technical assistance and training activities wherever&#13;
possible; and, (h) based on supervision findings, measure and report on the progress of&#13;
technical assistance arrangements and their effectiveness.&#13;
12.   As part of their regular supervision efforts, PRORURAL and the Municipal&#13;
Councils would monitor the frequency and quality of technical assistance and training&#13;
provided to each subproject. SOEs presented by Municipal Councils and community&#13;
associations for technical assistance and training expenditures would be closely monitored&#13;
by PRORllRAL to ensure that resources are used exclusively for that purpose and in a&#13;
cost-effective manner. As further incentive for their effective use, loan funds allocated to&#13;
the Institutional Development component will not be permitted to be re-allocated to&#13;
finance community subprojects or any other expenditure under the project. To give&#13;
Municipal Councils greater incentive to promote and achieve successful technical&#13;
assistance arrangements in their respective municipalities, the provision of technical&#13;
assistance, both by the Councils and other providers, would be considered a parameter by&#13;

which to judge the overall performance of project Municipal Councils and would factor&#13;
into decision-making on the promotion of FUMAC Councils to FUMAC-P. Technical&#13;
assistance would also be monitored through the project's monitoring and reporting&#13;
arrangements (see Annex H). Information from the MIS would identify active technical&#13;
assistance contracts which will then be followed up during subproject supervision visits.&#13;
The mid-year and annual project progress reports, compiled by PRORURAL for the Bank,&#13;
would contain specific sections pertaining to the quantity, quality and effectiveness of&#13;
technical assistance provided. The project implementation review (Annex H) would also&#13;
evaluate the quality and cost-effectiveness of technical assistEmce and thus provide the&#13;
beneficiaries' assessment of technical assistance arrangements. The Bank's Recife Office&#13;
would evaluate the project's technical assistance arrangements during regular supervision&#13;
visits.&#13;

PERNAMBUCO&#13;
F. THE FUMAC-P PILOT PROGRAM&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Decentralization of decision-making and the transfer of project implementation&#13;
responsibilities from the State to the local (municipal and community) levels, started under&#13;
the reformulated NRDP with the introduction of the community-based PAC and FUMAC&#13;
programs, will be further advanced in the proposed project. First, FUMAC coverage will&#13;
expand significantly under the project. Second, a further step towards decentralization&#13;
will be taken through a pilot program, FUMAC-P, which will promote the transfer of&#13;
financial management responsibilities to several FUMAC Municipal Councils.&#13;
2.    Generally, municipalities which have participated in FUMAC to date tend to be&#13;
those in which the environment for participatory decision-making is more favorable, which&#13;
distinguishes them from more traditionally-run municipalities with a strong "cientelistic"&#13;
approach. This environment has been the result of a conjunction of cultural/political&#13;
factors, such as the emergence of a movement for the development of civil society (usually&#13;
induced by religious organizations, NGOs and more recently by some political parties) and&#13;
of a new generation of more open-minded political leaders.&#13;
3.    Several important lessons have emerged from the FUMAC experience under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP. First, it has proved to be an efficient, transparent approach for&#13;
identifying and prioritizing, through local-level consensus building, multiple demands for&#13;
investments by needy communities. Second, it has provided the opportunity to experiment&#13;
not only with increased transfer of decision-making, including approval of subprojects,&#13;
from the State-level Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) to Municipal Councils representing&#13;
communities, but also with the management of community subproject funds by these very&#13;
Councils. This experience is reflected in the proposed project in the design of FUMAC&#13;
and, in particular, FUMAC-P, where the feasibility of financial management at the&#13;
grassroots level will be tested.&#13;
FUMAC-P: MAIN FEATURES&#13;
4.    The FUMAC-P pilot would account, initially, for about US$4.0 million -- or 8% of&#13;
the total base cost of the project -- over the four-year implementation period. As it is&#13;
considered that, in order to motivate project Municipal Councils (both FUMAC and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -                          Annex F&#13;
FUMAC-P) and have them participate in the project in a sustainable manner, each Council&#13;
--and its communities-- should benefit from a minimum of 5 subprojects per year, the&#13;
initial amount allocated to this subcomponent would allow the installation of some 10&#13;
FUMAC-P Councils by the end of the project period. However, if this pilot approach&#13;
proves successful with the communities and meets its objectives of local-level investment&#13;
selection, execution and financial management, FUMAC-P would be expanded with funds&#13;
initially earmarked for the FUMAC and PAC subcomponents (see para. 10) and more&#13;
FUMAC-P Councils than initially foreseen could be set up during project implementation.&#13;
5.    Initially, the PCU would select FUMAC-P municipalities from among the best&#13;
FUMAC performers under the ongoing NRDP, i.e., those with the best record in&#13;
administering and executing community subprojects. Additionally, other municipalities&#13;
which have a favorable environment for participatory work (extensive community&#13;
organization, municipal officials open to participative decision-making, etc.), and are&#13;
interested and can commit themselves to following project guidelines, could be included.&#13;
There should also be some indication that local capacity exists to manage financial&#13;
resources, for instance in communities or existing associations already managing small-&#13;
scale businesses (on an individual or group basis) and whose members could potentially&#13;
form part of FUMAC-P Municipal Councils. As the proposed project gets underway, and&#13;
the FUMAC-P approach proves successful, other well-perfornming FUMAC municipalities&#13;
could gradually be upgraded into FUMAC-P municipalities.&#13;
6.    Once the municipalities are selected, allocation of funds would be done based on a&#13;
number of criteria to which different weights will be assigned. These criteria may include&#13;
several of the following:&#13;
(a)   ratio of rural to total population;&#13;
(b)   rate of indigence;&#13;
(c)   number and degree of dispersion of poor rural communities;&#13;
(d)   availability of public resources per capita;&#13;
(e)   number of subprojects approved under the reformulated NRDP (small&#13;
discriminatory factor);&#13;
(f)   performance in the previous year; and&#13;
(g)   willingness of the mayor (prefeito) to participate.&#13;
7.    FUMAC-P Municipal Councils would have the same composition and modes of&#13;
operation as FUMAC Municipal Councils (Annex D). They would be responsible for:&#13;
(a)   assisting rural communities in identifying priority needs and translating&#13;
them into investment proposals;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                          Annex F&#13;
(b)   screening and reviewing these proposals, and ensuring that they meet&#13;
eligibility criteria as contained in the Project Operational Manual;&#13;
(c)   monitoring and supervising, together with the PCU, the implementation of&#13;
approved subprojects;&#13;
(d)   providing, directly or through contracting, technical assistance and training&#13;
to beneficiary associations in the design and operation and maintenance of&#13;
project-financed investments;&#13;
(e)   managing subproject funds and transferring funds to beneficiary&#13;
associations with approved subprojects; and&#13;
(f)   preparing indicative annual operating plans (POAs) for review and&#13;
approval by the PCU. The POA would contain a list of community&#13;
investment priorities, indicative targets to be met, a tentative timetable, the&#13;
indicative budget and the technical assistance required to implement the&#13;
proposed program. The PCU would review and approve the POA at the&#13;
end of the year preceding implementation.&#13;
8.    An agreement (convenio) between the PCU and the Municipal Council would&#13;
establish the terms and conditions as well as rights and obligations of each party with&#13;
respect to the release and use of the approved funds. These (both loan and state&#13;
counterpart funds) would be deposited into an account in a commercial bank, and would&#13;
be withdrawn solely upon formal order by the Municipal Council. The Council would&#13;
screen community subproject proposals on the basis of the approved POA and the funds&#13;
made available by the PCU. An agreement (convenio) between the Municipal Council and&#13;
the beneficiary association would be required.&#13;
9.    Regular supervision of the operations of the FUMAC-P Municipal Councils would&#13;
be the responsibility of the PCU, focusing in particular on the administrative and financial&#13;
arrangements made by the Councils to effectively control and release project funds to the&#13;
community associations and on progress in the implementation of the POA agreed for&#13;
each FUMAC-P Council. Municipal Councils would be aided in their tasks, both for&#13;
management and accounting as well as subproject appraisal, monitoring and supervision,&#13;
by appropriate technical assistance under the guidance of the PCU. Unsatisfactory&#13;
performance of a Council would have to be carefully assessed by the latter, including the&#13;
weighing of penalties, if necessary. If unsatisfactory performance is not rapidly corrected,&#13;
it may lead to a reduction of the budget envelope allocated to it the next year (para. 6) or,&#13;
in the case of serious wrongdoing such as misappropriation or misuse of funds, to legal&#13;
remedies, combined with restructuring of the Council or even its expulsion from FUMAC-&#13;
P back to FUMAC. On the other hand, built-in incentives would encourage positive&#13;
performance. Positive performance, for example, would be rewarded with a potential&#13;
expansion in the budget envelope allocated each year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 89 -                          Annex F&#13;
10.   In addition, the project implementation review to be carried out at mid-term would&#13;
include a specific evaluation of the FUMAC-P program. The basic purpose of this&#13;
evaluation will be to assess performance under the pilot program and, if necessary, to&#13;
adjust its design and mechanisms in order to improve its procedures and ilmpact on&#13;
beneficiaries. If the pilot program is found successful and its expansion is justified, part of&#13;
the PAC and FUMAC funds under the project could be transferred to the FIUMAC-P&#13;
program.&#13;

G. STANDARD DESIGNS AND OPERATION AND&#13;
MAINTENANCE OF SUBPROJECTS&#13;
STANDARD DESIGNS&#13;
1.    Experience under the NRDP has shown that the technical elaboration of&#13;
subprojects can be a difficult task for rural community associations. In some cases,&#13;
especially where competent technical assistance is not available locally, this has resulted in&#13;
inappropriate design, cost overruns and subprojects left incomplete or unoperational.&#13;
Under the proposed project, preparation of subprojects by associations, as well as&#13;
appraisal of the technical proposals by Municipal Councils and/or the Project Coordinating&#13;
Unit (PCU), will be facilitated with the adoption of standard designs developed by the&#13;
PCU for the most common types of subprojects found in Pernambuco. The use of&#13;
standard designs will ensure that, at least for those subprojects most in demand by&#13;
communities, project investments follow recommended technical specifications, both for&#13;
construction and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), meet reasonable cost parameters so&#13;
as to be financially viable, and comply with all necessary environmental requirements. At&#13;
the same time, the risk of "directing" community demand towards subprojects for which&#13;
standard designs will be made available would be reduced by the project's information&#13;
campaign which advises communities, inter alia, about the variety of subprojects that are&#13;
eligible for financing.&#13;
2.    Different standard designs (projetospadrao) or appropriate standard&#13;
documentation will be prepared for the various types of investments: productive,&#13;
infrastructure and social subprojects. The main items to be included in each of the&#13;
relevant documentation are indicated below.&#13;
3.    For productive subprojects:&#13;
(a)   a summary of the existing situation, including considerations on demand,&#13;
supply of raw materials, as well as markets;&#13;
(b)   a set of considerations and parameters to carry out simplified feasibility&#13;
studies, in particular: a presentation of subproject objectives and potential&#13;
benefits; the technical production process and type of equipment required;&#13;
technical parameters such as expected yields, coefficient of utilization,&#13;
range of output; range of costs of production, depreciation, maintenance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -                            Annex G&#13;
etc.; expected benefits and number of beneficiaries; indicative internal rates&#13;
of return, benefit/cost ratios, and other such indicators;&#13;
(c)   technical aspects, including a description of civil works, technical&#13;
specifications, bill of quantities, and the list of suppliers of equipment&#13;
required to operate the subproject;&#13;
(d)    guidelines for O&amp;M; and&#13;
(e)    environmental considerations and recommendations for specific measures&#13;
to mitigate the negative impact, if any, of the proposed subproject.&#13;
In addition, a set of operating rules (regulamento de uso) will accompany the&#13;
documentation for each of the proposed productive subprojects.&#13;
4.    For social subprojects:&#13;
(a)    a methodology for establishing the profile of social demand in order to&#13;
properly tailor the size of the required facility;&#13;
(b)    design considerations, e.g., services to be delivered by the proposed&#13;
subproject, and technical, legal and administrative aspects;&#13;
(c)   technical aspects as for productive subprojects;&#13;
(d)    O&amp;M features, including an evaluation of the delivery cost:s of the&#13;
proposed social service; and&#13;
(e)    environmental considerations where relevant.&#13;
5.    For infrastructure subprojects, whose size can vary widely depending on the local&#13;
context, intended number of beneficiaries and other factors, the concept of standard design&#13;
as such is not totally adequate. However, it is possible to develop:&#13;
(a)    generic terms of reference for engineering of different types of subprojects,&#13;
e.g., water supply systems, road rehabilitation, etc.; and&#13;
(b)    "typical" engineering (projetos tipicos) of small works such as pipes and&#13;
box culverts, retaining walls and typical decks for small bridges.&#13;
6.    Standard designs will be available for those types of subprojects that most respond&#13;
to the needs and demand of communities. By project effectiveness, a first group of&#13;
standard designs will have been prepared by the PCU, and listed in the project Operational&#13;
Manual, for the following types of subprojects: manioc mills, agricultural machinery&#13;
(communal tractors, etc.), small-scale irrigation, sheep/goat raising, animal traction farm&#13;
machinery, health-related house improvement, water supply systems, communal washing&#13;
facilities, earth-made fords and electrification. A second group of standard subproject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92 -                            Annex G&#13;
designs for other types of subprojects that are requested by at least 10 different&#13;
communities, will be elaborated by the end of the first year of project implementation.&#13;
7.    Careful field supervision and monitoring of standard subprojects by the PCU will&#13;
be necessary in order to: (i) avoid mistakes to be replicated on a large scale, and (ii) fine-&#13;
tune and adjust the standard designs that have been developed. The need for the different&#13;
participating states to share experience on standard designs of subprojects has also been&#13;
identified. In particular, those that have been prepared by the first three states (Bahia,&#13;
Ceara and Sergipe) could be shared by Pernambuco and others. Workshops should be&#13;
arranged in which standard subproject documentation developed by the different states&#13;
would be used for discussions to compare and evaluate the different solutions that have&#13;
been found to the same problem.&#13;
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
8.    Although the reformulated NRDP has financed many of the same types of&#13;
community investments (e.g., manioc mills or small-scale rural water supply projects) that&#13;
have been supported under past programs or projects in the Northeast, one of its&#13;
innovative features has been to ensure that these investments are operated and maintained&#13;
by the beneficiaries themselves, thereby enhancing their sense of ownership and the&#13;
prospects for sustainability of the investments. Under the proposed project, this feature&#13;
will be maintained and strengthened.&#13;
9.    Community associations will bear the primary responsibility for O&amp;M for most&#13;
project-funded investments, and this provision will be included in the agreements&#13;
(convenios) with the associations. The relative responsibilities of the associations for&#13;
O&amp;M would vary according to the type of investment. As a general rule, beneficiaries&#13;
would be fully responsible for operating and maintaining their own productive subprojects&#13;
and some social subprojects, such as day care centers or home improvements for health&#13;
purposes (e.g., for control of Chagas disease). In the case of schools or health posts&#13;
rehabilitated under the project, and most infrastructure subprojects, the responsibility for&#13;
O&amp;M would normally be shared between the communities and the relevant State or&#13;
municipal institution. In exceptional cases of relatively complex subprojects, beneficiary&#13;
associations might contract private firms or NGOs to assist them in O&amp;M tasks.&#13;
10.   Based on experience under the reformulated NRDP, several types of arrangements&#13;
would be implemented in order to ensure the financial sustainability of project investments,&#13;
as follows:&#13;
11.   Productive Subprojects (e.g., manioc and rice mills, clothes making, small-scale&#13;
irrigation schemes, and farm machinery). Once a subproject has been approved for&#13;
financing, the beneficiary association elects a committee to be in charge of subproject&#13;
implementation and management. This commnittee has the task, among others, of&#13;
determining the different dues and user fees to be charged to association members (as well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-93 -                            Annex G&#13;
as to non-association members using project facilities), based on estimated requirements&#13;
for O&amp;M and capital replacement or eventual expansion. User fees have to be approved&#13;
by all association members, and may be paid in cash, labor or kind, depending on the&#13;
particular situation. The committee is responsible for collecting the fees, placing them in a&#13;
"reserve fund", managing the reserve fund to meet extraordinary maintenance and capital&#13;
replacement requirements, and making payments for recurrent expenditures such as&#13;
electricity consumption, fuel, inputs, repairs, and employees' salaries.&#13;
12.   Social Subprojects (e.g., day care centers, housing improvement, school or health&#13;
post rehabilitation). The degree of community involvement in the O&amp;M of social&#13;
subprojects depends on the type of investment. In the cas,e of subprojects related to public&#13;
services, such as health posts or schools, the municipality or relevant public/private entity&#13;
could undertake O&amp;M following an agreement with the community. For other types of&#13;
subprojects such as day care centers or house improvement, the community will be&#13;
responsible for O&amp;M, each of the community members contributing either financially or in&#13;
the form of labor.&#13;
13.   Infrastructure Subprojects (e.g., small bridges, water supply systems, fords,&#13;
road repairs). Different arrangements are to be followed for O&amp;M of infrastructure&#13;
subprojects. In the case of services (e.g., water supply) connected to individual&#13;
households, beneficiaries could transfer the corresponding assets to the relevant state or&#13;
municipal utility company, which then undertakes O&amp;M and recovers costs through user&#13;
fees. Simplified water supply systems (without connection to households) will be&#13;
operated and maintained by the community itself, which makes arrangements for collection&#13;
of dues or fees from individual community members to pay for O&amp;M expenses. These&#13;
arrangements are commonly found in the rural water supply subprojects financed under&#13;
the reformulated NRDP. For infrastructure subprojects such as roads, bridges, and street&#13;
paving, which serve a larger public, responsibility for O&amp;M would normally be shared&#13;
with the municipality under agreement with the beneficiary association.&#13;

H. PROJECT MONITORING, REPORTING AND&#13;
EVALUATION&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
1.    The establishment of an efficient project monitoring system will be instrumental in&#13;
following the progression of the investment program financed by the proposed&#13;
Pernambuco Rural Poverty Alleviation Project and ascertaining its consistency with&#13;
project objectives. Project implementation relies heavily on a decentralized system of&#13;
decision-making and management, and is driven by demand from rural community&#13;
associations which is filtered through a selection process based on established criteria.&#13;
This process involves a large number of small, diverse subprojects over an extensive&#13;
geographic area. Hence, since the ex ante determination of the pattern of project&#13;
investment and other key parameters is not possible, effective supervision depends on the&#13;
existence of a capable monitoring system.&#13;
2.    The objectives of the project monitoring system are to:&#13;
(a)   provide information regarding the progress of the project and the status of&#13;
the subproject cycle in its different stages (e.g., subproject approval,&#13;
procurement, implementation and disbursement); and&#13;
(b)   verify that project activities are consistent with the guidelines, targeting&#13;
methodology and selection criteria included in the Project Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;
Project Database&#13;
3.    The project monitoring system would depend on a Management Information&#13;
System (MIS), created under the reformulated NRDP' and to be improved under the&#13;
Under the reformulated NRDP, this system was referred to as the SSMP, or Simplified Project&#13;
Monitoring System.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -                   Annex H&#13;
project. The project MIS is a data base organized in three general levels: (a) a subproject&#13;
information module, which contains pertinent physical and financial information for each&#13;
subproject; (b) a financial management module, from which Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOEs) are generated; and (c) a project management module, from which all project&#13;
reports are generated. Under the proposed project, the MIS will operate as a network to&#13;
facilitate the inputting of information and provide access to up-to-the-minute information&#13;
by all levels of project management, tailored to individual needs.&#13;
4.    For the State of Pernambuco, PRORURAL (the Project Coordinating Unit or&#13;
PCU) and would be responsible for operating and maintaining the MIS and for providing&#13;
the input corresponding to PAC subprojects. The project Municipal Councils would be&#13;
responsible for completing the data sheets for FUMAC and FUMAC-P subprojects and,&#13;
upon completion of each data sheet, would present them to PRORURAL which would&#13;
subsequently update the MIS.&#13;
5.    The subproject module is the basic module into which all information collected&#13;
from the subprojects is entered and processed. Subproject information feeds into both the&#13;
financial management module and the project management module. Subprojects are&#13;
identified and entered in the MIS according to the followinrg format. Information for the&#13;
MIS is inputted from data sheets for each subproject, separated into four submodules&#13;
w.hich correspond to key steps of the subproject cycle:&#13;
(a)   Submodule No. 1 would include information for the subproject regarding&#13;
its location and identification, according to the following format: (a) by&#13;
program [PAC, FUMAC, and FUMAC-P]; (b) by type [Infrastructure,&#13;
Productive and Social subprojects]; (c) by category [e.g., water supply,&#13;
agro-processing, energy, etc.]; (d) by sub-category, in particular for water&#13;
supply subprojects [e.g., dams, wells, tanks. etc.]; and, (e) by location&#13;
[municipality, community and beneficiary association];&#13;
(b)   Submodule No. 2 would include the technical, social and financial&#13;
characteristics, as well as a set of indicators such as cost/capita, cost/m2,&#13;
and other parameters to the subproject budget;&#13;
(c)   Submodule No. 3 would include information on subproject implementation,&#13;
including procurement procedures and contracting, all disbursement data,&#13;
including beneficiary and municipal government contributions to&#13;
counterpart funding, and provision of technical assistance and training to&#13;
the community association in question; and&#13;
(d)   Submodule No. 4 would include subproject completion information,&#13;
including beneficiary numbers and relevant subproject impacts (e.g.,&#13;
production figures, income generated, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-96 -                     Annex H&#13;
6.    The information input into the MIS would come from standard data sheets of three&#13;
types: (i) subproject data sheet; (ii) supervision data sheet; and (iii) graduation data sheet.&#13;
The subproject data sheet, completed by PRORURAL (for PAC) and the Municipal&#13;
Councils (for FUMAC and FUMAC-P) would supply the basic information on the&#13;
subproject stemming from the subproject proposal. The supervision data sheet would&#13;
verify and/or update information on the subproject data sheet, identify any implementation&#13;
problems and possible mitigating measures, and report relevant subproject impacts. The&#13;
supervision data sheets would be completed by PRORURAL and Municipal Councils, or&#13;
by those entities subcontracted to provide supervision services, in which case the&#13;
supervision data sheets would be included in the TORs. Finally, the graduation data&#13;
sheets would include information on the community itself, including existing infrastructure&#13;
and other indicators of community well-being (see Annex C), to be filled out by the&#13;
beneficiary community associations as part of their subproject proposals, and verified&#13;
and/or updated by PRORURAL, Municipal Councils, or subcontracted participating&#13;
agencies.&#13;
7.    Given the 1,660 subprojects estimated to be financed during the four years of&#13;
project implementation, the MIS is an essential tool for following the course of project&#13;
investment. Information from the MIS is also fundamental to measure compliance with,&#13;
and subsequent effectiveness of, the project's targeting mechanisms. By monitoring the&#13;
direction of project benefits and types of subprojects being financed, PRORURAL and the&#13;
Municipal Councils can direct appropriate technical assistance and training based on the&#13;
frequency of certain types of investment or target community mobilization activities. Cases&#13;
of mistargeting or misappropriation of funds -- resources channeled outside the project&#13;
area or for ineligible investments -- will be verified using the MIS in order for appropriate&#13;
remedies to be applied.&#13;
Monitoring Activities&#13;
8.    Within the framework of the project monitoring system, PRORURAL and the&#13;
project Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-P) are responsible for&#13;
supervising the application of the guidelines from the Operational Manual in the&#13;
development and implementation of all subprojects. Using the information from the MIS,&#13;
combined with field visits and inputs from project supervision reports, project-contracted&#13;
studies and audits, PRORURAL and the Municipal Councils would monitor project&#13;
characteristics and trends, identify implementation problems and accomplishments and&#13;
undertake or promote appropriate actions to improve project implementation (see Annex J&#13;
on Project Supervision). The MIS will also serve as a basis from which to derive Annual&#13;
Operating Plans (POAs), regulate their implementation, and make necessary adjustments&#13;
to the POAs and corresponding budgets during the course of each fiscal year. The&#13;
delineation of monitoring responsibilities between PRORURAL and the Municipal&#13;
Councils would be clearly reflected in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -                   Annex H&#13;
PROJECT REPORTING&#13;
9.    PRORUTRAL is responsible for reporting on project progress to the Bank. Four&#13;
types of reports would be generated by PRORURAL and presented to the Bank:&#13;
(a)   a copy of the content of the MIS data base on diskette would be provided&#13;
on a monthly basis to the Bank's Field Office in Recife. The information&#13;
from the MIS will facilitate Bank supervisiorn efforts and monitoring of the&#13;
investment program;&#13;
(b)   an MIS-generated report which would includle the updated status of project&#13;
implementation (USPI) and an updated list of subprojects with their&#13;
physical, procurement and disbursement status would be provided to the&#13;
Bank's Field Office in Recife at the same time that the statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs) are sent to Bank Headquarters. The USPI and&#13;
subproject list will permit the Recife Office to review the eligibility of&#13;
subprojects presented for reimbursement;&#13;
(c)   a Mid-year Project Progress Report, using standard formats agreed with&#13;
the Bank, would be presented by July 31 of each year of project&#13;
implementation; and,&#13;
(d)   an Annual Report, would be presented by January 31 of each year of&#13;
project implementation. The Annual Report would use the standard&#13;
formats from the mid-year report but would also include a comprehensive&#13;
review of (i) the status of the project performance indicators and the&#13;
specific activities of the institutional development component; (ii)&#13;
subproject appraisal indicators, the status of the targeting of project&#13;
benefits, the application of subproject investment eligibility criteria, and&#13;
other implementation guidelines included in the Operation Manual; and (iii)&#13;
other relevant analyses and recommendations from project-contracted&#13;
studies and audits which may be applied to improve project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -                   Annex H&#13;
PROJECT EVALUATION STUDIES&#13;
10.   The project would develop and implement a range of evaluation studies to measure&#13;
the impact of the subproject investments and to provide appropriate feedback to improve&#13;
project methodology and implementation. PRORURAL would be responsible for drafting&#13;
Terms of Reference (TORs), which would form part of the Project Operational Manual,&#13;
and contracting local and other consulting services, both steps in agreement with the&#13;
Bank, for the following studies: (a) annual physical performance reviews; (b) a mid-term&#13;
implementation review; and (c) a comprehensive impact evaluation. These studies are&#13;
described below. In addition, the project would finance a study to determine the point of&#13;
community graduation and details on this study are included in Annex C. During the&#13;
course of project implementation, PRORURAL may also identify other needed evaluation&#13;
studies which can be financed under the project in agreement with the Bank.&#13;
Annual Physical Performance Reviews&#13;
11.   The objective of the Physical Performance Review (PPR) is to evaluate the success&#13;
of investments financed by the project, in terms of their achievement of specific subproject&#13;
objectives, and the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of the investments. For each&#13;
subproject included in the sample, the study would focus on the following points: (a) the&#13;
adequacy of the physical design in relation to the subproject's objective; (b) the quality and&#13;
cost of subproject execution; (c) the efficiency of procurement procedures used; and (e)&#13;
the targeting of project benefits. The PPR would provide indication of the effectiveness of&#13;
community-based procurement; compliance with and/or needed adjustments to cost&#13;
indicators and other physical/financial appraisal indicators and to the Standard Designs&#13;
included in the Operational Manual; and the quality of project investments and the profile&#13;
of distribution of project benefits. The PPR will also be an important input to the project's&#13;
implementation review and to project Annual Reports.&#13;
12.   The PPR will be conducted on the basis of TORs agreed with the Bank and&#13;
included in the Operational Manual. The first PPR will be conducted at the end of 1997&#13;
for a sample of subprojects representative of the prior year's investment program (PAC,&#13;
FUMAC, and FUMAC-P). To conduct the PPR, PRORURAL would: (i) establish, with&#13;
Bank agreement, the sample of subprojects to be reviewed; (ii) supply counterparts to the&#13;
independent consultants contracted by PRORURAL to implement the study; (iii)&#13;
participate in the diagnosis and generation of appropriate recommendations; and (iv)&#13;
incorporate the recommendations into the implementation of the project. Subsequent&#13;
PPRs would be conducted each year and would review physical performance issues&#13;
identified during the first PPR and monitor improvements. TORs for the remaining PPRs&#13;
would be agreed with the Bank by no later than July 31 of each corresponding year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -                   Annex H&#13;
13.   In addition, the first PPR will include a module to measure the quality and&#13;
efficiency of community procurement (direct contracting) of goods and works. Similar to&#13;
an audit, this module of the PPR would analyze the contracting procedures used and the&#13;
accompanying documentation for a sample of subprojects. The issues to be examined&#13;
would include: (a) the transparency of the contracting process; (b) if the goods/works&#13;
were procured at the lowest cost for the quality required and how these costs compare&#13;
with the unit cost references in the MIS; (c) in the case of technical assistance, if the&#13;
service providers contracted satisfied the profile and experience indicated in the TORs;&#13;
and (d) if the documentation maintained by the community association is sufficient to&#13;
complete Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) and to satisfy an audit.&#13;
Implementation Review&#13;
14.   Project performance would be measured through an in implementation review at&#13;
the mid-term of project implementation. The purpose of the implementation review is to&#13;
assist the State Government of Pernambuco, PRORURAL and the Bank, in the&#13;
identification of positive experiences and implementation problems and bottlenecks,&#13;
particularly in FUMAC and FUMAC-P, in order to recomniend needed modifications to&#13;
their methodology and design. Importantly, since the FUMAC-P program is a pilot, this&#13;
mid-term review would determine its feasibility and recommend its expansion.&#13;
15.   The mid-term review would be carried out through beneficiary consultations--&#13;
interviews and group discussions. These consultations would determine, inter alia: (i)&#13;
how the project is perceived and valued by the actual beneficiaries; (ii) level of community&#13;
participation -- and any outside involvement (e.g. NGOs, EMATER, etc.) -- in the&#13;
different stages of the subproject cycle, including in the process of prioritizing local&#13;
demands; (iii) effectiveness of the subprojects in alleviating poverty and its consequences;&#13;
(iv) the access to and quality of technical assistance for the preparation, implementation&#13;
and O&amp;M of subprojects; (iv) the role of the Municipal Cotncils, how these Councils are&#13;
perceived in the communities, and how decisions on prioritization are effectively made;&#13;
(vi) the role of Mayors in decision-making and in actual project implementation; (vii) the&#13;
operation and maintenance of subprojects; and (v) how the role and performance of&#13;
PRORURAL is viewed in the communities (for PAC). Additional questions would&#13;
evaluate the efficiency and impact of the different subcomponents (PAC, FUMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P), the effectiveness of institutional development activities, the level of&#13;
community participation, and the ability of the project to target and reach the poor.&#13;
Overall, the beneficiary consultations would generate a reliable evaluation of project&#13;
performance and impact as seen through the eyes of the ultimate beneficiaries which&#13;
would serve, as a convincing input to improve project implementation.&#13;
16.   The implementation review would be carried out at the end of the second year of&#13;
project implementation with a sample of community associations drawn from FUMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P municipalities, with a small residual sample dravm from PAC municipalities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -                   Annex H&#13;
and a sample of Municipal Councils. The implementation review would be carried out by&#13;
independent consultants -- preferably a local organization with field experience -- under&#13;
TORs and contracting procedures agreed with the Bank. Inputs to the review process&#13;
would include: the mid-year and annual reports, MIS-generated analyses and reports,&#13;
results of the PPRs, recommendations from project audit reports, and additional reviews&#13;
or studies contracted by PRORURAL.&#13;
Project Impact Evaluation&#13;
17.   The project would also finance a baseline (year 1) and final (year 4) evaluation to&#13;
measure the socio-economic impact of the subproject investments. This comprehensive&#13;
evaluation, based on a random sample survey of representative subproject types, would&#13;
select important socio-economic indicators, such as employment, income, health,&#13;
education, and migration, and measure the impact of subproject investments on these&#13;
indicators and consequently the impact of the project on the quality of life of the&#13;
beneficiary population, differentiating by gender where possible. The evaluation would&#13;
also relate impact back to specific aspects of the project in order to identify those&#13;
conditions or activities which have resulted in positive impacts.&#13;
18.   The evaluation study would also measure the effects of the project on the financial&#13;
situation at the municipal and state levels, due to the positive impacts on project&#13;
beneficiaries (communities and families). For example, the financing of subprojects for&#13;
community water supply implies savings for municipal governments, and even State and&#13;
Federal Governments, in drought periods by preempting the need of these governments to&#13;
finance temporary water provision to rural communities through carro pipa, typically a&#13;
signficant expenditure for municipal governments of the Northeast and one which is not&#13;
made to the extent needed due to limited resources. The project would also generate&#13;
benefits in terms of improved health or, in general terms, in improved quality of life for&#13;
beneficiaries, which would result in savings for the State or municipal governments in&#13;
medical services, medicines, etc., furnished to rural communities. In addition, the project&#13;
produces products over which the State and municipal governments can collect taxes&#13;
(such as the ICMS tax on marketed production). These products can include not only&#13;
products generated by productive subprojects but also consumer goods (e.g. refrigerators,&#13;
radios, etc.) purchased by families benefitting from rural electrification subprojects.&#13;
Therefore, the study would evaluate the aggregate impact of the project at the State and&#13;
municipal levels, measuring: (a) the savings permitted by the project, in terms of&#13;
expenditures for water supplied by carro pipa and provision of medical services, etc., that&#13;
no longer have to be made due to the project, and (b) the taxes generated by various types&#13;
of subprojects financed.&#13;
19.   As in the mid-term implementation review, the study would concentrate on&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P municipalities, where the majority of project investments would&#13;
be located, and include a small sample of PAC municipalities, consistent with the project's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -                   Annex H&#13;
investment profile. The indicators would be identified and measured during the baseline&#13;
evaluation in the first year of project implementation, and assessed in the final evaluation&#13;
at the conclusion of implementation. The impact evaluation would be carried out by&#13;
independent consultants and contracted under TORs and procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
Implementation Plan and Project Performance Indicators&#13;
20.   The implementation plan and project performance indicators for each project&#13;
component over the four-year implementation period were agreed upon during appraisal.&#13;
Given the demand-driven nature and flexibility of the project, these indicators will be&#13;
mostly indicative targets. They can be expected to be achieved at least in the initial year of&#13;
the project, but may well develop somewhat differently in subsequent years, particularly in&#13;
terms of the proportion that each main category of subprojects (infrastructure, social or&#13;
productive) would represent out of the total investments financed by the project.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT -&#13;

J. PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
1.    The principal role of project supervision is to ensure that project implementation&#13;
follows the guidelines set forth in the Loan Agreement and detailed in the Operational&#13;
Manual. At the operational level, project supervision arrangements are designed to&#13;
provide essential information on the general performance of the project and the feedback&#13;
necessary for managerial decision-making. Information collected regularly from the field&#13;
during project implementation will provide PRORURAL (the Project Coordinating Unit&#13;
or PCU) with the tools necessary to: (a) identify and correct departures from project&#13;
guidelines; (b) reinforce targeting mechanisms; (c) modify technical assistance strategies;&#13;
and (d) identify training needs.&#13;
2.    Supervision Responsibilities. In line with the decentralized implementation of&#13;
the project, the responsibilities for project supervision at the state and local levels will&#13;
correspond to PRORURAL and the project Municipal Councils, respectively:&#13;
(a)   at the state level: PRORURAL will monito:r global trends across all project&#13;
municipalities, oversee the functioning and activities of project Municipal&#13;
Councils, and supervise the portfolio of subprojects under the PAC&#13;
subprogram; and&#13;
(b)   at the local level: the project Municipal Councils will monitor the&#13;
performance of the subproject portfolio under the FUMAC and FUMAC-P&#13;
subprograms.&#13;
3.    At the state level, PRORURAL's responsibilities include: (i) monitor the quality&#13;
of global project implementation and administration; (ii) assess community participation in&#13;
the identification, preparation and execution of PAC subprojects, as well as the quality of&#13;
technical assistance provided to beneficiary communities in, PAC; (iii) collect and verify&#13;
pertinent information on the project and subprojects for the MIS; and (iv) review the&#13;
activities of the FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils.&#13;
4.    Supervision of the proiect Municipal Councils by PRORURAL will focus on the&#13;
following points: (i) the composition of the Councils to ensure they meet the required&#13;
80% beneficiary representation; (ii) the frequency and openmess of the Councils' meetings;&#13;
(iii) the criteria applied to screen, prioritize and approve subproject proposals and the&#13;
effectiveness of targeting of project benefits to the poorest communities; and (iv) the&#13;
capacity of the Councils to provide technical assistance to the beneficiary communities.&#13;
In addition to these points, supervision of the FUMAC-P Councils will focus on whether&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-112 -                           Annex J&#13;
the administrative and financial arrangements made by these Councils are effective in&#13;
managing and releasing subproject funds to the community associations as well as&#13;
progress in the implementation of POAs agreed for each FUMAC-P Council.&#13;
5.    At the local level, the Municipal Councils, with support from PRORURAL, will&#13;
carry out the following supervision tasks in their respective municipalities: (i) verification&#13;
of the status and quality of subproject implementation; (ii) assessment of community&#13;
participation in the identification, preparation and execution of subprojects; (iii) evaluation&#13;
of the extent to which communities are organized to effectively undertake the operation&#13;
and maintenance of the investments, following, in the case of productive subprojects, the&#13;
appropriate regulamentos de uso; (iv) identification of technical assistance and training&#13;
needs; and (v) assessment of effectiveness of targeting of project benefits and&#13;
identification of potential beneficiary communities not yet participating in the project. In&#13;
addition to these tasks, FUMAC-P Councils will follow-up on compliance by beneficiary&#13;
associations with subproject agreements signed with them.&#13;
6.    To fulfill their supervision responsibilities, given the number of subprojects in the&#13;
field and the amount of information to collect, both PRORURAL and the project&#13;
Municipal Councils may delegate some supervision tasks to selected NGOs and&#13;
participating public agencies (e.g., EMATER), according to specific terms of reference&#13;
developed for this purpose. This assistance would be especially useful for evaluating the&#13;
status of community organization and mobilization. In addition, to facilitate the&#13;
supervision of individual subprojects under implementation, PRORURAL and the&#13;
Municipal Councils would liaise with the Subproject Supervision and Control Committees&#13;
(Annex D) --community members designated to supervise each subproject and control the&#13;
status and quality of subproject implementation. Whether carried out by PRORURAL,&#13;
Municipal Councils or a partner organization, subprojects would receive two supervision&#13;
visits in their first year of implementation and, in the case of productive subprojects and&#13;
water supply subprojects, at least one visit per year thereafter.&#13;
7.    Supervision Reporting. Information collected during supervision, including&#13;
indicators of subproject implementation performance and the identification of the principal&#13;
bottlenecks or problems, will be incorporated into the subproject standard data sheets (see&#13;
Annex H) and included in the MIS, maintained by PRORURAL. To aid the overall&#13;
information collection process between the state and local levels, the project Municipal&#13;
Councils will report regularly to PRORURAL on the implementation of the subprojects in&#13;
their respective municipalities. The contents and frequency of these reports would be&#13;
determined by PRORURAL and included in the Operational Manual. Based on the&#13;
project and subproject information collected at the state and local levels, PRORURAL will&#13;
prepare and submit to the Bank mid-year and annual reports on the overall physical and&#13;
financial status of project implementation and performance. In addition, PRORURAL will&#13;
present the Annual Operating Plan (POA) and corresponding budget for each subsequent&#13;
fiscal year of implementation to the Bank for its review and comment.&#13;

8.    World Bank Supervision. In keeping with the decentralized implementation of&#13;
the project, and based on the experience under the reformulated NRDP, the Bank will&#13;
continue its decentralized supervision of the project. The Bank will carry out at least two&#13;
regular supervision missions per year from its field office in Recife. Regular supervision&#13;
will entail: (i) a discussion of project implementation problems identified by PRORURAL&#13;
and/or Municipal Councils; (ii) field visits to a random sample of community subprojects;&#13;
and (iii) a review of the performance of all project components, and particularly an&#13;
assessment of the FUMAC-P pilot subprogram, to address problems and make appropriate&#13;
recommendations. In addition, based on frequent communication with PRORURAL, the&#13;
Recife Office will conduct short supervision missions to address problems which require&#13;
prompt action. Also, in view of the diversity of community subprojects, consultants of&#13;
different expertise would be contracted to provide occasional input and advice to Bank&#13;
missions. Two full supervision reports will be issued annua:lly, as well as Back-to-Office&#13;
reports for each short supervision mission. It is estimated that about 28 staff-weeks will&#13;
be required for project supervision, or about 7 staff-weeks annually during the four years&#13;
of project implementation.&#13;
9.    The schedule of project supervision is as follows:&#13;
(a)   by July 31 and January 31 of each year, presentation of mid-year and&#13;
annual reports from PRORURAL to the BarLk;&#13;
(b)   by February and September of each year, full Bank supervision missions&#13;
completed; and&#13;
(c)   by October 30 of each year, presentation of the POA for the subsequent&#13;
year to the Bank for review and comment by November 15.&#13;

            Brazil - Northeast Rural Poverty
            Alleviation Program : Rural Poverty Alleviation Project - Pernambuco
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation
            Project will assist the state Government of Pernambuco to
            alleviate rural poverty and its consequences by: a)
            providing basic social and economic infrastructure and
            employment and income generating opportunities for the rural
            poor; b) decentralizing resource allocation and decision
            making to local levels; c) providing a safety net for the
            rural poor during a period of macroeconomic reform and
            fiscal adjustment; and d) leveraging resources mobilized at
            community and municipal levels. The project will include
            three main components: a) community subprojects, to support
            small-scale investments selected, operated and maintained by
            the beneficiaries; b) institutional development, to provide
            entities and communities with technical assistance and
            training to increase capacity and improve project
            implementation; and c) project administration, supervision,
            monitoring and evaluation, to finance project coordination
            and activities to provide project performance and impact feedback.
