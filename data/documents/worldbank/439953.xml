        <abstracts>
            Nontraditional infrastructure service
            providers supply many low-income consumers in slums and
            urban peripheries in developing countries. And technological
            change has eased entry by new providers. But the current
            approach to private participation in infrastructure
            typically gives exclusivity to a local monopoly for a long
            period. In return, the monopoly utility is obligated to
            provide service to all in the area at a certain standard,
            charging a rising block tariff and using some
            cross-subsidies. This approach can inadvertently erect
            barriers to improving service for low-income households.
            Policymakers therefore need to rethink their approach to
            private participation transactions and their regulation. In
            particular, they need to focus on facilitating new entry.
