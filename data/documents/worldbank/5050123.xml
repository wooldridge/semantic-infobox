SECTIONA. COUNTRYAND SECTORBACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
&#13;
1.      The North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment Project (NGEST) is the fourth in a series&#13;
o f water and sanitation-focused projects supported by the Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank&#13;
(TFGWB) and administered bythe International Development Association (IDA, also referredto&#13;
inthis document as the World Bank or the Bank) since the beginningof the peace process in&#13;
October 1993.           It follows up on the Emergency Water Project (EWP; US12.5 million,&#13;
TF052627, approved in Fiscal Year (FY) 04), which seeks to address urgent water supply&#13;
problems in the southern area o f the West Bank.                     It also complements the proposed Gaza&#13;
Emergency Water Project (currently under preparation), which will seek to improve water and&#13;
wastewater services delivery in Gaza through a management contract with a private operator.&#13;
The latter project also aims to consolidate the efforts begun under an earlier TFGWB-supported&#13;
project' to rehabilitate the networks and systems in Gaza, and to lay the foundation for the&#13;
establishment o f the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) and strengthening sector&#13;
regulation.&#13;
&#13;
The Crisis'&#13;
&#13;
2.       Since the beginning o f the second PalestinianIntifada in September 2000, the West Bank&#13;
and Gaza (WB&amp;G) has been ina very deep social, economic and political crisis. This crisis has&#13;
been the result o f a protracted and violent conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians. The&#13;
violence emanating from both sides has taken the lives o f some 3,100 Palestinians and 980&#13;
Israelis. Duringthis period, Palestinianeconomic and social indicators have fallen dramatically:&#13;
&#13;
m   Real gross national disposable income per capita declined by 21 percent between 1999, and&#13;
    2003, while overall losses have reached some US$5.2 billion - equal to almost one year o f&#13;
    pre-Intifada Palestiniannational i n ~ o m e . ~&#13;
&#13;
.   Physical damage is estimated at more than US$1.7 billion at replacement cost, and capital&#13;
    stock has declined by about 20 percent.&#13;
    Total investment has fallen from about US$1.45 billion in 1999, to US$500-550 million in&#13;
    2002.&#13;

&#13;
                                                            -1-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
.    The share o f the population living inpoverty - defined as those consuming less than US$2.1&#13;
..   o f goods and services per day4 - has more than doubled, reaching nearly 50 percent o f the&#13;
     population (and two-thirds inGaza).&#13;
     The health status o f the Palestinian populationhas declined.&#13;
     Real per capita food consumption has dropped by up to a quarter when compared to 1998&#13;
     levels.&#13;
3.       Closures, Le.,       restrictions on the movement o f people and goods, have led to&#13;
unemployment and a consequent loss o f demand. Unemployment has increased from 10percent&#13;
in September 2000, to over 39 percent o f the Palestinian workforce today (39 percent inGaza).&#13;
InSeptember 2000, some 128,000 Palestinians commuted daily to Israel andIsraeli settlements;&#13;
bythe second quarter o f2004, this figure had fallen to 48,000.&#13;
&#13;
4.       The Palestinian Authority's (PA) finances have also been under severe pressure. Tax&#13;
revenues are directly linkedto the level o f economic activity, with more than 80 percent derived&#13;
from taxes on consumption (value-added tax (VAT), import duties and excise)                                -   almost two&#13;
thirds o fwhich are collectedby Israel on the PA's behalf and were withheld by the Government&#13;
o f Israel (GOI) betweenDecember 2000, and December 2002. The fiscal situation eased slightly&#13;
following GOI's decision in December 2002, to resume transfers o f clearance revenue, but it&#13;
remains precarious due to the recent decline in donor emergency budget support.                                     Donor&#13;
budgetary support has averaged US$39 million per month in 2002; however, in 2003 donors&#13;
have disbursed less than a half o f this amount each month (about US$18 million). The first five&#13;
months o f 2004 have seen support increase to an average o f US$28 million, still well below the&#13;
monthly average recorded in2002.&#13;
&#13;
PA Response&#13;
&#13;
5.       Inresponse to the crisis, the PA has undertaken a number o freforms and developed two&#13;
programs.       The latest is the Socio-Economic Stabilization Plan (SESP), which forms the&#13;
backdrop to this project. The SESP is based on three economic scenarios for 2004-2005:&#13;
Scenario "A": political stagnation; Scenario "B":political progress; and, Scenario "C":&#13;
political deterioration. The need for budget support and humanitarian assistance will remain&#13;
considerable under all three scenarios, with fiscal recovery a more distant prospect and poverty&#13;
persisting at highlevels.&#13;
&#13;
6.       SESP Budget and Program: The specific objectives o f the SESP, to be pursued within&#13;
..&#13;
the context o f the three scenarios outlined above, are to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
.     contribute to the basic humanitarian and social needs o f a growing Palestinian population;&#13;
      helpmeet theparticular requirements o fthe underserved populationinthe WB&amp;G;&#13;
      helpalleviate the damage causedto the public andprivate sectors as a result o fthe conflict;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4 The US$2.1 poverty line is based on what is considered to be the minimumacceptable level o f expenditures (food and non-&#13;
  food) per capita ina benchmark household consisting o f two adults and four children (National Commission for Poverty&#13;
  Alleviation, PalestinePoverty Report 1998).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             -2-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
m    improve the efficiency and strengthen the delivery o f services supplied by the PA and local&#13;
     governments, through capacity-buildingandreform;&#13;
     provide financial support for the operation o f local government units; and&#13;
=    lay the foundation for a private sector ledrecovery.&#13;
&#13;
7.       Of an overall proposed program o f US$1,198.5 million, the largest share (US$650&#13;
million or about 50 percent) i s dedicated to budget support. The second highest allocation&#13;
(US$278 million or 23 percent) i s to public infrastructure development, followed by US$164&#13;
million (14 percent) for humanitarian and social as~istance.~The un-funded portions o f the&#13;
budget (i.e., the new requests) are about US$896 million. Ofthis amount about US$116 million&#13;
is accounted for by Public Infrastructure, making about 40 percent o f the budget for Public&#13;
Infrastructure un-funded. Water, electricity and transport account for about 55 percent (US$153&#13;
million) o f the total Public Infrastructure budget under SESP. Some US$60 million o f this&#13;
amount is proposed for investment in the water and wastewater sector, including this proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
8.       The Bank's engagement in WB&amp;G6has been characterized by a constant need to adapt.&#13;
The Bank's involvement can be discerned in three phases. During the first phase, from 1994-&#13;
1996, the Bank placed an emphasis on establishing the Palestinian Authority (for which the&#13;
Technical Assistance and Holst Trust Funds were instrumental), and the rehabilitation o f basic&#13;
physical infrastructure (roads, schools, health clinics, water andwastewater networks) inorder to&#13;
provide immediate and tangible benefits to the population. In the second phase, from 1997-&#13;
2000, as the PA's fiscal situation stabilized and the closures o f 1995-1996 were lifted, the Bank's&#13;
program featured an increased focus on institution building, private sector development, and&#13;
regulatory and institutional reform. The Bank's assistance during the Intifada, from late 2000 to&#13;
the present, constitutes the third phase o f Bank intervention and features a balance between&#13;
maintaining a focus on medium-term development activities, where feasible, and providing&#13;
emergency assistance designed to sustain Palestinianinstitutions and mitigate poverty.&#13;
&#13;
9.       In response to economic hardship and fiscal crisis, the Bank has placed increasing&#13;
emphasis on fast-disbursing operations, with US$109.1 million committed to various emergency&#13;
projects since the beginning o f the Intifada.7 Initially, consistent with the Bank's emergency&#13;
support duringperiods o f closure inthe 1990s, priority was given to job creation (the Emergency&#13;
Response Program, FYO1); however, the scale o f job losses rendered such efforts marginal in&#13;
their overall impact.           From 2001 onwards, the Bank's emergency strategy shifted towards&#13;
&#13;
  Financialrequirements for humanitarian assistance are derived from disbursed assistancein2002 amounts (US$215 million for&#13;
  cash and food assistance, job creation programs and the support to emergency appeals o f the UnitedNations Relief and Works&#13;
  Agency for Palestinian Refugees-UNRWA),           adjusted for the change inthe number of poor under the three scenarios.&#13;

  These are              Response Program, which financed over 200 labor-intensive micro-projects; two Emergency Services&#13;
  Support Projects (plus a supplemental grant), which provide operating cost support to the main social service ministries&#13;
  (Education, Health, and Social Affairs); the Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project, which helps municipalities&#13;
  sustain basic services (solid waste, electricity, water &amp; sanitation) as well as strengthen budget and planningprocesses;&#13;
  Emergency Water Project, which alleviates severe water shortage inthe southem West Bank; and, the Structural Adjustment&#13;

sustaining basic services, largely through support towards operating costs.                              An additional&#13;
element in the Bank's emergency response was the reallocation o f US$10.3 million from six&#13;
Credits to finance public infrastructure repairs, approved by the Board in August 2002.' In the&#13;
coming two years, the objective o f the Bank's strategy and program i s to balance efforts to&#13;
manage the emergency with a continued focus on a medium-term development agenda. This&#13;
objective builds on the bi-focal strategy espoused in the Bank's two Economic Assessments,'&#13;
now reflected inthe SESP.&#13;
&#13;
The Water andWastewater Sector&#13;
&#13;
10.      The first significant attempt at the development o fthe water andwastewater sector began&#13;
with the establishment of the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) in 1995."                                    Since then,&#13;
considerable progress has been made:&#13;
&#13;
     A capable nationalinstitution(PWA) hasbeenbuilt.&#13;
      Several existing municipal distribution networks have been rehabilitated, new networks&#13;
      developed, and supplies improved.&#13;
      Several new wells have been drilled and many rehabilitated - particularly in the West&#13;
      Bank.&#13;
      A primarybackbone network o fbulk-water carriers is under construction inthe West Bank&#13;
      andreadyto be launched inGaza.&#13;
      In Gaza, the municipal networks and systems have been significantly upgraded under an&#13;
      intemationally recruited management contractor, and effective managerial and operational&#13;
      systems have beenestablished.&#13;
      A newwater law hasbeenpassed.&#13;
      Several studies have been undertaken to evaluate resource availability and quality, supply&#13;
      and demand, well and network conditions, tariffs, technical and financial management, and&#13;
      institutional options.&#13;
      A coherent nationalpolicyhasbeenlaidout anda nationalplan developed.&#13;
      Plans for the establishment o fthe C M W U inGaza are at an advanced stage.&#13;
      The foundations for policy and operational coordination with Israel have been established&#13;
      through the Joint Water Committee (JWC).&#13;
&#13;
11.      Issues: Despite these considerable efforts and many noteworthy achievements in the&#13;
fundamental structure and performance o f the water supply and delivery system, much remains&#13;
to be done:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
* The six projects being the Municipal Infrastructure Development Projects I&amp; 11, the Education Action Project, the Bethlehem&#13;
  2000 Project, the Gaza Industrial Estate Project andthe Solid Waste and Environmental Management Project.&#13;

  Seven Months: Intifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis-An Economic Assessment (May 2003).&#13;
loThe PWA was established by Decree 90/1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              -4-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     Average water production and consumption remain at 105 and 65 liters per capita per day,&#13;
     respectively, well below Israel and regional comparators; critical water resources are still&#13;
     almost totally under Israeli control.&#13;
     Supply in Gaza i s o f highly variable quality; the Gaza aquifer remains degraded and at risk&#13;
     o firreversible damage.&#13;
     Adequate wastewater treatment and disposal are still lacking, and the potential for&#13;
     wastewater reuse is not effectively exploited.&#13;
     Adequate transmission netivorks and systems have yet to be developed.&#13;
     While the new law and the proposed institutional reforms are positive developments, they&#13;
     need to be reviewed and, inany case, some measures have yet to be fully implemented.&#13;
     While the institutional framework has improved, it still needs further rationalization.&#13;
     Distribution institutions and systems are still inefficient and in need o f major reform and&#13;
     rehabilitation, and water losses are unacceptably high.&#13;
     Tariffs (particularly inGaza) generally do not reflect the cost o f operations or maintenance,&#13;
     muchless development needs.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Insum, despite the fact that water supply and demand inthe West Bank, andto a lesser&#13;
degree in Gaza, remains highly constrained by Israeli actions, there has been considerable&#13;
progress inthe sector, an achievement o f which PWA can bejustly proud. Nevertheless, there is&#13;
still a long and difficult road ahead - one made even more difficult by the on-going crisis. So far&#13;
PWA has shown that it is equal to the challenge, and that much can be accomplished with&#13;
steadfast leadership and effective donor support.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Impact of Current Crisis on Sector: An estimated US$900 million in overall&#13;
infrastructure sector damage was inflicted on WB&amp;G between September 2000 and July 2003.&#13;
The water andwastewater sector accounted for about US$140 million, or about 15 percent o f the&#13;
total. Most o f the damage involved the breakage of supply lines and the destruction o f water and&#13;
sewage pumps and installations.       Moreover, because o f the deteriorated security conditions,&#13;
some projects were either suspended or are being implemented at a very slow pace. In some&#13;
cases donors withdrew their commitments. Consequently, the sector suffers from serious lags&#13;
with respect to implementing the Palestinianwater sector strategy.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Donor Support 1996-2003: Donors have beenvery active inthis sector to date. The total&#13;
support provided to projects between 1996 and 2003 was estimated at US$730 million, o f which&#13;
about US$500 million to the West Bank and US$230 million to Gaza. This i s equivalent to an&#13;
annual average donor investment in the sector o f about US$90 million -US$60 million in the&#13;
West Bank and US$30 million in Gaza. Since 1996, projects valued at some US$300 million&#13;
have been completed in the West Bank and some US$l50 million are in progress.                  The&#13;
remaining US$50 million have been pledged, but have yet to be committed to specific projects.&#13;
The highest investment, around US$160 million, was in the Hebron governorate, followed by&#13;
Ramallah andNablus governorates (US$60 million andU S 5 0 million, respectively). The share&#13;
going to the remaining West Bank governorates was significantly limitedby Israeli constrains on&#13;
the geographic distribution of projects. For the same period, the value o f the projects completed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
in Gaza was estimated at US$60 million, while projects valued at about US$170 million were&#13;
ongoing.&#13;
&#13;
The Wastewater Sub-Sector&#13;
&#13;
15.       The WB&amp;G environmental strategy calls for the collection and treatment o f all&#13;
wastewater from the urban centers; however, this sub-sector remains neglected. The relatively&#13;
large volume o f wastewater collected in Gaza (64 percent) is not properly treated and i s&#13;
significantly contributing to the contamination o f the coastal aquifer and seashores including&#13;
bathing beaches. Only 9 percent o f the wastewater is collected inthe West Bank, and most o f it&#13;
is not properly treated. The risk o f contamination o f the deeper West Bank aquifers has caused&#13;
concern to all parties, including Israel. In response, PWA has recently formed a "wastewater&#13;
committee" to begin to deal with the issue.&#13;
&#13;
16.       There are three wastewater treatment facilities in Gaza, all o f which are designed as&#13;
aerated lagoons. The facility in the south, serving part o f Rafah City is essentially a collection&#13;
pond with very minor treatment facility, and the poorly treated wastewater is disposed into the&#13;
sea. The second plant serves Gaza City, and i s about 50 percent overloaded. The effluent is&#13;
mostly disposed to the sea (about 50,000 cubic meters (CM) per day), but its quality is still&#13;
acceptable. The third plant i s inthe north (at Beit Lahia)'' and is heavily overloaded (over 100&#13;
percent), poorly functioning and not equipped with any disposal facilities. Israel prohibits the&#13;
bulko fthe poorly treated effluent from the plant, approximately 4.5-5 millionC Mper year, from&#13;
being discharged into the sea, and so it is typically dumped in sand dunes neighboring the plant,&#13;
greatly contributing to the high nitrate levels in the underlying shallow aquifer.                 PWA has&#13;
prepared a sewage master plan for Gaza, but its implementationhas so far been delayedby a lack&#13;
o f firm donor commitment andthe deteriorating security situation.&#13;
&#13;
17.       The wastewater situation in the West Bank i s not quite as alarming, but it is serious&#13;
nonetheless. Roughly 91 percent o fthe populationrelies on septic tanks for temporary storage o f&#13;
wastewater, none o f which is treated. The majority o f these septic tanks are emptied through&#13;
private-sector vacuum trucks, which empty the septic tanks and discharge the wastewater into the&#13;
closest wadi. Of the 9 percent that is collected by sewers and sent to one o f the seven treatment&#13;
plants, only that o f a1Bireh Municipality i s functioning properly. The result i s that roughly 25&#13;
million C M o f untreated wastewater per year are discharged into the environment at over 350&#13;
1ocations.l2&#13;
&#13;
 18.      The pressure on the environment from wastewater i s fiu-ther intensified by the large&#13;
amount o fwastewater created bythe Israeli settlements inside the West Bank.I3 This wastewater&#13;
i s usually disposed in the same wadis although in some cases it may be pumped to Israel for&#13;

treatment. Exact figures are difficult to obtain, but it is estimated that 25 to 40 million C M o f&#13;
wastewater are produced each year.14&#13;
&#13;
19.     Wastewater Reuse.l5 Wastewater re-use i s slowly gaining acceptance throughout&#13;
WB&amp;G. Various studies show that the willingness to reuse wastewater for agricultural purposes&#13;
inboththe WB&amp;G ishigher thanonce expected, and shouldnotpresent anobstacle to wider use.&#13;
Pilot studies carried put in the West Bank (a1 Bireh, Hebron) have thus far proven successful in&#13;
terms o f treated water quality and suitability for specific crops. The benefits accruing from&#13;
treatment and reuse (including preserved water resources and decreased public-health spending)&#13;
are estimated to be quite positive. InGaza, about 10,000 C M o f treated effluent from the Gaza&#13;
City Wastewater Treatment Plant are infiltratedinto the aquifer via infiltration basins daily.&#13;
&#13;
Bank Response and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
20.     The Bank's current strategy i s documented in "The Trust Fund for Gaza and the West&#13;
Bank: Status, Strategy, and Request for Replenishment," Report No: 27094-62, November 5,&#13;
2003, and has been summarized inparagraphs 8 and9 above. The strategy aims at continuing to&#13;
lay the institutional foundation for statehood through knowledge-based analytical and policy&#13;
work, and operations that encourage the development o f sound governance institutions at the&#13;
central and sector levels; and, in the context o f the current crisis, to provide analytical and&#13;
programmatic leadership to the collective donor effort to cope with the emergency, while&#13;
initiating multi-donor operations to support the delivery o f essential services and the&#13;
maintenanceh-ecovery o fprivate sector activity.&#13;
&#13;
21.     The proposed project is not specifically mentioned in the strategy as the situation&#13;
concerning the Beit Lahia wastewater treatment plant (BLWTP) has significantly deteriorated&#13;
(duringthe 2003 rainy season) only after the document was presented to the Board. However, it&#13;
addresses specific, highpriority emergency issues inthe wastewater sub-sector and supports the&#13;
Bank's already widely respected leadership in the collective donor effort to find effective ways&#13;
to assist with the most negative social and economic consequences o f the crisis in WB&amp;G. In&#13;
addition, the technical assistance given to PWA will help support more effective system&#13;
management and sustain the foundation for deeper institutional reforms.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
22.      The Bank has had considerable global experience in designing and implementing&#13;
operations in response to natural disasters and emergencies arising in conflict-affected settings.&#13;
Also, developing countries are becoming increasingly aware o f the need to put inplace measures&#13;
to prevent or reduce risks arising from crises. Thus, the number o f Bank-supported emergency&#13;
recovery projects has increased in the past ten years, and the Bank has come a long way in its&#13;
own understanding o fhow to operationalize sustainable interventions inemergency situations.&#13;
&#13;
23.      InWB&amp;G specifically, the Bank is often relied uponby the PA and donors to lead such&#13;
efforts, andhas done so successfully. For example:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
    The Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project (EMSW; TF-50956; US$20&#13;
    million; FY03), prepared in close coordination with the European Commission (EC) and the&#13;
    Government o f Belgium, among others, i s leveraging over US$37 million in parallel&#13;
    financing. Additional donor co-financing i s expected to follow once the proposed Municipal&#13;
    Fundis established.16&#13;
    The Emergency Water Project (EWP; TF-52627; US$12.5 million; FY04), prepared inclose&#13;
    coordination with PWA, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and&#13;
    the French Development Agency (AFD), aims to relieve the severe water shortage in the&#13;
    villages o f the southern West Bank. The EWP i s expected to leverage some US$70 million&#13;
    equivalent indonor funding for the area.&#13;
    The Bank's comparative advantage and global experience have been instrumental in&#13;
    implementing innovative institutional reforms in the sector pioneered under the Water and&#13;
    Sanitation Services Project (WSSP; TF-26056; US$31 million; FY97) andthe Southern Area&#13;
    and Sanitation ImprovementProject (SAWSIP; TF-22443; US$21 million; FYOO);17&#13;
&#13;
    The Bank's Country Office has a comparative advantage by virtue o f its highly skilled and&#13;
    experienced national and international staff, who can effectively administer and supervise&#13;
    emergency programs inthe WB&amp;G.&#13;
    Through its various water and wastewater studies and projects in WB&amp;G over the last 8&#13;
    years, the Bank has gained a deep knowledge and understanding o f the sector and&#13;
     demonstrated considerable practical and intellectual leadership. It has also built a strong&#13;
    relationship with PWA and other key donors inthe sector.&#13;
    As a result, and after several failed attempts by others, the Bank has been specifically asked&#13;
    bythe PWA andbydonors to take the leadinthis very urgent and sensitive project.&#13;
&#13;
SECTION B. THEPROJECT&#13;
&#13;
Project Background&#13;
&#13;
TheBeit Lahia Wastewater TreatmentPlant (BLWTP)in Gaza&#13;
&#13;
24.       The BLWTP was built in 1976 and designed to serve a population o f 50,000 with a load&#13;
capacity to treat 5,000 C M per day o f wastewater to secondary treatment levels. The original&#13;
design didnot incorporate any effective effluent disposal and the treated effluent had been left to&#13;
infiltrate into the sand dunes surrounding the plant. Inthe past, this did not pose any risks, since&#13;
the effluent quality was good and the sandy soil was able to handle the volume o f effluent&#13;
through natural infiltration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l6EMRSP is amunicipalinstrument, anddoes not address deeper supplyand distribution problemsinthe water sector-at least,&#13;
  not inthe short run.&#13;
l7The key institutional reformcomponent o f SAWSIP was restructuredrecentlyinresponsethe termination of the contract with&#13;
  the international operator on grounds offorce majeure. Both actions were directly due to the current crisis.        Given the&#13;
  circumstances, it is highly unlikely that the strategic objectives for the creation of the southem water utility can become a&#13;
  reality inthe short-term. During this period of instability, the focus will be placed in addressingthe pressingneedsto supply&#13;
  additionalwater while pursuingthe modest objective of establishingjoint service councils, which would be a stepping-stone&#13;
  for the creationof the future southemutility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                -8-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25.     Over the years, communities were provided with sewerage networks, which were&#13;
subsequently connected to the BLWTP. Consequently, as o f May 2004, the volume o f sewage&#13;
inflows at the BLWTP was estimated at over 12,000 C M per day, substantially exceeding the&#13;
plant's capacity, and the plant was serving a population o f 190,000 from the municipalities o f&#13;
Jabalya (including the refugee camp), Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and UmA1Nasser.&#13;
&#13;
Safetv Hazard -Flooding and Future Increase in Effluent Flow&#13;
&#13;
26.     The combination of the increasing volume o f sewage inflows and insufficient capacity to&#13;
properly handle it has ledto poorly treated effluent overflowing from the treatment plant into the&#13;
surrounding sand dunes, creating a growing lake o f nearly 1.5 million C M o f foul water, which&#13;
now covers over 30 hectares (300 dunums). The water level in this poorly treated effluent lake&#13;
continues to rise and i s threatening to hydraulically overflow the whole sewerage collection&#13;
system and flood the neighboring communities.&#13;
&#13;
27.     Without a concerted and rapid response to the persistent rise in the level o f the effluent,&#13;
such flooding is regarded as inevitable. It has already occurred on two occasions, in 1989 and&#13;
1992, when sand barriers collapsed under the pressure o f the foul water. The flooding caused&#13;
several fatalities, health problems and resulted in substantial damage to residential buildings in&#13;
Beit Lahia. According to PWA, tens o f thousands o f people will be affected ifthe lake were to&#13;
overflow into these communities again.           PWA and other local agencies have intervened to&#13;
strengthen and raise the height o f the sand barriers around the lake and try to prevent such&#13;
flooding from happening again, but these are only band-aid solutions to a serious threat to the&#13;
residents o f that area.&#13;
&#13;
Health Hazards&#13;
&#13;
28.     Inadditionto the physicalthreat offlooding, the effluent lakeprovides anaturalbreeding&#13;
ground for mosquitoes and parasites and i s a source o f groundwater contamination and foul&#13;
gases. This is conducive to the transmission o f water-bome diseases. A large and growing&#13;
number o f children are already showing signs o f digestive and respiratory health problems, with&#13;
infants under the age of six months beingthe most vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
29.     An assessment o f the risks threatening the communities near the treatment site was&#13;
conducted inJune 200318by the Gaza health authorities. The assessment concluded that while a&#13;
population o f about 55,000 living in the Beit Lahia area i s exposed to serious health hazard,&#13;
people living in the village o f Um A1Nasser, at the edge o f the effluent lake, are at the highest&#13;
level o frisk. The UmA1Nasser village clinic identified three principal healthproblems:&#13;
&#13;
    (i)     Over 50 percent of children haveproblems with their digestive system.&#13;
&#13;
    (ii)    The population i s also suffering from skin infections and allergies caused by the high&#13;
            prevalence o fmosquitoes leading to ulcers, itching and rashes.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
   (iii)    Respiratory diseases, caused by gases from the sewage basins and the high levels o f&#13;
            humidityinthe summer, are also widespread.&#13;
&#13;
30.     Health professionals are seriously concerned about the long-term effects o f this&#13;
hazardous environment on the local population. Intheir view, these unhealthy conditions could&#13;
lead to the increased incidence o f stunted growth, mental disorders and cancer. The continuous&#13;
fear o f flooding into the local communities may also cause additional stress and psychological&#13;
damage.&#13;
&#13;
OnRoingand ulanned investments&#13;
&#13;
31.     In2000, PWA obtained agreement for concessionary financing to fund a new wastewater&#13;
treatment plant to serve the needs o f the North Governorate in Gaza. The proposed plant was&#13;
designed to adequately handlesewage volumes for the whole northem region, as projected by the&#13;
Sewage Master Plan (1998) for Gaza. The treated effluent would then be recharged into the&#13;
aquifer through better-designed infiltration basins and/or reused for appropriate irrigation. The&#13;
design work for the new treatment facility and main carriers was substantially completed when&#13;
the deteriorated security situation in Gaza made it difficult to pursue implementation, and&#13;
activities under that project were suspended inNovember 2003.&#13;
&#13;
32.     In anticipation of building the new wastewater treatment plant mentioned above, PWA&#13;
has been active insecuring financing for investments aimed at implementing the master plan and&#13;
extending the sewerage coverage for municipalities in north Gaza.         Ongoing and planned&#13;
investments inthe sewerage network are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0   Jabalva: Ineast Jabalya, coverage is estimated to be about 100percent, including the refugee&#13;
    camp. In the southwest portion o f the municipality, investments funded by the Swedish&#13;
    International Development Agency (SIDA) are being carried out, and by the end o f 2004, an&#13;
    additional 15,000 people will be connected to the network. In the northwest portion o f&#13;
    Jabalya, funding is being sought to finance the investments necessary to connect an&#13;
    additional 15,000 people to the network. These investments will bring the overall coverage&#13;
    inJabalyato about 95 percent.&#13;
&#13;
    In Beit Lahia, only 55 percent of the population is connected to the sewerage network.&#13;
    Ongoing works being financed by the United Nation's Development Programme and by&#13;
    Germany's Kreditanstalt fur WiederauJbau (KfW) will raise sewerage coverage to 75&#13;
    percent, connecting an additional 10,000 people to the network.&#13;
&#13;
0   InBeitHanoun, only 65 percent ofthe population has accessto sewerage services. Two new&#13;
    residential areas have been built and about 15,000 people will be connected to the sewerage&#13;
    network bythe end o f 2004. The local residents are financing the investment.&#13;
&#13;
0   InUmA1Nasser, 5,000 people are expected to be connected by 2006 with financing from&#13;
    KfW.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               -10-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33.     Based on the above, the sewage inflow in North Gaza is expected to increase to 19,000&#13;
C M per day by 2006, and by 2012 the inflows are expected to reach 34,000 C M per day.lg&#13;
Given this expected increase in sewage inflows it i s crucial that the new wastewater treatment&#13;
plant with the appropriate capacity materializes.           Otherwise, an even bigger disaster may be&#13;
looming.&#13;
&#13;
Emergencv measures&#13;
&#13;
34.     Recognizing the immediate and serious threat to the environment andpublic health, PWA&#13;
initiated temporary emergency measures in January 2004, to prevent catastrophic overflowing o f&#13;
the effluent from the lake into the surrounding communities, especially before the next rainy&#13;
season. With support from SIDA and TFGWB the following measures are currently under&#13;
implementation:&#13;
&#13;
     Continuous reinforcement o f the embankment around the lake to reduce the risk o f a sudden&#13;
     failure (cost o f this component was fully covered by PWA).&#13;
&#13;
     Constructiono f three holding ponds (total capacity o f about 90,000 CM) adjacent to the lake&#13;
     designed to drain o f f excess effluent from the lake (cost o f these three ponds was fully&#13;
     coveredbythe PWA).&#13;
&#13;
     Upgrading o f two nearby existing storm water basins to be used as additional temporary&#13;
     effluent infiltration basins (financed by SIDA).&#13;
&#13;
     Construction o f one additional emergency effluent infiltration basin with an area o f 13,000&#13;
     square meters to the north o fthe existing seven lagoons including a pressure main to connect&#13;
     all new basins to a new pumpingstation at the southern edge o f the lake. Implementation o f&#13;
     this activity is close to completion, andit is financed by SIDA (US$625,000).&#13;
&#13;
     Construction o f a pumping station to pump the effluent from the lake into the new&#13;
     infiltration basin and the existing storm water basins. This will help to temporarily reduce&#13;
     the flooding threat and the negative environmental impact o f the effluent lake. The cost o f&#13;
     this component (US$125,000) is fully funded by TFGWB, from the Gaza Interim&#13;
     Emergency Framework under SAWSIP.&#13;
&#13;
     Selection by PWA o f local contractors who are on standby with heavy equipment to repair&#13;
     the lake embankments, should an emergency situation call for their rapid intervention.&#13;
     Offers from local contractors have been received, reviewed and the selection process is&#13;
     complete.&#13;
&#13;
35.      Although the above emergency components are not considered part o f a permanent&#13;
solution, they will improve the immediate total ground infiltration capacity o f the whole site to a&#13;
level o f 8,000 C M per day, which i s still below the daily sewage inflow o f 12,000 CMper day to&#13;
the BLWTP. This will result in a temporary slowdown o f the rising effluent level in the lake.&#13;
While these measures will postpone the risk o f the improperly treated effluent over-flooding the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
embankments into local communities by a maximum o f 18 months, the lake is expected to&#13;
continue to grow through increasing inundation o f adjacent areas. These short-term measures&#13;
therefore need to be complemented by hrther robust actions to eliminate the risk o f flooding.&#13;
Such actions are planned under the proposedproject.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectObjectives&#13;
&#13;
36.     The primaryobjectives o f the project are to:&#13;
&#13;
       i)Mitigatetheimmediateandgatheringhealthandenvironmentalsafetythreatstothe&#13;
            communities surroundingthe effluent lake at BLWTP; and&#13;
        ii)Provide a satisfactory long-term solutionto the treatment ofwastewater for the&#13;
            Northern Governorate inGaza&#13;
&#13;
37.     These objectives will be pursued through the implementation o f a two-part closely&#13;
integrated program to deal with the impending threats and longer-term needs. Part A, is&#13;
designed to drain the lake, and thus alleviate the environmental andhealth threats associated with&#13;
the existing wastewater treatment plant. The effluent will be transferred to another site, where&#13;
new infiltration basins will be built. This will ensure that the immediate threat o f flooding posed&#13;
to the communities adjacent to the BLWTP and the backflows o f raw sewage in the sewerage&#13;
system are eliminated. Part B, will provide the longer-term solution to the wastewater treatment&#13;
issue in the northern Gaza area by commissioning a new wastewater treatment facility with&#13;
improved effluent quality standards.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
39.     The total Project cost is estimated at US$43.05 million, but financing has not yet been&#13;
confirmed for all project components.        However, given the immediate human health and&#13;
environmental risks associated with the effluent lake at Beit Lahia, it was agreed among PWA,&#13;
the Bank and other donors duringproject appraisal that implementationo f the Part A should start&#13;
as soon as possible through funds already available from the European Investment Bank (EIB)&#13;
loan, and from TFGWB with retroactive provisions capped at 20 percent o f the grant amount.&#13;
Funds from the French Development Agency (AFD), SIDA, and EC, which are likely to be&#13;
confirmed by June 2005, will be used to implement the treatment plant under Part B andpossibly&#13;
the provisional items under Part A, ifno other source o f fundingis secured. Fundingpermitting,&#13;
bothparts canbe implementedinparallel.&#13;
&#13;
40.      The mainproject components are outlinedbelow.&#13;
&#13;
PartA: Effluent Transfer&#13;
&#13;
     Component #I: Beit Lahia-Jabalya           Effluent Transfer (US$12.25 million including&#13;
    provisional items of US$1.85million).&#13;
&#13;
41.      This component will finance the mainpumpingstation, the transmission line to drain part&#13;
o f the lake and the infiltration basins which will be built at the site o f the planned North Gaza&#13;
Wastewater Treatment Plan (NGWTP). The activities implemented under this component will&#13;
be an integral part o f the new plant. However, untilthe plant is built, the effluent from the lake&#13;
will be pumpedto the infiltration basins in order to eliminate the immediate threat o f flooding&#13;
from the effluent lake into local communities.&#13;
&#13;
42.      Specifically the project will finance the construction of: (i)a terminal pumping station at&#13;
the site o f the existing BLWTP, with five pumps (four operational and one stand by) and a&#13;
capacity to pump 3,240 C M per hour at a pressure o f 6.2 bars; (ii)      a ductile iron sewage pipe&#13;
with about 8 kilometers inlengthto transfer the effluent from the lake to the infiltrationbasins; and&#13;
(iii) infiltrationbasinswithabaseareaofupto8hectareswillbebuiltattheproposedsite&#13;
     nine&#13;
o f the NGWTP inJabalya with an infiltration capacity o f 35,600 C M per day. Inaddition, this&#13;
component will cover costs related to operations and maintenance o f the infiltration basins for 24&#13;
months, including the monitoring o f effluent and ground water quality during the construction&#13;
period o f the new plant, and a coordinator for the maintenance o f the basins, equipment and&#13;
materials.&#13;
&#13;
43.      Note: The detailed designs for Part A are completed and tender documents are ready to&#13;
be launched usingWorld Bank Standard BiddingDocuments. It i s anticipated that the works for&#13;
this component will take up to one year to be completed. The volumetric discharge rate o fwater&#13;
to be pumped into the newly constructed infiltration basins will depend on the findings and&#13;
recommendations o f the Environmental Assessment (EA). The EA will include testing and&#13;
analysis o f the effluent, the ground water and the soil structure to determine the effects o f&#13;
effluent infiltration from the lake into the groundwater aquifer until the NGWTP i s operational.&#13;
Inaddition, the EA will recommend the balance betweenminimizing any adverse effects, while&#13;
ensuring that the threat o f flooding from the existing effluent lake to neighboring communities is&#13;
eliminated. Duringnegotiations, the PA indicated that the estimate for the infiltration basins had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 -13-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
been revised upwards by about US$1.8 million. The additional cost relates to ancillary items&#13;
indicated as "provisional items" in the tender documents and do not have a negative impact on&#13;
the overall performance o f the new infiltration basins. The PA is seeking additional fbding to&#13;
cover such provisional items.&#13;
&#13;
     Component #2: Technical Assistancefor the Implementation of Component 1 Activities&#13;
     (US$0.9million)&#13;
&#13;
44.     This component will finance the operation costs o f the Project Management Unit (PMU)&#13;
duringthe construction period o f component one, as well as the costs related to the supervision&#13;
o f the construction works. Inaddition, this component will finance an update o f the EA camed&#13;
out in 1999, to ensure its compliance with the requirements o f the Bank's Operational Policy on&#13;
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), as well as the costs related to the implementation o f the&#13;
environmental monitoring plan and detailed studies to be carried out for remedial works, which&#13;
will look into the detailed activities to be implemented to restore the lake areaback to its original&#13;
conditions.&#13;
&#13;
Part B: Treatment&#13;
&#13;
      Component #3: Construction of the NGWTP (US$28.30 million)&#13;
&#13;
45.     This component will finance the construction o f the NGWTP at the proposed site east o f&#13;
Jabalya. The plant has been designed for secondary biological treatment with nitrogen removal,&#13;
as well as sludge treatment, digestion, electricity generation, dewatering, drying and storage.&#13;
Treated effluent will be used to recharge the ground water through pumping it into the&#13;
infiltration basins, while treated sludge will be used for agriculture as fertilizer or soil&#13;
conditioner.&#13;
&#13;
46.     Inaddition, this component will finance materials and specialized labor for the operation&#13;
and maintenance o fthe NGWTP for two years after commissioning. These costs exclude cost o f&#13;
spareparts, which will beprocured as part o fthe contract for buildingthe NGWTP.&#13;
&#13;
47.      Finally, this component will finance the implementation o f the remedial works.         The&#13;
findings o fthe EA (expected to be completedbyearly January 2005) will give a better indication&#13;
interms o faltemative steps to betaken for future remedialworks at the BLWTP site. This work&#13;
will serve as aninputto the detailed remedialworks study financedunder Component 2.&#13;
&#13;
48.     Note: The final engineering designs o f the new treatment plant have been completed.&#13;
The tender documents have been substantially completed based on the European Commission&#13;
standard bidding guidelines. However, the tender documents will be revised at a later stage&#13;
when an agreement on the format o f biddingdocuments and the tendering process to be usedhas&#13;
been reached between all donors. The works for this component are expected to take up to two&#13;
years to be completed. The plant is designed with an ultimate capacity o f 69,000 C M per day&#13;
(6,480 C M per hour), to cope with sewage inflows projected to materialize in 2025. The plant&#13;
comprises five treatment modules to be constructed in two stages. The first stage will be&#13;
financed under this project, and consists o f the installation o f three modules, which will result in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 -14-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a plant capacity of 35,000 C M per day (3,600 C M per hour).         This will accommodate the&#13;
projected sewage flows for the year 2012. The second stage will be initiated in the year 2011&#13;
and consists o f implementing two other modules to reach an ultimate capacity o f 69,000 C M per&#13;
day. The required landfor the ultimate plant design has been acquired and is available; however,&#13;
additional land for further infiltration basins would be needed to cope with the long-term&#13;
.&#13;
expansion.&#13;
&#13;
    Component # 4: Technical Assistancefor the Implementation of Component 3 Activities&#13;
    (US$l.6million)&#13;
&#13;
49.    This component will be funded by TFGWB and will finance the operating costs o f the&#13;
PMU, the supervision o f construction works, as well as the implementation o f the environmental&#13;
monitoring plan duringthe constructionperiod o f Component 3.&#13;
&#13;
Key PerformanceIndicators&#13;
&#13;
50.    The performance indicators presented in Annex 1 will be confirmed by the&#13;
recommendations o f the EA, which will also enable the establishment o f baselines and&#13;
.&#13;
quantifiable targets for such indicators. The key indicators are shown below:&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
EnvironmentalAspects&#13;
&#13;
51.     The proposed project has been reviewed and i s classified as Category "A" under World&#13;
Bank Operational Policy (OP) 4.01 due to the potential environmental impacts associated with&#13;
the construction o f the NGWTP, the effluent recharge, and the re-use o f sludge. Despite these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 -15-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
potential negative impacts, the overall effect o f the project i s expected to have a strong positive&#13;
effect on the public health conditions and other natural environmental resources. A major long-&#13;
term benefit o f the project is the protection o f the groundwater resources from contamination and&#13;
the recharge o f the aquifer.     Other important benefits o f the project are the elimination o f&#13;
potential flooding from the effluent lake at Beit Lahia on adjacent lands and the re-use o f the&#13;
sludge generated byNGWTP.&#13;
&#13;
52.      The main potential negative impacts are associated with poor operational performance o f&#13;
the NGWTP, that could cause lower quality for treated effluent and for sludge leading to long-&#13;
term degradation inground water quality, soil quality and consequently risks for farmers. Inthe&#13;
short-term the potential degradation o f ground water quality from the drainage o f the effluent&#13;
lake before the completion o f the NGWTP i s also an important issue. Other environmental&#13;
concerns are related to inconvenience to be experienced during construction, such as disruption&#13;
o f traffic patterns, disrupted access to residential and/or other buildings, change inthe landscape&#13;
(loss o f vegetation), noise nuisance, air pollution due to dust formation, safety hazard from&#13;
constructionactivities and inappropriate disposal o f excavated materials andconstruction debris.&#13;
&#13;
53.       Mitigation and monitoring measures for the above described potential impacts will be&#13;
prepared as part o fthe Environmental Assessment (EA) Study that i s under preparationby PWA.&#13;
The primary objective o f the study is to review and update the existing EA report (1999) to&#13;
ensure full compliance with the requirements o f OP 4.01. The review o f the existing EA study&#13;
will be conducted in order to: (i)      incorporate any design changes that took place since the&#13;
preparation o f the EA completed in 1999, including the design changes for the emergency phase&#13;
of draining part o f the lake into the infiltration basins; (ii) that the project will not have&#13;
                                                                ensure&#13;
long-term irreversible negative impacts on the environment; (iii)identify both positive and&#13;
negative impacts; (iv) develop actions and measures to mitigate any negative impacts; (v) make&#13;
sure that all concerned stakeholders are aware o f the project, and their views and comments are&#13;
taken into consideration to the maximum extent possible.&#13;
&#13;
54.       As environmental issues are central to the design aspects o f the project, the EA is being&#13;
carried out on a fast-track basis, and all relevant issues are beingcoordinated inparallel with the&#13;
engineering and other technical preparation studies. Still as the project i s an emergency project&#13;
under OP 8.5, an exemption has been approved by the Middle East and North Africa Regional&#13;
Vice-president, to allow the disclosure o f the draft EA report shortly after the Board&#13;
presentation.&#13;
&#13;
55.       The terms o f reference for the EA assignment (Annex 5) were prepared by PWA and&#13;
subsequently shared and discussed with the donors and the GO1(through the Office o fthe Israeli&#13;
Water Commissioner). The draft EA is expected to be completed and disclosed to the public by&#13;
December 2004.&#13;
&#13;
Social Aspects&#13;
&#13;
56.       Social impacts will generally be positive, significant and sustainable. In particular, the&#13;
Project would reduce hardship by returning the living environment o f over 50,000 inhabitants o f&#13;
the Beit Lahia area to a safe and clean state. Safety and public health risks are expected to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    -16-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reduced dramatically. The restoration and reclamation o f the existing BLWTP site including the&#13;
effluent lake either to become green space for recreational and social usage or other planned&#13;
developments will yield additional socio-economic benefits to the residents o f the area.&#13;
Furthermore, the construction o f the new plant will ensure that the current and future needs in&#13;
wastewater treatment o fthe entire northem Gaza are met, and will facilitate the safe expansion o f&#13;
wastewater networks for all communities o fthe area.&#13;
&#13;
57.    The construction o f the NGWTP will ensure that the current and future needs in&#13;
wastewater treatment o f the entire north Gaza are met, and will facilitate the safe expansion o f&#13;
wastewater networks for all communities o f the area. This will also reduce the pollution o f the&#13;
region's groundwater resources and somewhat mitigate the rate o f depletion o f already highly&#13;
strained water aquifers, eventually also having a positive impact on the agriculture and potable&#13;
water supply sectors.&#13;
&#13;
LessonsLearnedfrom Similar Operations andUtilizedinProjectDesign&#13;
&#13;
58.    Important lessons have been leamed from the recent emergency operations in WB&amp;G&#13;
supported by the TFGWB. These relate in particular to decentralization o f project preparation&#13;
and implementation, which greatly facilitates implementationat a time when central systems are&#13;
unable to function effectively because o f the security situation.     Other lessons include the&#13;
following:&#13;
&#13;
     Existing consultative and coordination mechanisms such as the JWC and the Project              ,&#13;
     Coordination Committee (PCC), which bring together Palestinian and Israeli professionals&#13;
     periodically to discuss sector policies andproject issues must be utilized effectively.&#13;
&#13;
     Project design, management andprocurement strategies must exploit, or at least take heed o f&#13;
     the factors that foster success in the current context. Contracts for works and goods have&#13;
     been packaged in a manner that will maximize the use o f local contractors, which would&#13;
     help mitigate any implementationinterruptions duringclosures.&#13;
&#13;
     Finally, realistic contingency plans must be developed to deal with the various crises and&#13;
     blockages that may arise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SECTION   c.  INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS         AND PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
59.     Currently, the Palestinian entities whose mandates directly affect the water sector are: (i)&#13;
the National Water Council chaired by the President o f the Palestinian Authority and composed&#13;
o f 13 members representing public andprivate sectors; (ii)  PWA; and (iii) water utilities,&#13;
                                                                             various&#13;
joint service councils and municipalities covering different areas o f the WB&amp;G. PWA has&#13;
overall regulatory responsibility for the sector and provides policy guidance and support, as well&#13;
as coordinates the work o f donors who are active inthe sector.&#13;

&#13;
60.       For timely implementation o f the two parts o f the Project, the P W A will rely on the&#13;
existing PMU set up for this project in 2000.20 The P M U will take responsibility o f the day-to-&#13;
day implementation o f the Project and will comprise a core team o f a Project Director, two&#13;
engineers, two supervisors, one administrative assistant and one financial accountant. The core&#13;
team will be supplemented with consultants to carry out implementation supervision as needed&#13;
duringParts A andB.&#13;
&#13;
61.       The P M U will also be responsible for all project accounting; evaluations; monitoring o f&#13;
commitment/disbursement data and variation orders; noting deviations, if any, from the&#13;
implementation plan; and highlighting key issues and constraints and mitigation measures&#13;
planned and taken, to ensure the timely implementation o f project activities.          It will be&#13;
responsible for the selection and employment o f consultants and preparation o f contracts for the&#13;
1ocaL'intemational technical consulting firmskonsultants, in accordance with relevant Bank&#13;
guidelines. The PMUwill be required to submit a unified periodic progress report to donors, as&#13;
well as a detailed mid-termreport that would serve as the basis for a Project Mid-Term Review.&#13;
Finally, the PMUwill prepare and submit on behalf o f the PWA, the Borrower's contribution to&#13;
the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) to the Bank within four months o f the Project's&#13;
ClosingDate.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectImplementationPlan&#13;
&#13;
62.       A Project ImplementationPlan (PIP) was prepared by the PWA. The PIP complements&#13;
the Memorandum and Recommendation o f the President and this Technical Annex. It expands&#13;
on important implementation arrangements, and i s seen by PWA as a flexible implementation&#13;
tool that will be reviewed periodically and adjusted when warranted.         Staffing and key staff&#13;
positions for the PMU involved in implementation are described inthe PIP, which also includes&#13;
the role o f the other participants (various ministries and donors), and the coordination&#13;
mechanisms between the key stakeholders. The security modalities for project implementation&#13;
have been discussed and agreed and a field coordination mechanism in the form o f the Project&#13;
Coordination Committee (PCC) is in place. The PCC includes PWA, Israeli Authorities, the&#13;
Local Aid Coordination Committee (LACC) and the Bank.                 Moreover, the phasing and&#13;
packaging o f the project components were designed to facilitate quicker and smoother&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
63.       There will be a Project Launch Workshop within one month o f effectiveness.&#13;
Supervision missions will take place according to Project requirements. The Project mid-term&#13;
review i s tentatively scheduled for February 2006. The penultimate supervision mission would&#13;
beusedto launchthe preparationo fthe ICRwith PWA.&#13;

SECTION D. FINANCIAL          AND ECONOMIC   JUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
64.     The proposed emergency project is being prepared under emergency recovery assistance&#13;
procedures (OP 8.50).         Limited time and non-availability o f essential economic data prevent&#13;
further detailed financiaVeconomic analysis, a recognized constraint in preparing such&#13;
operations. However, a considerable amount o f analysis has been conducted by SIDA over the&#13;
past years and an economic rate o f return o f the project was estimated at 8.7 and 17.0 percent&#13;
against the Mekorot*l water price and seawater desalination costs, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SECTION E: MAJORSKS ANDBENEFITS&#13;
                         R I&#13;
&#13;
Risks&#13;
&#13;
65.     The Project faces significant risks during implementation, the major risk widely&#13;
acknowledged by the donor community being safety. This will be addressed inpart through the&#13;
existing framework o f the Task Force on Project Implementation (TFPI) set up to monitor the&#13;
implementation o f donor-funded projects, o f which the Bank i s a member. The fact that a field-&#13;
based project specific coordination mechanism through the PCC i s already in place, and four&#13;
other donors are participating in a coordinated effort will help maximize coordination with the&#13;
Israeli authorities whenever problems arise. Furthermore, the water andwastewater sector i s one&#13;
o f the few in which reasonable working relationships between Palestinian and Israeli&#13;
professionals still exist, and where consistent donor involvement has facilitated the dialogue&#13;
between the Palestinian and Israeli parties. However, PWA needs to continue to deepen the&#13;
dialogue with the relevant Israeli authorities, keeping them fully apprised o f plans and alerting&#13;
them promptly whenproblems arise.&#13;
&#13;
66.     The following specific risks have been identified along with measures to mitigate their&#13;
impact:&#13;
&#13;
     Sudden and catastrophic failure of the lake embankment.              While studies have been&#13;
     conducted to assess the time left before the lake waters could eventually overflow and flood&#13;
     the neighboring areas, many other unknown factors can interfere with such rough estimates.&#13;
     As such, unexpected failures can happen any time. Assurances were sought from PWA and&#13;
     PA to continuetheir ongoing efforts to strengthen the embankment aroundthe lake.&#13;
&#13;
     Delays in implementation due to financing issues. For the implementation o f Part A&#13;
     components, funds from the EIB will be used to start the work immediately. Retroactive&#13;
     financing o f up to 20 percent o f the total o f the proposed TFGWB financing has been&#13;
     agreed.    There is a risk o f delays in confirming donor funds for Part B components.&#13;
     However, this risk is mitigated by the active involvement o f the potential donors from the&#13;
     outset andtheir full appreciation o f the emergency needs o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
     Access of materials and contractors to the project sites. Based on their past and current&#13;
     experience, all stakeholders have agreed that the volatile security situation couldjeopardize&#13;
&#13;
''Mekorot is the Israeli water utility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 -19-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     smooth implementation, particularly if closures and curfews remain in effect for an&#13;
     indefinite period. A project-specific coordination mechanism (PCC) i s in place to ensure&#13;
     effective field coordination with the Israeli authorities on security arrangements during&#13;
     implementation and operation phases. Moreover, contracts for goods have beenpackaged in&#13;
     a manner that will maximize the use o f local contractors; this will help mitigate any&#13;
     interruptions inthe supply o f goods.&#13;
&#13;
     Movement of PMU officials: Freedom o f movement o f the PWA staff into and out o f Gaza&#13;
     may be impeded incase o f closures. The PCC andTFPImechanisms would be employed to&#13;
     facilitate such movements.&#13;
&#13;
     Project management: Multiple donors may strain the PMU's coordination capacity. The&#13;
     Bank and the other donors involved inthe project have therefore agreed to collaborate on an&#13;
     implementation framework that will facilitate effective coordination and management o f&#13;
     bothParts A andB o f the project including unified progress reporting, financial auditing and&#13;
     other fiduciary requirements as soon as the financing for the Part B is confirmed.&#13;
&#13;
     Sustainabiliq: Duringthe next few years before the NGWTP i s operational, a new project&#13;
     (proposed Gaza Emergency Water Project, FY05) will focus on functionally establishing the&#13;
     Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) as an effective and well-run utility by&#13;
     building its operational, managerial and financial capacity through a three-year&#13;
     performance-based       management    contract  with an international private operator.&#13;
     Furthermore, the project includes support for incremental operations and maintenance costs&#13;
     for the NGWTP during the first two years o f operations o f the NGWTP to lessen the&#13;
     financial impact o f assuming full responsibility for running the NGWTP on the newly&#13;
     created CMWU.&#13;
&#13;
     Reputational risk: By taking the lead as the coordinating and supervising agency for an&#13;
     emergency operation in a high-riskenvironment, the Bank exposes itself more than usual to&#13;
     reputational risk. Also, the fact that all donors have shared concerns around the&#13;
     sustainability o f the Project increases the pressure on the Bank to ensure that it attains&#13;
     satisfactory completion. The Task Teamhas ensured that all donors are being consulted and&#13;
     made part o f any key decision-making on the project design, institutional and financing&#13;
     arrangements, and implementation schedule. Donors will also be regularly informed o f the&#13;
     progress.&#13;
&#13;
Benefits&#13;
&#13;
67.     The provision o f adequate wastewater treatment and disposal will generate significant&#13;
economic, social and public health benefits, and will enable the PA to improve the enforcement&#13;
o f existing environmentalregulations. The following major benefits havebeen identified:&#13;
.    The Project i s expected to benefit a population o f about 300,000 people livinginBeit Lahia,&#13;
     Beit Hanoun, UmA1Nasser, and the Jabalya refugee camp. While the sewerage collection&#13;
     systems in the Northern Gaza area are relatively well developed with coverage o f about 75&#13;
     percent, there i s an urgent need to implement adequate treatment and disposal facilities. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                -20-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   existing treatment plant located in Beit Lahia i s operating at almost three times its design&#13;
   capacity, and no provision has been made for the safe disposal o f treated effluent. Because&#13;
   o f the deleterious effects o f the current state o f living conditions and the environment, the&#13;
   implementation o f the Project i s expected to generate significant health and environmental&#13;
   benefits.&#13;
&#13;
   A major benefit o f the project is the protection of groundwater from contamination by&#13;
   poorly treated sewage and the recharge o f the aquifer. As a result, economic benefits will&#13;
   occur interms o f increased volume o f good quality water and lower medical costs associated&#13;
   with the treatment o fwater-borne diseases.&#13;
&#13;
   Furthermore, it i s worth noting that the design o f the wastewater treatment plant has taken&#13;
   into consideration the digestion (for electricity generation) and use o f generated sludge with&#13;
   the aim o f protecting the environment. This will also have positive economic benefits to the&#13;
   farmers who are presently usingchemical fertilizers.&#13;
&#13;
   The project will generate substantial job opportunities duringthe construction period, which&#13;
   will have a significant impact on the depressed local economy.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
             Annex 3: FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
FinancialManagement&#13;
&#13;
1.      Summaiy: The financial management responsibilities will be vested in the PMU, which&#13;
has considerable experience in dealing with TFGWB-financed projects and will transmit this&#13;
experience to the permanent NGEST finance department that will be established by PWA to&#13;
support NGEST operations. The PMUhas inplace a computerized accounting system that meets&#13;
the project requirements. Payment process will follow the internal control procedures o f the&#13;
PWA. The financial management system at PWA was assessed in 1999 for the on-going&#13;
Southern Area Water and Sanitation Improvement Project (SAWSIP). All weaknesses identified&#13;
inthat assessmentwere properly addressedthrough a detailed capacitybuildingprogram, andthe&#13;
current financial management system inplace i s adequate.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Risk Assessment: The inherent risk is considered moderate as the recent CFAA has&#13;
recognized the recent developments in the government financial management system&#13;
incorporated in the on-going government reform program. The CFAA explicitly identified the&#13;
adequacy o f the government financial management framework and rated the overall financial&#13;
management risk as significant, which supports adjustment lendingand budgetary support to the&#13;
Palestinian Authority. The control risk is considered moderate due to adequate control systems&#13;
at PWA and the PMU, and the considerable experience o f the PWA and the in-house PMU in&#13;
implementing donor-financed projects including TFGWB. The detection risk is considered low&#13;
as the PMUhas an adequate financial management system and a qualified finance manager, and&#13;
works within the overall control framework o f the PWA.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Project Accounting and Records Management: Project accounts will be maintained by&#13;
the PMUon accrual basis following international accounting standards and subject to scrutiny o f&#13;
the PWA finance department. Financial records will also be maintained by the PMU. Upon&#13;
project completion all records will be kept at PWA for at least one year. As this is a multi-donor&#13;
financed project, the accounting system set up will accommodate all sources o f hnds to final&#13;
activities. Ifall donors agree to channel their funds through a trust fund managed by the Bank,&#13;
such trace o f sources anduses o f hnds will no longer be necessary (this will be determined when&#13;
donorfinancing is confirmed) .&#13;
&#13;
4.      Auditing: The project financial statements, including balance sheet' and cash flow&#13;
statements, will be annually audited by a qualified, independent auditor acceptable to the Bank&#13;
underterms ofreference acceptable to the Bank. The audit will be conducted inaccordance with&#13;
international standards on auditing and will cover financing provided by all sources. The audit&#13;
report would be submitted to the Bank within six months o fyear-end.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR): The PMU will prepare quarterly FMR, which&#13;
consist o f (i)statement o f cash receipt and expenditures for the period and cumulatively along&#13;
with explanations o f significant variances between budgeted and actual amounts, and cash&#13;
balances o f the project, (ii)&#13;
                             statement on procurement o f goods and works below the stated prior&#13;
review threshold, (iii)  physical progress containing actual progress on project implementation.&#13;
The formant and contents o f the FMRwill be agreed duringthe project launch.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               -25-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.      Flow of Funds: Inline with PA financial rules, TFGWB funds, as well as other donors'&#13;
funds, will be channeled to the project through a Special Account to be established under the&#13;
Central Treasury Account in the name o f the project. To simplify the disbursement process, the&#13;
Ministry o f Finance has agreed to allow the PMUPWA to withdraw funds directly from the&#13;
Special Account without a need to transfer the funds to a P W A expenditure account. Thus,&#13;
PMUPWA will be the sole signatory on the payments made from the Special Account.&#13;
Withdrawal Applications will be prepared and signed by the PMU and co-signed by the PWA&#13;
and the Ministry o f Finance within five business days. The Ministry o f Finance will review&#13;
supporting documents o f Withdrawal Applications on an ex-post basis, except for the last&#13;
Withdrawal Application, which would be made on ex-ante basis.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Disbursement: Disbursement for the project will be based on transaction-based&#13;
disbursement methods including, replenishments to the Special Account and reimbursements&#13;
with full documentation, or statements o f expenditure (SOE), direct payments and special&#13;
commitments issued against letters of credit. The limits of expenditure amount that can be&#13;
claimed under SOE are (i)          goods less than US$lOO,OOO, (ii) less than US$ 200,000, (iii)&#13;
                                                                                     works&#13;
consulting firms less than US$lOO,OOO and individual consultants less than US$50,000. Table 2&#13;
below describes the allocation o f Grant proceeds.&#13;
&#13;
8.      VAT: To avoid any VAT refund to contractors and suppliers, the Ministry o fFinance had&#13;
agreed to issue VAT exemption for the project. A VAT exemption letter signed by the Minister&#13;
o fFinance, dated June 17,2004 was provided duringnegotiations.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Supervision: Financial management supervision will be conducted inaccordance with the&#13;
Bank guidelines and procedures by a financial management specialist, financial management&#13;
analyst and disbursement staff.               The project will be visited at least twice a year. Financial&#13;
management supervision mission reports will be made available to other financiers, through the&#13;
project team leader.&#13;

inaccordance withrelevantWorld BankGuidelines.&#13;
&#13;
B. Assessment of the Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement&#13;
&#13;
6.      Procurement activities will be carried out by PWA. The agency is staffed by a project&#13;
director, technical staff and administration and financial staff and the procurement unit is staffed&#13;
by one procurement officer. Since it was established, PWA has been working bilaterally with a&#13;
number o f donor countries and international agencies including the Bank. It has capable and&#13;
experienced staff that have carried out and implemented procurement processes in accordance&#13;
with different donor procurement rules and regulations. PWA has previous experience with&#13;
World Bank/IDA procurement guidelines through other Bank projects, such as the Municipal&#13;
Infrastructure Development Project (MIDP II),         Gaza Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
(WSSP), Southern Area Water and Sanitation Improvement Project (SAWSIP) and the recent&#13;
Emergency Water Project (EWP).&#13;
&#13;
7.      An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agency to implement procurement&#13;
actions for the project was carried out for the WSSP andhas been updated on July 1,2004. The&#13;
assessment reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project, and the&#13;
interaction between the project's staff responsible for procurement and the PWA's relevant&#13;
central unit for administration and finance. The first Country Procurement Assessment Review&#13;
(CPAR) i s planned to be completedby October 2004.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Most o f the procurement issuedrisks have been identified. These include: a) lack o f a&#13;
standard NCB package and b) security conditions that may impact bid submissions, contract&#13;
management and completion o f projects. The corrective measure agreed to i s to use the Bank's&#13;
standard biddingdocuments until standard biddingdocuments are prepared as a follow up o f the&#13;
CPAR recommendations. The overall project risk for procurement i s Average.&#13;
&#13;
C. ProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
9.      The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation,&#13;
which provides the basis for the procurement methods.          This plan was agreed between the&#13;
Palestinian Authority andthe Project Team on June 30, 2004, and is available at the PWA office&#13;
inGaza. It will also be available inthe Project's database and inthe Bank's external website.&#13;
The Procurement Planwill beupdated inagreement with the project team annually or as required&#13;
to reflect the actual project implementationneeds andimprovements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;

D. Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision&#13;
&#13;
10.     In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from the Bank office, the&#13;
capacity assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended supervision mission to visit&#13;
the field once every six months to carry out post review o fprocurement actions. The post review&#13;
would cover a random sample o f about 10 percent o f the number o f contracts that are subject to&#13;
post review.&#13;

also be responsible for collecting information and data on best practices, potential impacts and&#13;
mitigation measures adopted in the infiltration and recharge o f treated effluent inneighborhood&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Specific Environmental Issues to be addressed should be identifiedby the consultant but&#13;
could tentatively be summarized as shownbelow.&#13;
&#13;
                construction impacts,&#13;

            quality; existing emissions to the environment).&#13;
&#13;
9.      Inthe context of the proposed project, it is expected that this review would include an&#13;
analysis, covering the project area, of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0    Groundwater quality;&#13;
&#13;
        0    Wastewater treatment and disposal, i.e., present levels o f service by wastewater&#13;
             treatment plant; present disposal routes for treated and untreated wastewater and&#13;
             impacts o f discharges o f wastewater to the receiving water environment;&#13;

        0   Agricultural areas, types of grown crops and soil structure;&#13;
&#13;
        0   Industrial activities as well as quantities and type of generated effluent.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Environmental     Benefits. A quantitative assessment o f the environmental benefits&#13;
resulting from the implementation o f the project. This should include, but not limited to, an&#13;
assessment o f&#13;
&#13;
        0   Improvements in groundwater quantity and quality - recharging the aquifer and&#13;
             reducing the risk o f groundwater pollution and the associated potential loss o f&#13;
             resource through contamination.&#13;
&#13;
        0   Reduction inpublic health risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                -33-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            Economic impacts - generation o f employment, reduction inthe cost o f environment&#13;
            degradation, reduction in the cost o f treating water born diseases, reduction in the&#13;
            use o fhigher cost alternative water sources.&#13;
&#13;
11.    Environmental Impacts. - Identification and quantitative assessment o f the negative&#13;
impacts likely to result from the proposed project.        This should include changes in the&#13;
environment resulting from project development and operation and an assessment o f the effect&#13;
on the surrounding physical, biological, and human systems. Appropriate mitigation measures&#13;
and any residual negative impacts that cannot effectively be mitigated should be identified. The&#13;
analysis should also identify or estimate any uncertainties associated with predictions that arise&#13;
as a consequence o f lack o f availability o fkey data.&#13;
&#13;
12.    It is expected that, for a wastewater project, potential key issues and impacts could&#13;
include:&#13;
&#13;
            Impact of discharge of treated wastewater on receiving water quality.            This i s&#13;
            important in the context o f aquifer recharge with treated wastewater.         Specific&#13;
            attention is drawn to the impact from the transfer and discharge o f the lake into the&#13;
            groundwater. Untilthe new wastewater treatment plant is operational and based on&#13;
            the effluent quality inthe lake and the ground water quality, the impact o f infiltrating&#13;
            various quantities o f effluent from the lake should be computed and a management&#13;
            plan for emptying the lake without causing any impact on the ground water should&#13;
            be developed. On the other hand and while the provision o f a new wastewater&#13;
            treatment plant represents an improvement relative to the present situation, an&#13;
            analysis is required as to whether this represents a sustainable long-term solution.&#13;
            This analysis should consider, for example, whether existing wastewater discharge&#13;
            standards are appropriate, taking into account the implications o f aquifer recharge&#13;
            and therefore whether additional treatment is required. The salinity o f the treated&#13;
            effluent and its impact on the aquifer should also be assessed.&#13;
&#13;
            Impact of disposal of sludgefrom wastewater treatment - impact o f sludge transport&#13;
            andreuse; disposal o f sludge incase o f non-compliance with reuse standards.&#13;
&#13;
            Impacts of discharge of industrial effluent onperformance of wastewater treatment&#13;
            plant.&#13;
&#13;
            Impacts of construction - constructioddemolition spoil disposal; disruption to&#13;
            community services; noise andodor associatedwith wastewater treatment plant.&#13;
&#13;
 13.   Analysis of Alternatives to the Proposed Project. Alternatives to the proposed project&#13;
andits components that were evaluated inproject development and designmustbedescribed and&#13;
any alternatives identified that would achieve the same project objectives. There must be a&#13;
systematic comparison o f these identified alternatives in respect o f project design, siting,&#13;
technology selection, construction techniques and operational factors for wastewater treatment&#13;
anddisposal, andsludge management interms o f&#13;
&#13;
            environmental impact (assuming reasonable implementation o f mitigation measures&#13;
            and identifying which impacts cannot be mitigated);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  -34-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        0    cost (capital, operating and 1and);and&#13;
&#13;
        0    institutional, training and monitoring requirements.&#13;
&#13;
14.     Environmental costs and benefits should be quantified to the extent possible, with&#13;
economic values attached where feasible. The basis for the selection o f the proposed project&#13;
concept and design must be clearly stated and justified. The analysis o f alternatives should&#13;
include also an assessment o fthe environmentalimplications o f a `no project' situation.&#13;
&#13;
15.    Environmental ManagementPlan (EMP). The implementationo fthis planis the means&#13;
by which the adverse environmental impacts of a project, that are acceptable subject to&#13;
mitigation measures, are in practice effectively mitigated and by which the effectiveness o f the&#13;
mitigation i s monitored. Such plan i s an essential element o f a Category `A' project.       The&#13;
preparation o f the plan should involve the identification o f feasible and cost-effective measures&#13;
that may prevent or reduce potentially significant adverse environmental impacts to acceptable&#13;
levels; the requirements for ensuring that these responses are made effectively and in a timely&#13;
manner; and estimation o fthe capital and recurrent costs o f the responses.&#13;
&#13;
16.     The EMP should include details o f the management initiatives to be implemented during&#13;
both the construction and operational phases o f the project. The EMP will need to account for&#13;
monitoring o f environmental parameters and the influence o f mitigation measures on&#13;
environmental impacts. The following items shouldbe included:&#13;
&#13;
             Identification andsummary o f all significant expected environmental impacts;&#13;
             Detailed technical description o f each proposed mitigation measure, including the&#13;
             impact to which it relates and the conditions under which it is required (e.g.,&#13;
             continuous, intermittent or inthe event o f contingencies);&#13;
             Institutional arrangements for implementation o f the mitigation measures and&#13;
             responsibilities for operation, supervision, enforcement, monitoring andreporting;&#13;
             Implementation schedule showing phasing and co-ordination with overall project&#13;
             implementationwhere appropriate;&#13;
             Monitoringand reportingprocedures; and&#13;
             Cost estimates o f mitigation and monitoring and identificatiodconfirmation o f&#13;
             funding sources for implementationo fthe plan.&#13;
&#13;
 17.    It is expected that the EMP for the proposed project would include and address&#13;
effectively the following issues:&#13;
&#13;
        0    Construction spoil management - where quantities o f constructioddemolition spoil&#13;
             significantly exceed local requirements in construction, a Spoil Management Plan is&#13;
             required;&#13;
&#13;
        0    Urban disruption during construction (e.g., traffic, noise, interruption to transport&#13;
             and access), including limitations on specific construction practices and activities&#13;
             and on working hours, and effective public information;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 -35-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             Feasible measures for addressing the discharge o f effluent in case any o f the&#13;
             following scenarios occur: (a) shutdown of the treatment plant; (b) lower quality&#13;
             treated effluent than what i s required; (c) lower than expected infiltration and aquifer&#13;
             capacity, which might lead to overflowing.&#13;
&#13;
             Specific wastewater treatment and monitoring requirements for recharge o f aquifer&#13;
             with treated wastewater;&#13;
             A formal Sludge Management Plan to demonstrate the environmental acceptability&#13;
             andsustainabilityo fthe proposed disposal routes;&#13;
             Controls and management procedures for reuse o f sludge inagriculture; and&#13;
&#13;
             Noise and odor control at wastewater treatment plant through careful siting, process&#13;
             and equipment selection anduse o fbuffer zones.&#13;
&#13;
18.     In addition to strengthen capabilities in the agencies responsible for implementation at&#13;
local or national level; the EMP should also address the key issues o f environmental&#13;
management and monitoring as follows:&#13;
&#13;
19.     Environmental Management and Training. The existence, role and capabilities o f&#13;
environmental agencies at local and national levels are to be evaluated, and based on this&#13;
evaluation, recommendations made in respect o f establishment, expansion and training o f such&#13;
unitsso that EArecommendations canbeimplemented.&#13;
&#13;
20.     Environmental Monitoring.            The requirements for the effective environmental&#13;
monitoring to establish the effectiveness o f the project andor the proposed mitigation measures&#13;
are to be specified together with the agencies to be responsible, the prospective costs and any&#13;
other requirements such as training and equipment. Monitoring should ascertain compliance&#13;
with agreed standards o f effluent discharge, and serve as an analytical support tool for achieving&#13;
optimal operational performance.     A listing o f typical monitoring parameters and frequencies&#13;
should beprovided.&#13;
&#13;
21.      Consultation of    relevant Stakeholders.         Concerned governmental organizations,&#13;
representatives from local governments, residents o f the project area, academic and research&#13;
institutes, non-governmental organizations and interested individual citizens should be consulted&#13;
throughout the preparation o f the EA report. Inclose cooperation with the client, the consultant&#13;
should prepare a program for public participation andconsultation. The program should describe&#13;
approach, frequency, and substantive issues to be discussed with concemed stakeholders.&#13;
Formal records should be made from each meeting including agenda, list o f participants,&#13;
summary o f issues discussed and copies o f materials provided to the participants. Upon the&#13;
completion o f the draft EA report, the executive summary should be translated to Arabic and a&#13;
public hearing should be held for presenting the findings and recommendations o f the consultant&#13;
at the end o f the EA process. Inaddition, through PWA, the consultant shall consult and share&#13;
the findings o fthe EAwith the Joint Water Committee.&#13;

            West Bank and Gaza - North Gaza Emergency
            Sewage Treatment Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The North Gaza Emergency Sewage
            Treatment Project aims to (a) mitigate the immediate and
            impending health, environmental and safety threats to the
            communities surrounding the poorly treated and rapidly
            growing sewage lake in the Beit Lahia area of northern Gaza;
            and to (b) contribute to the provision of a satisfactory
            long-term solution for the treatment of wastewater in the
            Northern Gaza Governorate. The proposed project would
            finance a closely integrated two-part program to deal with
            the impending threats and longer-term wastewater treatment
            needs, as follows:  Part A is designed to drain the lake and
            thus alleviate the environmental and health threats
            associated with the existing wastewater treatment plant at
            Beit Lahia. It comprises two components. Component 1, Beit
            Lahia- Jabalva Effluent Transfer, consists of (1)
            constructing a terminal pumping station at the site of the
            existing Beit Lahia wastewater treatment plant; (2)
            constructing about 8 kilometers of ductile iron sewage
            pipeline to transfer the effluent from the existing lake to
            the infiltration basins; (3) constructing nine infiltration
            basins with a capacity of 35,000 cubic meters per day; and
            (4) operating and maintaining costs related to the new
            infiltration basins, for 24 months. Component 2, Technical
            Assistance for Part A, consists of (1) supporting the
            Project Management Unit during the construction period of
            Component; (2) construction supervision costs; (3) update of
            the existing Environmental Assessment, carried out in 1999;
            and, (4) costs related to the implementation of the
            environmental monitoring plan and detailed studies to be
            carried out for remedial works to restore the existing Beit
            Lahia wastewater treatment site.  Part B will contribute to
            the provision of the medium/longer-term wastewater treatment
            solution for the whole of North Gaza. It comprises two
            components. Component 3, Construction of the North Gaza
            Wastewater Treatment Plant, consisting of (1) building the
            wastewater treatment plant; (2) providing materials and
            specialized labor for the operation and maintenance for two
            years after commissioning; and, and (3) implementing
            remedial works on the existing Beit Lahia wastewater
            treatment plant site, including the effluent lake. Component
            4, Technical Assistance for the Implementation of Part B,
            consisting of (1) supporting the Project Management Unit
            during the construction period of Component 3; (2)
            construction supervision costs; and (3) implementation of
            the environmental monitoring plan during the construction
            period of Component 3.
