CONCEPTUALIZING IUWM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Population growth is a major factor in urbanization processes, and expanding cities&#13;
can act as engines of economic growth. However, many challenges affect the provision&#13;
of urban services such as solid waste, water supply, and wastewater collection. The&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water Partnership Program (WPP) has supported the development of an&#13;
emerging integrated urban water management (IUWM) framework that can be used&#13;
to optimize a response to those challenges. The WPP has supported several case&#13;
studies in Latin America and the Caribbean (LCR), Europe and Central Asia (ECA), and&#13;
sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;

The world is becoming more urban. According to the 2009             100&#13;
World Development Report, in 1900 only 4.3 percent of                                  83               84                85                86&#13;

population. The United Nations predicts that by 2030 more&#13;
                                                                     60&#13;
people will live in cities than in rural areas in every region of&#13;
the world (UN-HABITAT 2008). In 2011, cities with 1 million                                                   41                43&#13;

inhabitants and more accounted for 40 percent of the                 40&#13;
worldâ&#128;&#153;s urban population, and by 2025 they are expected&#13;
to account for 47 percent. Regionally, Asia is expected              20&#13;
to see its population increase by 1.4 billion, Africa by 0.9&#13;

OVERVIEW OF IUWM PROJECTS&#13;
IN THREE REGIONS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The WPP has funded activities on integrated urban water management in Latin American&#13;
and the Caribbean (LCR), Europe and Central Asia (ECA), and sub-Saharan Africa. The&#13;
initiative in Latin America and the Caribbean focused on the IUWM implementation&#13;
process and served to develop a conceptual framework and implementation guide for&#13;
integrated urban water management. It also studied five cases where different challenges&#13;
have undermined the capacities of local and national governments to provide sustainable&#13;
urban services, as well as social and environmental benefits for the targeted populations.&#13;
In Europe and Central Asia, the focus was on formulating an IUWM strategy for Baku,&#13;
Azerbaijan, that included a study of the willingness to pay for improved water services&#13;
and a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) strategy. In four cases studied in sub-Saharan Africa,&#13;
the project emphasized alternative planning processes and different technical and cost&#13;
solutions for supplying water and providing wastewater services following IUWM strate-&#13;
gies. This chapter provides more details on each of these activities.&#13;

for cities wishing to develop IUWM strategies. The purpose&#13;
of this exercise was to articulate the concept of IUWM and        2.1.1 Using Case Studies to Highlight IUWM Challenges&#13;
the linkage between urban water services, urban develop-          and Good Practices&#13;
ment, and river basin considerations, and to ground it in&#13;
specific case studies.                                            The WPPâ&#128;&#153;s support was formulated under the Blue Water&#13;
                                                                  â&#128;&#147; Green Cities initiative, which helped create a knowledge&#13;
The first step was to test the preparation of a preliminary       base to assist municipal actors in addressing urban water&#13;
methodology to assess and evaluate IUWM alternatives in           challenges by working across sectors. These case studies&#13;

milestones to be considered when engaging in IUWM for&#13;
decision-making purposes (World Bank 2012a).                      The calculation of costs associated with IUWM activities&#13;

The selection of cities in LCR had as its aim to facilitate the   future IUWM options. Part of the IUWM study for Aracaju,&#13;
sharing of cross and intra-regional experience on integrated      Brazil, and Asuncion, Paraguay, created cost estimates for&#13;
urban water management. It was based on the following             IUWM activities in these two cities (figure 6). These cost&#13;
criteria (World Bank 2012a):                                      estimates present important intervals of variation due to&#13;

Integrated urban water management in GBA is of special&#13;
significance for three reasons (World Bank 2011). First, the                        The identification of potential economic benefits and&#13;

5. The uses of water can be associated with the provision of goods (e.g. drinking water, irrigation water) and services (e.g. hydroelectricity generation or&#13;
recreational uses) to agriculture, industry, and households. The values people assign directly and indirectly to these goods and services are reflected in their&#13;
willingness to pay (WTP) (Scandizzo and Abbasov 2012).&#13;

consumption for the 31 cities studied is 65.7 liters per capita&#13;

&#13;
A number of valuable global lessons and overall strategies can be extracted from the&#13;
case studies and projects in the three regions. The operationalization of IUWM and the&#13;
knowledge that is being generated need to be continued and expanded. This can be&#13;
done through additional research, capacity building, and the practical application of the&#13;
IUWM approach to more cases..&#13;

&#13;
A survey was carried out in Baku as part of the WPP-funded                    find out how respondents form their expectations on the&#13;
activities to improve the quality and reliability of water                    use of water and whether those expectations satisfy broad&#13;
supply, establish effective sanitation services, and expand                   hypotheses of economic rationality (coordination between&#13;
the range of environmental benefits for coastal and inland                    ends and means, consistency, pursuit of individual and&#13;
water. The survey campaign lasted about six weeks and a                       communal benefits, awareness of alternative options, search&#13;
total of 2,155 questionnaires were completed.                                 for information and knowledge).&#13;
&#13;
The interviewees, who comprised a cross section of water                      The results of the survey show an average willingness to pay&#13;
users, were asked if they would agree to an increase in their                 (WTP) an increased tariff for an immediate improvement&#13;
monthly water bill to contribute to investments to-wards                      in water supply services (24-hour supply) of about US$19&#13;
improving water supply, wastewater treatment, and environ-                    (table 1). The average WTP drops to $11.60 for a long-term&#13;

The options for new infrastructure provided in the survey                     would be willing to pay to avoid further service deterioration.&#13;
ranged from a traditional water supply network to a fully                     The willingness to pay for service improvements extends to&#13;
integrated multifunctional model (water management and                        wastewater disposal, both in the immediate action scenario&#13;
waterfront use). Survey questions were also designed to                       and that including uncertainty and delayed investments.&#13;

            The purpose of this report is to review
            a set of Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM)
            initiatives and pilot studies funded by the World Bank&#146;s
            Water Partnership Program (WPP) in Latin America and the
            Caribbean, Europe, and Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
            The structure of this report is as follows. Chapter 1
            introduces the main concepts of IUWM and describes the
            principal components for the operationalization of IUWM.
            Chapter 2 reviews the findings of 10 case studies in three
            regions: Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Central
            Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. This chapter also reviews the
            main aspects of each project and highlights their principal
            contributions to the general understanding of IUWM. Finally,
            chapter 3 puts forward a set of recommenda¬tions to sustain
            and enhance the scope of IUWM activi¬ties, and describes how
            the World Bank and its Water Partnership Program can
            facilitate the piloting, operational¬ization, and scale up
            of IUWM.
