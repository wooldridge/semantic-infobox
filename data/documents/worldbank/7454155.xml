DOES TRAINING WORK? RE-EXAMINING DONOR-SPONSORED&#13;
TRAINING PROGRAMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
&#13;
By Mark Nelson, World Bank Institute&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       This article examines the available evidence about training as an instrument of capacity development&#13;
     and asks whether it works and under which conditions it is most optimally pursued. The first part of&#13;
     the paper considers evidence from the World Bank and other international donors, which spend consid-&#13;
     erable sums on training in developing countries. The second part of the paper looks at the record of pri-&#13;
     vate sector firms to see what can be learned from company training programs, which have tended to be&#13;
     better documented and followed from a cost-effectiveness standpoint. The article then considers what&#13;
     conclusions from the private sector can help us toward a better understanding of the optimal conditions&#13;
     for training in a development context.&#13;

  Technical Cooperation Spending: the Data Puzzle&#13;
&#13;
    Bilateral donors currently spend roughly $20 billion annually on a category of assistance known as technical cooperation, defined by&#13;
  the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) as "the provision of know-how in the form of personnel, training, research, and associated&#13;
  costs." For many years, this category of spending has been considered by donor agencies as the closest approximation of spending--at&#13;
  the input level, at least--on capacity development.&#13;
    Closer scrutiny of this spending, however, suggests that it is not a good proxy for spending on capacity development. Indeed, a number&#13;
  of studies suggest that technical cooperation--also known as technical assistance--is not always associated with capacity development&#13;
  objectives. And even those components of technical cooperation that are clearly capacity related are only a part of the overall effort aimed&#13;
  at capacity development.&#13;
    A number of donors have looked in detail at their own technical cooperation spending. Most of these analyses have concluded that the&#13;
  impact of technical cooperation is mixed and at times has been associated with some of the negative outcomes of donor assistance. No&#13;
  major study has found that increasing spending on technical cooperation has been associated with better outcomes on capacity develop-&#13;
  ment.*&#13;
    Most donors have found that a majority of their technical cooperation spending goes to experts who may or may not be working to&#13;
  develop capacity in countries. Many technical assistance experts substitute for, rather than developing, local expertise. And much of the&#13;
  training that takes place using these funds is poorly integrated with the broader development agenda of the partner countries. Until&#13;
  donors have better data on their spending, however, getting a clear idea of how to remedy these problems will be difficult.&#13;
    DAC has suggested that the data could eventually be sorted into categories such as (a) support to students and trainees, (b) supply of&#13;
  technical experts, teachers, and volunteers, (c) development research, and (d) institutional capacity development projects, which could&#13;
  incorporate elements of the first two categories, but are separately identifiable as specific technical cooperation projects. In addition, DAC&#13;
  has suggested that donors undertake a more consistent flagging of free-standing technical cooperation and investment-related technical&#13;
  cooperation, which is linked to projects or programs.&#13;
&#13;

    *A 2001 internal study by the Canadian International Development Agency revealed that between 65 and 75 percent of its technical cooperation budgets was funding&#13;
  "experts." See also Gareth Williams, Stephen Jones, Val Imber, and Astrid Cox (2003), "A Vision for the Future of Technical Assistance in the International Development&#13;

     Lessons learned about capacity development through long-term training&#13;
&#13;
       USAID's African Graduate Fellowship (AFGRAD) and African Training for Leadership and Advanced Skills (ATLAS) programs&#13;
     were evaluated over the period 1962-2003. The following are some of the lessons drawn:&#13;
&#13;
     · It is better to aim at changes in key organizations than to focus on improving the capacity of individuals. Not only does this lead&#13;
       to improvements in organizational performance, but the impact on the individuals is more beneficial.&#13;
     · The gains to individuals of long-term overseas training abroad include changes in work attitudes, critical thinking, and other&#13;
       "non-technical" attributes (such as self-confidence). These qualities may be less easily instilled by short-term training, yet they&#13;
       may be among the most important for making a measurable difference in trainees' home countries.&#13;
     · Having a critical mass of staff in a particular organization that have been trained abroad in the same country may be a factor in&#13;
       making changes more possible, more sustainable and more effective. If so, this is an additional factor in favor of a long-term and&#13;
       selective approach targeted at key organizations.&#13;
     · The costs of different training options should be assessed in relation to the desired impact. Of critical importance is the cost of&#13;
       obtaining the desired impact, not the cost of providing the training.&#13;
     · Follow-up support in organizations where trainees are employed should be factored into programs. Maintaining contact with&#13;
       returned trainees can help those who encounter difficulties in introducing changes in their workplaces, a situation reported partic-&#13;
       ularly by women. This, too, calls for a long-term commitment by the donor.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This article examines the available
            evidence about training as an instrument of capacity
            development and asks whether it works and under which
            conditions it is most optimally pursued. The first part of
            the paper considers evidence from the World Bank and other
            international donors, which spend considerable sums on
            training in developing countries. The second part of the
            paper looks at the record of private sector firms to see
            what can be learned from company training programs, which
            have tended to be better documented and followed from a
            cost-effectiveness standpoint. The article then considers
            what conclusions from the private sector can help us toward
            a better understanding of the optimal conditions for
            training in a development context.
