REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA&#13;
SOCIAL POLICY AND COMMUNITY SOCIAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND AND ISSUES&#13;
A. The Economy&#13;
1.1   By 1990, Lithuania had undergone some fifty years of development under central&#13;
planning, with an export-oriented industrial base that was highly integrated with the other&#13;
republics of the Soviet Union, favorable terms of trade with those republics, a high level of&#13;
energy dependence on Russia, a skilled work force and a relatively developed infrastructure.&#13;
Severe economic and social shocks followed Lithuania's emergence as an independent state --&#13;
as a result, the country suffered a precipitous decline in output, with GDP falling some 13&#13;
percent in real terms in 1991, 38 percent in 1992, and 16 percent in 1993. With&#13;
independence, the Government embarked on a comprehensive reform agenda aimed at&#13;
reorienting to a market economy. A formal stabilization program was launched in October,&#13;
1992, and Lithuania has broadly remained within program targets, containing both monetary&#13;
expansion and the fiscal deficit. Notable progress has been made in the areas of fiscal&#13;
policy, currency and price reform, privatization, social safety net reform, and trade&#13;
liberalization. A new currency, the litas, was adopted in June, 1993, and was pegged to the&#13;
US$ at a rate of 4:1 under a currency board system in April, 1994. While there have been&#13;
periodic setbacks in the areas of privatization, banking, and trade reform, the country&#13;
succeeded in reversing the GDP decline with growth of about 1.5 percent in 1994 and 2.7&#13;
percent in 1995, and inflation has been reduced to single digit monthly levels (from about 50&#13;
percent in the first quarter of 1992). New private sector activity is growing and absorbing an&#13;
increasing percentage of the work force.&#13;
B. Social Safety Net Policy Development&#13;
1.2   During the transition to market, shifts in relative prices and other incentives that&#13;
accompany structural changes in the economy (such as the removal of subsidies) impose costs&#13;
on some households, and can particularly impact the poor and those at the margin. As the&#13;
Government continues to reduce its role as the redistributor of national income, it has&#13;
become increasingly important to establish a fiscally sound social safety net that targets&#13;
Lithuania's scarce social protection resources on the most vulnerable, reinforced by client-&#13;
responsive programs that support the productivity, dignity, and quality of life of the&#13;
individual.&#13;
1.3   Before independence, Lithuania's social security system was integrated with the social&#13;
programs of the Soviet Union, financed through the state budget, and regulated from&#13;
Moscow. This system was oriented to central planning, and assumed (i) almost full&#13;
employment; (ii) heavily subsidized basic commodities; and (iii) widespread access to almost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
free (if generally low quality) services such as health care and education. After&#13;
independence, the Government introduced changes in the structure, financing, and&#13;
administration of the social programs it had inherited, hoping both to address its perception&#13;
that living standards were falling sharply for many households and to introduce social&#13;
insurance programs that were fiscally sustainable and directly linked to contributions.&#13;
Currently, three types of cash benefits are provided:&#13;
a.    social insurance benefits, which are based on contributions to the Social&#13;
Insurance Fund, and include old age, disability and survivors' pensions, short&#13;
term sickness and maternity benefits, unemployment benefits, and funeral&#13;
benefits;&#13;
b.    state allowances and pensions, with universal eligibility once certain conditions&#13;
are met including childbirth grant, extended maternity leave (childcare&#13;
benefit), foster care benefits, and pensions for special groups including&#13;
military and professors; and&#13;
C.    means tested allowances, which includes a general benefit and a winter heating&#13;
allowance.&#13;
The Government has been unable to measure the impact of these programs on household&#13;
income and consumption until recently, when the outmoded Soviet-era Household Budget&#13;
Survey was replaced with a more reliable instrument (see Para. 1.15, page 5).&#13;
1.4   The cost of social insurance benefits has been rising rapidly, despite continued policy&#13;
development. In 1993, an estimated 6.6 percent of GDP was spent on these benefits. Of&#13;
this, social insurance benefits (covering some 23 percent of the population) accounted for 5.7&#13;
percent of GDP, and the others 0.9 percent of GDP. The cost of social insurance benefits&#13;
rose to an estimated 8.7 percent of GDP in 1995 owing to the increase in pension benefits&#13;
granted in the 1994 social insurance legislation. While the new legislation has a number of&#13;
positive features, including universality and increased transparency, the entitlements provided&#13;
will cause costs to continue to climb over the medium term.&#13;
1.5   Prior to independence, Lithuania had an extensive, though austere and authoritarian,&#13;
system of social supports for well-functioning families, including creches, day care centers,&#13;
extensive public health care, after-school programs and summer recreation. But when&#13;
families or the elderly had severe difficulties, almost no forms of community-based help&#13;
(which can include a range of services such as counselling, job training, child care, and&#13;
material assistance) were available. The primary means of assistance was, and still is,&#13;
removal of children and placement in kinship foster families or institutional placement of&#13;
children, the disabled, or the elderly.&#13;
C. Institutional Structure&#13;
1.6   Ministry of Social Security and Labor. The MSSL, which is responsible for the&#13;
development, monitoring, and evaluation of social policy, is divided into three departments:&#13;
Income Guarantee, Social Care, and Employment (see Chart 1, page 49). The Income&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
Guarantee Department is responsible for social insurance and (cash) social assistance policy&#13;
design, implementation, and monitoring. The Department's Social Indicators Division&#13;
supports policy development in the Ministry, assessing minimum living standards and other&#13;
indicators used in benefit formulae, while the Division of Family Assistance develops and&#13;
monitors family assistance, maternity, and children's benefits. The Department of Social&#13;
Care oversees the operations of institutions for the elderly, invalids, and handicapped&#13;
children (especially drafting standards and guidelines) and also oversees the activities of the&#13;
Ministry training center. The Employment Department oversees the development of active&#13;
and passive labor market policies.&#13;
1.7   Social assistance. Means-tested social assistance entitlements are determined by&#13;
national legislation, but the implementation of this legislation is the responsibility of the&#13;
municipalities, using funds from their own budgets (which in turn are funded in part by&#13;
transfers from the state budget). Municipalities administer these benefits, as well as any&#13;
other special benefits provided at municipality discretion (such as emergency food aid or&#13;
fuel) through their own local assistance offices. Responsibility for institutional care is&#13;
gradually being transferred to local governments as well, although the MSSL currently sets&#13;
standards and supervises these institutions.&#13;
1.8    Monitoring and evaluating the impact of social policy is a new role for the MSSL, as&#13;
under the Soviet period these tasks (to the extent they were done at all) were performed in&#13;
Moscow. The current system of monitoring and evaluation is: (i) largely based on the&#13;
monitoring of current survey data (which until recently was unrepresentative of the&#13;
population, especially of the emerging private sector and marginal groups), with some&#13;
analysis of administrative and budgetary data; (ii) largely based on intra-agency collection&#13;
and analysis of information, and less reliant on inter-agency collection and analysis; (iii)&#13;
largely based on irregular evaluations of information for policy purposes, and less reliant on&#13;
systematic and regular evaluation of information; and, (iv) largely based on short-term&#13;
forecasting, and less reliant on medium to long-term forecasting.&#13;
D. Issues&#13;
1.9    The capacity of the administration inherited from the pre-independence period and&#13;
charged with developing and implementing social policy is extremely weak. The MSSL&#13;
lacks the skills and knowledge to estimate the fiscal and social implications of proposed&#13;
social policy (such as the pension law, which is proving to be fiscally unsustainable). The&#13;
role of the MSSL with respect to the social assistance offices is also limited. At present, it&#13;
consists of conveying, interpreting, and clarifying formulae and regulations enshrined in&#13;
legislation, and there is little or no prompt or reliable information that the MSSL can use to&#13;
track policy. Analytical policy work appears to be mostly conducted in an ad hoc fashion,&#13;
with little attention devoted to long-term strategy. Difficult tradeoffs between policy options&#13;
are not assessed, leading to ineffective and costly policy choices such as the new pension&#13;
law.&#13;
1.10 The Social Indicators Division relies on its own policy analysis, as well as the&#13;
analytical work of other MSSL divisions. At present, key evaluation issues concerning social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
assistance are generally restricted to immediate budgetary priorities, and there is no regular&#13;
mechanism for evaluating a given policy once it is in place. The MSSL has insufficient&#13;
resources to: (i) identify a research program that would help the Government to establish&#13;
progress towards policy objectives; (ii) carry out that program, either on its own or in&#13;
cooperation with other agencies; and (iii) communicate evaluation results to the relevant&#13;
parties.&#13;
1.11  The above problems are compounded by a frequently inefficient and inflexible&#13;
organization for developing policy. Staff report spending 50 percent or more of their time&#13;
on non-core tasks, such as adjudication of benefit disputes at the local level. In part because&#13;
of its relatively recent emergence as an independent policy making institution, the MSSL has&#13;
been unable to formulate definitive strategic organizational goals, develop clear lines of&#13;
financial and managerial subordination, address critical gaps and overlaps in services&#13;
provided, utilize scarce physical and human resources efficiently, and establish the flexibility&#13;
to redeploy those resources and encourage teamwork between divisions.&#13;
1.12 Institutional placement continues to be the main service provided when problems&#13;
develop for children, families or the elderly because little community-based social assistance&#13;
is available. The need for assistance has risen since independence, as families cope with the&#13;
strains of the transition. Traditional models of service provision have been maintained, and&#13;
as a result there has been an increase of 34 percent in the number of children placed in&#13;
institutions between 1992 and 1994. The MSSL and the municipalities recognize the problem&#13;
and believe a reorientation is necessary, but are hampered by: (a) a lack of knowledge and&#13;
experience of appropriate alternatives; (b) a rapidly changing policy framework which has&#13;
resulted in some confusion regarding which levels of Government and which agencies are&#13;
responsible for these services; (c) fiscal constraints; and (d) a lack of understanding in&#13;
society about the needs of elderly, children, and disabled.&#13;
E. Government Reform Strategy&#13;
1.13 The Government is committed to continuing to improve the safety net, both in the&#13;
areas of policy design and implementation. During project preparation, the current policy&#13;
framework was reviewed by the MSSL and the Bank. A medium term policy agenda has&#13;
been prepared. Key items on the policy agenda for the medium term include:&#13;
a.    reformn of the public pension system to increase affordability and improve&#13;
incentives for labor supply;&#13;
b.    monitoring of the effectiveness of the social assistance system, with revisions&#13;
in benefit formulas as necessary to improve targeting; and&#13;
c.    reform of the policy framework for institutional care to provide incentives to&#13;
develop cheaper and better community-based alternatives.&#13;
The Government is also committed to undertaking the institutional changes needed to support&#13;
the realization of these policy goals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.14 To improve the effectiveness of the MSSL in safety net policy design, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, the Ministry has undertaken a review of the work organization and staff&#13;
functions. With assistance from consultants, core tasks have been identified, and new&#13;
approaches to performing these tasks efficiently were explored during a seminar on strategic&#13;
management in August, 1995. These new approaches, which involve clarifying&#13;
responsibilities in the Ministry and formalizing relationships with service delivery agencies,&#13;
will be applied during the project period through the development and implementation of an&#13;
MSSL strategic plan. The plan will clarify agency functions, interrelationships and goals, set&#13;
organizational targets for improving service to MSSL clients, and develop a mechanism for&#13;
monitoring and evaluating MSSL performance. The result should be a more efficient,&#13;
effective, and flexible Ministry structure. Before negotiations, an acceptable outline of the&#13;
MSSL strategic plan approved by Ministry management was submitted to the Bank by the&#13;
Government (see Para. 6.1 (d), page 33).&#13;
1.15  To improve the information base for the design, monitoring, and evaluation of social&#13;
safety net policy, the Department of Statistics redesigned the household survey. Data from&#13;
the new survey was made available in mid-1996. The MSSL intends to use this data, as well&#13;
as an improved administrative information base to be developed under the project, to assess&#13;
better the social, economic and fiscal impacts of government policy. With the assistance of&#13;
consultants, the MSSL has identified a strategy for improving the quality of applied social&#13;
policy research, and will leverage its scarce resources for in-house analysis through increased&#13;
use of outside consultants selected through a competitive tendering process and funded&#13;
through a new Policy Evaluation Fund (PEF). Future legislation presented to Government&#13;
and the Seimas will incorporate the results of these analyses. Before negotiations, by-laws&#13;
for the Policy Evaluation Fund (PEF) acceptable to the Bank and a plan acceptable to the&#13;
Bank for implementing and funding the PEF were submitted by the Government (see Para.&#13;
6.1 (c), page 33).&#13;
1.16  The Government has adopted a new policy focus in the delivery of social assistance&#13;
and social care which includes a commitment to the family and the community as the primary&#13;
location for raising children and maintaining the elderly. This approach, in use in OECD&#13;
countries for over 30 years, has been shown to be more effective because individuals are&#13;
better off if they are assisted in the community. The cost of providing assistance is also less&#13;
when it is not residential. Implementing this commitment requires improving the&#13;
coordination between agencies and levels of government, as well as the development and&#13;
testing of new, non-institutional interventions.&#13;
1.17  The Government has already begun the process of developing new community-based&#13;
interventions. After extensive discussion in the Ministry and with municipal representatives,&#13;
the Government has decided to support the development of two types of community-based&#13;
services: (a) day schools for handicapped children, and (b) community multi-service centers.&#13;
With technical assistance financed by the Swedish Government and the PHRD Grant, outlines&#13;
of these two interventions were prepared. In the fall of 1995, municipalities were invited to&#13;
submit proposals to develop these programs on a pilot basis. Out of 16 proposals, the six&#13;
best were chosen by a panel of external and local experts. The municipalities have revised&#13;
their proposals based on further technical assistance. The implementation of the proposals&#13;
will be supported under the project. Mid-term and final evaluations of each pilot will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
undertaken with the goal of developing replicable models in other communities. The policy&#13;
framework governing institutional care is also being reviewed to increase flexibility and&#13;
encourage local governments to develop community-based approaches tailored to the needs of&#13;
their client base.&#13;
F. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.18  The Bank's assistance strategy for Lithuania recognizes the crucial need to re-orient&#13;
the social safety net through policy reform and institutional development. This project is part&#13;
of a wider Bank program to support the implementation of these goals. This project,&#13;
originally called the Social Safety Net Project, was developed in response to a Government&#13;
request for a broad social policy project. After appraisal, the Government reviewed the&#13;
project and requested that several components be postponed and reconsidered after the&#13;
November, 1995 election. The scope of this project was therefore reduced during&#13;
negotiations. The Bank is discussing the redesign of the remaining components with the&#13;
Government.&#13;
1.19  The institutional development activities supported by the Project will increase the&#13;
Government's options with respect to social policy reform. Bank support for project&#13;
activities will facilitate the ongoing policy dialogue on social safety net issues. Project&#13;
activities will also strengthen the Government's ability to monitor the social impact of the&#13;
transition and to develop measures to reduce this impact on vulnerable groups, thus&#13;
improving the chances that Lithuania's transition strategy supported by the Bank will be&#13;
implemented successfully.&#13;
1.20  This project supports the Government strategy to expand the role of the private sector&#13;
in social service delivery where appropriate. The project supports the development of a&#13;
system in the MSSL of competitive tendering for applied policy research contracts. While&#13;
the bulk of the contracts will probably go to researchers associated with government&#13;
universities and institutes, some could be awarded to private research firms, thus supporting&#13;
the development of this knowledge industry. In the pilot projects, it is envisaged that non-&#13;
governmental organizations may become subcontractors to provide some of the client&#13;
services.&#13;
1.21  Bank-supported project preparation activities have generated substantial donor interest&#13;
and participation. Each project component has attracted donor partnerships in the form of&#13;
commitments to finance or provide technical assistance. In total, approximately 39 percent&#13;
of project costs will be covered by donor financing. In component 1, the Dutch Govermnent&#13;
and UNDP are the partners. All technical assistance and training for component 2 will be&#13;
financed by the Swedish Government. Thus, the Bank has played a catalytic role in&#13;
attracting financing for project goals, while remaining the financier of last resort in project&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
2.1   The Social Policy and Community Social Services Development project will support&#13;
the Government of Lithuania in providing social security to the population at an affordable&#13;
cost through institutional development activities to improve: (i) the capacity to analyze social&#13;
policy at all stages; and (ii) community social care services. This will be achieved through&#13;
the institutional development of the MSSL. The proposed project would assist the&#13;
Government in the following areas:&#13;
a.    developing the capacity of the MSSL to design, implement, monitor and evaluate&#13;
social safety net policies;&#13;
b.   reducing institutionalization of groups at risk (the handicapped, the elderly, etc.)&#13;
through the development, testing and replication of new community-based social&#13;
service models; and&#13;
c.    developing MSSL project management capacity.&#13;
B. Main Project Features&#13;
2.2   The project will be implemented over five years by the Ministry of Social Security&#13;
and Labor and six municipalities. Total project costs are estimated at about US$12.83&#13;
million. It comprises three components as follows:&#13;
1.    Social Policy Development Component&#13;
A.   Improved Resource Use in the MSSL&#13;
B.   Policy Monitoring, Evaluation, and Implementation&#13;
2.    Community Social Service Pilots Component&#13;
A.   Community Multi-Service Centers&#13;
B.   Centers for Disabled Children&#13;
C.   Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
3.    Project Management Component&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
C. Description of Components&#13;
Component 1: Social Policy Development (US$2.60 million base cost, or 24 percent of&#13;
total base cost)&#13;
2.3   This component will support the development, implementation, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of the MSSL social policy agenda. It will improve the allocation of human and&#13;
financial resources within the Ministry through a strategic planning approach, so that scarce&#13;
organizational resources are used more effectively and priority policy development and&#13;
evaluation tasks appropriately addressed. The component will strengthen the Ministry's&#13;
capacity to develop workable social policy solutions for presentation to the MSSL's clients,&#13;
including Government, Parliament, and the municipalities, and to improve municipal&#13;
administration of cash social assistance. It will also strengthen local capacity to prepare high&#13;
quality social policy analyses through training for users of household survey data (such as&#13;
universities and institutes). Component indicators for monitoring and evaluation progress&#13;
towards objectives are outlined in Annex A (page 35).&#13;
Subcomponent A: Improved Resource Use in the MSSL (US$0.95 million base cost)&#13;
2.4   This subcomponent will improve the resource allocation within the MSSL through&#13;
implementation of a strategic planning approach to Ministry relationships with service&#13;
delivery agencies, including local governments. It will help the MSSL to implement and&#13;
evaluate a program to improve the effectiveness of the organization with respect to core&#13;
policy development tasks, to institute an improved human resource policy, and to improve&#13;
the monitoring of MSSL program performance.&#13;
a.    Strategic Plan for Social Policy Development. The efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness of the MSSL in developing social policy will be supported&#13;
through implementation of a strategic plan, including a mission statement,&#13;
corporate objectives, clear lines of financial and managerial subordination,&#13;
quantifiable program targets at all levels, agreed indicators of performance,&#13;
and a mechanism for periodic re-evaluation of objectives and targets.&#13;
Implementation of the plan will be supported through technical assistance to:&#13;
(a) facilitate reorganization associated with the plan; (b) improve inter-agency&#13;
and intra-agency linkages, particularly oversight and linkages with the&#13;
municipalities, including a feasibility study for administering cash social&#13;
assistance through a central agency; (c) improve client service, to include&#13;
support for an annual survey of municipal social service office clients; and (d)&#13;
develop monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for tracking agency&#13;
performance.&#13;
b.    Improved Human Resources Policy. The second set of activities under this&#13;
subcomponent will support implementation of a management and&#13;
administration training program (local training, fellowships, study tours,&#13;
workshops) to provide staff with necessary skills in areas such as public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
administration and strategic management, budgeting, and use of hardware and&#13;
software. It will also support development of a Ministry personnel unit, which&#13;
will provide basic human resources services to management and staff.&#13;
2.5   Under this subcomponent, the project will finance technical assistance, fellowships&#13;
and training, and goods and furniture.&#13;
Subcomponent B: Policy Monitoring, Evaluation and Implementation (US$1.65&#13;
million base cost)&#13;
2.6   This subcomponent will strengthen the MSSL's capacity to assess social policies in&#13;
light of their social and fiscal impacts, and to prepare viable policy options for presentation&#13;
to other agencies and the broader public. It will assist the MSSL to improve the&#13;
management and analysis of survey and administrative data, and to produce and disseminate&#13;
regular reports on the impact of Government programs on the poor and vulnerable. It will&#13;
also strengthen local capacity to undertake social policy analysis through training of users of&#13;
the new household survey, and by supporting competitive contracting of social policy studies.&#13;
a.    Preparation of an Annual Social Report. The activities under this&#13;
subcomponent will support preparation and publication of an annual Social&#13;
Report. The Social Report will serve as a forum for decision-makers and&#13;
independent experts in social policy to review the situation of the poor and&#13;
vulnerable in Lithuania, to set priority areas to be addressed through social&#13;
policy, and to develop an appropriate action plan. Technical assistance and&#13;
training (including seminars and workshops on social policy issues) will be&#13;
provided to assist the MSSL to prepare and present the report.&#13;
b.    Applied Training Program. The second set of activities under this&#13;
subcomponent will support the establishment of a training program (seminars&#13;
and workshops, fellowships, and local and foreign training) to provide MSSL&#13;
staff and users of the household survey data with the skills necessary for&#13;
effective social policy monitoring and evaluation. Technical assistance and&#13;
training will be provided to develop skills in the areas of micro and macro&#13;
economics (especially human resources economics), actuarial/modeling&#13;
techniques, using household surveys for policy analysis, and related areas.&#13;
c.    Policy Evaluation Fund. The third set of activities under this subcomponent&#13;
will support the activities of the MSSL Policy Evaluation Fund (PEF), which&#13;
will strengthen local research capacity and improve the quality and relevance&#13;
of social policy analysis. The PEF will commission, select, review, and&#13;
disseminate studies on the implementation of the social policy agenda,&#13;
introducing a competitive tendering procedure for research contracts. The&#13;
project will help finance consultant services (local and foreign) identified by&#13;
the PEF board, including joint proposals by local and foreign researchers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
2.7   Under this subcomponent, the project will finance technical assistance, fellowships&#13;
and training, and equipment and materials.&#13;
Component 2: Community Social Service Pilot Projects (US$7.08 million base cost,&#13;
or 66 percent of total base costs)&#13;
2.8   This component will develop a feasible, cost-effective approach to social service&#13;
delivery that is community based and responsive to local needs. This approach should result&#13;
in fewer individuals being placed in institutional care, and better coordination of the delivery&#13;
of cash and non-cash benefits to clients by linking all social assistance offices and non-&#13;
governmental service providers in the community. It was designed in part on the basis of a&#13;
competitive tendering process with the municipalities (see para. 5.2, page 30). Component&#13;
indicators for monitoring and evaluation progress towards objectives are outlined in Annex A&#13;
(page 36).&#13;
Subcomponent A: Multi-Service Centers for The Elderly, Families with Children, and&#13;
the Disabled (US$4.02 million base cost).&#13;
2.9   This subcomponent will support the implementation of three pilot Multi-Service&#13;
Centers in Vilnius (the capital, pop. 590,100), Siauliai (pop. 147,800), and Svencionys (pop.&#13;
36,000), serving the elderly, families with children, and the disabled. The goal of the&#13;
subcomponent is to provide services to more than 1600 individuals a year that will help&#13;
prevent the institutionalization of more than 1100 of those individuals. The multi-service&#13;
centers differ in design because of varying local needs and existing resources. Different&#13;
projects will assist these groups of vulnerable individuals in the following ways:&#13;
Vilnius:    The Social Service Center in Vilnius will serve four vulnerable groups at risk&#13;
of institutional placement or homelessness: mentally handicapped young adults,&#13;
the elderly, mothers and their children who have been physically abused, and&#13;
alcoholics and drug abusers. The activities of the Social Service Center will&#13;
be coordinated by a screening office where staff will identify individuals'&#13;
problems and the most appropriate assistance for them. The four service&#13;
components are:&#13;
1. Training Center for Handicapped Young Adults. This program&#13;
will be located in underutilized space in a special school for mentally&#13;
handicapped children. Fifty four youth will be trained in carpentry,&#13;
sewing and taught other job skills. Relations will be established with the&#13;
Labor Exchange which will work to find jobs for these youth so that they&#13;
may lead financially and socially independent lives.&#13;
2. Day Center for the Elderly and Handicapped. This center will&#13;
provide a place for the elderly and the handicapped to have social&#13;
contact, participate in cultural activities and receive needed social&#13;
services. These types of social supports have been shown to prevent&#13;
institutionalization and deterioration of the elderly. In addition, twenty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
two social workers will visit the frail elderly in their homes to prepare&#13;
their meals, provide housekeeping services and transport them to medical&#13;
and other needed services.&#13;
3. Shelter for Battered Mothers and Their Children. A former&#13;
nursery will be used as a temporary residence for approximately 40&#13;
mothers and their children who have been physically abused. Young,&#13;
single mothers without families who have been discharged from a&#13;
children's institution will also be able to use this as a temporary&#13;
residence. The project will provide social services to help these mothers&#13;
through their crisis and help them to find permanent and safe living&#13;
accommodations. Absent such a program, the young children might have&#13;
no place to live other than an institution after their families break up.&#13;
The mothers are at risk of homelessness.&#13;
4. Rehabilitation Center for Alcoholics and Drug Abusers. A day&#13;
center will be established for recovering alcoholics and drug abusers to&#13;
meet, and to receive counselling and social services. The program will&#13;
help keep families together so that children have a safe place in the&#13;
community.&#13;
Svencionys: Svencionys is a poor rural area in the west/east of Lithuania with many&#13;
vulnerable groups. One third of the population are pensioners, one hundred&#13;
now receive care, and 1,000 should receive care. Without care in their&#13;
homes, many will be placed in an institution. Svencionys will create a Social&#13;
Service Center with several components in different locations that will be part&#13;
of a network of services. The components are:&#13;
1. Reception Center. This Center would assess the needs of individuals&#13;
for services and refer them to the most appropriate program. The Center&#13;
would also coordinate the network of social service programs including&#13;
non-governmental organizations. This coordination will improve and&#13;
rationalize the delivery of services.&#13;
2. Social Rehabilitation Center for the Handicapped. This center will&#13;
be opened for children in the former nursery school "Gandriukas." This&#13;
center will provide education and training to help children learn to live&#13;
independently. It will also provide support to their parents so that their&#13;
children can live with them more easily.&#13;
3. Home Delivery of Services for the Elderly. This program will have&#13;
social workers visit the homes of 500 elderly, bring and prepare meals,&#13;
provide personal care and housekeeping services, and bring the elderly to&#13;
medical and other appointments, allowing them to live safely in the&#13;
community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
4. Program for Former Prisoners. Individuals who have returned&#13;
from prison have caused serious problems in Svencionys. This program&#13;
will provide a short-term residence, services and assistance to former&#13;
prisoners. Without this assistance, former prisoners returning to&#13;
Svencionys are more likely to commit new crimes and return to prison.&#13;
5. Temporary Residence for Children. A short-term residence will be&#13;
created for children who need a temporary place to live until a crisis in&#13;
their family is resolved or until a more permanent, long-term community-&#13;
based solution can be found such as living with a relative or foster care.&#13;
Social assistance will also be provided to the families of these children to&#13;
enable them to return home safely, thus avoiding the more costly and&#13;
harmful long term placement.&#13;
Siauliai:    The municipality of Siauliai has developed the beginnings of a social services&#13;
network to serve some of the individuals living in vulnerable situations, but&#13;
many individuals who are at risk of being institutionalized are not receiving the&#13;
assistance they need. The services that are provided are fragmented. There&#13;
are 860 invalids living alone, 530 pensioners over 70 years old living alone&#13;
(some of whom are at risk), 240 families in which both spouses are invalids,&#13;
and 2,160 families with children with income lower than the minimum living&#13;
level. The Social Services Center that will be created in the former Soviet&#13;
Army barracks will be both the coordinating center for social services for&#13;
Siauliai and a Day Employment Center and social service center for mentally&#13;
handicapped adults.&#13;
1. Coordinating Center for Social Services. The center will organize&#13;
different activities for almost 600 people. It will coordinate a network of&#13;
services including those provided by non-governmental organizations.&#13;
This coordination will improve and rationalize the delivery of services.&#13;
Twenty social work staff will provide home care to the elderly and the&#13;
handicapped, allowing them to have enough support to remain safely in&#13;
their homes. The Center will also become a training center for social&#13;
workers throughout the city to increase the number of individuals who&#13;
can work to prevent institutional placement.&#13;
2. Day Employment Center for the Handicapped. Handicapped&#13;
individuals at the Center will learn job skills and be assisted in finding&#13;
work. They will also learn housekeeping skills and other skills to live&#13;
independent lives and avoid institutional placement. Many of these&#13;
individuals live isolated from society; the Day Center will provide the&#13;
opportunity to socialize with others. A van will pick up individuals who&#13;
have difficulty walking, take them to the Day Center and return them&#13;
home at night.&#13;
2.10  Under this subcomponent, the project will finance technical assistance, staff training,&#13;
renovation of buildings, furniture, and special equipment for the centers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Subcomponent B: Education Centers for Disabled Children (US$1.85 million base&#13;
cost).&#13;
2.11  The subcomponent will support the implementation of three Education Centers for&#13;
Disabled Children in Anyksciai (pop. 38,400), Moletai (pop. 27,100) and Utena (pop.&#13;
54,000). The goal of the subcomponent is to prevent over 70 handicapped children from&#13;
being placed an institution, by developing services in the community at a lower cost than&#13;
institutional placement. These children currently reside in their own homes, receive no&#13;
education or training, and have very little social contact. They are at risk of being placed in&#13;
an institution because of the strain on their parents. As they currently receive no training to&#13;
live independently, when their parents are no longer available as educators, the children will&#13;
be forced to reside in an institution. The Centers will prevent the institutionalization of these&#13;
children by educating them, teaching them to live independent lives, and providing support&#13;
and assistance to their families.&#13;
Anyksciai:   Sixty-four mentally handicapped children under the age of 20 live with their&#13;
families in the Anyksciai district. Forty-three of these children are socially&#13;
isolated and do not attend any school or activity. Unless assistance is provided&#13;
many of these children may be placed in institutions for the handicapped.&#13;
Anyksciai has established a small day center educating 15 handicapped&#13;
children. It will expand the existing center to serve an additional 25 children.&#13;
The program will add a job training and job placement program to help them&#13;
to develop skills to live financially and socially independent lives. The&#13;
component activities will enhance the training of the existing staff as well as&#13;
the staff for the expanded program. A special bus will pick up the children&#13;
every day at their homes and return them home at night. Parents will also&#13;
participate in the program at the center.&#13;
Moletai:     Forty mentally handicapped children under the age of 20 live with their&#13;
families in the rural area surrounding Moletai. They are socially isolated and&#13;
their parents live under great strain. Unless assistance is provided, many of&#13;
these children may be placed in institutions for the handicapped. Moletai will&#13;
establish a center to educate 24 of these children, train them to live&#13;
independently, provide basic job skills, and help them to gain self-confidence.&#13;
The center will work with the parents in their homes and in the center to teach&#13;
them how to improve the care provided to their children, and to reduce the&#13;
strain on them. A special van for the handicapped will be used to take these&#13;
children from their homes every day, bring them to the center and return them&#13;
home at night.&#13;
Utena:       Twenty two children in the Utena region live with their families but do not&#13;
attend school, and have little (if any) social contact outside of their immediate&#13;
family. The center will educate these children and train them to be able to&#13;
live in society independently. The center is being established in close&#13;
cooperation with the Utena Medical College, which is training occupational&#13;
therapists, nursing specialists and social workers who will have field&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
placements in the center during their studies and be employed by the center&#13;
upon graduation.&#13;
2.12  Under this subcomponent, the project will finance consultant services, staff training,&#13;
renovation of buildings, furniture, and special equipment for the centers.&#13;
Subcomponent C: Monitoring and Evaluation (US$1.22 million base cost)&#13;
2.13  The subcomponent will support the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation&#13;
of the three Multi-Service Centers and the three Education Centers for Disabled Children.&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation will include the following activities: (i) a baseline study of social&#13;
service needs and services available; (ii) an analysis of funding of institutions and community&#13;
services that could recommend ways of redirecting funding to community-based services; (iii)&#13;
establishment of a computerized case monitoring system and bi-annual site reports; (iv)&#13;
annual conferences to review the pilot projects; (v) a mid-term evaluation to ensure that the&#13;
pilots are on schedule, and to provide a preliminary assessment of services; and (vi) a final&#13;
evaluation including the plan for replication. These activities will be used to determine if the&#13;
pilot projects are improving the quality of services provided, cost effective and replicable&#13;
alternatives to institutional placement for the various groups of clients served.&#13;
2.14  Under this subcomponent, the project will finance consultant services, training of&#13;
staff, and the cost of renovating and equipping facilities, equipment for the disabled and&#13;
vehicles for transporting the disabled and visiting the elderly.&#13;
Component 3: Project Management (US$1.02 million base cost)&#13;
2.15 This component will support the management of the implementation of project&#13;
activities through the development of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The project will&#13;
finance local consulting services, technical assistance and training in procurement, and&#13;
required PCU equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
A. Project Cost Estimates&#13;
3.1   Total project costs, net of taxes and duties, are estimated at about US$12.31 million,&#13;
including physical and price contingencies of US$1.61 million. The project will finance civil&#13;
works, furniture, equipment and materials, vehicles, technical assistance, computer hardware&#13;
and software, and local and foreign training.&#13;
3.2   All local cost estimates are based on comparative unit prices currently prevailing in&#13;
Lithuania, while all foreign costs for machinery and equipment are based on prices prevailing&#13;
in the United States as well as other international sources. Base costs of all components&#13;
were calculated at 1996 prices, and under the assumption of a fixed exchange rate of 4&#13;
Litai/US$1.00 (February, 1996). Foreign costs also include provisions for shipment and&#13;
insurance to Lithuania. Tables 3.1 and 3.2 below summarize the estimated costs by&#13;
component and expenditure category, respectively. A detailed project cost and financing&#13;
summary table is provided in Annex D (see page 39).&#13;

3.3    Recurrent Costs. Recurrent costs, estimated at US$3.93 million, are the incremental&#13;
operating costs generated by project investments. All local recurrent costs are financed&#13;
entirely by the state and the six participating municipalities in which community-based&#13;
service projects will be located. These recurrent costs arise from: (i) administrative and&#13;
operating activities associated with the PCU; (ii) operating and maintenance activities of the&#13;
Community Multi-Service and Disabled Children Centers; (iii) operating costs of equipment&#13;
(electricity and other); (iv) repair and maintenance of equipment (computer equipment,&#13;
special equipment and appliances); (v) supplies (for computer equipment, office equipment,&#13;
equipment for disabled, and other); (vi) repair and maintenance of vehicles; (vii) staff&#13;
salaries for MSSL and Multi-Service and Disabled Children Centers; (viii) meal service&#13;
programs for the Multi-Service and Disabled Children Centers; (ix) annual project audits;&#13;
and (x) other costs associated with conferences. These recurrent costs will be monitored&#13;
through the disbursement tracking system and examined closely during annual reviews.&#13;
B. Financing Arrangements&#13;
3.4    The proposed Bank Loan of US$3.70 million equivalent would finance about 30&#13;
percent of total project costs, including contingencies (see Table 3.3 and Annex D). The&#13;
Bank would finance 27.9 percent of foreign costs and 31.7 percent of local costs. The Bank&#13;
will not finance any recurrent costs, which will be financed by the state, municipalities and&#13;
donors.&#13;
3.5    Counterpart Funding. Lithuania's counterpart contribution is estimated at US$4.32&#13;
million (representing 35 percent of total project cost). The breakdown is as follows: The&#13;
Government of Lithuania will provide US$0.67 million, or about 5 percent of total project&#13;
costs, and the participating Municipalities will contribute US$3.65 million, or about 30&#13;
percent of total project costs.&#13;
3.6    Co-Financing Arrangements. Parallel co-financing for project technical assistance&#13;
and training activities on a grant basis, of about US$4.29 million has been confirmed. The&#13;
Government of Sweden has given preliminary confirmation of about US$3.44 million for&#13;
technical assistance activities under Component 2, and the Government of Netherlands has&#13;
confirmed an amount of US$0.85 million equivalent for Component 1. During Negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that in the event that proposed grant financing does not materialize,&#13;
the Government of Lithuania would find alternative financing (para. 6.2 (c), page 33).&#13;
3.7    Implementation Agreements. The MOF will provide direct grant assistance to the&#13;
participating municipalities to assist in the implementation of the proposed Community Multi-&#13;
Service and Disabled Children Centers. An Implementation Agreement has been entered into&#13;
between the MOF and each Municipality (para. 6.1(e), page 33). The respective&#13;
implementation responsibilities of the MSSL and the Ministry of Finance concerning&#13;
expenditure management and reporting requirements have also been agreed. As a condition&#13;
of loan effectiveness, a Project Implementation Agreement will have been executed on behalf&#13;
of the Ministry of Finance and MSSL on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank for the&#13;
purposes of the Project (para. 6.3 (e), page 34).&#13;

C. Procurement&#13;
3.8    Since Lithuania does not have a long tradition of competitive bidding for&#13;
procurement of public goods and services, a Country Procurement Assessment Report&#13;
(CPAR) is not required at this stage. A "Country Procurement Note" (CPN) dated May,&#13;
1995, containing information about bidding opportunities (for procurement on the basis of&#13;
International Competitive Bidding) was prepared, which established that the Government has&#13;
started to introduce forms of competitive bidding. The Government has adopted legislation&#13;
instituting public procurement regulations as part of its comprehensive program to transform&#13;
its centrally planned economy to a market-oriented system based on the development of a&#13;
competitive private sector. However, the progress in developing and implementing national&#13;
procurement regulations with associated monitoring system has been slow to date. The&#13;
Borrower will follow the Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits" (January, 1995, revised January and August, 1996). Similarly, all Consulting&#13;
Services will be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for "Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as an Executing Agency" (August, 1981).&#13;
Since legislation regulating national procurement procedures might take some time, the&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procurement under the project will follow the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines and the Regional Bidding documents for the Procurement of Works through NCB&#13;
(less than US$250,000), issued by the Region on August, 1995. For individual or other&#13;
small consulting contracts, sample Bank documents will be used. Procurement arrangements&#13;
are summarized in Table 3.4.&#13;
3.9     All procurement methods are described in the Operational Manual, which are&#13;
consistent with Bank Guidelines. The detailed procurement plan relating to the nature and&#13;
size of the packaging, procurement methods and the schedule of the procurement activities&#13;
are in Annex B. The General Procurement Notice (GPN) was initially published in&#13;
Development Business, No. 429, December 31, 1995, and was updated on November 30,&#13;
1996 (Issue No. 451). The GPN shall be updated annually for all outstanding procurement.&#13;
3.10   A technical assistance and training plan for developing the capacity of the PCU to&#13;
manage the project, including procurement arrangements, is undergoing implementation.&#13;
The efficiency and capability of the Borrower to carry out the Bank's procurement&#13;
procedures will be strengthened further through ongoing training and the use of standard&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
bidding documents. In addition, provision of foreign technical assistance for the PCU should&#13;
ensure adequate administration of procurement. The Bank will conduct a Project Launch&#13;
Workshop in the first half of 1997 to include training sessions on procurement for the staff of&#13;
the PCU. Procurement activities will also be monitored regularly through Bank supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;

3.11   Management of Procurement. The PCU will carry out procurement of all goods&#13;
and services and for civil works for the project using Standard Bidding Documents and&#13;
evaluation guidelines. The PCU will manage and keep records of all procurement operations&#13;
and ensure compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement. The PCU&#13;
will closely coordinate with component and sub-component coordinators on procurement&#13;
related matters. The technical specifications, terms of reference, evaluation methodologies&#13;
and reports for procurement operations under the project will be prepared jointly between the&#13;
component and sub-component coordinators and the PCU. The PCU will also be responsible&#13;
to ensure that all major procurement steps are carried out in accordance with the Bank&#13;
guidelines and procedures. The PCU will maintain a procurement registry of all&#13;
procurement operations under the project to be submitted as part of the semi-annual progress&#13;
reports.&#13;
3.12   Co-financing would be carried out in parallel, and thus procurement for non-Bank&#13;
financed sub-components would be carried out in accordance with procurement regulations of&#13;
the respective financier. The PCU would carry out the Bank financed procurement.&#13;
3.13   Procurement of Civil Works (US$0.96 million). The project will support&#13;
rehabilitation of existing facilities under Community Social Service Pilot Projects (component&#13;
2 of the project). Contracts valued less than US$250,000 equivalent would be procured&#13;
using NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank, nationally advertised to ensure adequate&#13;
competition. The project has given consideration to Lithuania's competitive and highly&#13;
skilled construction sector. Moreover, the type of construction works envisaged under the&#13;
project are minor rehabilitation in different parts of the country, consisting mainly of&#13;
upgrading existing structures that are well within the capacity of domestic industry and are&#13;
unlikely to be attractive to foreign firms. International bidders shall be allowed to participate&#13;
in the bids in accordance with the World Bank Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
3.14   Community Social Services Pilot Component. The project will finance the&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading of Community Multi-Service and Disabled Children Centers&#13;
under this component. Three contracts, with an aggregate amount of $687,000 to upgrade&#13;
existing multi-service centers, and another three contracts with an aggregate amount of&#13;
$175,000 to rehabilitate education centers for disabled children in the project municipalities,&#13;
are expected.&#13;
3.15    A preliminary civil works plan outlining all civil works operations, including an&#13;
implementation schedule of critical activities, has been already prepared. Since all civil&#13;
works are for rehabilitation, no land acquisition will be needed. Clear title to land and&#13;
building or a suitable long-term lease will be required prior to proceeding with civil works&#13;
operations envisaged under the project.&#13;
3.16   Procurement of Goods (US$1.04 million). The project will finance computer&#13;
equipment, special equipment for handicapped and elderly, office equipment, appliances and&#13;
supplies, furniture and other supplies, and vehicles for the Ministry of Social Security and&#13;
Labor, and the Multi-Service and Disabled Children Centers. Equipment plans have already&#13;
been prepared by the Government. Smaller contracts of up to $250,000 equivalent, such as&#13;
for computer equipment ($0.07 million); special equipment for handicapped and elderly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
($0.22 million); office equipment ($0.07 million); facility appliances and supplies ($0. 11&#13;
million), furniture and other supplies ($0.20 million) and vehicles ($0.29 million) would be&#13;
procured through International Shopping procedures based on comparison of price quotations&#13;
obtained from at least three suppliers from two eligible countries . Since contracts for&#13;
furniture and supplies for various municipal community service centers would be required at&#13;
different times and in numerous small off-the-shelf packages, it is most expedient to follow&#13;
National Shopping procedures. Therefore, contracts for furniture and other supplies costing&#13;
less than US$30,000 equivalent would be procured through comparison of at least three price&#13;
quotations.&#13;
3.17    Procurement of Consulting Services (US$ 4.24 million) and Training (US$ 2.14&#13;
million). A strategy for hiring consultants would be submitted to the Bank for review and&#13;
approval as part of the annual Action Plan before consultants are hired. Consulting and&#13;
training services would be procured on a competitive selection basis following the World&#13;
Bank's guidelines and procedures (see para 3.8, page 18). Consulting services will be&#13;
required in the areas of: strategic management and facilitation; strategic management in&#13;
social assistance; social assistance benefit management and administration; rehabilitation of&#13;
disabled children and adults; rehabilitation of prisoners; project benefits monitoring and&#13;
evaluation; social policy reforms; and project management and implementation. It is&#13;
envisaged that there will be approximately ten separate contracts financed by the Bank (see&#13;
Annex B, page 37). All such consulting contracts will be awarded on a competitive selection&#13;
basis.&#13;
3.18    Prior Review. All procurement packages above US$200,000, and the first two civil&#13;
works contracts, would be subject to the Bank's prior review and approval. For consulting&#13;
services, prior review is required for all contracts with individuals exceeding $50,000, all&#13;
contracts with consulting firms exceeding US$100,000, and terms of references for all&#13;
consulting services irrespective of the contract value. Other procurement would be subject to&#13;
the Bank's post review during supervision of the project, in accordance with the procurement&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
D. Disbursement&#13;
3.19   The proposed Bank loan of US$3.70 million equivalent would be disbursed over a&#13;
period of five years with an estimated completion date of April, 2001. Disbursements&#13;
would be made against the categories of expenditures as indicated in Table 3.5.&#13;
3.20   Disbursement requests will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by the PCU with&#13;
the required supporting documentation. It is expected that administrative staff from the PCU&#13;
would participate in disbursement training organized by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

($ Million)&#13;
Category                Amount (US$      % of Expenditure to be&#13;

1. Civil Works                            0.96      100% of foreign expenditures&#13;
and 82% of local expenditures&#13;
2. Equipment, Vehicles and Supplies       1.04       100% of foreign expenditures,&#13;
100% of local expenditures&#13;
(ex-factory cost) and 80% of&#13;
local expenditures for other&#13;
items procured locally&#13;
3. Consulting and Training Services       1.70       100%&#13;
Total                            j     3.70&#13;
3.21   Retroactive Financing. Up to US$350,000 would be financed retroactively for&#13;
eligible expenditures. Retroactive financing is justified since critical project activities are&#13;
already underway, all of which are eligible for financing under the proposed project. All&#13;
Community pilots (Multi-Service and Disabled Children Centers) have been identified. A&#13;
Strategic Plan for MSSL to improve work organization is close to completion. By-laws and&#13;
procedures for the Policy Evaluation Fund in the MSSL have also been established. Lastly,&#13;
a draft Operational Manual has been prepared by the Borrower and was reviewed by the&#13;
Bank. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the maximum amount, nature of items&#13;
that will be eligible for retroactive financing, and the effective date for retroactive financing&#13;
(para. 6.2 (d), page 33).&#13;
3.22   Documentation of Expenditures. Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) would be used&#13;
for reimbursement of less than US$200,000 for civil works and goods. Consultant contracts&#13;
of US$100,000 equivalent or less for firms, and US$50,000 equivalent for individuals would&#13;
also be made on the basis of SOEs. Contracts below these thresholds would be made on the&#13;
basis of SOE, for which supporting documentation would be consolidated and maintained in&#13;
the PCU and would be made available for the required audit as well as to Bank supervision&#13;
missions. Applications for direct payment and special commitment may be submitted&#13;
provided they are for amounts equivalent to at least US$70,000. The Bank would not honor&#13;
direct payments below US$70,000.&#13;
3.23   Special Account. To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would&#13;
establish a Special Account in a major foreign commercial bank on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank to cover the Bank's share of eligible expenditures. The authorized&#13;
allocation would be US$350,000. At the request of the Borrower, and based on project&#13;
needs, the Bank would make an initial deposit into the Special Account up to the authorized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
allocation. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted&#13;
monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier.&#13;
Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedure.&#13;
Monthly bank statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower&#13;
would accompany all replenishment requests.&#13;
3.24   Project Preparation Facility. The Government has requested a Project Preparation&#13;
Facility (PPF) advance to complete the preparation and design of the different project&#13;
components. The requested amount is approximately US$700,000 and is expected to be used&#13;
to finance technical assistance and a limited amount of computer equipment to test the&#13;
proposed management system. Any unutilized amount will be refunded before project&#13;
becomes effective.&#13;

E. Accounting and Audits&#13;
3.25   The PCU will maintain records for each project component, and consolidate them&#13;
into the project accounts and SOEs. Supporting documentation will be maintained by the&#13;
PCU and made available to Bank missions and independent auditors as required. The PCU&#13;
will maintain and prepare separate accounts of expenditures for each project component. It&#13;
would also prepare and provide the Bank semi-annual reports on implementation progress&#13;
along with a financial statement of project expenditures. The accounting records would show&#13;
expenditures by date, currency, financing source (World Bank, Government, or co-financier),&#13;
category of expenditure and project component and subcomponent. All project-related&#13;
accounts will be prepared in accordance with internationally accepted accounting procedures.&#13;
3.26   Project accounts, including the Special Account and SOEs, will be audited annually&#13;
in accordance with appropriate auditing principles applied by external private independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to the Bank, with terms of reference for auditors and reports approved by&#13;
the Bank. The costs of the consultant services to be employed for such annual audits will be&#13;
fully incurred by the Government. Audit reports will be furnished to the Bank within six&#13;
months of the end of the Government's fiscal year. It is recommended that the Government&#13;
retain the same auditors throughout the project life cycle, to review the accounting systems&#13;
and supporting internal procedures and practices for the project accounts and SOEs. This&#13;
would permit auditors to review the accounting records early on and make recommendations&#13;
for needed improvements. It would also permit auditors to perform interim audit work&#13;
during the year so that they can complete the audit on a timely basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
3.27   Financial accountability will be a fundamental tool for monitoring project&#13;
implementation and management. The PCU will be responsible for monitoring the project's&#13;
financial information, ensuring that all project expenditures and commitments are consistent&#13;
with the project's agreed allocations for expenditure categories. Such reliable and timely&#13;
financial information will be critical to good decision-making. The PCU will ensure that all&#13;
project objectives are successfully achieved. Good accounting practices will enable a review&#13;
of financial aspects of the project as against the achievements expected, thus providing a&#13;
vehicle for the comparison of planned versus actual performance. The development and&#13;
maintenance of a good financial information system will therefore be vital for effective&#13;
project management. As a condition of effectiveness, the Borrower will have in place a&#13;
project expenditure management system within MSSL acceptable to the Bank (para 6.3 (a),&#13;
page 34).&#13;
3.28   The Operational Manual will provide guidance on accounting and auditing to the&#13;
Government in the implementation of Bank assisted projects, drawing from information&#13;
provided in the Financial Accounting Reporting and Auditing Handbook (FARAH). The&#13;
objective will be to provide a reasonable level of understanding of the role of financial&#13;
management in overall project management and the importance of various elements,&#13;
including accounting system design, the linkage of financial information to key indicators of&#13;
project objectives and financial reporting, and audits. The Operational Manual will also&#13;
provide template formats for financial statements, standard forms for audit documentation,&#13;
and sample generic terms of reference for audits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Organization and Management&#13;
4.1    The project was prepared by Lithuanian working groups from the Ministry of Social&#13;
Security and Labor, assisted by consultants financed through the project PHRD fund.&#13;
Government commitment and ownership of project objectives, activities, and outputs was&#13;
strengthened through two project preparation workshops facilitated by the German technical&#13;
assistance agency GTZ, using the participatory planning approach 'ZOPP.' During those&#13;
workshops, the participants confirmed the importance a strong Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU) will play during implementation.&#13;
4.2    The PCU will consist of the project director, an accountant, a part-time social policy&#13;
training coordinator, a part-time strategic planning coordinator, an implementation&#13;
coordinator for the Community Social Services Pilots Component, a procurement/civil works&#13;
specialist, a training and evaluation specialist, and an interpreter/project secretary (all local&#13;
staff). The PCU will receive policy guidance and act as the secretariat of the project&#13;
Steering Committee of the MSSL, chaired by the Minister and including representatives from&#13;
the senior management of the Ministry. An external advisor in project management will be&#13;
employed to complement local staff as long as necessary throughout the project. Funds are&#13;
allocated in the project for other external technical assistance which may be required (e.g.,&#13;
with the preparation of the mid-term evaluation). An Operational Manual describing the&#13;
organization of the PCU, its functions, and responsibilities, and the linkages between the&#13;
different entities, as well as report formats and administrative steps to be followed in&#13;
implementing and monitoring the project will be prepared by the PCU. Before Negotiations,&#13;
the Government provided the Bank with a draft of the Operational Manual (para. 6.1 (b),&#13;
page 33). As a condition of loan effectiveness, a final Operational Manual satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank for the purposes of the Project will have been adopted (para. 6.3 (d), page 34).&#13;
4.3    The PCU, reporting to the Steering Committee, will be responsible for the timely&#13;
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of project activities. The PCU will ensure&#13;
effective administration of critical project activities. Specific tasks of the PCU will include:&#13;
(a) coordinate implementation of various activities and ensure that all resources&#13;
utilized under the project are in accordance with priorities and objectives&#13;
defined;&#13;
(b) monitor and report to the Steering Committee and to the Bank on the progress&#13;
toward achievement of the project objectives and the agreed policy measures;&#13;
(c) monitor and evaluate systematically activities agreed to in implementation plans&#13;
by making periodic assessment of the relevance, performance and impact of&#13;
these activities, ensuring that project objectives are achieved;&#13;
(d) monitor availability of counterpart funds when required for the project;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
(e) manage and keep records of all procurement operations ensuring compliance&#13;
with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement;&#13;
(f) maintain a procurement registry of all procurement operations under the project;&#13;
(g) maintain records for each project component, and consolidate them into project&#13;
accounts and SOEs;&#13;
(h) monitor the project's financial information ensuring that all project expenditures&#13;
and commitments are consistent with the project's agreed allocations for&#13;
expenditure categories;&#13;
(i) manage contracting of technical assistance services and monitor the placement&#13;
and performance of staff receiving training, as well as the consultants hired&#13;
under the project;&#13;
(j) prepare and distribute consolidated periodic reports to the relevant government&#13;
authorities and to the Bank reflecting: (a) the status of implementation process,&#13;
problems encountered and corrective actions needed, and (b) current costs of&#13;
each project component and estimated costs of completion;&#13;
(k) ensure the timely preparation and submission to relevant government authorities&#13;
and the Bank of annual audit reports of project expenditures (including SOEs)&#13;
and accounts;&#13;
(I) monitor compliance with legal covenants; and&#13;
(m) prepare and complete relevant sections of the Implementation Completion&#13;
Report (ICR) at the close of the Project.&#13;
4.4    Specific project coordination responsibilities are as follows:&#13;
*  The project director will report to the Minister. The director will be responsible&#13;
for managing the PCU, and maintaining clear and open communication with all&#13;
project stakeholders -- the component coordinators, the Steering Committee, the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, other ministries and parts of Government, beneficiaries,&#13;
other donors, etc.&#13;
*  The accountant will be responsible for monitoring the projects's financial&#13;
transactions covering budgeting and accounting, disbursements, audit, and all&#13;
procurement contracts.&#13;
*  The training and evaluation specialist will oversee implementation of the&#13;
training, monitoring and evaluating plan for the pilots.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
* The civil works/procurement specialist (with the support of an external advisor)&#13;
will oversee all procurement activities, ensuring the standard bidding documents&#13;
are used and the Bank's procedures are fully complied with, and oversee the&#13;
implementation of the civil works plan for the pilots (ensuring that all civil&#13;
works are performed at or above agreed quality standards and in accordance&#13;
with agreed architectural specifications, timetables and budgets). This individual&#13;
will also be responsible for maintaining all procurement records, and contribute&#13;
to the annual, mid-term, and final reviews for the project.&#13;
*  The PCU component coordinators will be responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
management of each subcomponent, and will oversee implementation,&#13;
monitoring, and evaluation activities by the component working groups, local&#13;
and foreign consultants, and those undertaking civil works and other component&#13;
activities, and also contribute to annual, mid-term, and final project reviews.&#13;
*  A pilot coordinator in each municipality will be responsible for all aspects of&#13;
pilot implementation at the local level, working directly under the supervision of&#13;
the PCU component coordinator and with the PCU civil works/procurement&#13;
specialist. The coordinator will report to the PCU director on a monthly basis.&#13;
A management consultant has been retained under the project and is currently&#13;
working with the counterparts to set up central/local project management&#13;
procedures.&#13;
4.5    The Project Management Plan (PMP) (included in the Operational Manual) will&#13;
describe the organization of the PCU, its functions and responsibilities, and the linkages&#13;
between the different entities, as well as report formats and administrative steps to be&#13;
followed in implementing and monitoring the project. The PMP will be prepared by the&#13;
PCU. As a condition of loan effectiveness, the PCU will have been established within MSSL,&#13;
with functions and responsibilities acceptable to the Bank and a project director and key staff&#13;
whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference are acceptable to the Bank, have&#13;
been appointed (para. 6.3(b), page 34). Also as a condition of loan effectiveness, the&#13;
Borrower will have entered into arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the provision of&#13;
project management advice to the PCU para. 6.3 (c), page 34).&#13;
B. Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
4.6    The Steering Committee and the PCU will be responsible for monitoring project&#13;
implementation activities. The Implementation Plan (included in the Operational Manual)&#13;
includes for each component project performance indicators which will be used to track the&#13;
progress made (see Annex A, page 35). These indicators were developed by the project&#13;
working groups. The plan includes both process and outcome targets, covering: fiscal impact&#13;
(such as cost savings from de-institutionalization, improved use of resources within the&#13;
MSSL), beneficiary impact (i.e., improved client satisfaction with community pilots), quality&#13;
of service (i.e., improved economic analysis of policy options), and progress in planned&#13;
activities (i.e., programs implemented, strategic plans completed). During negotiations, the&#13;
Government confirmed agreement on the performance indicators (para 6.2(a), page 33).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
4.7    The PCU will ensure that all reporting requirements under the project are carried out&#13;
in accordance with the appropriate formats and with the agreed submission schedules. The&#13;
director will be responsible for ensuring that the monitoring of each component is carried out&#13;
and reported to project management and the Bank (in accordance with the monitoring plan&#13;
included in the Operational Manual). Semiannual project implementation reports will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank by June 30 and December 31 of each calendar year, with the latter&#13;
also including a draft Annual Action Plan for the upcoming calendar year for Bank approval.&#13;
The Government and the Bank will conduct joint reviews in an annual supervision mission on&#13;
the progress made in the implementation of the project of each year. During these reviews,&#13;
the Bank and the Government would agree upon proposed Action Plans incorporating the&#13;
results of the process evaluations. The approved Action Plans would determine the specific&#13;
activities eligible for financing under the project. Only those activities in the approved plans&#13;
would be eligible for project financing.&#13;
4.8   An Implementation Completion Report would be submitted to the Bank promptly after&#13;
the completion of the project, but in any event not later than six months after the Loan&#13;
Closing Date. Included in the ICR would be an assessment of: the execution and initial&#13;
operation of the project, its costs and benefits derived or to be derived, the performance of&#13;
the Borrower and the World Bank and other agencies involved on their respective obligations&#13;
and accomplishments, and lessons learned. Agreement was reached during negotiations on&#13;
the reporting requirements and formats (para 6.2(b), page 33).&#13;
C. Project Supervision&#13;
4.9    The proposed project would be supervised by Bank personnel from both headquarters&#13;
and the Vilnius office of the Regional Mission from the Baltic Countries. In view of the lack&#13;
of experience of the Borrower with Bank project implementation and procurement&#13;
procedures,, the project will require a considerable supervision effort from the Bank at an&#13;
average of 18 staff-weeks per fiscal year during the first two years and, thereafter, 12 staff-&#13;
weeks per fiscal year (see Annex E, page 46).&#13;
4.10   A mid-term review, scheduled for March, 2000, would be conducted to evaluate&#13;
project progress, the impact of project objectives and to assess the status of actions to be&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
V. BENEFITS, RISKS AND PARTICIPATORY APPROACH&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1    Component 1: Social Policy Development. The main benefits of the component will&#13;
be more efficient and effective social safety net policy formulation, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. The Government spent an estimated $499 million on social security cash benefits&#13;
in 1995, but the effectiveness of this spending is not well known given the paucity of good&#13;
data. Undeveloped information systems and skill gaps result in imprecise Government&#13;
evaluation of benefit policy options at the design stage, causing policies which fail to achieve&#13;
their goals, or do so at a high cost, thereby precipitating budget crises. The component will&#13;
support development of a strategic plan for social policy development, an improved human&#13;
resources policy in the MSSL, a policy monitoring and evaluation plan, and an applied&#13;
training program in social policy.&#13;
*  Fiscal impact through productivity improvements: The MSSL employs 94 staff.&#13;
The current organization is highly inefficient, and less than 50 percent of staff time&#13;
is devoted to core policy development tasks. Much time is unnecessarily spent on&#13;
adjudicating individual and municipal issues on a case by case basis (in a ministry&#13;
with roughly half the social policy development staff of its Irish counterpart, a&#13;
country of equivalent size). The strategic management approach to operations will&#13;
allow the MSSL to reorient and redeploy its existing staff resources to better deliver&#13;
and implement policy. As a result of this reorientation, the percent of MSSL staff&#13;
time devoted to core policy development tasks is expected to increase to over 75&#13;
percent by 2000. Thus, no increase in staff is expected despite an increase in the&#13;
complexity of MSSL tasks resulting from the ongoing social security reform&#13;
program. Cumulative staff savings are estimated at US$126,000 in 1995 terms&#13;
(equivalent to 22 percent of the departments' current staff budget over the same&#13;
period) as compared with the non-project scenario.  The municipal/MSSL&#13;
partnerships will define shared objectives and areas of mutual competence, while&#13;
cultivating the development of best practice in social assistance benefit&#13;
administration.&#13;
*  Fiscal impact through better policy: This component will provide the MSSL with&#13;
the tools it needs to formulate more effective policies, improving the efficiency of&#13;
fiscal expenditures comprising a substantial percentage of GDP.&#13;
* Cost recovery: Not applicable for this component.&#13;
*  Poverty impact: This component will provide the Government with the capacity&#13;
for improved targeting of benefits through better policy monitoring and evaluation&#13;
mechanisms. Improved policy analysis will also permit better anticipation of the&#13;
likely impact of transition policy measures on the poor, so that efficient and&#13;
effective compensatory measures can be designed if required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
*   Non-project scenario:  In the absence of a project, the following could be&#13;
anticipated:   (i) inefficient and inflexible organization for developing and&#13;
implementing social policy; (ii) poor oversight of social service delivery agencies;&#13;
(iii) irregular and unreliable policy monitoring and evaluation; (iv) inefficient work&#13;
organization at the MSSL, and weak coordination with the municipalities; and (v)&#13;
less skilled managerial and line staff.&#13;
*  Alternatives considered: During project design, the MSSL undertook a review of&#13;
its work organization with the assistance of foreign and local consultants, and&#13;
assessed a range of options for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of MSSL&#13;
operations. Options rejected included the creation of a new Department in the&#13;
Ministry (too expensive), and a merger of two social assistance and social care&#13;
divisions (functionally inappropriate).&#13;
*  Beneficiaries: This component will benefit: (i) MSSL clients (the Government,&#13;
Seimas, and municipalities) by improving the quality and presentation of policy&#13;
proposals that are produced by the Ministry (100 percent of legislative proposals&#13;
to Seimas and Government are to have analysis of fiscal and social implications&#13;
attached by 1999); and (ii) the population, particularly the poor or those at the&#13;
margin, through a better anti-poverty interventions based on an improved&#13;
understanding of Lithuanian household consumption, income, and behavior.&#13;
* Monitoring and evaluation: A monitoring plan was agreed during appraisal, and&#13;
includes key development impact indicators (see Annex A, page 35).  The&#13;
Operational Manual includes a more detailed plan that outlines milestones and&#13;
outcome indicators for each key step.&#13;
5.2    Component 2: Community Social Services Pilot Projects: This component will pilot two&#13;
community based social service models to demonstrate that these services are generally more&#13;
effective and less expensive than institutional care.&#13;
* Fiscal impact: It is estimated that the three Multi-Service Centers will serve a total&#13;
of 1,655 clients. Of these, roughly 1,158 will be diverted from institutional&#13;
placement. The average annual savings per individual diverted is estimated at&#13;
US$1,863 (based on the higher costs of institutional beds), saving the Government&#13;
US$2,157,354 per year. It is estimated that the Education Center for Disabled&#13;
Children will have ongoing costs that are slightly less than institutional beds (based&#13;
on an average of 24 children served per year), while providing better service to&#13;
those children kept out of institutions.&#13;
* Cost recovery Most of these services are currently provided free of charge. This&#13;
issue will be examined as part of the proposed social service financing study. A&#13;
decision on cost recovery will be guided by the study results, and this issue will be&#13;
considered during the mid-term evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
* Poverty impact: The project will improve the network of community based&#13;
services in the municipalities in order to help those individuals in extreme need,&#13;
many of whom are poor or living on the margin, to lead more productive and&#13;
satisfying lives. The service areas of the six pilots have a population of 893,400,&#13;
or about 24 percent of the total population of the country.&#13;
*  Non-project scenario:  In the absence of a project, increased reliance on&#13;
institutional care for populations at risk (the elderly, handicapped, and children),&#13;
leading to more expensive and less effective interventions at the community level,&#13;
would be anticipated.&#13;
*  Alternatives considered:  During project preparation, a competitive tendering&#13;
process for the community pilots was developed and implemented with foreign&#13;
technical assistance. The six community-based service pilots were selected from&#13;
the sixteen responses to a tender offer sent to each of the 56 municipalities in&#13;
Lithuania. This was the first tender offer ever conducted in the social services in&#13;
Lithuania (see para. 2.8, page 10). A nation-wide social worker training program&#13;
was rejected as overly-ambitious given current institutional capacity.&#13;
-   Beneficiaries: This component will benefit disabled, elderly, children at risk, and&#13;
other populations as identified at the community level. It is hoped that a client&#13;
survey conducted by 1999 will show that over 50 percent of clients are satisfied&#13;
with services, and that a mid-term review that year will show that the recurrent&#13;
costs per person served are consistently lower than the recurrent costs per&#13;
institutionalized person in all pilots.&#13;
e   Monitoring and evaluation: After the six pilot projects have been operating for two&#13;
years, a mid-term, formative evaluation will be conducted to determine the&#13;
advisability of replicating the pilots, to be followed by a second evaluation of the&#13;
six centers after five years. A monitoring plan was agreed during appraisal, and&#13;
includes key development impact indicators (see Annex A, page 35).  The&#13;
Operational Manual includes a more detailed plan that outlines milestones and&#13;
outcome indicators for each key step.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.3    Implementation capacity. Owing in part to initial overestimation of the Borrowers'&#13;
project management skills and experience with international procurement, social sector&#13;
projects in Eastern Europe tended to proceed much slower than was predicted at appraisal.&#13;
Project designs are now being simplified, greater attention is being paid to ownership up&#13;
front, and the role of project management in implementation is being strengthened. These&#13;
lessons have been incorporated in the design of this project. Work was undertaken during&#13;
project preparation to strengthen Borrower capacity, including training in project design and&#13;
management and development of the PCU. The inexperience in implementing externally&#13;
financed projects in the executing agencies remains a project risk. To support project&#13;
implementation, and especially disbursement, technical assistance in project management has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
been included in the project. Disbursement projections for the first 18 months of the project&#13;
are cautious, reflecting this risk.&#13;
5.4    Better capacity might not be used. This project is an institutional development&#13;
intervention, whose objective is to improve policy design and implementation. However, full&#13;
implementation of the project activities will not guarantee that the analytical results and&#13;
policy recommendations will be accepted by the Government and Seimas (Parliament) -- only&#13;
that decision-makers should be better informed on the options. Through the policy dialogue,&#13;
the Bank will work with the Government to reduce this risk.&#13;
5.5    Financing and Pilot Replication. The community social service pilots face the&#13;
additional risk that local governments will have difficulty financing recurrent project costs&#13;
over the long run or may lower specified standards in order to reduce costs. As a condition&#13;
of participation in the project, the municipalities have promised financing for all recurrent&#13;
costs of the pilot project over the project period. The project's financing study will identify&#13;
ways to redirect existing funding toward community-based services, facilitating long-term&#13;
funding and replication of the pilot projects. Cost recovery mechanisms for both pilots may&#13;
include the collection of fees for services provided by both pilots.&#13;
C. Participatory Approach&#13;
5.6    Throughout the preparation process, care has been taken to ensure strong local&#13;
ownership of the project. An initial preparation workshop held in September 1994, used&#13;
GTZ's "ZOPP" methodology, which stresses client participation and ownership. It is&#13;
designed to rationalize and systematize previous work, and to reach agreement on project&#13;
objectives and components. As a result of this workshop, the Lithuanian team acquired a&#13;
clearer understanding of what preparing a Bank-financed project implies on their part,&#13;
increasing their participation and involvement. In addition, the workshop helped to develop&#13;
project planning matrices (systematic tools for monitoring project preparation and&#13;
implementation) in which key project activities have been defined and implementation&#13;
schedules specified.&#13;
5.7    A follow-up workshop was held in September, 1995 which further strengthened&#13;
ownership and commitment through a review of all project objectives and assumptions,&#13;
working group development and ratification of project activity plans. The first draft of the&#13;
implementation and monitoring plan was also prepared during this workshop (in English and&#13;
Lithuanian). Representatives of key stakeholders' groups, including pensioners and the&#13;
Seimas, participated in selected workshop sessions.&#13;
D. Environmental Impact&#13;
5.8    Environmental category C ("No appreciable environmental impact") has been given&#13;
consistent with the provisions of Operational Directive 4.01, Annex E. The proposed project&#13;
is not expected to have a negative environmental impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
A. Agreements Reached Prior to Negotiations&#13;
6.1    Prior to negotiations, the Government submitted the following:&#13;
(a) a letter from the Minister of Finance to the World Bank confirming the&#13;
Government's request for a loan;&#13;
(b) a draft of the Operational Manual for Bank review, including equipment lists,&#13;
training plans, consultancy plans, and a civil works plan; implementation&#13;
arrangements between the MSSL and the municipalities and a management plan&#13;
for the community social service pilots; and a draft monitoring plan with&#13;
performance indicators and reporting requirements (para. 4.2, page 25);&#13;
(c) by-laws for the Policy Evaluation Fund (PEF) acceptable to the Bank, and a plan&#13;
acceptable to the Bank for implementing and funding the PEF (para. 1.15, page&#13;
5);&#13;
(d) an acceptable outline of the MSSL strategic plan approved by MSSL&#13;
management (para. 1. 14, page 5); and&#13;
(e) evidence that six implementation agreements were executed on behalf of the&#13;
Government and participating municipalities (para. 3.7, page 17).&#13;
B. Agreements Reached During Negotiations&#13;
6.2    During negotiations, the following agreements were reached:&#13;
(a) on performance indicators for all components (para 4.6, page 27);&#13;
(b) on reporting requirements for the project (para 4.8, page 28);&#13;
(c) that the Government of Lithuania will find alternative financing, in the event that&#13;
proposed grant financing would not be confirmed (para. 3.6, page 17); and&#13;
(d) on the maximum amount, nature of items that will be eligible for retroactive&#13;
financing, and the effective date for retroactive financing (para. 3.21, page 22).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
6.3    As conditions of loan effectiveness, the Government would cause:&#13;
(a) The Borrower will have in place a project expenditure management system with&#13;
MSSL acceptable to the Bank (para 3.27, page 24).&#13;
(b) The PCU will have been established within MSSL, with functions and&#13;
responsibilities acceptable to the Bank and a project director and key staff whose&#13;
qualifications, experience and terms of reference are acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
have been appointed (para. 4.4, page 27).&#13;
(c) The Borrower will have entered into arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for&#13;
the provision of project management advice to the PCU (para 4.4, page 27).&#13;
(d) The Borrower will have adopted an Operational Manual satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
(para. 4.2, page 25).&#13;
(e) A Project Implementation Agreement will have been executed on behalf of the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and MSSL on terns and conditions satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
for the purposes of the Project (para. 3.7, page 18).&#13;
C. Recommendation&#13;
6.4    Subject to the above conditions and assurances, the project would constitute a&#13;
suitable basis for a Bank loan of $3.70 million equivalent. The borrower would be the&#13;
Republic of Lithuania.&#13;

            The Social Policy and Community Social
            Services Development Project will support the Government of
            Lithuania in providing social security to the population at
            an affordable cost, through institutional development
            activities to improve (1) the capacity to analyze social
            policy at all stages, and (2) community social care
            services.  This will be achieved through the institutional
            development of the Ministry of Social Security and Labor
            (MSSL).  The project will assist the government by
            (1)developing the MSSL's  capacity to design,
            implement, monitor, and evaluate social safety net policies;
            (2) reducing institutionalization of groups at risk through
            developing, testing, and replicating new community-based
            social service models; and (3) developing MSSL project
            management capacity.  The project comprises three
            components: (1) social policy development to improve
            resource use in the MSSL and to monitor, evaluate, and
            implement policy; (2)community social service pilots to set
            up, monitor, and evaluate community multi-service and
            disabled children centers; and (3) project management to
            support the implementation of project activities by
            financing local consulting services, technical assistance
            and training in procurement, and required Project
            Coordination Unit (PCU) equipment.
