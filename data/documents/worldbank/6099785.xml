The Small Town Pilot Project in Peru&#13;
&#13;
A Private-Public and Social Partnership&#13;
to Change Water and Sanitation&#13;
Management Models&#13;
&#13;
The Small Town Pilot Project (STPP) is an initiative implemented by the Vice Ministry of Construction&#13;
and Sanitation of Peru, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program administered by the World Bank. This project aims to improve water and sanitation&#13;
services through new management models based on an innovative approach where the municipality&#13;
associated with the community delegates the service administration to a local specialized operator.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   The STPP aims to improve water and sanitation services through the active par-&#13;
   ticipation of the community, the municipality and local operators in the selection,&#13;
   operation and monitoring of a new water and sanitation service model designed&#13;
   to ensure better service delivery and sustainability.&#13;

            The Small Town Pilot Project (STPP) is
            an initiative implemented by the Vice Ministry of
            Construction and Sanitation of Peru, the Canadian
            International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Water and
            Sanitation Program administered by the World Bank. This
            project aims to improve water and sanitation services
            through new management models based on an innovative
            approach where the municipality associated with the
            community delegates the service administration to a local
            specialized operator.
