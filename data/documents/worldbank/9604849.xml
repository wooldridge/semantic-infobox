            Economic impacts of sanitation in Cambodia
            : a five-country study conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao
            PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam under the Economics of
            Sanitation Initiative (ESI)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The sanitation impact study, initiated
            by the World Bank water and sanitation program, aims to
            generate sound evidence on the negative impacts of existing
            sanitation and hygiene conditions and the potential benefits
            of improvements in sanitation and hygiene in Cambodia. In
            this study, quantitative assessment is conducted on the
            economic impacts of poor sanitation and hygiene on health,
            water resource, tourism and other welfare impacts. In
            addition to the quantitative evaluation, the study also
            discusses the effects of poor sanitation on various
            qualitative dimensions including health-related quality of
            life, intangible user preferences, life decisions, and the
            quality of the surrounding environment. The analysis focused
            on a narrow definition of sanitation, related to human
            excreta. However, there were instances in which sanitation
            as it relates to gray water and solid waste were also
            included. In measuring the impacts, the study uses a
            peer-reviewed methodology developed specifically for this
            study, which draws on established methods and, where these
            do not exist, develops new approaches to capture the impacts
            of poor sanitation. For improving policy interpretation of
            the results, the study distinguishes between financial and
            economic impacts, and presents for rural/urban areas and
            different geographical groupings at zonal level. Overall,
            the study finds that poor sanitation leads to economic
            losses. These economic losses are equivalent to 7.2 percent
            of the Cambodia's Gross Domestic product (GDP) in 2005.
            This amount is roughly equivalent to the contribution of the
            fishery sector, to the GDP, or twice the contribution of the
            forestry sector.
