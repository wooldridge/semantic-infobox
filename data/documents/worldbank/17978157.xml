Q:I'm William Becker with the George Washington Universityand the Business History Group.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I'm Lou Golambos with Johns Hopkins University and alsoBusiness History Group.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I am Jochen Kraske in the Historical Office of The WorldBank Group.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I am William Ryrie, the Executive Vice President of theIFC [International Finance&#13;
Corporation].&#13;
&#13;
Q: Sir William, we'd like to begin by asking you todescribe briefly your educational&#13;
background.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: After school in both India and Edinburgh, I went toEdinburgh University where I did&#13;
a four year course whichended in an M.A. I studied various subjects including someeconomics&#13;
and majored, as you would say in this country, in history. That was from 1947 to 1951. That's the&#13;
extent ofmy formal education.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Can you tell us anything more about your historystudies?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I did a wide variety of kinds of history, but my mainarea of specialization was&#13;
European 19th century.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Could you describe briefly your career before coming toWashington in 1975?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes, I did two years in the army after university, whichwas compulsory national&#13;
service. I spent one year in Malaya,as it then was. Then I joined the Colonial Office, which&#13;
waspart of the British Government Civil Service. I was admitted to the Administrative Grade of&#13;
the British Civil Service in the Colonial Office and spent nine years there, including two years on&#13;
a secondment to Uganda. I then joined the Treasuryin 1962 and remained a member of the&#13;
Treasury for 20 years,doing a variety of jobs and specializing on the overseas sideof things.&#13;
&#13;
I was, for a while, the point man on internationalmonetary questions. I had a major hand in the&#13;
organizationof the devaluation of 1967--the practical sides of it. I wasthe chief personal assistant&#13;
to the Chancellor of theExchequer for a couple of years, 1969 to 1971. Then I workedon the&#13;
public expenditure control side of the Treasury for awhile. After my stint at this British version&#13;
of the OMB [U.S. Office of Management and Budget], Iwas sent to Washington as the Executive&#13;
Director of the Bankand [International Monetary] Fund and Economic Minister at the Embassy.&#13;
Thatappointment lasted about four years. After that, I went backto a senior position in London.&#13;
The title of the job wasSecond Permanent Secretary, Domestic Economy, which was an&#13;
impossibly wide subject. In fact, I spent a great deal of mytime on the affairs of nationalized&#13;
industries, which werejust beginning to be privatized then. I then spent two yearsas Permanent&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                     2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Secretary of the Overseas DevelopmentAdministration, the ODA, and then I came to IFC in&#13;
1984.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I'd like to turn to that period when you served asEconomic Minister of the British Embassy&#13;
in Washington, from'75 to '79. Since you served in several capacities as anExecutive Director of&#13;
the Bank and the IMF and as an Embassyofficial, we'd like you to describe how you divided&#13;
your timebetween your various duties. EDs of other countries usuallydon't have as many&#13;
responsibilities as you did.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I won't go into a great detail on this, but there werehistorical reasons for it. The&#13;
position I occupied was, hadbeen the Treasury Representative in Washington. Its originsdate&#13;
back to World War II. The Treasury set up a seniorposition in Washington to manage the Lend-&#13;
Lease Programduring the War and it continued afterward. However, even inthe early postwar&#13;
period, the financial relationship betweenthe U.S. and the U.K. was extremely important.&#13;
Sterling was thesecond reserve currency, and London, Washington and New Yorkcomprised the&#13;
entire international monetary system. By the1970s, the U.K. was a great deal less important.&#13;
Sterling was declining, and the U.K. was no longer the single most important country, but, the&#13;
Embassy still had a very strong and close relationship with the Treasury. I was, in effect,the&#13;
ambassador from the British Treasury to the AmericanTreasury, and quite a number of things&#13;
happened during mytime which made that role quite active.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to my duties as â&#128;&#156;Treasury Ambassador,â&#128;? I hadtwo more pressing responsibilities--&#13;
membership of the Boards[of Executive Directors] of the Bank and Fund. I have to say that the&#13;
IMF took upmost of my time. During my tenure, the U.K. made a majordrawing on the Fund,&#13;
and my duties there required a lot ofattention. Although I probably gave more time to the&#13;
Bankthan my predecessors and successors, I still devoted roughly40 percent of my time to the&#13;
Fund, 40 percent to the Embassy,and 20 percent to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did you have much contact with the IFC during thoseyears?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: The IFC, I have to admit, appeared to be relativelyminor part of the Bank Group at&#13;
that stage. Of course I tooksome interest in Bank and IFC projects, but there wasn'tenough time,&#13;
given the roles that I had, to focus on them inany great detail. Performingwell at my three jobs&#13;
requiredthree good deputies to underpin me on each job. In the caseof the Bank, I focused mainly&#13;
on policy issues and not muchon projects, which I left to my Alternate, mostly. I did a&#13;
few projects just to get some sense of what was going on, but generally I focused on policy&#13;
issues in the Bank Board. As for IFC, there were very few policy issues arising there, soI wasn't&#13;
very involved with the organization.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Who did you deal with at Treasury while you held thisthree-headed position? Could you&#13;
describe thoserelationships?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Ed [Edwin H. III] Yeo was the main person, as Under Secretary forMonetary Affairs,&#13;
as it was called then. It's now calledUnder Secretary for International Affairs, I think. He wasin&#13;
that position through the end of the [Gerald R.] Ford Administration,so during the whole of my&#13;
first year and a quarter I wasseeing him pretty regularly. That was an interesting butâ&#128;&#148;attimes--&#13;
&#13;
                                      William S. Ryrie&#13;
                       August 10 and September 17, 1993 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
difficult relationship. The British Government hadput itself in a highly vulnerable position. We&#13;
had beenfollowing policies in the U.K. that made us very open tocriticism, and we got it. The&#13;
U.S., meaning both theTreasury and the Fed [U.S. Federal Reserve System], at various points&#13;
told us--in nouncertain terms--that we really had to tighten things up, andeventually we did.&#13;
There were a number of us in the machinewho rather agreed with the arguments that were&#13;
coming fromthe other side of the table.&#13;
&#13;
However, in the course of thenegotiations leading up to the British drawing on the Fund, Iwas&#13;
frequently in touch with Ed Yeo. In the nextAdministration the position was occupied by Tony&#13;
[Anthony M.]Solomon, wholater became president of the New York Fed [Federal Reserve Bank&#13;
of New York] and who hasremained a good friend. I got along with him very well, butadmittedly&#13;
the difficult issues were past. Our drawing hadbeen done, and sterling had begun its&#13;
recovery.Nevertheless, we got on very well. Fred Bergsten was theAssistant Secretary on the&#13;
international side, and I workedquite a bit with him, too.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did you remain close to Bergsten?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. We are quite friendly. I see him from time totime. I see Tony Solomon, too.&#13;
&#13;
Q: With whom among the EDs at the World Bank did you workmost closely?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, inevitably, the American chair--Ed [Edward R.] Fried. He wasthe [Jimmy]&#13;
Carter Administration man. Eberhard Kurth was a verygood German member. Before him was a&#13;
man called HansJanssen, who was not so effective. Eberhard Kurth was one ofthe most effective&#13;
members of the Board.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In what sense would you say that he was effective, asopposed to some of the others?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Oh, just that he spoke sense and carried weight. Heconvinced people. When he spoke,&#13;
he used few words andpeople were influenced. That's what makes a good ED.Jacques Wahl, who&#13;
was also my colleague on the Fund Boardwhere I saw a great deal more of him and who's now&#13;
with BNP [Banque Nationale de Paris]in Paris, was also extremely effective. I'd have to&#13;
thinkharder to remember other members. We used to work quite alot with the Indian ED, but I&#13;
can't remember his name.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did the Board change its way of operation in the yearsthat you were there?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No, I wouldn't say it did. Throughout my time there wehad the same President. When&#13;
I came, [Robert S.]McNamara was wellentrenched. He'd been in the job six or seven years, and&#13;
hestayed right through my time and a little after. Hedominated the Board. I'm sure other people&#13;
have said thesame thing to you. The relationship between the Board andthe President was rather&#13;
different from what it has sincebecome. He was a strong leader. He made it clear that hewas the&#13;
boss of the staff as well as the Chairman of theBoard. When any Board member put a question to&#13;
the staff, hewould not allow the staff member to reply until he hadphrased the question in the&#13;
way he wanted it answered.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: Was that appreciated by the members of the Board?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, I can't speak for the rest. I appreciated itbecause he was quite responsive to&#13;
members of the Board.McNamara controlled the question and answer process. Hewould tell the&#13;
staff to address this question or deal withthat point. Now, I suppose there were members of the&#13;
Boardwho resented the fact that he dominated the proceedings inthat way. As for me, I was&#13;
representing a strong country(the U.K. was bigger and more important in the mid-1970s thanit is&#13;
now), and we had always had a close relationship withthe Bank Management. I really used to&#13;
rely on seeing BobMcNamara in his own office once a fortnight. If I reallywanted something&#13;
done or something concerned me, I wouldn'traise it in the Board; I would raise it with the&#13;
President. Iwould typically ask for a meeting (I'd usually get 5:30 or6:00 in the evening), and he&#13;
would chat with me for a whilebefore going home at the end of the day. My&#13;
predecessorrecommended to me that I cultivate a good relationship withthe President. He said&#13;
that was the most important thing todo. He also told me to cultivate a good relationship withthe&#13;
Secretary of the Treasury. My relationship with theSecretary of the Treasury one was not as&#13;
close as mine withMcNamara. By and large, McNamara and I got on pretty well.He was doing&#13;
the kind of things we (the U.K.) wanted so wedidn't need to make a fuss about things. Of course,&#13;
we'dhave disagreements now and again.&#13;
&#13;
Q: About spending?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q: The scope?&#13;
&#13;
Q: Or changing the focus of the Bank's work?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. McNamara made the Bank more of a developmentalorganization. He focused on&#13;
the important issues ofdevelopment. Of course, he also tended to dominate Bankoperations, but&#13;
this wasn't a new pattern of behavior forBank presidents. Didn't [John J.]McCloy take the&#13;
president's job withthe understanding that he would have control of theManagement and the&#13;
Board would then go along with him? TheBoard had accepted that rather subordinate role ever&#13;
since.&#13;
&#13;
As for the U.K., we took the attitude, â&#128;&#156;Well, we are one ofthe major shareholders. We can&#13;
always get ourselves heard ifwe really want to. So we'll go along with this.â&#128;? Thingshave changed&#13;
a lot since then.&#13;
&#13;
Q: That's part of what we want to discuss next. Did theAmerican economy's difficulties in the&#13;
late 1970s affect anyof your working relationships?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I'd have to think. The British Government itself wasgetting into trouble all over again.&#13;
We had a terrible yearin 1976. The second oil shock had caused a lot of inflationon both sides of&#13;
the Atlantic. During this period, Ed Yeowas a little imperial with me. He often told us what&#13;
weshould do, and I remember once having a discussion with himand asking if he could imagine a&#13;
situation where the IMFdisapproved of American policies. He couldn't. Tony Solomonwas less&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    5&#13;

&#13;
inclined to be like that. However, he had lessbasis for it as time went on. After all, he had a&#13;
horrifyingbudget deficit, about $30 billion!&#13;
&#13;
Q: The interest rates, the rate of inflation, and theinternational competition was really kicking&#13;
in those years.Did that result in any uneasiness on the other side?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Oh, yes. There was uneasiness. We seemed to be thewhipping boy in the early stages.&#13;
In the later stages,however, everybody was in the dog house, and the U.S. was notin a position to&#13;
lecture.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Turning back a bit to the fact that you had severalofficial responsibilities, we believe that&#13;
aspect of your jobgave you a unique perspective on some of the institutions inwhich you served.&#13;
In particular, we are interested in thedifferences between the workings of the World Bank and&#13;
theInternational Monetary Fund. Therefore, I'd like you tocompare a bit the intra-Board&#13;
relationships at the IMF andthe Bank, and the relationship of these Boards to the heads&#13;
of these institutions.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I haven't got anything very novel to say on that issue.Yes, the Fund Board was more&#13;
effective. The Bank Board was,I think, generally of slightly lesser quality. I think theFund Board&#13;
was of higher quality. There was a strongtendency for the Bank Board (for reasons we've just&#13;
beentalking about) to go along with the Management. The Bank hada very strong leader at that&#13;
time, so its Board was a littlesubmissive and not very impressive in its debates. The FundBoard&#13;
was, and I think still is, a somewhat more independentbody. Now, there was a tendency to accept&#13;
the Managementline, but the Management had to work a bit to get it acceptedand it was not&#13;
unknown for a proposal for a stand-by, forexample, to be modified. During my time the Fund&#13;
Board was aforum for the discussion of all varieties of major issues--the operation of the SDR&#13;
[special drawing rights] system, sales of gold, and otherinternational monetary questions. These&#13;
were opendiscussions where the Management line did not always prevail.&#13;
&#13;
As a Fund Board member, I felt that I could make asignificant contribution. Another important&#13;
differencebetween the Bank and Fund Boards was that in the Bank Boardthe ED representing a&#13;
country for which a project was beingproposed traditionally remained silent, whereas in the&#13;
Fund,when the U.K. was looking for a borrowing, I was one of thespokesmen. I and the&#13;
Management together had agreed on aproposal. Management introduced it, and then I would&#13;
speakto it, defending the record of the British Government andsupporting the proposal. In short, I&#13;
had a far more activerole in Fund discussions than in Bank discussions. I supposethat's why I&#13;
tended to spend a bit more time in the FundBoard. It was more interesting, frankly.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Were you a good diplomat at Board meetings? Did you actas a solicitor acts when he argues&#13;
on behalf of his client?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. Oh, yes. I was a representative of my government.Obviously I wasn't happy with&#13;
all of its policies, but thatnever came out at the Board.&#13;
&#13;
Q: As I read over some of the things that you have written,one thing that surprised me was your&#13;
firm belief in thedelegation of authority.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Delegation and accountability, yes, in management.&#13;
&#13;
Q: A bit more than McNamara, at the time?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: At the time, there was a great deal of unhappiness aboutMcNamara, because (a) he&#13;
was regarded as tremendouslyautocratic, and (b) he was regarded as out of touch. Hedidn't see&#13;
people. He was in some ways a shy man, but inother ways, he was not. He didn't see people of&#13;
middle orjunior rank, and he didn't walk the corridors and shakepeople's hands. I think there was&#13;
a management weaknessthere. Another management weakness stemmed from the factthat he was&#13;
tremendously able and a total workaholic. He hadtaken over the Bank when it was relatively&#13;
small, and it hadgrown with him. As a result, McNamara just felt that hecould take all the&#13;
important decisions, and he did. That wasa problem. The Bank could not continue to be run in&#13;
thatmanner, especially by a newcomer, and especially by anewcomer with less energy than he. In&#13;
that sense McNamaracreated a management problem.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How would you characterize the differences between thestaff/Board relationship at the Fund&#13;
and the staff/Boardrelationship at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: There was an interesting difference in style. I'vespoken about how McNamara would&#13;
direct the staff, and how hewould behave as the boss of the staff at the Board. In theFund the&#13;
Managing Director traditionally was Chairman of theBoard, but he detached himself a little from&#13;
the staff. Hedidn't instruct them in the same way as McNamara. Sometimes,he would take the&#13;
Board's side against the staff, but alwayswith great courtesy and tact. This was true for the&#13;
ManagingDirectors I served with, [H. Johannes] Witteveen and [Jacques] de Larosiere.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Others?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Since Management could not assume that it would get itsway in the Fund Board, the&#13;
Managing Director might spend abit more time talking to Board members outside the&#13;
Boardabout upcoming issues, but then, McNamara did that as well.If he thought something was&#13;
going to go wrong in the Board,he would have us all there to find out what was going tohappen&#13;
so he wouldn't be blindsided. He liked to have us allinto his little conference room. He always&#13;
wanted to knowwhat was going to happen in the Board.&#13;
&#13;
Q: He met with the whole Board?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. In that little conference room, the one thatBarber Conable used as his office. He&#13;
might have theSecretary of the Board there, who was Purviz Damry, but not usually any other&#13;
staff. These discussions tended to focuson policy issues, not specific projects. Salaries were&#13;
agood example. This was the kind of issue which wasfrequently a problem because the U.S.&#13;
objected to the salaryincreases that all the Europeans thought were necessary.Before a meeting of&#13;
that kind, McNamara would summon all ofus to his boardroom, and he would find out what was&#13;
going tohappen. If it really was going to be a disaster, he wouldpostpone the meeting.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Q: Can you talk a little bit about the relationship amongthe Board members in the Fund and in&#13;
the Bank? In the Bank,as I know it, there is a sharp division between Part I andPart II. Is the&#13;
same in the Fund?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Less so, I would say, less so. Members of the FundBoard tended, even if they were&#13;
Part II, to regard themselvesas international monetary officials concerned with managingthe&#13;
international monetary system. There were occasions whenthe Board split between Part I and&#13;
Part II countries, butthat was regarded as a rather bad thing. In the Bank, onthe other hand, this&#13;
division was a bit more accepted. Therewere certain developing country members in the Fund&#13;
Board whotook quite a tough line on international monetary issues. Iremember there was a&#13;
splendid ED called [Byanti] Kharmawan, anIndonesian who didn't give away anything very&#13;
easily. He wasan old Indonesian who spoke Dutch and the Managing Directorof course was&#13;
Dutch, as was the Dutch Director, [Pieter] Lieftinck. Occasionally the Board would break into&#13;
Dutch, with everybodyelse baffled.&#13;
&#13;
I would like to tell one little anecdote, since you areinterested in the comparisons. During my&#13;
first week at theBank and Fund, several Bank Vice Presidents came to pay acall as did many&#13;
heads of Fund Departments (the Fund'sequivalent to Vice Presidents). During those meetings, I&#13;
wasstruck by the fact that the Fund people talked about theworld economy, the international&#13;
monetary system, theinternational balance of payments, and internationalliquidity. The Bank&#13;
people, on the other hand, talked aboutwhat was going on in the Bank, and the problems with&#13;
Mr. McMamara and all that. They seemed to be much more inwardlooking--much more&#13;
preoccupied with institutional problems.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Are you saying that you found the working atmosphere atthe IMF, in some ways, more&#13;
professional than the atmospherein the Bank, at least during those four years?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. I think I would say that.&#13;
&#13;
Q: More professional and less political?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No. Not less political. I think everybody in the Fund,if anything, may be more&#13;
political because everybody knewthat political considerations lay behind all the financialand&#13;
economic arguments that we were using in the Board. Youcould never get away from politics.&#13;
Everyone understood thatthe American Director, Sam [Sam Y. Jr.] Cross in my time, had&#13;
explicitinstructions from his government. There were certain thingshe couldn't say. The major&#13;
countries tended to be moreconstrained than the smaller countries, of course. Now, thisis true in&#13;
both the Bank and the Fund, but most of the EDsrepresent a dozen countries, so they have a bit&#13;
more freedomthan the single country representatives. There have been oneor two grand old men&#13;
at the Fund like Pieter Lieftinck, who had been Minister of Finance of The Netherlands and who&#13;
wasquite senior when I was on the Fund Board. He spoke withpersonal authority. [Alexandre]&#13;
Kafka, who's still there, did as well.I don't think anybody on the Bank Board had that kind&#13;
ofstatus.&#13;
&#13;
Q: If we may, we'd like to move beyond your two years asSecond Permanent Secretary in the&#13;
British Treasury to thetime you served as the Permanent Secretary of the British Overseas&#13;

Development Administration. In particular, we areinterested in how the ODA worked with the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, the attitude in the ODA towards the World Bank wasvery positive. At the time&#13;
when I was in charge, we werevery much preoccupied with financial pressures. The [Margaret&#13;
H.]ThatcherAdministration was trying to cut the budget and went aboutit in the proper Treasury-&#13;
like manner. Treasury decided thatall our total aid monies must not rise above a certain&#13;
level.They didn't care too much how the ODA used the money, as longas we came in under&#13;
budget. The budget cuts put us in somehot water. Brussels was gobbling up a larger and&#13;
largershare of our shrinking budget. Now, we could have respondedto this problem by trying to&#13;
cut back on the World Bank sideof things, but we were very disinclined to do that because&#13;
wetended to feel that amongst the international institutionsthis was the best way of spending&#13;
money.&#13;
&#13;
Q: This was the co-financing?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: These were our payments to IDA [International Development Association]. We&#13;
tended to feel thatIDA money was a hell of a lot better spent than Lome [Convention] money and&#13;
the European Development Fund money. The European systemhas improved since then. I think&#13;
they've got their acttogether a bit on certain points.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Fill us in a little bit on the difference between theWorld Bank, Lome, and the European&#13;
Development Fund.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, the most flagrant bit of misuse of money in theEuropean system was food aid. It&#13;
aided European farmers muchmore than the people who needed food. Subsidized&#13;
commoditiestended to flood and destroy local markets and undermine localagriculture.&#13;
Generally, they were a bad form of aid, and Ibelieve that's all been quite radically reformed since&#13;
then.&#13;
&#13;
Another feature of the Lome system was that it was very, verypolitical and each country was--&#13;
more or less--given anallocation of money. This was their entitlement, soconditionality was&#13;
extremely ineffective. The Bank,meanwhile, was being much more prudent. It didn't tell itsclient&#13;
countries that they were entitled to X amount ofdollars regardless of their policies.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Would you say that the Bank was taking a longer view ofthe development process?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: They were more involved in how the money was going to bespent. Lome was much&#13;
more inclined to hand it over and letthe local government do what they wanted. They did&#13;
getsomewhat involved. They knew how the money was going to bespent, but that was very much&#13;
at the discretion of therecipient government. Don't forget that the entire processwas highly&#13;
politicized. The French would argue for moremoney for the former French colonies. The British&#13;
were neveras good at those games as the French were. So, yes, thefeeling in the ODA was pretty&#13;
positive about the Bank, butparticularly about IDA, rather than IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What is your view of the ODA's co-financingrelationships?&#13;

RYRIE: Co-financing with, with the Bank or . . .&#13;
&#13;
Q: With the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Now?&#13;
&#13;
Q: No, back then.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: The business of aid coordination was really justbuilding up in those days, as was the&#13;
consultative groupssystem with the Bank in the chair. We were strongly forcoordination and we&#13;
thought the Bank was the rightinstitution to manage it, but I don't remember us jointlyfinancing&#13;
very many projects. I wouldn't be astonished,however, to find that my memory is at fault.&#13;
&#13;
Q: At the beginning of your tenure at ODA you indicate ahigh regard for the Bank's operations.&#13;
Did your view of theBank or the IMF or of the IFC change at all during your time there?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No, I don't think it did. With my background as an ED,I tended to be rather more pro-&#13;
Bank than some others mighthave been.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Was there was a point in your career where your personalinterest in the development&#13;
problems and that really soared,or did you always gravitate toward those kinds of problems?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Because I grew up in India, I felt drawn to developingcountries early. While in the&#13;
Army I didn't go to Malaya bychance. I asked to go to there. Then I was in Africa, andmy career&#13;
at the Colonial Office. After a while, I couldn'treally see where that was going, so hungry for&#13;
somefinancial expertise and knowledge, I went into the Treasury,which was quite fascinating. I&#13;
was delighted to find that,although I was in the UK Treasury, I could deal withinternational&#13;
things. I was always much more interested inthat than domestic matters. When the ODA came&#13;
up, it was anopportunity to go back to an old interest, really. TheWashington period further&#13;
strengthened my interest in thedeveloping world, so, maybe I made a bit of a diversion andcame&#13;
back.&#13;
&#13;
Q: The Bank and the Fund were created in the shadow of theCold War. In the institutions' early&#13;
days the Cold Warmentality had a profound effect on Bank/Fund policy. Didthis situation change&#13;
at all in the late â&#128;&#158;70s/early â&#128;&#158;80s?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I don't recall anything that evidenced itself in myworking life. Reading newspapers is&#13;
another matter. I don'tremember it impinging very much. It was another world. Wedidn't get&#13;
much into security and military things. To us,the Soviet Union was remote world with which we&#13;
had nocontact.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So it never came up? China?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Maybe chaps like you were aware of China, but most of uswere paying very little&#13;
attention to China. China was acommunist country, and we didn't pay it much attention. Idon't&#13;
recall any significant change in that general scene inthe â&#128;&#158;70s or early â&#128;&#158;80s.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did those kinds of questions come up in the choice ofprojects or investments? That Cold&#13;
War context did not comeup in any precise way? It was just in the background?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I think I missed the shift you're speaking of because Iwas back in the U.K. on the&#13;
domestic side. The shift was the[Ronald W.] Reagan shift, and I suppose there must have been&#13;
quite anumber of issues that the Fund considered in the early â&#128;&#158;80sin Africa, where the Cold War&#13;
factor was important, but Iwasn't involved then. I left at the end of â&#128;&#158;79, a yearbefore Reagan was&#13;
elected. I don't recall it being atremendously key factor in ODA deliberations either. Therewas&#13;
always the background of this huge amount of aid going toEgypt and Israel, but it didn't impinge&#13;
on my work very much.&#13;
&#13;
Q: But when you did come back to Washington into that work,then there was a marked&#13;
difference in . . .&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: In the Cold War context?&#13;
&#13;
Q: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Once again, I wasn't, I don't think that it impinged onour work terribly much. Of&#13;
course, we had to keep out ofcertain bits of the world where the Cold War was hot, likeAngola,&#13;
but I don't think there's a lot more to this.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I guess, then, that you didn't see the U.S. ED acting ina Cold War context.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No. In the Bank one tended to get irritated with theU.S. ED for a different reason. The&#13;
U.S. was the only onethat was prepared to put the interest of its own producers onthe table and&#13;
say, â&#128;&#156;We don't want these damaged.â&#128;? They hadthis extraordinary doctrine, which was based on&#13;
some act ofCongress, which said that the U.S. must not supportfacilities for the production of&#13;
something which is inâ&#128;&#156;oversupply.â&#128;? This meant that if you have a highlyinefficient copper&#13;
producer in New Mexico and you havesomebody in Chile who is a highly efficient producer, the&#13;
Bank and the IFC must not support the Chilean producer. TheChilean producer can find money&#13;
from somewhere else, but hemustn't get it from these institutions. This affected&#13;
othercommodities as well--steel, soybeans, and others. Thispattern has continued right up to&#13;
today. I don't think I canrecall any other member of the Board who was prepared to saythat he&#13;
opposed a project because it would hurt producers inhis own country. The other EDs thought that&#13;
this stance wasrather anti-developmental.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In returning to Washington in 1984, as we understand it,you were first to take a position in&#13;
External Affairs anddeal with IDA?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No. That was earlier. There was a possibility. [Alden W.]Clausen asked me if I would&#13;
take a position as a VicePresident responsible for IDA. I came over once--it musthave been about&#13;
the end of 1982--and I had an interview and Italked with him, but I decided not to take the job&#13;
because itwas very ill-defined. It was clear I was going to have nostaff, and I had enough sense&#13;
to realize that, in the Bank,without staff you are nothing. However, I must have stuck inClausen's&#13;
mind because when the IFC job came up, he asked meand I took it on the spot. I had no&#13;
hesitations about thatone. It was a quite different proposition.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, this represents a rather substantial change in yourcareer, too, in that you now work for&#13;
a public institution witha dedication to private enterprise, as opposed to a publicinstitution that is&#13;
oriented to the public enterprise. Didyou see the choice in those terms?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, I could see the way the wind was blowing, and wewere all going with that wind.&#13;
Whereas I was a convincedsocialist in my youth, I did get older and wiser&#13;
&#13;
Q: Could you date when you no longer felt that way?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, it was gradual, but I suppose the most significantchange was during the late â&#128;&#158;70s&#13;
when the Labor Government inBritain was doing rather badly.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Had your experience at ODA begun to change your thinkingabout these kinds of issues&#13;
between public and private?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No. I don't think so. However, that experience at ODAleft me feeling a little helpless&#13;
as to whether I was reallygetting at the real issues. The one hesitation I had abouttaking the IFC&#13;
job was that I felt that IFC was a slightlyperipheral organization, and I wasn't sure how&#13;
subordinate tothe Bank it was. I remember saying to myself that there werecertain advantages. I&#13;
could see it was a job that hadpotential and that the moment was right, and although itlooked a&#13;
rather small job, I said to myself, "Maybe in awhile it will be a rather bigger job."&#13;
&#13;
Q: So when you first came in and you surveyed both theorganization and your staff, what kind&#13;
of response did youhave to that?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, on the whole I enjoyed my first period here. Forthe first time, I felt that I was&#13;
really in charge. That wasvery important to me. Although I was reporting to thePresident of the&#13;
Bank, in practice I was the Chief Executiveof this place. The fact that I had to deal with the&#13;
Boardwas quite important, but I always had the initiative. Ididn't have somebody giving me&#13;
instructions, which as a civilservant I had always found rather frustrating. I seem to begoing off&#13;
the subject a little bit, but my civil servicecareer in London was the most satisfactory when I was&#13;
at themiddle level, when I was the expert on some subject and theMinisters really needed me.&#13;
When I got to the top level,they didn't need me. I was just an advisor. I didn't takethe decisions,&#13;
and I didn't know as much as the people belowme. The IFC job, on the other hand, is a real&#13;
managementjob. I have to know my stuff and take decisions. I was quitenervous at the&#13;
beginning. I wondered how I could get myselfaccepted and take decisions and get things done,&#13;
but itworked out.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Q: At that point, did you feel that you had the kind ofstaff support you needed? You've&#13;
mentioned that before.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Initially, IFC appeared to me as a really rather ingrownplace, very much stuck in its&#13;
ways. It needed toopen out, and I was very keen to bring in some outsiders. Itried to do so, but I&#13;
didn't really succeed. Some people Iappointed from outside did not work out. The quality of the&#13;
staff was varied. There were clearly some extremely goodpeople, and some others who were not&#13;
so good. Nevertheless,it was a very close-knit institution which would reject aforeign body&#13;
unless the foreign body was the boss. I had tomake it clear that I was the boss. It's still like that a&#13;
bit.&#13;
&#13;
Q: It has been around for almost thirty years, and so youcan understand how it had become in-&#13;
grown.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: It hadn't changed its structure much during that period.It ran from 1956 to 1977 before&#13;
it had its first capitalincrease, which was then an enormous one. The first capitalwas a hundred&#13;
million, and then it went to six hundred andfifty million in 1977. When I arrived, I was&#13;
astonished tofind that I and all the department directors would sit aroundthe table and go through&#13;
every project to find out whatprogress was being made. Of course, I was completelybewildered. I&#13;
didn't know anything about any of theseprojects, and the numbers were getting quite high. Even&#13;
atthat stage, we were doing 70 projects a year.&#13;
&#13;
Q: That didn't strike you as odd?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: It was a hangover from the period when IFC was doing 20projects a year and when&#13;
the EVP [executive vice president] really did take thedecision to go ahead in each case&#13;
&#13;
Q: You had a different management style in mind?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, I had never managed a risk-taking institutionbefore. Coping with the Board&#13;
came as second-nature to me,but finding a proper system for taking business decisions,risk-&#13;
exposure decisions, was another matter. I didn't wantto do it all myself. I knew that I really&#13;
wasn't the rightperson to do it myself because I was not experienced in thisarea; therefore, I had&#13;
to rely on other people with moreexperience, and I had to get their cooperation. Gradually, I&#13;
began to change things. I changed the structure after I wasin about four months. First, I got rid of&#13;
one or two people,and then we changed the procedures about a year or so later.There were two&#13;
stages. In the first stage, we consulted withthe Bank's organizational group. .&#13;
&#13;
Q: Jim [James M.] Kearns?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Jim Kearns was not involved himself, but Richard Lynn and I got hold of a fellow&#13;
called John Hunt, who was aprofessor at the London Business School. He didn't do anormal&#13;
consultancy job for us. He just made a number ofvisits and took part in weekend-long&#13;
conferences where wedecided on the structure that I created. I had inherited astructure of&#13;
cylinders, where one person was in charge ofLatin America and Europe, another person was in&#13;
charge ofAfrica, and that was all. Everything went through the EVP.In its place, I decided to&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
create this matrix system (whichsome people thought was crazy) in which there was one&#13;
vicepresident in charge of all new investments, another vicepresident in charge of the portfolio&#13;
and some other thingsincluding capital markets, and a third vice president incharge of the&#13;
finances and general policy and planning. Inmy mind, the great merit of such a system was that&#13;
each ofthose three vice presidents had a corporate-wide view. Theyhad to look at the whole&#13;
corporation.&#13;
&#13;
I was very keen tocreate a little management group which would really run theplace. I&#13;
approached it in a completely arbitrary way,saying, "What size should that group be for an&#13;
institutionthis size?" My answer was four--me plus three. That's howwe got that number.&#13;
Eighteen months later we were beginningto have serious portfolio problems, so I made one of&#13;
thosevice presidents purely portfolio, and switched the capitalmarkets stuff over to the&#13;
operational side. Dan [Daniel F.] Adamssucceeded by Will [Wilfried E.] Kaffenberger did that&#13;
job. I think thatwas an effective way of dealing with our portfolio problem,which had become&#13;
fairly serious. We did have to take strongaction on that, and we got it turned around.&#13;
&#13;
I didn't have a lot of management consultants decidingthese things. I've had many encounters&#13;
with managementconsultants since then, however, and I've grown increasinglydistrustful. The&#13;
big reorganization which I did a year and aquarter ago, I did without them. Once again, we had&#13;
somebodyfrom London to give us some help, but he wasn't a majorfactor, once we knew where&#13;
we were going.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Could you just briefly describe one of those weeklymeetings? Did the people at the top of&#13;
the cylinders come inand argue for their particular program?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes, I was a little bit aware of "you scratch my back,I'll scratch yours. If you support&#13;
my project, I'll supportyours. And conversely, if you attack mine, I'll attack oneof yours." There&#13;
wasn't enough time for me to experience alot of it myself, however. This is one of the reasons&#13;
whythis matrix was a good idea. Under my matrix system, therewas only one person supervising&#13;
all the new business. Therecould be no mutual backscratching. More importantly,however, the&#13;
matrix forced responsibility down. The VicePresident in charge of new business couldn't handle&#13;
all theprojects. That was good, really. It meant that the VPs hadto rely heavily on the directors of&#13;
departments and the headsof the investment department. As a result, director levelpersonnel&#13;
became much more significant. They became the keypeople in IFC, and so they've remained.&#13;
&#13;
When we reformed theprocedures about a year later, we formalized that quite alot. Until then the&#13;
Investment Committee, which consisted ofthe senior management and myself would consider all&#13;
projectstwice: once at an early stage to decide whether to proceedwith appraisal and after&#13;
appraisal to decide whether toproceed to the Board. We decided to cut that out, and somepeople&#13;
couldn't understand why we cut out the second one andnot the first one. The Investment&#13;
Committee screenedprojects to make sure that they fitted in with IFC's policiesand that they were&#13;
suitable for their particular countries.This provided an opportunity for the senior staff, who had&#13;
alot of experience, to issue some warnings and guidance andsay, "Look out for this problem, or&#13;
that problem." Afterthat, however, responsibility for the projects lay with theInvestment&#13;
Department Director. He had to go through aprocess which ended with a formal decision&#13;
meeting, witheverybody concerned attending. That meeting had to beproperly recorded, so that if&#13;

&#13;
problems arose about thisproject later, we could see who took the decision. Thatamounted to&#13;
accountability. Now, that wasn't the end of theroad. The project still had to go to the Board. It&#13;
wouldstill come up through the Vice President, and me, and then tothe Board. The Vice&#13;
President's primary responsibility wasquality control. The Director would take the decisions, but&#13;
the Vice President could interfere if he thought that therewas serious risk.&#13;

Q: He had a veto power.&#13;

RYRIE: Yes, he certainly had a veto, yes. Jud [Judhvir] Parmar, theperson in that position as&#13;
the number of projects grew from70 to about 160, became increasingly adept at&#13;
interveningselectively. That was good. It meant that he could take alook at each one, and if he&#13;
detected a problem, he would haveeveryone involved with the project into his room to go overit.&#13;
He didn't try to cover the whole field. That seemed towork.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In making the early decision to do this, obviously youcame in and found problems with a&#13;
hidebound bureaucracy andits standard way of doing things. Did your decision alsostem from&#13;
some idea you had of changing the direction of theIFC? In other words, had you decided that the&#13;
IFC had somepotential to do things differently or expand its mission,and, as a result of that, did&#13;
you feel the need to change thestructure of the organization?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No. We could talk about what kind of mission I saw, butit didn't radically affect the&#13;
reorganization effort, exceptin fringe aspects like publicity and external relations.Those elements&#13;
were regarded as a waste of time in thisinstitution. Of course, it's very important that we&#13;
makeourselves known around the world, that people understand whowe are. I had a big fight to&#13;
get any serious attention givento that subject at all.&#13;
&#13;
Q: There's a place where you'd want to bring in a newperson!&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. I've haven't been successful on that score. I'vehad several dubious successes, at&#13;
any rate. I think we'vegot the right man now.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Is it hard to change people in your organization?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I think it's more difficult than it is in J. P. Morganor any other purely private&#13;
institution. I had to be rathercareful. I was an outsider. I wanted to manage by consensusas far as&#13;
possible. I sometimes imposed my will, but onlyafter consulting with my staff very carefully.&#13;
Onappointments, I consulted with them a lot. I didn't know thepeople very well, and they knew&#13;
them much better. However,in the Bank group, firing people is almost impossible. Whenyou&#13;
have somebody in a job who's hopeless, you can findsomeone else who's going to do it better,&#13;
but what are yougoing to do with the chap you kicked out?&#13;
&#13;
Q: You have to keep him.&#13;
&#13;
Q: It sounds like a university.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. It's tenure of a kind.&#13;

Q: Let me ask you about the reorganization, jumping ahead alittle bit.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Don't jump too far, because we need a lot more detail.&#13;
&#13;
Q: No.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You may be surprised that we are so interested in thedetails.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I am a little, yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, you see, we see this historically as a majorinnovation.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Which is the innovation?&#13;
&#13;
Q: The innovation is what happens to IFC. It becomes adifferent organization. It functions in&#13;
different ways, andit experiences substantial growth. The way you'vecharacterized the first 28&#13;
years fits with our picture of it.Now it's changing into an organization that is attuned&#13;
toenvironmental changes. You've talked in your own writingabout how the world should be and&#13;
how the IFC is going to bea very important organization and play a more important role.We want&#13;
to catch this transition and its dynamics. Thoseelements come out of the details, because you've&#13;
changed thedetails of how it runs.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, if you want to talk about the changes that tookplace in the first few years I was&#13;
here, there are a wholerange of them. The structure is one thing, and I thinkwe've, at least&#13;
sketchily, more or less covered that. Thephilosophy is another, and I think, without boasting, one&#13;
ofthe things I've done for IFC is to give them a little more ofa creative philosophy. Before I&#13;
arrived what we were andwhat we were about was rather unclear. One of the ideas thatwas&#13;
around, for example, was something called the "dualstrategy," which meant that you do some&#13;
projects to makemoney and other projects for development. I'm caricaturing alittle, but this was a&#13;
widely held view. I think it was Moeen Qureshi's view, and I decided from the very&#13;
beginningthat I didn't like it because it didn't make sense. We haveto marry profit-making with&#13;
development and insist that wepursue both objectives in all projects. That's the heart ofIFC's role,&#13;
really, to try to promote successful businesseswhich also aid development. We don't promote&#13;
development bycreating businesses that are loss-makers. It's not verydevelopmental to support a&#13;
weak company. Similarly, weshouldn't ever make an investment just to make money. Weshould&#13;
also have a development role.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Was this your idea? Did you reach this conclusion afterbeing here a few years?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: After few months, yes. Now I think that's become theaccepted credo.&#13;
&#13;
Another part of the philosophy that wasreally quite important was my push to emphasize&#13;
theactivities of the Capital Markets Department. The Bank andIFC had created the Capital&#13;
Markets Department in the â&#128;&#158;70s.It was headed by a very awkward fellow called David&#13;
Gill,brilliant but combative.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Capital Markets was our only specialist department, itdid just capital markets work, and they&#13;
were fighting witheverybody all the time. David Gill was quite convinced thathe was the&#13;
Cinderella of IFC; that he was always beingneglected and ignored. I made sure that Capital&#13;
Markets wasnot the Cinderella, but the flagship of IFC, because if youare going to promote&#13;
economic development through the privatesector there's nothing more important than creating a&#13;
market-based financial system. I immediately latched on to all thework we were doing on stock&#13;
market development and thecountry funds. David Gill was an awkward fellow but he was agreat&#13;
innovator. He did a great deal for IFC. He developedcountry funds that are traded on New York&#13;
and other advancedexchanges through which people can invest in an emergingstock market like&#13;
Korea's. This has been the biggestinnovation on the development scene in the last fifteenyears.&#13;
Gill used stock markets as a means of mobilizinglocal savings and applying them to the private&#13;
sector, and asa means of bringing in foreign investment from foreigninvestors. That's something&#13;
I'm really proud of.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Earlier, you mentioned risk assessment as a vitalquestion. When did you begin to feel that&#13;
you were gettingthe kind of information and the kind of decisions you neededon risk assessment?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I don't think I can put a date to it. It was gradual.In the year or so after I came, we&#13;
became increasingly awareof our portfolio problem, which was partly due to somedifficult&#13;
economic conditions in the world, but it was alsoan indication that some poor investment&#13;
decisions had beenmade. Jud Parmar, who was chiefly responsible for the newinvestments under&#13;
my organization, was very much aware of theproblem and took special care to deal with it,&#13;
making surethat we learned from our mistakes. Now, time will tell, butI think the record since&#13;
then is quite a lot better.Although we are having some deterioration in the portfolio right now,&#13;
it's not very serious.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Did you attempt to quantify risk assessment in theMcNamara style?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No.&#13;
&#13;
Q: It was a judgmental question?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I was thinking of the background of Vietnam, actually,where they quantified things that&#13;
couldn't be quantified.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And they got the results.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No. McNamara is a great man for whom I have the mostenormous admiration, but one&#13;
of his weaknesses was that hebelieved in statistics to the nth decimal point.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Yes.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: So you are interested in making better judgments.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. Judgment is not the same thing as a hunch. Ajudgment must be based on careful&#13;
assessment of the factsand careful investigation and careful consideration of yourexperience. We&#13;
don't want to repeat the same mistakes.However, if you went about it one way, you could say&#13;
that ahigh percentage of your projects you do in Africa fail;therefore, we shouldn't do&#13;
investments in Africa, but that'sa decision we can't take. We have to go on doing certainthings. If&#13;
we go into Africa and find ourselves doing hotelsand textiles and things that are risky, we have&#13;
to workharder at designing the projects right, making sure themanagement is right, and making&#13;
sure the markets have beeninvestigated properly. I think we've gradually improved the quality of&#13;
our decisions.&#13;
&#13;
The other big thing that happened in the early years,for which the credit really goes to Richard&#13;
Frank, was thatwe started doing our own borrowing.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Tell us a little bit about that decision.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I'd only been in IFC about three weeks when RichardFrank came to me and asked me&#13;
if I would be interested in theidea of launching a borrowing program on the market for us,for&#13;
IFC. And I thought that was a terrific idea, so westarted very modestly and built it up gradually.&#13;
We startedwith some privately placed bonds, and that grew and grew.Eventually, our operations&#13;
in this area became so significantthat we had a talk with Ernie [Ernest] Stern about it. Until then&#13;
wewere getting all our borrowed money from the Bank, and Ernie,to my delight, preferred that&#13;
we do all of our borrowingourselves with the Bank backing us. We still borrow a verysmall&#13;
amount of certain fixed-interest unusual currenciesfrom the Bank, but 95 percent or more of our&#13;
borrowing now isfrom the market and has been for a long time.&#13;
&#13;
There was a story that led to our conference with Stern.After borrowing for about three years by&#13;
private placement,people in the markets began to demand more liquidity. They wanted&#13;
tradeability, so we had to get a rating and make public issues of bonds. We got our rating in â&#128;&#159;88,&#13;
and it wasby no means a foregone conclusion that we would get a TripleA. Richard and his&#13;
people did a terrific job, and we got aTriple A from both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poors. Now&#13;
some people say, "Well, but look who your owners are. You areowned by the World Bank." We&#13;
are not owned by the WorldBank. Every one of our bonds has stamped on it, "This is notan&#13;
obligation of the World Bank." On the other hand, we arepart of the World Bank family. We are&#13;
owned by thegovernments of the world, but that doesn't mean youautomatically get a Triple A.&#13;
We are in a risk-takingbusiness. Our bond rating reflects our financial performanceand policies.&#13;
It is reviewed every year and it's a pressureon us to keep our finances in good order. I've had&#13;
very goodfinancial people here.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Are your borrowings in some way related to your equitybase?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. In fact, that was one of the policies we had toadopt. According to our Articles,&#13;
we can borrow up to fourtimes our equity base. Equity base equals subscribed capitalplus&#13;
retained earnings. We don't go that far in practice,however. The rating agency said that as a&#13;

&#13;
condition of theTriple A they wanted a limitation to 2.5 times our equitybase, and the Board&#13;
approved that. We may be going to changethat slightly in the near future, but basically that is&#13;
thething which limits our growth. We've grown very fast, butin the long run our growth is&#13;
limited by our capital and bythat factor. We could only go faster than that by puttingour Triple A&#13;
at risk, which would be crazy.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So that puts you, in a sense, pressing on the Board abit? Doesn't it?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Pressing on the Board? How?&#13;
&#13;
Q: Looking for growth in the future; that is, if they arelooking for the opportunity some place&#13;
down the line to haveyour capital increased.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, yes. But I had one great good fortune. I arrivedwith a capital increase already in&#13;
place. It had not beenformally approved by the Board of Governors, but it had beenapproved by&#13;
the Board of Directors.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Had there been resistance to that?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes, but mainly just on budgetary grounds.&#13;
&#13;
Q: It was going up to 600 million then?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No. It must have been 650, and it was doubled from 650 to1300. I also inherited a&#13;
plan--although a sketchy plan--forgrowth for the next four or five years. They were&#13;
simpleprojections, but we fulfilled that plan. By 1990, we were nolonger able to expand because&#13;
of that limitation on the twoand a half times our capital that we can borrow. Our abilityto grow&#13;
was dependent on our profitability. We could growjust as fast as we earned profits. I'm glad to&#13;
say we hadtremendously improved our profitability then, but we werestill not expecting more&#13;
than about eight percent profit,whereas for several years in the late '80s our newinvestments had&#13;
grown 20 percent. Since our profits werelower than expected, we went back to the shareholders&#13;
and had&#13;
a long fight to get another capital increase. I asked foranother doubling from 1.3 to 2.6 billion&#13;
dollars.Eventually, we got one billion, which is really what we hadin mind in the first place, but&#13;
only after a huge amount ofstalling and resistance by the U.S. Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Were you surprised that the U.S., especially after the'80s and the Reagan Administration&#13;
seemed to be opposed toexpanding an organization that was committed to developingthe private&#13;
sector?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. It was very puzzling. The Under Secretary forInternational Monetary,&#13;
International Affairs, David Mulford, determined the U.S. line on this issue because the&#13;
Secretaryof the Treasury, Nicholas Brady, didn't involve himself inthese affairs at all. Mulford&#13;
was very dominant in theTreasury, and nobody under him could take any significantdecisions.&#13;
I've never fully discovered why he held up thecapital increase. He definitely held it up for at least&#13;
&#13;

ayear. We had everybody on board except the U.S. by early1990, and they just told us flatly,&#13;
"You are going to have towait."&#13;
&#13;
Q: Even Congress was agitating for this.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: The people in the Congress were quite supportive as werepeople in other parts of the&#13;
Administration, like the StateDepartment. The Europeans were also in favor of the&#13;
capitalincrease. Why did Treasury hold us up? The ostensiblereason was that the IFC should&#13;
only get its capital when theWorld Bank, as a whole, had reformed itself on the questionof&#13;
handling the private sector. They said that they wantedIFC to be the lead organization on the&#13;
private sector, andthey wanted us to have the dialogue with governments aboutpolicies affecting&#13;
the private sector, which, of course, youcan't separate from other policies. They even wanted us&#13;
tomake it a condition of IFC investment that a governmentshould conform to what we said about&#13;
policy. We responded bysaying that we couldn't do private sector development thatway. We&#13;
believed that the Bank should maintain the dialoguewith governments. We were prepared to give&#13;
advice to theBank about what they should say, but we should not be aninstrument of&#13;
conditionality on governments.&#13;
&#13;
To make a longstory short, the IFC prevailed and got the capital increaseon its terms, although&#13;
not without a long discussion whichled to arrangements for closer collaboration between the&#13;
Bankand IFC. I must say that the Bank was extremely cooperative. Moeen Qureshi, who was&#13;
then in charge, was extremelycooperative. I've since been told by other people that themain&#13;
holdup was that David Mulford was chiefly concerned withgetting his Enterprise of the&#13;
Americas initiative through.This was his personal initiative, and it was highly political.He&#13;
believed that he really could only get one thing throughCongress at that time, and his Enterprise&#13;
initiative wasgetting priority over everything else. Even so, it's still abit of a puzzle to me, and I&#13;
don't fully understand why theTreasury behaved as it did. There's no doubt whatever thatthey&#13;
held up our capital increase for something over a year&#13;

&#13;
Q: I am Jochen Kraske, the Bank's historian.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I am William Ryrie, the Executive Vice President of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Very good. Today we'd like to follow up on some of thethings we spoke about in mid-&#13;
August. We left off talkingabout some of the reorganizations you instituted at the IFC,and the&#13;
one that we really didn't fully discuss was thereorganization of 1992, and so we'd like you to start&#13;
bytalking a little bit about that.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: It was a major reorganization. I think in some ways itwas the most radical&#13;
reorganization IFC has ever had becausebefore it took place the structure of IFC at the&#13;
workinglevel was essentially identical to that of the early days.That's to say, the bulk of the&#13;
business was done by regionaldepartments. We had eight of them which, with one&#13;
majorexception, did all kinds of business. Cement plants, oilplants, hotels--they did them all.&#13;
Capital Markets was theexception to the rule. The Capital Markets department didall of our&#13;
financial sector work worldwide. The CapitalMarkets people frequently fought with the regional&#13;
people,causing a great deal of friction.&#13;
&#13;
Shortly before the 1992 reorganization, I had set upanother small specialist unit to do corporate&#13;
financeadvisory work, mainly privatization. Eventually, however, Iconcluded that we needed to&#13;
introduce more specializationinto our work and that we needed to have multidisciplinaryunits.&#13;
We needed to team the technical people who are, bytheir nature, highly specialized, with the&#13;
financial peoplewho would be partly specialized. The financial people wouldbe devoting three or&#13;
four years of their life to getting toknow a sector, a particular type of business in some depth,thus&#13;
enabling them to establish much better working businessrelationships with the private companies&#13;
in that field. Weselected four main areas where we thought this kind ofspecialist approach would&#13;
pay off best: infrastructure(transportation, telecommunications, and power generation);oil, gas&#13;
and mining (the energy industry and the mineralmining industry); chemicals, petrochemicals and&#13;
fertilizers;and agribusiness.&#13;
&#13;
Agribusiness was a rather different kind of categorybecause the first three were all areas in&#13;
which major worldcompanies operated and there was a lot to be gained byestablishing good&#13;
connections between IFC specialists andthose companies. Knowing the companies and their&#13;
priorities,they would find quite a lot of business, not in thedeveloping countries but in London,&#13;
Houston, Tokyo or otherindustrial centers.&#13;
&#13;
Q: When would IFC normally contact one of those companies?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, I wanted to establish a good deal of continuingcontact between our organization&#13;
and private companies, so wecould learn about their investment programs and pin pointareas&#13;
where we could help. Beyond that, we contacted them atvarious stages in their programs, from&#13;
feasibility studiesright through to the investment decision.&#13;
&#13;
Agribusiness was a rather different case. It's a casewhere we felt that our record was rather bad.&#13;
We'd made manyinvestments that lost a lot of money, yet it wasdevelopmentally very important.&#13;
We couldn't possibly ignoreit. We had to learn how to do it better. We just thoughtwe'd set up a&#13;
group and say, "Let's see how it goes." It hasbeen a spectacular success. I can't say that for&#13;
certaintyin terms of profit yet, but I believe the profits will come.Vertical integration is very&#13;
important. We make sure thatthe people who grew things were well and closely connectedwith&#13;
the people who sold them. We always pay a lot ofattention to the growing end, but we usually&#13;
finance thecompanies who buy the growers' products, very oftenprocessing and selling them.&#13;
&#13;
Specialization was one of the main objectives of thereorganization, but I had another objective as&#13;
well. I feltthat we could establish better strategies for each region. Alongside our new specialistsâ&#128;&#159;&#13;
departments, we reduced thenumber of regional departments to five, Latin America,&#13;
Europe(including Russia, etcetera), the Middle East (including CentralAsia), Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa, and the rest of Asia. Thosedepartments now do all the business that is not reserved&#13;
forspecialists' departments. They do a lot of investment ingeneral manufacturing, but they also&#13;
try to formulate ouroverall approach to those areas and share their ideas withthe specialists'&#13;
departments.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Can I ask you a question about that phase?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q: When you went from eight to five, that also gave you anopportunity to change some people&#13;
around and do some otherthings. Was that an aspect of this?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. It had certain advantages. I got a departmentcovering the whole of sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa where I think theissues are unique. It also enabled us to diversify theethnic backgrounds&#13;
of our staff. I regret to say we had fartoo many of our African staff members working with&#13;
Africa. Itwas very difficult to shift them into Europe or Latin Americaunder the old system. The&#13;
reorganization allowed us to shiftthem into oil, gas and mining, or infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
The reorganization also helped to lessen the frictionbetween Capital Markets and the regional&#13;
people. I broke upthe Capital Markets department and regionalized it. Thatmove went against the&#13;
general trend of the reorganization,but it was just what we needed. Capital markets work is&#13;
veryspecific to each country and region. The way you handle itin Africa is quite different from&#13;
Asia, etcetera. Recognizingthis, I put a capital markets division under each regionaldirector. We&#13;
didn't stop there, however. We appointed avice president to supervise the whole capital&#13;
marketsactivity worldwide. His job was to make sure that we didn'tlose our capital markets focus&#13;
and expertise. I think thatthis system of matrix reporting is working well. There hascertainly&#13;
been a surge of energy in the Corporation. I oftenthink that I should have done this a bit sooner,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
but in theyears preceding 1992 I was very worried about the capitalincrease, and I didn't really&#13;
think it was appropriate tolaunch a big reorganization until we had our capitalapproved.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Could you talk a bit about the relationship between theIFC, other investment banks, and the&#13;
World Bank itself? Howdoes the IFC become, compete with these other institutions,and where&#13;
do you see a greater cooperation?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Clearly, we have to work closely with the World Bank.Our roles are complementary.&#13;
There is a little overlap hereand there (in the capital markets field and financialinstitutions and so&#13;
on), but generally the roles aredistinguishable. Perhaps in the past we've been a bit tooseparate.&#13;
Nowadays, the Board is very eager to see IFCcooperate with the Bank. They want us, IFC, to&#13;
ensure thatour investments conform to Bank strategies.That isn't alwaysa realistic goal because&#13;
we can't plan in quite the same wayas the Bank can. The Bank works with governments, and&#13;
wework with private sector partners when we can find them.&#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, we have taken a lot of steps forward inconsultation. There is, I think, much more&#13;
consultation nowat the working level. For example, over the last two yearswe've been working&#13;
with the Bank on Private SectorAssessments, or PSAs. These documents review the conditionof&#13;
the private sector in certain countries and the policiesthat affect it. From those analyses, PSAs&#13;
enable us to drawconclusions about what the Bank and IFC's priorities shouldbe. I think that&#13;
effort has progressed fairly well. Ofcourse, all forms of cooperation depend on the attitudes&#13;
ofindividual people. Some are positive and some are not sopositive, but I think we've made some&#13;
progress incooperation.&#13;
&#13;
Now, cooperation with other institutions. .&#13;
&#13;
Q: Can we just stop on the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Do you think that the IFC's emphasis on privatizationand markets represents a break with&#13;
the Bank's traditions? If privatization and markets are the wave of the future, then in a certain&#13;
sense it seems to me that you arebreaking away historically from the roots of the Bank, and its&#13;
basic ideology.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: It's a very important change in the whole developmentbusiness, but I'm not quite sure&#13;
that I would describe it asa break with the Bank. For the last decade or so, the worldhas been&#13;
moving towards the market philosophy, and the Bankhas been played a major role in that&#13;
process. It hasstrongly encouraged governments to follow the sort ofpolicies that allow market&#13;
forces to work.&#13;
&#13;
Now, that clearly raises some questions about the natureof the international development effort. I&#13;
would say that itclearly calls for reducing the emphasis on official lendingto governments and&#13;
increasing the emphasis on the kind ofactivities which support market-based solutions. There&#13;
oughtto be a relative reduction in Bank-type activity and arelative increase in our type of activity.&#13;
Furthermore, Iwould still say that, although we've expanded very stronglyover the last nine or&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ten years, the proportions aren't rightyet. I think the Bank's training activities should besomewhat&#13;
reduced and ours should be somewhat increased.&#13;
&#13;
However, I do not mean to imply that we should displace theBank or take over their functions.&#13;
The Bank's work istremendously important and tremendously needed. It's amatter of the relative&#13;
scale of things. Although IFC hasgrown enormously, we are currently experiencing a demand&#13;
forour services and for our financial resources which vastlyexceeds what we can supply. I don't&#13;
think that's true of theBank.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Do you see the Bank meeting some of this demand?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, that's an idea that's being discussed from time totime. People have suggested&#13;
that the Bank change itsArticles of Agreement so that can lend directly to theprivate sector, but&#13;
where does that logic take you? If youare going to do the sort of things that IFC does, you have&#13;
toconform to certain principles: functioning like a business(on a bottom-line oriented basis, so&#13;
that you share the samerisks as the people you are investing with), making goodbusiness&#13;
decisions, being a catalyst, and all those things.Well, if you were to use some of the Bank's&#13;
resources tosupport the private sector, I think you should apply the sameprinciples, and if you&#13;
did that in the Bank, you'd simply becreating a duplicate of IFC. What's the point of that?&#13;
Itwould be better to enlarge IFC at a reasonable rate. IFCis, at the moment, considerably&#13;
constrained in what it can doby the amount of capital it has. We keep thinking about waysin&#13;
which we can increase our growth without asking theshareholders for more capital. Some have&#13;
suggested that theBank transfer some of its capital to IFC.&#13;
&#13;
Although a transfer of capital from the Bank to IFCseems like a good idea, it does have its&#13;
problems. TheBank's own capital generally doesn't consist of money but ofguarantees, or&#13;
callable capital. Our capital is cash. Andthe way we work is that we leverage that capital up to a&#13;
rateof two and a half times our equity. Now, one of the questions we are still reviewing is&#13;
whether we can't relax that limit a bit and give ourselves a bit more headroom while not&#13;
endangering our Triple A rating. My successor will haveto consider this and other exciting&#13;
questions about how IFCcan maximize its impact with limited resources.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And those other institutions. .&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, there are the other multilateral banks, and theone with which we have by far the&#13;
most contact andcooperation is the European Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment which&#13;
was established only two and a half yearsago. They have pretty much the same mandate as we&#13;
do. Whenthe Communist regimes collapsed in Europe, it was obviouslynecessary to do&#13;
something new, and the choice essentially wasbetween additional funding for the World Bank&#13;
and IFC or anew institution, so (for political reasons, largely) they wentfor a new institution.&#13;
This does mean that we and the EBRDare doing the same kind of job, but it works. We&#13;
exchangeinformation freely. They know everything we do. I think weknow about everything&#13;
they are doing. Furthermore, we veryoften work together on big projects where it's difficult to&#13;
raise money.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Such as . . .&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Such as the one that just collapsed. The Volkswagenproject. Volkswagen walked out&#13;
of the signing ceremonyyesterday. That was extraordinary. That was the biggestproject we had&#13;
ever approved, and now it's in pieces.&#13;
&#13;
Q: This was in Czechoslovakia?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: In Skoda, in the Czech Republic. We and the EBRD werejointly going to lend (and&#13;
mobilize from banks) a total of DM [Deutsche mark]1.4 billion. It made sense for us to work&#13;
with the EBRD on aproject of this magnitude, but on smaller projects itdoesn't make sense for us&#13;
both to be in there. The clientschoose their financing partners, and we just need to make surethat&#13;
we are not competing on terms. It would be very bad,and very unseemly, if we were trying to get&#13;
the business byoffering lower interest rates or something. I think we canbe quite sure that's not&#13;
happening. Nevertheless, I don'tthink a little rivalry between us necessarily does any harm.We&#13;
don't have very much contact with the other regionalbanks (the Latin American, the African, the&#13;
Asian), butoccasionally we do a bit of co-financing.&#13;
&#13;
You meant the multilateral banks? You are not speakingabout private institutions?&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, that was something we wanted to ask about as well.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, people sometimes wonder if we are competing withinvestment banks. To be&#13;
sure, we are a kind of investmentbank. We do a lot of investment banking sort of work.However,&#13;
in most of our project financing, the issue doesn'tarise.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Will you tell me why is doesn't arise?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, no one else does exactly what we do: puttingprojects together and raising&#13;
money for them. We oftencooperate with commercial banks by bringing them into theseprojects,&#13;
but they come in because we bring them in. Theyare not anxious to take the lead role. They&#13;
believe theirrisks are reduced by coming in with us. We have this B-Loansystem, which is&#13;
lending through IFC.&#13;
&#13;
I don't think any major investment banks have complainedthat we compete in their field. Some&#13;
of them say that wecompete over privatization. We have a small unit that doessome privatization&#13;
work for fees, but we always make sure tocharge market fees. We don't try to get the business&#13;
byundercutting the merchant banks or investment banks. Infact, we do very little privatization&#13;
work. We have a unitthat consists of about twenty people, and the amount ofbusiness they are&#13;
doing worldwide is not undermining anybody.It's generally in cases where the government&#13;
clearly wants aninternational body like us to be there because they think weare more objective or&#13;
something. There was some noise aboutthis a couple of years ago, but I haven't heard much&#13;
lately.I don't think it's a serious problem.&#13;
&#13;
The other area where we sometimes compete is thebusiness of underwriting issues of securities&#13;
by companies inthe developing world. We firmly believe in encouraging thedeveloping country&#13;
companies to go to the major markets andissue stock or debt securities, and we are prepared to&#13;
dosome underwriting in those cases. Now, this has become quitea big business in certain parts of&#13;

the world. The Morgan Stanleys, Salomons, Rothschilds and so on are all lookingfor that kind of&#13;
business in Mexico, Chile and some othercountries like Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. As&#13;
forIFC, we do a small amount of it. We have a deep knowledge ofthose countries, and we have a&#13;
lot of contacts with companieswho might not otherwise go to the international markets. Ifwe do&#13;
this, we always do it jointly with a private investmentbank, although we always insist on being&#13;
one of the jointleaders. However, last year we did about six of these, sothe scale of this activity is&#13;
not a threat to the merchantbankers.&#13;
&#13;
Q: If you had an interest in places like Latin America, whyisn't IFC working jointly with the&#13;
Latin American DevelopmentBank?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, the IADB [Inter-American Development Bank] works with governments, not&#13;
the privatesector.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Oh, I see.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: It's very much like the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Like the Bank itself.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. For quite a number of years, Latin America hasbeen our biggest area of&#13;
investments. Now we're reducing ourexposure there. The reason for that was quite clear.&#13;
Duringthe years of the debt crisis, there was almost no access forprivate companies to foreign&#13;
exchange capital. We were oneof the very few sources of it. As a result, we were mostlylending,&#13;
not to foreign investors, but to local companies.Despite all the problems in Latin America and all&#13;
the debtand inflation and all that, there were a lot of goodcompanies there. The paradox was that&#13;
with all the apparentmess in Latin America, we had a strong portfolio whichperformed very well.&#13;
We had very few problems.&#13;
&#13;
Recently, the story has been changing. Latin Americancountries (and companies in several of the&#13;
countries) aregetting access to capital markets. Chile is very much in thelead in this respect.&#13;
Chile is now investment-grade, and weare not much needed there. Our role as a financier&#13;
isexpiring because they can find money themselves. ThroughoutSouth America, companies are&#13;
realizing that they can go tothe international markets. The stronger ones can, and we aretrying to&#13;
help the ones that can't. Nowadays, our main rolein Latin America is facilitating companies'&#13;
access to capitalmarkets.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Are private banks being more careful this time aroundthan before the debt crisis? Of course,&#13;
they lent to thepublic sector.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: They lend to the public sector, yes. This is privatesector risk, yet they are still rather&#13;
cautious. Forexample, we are doing quite a lot of syndicated loans inArgentina this year, and,&#13;
once they get over a few hundredmillion, it becomes a little difficult to persuade the banksto stay&#13;
on board. They have limits. Open access is not areality yet.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I suppose there is also a question about the size ofprojects. I assume that the IFC and the&#13;

&#13;
investment/commercial banks both prefer to do the largertypes of projects. However, I would&#13;
also assume that IFC'srole as a development institution compels it to look atrelatively small&#13;
projects, particularly in Africa. How doyou view this issue?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, it doesn't really seem to work out that way. Onthe big projects, when we are in&#13;
there, it's nearly alwaysbecause there's a real problem in raising the debt finance.&#13;
&#13;
One of the very big projects we did in my early days in IFCwas a huge copper investment,&#13;
Escondido, in Chile. It hadthe finest copper ore in the world, four percent copper ore,but Chile&#13;
was regarded as rather risky in those days (1986).Chile needed a huge amount of capital,&#13;
something like $1.2billion, and they just could not put it together unless wewere in there&#13;
mobilizing some banks. We had very little tocontribute on the technology or any of that. It&#13;
wasprimarily a loan finance raising operation, although we didtake a small equity stake as well.&#13;
We were hesitant atfirst because we didn't know what was going to happen to theprice of copper,&#13;
but it shot up just after we made theinvestments. That was very good.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Your comments made me think of a question of the profitperformance. In any of the&#13;
reorganizations did you changethe way people were evaluated?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: In 1987 we did introduce a system of profit centers, sothe performance of the&#13;
investment departments and theirdirectors and other managers is judged partly (not wholly)in&#13;
relation to how they perform on the profit objective.&#13;
&#13;
Now, you may ask, what is the profit objective? You have tobe very careful about answering that&#13;
question. Making moneyin Latin America is relatively easy nowadays while makingmoney in&#13;
Africa is pretty difficult. In other words, we hadto set realistic objectives and then judge them by&#13;
how fullythey achieve them. Profit is not our ultimate objective.It's something else. It's called&#13;
"Development."&#13;
&#13;
Q: It's a constrained profit evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes, but we reorganized ourselves to make the mainoperational departments profit&#13;
centers. Now we have tenoperational departments now--five specialist, five regional--and they&#13;
are all profit centers. They are responsible fortheir own bottom lines, which means, also, that&#13;
they have tolook after the portfolio of investments in their area. Webelieve that the people who&#13;
make the investments should livewith them, although it doesn't always work because very often&#13;
if things go wrong in a project, it's five years later andthe staff concerned has moved somewhere&#13;
else.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Is there greater movement within the IFC, among thestaff and personnel, than at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I think probably not. I think this has been one of ourweaknesses. We are correcting it&#13;
now, but there is aconsiderable lack of movement. I talked about the Africansgetting stuck in&#13;
Africa. In some ways, this is a reflectionof the personnel systems and policies that apply both in&#13;
theBank and IFC. There's a great deal of what I call"voluntarism," people are moved as a result&#13;
of negotiationbetween themselves and their managers. They go and see thehead of some other&#13;

unit and say, "Can I move to you?" Thereisn't central management and control of personnel&#13;
movement.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has a bit more of it. They are a bit moresystematic about it. They plan people's careers&#13;
better. Ibrought in a new personnel director recently, and we'vestarted to do this more&#13;
systematically in IFC, but I think ithas been something of a weakness with us in the past.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So what you'd like to see, then, is rotation system likea private corporation would normally&#13;
have.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Precisely. We've introduced a new system of rotation.Every summer some people are&#13;
moved with career developmentin mind, but also the benefit of the Corporation. It's kindof&#13;
difficult to make it work because you have to get theright balance between central initiative and&#13;
consent. Youcan't just order people about in these institutions as ifthey were soldiers in the army.&#13;
&#13;
Q: People don't see this, though, as a career enhancingmove? Because in private sector&#13;
corporations in the UnitedStates people welcome the kind of moving around because it'sa sign&#13;
that the upper levels of management see them as havingpotential.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: I think there's quite a difference between the youngerpeople and the older people. I&#13;
think the younger people dosee it that way, and the older people are a little moreconservative.&#13;
We did the first rotation this summer, and itseemed to go quite well.&#13;
&#13;
Q: While we are on the question of personnel, where are youdrawing your new people from?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: That's a good question. It's a question of someimportance for us because we are&#13;
expanding fast and we haveto recruit a lot, and I'm worried about the fact that we arerecruiting&#13;
predominantly very young people. Now, we do get avery bright sort of person in IFC, and the&#13;
World Bank, too.Certainly IFC attracts highly able people with a high degreeof dedication, and&#13;
I'm struck by the sharpness of some ofthese young, these 30 to 32 year-olds who come in.&#13;
However,when you look at the figures, you realize that an alarmingproportion of the staff of an&#13;
investment department have beenthere one year or two years. They are bright butinexperienced.&#13;
If we are going to continue to bring in stafffrom the outside, we must have a proportion of those&#13;
staffmore experienced. Some come to us from the Bank. IFC may bereluctant to admit it, but&#13;
many of our best people have comefrom the Bank. There are also some Bank people who find&#13;
thetransition to IFC unacceptable, but there are always acertain number who do come and who&#13;
do very well. Lookingforward rather than back, we've been trying to institute somesystems for&#13;
bringing in a certain number of 40-year-olds.The trouble is that while we are very competitive in&#13;
payterms at age 30, we are not so competitive at age 40, butthat isn't the real obstacle. I think the&#13;
real obstacle isthat managers are very suspicious of the more experiencedpeople. They think they&#13;
can't control them so well.&#13;
&#13;
Q: They are probably right.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: They can't mold them into the way of the institution.Well, I think the institution&#13;
suffers from not getting asmall admixture of experienced people from elsewhere. Ithink we've&#13;
got to try and improve that.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Has there been a change in the makeup by nationality ofthe people that you've attracted over&#13;
the last five or sixyears?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No. Not much. There are certain persistent problems inthat area. We have areas of the&#13;
world from which it's verydifficult to recruit. Japan is an obvious one. LatinAmerica used to be&#13;
less of a problem. When Latin America wasfull of military dictators, the intelligent people ran&#13;
awayand came to the World Bank and to IFC. The outbreak ofdemocracy in Latin America has&#13;
been disastrous forrecruitment. We have quite a number of Europeans, but notenough--probably&#13;
because the exchange rate makes the dollarsalary look weaker than it really is. Sometimes people&#13;
saythat the reputation of Washington as the murder center of theworld discourages some people.&#13;
We get lots of Americans,British, Indians, Filipinos, Pakistanis and others.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, with the shrinking of firms on Wall Street theremust have been a lot of people looking&#13;
for work.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes, but, we have to be careful. When that kind ofthing happens, it's the weaker&#13;
brethren who leave. I get twoletters a day across my desk asking for jobs, but we don'ttake very&#13;
many of them.&#13;
&#13;
Q: If I may just back up a little to the point of IFC'srelationship with the World Bank. One of&#13;
the questions wewere trying to get at earlier was what influence the IFC andits interest in&#13;
privatization has had on the Bank.Specifically, we wanted to ask about was the [Fred] Levy&#13;
Report of&#13;
1988 or '89.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, that wasn't so much about privatization. It wasabout financial sector&#13;
development. We thought that was agood report. It was about trying to make development&#13;
effortsconform to the market philosophy as much as possible. Thereport hasn't always been&#13;
followed. There are cases, whichIFC is well aware of, of Bank money being lent&#13;
withoutexchange risk at rates of interest well below the rate ofinflation in some countries, which&#13;
is not consistent withLevy.&#13;
&#13;
While the Levy Report was being prepared, however,there was a big discussion going on&#13;
connected with ourcapital increase, and the U.S., who was resisting the capitalincrease, was&#13;
asking for much closer cooperation between theIFC and the Bank. In some ways, they were&#13;
asking IFC to playa role which we didn't think we could play. They wanted usto take the lead in&#13;
all private sector development projects.Neither we nor the Bank thought that that made a lot&#13;
ofsense, but it did lead to some guidelines about how we couldcooperate in that field of financial&#13;
sector development.There is now a rule--which I think still works in practice--that whenever&#13;
either institution makes a loan to a financialinstitution (a bank or something) the other institution&#13;
hasto be consulted.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Q: An issue that obviously has been very important to theWorld Bank in recent years is the&#13;
whole series of issuesrelating to the environment. How has that affected the IFC?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: We've become much more conscious of this. We genuinelyhave. In our case, the main&#13;
thing is to make sure that allprojects are rigorously examined to minimize any&#13;
adverseenvironmental impact. We have a set of procedures which aresomewhat different just&#13;
because we are dealing with privatesector companies. That's really the only reason for there tobe&#13;
any difference. The Board has been a little suspicious ofthis because they tend to think that we&#13;
are trying to escapeall environmental pressures, which is absolute nonsense. Ithink most IFC&#13;
people are extremely keen to use our influenceas much as possible and get our client companies&#13;
to adopthigh environmental standards. We set out some rather simpleprocedures for this. They&#13;
were very clear and concise, butthey didn't satisfy the Board. As the Board complained aboutour&#13;
procedures, I realized that what the Board wanted,frankly, was verbiage. They wanted something&#13;
not five pageslong but fifty pages long with all sorts of grand principlesand so on. So we now&#13;
have a 50-page document which, I think,will be far less practically useful than the one we&#13;
hadbefore. Still, it's certainly something we have to pay a lotof attention to now, and we do.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Do you think that the IFC may avoid projects involvingdifficult environmental issues&#13;
because the procedures are socumbersome and difficult?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. I think you are hitting an important point, notonly because the procedures are&#13;
cumbersome but because of therisk that we are going to be attacked. We do projects wherewe&#13;
think we are making a positive contribution. There was ahydroelectric project in Chile, where we&#13;
supported thisproject which involved damming a small part of a river whichwas famous for&#13;
white water rafting, and NGOs [non-governmental organizations] from all aroundthe world&#13;
attacked us. Meanwhile, the Board was quiteconvinced that our intervention was doing a great&#13;
deal ofenvironmental good. We only had to move 53 people from alocal tribe, and they were&#13;
delighted, of course. We gave thetribe new housing elsewhere. We persuaded the firm that&#13;
wasbuilding this dam to set up a foundation to preserve theculture of this tribe. We did all sorts&#13;
of things. Chileneeded power very, very badly, and this was the leastenvironmentally damaging&#13;
way of doing it. Nevertheless, Isometimes wonder if it might have been easier for us just tohave&#13;
left the thing alone. This is a very, very importantsubject, and I take environmental risks very&#13;
seriously, but wedo deal with some fairly crazy people in that field.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Have your encountered any environmental resistance fromyour clients or sponsor&#13;
companies?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Some, but on the whole I would say that, to asurprising extent, they accept the need to&#13;
achieve highenvironmental standards. I suppose people really dounderstand that if they are going&#13;
to deal with a unit of theWorld Bank, they are going to have to meet these standards.&#13;
&#13;
Q: It is a particularly difficult issue, because it oftenappears that it's anti-development, anti-&#13;
growth.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Q: And then you've got the struggle between countries thatneed the growth and those that have&#13;
the money.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. It tends to degenerate into a Part I/Part II kindof thing, where NGOs in this&#13;
country and some from certaincountries in Europe follow what we do very, very closely,and very&#13;
suspiciously. However, our procedures require us toconsult the NGOs in the country concerned&#13;
and that reallyought to be the main thing, shouldn't it?&#13;
&#13;
Q: You don't conduct any of these environmental studies.You accept or approve the companies'&#13;
studies or work withthem to get the right studies?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Work with them to get the right study is the way to putit. We have a little group of&#13;
specialists here, theEnvironmental Unit, and they categorize projects. Category Ais for those&#13;
with significant environmental risks. B is forthose with minor environmental issues. And C is for&#13;
thosewith no environmental issues. We are really concerned mainlywith Category A. In the case&#13;
of Category A, there has to bean environmental assessment, which is arranged andcommissioned&#13;
by the sponsor company but with our agreement.It's usually done by a consultant of whom we&#13;
approve, and ithas to be done speedily. The results must be made availableto NGOs in the&#13;
country concerned.&#13;
&#13;
Q: The last time we talked, you discussed public relationsa bit. This is an area where public&#13;
relations are involved.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. I think we, the Bank group, are getting the wrongend of the stick on this for&#13;
reasons I don't totallyunderstand. There is a high degree of suspicion. They won'taccept that we&#13;
are actually trying to achieve these highenvironmental standards, which I believe we are.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Are you satisfied with the public relations effortthat's being made?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: In the environmental field? You are not speaking aboutpublic relations in general.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No. I can't say I am satisfied. I don't think we'veresolved this problem yet. I think we&#13;
are still getting abad press on this subject. That dam in Chile was, in myopinion, a first-class&#13;
project from an environmental point ofview, yet the NGO papers still refer to it as a&#13;
dreadfulthing.&#13;
&#13;
Q: We'd like to talk about some current issues, currentgoals, and future goals. How do you see&#13;
the IFC coping withthe increasing demands of Eastern Europe, Africa, and LatinAmerica for&#13;
private sector development while facing the lowerprofitability from the sluggish international&#13;
economy?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, the sluggish international economy I hope is ashort-term phenomenon. I mean,&#13;
the U.S. economy was prettysluggish 18 months ago and is now doing reasonably well.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Europe, on the other hand, may take a little longer to comeout of it, but we have to think about&#13;
these things in arather long-term context.&#13;
&#13;
The big issue here is the adequacyof IFC's resources. We are investing a little over twobillion&#13;
dollars a year now, in 165-170 projects. From onepoint of view, that's quite a lot of money.&#13;
However, if youlook at the needs of the world, it's rather minuscule. We'retrying to get the&#13;
private sector to finance most of theseneeds. We want to be involved only in those cases where&#13;
ourpresence makes the difference, and that's got to be anarrower category.&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructure is a good example. Adecade ago, all this investment (power generation,&#13;
telecoms,transport) was done by governments, and now governmentseverywhere are looking for&#13;
private finance to do it, (a)because they are short of money, and (b) because many of themat least&#13;
believe the private sector will do it moreefficiently. The switch to private financing&#13;
ininfrastructure has been very marked. Now, somebody hasestimated (I think this is a Bank&#13;
estimate) that between nowand 2000 the demand for infrastructure investment in thedeveloping&#13;
and ex-Communist countries will be about $200billion a year. Some of that will come from the&#13;
public sector; some will come from the private sector. IFC is currently investing about $500&#13;
million. Of course, we are acatalyst and our share of those investments would be probablyunder&#13;
ten percent, so we may be talking about $5 billion orsomething, but still, the question is whether&#13;
we aresucceeding in dealing with all the projects where ourpresence really would make the&#13;
difference. I think it'sreasonable to assume that we are meeting far less than theneed. The&#13;
evidence supports this conclusion because we aregetting far more demand than we can meet. In&#13;
an ideal worldwhere there are no budgetary problems and so on, there wouldbe a case for quite a&#13;
lot more capital for IFC, but thatisn't going to happen.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I tried this on Jochen earlier and I didn't get anyresponse at all from him, but some of my&#13;
very conservativefriends--and I have some very conservative friends--say thereis a rule of two.&#13;
Have you ever heard that expression?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: A rule of two?&#13;
&#13;
Q: A rule of two. That every public venture costs twice asmuch as any comparable private&#13;
venture? You don't use therule of two, then?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No, but the principle is familiar.&#13;
&#13;
Q: He claims that this was based on some, some World Bank Group studies, but. .&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: It may well be.&#13;
&#13;
Q: but I don't know. I can't find anything about this sofar.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I would suggest that the study was probably done by theHeritage Foundation or the Cato&#13;
Institute.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Cato, right. I probably would have said Cato.&#13;

&#13;
Q: What area do you see as having the most potential forIFC to have a positive impact?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: What area geographically?&#13;
&#13;
Q: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, regionally I would have thought there werecountries in all the regions where we&#13;
can make a significantimpact, but the reasons for that vary quite a lot from onearea to another.&#13;
We know many, many countries in differentregions where, for whatever reason (some&#13;
inadequacy ofgovernment policy), there is a lack of long-term capital. Thecapital markets are not&#13;
providing the long-term finance onreasonable terms that the private sector needs.&#13;
&#13;
Now, you canthink of some areas where the capital markets are beginningto do so, but the need&#13;
still greatly exceeds the supply. I'mthinking of the up and coming countries of Asia,&#13;
likeIndonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and so on. However, questionsare now beginning to arise&#13;
about our role there. Thosecountries, as they continue to make progress, will becomelike Korea&#13;
and Taiwan where our role is finished. If youlook at Latin America, the role is pretty well&#13;
complete inChile because the government's policies have been veryfriendly to markets.&#13;
&#13;
Markets don't work perfectly, however.Although there are places where things are going quite&#13;
wellin some respects, there is still a lot of poverty around.Even in the richer countries of Asia&#13;
and Latin America, thereare a great many pockets where we are needed. When you lookat&#13;
Africa, of course, you have a quite different story. It'sjust desperately difficult to get any&#13;
investment going atall, and we have different methods there. No one ever hasany problems with&#13;
our role in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
In the former communist countries, we are trying to helpthe process of transition to a market&#13;
economy. There, I seeour role as one of being a complement to the IMF, which isdealing with it&#13;
mainly at a certain level, and the WorldBank, which is dealing with it at a sectoral level. As&#13;
forIFC, we usually deal with it at a very institutional,transactional level. We try to get individual&#13;
companies orbanks or whatever to function effectively.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What particular problems have you had? Do you get thekind of entrepreneurial response in&#13;
Eastern Europe that youare looking for to support private ventures, or are youlooking for outside&#13;
companies to move in?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: In Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, you cancertainly find the entrepreneurial&#13;
response.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Hungarians have always been like that.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Actually the Poles are really very like that, and the Polish economy is now over fifty&#13;
percent private sector. Lots of new businesses have been springing up. However, theother&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
countries of Central Europe (Rumania, Bulgaria and soon) have just been much more difficult,&#13;
but I don't think onecan say that this is due to a lack of entrepreneurs. It'sbecause the&#13;
governments have not been reforming in the sameway. Russia is another story, and again I think&#13;
ourproblems there don't arise because we can't findentrepreneurs but because of the country's&#13;
general economicconditions.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What about Russia's monetary problems?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: They are a factor, but they are closely linked topolitical conditions, the lack of a stable&#13;
government tocontrol the money supply and run a proper budget and so on.In the case of Russia,&#13;
we think we've achieved a great dealby getting privatization going. Mr. [Yegor] Gaidar, who's&#13;
just beenbrought back into the cabinet, was heard to say at a recentmeeting that IFC had more&#13;
impact on Russia than any otherinternational organization. A little bit of boasting, butthe reason&#13;
for that is that IFC, funded by the U.S. and someother donors, went in and did a lot of technical&#13;
assistance.It was not a matter of writing reports and sending them backto Washington; it was just&#13;
getting on with making thingswork on the ground. Our people devised a system for theauctioning&#13;
of small businesses, shops and restaurants, in thecity of Nizhny Novgorod, the third largest city&#13;
in Russia.This system became a model for the rest of Russia, and wewrote a manual and&#13;
distributed 45,000 copies. This hasbecome the system by which all small businesses&#13;
areprivatized in Russia now.&#13;
&#13;
From small businesses, we moved on to help with theauctioning off of major companies through&#13;
their vouchersystem. We did not invent the voucher system. That wastheir idea. In addition, we&#13;
are now experimenting with someland privatization in the same area of Nizhny Novgorod, inthe&#13;
hope that once again it will become a model. This Ithink is one way you can have a big impact&#13;
on Russia. Russiais so varied, so huge, that everything depends on what it'slike in one region or&#13;
another. Nizhny Novgorod has become acenter of our operations because it has a highly reform-&#13;
minded governor and mayor. You can do things in one oblast,but you can't do them in the oblast&#13;
next door, so you try tocreate islands of success here and there. The operations inRussia have&#13;
been very exciting. It's all very unlike likeIFC's regular agenda. It represented a break with&#13;
ourprevious activities--lending, financing, and investing.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Has IFC been involved in privatizing any of the largestate enterprises in these countries?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: We've taken on some specific privatizations, yes. Weprivatized the cement sector in&#13;
Poland and a number ofbanks, hotels and things like that. There's a big industrialcomplex called&#13;
Skoda Plzen, an engineering complex in theCzech Republic which sold exports to the former&#13;
Soviet Union.They invited us in, and we collected a group of consultantsand drew up a plan for&#13;
the disposal of this large firm. Idon't think the plan was really effectively followed&#13;
throughbecause Siemens of Germany was supposed to buy the main partof the complex but they&#13;
backed out after pondering it for ayear. In summary, we have privatized a few large&#13;
stateenterprises, but our effort was by no means comprehensive.&#13;
&#13;
Q: As the World Bank became more involved in particularregions of the world, it became more&#13;
and more involved in theprocess of economic development. Do you feel that the IFChas&#13;
exhibited (or will exhibit) this same tendency?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Clearly, the transition to a market economy requiresmajor macroeconomic measures,&#13;
which is not our business, butthey are absolutely vital. Poland, for example, took them inone big&#13;
step (Balcerorvius on the first of January 1990),and it created the right conditions for markets to&#13;
begin towork. Those are the things which you can do quickly ifyou've got the political courage&#13;
and power. Changing thestructure of industry, you can do only rather slowly.&#13;
&#13;
Q: There's also the question of high unemployment thatcomes with a lot of the restructuring.&#13;
Does IFC ever getinto any of that?&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: No. I happen to think that most of that unemploymentwill probably be absorbed by&#13;
new business and not by thereform of the old businesses. I think a lot of those olddinosaurs will&#13;
die. That's probably true in Russia, too, butit will be a very slow process.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Finally, we'd like to turn to some larger, one or twolarger questions about what you see as&#13;
the qualities andskills that are needed to be an effective leader of the WorldBank.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: To be the head of the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
Q: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Yes. To be head of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Well, I don't think he or she really needs to be abanker. Clearly, Bob McNamara was&#13;
not a banker. I don'tthink it really is a banking job, although there are bankingaspects to it. I&#13;
think it's a highly political job. In myview, the best head of the World Bank is a rather good&#13;
publicfigure who is at ease with Presidents and Prime Ministersand can tell them where to get off&#13;
if necessaryâ&#128;&#148;somebodywho's rather strong and confident.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Isn't it more the vision thing that is important? Imean, certainly if you look at McNamara,&#13;
that was hisstrength. Clausen and Preston presumably had a lot ofmanagerial experience, but&#13;
they had very little involvementwith development issues as such and therefore could notmotivate&#13;
their staffs.&#13;
&#13;
RYRIE: Yes. I fully agree. I didn't mean to exclude that.The President of the Bank also has to&#13;
be a leader in thinkingabout development--someone who creates a vision, not only forthe Bank&#13;
itself but for the countries who support the Bank.I would like to see a new head of the Bank who&#13;
is 50 yearsold and really vigorous and able to do some serious axingand re-direct the&#13;
organization. I think there's a realchallenge there for somebody to do something about it.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Thank you very much.&#13;

            On August 10 and September 17 1993,
            William S. Ryrie was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank
            Group Archives oral history program by William Becker, Louis
            Galambos, and Jochen Kraske. During his tenure at the Bank
            from 1975 to 1994, Mr. Ryrie worked in the following areas:
            in the United Kingdom as executive director (1975-1980); for
            the International Finance Corporation (IFC) as executive
            vice president (1984-1994); and as a member for the policy
            committee (1984-1994). He discusses diversifying the ethnic
            backgrounds of the World Bank staff, assessing environmental
            risks in countries like Chile, and reducing the number of
            regional departments to Latin America, Europe, the Middle
            East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. His transcript also
            concerns the reorganization of the World Bank in 1992.
