FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report. The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family  planning  programs.    They  include   several  country and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis and research, and on reports of other organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.       The&#13;
papers   are   the  work   of   individuals   and  the   views   and&#13;
interpretations express~ed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and development issues among students and practitioners of&#13;
development.&#13;

Editor's Introduction&#13;
Measuring the impact of family planning programs on fertility is&#13;
less straightforward than it seems. To distinguish the specific impact of&#13;
a program, analysts must estimate how fertility would have changed in its&#13;
absence. That requires systematically eliminating other possible causes of&#13;
a country's fertility decline--such as increases in income, education, and&#13;
life expectancy in the same period. In addition, information on the change&#13;
in the availability and quality of family planning information and services&#13;
is needed (not on change in the use of services, since use is related to&#13;
people's fertility goals and does not indicate the difference services&#13;
alone would make to people who now have no access to them). Throughout&#13;
much of the 1960s and 1970s, such information has been of poor quality or&#13;
not available at all.&#13;
Given the analytical difficulties and the lack of good&#13;
information, it was not surprising that a decade ago policymakers and&#13;
planners could not completely agree on the relative importance to a&#13;
fertility decline of the supply of family planning services versus the&#13;
"demand" factors--increasing education, lower infant mortality, and the&#13;
like. Early family planning programs in Korea, Hong Kong, and other areas&#13;
of East Asia had been established in countries where a marked fall in&#13;
fertility was already in progress; some of the continued decline might have&#13;
occurred even without official programs. In other countries (such as India&#13;
and Pakistan), where programs were also established in the 1950s and 1960s,&#13;
fertility was changing little during the 1960s.&#13;
But organized family planning programs spread rapidly in the late&#13;
1960s and early 1970s. And beginning in the 1970s, information on family&#13;
planning programs has been systematically gathered that permits analysis of&#13;
the importance of the supply of family planning services compared with&#13;
demand factors in affecting use of family planning methods and in affecting&#13;
fertility. The evidence from these analyses is that both matter. Demand&#13;
factors have an effect independent of family planning programs. At the&#13;
same time, family planning programs have an effect independent of demand&#13;
factors. The two effects, though weak by themselves, are powerful in&#13;
combination.&#13;
The three papers in this volume represent an important&#13;
contribution to these analyses. The first, by W. Parker Mauldin and Robert&#13;
J. Lapham, is a careful and detailed explanation of their "index" of family&#13;
planning program effort, measured at the country level and designed to&#13;
allow cross-country comparisons. They first developed their index in the&#13;
early 1970s. It was based on countries' performance in 1972 on fifteen&#13;
criteria, such as the availability of many contraceptive methods, either&#13;
through government programs or commercially; inclusion of fertility&#13;
reduction in official policy; adequacy of the family planning&#13;
administrative structure; and use of mass media and fieldworkers. In&#13;
1983-84, they updated their index, based on countries' 1982 performance on&#13;
the same and additional criteria. The index is available for 87 countries&#13;
for both 1972 and 1982.&#13;
- vii -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- viii -&#13;
Their index for each country is based on the replies of country&#13;
experts to a questionnaire that seeks specific information about inputs to&#13;
a family planning policy. In their paper they explain how they have&#13;
combined and weighted the replies on separate criteria into a single index&#13;
for each country.   They point out some of the difficult measurement&#13;
problems in developing such an index, and discuss its resultant&#13;
shortcomings. They also analyze the links among and relative importance of&#13;
various inputs to the final index, and compare change in the index over&#13;
time across countries.&#13;
Mauldin and Lapham show that family planning program effort in&#13;
many countries is weak; in some countries though policy commitment is&#13;
strong, services have not been built up. The most important single&#13;
conclusion from their work, however, is the general tendency, despite&#13;
setbacks in a few countries, for family planning program effort to be&#13;
increasing over time in the developing world.&#13;
More importantly the index Mauldin and Lapham have developed,&#13;
because it is comparable across countries, has made possible the kinds of&#13;
analyses represented by the other two papers.&#13;
In the second paper, Bryan Boulier describes an economic model of&#13;
the demand for contraception and the demand for children and shows how&#13;
reductions in the costs of contraception can be expected to increase&#13;
contraceptive use and decrease fertility. He shows theoretically why women&#13;
who live near sources of modern contraceptives are systematically less&#13;
likely to want additional children, controlling for residence, education&#13;
and other socio-economic factors, than women who live far from a source --&#13;
in short why the demand for children will be lower the lower the costs of&#13;
obtaining and using contraception. Boulier then estimates the model for a&#13;
sample of developing countries, using the Mauldin-Lapham 1972 index of&#13;
family planning as one variable explaining fertility change over the period&#13;
1965 to 1975. Other variables include the change during the same period in&#13;
life expectancy, in adult literacy, in income per capita, and in the&#13;
proportion of the population in cities of 100,000 or more. The effect of&#13;
the family planning index is consistently positive -- that is a higher&#13;
index is associated with a greater decline in fertility -- and&#13;
statistically significant (see his Table 5; in Boulier's paper the index is&#13;
labelled "score").&#13;
Boulier uses a number of approaches to assure that this positive&#13;
effect of the family planning index is not exaggerated. One is to include&#13;
fertility change 1960-65 in the equation along with the index; countries&#13;
experiencing some fertility decline in the early 1960s are likely to have&#13;
experienced more in the 1965-75 period, all other things the same.&#13;
Inclusion of this variable does decrease the measured effect of the 1972&#13;
index on fertility decline, but it by no means eliminates the index's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ix -&#13;
effect, which remains statistically significant (for example, Table 5,&#13;
col. 4). Boulier also provides simultaneous equation estimates of the&#13;
fertility change equations with the index treated as an endogenous&#13;
variable. Fertility decline in the period 1960-65 turns out to be an&#13;
important predictor of the 1972 index; it is plausible that fertility&#13;
decline itself induces government officials to augment resources for&#13;
encouraging more fertility decline, particularly if it represents real&#13;
demand for more services. However, even taking into account that a&#13;
stronger family planning program in 1972 is associated with prior fertility&#13;
decline (in 1960-65), it is still true that the effect of the program on&#13;
fertility change in the concurrent period (1965-75) remains positive (Table&#13;
5, col. 6).&#13;
Finally Boulier provides an extensive and careful review of&#13;
within-country studies of the effects of organized family planning&#13;
programs, and of field experiments designed to directly test the effects of&#13;
greater availability of family planning services on contraceptive use and&#13;
fertility. He concludes:&#13;
Numerous studies of the effect of increased actual&#13;
availability, including the results of experiments,&#13;
indicate that increased access to sources of contra-&#13;
ceptive supply results in an increase in contraceptive&#13;
use and a decrease in fertility. Because of wide&#13;
differences in the characteristics of the populations&#13;
studied, because of differences among studies in the&#13;
measurement of access to methods of contraception, and&#13;
because of differences in methodology, it is not&#13;
possible to summarize easily the estimated impacts of&#13;
increased access on contraceptive use or fertility in&#13;
these studies. In some studies the effects of access&#13;
seem to be large (p. 51).&#13;
The third paper, by David Wheeler, adds in two ways to the first&#13;
two papers. First, Wheeler incorporates the 1982 as well as the 1972 index&#13;
of family planning into his analysis. He estimates the effect of change in&#13;
the index over that period (interacted with change in female schooling) on&#13;
the change in fertility, 1970 to 1980.    He estimates the effect of the&#13;
index taking into account the fact that the index itself is partly the&#13;
result of ongoing changes in education, fertility and income (i.e. like&#13;
Boulier he uses a simultaneous model in which the family planning index is&#13;
endogenous).&#13;
Two of his findings regarding the effects of organized family&#13;
planning programs merit special mention:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-x-&#13;
(1) In explaining fertility change, it is the combination of&#13;
family planning with female education which must be stressed.&#13;
Experimentation with alternative functional forms has&#13;
suggested strongly that the interactive specification is&#13;
appropriate. There is obviously a major policy implica-&#13;
tion in this result if it is to be believed: Rapid&#13;
expansion of family planning programs in societies where&#13;
females are being educated at low rates will not be very&#13;
effective. Conversely, rapid expansion in educational&#13;
opportunities for women seems to have proportionally&#13;
greater impact on fertility when strong family planning&#13;
programs are in place (p. A-29).&#13;
(2)  Government family planning effort itself has been "reactive"&#13;
in the 1970-80 period, i.e. "slow declines in fertility have&#13;
stimulated greater government effort, while rapid declines seem to&#13;
have retarded it" (p. A-35). Thus in his equation predicting the&#13;
change in the family planning index in the last decade, Wheeler gets a&#13;
result opposite to Boulier's. Boulier was of course explaining the&#13;
1972 level, not the 1972-82 change; in the early 1970s, governments&#13;
were more likely to implement family planning programs if fertility&#13;
was falling anyway, perhaps in response to demand for services.&#13;
However, in the more recent past, governments were more likely to&#13;
increase effort in family planning (usually from a lower base) where&#13;
fertility was still high, presumably due in part to concern with their&#13;
demographic situation.&#13;
Second, Wheeler incorporates his model of fertility change into a&#13;
larger model in which fertility change itself feeds back to affect economic&#13;
growth. He then uses the empirical results of estimating this model as a&#13;
basis for simulating the long-run benefits of alternative investment&#13;
strategies. The simulations permit him to compare the benefits of&#13;
equivalent investments in physical capital vs. social programs -- female&#13;
education and family planning.&#13;
The simulation results (for example, his simulations for Togo and&#13;
Malawi) communicate the "same unmistakable message...:    Investments in&#13;
female schooling and family planning yield large payoffs in the long run,"&#13;
(p 28), large, that is, compared with the equivalent investment in physical&#13;
capital. For Togo, the "social investment strategy" of investing in family&#13;
planning and education doubles anticipated income per capita by 2050 over&#13;
what it would be with the same resources going to physical investment.&#13;
Simulations for a range of countries indicate that the social investment&#13;
strategy is always better, with the degree of superiority greater where&#13;
prior social investments have already established high rates of female&#13;
schooling and family planning activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xi -&#13;
And what about the relative merits of investing in family&#13;
planning vs. female education? For reducing population growth itself (not&#13;
necessarily an end in itself), family planning investment yields superior&#13;
results, especially where education is already widespread (Malaysia, Brazil&#13;
and Mexico). For raising per capita income, female education dominates.&#13;
As Wheeler points out, his econometric results make it clear that&#13;
long-run economic growth models should incorporate demographic factors (and&#13;
conversely). Changes in national income have an impact on fertility, not&#13;
only directly but also indirectly -- through effects on family planning&#13;
activity and (through family planning) on infant mortality. Changes in&#13;
fertility and mortality in turn have an impact on the domestic savings rate&#13;
because they change population, the denominator of income per capita. In&#13;
addition, they are the essential determinants of growth in the labor force.&#13;
Wheeler's results also show that estimates of the rate of&#13;
return to investments in education and in family planning must take into&#13;
account both the demographic effects of these programs and their general&#13;
economic benefits. The three papers together make a powerful case for the&#13;
economic and demograpic benefits of investment in family planning programs.&#13;

IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, 1972 AND 1982&#13;

Abstract&#13;
This paper addresses the following questions:&#13;
o What are the key elements in population policies and&#13;
programs?&#13;
o What changes have occurred in population policies and&#13;
programs, including the strength of program effort, from&#13;
1972 to 1982?&#13;
Using a new scale with thirty items to measure family planning&#13;
program effort, the presentation is based on an analysis of over 300&#13;
questionnaires received from ninety-three countries. Attention is given&#13;
to measurement problems and change in program effort 1972-82 (including&#13;
findings by country and regional differences).&#13;
After about a quarter of a century of intensifying work in the&#13;
family planning field in developing countries, this study shows that a&#13;
great deal of family planning program effort exists in a small number of&#13;
countries; moderate effort occurs in a larger number of countries; and&#13;
weak or very little effort is found in an even greater number of&#13;
countries, including many in the Middle East, North Africa and&#13;
sub-Saharan Africa. Concerning change over time, between 1972 and 1982&#13;
there was a modest increase in program effort in more than half of the&#13;
nearly 100 countries studied and a substantial increase in program effort&#13;
in more than a third. In sub-Saharan Africa, about half of the countries&#13;
had no change in program effort during this decade, but the other half&#13;
did. Thus, modest beginnings vis-a-vis family planning programs have&#13;
occurred in this region; however, it takes a while to "crank up," so that&#13;
by 1982 only four countries in sub-Saharan Africa had reached even the&#13;
weak program effort category and none the moderate category, while only&#13;
Mauritius was in the strong category where it had been in 1972.&#13;
In a related study, we examined the impact of family planning&#13;
programs and of socioeconomic factors on fertility decline in the period&#13;
1965-80 and on contraceptive prevalence 1977-82. We find that the level&#13;
of "modernization," as reflected in seven socioeconomic factors, has a&#13;
substantial relationship to fertility decline in 1965-80. That was to be&#13;
expected based on sociodemographic theory. However, we also find that on&#13;
balance, family planning programs have a significant, independent effect&#13;
over and above the effect of socioeconomic factors. Good program effort&#13;
adds substantially to the amount of fertility decline or contraceptive&#13;
prevalence accounted for. On the other hand, weak and very weak programs&#13;
have little discernible impact on fertility decline.&#13;
To conclude, we believe that this and our related studies&#13;
demonstrate the ingredients of a good family planning program and the&#13;
utility of a family planning program as one element in the armamentarium&#13;
of development programs.&#13;

This paper reports some of the findings from a study initiated&#13;
by the authors in 1983.&#13;
The study has been carried out with primary support from The&#13;
Rockefeller Foundation, including a grant to Robert J. Lapham for&#13;
research on the measurement of family planning program effort.&#13;
Additional support necessary for the study was received from three other&#13;
sources--the Agency for International Development, The World Bank, and&#13;
The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. This support is gratefully&#13;
acknowledged.&#13;
We also received assistance from personnel in the Agency for&#13;
International Development, The World Bank, The United Nations Fund for&#13;
Population Activities, The International Planned Parenthood Federation,&#13;
and several other institutions. For example, these individuals helped&#13;
with the identification of persons knowledgeable about family planning&#13;
programs in each of about 100 developing nations. In addition to&#13;
expressing thanks for this support and assistance, we want to note with&#13;
particular appreciation some 400 population specialists around the world&#13;

including coding. Susan Lapham, now at the Bureau of the Census,&#13;
prepared computer programs for the scoring process and several tables.&#13;
The typing of text and complicated tables has been efficiently handled by&#13;
Lucy Santiago, at the Academy. Finally, appreciation is expressed to the&#13;
Population Council for the use of their computer and to Robert Sendek for&#13;
advice on how to make it produce desired calculations and graphs.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
Background and Purpose&#13;
In 1972, Lapham and Mauldin suggested that fifteen key items&#13;
could be used to characterize population policies and programs, and&#13;
presented data on these items for twenty developing countries (LDCs). In&#13;
1976, these same items were used by Freedman and Berelson in a study that&#13;
included twenty-three additional countries, while in 1978, they were used&#13;
by Mauldin and Berelson for an analysis of fertility decline in 1965-75&#13;
in ninety-four countries.&#13;
In the summer of 1983, Lapham and Mauldin decided to revise&#13;
this list of key items, and to gather information on them as of 1982.&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to report on the result of that&#13;
investigation.&#13;
In the present paper, we address the following questions:&#13;
o What changes have occurred in population policies and&#13;
programs, including the strength of program effort, from&#13;
1972 to 1982?&#13;
o What are the key elements in population policies and&#13;
programs?&#13;
Methodology&#13;
For our study, we expanded the number of key items to thirty&#13;
(Figure 1), based on consultation with a number of knowledgeable persons,&#13;
and pretested a new questionnaire among about thirty respondents. We&#13;
also consulted with a large number of personnel within such organizations&#13;
as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), the World&#13;
Bank, the Agency for International Development (AID), The Population&#13;

Scale Item                           Descriotion&#13;
A. POLICY AJD STArE-SETTING ACTIVITIES&#13;
l.*  Goverment's official           Existence and type of official policy:   to reduce the population growth rate;&#13;
policy or position concerning        or to support family planning activitiea for othar than demographic resons;&#13;
fertility/family planning and       or to allow private and/or comercial family pltnning activitiea in the absence&#13;
rates of population growth           of government-sponsored activity; or to discourage fmily planning services.&#13;
2.*  Favorable statemnts by         Whether or not the head of the government speaks publicly and favorably about&#13;
ledere                              fmily planning at least once or twice a year. and whether or not other high&#13;
officials do so alco.&#13;
3. Level of femily planning          Level of the post (person appointed) to direct the national government fmily&#13;
program leadership                   planning program, and whether or not the program director reports to the&#13;
highest level of goverment.&#13;
4. Age at mrriage policy             Kinimum legal age at marriage for fmolese at least 18 (higher scores for minimuv&#13;
legal ages of 19 and 20). end the extent of effort to enforce any changes in the&#13;
law since 1960 regarding legal age at merriage for females. (The score for the&#13;
letter component is allowed only if the new legal minimum is at least 18.)&#13;
5.*  Import laws and legal           Extent to which import laws and legal regulations facilitate the importation of&#13;
regulations regarding                contraceptive supplies that are not manufactured locally, and/or the extent to&#13;
contraceptives                       which contraceptives are manufactured within the country.&#13;
6. Advertising of                    Whether or not the advertising of contraceptives in the mass media is allowed&#13;
contraceptives in the mess media     with no restrictions; whether there are weak restrictions; whether there are social&#13;
allowed                              restrictions; or whether there are strong restrictions.&#13;
7.  Other ministries/government     Aside from the ministry or goverment agency that has primary responsibility for&#13;
agencies involved                    delivering family planning supplies and services, the extent to which other&#13;
sinistries and governmet agencies assist with femily planning and/or other&#13;
population activities. This involvement or assistance may be provided through the&#13;
public sector, or through privatesector family planning program or population&#13;
activities, and is classified as follows: assistance with the delivery of fmily&#13;
planning supplies and services; assistance in the form of services particular to&#13;
thet ministry; assistance with family planning information and education in&#13;
specific vays; mmbership on a council for family planning that meets at least&#13;
twice annually; moral support and smull miscellaneous assistance; none.&#13;
8.*  In-country budget for          Percent of the total fmily planning/population budget available frm in-country&#13;
program                              sources. A top score is given if in-country sources provide 852 or more of the&#13;
budget; no score is givon if these sources provide less than 502 of the budget.&#13;
B. SERVICE AND SE3VICE-ISELATED ACTIVITIES&#13;
9.  Involvemnt of private-           Extent to which private-sector agencies and groups assist with femily planning&#13;
aector agencies and groups           and/or other pOpulation activities.   These groups include fmily planning&#13;
associations, ipecial service groups (e.g., for sterilization services), religious&#13;
associations, sad so on.   The involvent or assistaxnc   with family planning and&#13;
population activities my include the following: delivery of family plenning&#13;
supplies and services; training; fxmily planning informtion and education;&#13;
asmberehip in a fmily planning interagency group that _mets at least tvice&#13;
annually; morel support; or other types of assistance.&#13;
10. Civil bureaucracy used           Use of the civil bureaucracy of the goverment to enaure that program directives&#13;
are carried out, and the extent to which the senior government administrator at&#13;
the following levels feols responsible for the auccess of the progra: central&#13;
goverment level; provincial or state levels; district/governorate/regency/etc.&#13;
levels; county levels.&#13;
11. Co_munity-based                  Proportion of the country covered by CID programs for the distribution of&#13;
distribution-CID                     contraceptives in areas not easily served by clinics or other service points.&#13;
Public and/or private CID eyetem are included. The essential feature of CAD is&#13;
that the contraceptive supplies are available upon request within the village.&#13;
local community. or local residence noighborhood. CID progra are essumed to be&#13;
primrily rural; however, a partial extra score is allowed for urban-area CAD&#13;
programs.&#13;
12. Social   arketing                Proportion of the country covered by a social marketing program, that is.&#13;
subsidised contraceptive *aleo in the comercial sector. The essential feature of&#13;
social marketing is that contraceptives are sold at low cost, ie., a (heavily)&#13;
subsidised price, through channels easily available to rural and7or urban&#13;
residents, such as local shope, pharmacies or spocially created local sales&#13;
outlets.  8      torms of social _ sating are called "cme_rcial retail sales"&#13;
Progr _ (Ct8). Social marketing program are aeseud to be prim_rily urban&#13;
pror_ms; however, an extra score is allowea for rural-area programs.&#13;

Scale item                           Description&#13;
13.*  Postpartum programs            Extent of coverage of new mothers by postpartum programs, which may be hospital-&#13;
or field-based. Most programs are of the former type. For hospital-based&#13;
programs, the score is constructed from the proportion of deliveries in hospitals&#13;
and maternity centers for which the new mothers are provided a family planning&#13;
information and education service (by trained fesale workers), and the proportion&#13;
of all deliveries in the country that take place in hospitals and maternity&#13;
centers (often a emall proportion). For field-based postpartum programs, the&#13;
score is constructed from the proportion of women that are deliverea of their&#13;
babies at home, and that are offered a family planning information and education&#13;
service by trained field workers.&#13;
14.*  Home-visiting vorkers          Proportion of the population covered by a group of workers whose primary task is&#13;
to visit women in their homes (et least in the rural areas) to talk about family&#13;
planning and child care. Account is taken of the population that must be covered&#13;
by each field worker; the score for the proportion of the country covered by field&#13;
workers is deflated if the average population covered by each home-visiting worker&#13;
is more than 15,000.&#13;
15. Administrative structure         Whether or not there is an adequate administrative structure and staff at three&#13;
levels (national, provincial, and county). "Adequate" mans that the administra-&#13;
tive structure is sufficient to ensure that plans developed for each level are&#13;
carried out; that the administrative structure is capable of recognizing and&#13;
solving problems that cause low performance; and that the administrative structure&#13;
is able and willing to use existing resources and/or to call upon higher&#13;
administrative levels in obtaining resources needed to carry out plans for the&#13;
delivery of family planning supplies and services.&#13;
16.*  Training programs              Whether or not there is an adequate training program for each category of staff in&#13;
the family planning program: administrative staff; physicians; nurses;&#13;
paraprofessionals; village-level distributors; field workers/motivators; staff in&#13;
other ministries and organizations; other types. "Adequate" ma*ne that the&#13;
training provides personnel with the knowledge, information, and skills necessary&#13;
to carry out their jobs effectively, and that facilities exist to carry out the&#13;
training. The score is determined by the extent to which the training program.&#13;
for each category of staff, is very good, moderately good, m_diocre or poor, or&#13;
nonexistent.&#13;
17.  Personnel carry out             Extent to which each-category of family planning program staff carries out&#13;
assigned tasks                       assigned tasks (task implementation):   administrative staff; physicians;&#13;
nurses; paraprofessionals; village-level distributors; field workers/motivators;&#13;
staff in other ministries and organizations; other types. The score is determined&#13;
on the basis of the extent to which each category of staff carries out assigned&#13;
tasks very well, moderately well, or poorly.&#13;
18.*  Logistics and transport       Extent to which the logistics and transportation systems are sufficient to keep&#13;
stocks of contraceptive supplies and related equipmedt available at all service&#13;
points at all times, at the following levels: central; provincial; county. The&#13;
score is based on the availability of supplies and equipment: all or almost all&#13;
of the time; about half to three-quartere of the time; sometimes; or seldom or&#13;
never.&#13;
19.  Supervision                    Whether or not there is an adequate system of supervision at all levels.&#13;
"Adequate" means that: (a) supervisors exist at all levels of program operations&#13;
in sufficient numbers to make possible supervisory visits at least once a month at&#13;
service-delivery levels (and quarterly at higher administrative levels); (b) that&#13;
supervisors in fact make such supervisory visits--to the work sites of the persons&#13;
supervised; (c) that, during these supervisory visits, encouragement, advice, and&#13;
support are provided to supervised workers, in addition to any necessary checking&#13;
of operations and recorde that assist in the evaluation of worker performance; and&#13;
(d) that supervisors carry through on providing/obtaining supplies and services&#13;
identified as needed during their visits (or at least *mke serious att npts to&#13;
obtain these needed supplies and services).&#13;
20.*  Mass wedia for                 Frequency of mass media messages that provide family planning information,&#13;
information, education, and          including where family planning services are available, and how much of the&#13;
co-cunications (lE4C)                country is covered by various types of sass media: newspapers; magazines; radio;&#13;
TV; mobile IE4C units (film , etc.); billboards and other outdoor media (buses,&#13;
etc.); traditional types (puppet shows, folk dances, local theatre, etc.); other&#13;
types. The frequency classifications include: at least once a month; somtimes&#13;
(about once every three to six months); infrequently (about once a year or lese&#13;
often); never.&#13;
21.  incentives/disincentives        Use of monetary or other incentives for the adoption of family planning.    The&#13;
incentives may be provided to: clients; recruiters; service personnel, including&#13;
CBD personnel; cv-unities. The disincentives may refer to individuale or to&#13;
communities, and include regulations or constraints designed to encourage family&#13;
planning and/or sewll family size.&#13;

C.   ECOLD MIEPIiG AW EVALUATION&#13;
22.*  Record keeping                 Whether or not there are record keeping systema for family planning clients at the&#13;
clinic level, plus a system for the collection and periodic reporting of sumaery&#13;
statistics at regional and national levels (that is. numbers of acceptors,&#13;
supplies distributed, namers of workers, and so on), and whether or not thbre is&#13;
feedback to each reporting unit fro, regional- or n-tional-level units. The&#13;
scoring takes into account tha existence of good systms, as well as their&#13;
isplemntation. Feedback refers to the reporting back to lower-level units, on a&#13;
regular basis, with progress masured against some standard, such as acceptance or&#13;
prevalence targets or trends.&#13;
23.*  Evaluation                     Whether or not ao   or all of the following exist (sooe score given for each):&#13;
regular estimation of prevalence levels antd trends (annually or quarterly) using&#13;
program statistics and estimxted continuation rates; masurn_nt every two to four&#13;
years of family planning prevalence levels and trends using data collection&#13;
mthods that are independent fro program statistics (such as contraceptive&#13;
prevalence studies); isplemntation of operations research studies deaigned to&#13;
help program managnt understand the program, its problemss and potential&#13;
isprovemnts; professional staff in an evaluation unit who prepare technically&#13;
correct periodic reports on the program, what it has achieved, etc.; professional&#13;
staff who interpret and suxmarize, for program managemenc, national and regional&#13;
population data collected through census*a, vital registration systems, and&#13;
surveys (these staff may be directly *asociated with the program or in other&#13;
institutions); good coordination, working relationships, and timely sharing of&#13;
information between the evaluation unit and other units in fanily planning&#13;
progrms.   So   score is also given for the existence of universities or research&#13;
institutes in the country that carry out dowgraphic research, family planning&#13;
research, or population research of other kinds.&#13;
24. Nanagaent use of                 Extent to which the program managers (decision makers) use the research and&#13;
evaluation findings                  evaluation findings to improve the program in ways suggested by those findings.&#13;
D. AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY&#13;
OF FERTILITY )HNTROL iETHDDS&#13;
25.** Hale sterilization             Whether or not sedically adequate voluntary sterilization services for males are&#13;
legally and openly available, and the percentage of the population that haa ready&#13;
and easy access to such services.&#13;
26.**  Fmale sterilisation          Whether or not mdically adequate voluntary sterilization services for females are&#13;
legally and openly available, and the percentage of the population that has ready&#13;
and easy access to such services.&#13;
27.**' Pills (Injectables)           Percentage of the couples of reproductive age who have ready and easy access to&#13;
pills, through programa other than CBD and social sarketing program. "Ready and&#13;
easy access" mans that the recipient spends no more than an average of two hours&#13;
per month to obtain contraceptive supplies and services. Easy access also implies&#13;
that the cost of contraceptive supplies is not burdensome. i.e., a one-onth&#13;
supply of contraceptives should cost less than 1I of a month's wages to met this&#13;
criterion. (If the availability of injectables is higher than that of pills, the&#13;
data on injectables were used to score this item.)&#13;
28.***  Condoms (and other           Percentage of the couples of reproductive age who have ready and easy access to&#13;
conventionals)                       condoms, tbrough programs other than CBD and social marketing programs.    "Ready&#13;
and easy accaes" is the sam as defined above. (If the availability of other&#13;
conventionals is greater than that of condom, the date on other conventionalc&#13;
were used to score this itea.)&#13;
29.***  lUDs                         Percentage of the couploe of reproductive age who have ready and easy access to&#13;
IUDs, through program  other than CID and social marketing program.    "Ready and&#13;
easy access" is defined as in item 27.&#13;
30.'  Abortion                       Proportion of the population that has ready and easy access to abortion services,&#13;
whether or not abortions are legal, but excluding in the scoring the availability&#13;
of abortions carried out only under poor conditions.&#13;
*lIcluded in the 1972 program effort scale, although with lose detail for some queastions.&#13;
*"Included in the 1972 program effort scale, as a combined question on the availability of mwle and famle&#13;
sterilization services.&#13;
***Included in the 1972 program effort scale, as two questions: (a) on ready end easy access to pills, lIUD,&#13;
and  condom    tbroughout the country in both the public  nd privwte sectors; (b) whether or not the Ministry&#13;
of Health carries out a vigorous effort to provide fmily PlaMing services throughout the country.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Council, The Pathfinder Fund, Battelle Memorial Institute, The Futures&#13;
Group, The Research Triangle Institute (RTI), the International Planned&#13;
Parenthood Federation (IPPF) in London, the IPPF Western Hemisphere, and&#13;
Westinghouse Public Applied Systems, to develop a mailing list of persons&#13;
knowledgeable about population policies and programs in specific&#13;
countries. The questionnaire was translated from English into French and&#13;
Spanish, and mailings were begun in late July 1983 to a sample of&#13;
approximately 630 respondents, including personnel from agencies such as&#13;
UNFPA, the World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), and AID; program&#13;
personnel; and other knowledgeable people both within and outside&#13;
specific countries. We have had two follow-up mailings, and have&#13;
received replies from more than 425 of our sample, a response rate of 67&#13;
percent. This paper is based on an analysis of the first 307&#13;
questionnaires received from ninety-three countries as of early December&#13;
1983.&#13;
Measures of family planning program effort include several&#13;
items based on the judgments of knowledgeable actors (in family planning&#13;
programs) and observers, rather than on the reported results of counting&#13;
and sorting operations. With this data set, two broad sources of error&#13;
must be considered: first, the validity of the actor or observer&#13;
judgments, for example, about the quality of training programs, or of&#13;
logistic systems; and second, the validity of the authors'&#13;
interpretations of inconsistent respondent judgments on a given country's&#13;
program.&#13;
Almost anyone acquainted with family planning programs in more&#13;
than a handful of countries "knows" that some programs are "better" than&#13;
others. Nonetheless, assigning objective criteria to distinguish between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
good and poor programs is no small task, and one not often attempted by&#13;
researchers. In this paper, a new measure of program effort is&#13;
presented, which we believe is improved over our 1972 measure. However,&#13;
it is not without problems. For example, the new scale includes&#13;
attention to private sector activities, but further modification of this&#13;
measure might improve the measurement of such activities. In addition,&#13;
at the conceptual level, a number of the scale items depend heavily on&#13;
judgments, rather than on observable and thereby verifiable facts.1/&#13;
However, these judgments have been made by persons knowledgeable about&#13;
the program on which they reported.&#13;
A Framework for Understanding Program Effort&#13;
Family planning programs are carried out within a variety of&#13;
social and economic contexts, and their effects coincide with those of&#13;
other influences on contraceptive use and fertility; it is therefore&#13;
important to conceptualize the ways in which family planning programs&#13;
might affect prevalence and fertility. Figure 2 represents schematically&#13;
a conceptual framework that draws on earlier work by Freedman (1961-62),&#13;
Easterlin (1978), and the Panel on Fertility Determinants, National&#13;
Academy of Sciences (1983), with greater attention to the detailed&#13;
processes "inside the program," and recognition of the proximate&#13;
determinants of fertility.&#13;
Within our framework, program effort is characterized according&#13;
to four components. First, there are two broad groups of program&#13;
activities: policy and stage-setting activities (those steps a&#13;
government, and/or to some degree private organizations, might undertake&#13;
to affect the organization and implementation of a program); and service&#13;
and service-related activities (steps taken to make it easier for people&#13;

to obtain and use a variety of family planning methods). Closely, linked&#13;
to service delivery is record keeping and evaluation. Taken together,&#13;
these three groups of activities "inside the program" make possible the&#13;
availability and accessibility of fertility-control supplies and services&#13;
(contraceptives, male and female sterilization, and, where culturally&#13;
acceptable, abortion services). The responses to questionnaires used for&#13;
this study were organized according to these components, which are&#13;
described in detail in our full report.&#13;
Changes in Program Effort 1972-82&#13;
The major differences between the 1972 and 1982 measures of&#13;
program effort are as follows:&#13;
o There are thirty items in the 1982 measure, as compared with&#13;
fifteen items in the 1972 scale; twelve of the fifteen 1972 items&#13;
are very similar in both scales, while three were represented by&#13;
five questions for the new scale. One of the last-mentioned items,&#13;
on "vigorous effort" to provide supplies and services, was not&#13;
included directly in the 1982 scale.&#13;
o The 1982 questions were much more detailed than those for 1972.&#13;
O The scores for 1972 were zero, one, or two, whereas the 1982 scores&#13;
ranged from zero to four, and part scores (for example, 0.5 or 0.1)&#13;
were used. Thus at the low end of the scale, small efforts&#13;
received a positive score in 1982 but a zero score in 1972.&#13;
Accordingly, a minor part of the reported increase in scores from&#13;
1972 and 1982 is attributable to the revised scoring system,&#13;
although this probably accounts for no more than one or two points.&#13;
In the new scale, there are eight items on policy and stage-setting&#13;
activities, thirteen on service and service-related activities, three on&#13;
record keeping and evaluation, and six on the availability and&#13;
accessibility of fertility-control supplies and services. (Copies of the&#13;
questionnaire and of the scoring codes and rules are available upon&#13;
request. They will be published in the forthcoming full report on this&#13;
study.)&#13;

With thirty items, the possible total scoring range is 0-120.&#13;
Within this range, possible scores have been divided into four levels of&#13;
effort:&#13;
Program Effort Level           Score&#13;
Strong                         80 and above&#13;
Moderate                       55-79&#13;
Weak                            25-54&#13;
Very little or none             0-24&#13;
One aspect of this scoring process must be emphasized: the&#13;
reported scores represent the authors' best judgment as to the score&#13;
indicated by the data received. Specifically, instead of taking the&#13;
average of all answers on the questionnaires received for each country,&#13;
we tried to ascertain the most appropriate score for each item for each&#13;
country, using all of the information provided and otherwise available.&#13;
For example, marginal notes and comments at the end of the questionnaires&#13;
often provided clues; for some items, such as policies, reference was&#13;
made to other documents, such as The Population Council Fact Books&#13;
(Nortman and Fisher, 1982; Tietze, 1983) and the United Nations&#13;
Monitoring Reports (United Nations, 1982 and forthcoming). In some&#13;
cases, especially when no other information was available, the respondent&#13;
data were averaged, although even in these cases, a respondent way out of&#13;
line with others tended to be discounted.&#13;
The score range for each scale item is 0-4, with four&#13;
indicating a strong policy or much activity on an item. However, a four&#13;
does not mean that the maximum possible is being accomplished in the&#13;
country. For example, a score of 4 on the training item can be obtained&#13;
by having "very good" answers on training for two categories of&#13;
personnel, and "moderately good" on training for four other categories.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Such a country might have poor training for a seventh category of&#13;
personnel; in any case, the four "moderately good" situations could be&#13;
improved.&#13;
Finally, the combined 1972 and 1982 program effort score was&#13;
obtained by multiplying the 1972 score by two and dividing the 1982 score&#13;
by two. This gave equal weight to the 1972 and 1982 scores since the&#13;
maximum for the 1972 score was 30, and for the 1982 score was 120. The&#13;
same cutting points as those previously established for the 1982 score&#13;
were used to characterize programs as follows:&#13;
Strong                  80+&#13;
Moderate             55-79&#13;
Weak                 25-55&#13;
Very Weak             0-24&#13;
or None&#13;
This combined scale is used later in this paper, in an analysis of&#13;
program effort and fertility decline.&#13;
Findings by Country&#13;
Figure 3 is a scatter diagram of program effort scores in 1972&#13;
and 1982, with each set of scores being transformed to a 0-100 scale. In&#13;
general, there are more countries above than below the diagonal; this&#13;
reflects moderately higher scores in 1982 than in 1972. Countries with&#13;
the highest scores are very close to the diagonal; that is, countries&#13;
with very high scores in 1972 typically maintained a strong program&#13;
during the intervening decade. Countries with significantly weaker&#13;
programs in 1982 than in 1972 include Costa Rica, Fiji, Vietnam, and&#13;
Jamaica. Countries with significantly stronger programs in 1982 than in&#13;
1972 include Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Mexico, and Bangladesh.&#13;
Figure 3 also indicates that the average score increased from twenty-one&#13;

to thirty during the decade, whereas the median score increased only from&#13;
twenty-three to twenty-five. (Recall that for this scatter diagram, the&#13;
scale is 0-100; on the scale of 0-120 used throughout the rest of this&#13;
paper and in companion pieces, the increase in the average score for the&#13;
countries included in both years is from twenty-five to thirty-five).&#13;
The changes in program effort scores are summarized in a 4x4&#13;
table (Table 1), which classifies scores as strong, moderate, weak, very&#13;
weak, or none. Although this table obscures some of the changes, it also&#13;
reflects others that are significant. Most of the countries remain on&#13;
the diagonal, although the first group of countries identified above&#13;
shifted from strong in 1972 to moderate in 1982, and to weak in the case&#13;
of Costa Rica. Mexico and Bangladesh moved from weak to moderate, and&#13;
Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Colombia moved from moderate to strong. The&#13;
largest gainers in program effort are shown in Figure 4.&#13;
Table 2 presents scores for both overall program effort and the&#13;
four components described earlier--policy and stage-setting activities,&#13;
service and service-related activities, record keeping and evaluation,&#13;
and availability and accessibility (AA). The table lists the&#13;
ninety-three countries in order of program effort score. Ranging widely&#13;
in their total program effort scores, the ninety-three countries include&#13;
several with little or no program effort, and nine with scores over&#13;
eighty. One of the latter, the People's Republic of China, is the only&#13;
country to surpass 100, although three other countries in East Asia score&#13;
in the nineties; Mexico, at seventy-nine, just misses this top category.&#13;
In general, the high-scoring countries tend to do well on all components;&#13;
note in particular their AA scores, which are at or near the maximum of&#13;
twenty-four in five of the nine cases.&#13;

How good is a score of ninety or more on this scale with a&#13;
possible maximum of 120? Excellent, we suggest, and scores in the&#13;
eighties are very good. However, another way to examine the data in&#13;
Table 2 is according to how well countries do on each component. Other&#13;
than total scores, what differentiates the strong, moderate, and weak&#13;
program effort countries? For each program effort level, Table 3 shows&#13;
the mean score and mean proportion of the maximum score obtained on each&#13;
component. The results are instructive. For two components in Table 3--&#13;
service and service-related activities, and availability and&#13;
accessibility--the strong program effort countries score nearly three&#13;
times as high as the weak effort countries. The differences among effort&#13;
levels on policy and stage-setting activities are much less--69 percent&#13;
of the maximum among the strong effort countries and 40 percent among the&#13;
weak effort countries. It appears that the countries with strong program&#13;
effort give considerable attention to providing services and to making&#13;
sure that fertility-control supplies and services are readily and easily&#13;
available and accessible to the population.&#13;
An additional comment is necessary. There is a lag, typically&#13;
of several years, between the adoption of a policy, the implementation of&#13;
the program, and resultant effects on fertility. Thus, countries that&#13;
have recently adopted policies to reduce fertility may score high on this&#13;
item but score less well on other items. Also, policy and stage-setting&#13;
activities may be the easiest to implement in the development of&#13;
population programs. If so, one would expect countries in general to&#13;
score higher on this component. The data in Table 3 suggest that this is&#13;
in fact the case: for all ninety-three countries, the highest proportion&#13;
of the maximum score is obtained for the policy and stage-setting&#13;

activities. This can be attributed to the countries in the weak and very&#13;
weak/none program effort groups. That is, in these countries, the&#13;
percentage of the maximum score is higher for policy and stage-setting&#13;
activities than for other components: for the weak effort group, 40&#13;
percent versus 25, 30, and 33 percent; and for the very weak/none group,&#13;
14 percent versus 6, 7, and 8 percent.&#13;
Regional Differences&#13;
While not surprising to specialists in the population field,&#13;
the regional differences revealed by our study are remarkable: the mean&#13;
unweighted program effort scores for 1982 are fifty-five for countries in&#13;
South and East Asia, and forty-six for countries in Latin America (Table&#13;
4); the mean unweighted scores for countries in the Middle East and North&#13;
Africa, and in sub-Saharan Africa, are much lower--twenty-four and&#13;
eighteen respectively.&#13;
Table 4 also shows the means weighted by population size, for&#13;
all ninety-three countries, for each region, and for components within&#13;
regions. Whereas the mean unweighted program effort score for the&#13;
ninety-three countries is about thirty-five, the weighted score is double&#13;
that; the large countries, with their strong and moderate program effort,&#13;
pull up the weighted average. Prominent in this process, of course, is&#13;
China, but India's score of seventy-five for 706 million people also&#13;
increases the weighted mean. Thus, measured on a country-by-country&#13;
basis, the score of thirty-five out of 120 suggests a long way to go,&#13;
while measured on a population basis, an average score of seventy out of&#13;
120 means a much higher level of program effort.&#13;
The regional differences are highlighted by the weighted&#13;
scores. For East and South Asia, the weighted mean scores, total and for&#13;

each component, go up; to a lesser degree, the same occurs for Latin&#13;
America. However, the result in Africa is the same: weighted and&#13;
unweighted scores are low, especially for the components availability and&#13;
accessibility of fertility-control supplies and services, and service and&#13;
service-related activities. Therefore, the differences between&#13;
sub-Sahara Africa and East and South Asia are greater in light of the&#13;
weighted scores.&#13;
The lower panel in Table 4 presents the unweighted and weighted&#13;
means in terms of the percent of maximum score. For all ninety-three&#13;
countries, the weighted percent of maximum score is fifty-nine, but the&#13;
differences among regions are striking: the score for South and East&#13;
Asia at 70 percent of the maximum is five-fold greater than that for&#13;
sub-Saharan'Africa, and considerably higher than that for Latin America&#13;
and the Middle East and North Africa.&#13;
A Parsimonious Set of Program Effort Items&#13;
Steps described in detail in our full report led to the&#13;
selection of a parsimonious set of program effort variables, which&#13;
together turn out to be excellent predictors of crude birth rate&#13;
declines:&#13;
1. Supervision system&#13;
2. Personnel carry out assigned tasks&#13;
3. Use of mass media for information, education, and&#13;
communication (IE&amp;C)&#13;
4. Postpartum programs&#13;
5. Availability and accessibility of fertility-control&#13;
supplies and services.&#13;
6. Management use of evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
These variables give an R2 value of .80 with CBR decline 1965-80. Note&#13;
that this set includes five individual program effort items plus the&#13;
availability and accessibility component, that is, the summary measure&#13;
for that component. The five individual items include four service and&#13;
service-related items, one record-keeping and evaluation item, and no&#13;
policy and stage-setting items. An R2 of .77 is obtained using three of&#13;
the variables, supervision system, personnel carry out assigned tasks,&#13;
and availability/accessibility. It should be noted that several items&#13;
included in our program effort scale such as social marketing and use of&#13;
incentives have been but little used. If they are used more in the&#13;
future it is possible that they would be important indicators of a&#13;
successful program.&#13;
It is of some interest to compare this set of predictors with&#13;
the "least good" set, which includes the following:&#13;

Many family planning programs have been in existence for a decade or&#13;
more, and we speculate that the relatively small contribution of the&#13;
first three items listed above reflects the fact that while probably&#13;
important, these items are inadequate without the addition of&#13;
programmatic activities. We may not have a good measure of training&#13;
programs, and it may be that how workers actually perform their jobs is&#13;
much more important than the training program itself. Incentives and&#13;
disincentives have been little used, with the notable exceptions of China&#13;
and Singapore, and as a result there is not much variance in the scores&#13;

on this item for most of the countries. Similarly, social marketing&#13;
programs are relatively new and are not yet widely used.&#13;
Program Effort and Fertility Decline&#13;
We turn next to a brief cross-tabulational analysis relating&#13;
our program effort index to fertility decline. Table 5 presents data on&#13;
CBR decline .1965-80 2/, with countries classified by socioeconomic&#13;
setting in 1970 3/ and by strength of program effort 1972-82. The mean&#13;
CBR decline in each of the 16 cells of the table was calculated by&#13;
assigning unit weights to each country. It is also possible to weight&#13;
the data by population size. However, when this is done, China dominates&#13;
the summary values in the column and row in which it is located. (Using&#13;
weights by population size increases the average CBR decline for&#13;
countries with a strong program effort from the 36 shown to 43, and the&#13;
average value for countries in the upper middle socioeconomic group from&#13;
13 to 37. Similarly, India lowers the average for countries with&#13;
moderate program effort from 26 to 21, and increases the average for&#13;
countries in the lower middle social setting group from 5 to 15.)&#13;
The mean CBR declines in the 16 cells of the table, with unit&#13;
weights for countries, are as follows:&#13;

The CBR declines increase in an orderly fashion as one moves from very&#13;
weak or none to strong on program effort, and from low to high on social&#13;
setting. The single exception is the. cell in which China is located--&#13;
strong on program effort and upper middle on social setting. China's CBR&#13;
decline has been greater than might be expected on the basis of its&#13;
socioeconomic conditions. However, that country's extremely strong&#13;
population policy and program are well known, and thus the reader is&#13;
unlikely to be surprised by this large decrease in fertility rates&#13;
despite more modest, though impressive, socioeconomic achievements. CBR&#13;
declines are somewhat greater when countries are classified by strength&#13;
of program effort rather than by social setting; this suggests that&#13;
program effort can, and does, lead to more rapid fertility decline than&#13;
would be likely based only on SES variables. (The marginal CBR declines&#13;
range from 1 to 25 on social setting and from 3 to 36 on program effort.)&#13;
A few countries merit attention. Indonesia is well known for&#13;
its vigorous family planning program, which we classified as moderate in&#13;
1972 and strong in 1982. On social setting, it ranks in the lower middle&#13;
group. Indonesia's CBR decline was appreciably more than expected on the&#13;
basis of SES--28 percent rather than the average of 5 for all countries&#13;
in that grouping. Mexico did not start its population program until&#13;
1974, but by 1982 had developed a moderately strong program. Its average&#13;
program effort score for the 1972-82 period placed it just below the&#13;
cut-off point between weak and moderate effort. Finally, although&#13;
Brazil, Turkey, and Lebanon are examples of countries with weak or very&#13;
weak program efort, they rank relatively high on SES variables, and their&#13;
CBR declines have been more than 25 percent. Private-sector family&#13;
planning efforts are significant in several states in Brazil; moreover,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
some observers believe that organized family planning programs plus&#13;
availability and accessibility of fertility-control methods should place&#13;
Brazil in the moderate program effort group. We believe, however, that&#13;
these three countries illustrate fertility decline that is due primarily&#13;
to socioeconomic factors, coupled with changing demand for children.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
After about a. quarter of a century of intensifying work in the&#13;
family planning field in developing countries, this study shows that a&#13;
great deal of family planning program effort exists in a small number of&#13;
countries; moderate effort occurs in a larger number of countries; and&#13;
weak or very little effort is found in an even greater number of&#13;
countries, including many in the Middle East, North Africa, and sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa. However, despite increases in program effort during the&#13;
last decade in a number of countries, program effort remains low in many&#13;
countries, especially as regards the ready and easy availability and&#13;
accessibility of fertility-control supplies and services.&#13;
Concerning change over time, between 1972 and 1982 there was a&#13;
modest increase in program effort in more than half of the ninety-three&#13;
countries studied and a substantial increase in program effort in more&#13;
than a third. Table 6 summarizes these changes, using four SES&#13;
categories and, to measure change in program effort, the difference in&#13;
the proportions of the maximum score obtained in 1972 and 1982. The&#13;
first column in Table 6 indicates a scattering of countries with modest&#13;
to substantial increases in program effort, in all four SES categories.&#13;
The second column, where countries up in proportion .10 to .24 are&#13;
listed, has a larger number, again in all four SES categories, including&#13;
seven with low SES--six of them in sub-Saharan Africa. A still larger&#13;

number of countries had essentially no change in program effort between&#13;
1972 and 1982, some because they scored high on the program effort scale&#13;
in 1972 and stayed high (for example, Singapore and Taiwan), and some&#13;
because they scored low on both dates. A handful of countries, nearly&#13;
all with high SES, went down in program effort between 1972 and 1982.&#13;
To show the relationship between change in program effort&#13;
1972-82 and the actual level in 1982, the strength of program effort in&#13;
the latter year is indicated in Table 6 by the symbols + and x: ++ =&#13;
strong; + = moderate; x = weak. Among the nine countries in the first&#13;
column (up in proportion .25 or more), in 1982, two had strong program&#13;
effort, two had moderate program effort, and five were still in the weak&#13;
category. The second column in Table 6 also includes a wide range of&#13;
1982 program effort, here with the addition of several countries that had&#13;
very weak program effort in 1982. A clear message here is that there is&#13;
much room for increased program effort. Note that among the thirteen&#13;
countries that went up .10-.24 in proportion, nine were still in the weak&#13;
category in 1982.&#13;
The question of program effort change 1972-82 can also be&#13;
examined from a regional perspective, presented in Table 7. Here we see&#13;
that the South and East Asia region is represented in all four columns,&#13;
as is Latin America. The sub-Saharan African countries are bunched in&#13;
the two middle columns; about half had no change in program effort during&#13;
this decade, but the other half did. Thus, modest beginnings vis-a-vis&#13;
family planning programs have occurred in this region; however, it takes&#13;
a while to "crank up," so that by 1982 only four countries had reached&#13;
even the weak category and none the moderate category, while only&#13;
Mauritius was in the strong category, where it had been in 1972.&#13;

As regards fertility decline during the period 1965-80 on which&#13;
we concentrated, there was substantial fertility decline in Asia (about&#13;
26 percent) and in the Americas (about 23 percent); however, there was&#13;
almost no decline in sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 15 percent decline&#13;
in only three countries in the Middle East and North Africa (Turkey,&#13;
Tunisia, and Cyprus). Several large countries--Bangladesh, Pakistan, and&#13;
Nigeria--have had hardly any change and still have high fertility.&#13;
However, large countries--those with populations of 40 million or&#13;
more--showed greater declines than did smaller countries: an average of&#13;
27 percent as compared with less than 9 percent. China is so large that&#13;
it affects the average appreciably. If this is left out of the&#13;
calculations, countries with 40 million or more population had an average&#13;
decline of 18 percent.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
This paper reviews the evidence on the effects of family planning&#13;
programs and increased accessibility and availability of contraception&#13;
supplies on contraceptive use and fertility. Following the presentation of an&#13;
economic model which provides a framework for evaluating empirical analyses of&#13;
the determinants of contraceptive use and fertility, the paper gives estimates&#13;
of the effects of the expansion of national family planning programs on&#13;
fertility decline in developing countries and then reviews past research on&#13;
the effects of increased contraceptive availability within countries.&#13;
A regression analysis of cross-national data indicates that the&#13;
expansion of family planning programs from 1965 to 1975 resulted in measurable&#13;
fertiltiy decline even after controlling for trends in fertility prior to 1965&#13;
and changes in literacy, urbanization, life expectancy, and income per capita&#13;
over the decade. The estimated contribution of family planning program effort&#13;
to fertility deline varies with -the specification of the regression equation,&#13;
although all models find statistically significant effects of program effort&#13;
on fertility. A high estimate implies that, for a typical country&#13;
experiencing the average amount of socioeconomic change from 1965 to 1975 and&#13;
the average expansion of family planning program effort, fertility decline&#13;
prior to 1965 accounted for 33 percent of fertility decline from 1965 to 1975,&#13;
socioeconomic change 27 percent,and family planning effort 40 percent.&#13;
Studies of the effects of contraceptive availability on contraceptive&#13;
use and fertility within countries are of three types: (1) comparisons of&#13;
contraceptive use among women by knowledge of source of supply; (2) analysis&#13;
of differentials in contraceptive use or fertility among population sub-groups&#13;
having differential access to family planning services or differential&#13;
exposure to family planning inputs; and (3) controlled experiments assessing&#13;
the impacts of alternative contraceptive delivery systems. A review of these&#13;
three types of studies provides overwhelming support for the hypothesis that&#13;
increased availability of contraceptive supplies results in increased&#13;
contraceptive use and fertility decline. While some studies show that&#13;
increased accessibility has effects on contraceptive use and fertility even at&#13;
very low levels of social and economic development, the review also concludes&#13;
that there is little evidence on the distributional consequences of increased&#13;
access to family planning services and the socioeconomic circumstances under&#13;
which family planning inputs would have the greatest marginal impact on&#13;
contraceptive use and fertility decline.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
Access to modern methods of contraception differs greatly among&#13;
developing countries and within developing countries. In Nepal in 1976, only&#13;
6 percent of currently married women knew of an outlet for contraceptive&#13;
supplies; and, of those who knew of an outlet, only about 40 percent reported&#13;
that the outlet was within two hours of their residence (Rodriguez 1978). In&#13;
the same year in Costa Rica, nearly 90 percent of women knew of a source of&#13;
supplies; and, of those who knew of a source, about 80 percent indicated that&#13;
the source was located within thirty minutes of their home. In urban areas of&#13;
Costa Rica, nearly all women resided within thirty minutes of an outlet, but&#13;
only 60 percent of women living in rural areas had comparable accessibility&#13;
(Rodriguez 1978). A component of most conventional family planning programs&#13;
is increasing accessibility to, and availability of, contraceptive supplies.&#13;
Increasing availability lowers the information and travel costs of obtaining&#13;
contraception. The purpose of this paper is to review evidence on the effects&#13;
of increased accessibility or availability on contraceptive use and fertility.&#13;
Section II of this paper describes an economic model of the demand for&#13;
contraception and the demand for children and shows how reductions in the&#13;
costs of contraception can be expected to increase contraceptive use and&#13;
decrease fertility. The model provides a framework for interpreting past&#13;
empirical research on these issues. Section III provides estimates of the&#13;
effects of the expansion of national family planning programs on fertility&#13;
decline in developing countries over the 1965-1975 decade, derived from cross-&#13;
national data. Section IV examines studies of the effects of increased&#13;
accessibility within countries, and Section V summarizes the results of family&#13;

availability on contraceptive use and fertility. Section VI is a conclusion.&#13;
II. Theory&#13;
In order to provide a framework for examining empirical work on the&#13;
effects of improved access to contraceptive methods on contraceptive use and&#13;
fertility, I develop in this section a simple one-period model of the demand&#13;
for children and demand for contraception by couples who have achieved a given&#13;
stage in the life cycle (for example, duration of marriage). The model,&#13;
described in more detail in an Appendix, is similar to one examined by&#13;
Rosenzweig and Seiver (1982).&#13;
The household is characterized by a fixed level of wife's schooling and&#13;
a level of excess (or deficit) fertility, representing deviations from optimal&#13;
planned fertility in previous periods. The household derives satisfaction&#13;
from live births in the planning period and from other commodities consumed by&#13;
household members. Community norms and other characteristics of the&#13;
environment in which the couple resides may affect the couple's preferences&#13;
for additional children compared to other goods. The gain in satisfaction&#13;
from an additional birth is inversely related to the level of excess&#13;
fertility. That is, a couple having more children than it had planned to have&#13;
at a given point in the life cycle will derive less satisfaction from an&#13;
additional birth than a couple having just the number it had planned or having&#13;
fewer children than planned, other things being equal. Excess fertility is&#13;
assumed to be inversely related to wife's schooling and positively related to&#13;
fecundity and to the price (or availability) of contraception in previous&#13;
periods. These assumptions are plausible if women with more schooling and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
users of contraception have better control over the variance of fertility for&#13;
a given level of fecundity (Rosenzweig and Seiver 1982, p. 174).&#13;
The household is assumed to maximize satisfaction subject to a budget&#13;
constraint which equates expenditure on additional children, contraception,&#13;
and other goods to full income. Prices (or costs) of children,&#13;
contraceptives, and other goods include the time costs of purchasing and&#13;
consuming goods. It is assumed that the price of contraception is inversely&#13;
related to wife's schooling on the hypothesis that women with more schooling&#13;
have lower information costs about sources of supply or, alternatively, have&#13;
greater efficiency in contraceptive use, so that the number of births averted&#13;
per unit of contraception is greater for more educated women. Finally, it is&#13;
assumed that more educated women have higher values of time, so that the price&#13;
of children is greater for such women.&#13;
The necessary condition for maximizing satisfaction subject to the full&#13;
income constraint is that, at the margin, the amount of other goods the couple&#13;
is willing to give up for another child in terms of satisfaction equals the&#13;
amount of other goods it must give up to have another child, where this latter&#13;
amount equals the ratio of the net price of a child to the price of other&#13;
goods. The net price of a child equals the full price of a child, including&#13;
time costs, minus savings in contraceptive costs from having another birth.&#13;
That is, if a couple decides to have an additional birth, then it need not use&#13;
contraception for a period of time, so that the expenditures resulting from&#13;
the decision to have an additional child are less than direct expenditures on&#13;
the child. Savings in contraceptive costs are positively related to the price&#13;
of contraceptives and negatively related to the efficiency of contraception&#13;
(that is, the number of births averted per unit of contraception). Put&#13;
another way, if contraceptives were relatively expensive and not very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
efficient, then a couple deciding to have an additional birth would have&#13;
considerable savings in expenditures on contraception.&#13;
Solving for the first order conditions for a maximum yields demand&#13;
equations for contraceptives (C) and number of births (n):&#13;
C = C(Pc(S),Pn (S),Pz,F,n,X(n,S,p),E)           (1)&#13;
n = n(Pc(S),PS),Pz F,n,X(n,S,p),E)              (2)&#13;
where Pct Pn and Pz are the full prices of contraceptives, children, and other&#13;
goods, respectively; F is full income; n is the number of births the couple&#13;
would have in the absence of contraception (fecundity); X is excess fertility;&#13;
S is years of wife's schooling; p is the full price of contraceptives in&#13;
previous periods; and E is a vector of variables influencing preferences for&#13;
children compared to other goods. Equations (1) and (2) show that the demand&#13;
for contraception and the demand for children depend on the same variables.&#13;
Since couples only use contraception to reduce the number of births per&#13;
period, the demand for contraception and the demand for children respond in&#13;
opposite directions to changes in prices, income, or other variables. For&#13;
example, if the number of births demanded decreases when the price of children&#13;
increases, then the demand for contraception is positively related to the&#13;
price of children. I now describe the predicted effects of changes in various&#13;
variables on the demands for contraception and for children. A fuller&#13;
description is contained in the appendix.&#13;
A reduction in the price of contraceptives (or improvement in access)&#13;
has two effects on the quantity of children demanded. The first effect is a&#13;
substitution effect which induces the couple to increase the quantity of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
contraceptives used and to reduce the number of births. The second influence&#13;
of a price reduction is an income effect. That is, the fall in the price of&#13;
contraceptives raises full income and thus may induce the couple to buy more&#13;
or fewer contraceptives. There are no direct estimates of the influence of&#13;
increased income on contraceptive use, but the direction of the effect can be&#13;
inferred from estimates of the effect of income on the demand for children.&#13;
There are numerous estimates of the effect of increases in income on the&#13;
demand for children in developing countries. Most estimates, although not all&#13;
(Boulier 1982), suggest a small negative impact of increased income on&#13;
fertility (at least above very low levels of income), implying that&#13;
contraceptive use increases with income. Hence, the effect of increased&#13;
income on the demand for contraception resulting from a decrease in the price&#13;
of contraception augments the substitution effect. Since, however, the&#13;
influence of income on the demand for children is small, and since&#13;
expenditures on contraception constitute only a small fraction of income&#13;
(Lewis 1983), this income effect is likely to be small.&#13;
The foregoing discussion suggests that the demand for children is&#13;
positively related to the price of contraception (and thus inversely to its&#13;
availability). Modest support for this conjecture is shown in data gathered&#13;
by the World Fertility Survey (WFS) and the Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys&#13;
(CPS). The proportion of married women aged thirty to thirty-nine wanting&#13;
more children is generally lower for women residing in locations where&#13;
contraceptive supplies are more readily available. For example, in Mexico in&#13;
1978, only one-fifth of women aged thirty to thirty-nine who state that a&#13;
source of supply is within twenty-five minutes of their residence want&#13;
additional children compared to one-quarter of women who know only of a&#13;
distant source and two-fifths of women knowing no source. This evidence is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
only suggestive, however, since other variables which jointly determine family&#13;
size and availability, such as income and education, may lurk behind this&#13;
correlation and since women who want more children have less incentive to&#13;
search for a source of supply (see Section IV). Controlling for location of&#13;
residence, education, and knowledge of source does not eliminate the&#13;
differences for most countries. (Focusing only on reports of women who know&#13;
of a source reduces the bias resulting from the fact that women wanting no&#13;
more children are more likely to search for a source.) Among Mexican women&#13;
with lower primary education residing in urban areas, 27 percent of those who&#13;
state that supply sources are nearby want additional children compared to 36&#13;
percent of women who know only of distant sources and 37 percent of women who&#13;
know of no source. The corresponding percentages for rural women with lower&#13;
primary education are 33 percent, 42 percent, and 52 percent, respectively.&#13;
Among women aged thirty to thirty-nine who know of a nearby source, the&#13;
percentage wanting more children is lower than the corresponding percentage&#13;
among women who know only of a distant source in ten of fifteen countries for&#13;
which information is available.&#13;
An important implication of the hypothesis that the demand for children&#13;
is inversely related to the price of contraceptives is that empirical&#13;
estimates of the availability on contraceptive use which hold constant some&#13;
measure of the demand for children (for example, desire for additional&#13;
children) will understate the impact of increased availability on&#13;
contraceptive use. Several of these studies are summarized in Section IV&#13;
below.&#13;
I now turn to the predicted effects of other determinants of&#13;
contraceptive use and fertility. An increase in the price of children is&#13;
expected to decrease the demand for children and to increase contraceptive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
use. Couples having excess fertility (higher levels of X) are expected to&#13;
want fewer additional births and to use more contraception.&#13;
The influence of wife's schooling on the demand for contraceptives is&#13;
complex. On the one hand, if increased schooling is associated with a lower&#13;
price of contraception and a higher price of children, then a rise in&#13;
schooling increases the demand for contraception. On the other hand,&#13;
schooling may affect the timing of fertility. To the extent that women with&#13;
more schooling have lower excess fertility at any point in their life cycle,&#13;
they will have smaller demand for contraception than women with less&#13;
schooling, other things being equal. For empirical evidence on this point,&#13;
see Rosenzweig and Seiver (1982). The impact of schooling on contraceptive&#13;
use is thus a priori unpredictable and is therefore an empirical question.&#13;
Microeconomic studies of the demand for children generally reveal a negative&#13;
association between wife's schooling and fertility, at least above low levels&#13;
of education (Cochrane 1979; Boulier 1982), implying that the demand for&#13;
contraception is ordinarily positively associated with schooling, other things&#13;
being equal.&#13;
The effect of increased fecundity (n) on contraceptive use cannot be&#13;
predicted a priori. Fertility will be positively related to fecundity unless&#13;
contraceptive use rises with increased fecundity and unless births averted per&#13;
contraceptive is sufficiently large.&#13;
Because women who faced high prices for contraception in the past (o)&#13;
have higher levels of excess fertility in the present, extending services&#13;
to couples who formerly did not have ready access to contraception is likely&#13;
to result in greater increases in contraceptive use than improvements in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54*-&#13;
access for couples who already face relatively low prices for contra-&#13;
ceptives. It is also possible that increased availability of contraception&#13;
may shift the timing of fertility in the life cycle. Older couples having&#13;
faced relatively high prices for effective contraception in the past are&#13;
likely to have engaged in measures such as postponment of age at marriage,&#13;
reduced coital frequency, and prolonged lactation in order to avoid excess&#13;
fertility in the future. Young couples having ready access to effective&#13;
contraception do not have the same incentive to delay childbearing. In fact,&#13;
it is quite possible that fertility of young women will rise with increased&#13;
availability. For example, Schultz (1971) reports that the marginal&#13;
contribution of family planning workers in Taiwan diminished considerably as&#13;
the duration of the national family planning program increased. While&#13;
fertility of young women declined in response to family planning inputs in the&#13;
early years of the program, within five years of the initiation of the program&#13;
there was a positive association at the district level between cumulative&#13;
family planning inputs and the age-specific fertility rates of women aged&#13;
fifteen to nineteen, Rindfuss and Morgan (1983) find that the probability&#13;
that a couple conceives in the first three months of marriage among women not&#13;
pregnant at the time of marriage has increased significantly in Taiwan and&#13;
Korea and among the Chinese population of Malaysia. They attribute the&#13;
increase to greater coital frequency among young couples and hypothesize that&#13;
the increase in coital frequency is explained by a rising share of romantic&#13;
versus arranged marriages in these countries. An alternative explanation is&#13;
simply that increased contraceptive availability lessens the need to delay&#13;
childbearing.&#13;
Finally, changes in environmental variables such as community norms&#13;
influencing preferences for children and other goods may influence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
contraceptive use. If, for example, policies to persuade couples of the&#13;
desirability of small families were successful, then contraceptive use would&#13;
rise. If exposure to modernization raises the satisfaction for goods relative&#13;
to children (Freedman, et. al. 1981), then contraceptive use would be expected&#13;
to rise.&#13;
The remainder of this paper examines evidence on the association between&#13;
availability of, or access to, family planning services and contraceptive use&#13;
and fertility.&#13;
III. National Family Planning Programs&#13;
A Review of Previous Research&#13;
In recent years, there have been numerous attempts to assess the&#13;
contribution of national family planning programs to fertility decline.&#13;
Approaches to measuring program effects relevant to assessing the impact of&#13;
contraceptive availability on fertility decline include comparisons of&#13;
fertility declines within countries before and after program intervention&#13;
(United Nations, 1978 and 1982) and cross-sectional studies of fertility&#13;
levels and changes in fertility levels in countries with programs and those&#13;
without (see studies reviewed below). None of these types of studies is ideal&#13;
for assessing the effects of increased contraceptive availability on&#13;
conraceptive use or fertility.&#13;
Time series data for a single country are usually not adequate to allow&#13;
separation of the influence of the introduction of the national family&#13;
planning program on fertility decline from other factors influencing fertility&#13;
change, such as growth in per capita income or improvement in female employ-&#13;
ment opportunities. The second category of studies has the advantage that one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
can control for the influences of socioeconomic change on fertility, but is&#13;
not directly a test of the effect of increased accessibility on use or&#13;
fertility, since national programs typically have many more components than&#13;
distribution of contraceptives. In this section, I review briefly previous&#13;
research in this latter category and present the results of an empirical&#13;
analysis of family planning program effort on fertility decline in sixty-eight&#13;
less-developed countries.&#13;
The most influential paper in the literature on the contribution of&#13;
national family planning programs to fertility decline is one by Mauldin and&#13;
Berelson (1978). Later work on this topic is very often a critique or&#13;
extension of this early piece of research. Given the importance of this&#13;
paper, I begin this section with a summary and critique of it. Findings of&#13;
other studies are indicated as appropriate.&#13;
The Mauldin-Berelson paper, hereafter MB, examines the correlates of&#13;
fertility decline in ninety-four developing countries over the period 1965-&#13;
1975. The main purpose of the paper is to determine how much of the fertility&#13;
decline over this period is associated with socioeconomic change and how much&#13;
can be attributed to population policies and programs. While their overall&#13;
discussion of the sources of fertility change is sophisticated, the procedure&#13;
for estimating the relative influences of socioeconomic change and family&#13;
planning programs on fertility change is quite simple. First, MB constructed&#13;
a data file of variables expected to influence the demand for children,&#13;
including indicators of education of parents and children, health, economic&#13;
status, and status of women. They then selected for the final analysis a set&#13;
of variables having high zero order correlations with percentage declines in&#13;
the crude birth rate. Variables selected on the basis of relevance to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
fertility decline (that is, high zero order correlations), subject to data&#13;
availability, were the following:&#13;
1.   Adult literacy (ages 15 and over),&#13;
2.   Primary and secondary school enrollment as a percentage&#13;
of the 5-19 group,&#13;
3.   Life expectancy at birth,&#13;
4.   Infant mortality rate,&#13;
5.   Percentage of adult males in nonagricultural labor force,&#13;
6.   GNP per captia, and&#13;
7.   Percentage of population living in cities of more than&#13;
100,000.&#13;
They were unable to find satisfactory measures of the status of women for a&#13;
sufficiently large sample of countries. For the sample of countries for which&#13;
such data were available, variables such as percentage of women enrolled in&#13;
primary of secondary school, adult female literacy rates, and nonagricultural&#13;
employment of women were highly correlated with other indicators of&#13;
development (MB 1978, pp. 139-141), leading them to speculate that their&#13;
estimate of the impact of family planning programs would be unaffected by the&#13;
inclusion of variables reflecting women's status. MB note that the&#13;
socioeconomic variables included in their analysis may either represent true&#13;
causes of fertlity decline or may just be surrogates for underlying causal&#13;
forces (MB 1978, pp, 99-100).&#13;
To capture the influence of family planning programs, they constructed&#13;
an index of family planning effort derived from data collected by Lapham and&#13;
Mauldin (1972). These data consist of values for fifteen characteristics of&#13;
national population policy for each country. The characteristics are given in&#13;

its own resources&#13;

two points were awarded if the criterion were scored yes, one point if scored&#13;
a qualified yes, and zero points if partially yes or no. Points were added to&#13;
form an index ranging from zero to thirty. While one can quarrel with the&#13;
particular criteria and implicit weighting that assigns equal value to each,&#13;
it is reasonable to suppose that the index is sufficiently correlated with&#13;
effort so that minor adjustments would not be likely to alter significantly&#13;
findings of the empirical analysis. Since values of the individual categories&#13;
of the index for each country are not available, it is not possible to&#13;
determine which components of programs are most important for inducing&#13;
fertility decline in particular socioeconomic settings.&#13;
To allocate the relative influences of socioeconomic change and program&#13;
effort on fertility change, the authors regress various fertility measures on&#13;
socioeconomic variables, then on the effort index, and finally on both sets of&#13;
variables. The values of the R2 are used to partition the influence of the&#13;
variables on birth rate decline. The procedure can be illustrated with the&#13;
regressions using the percentage decline in the birth rate from 1965 to 1975&#13;
as the dependent variable and values of the socioeconomic variables for&#13;
1970. The R2 for the seven socioeconomic indicators alone is .66, for the&#13;
effort index alone is .78, and for both sets of variables together is .83.&#13;
From an analysis of the effects of proximate determinants of the crude birth&#13;
rate, MB conclude that about 55-70 percent of the 1965-1975 crude birth rate&#13;
decline is the result of declining marital fertility (MB 1978, p. 122). Using&#13;
the R2 values from the reported regresions, they conclude that 40 to 45&#13;
percent (= .66 x [55 to 70 percent]) of the decline in crude birth rate over&#13;
this decade was attributable to changes induced by improvements in social&#13;
setting and only about 10 to 15 percent (= [.83 - .66] x [55 to 70 percent])&#13;
was the result of organized family planning programs. Hernandez (1981, p.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
632) reports an even smaller effect, about 4 to 6 percent, these lower figures&#13;
being obtained by adding variables for island status, pace of social change,&#13;
and 1970 population density to the set of variables characterizing social&#13;
setting.&#13;
This procedure for allocating the relative influences of socioeconomic&#13;
variables and family planning effort on fertility decline is incorrect, as can&#13;
be seen in the following example. The MB allocation procedure assumes that&#13;
the influence of family planning is added onto the influence of social&#13;
setting. An alternative approach would be to give primacy to family planning&#13;
effort and to add the influence of social setting variables. If this approach&#13;
were taken, one would estimate that family planning effort would account for&#13;
43-54 percent (= .78 x [55 to 70 percent]) of the decline in the crude birth&#13;
rate and social setting only 3-4 percent (= [.83 - .78] x [55 to 70&#13;
percent]). This second decomposition gives a much different picture of the&#13;
influence of family planning effort. However, neither is correct. Since&#13;
socioeconomic variables and family planning effort are both relevant to&#13;
explaining fertility decline, it is inappropriate to gauge their relative&#13;
importance by contributions to the coefficient of determination (Hendry and&#13;
Marshall, 1983). What is relevant to assessing the impact of programs is the&#13;
magnitude and statistical significance of the coefficient of the family&#13;
planning variable, not its influence on R2. Unfortunately, MB do not present&#13;
the unstandardized regression coefficients which would enable one to estimate&#13;
directly the contribution of family planning programs in this way.&#13;
In addition to the regression analysis, MB present a 4x4 table in which&#13;
countries are cross-classified by level of program effort and by an index of&#13;
social setting (MB 1978, Table 12, p. 110). Countries having scores of 20+ on&#13;
the family planning index are denoted as having strong programs, 10-19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
moderate programs, and 0-9 as weak programs. The final category is countries&#13;
which have no program. Countries are also ranked by an index of social&#13;
setting, this index being constructed by summing the ranks of countries for&#13;
each of the seven socioeconomic variables. Table 2 is a condensed version of&#13;
their Table 12. Of twenty-three countries having both high or upper middle&#13;
social setting and also having strong or moderate programs, the median decline&#13;
in the crude birth rate over the period 1965-1975 is 24 percent. Only El&#13;
Salvador and Iran have declines of less than 15 percent. On the other hand,&#13;
of twenty-five countries ranked as having the same social setting but having a&#13;
weak program or no program at all, the median decline in the crude birth rate&#13;
over the same period is only 4 percent. Only four countries have declines of&#13;
10 percent or more. Three countries are categorized as having lower-middle or&#13;
low social setting but also having a strong or moderate program. The&#13;
percentage decline in these countries are North Vietnam, 23 percent; India, 16&#13;
percent; and Indonesia, 13 percent. The final cell consists of the forty-&#13;
three countries which have lower-middle or low social setting and&#13;
simultaneously have weak programs or no program at all. None of these&#13;
countries has a decline in the crude birth rate of more than 5 percent. There&#13;
are no differences in fertility declines between countries that have weak&#13;
programs or that have no program. If it were the case that the level of&#13;
social setting and the level of family planning effort were independent, that&#13;
is, that a strong family planning program could be exogenously imposed in any&#13;
country, regardless of the level of social setting, then one would conclude&#13;
that family planning program effort has a very large impact on fertility&#13;
decline.&#13;

There is, however, an objection to the hypothesis that the level of&#13;
family planning effort and social setting are truly independent. First, it is&#13;
quite possibly the case that only countries with a relatively high level of&#13;
socioeconomic development can have strong or moderately strong family planning&#13;
programs. The small number of countries with low levels of development that&#13;
have strong or moderate programs suggests that such countries lack admin-&#13;
istrative and other resources to carry out effective programs; either it is&#13;
difficult to organize programs in such environments or there is little demand&#13;
for program services in such settings. Indeed, Demeny (1979) argues that the&#13;
MB approach, also adopted in a similar analysis by Tsui and Bogue (1978) with&#13;
the same conclusions, may well overstate the impact of family planning&#13;
programs relative to the effects of changes in socioeconomic variables, since&#13;
economic development may be necessary before countries can undertake effective&#13;
programs. Path analyses by MB (1979, p, 106) and by Tolnay and Christenson&#13;
(1983) in which the effort index is "explained" in part by socioeconomic&#13;
variables find that the indirect effect of development through its influence&#13;
on program effort is quite large. Kelly and Cutright (1983) also find&#13;
statistically significant correlations between pre-1965 levels of development&#13;
and the magnitude of program effort.&#13;
Demeny (1979) raises two further questions with respect to the MB and&#13;
Tsui-Bogue estimates of the effects of family planning programs on fertility&#13;
decline. First, variables such as female employment opportunities and&#13;
cultural characteristics omitted from the analyses may account jointly for&#13;
fertility decline and program effort. Omission of such variables biases&#13;
upward the estimate of program impact. Second, countries which have&#13;
experienced fertility declines in the past are more likely to devote resources&#13;
to encourage additional reductions in fertility than countries without such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
declines, and would be likely also to experience greater reductions in&#13;
fertility even without family planning programs. Wheeler (1982) and Kelly and&#13;
Cutright (1983) report that pre-program fertility declines are associated with&#13;
higher levels of program effort in 1972. Omission of past trends in fertility&#13;
from the regressions may also lead to an upwardly biased estimate of program&#13;
impact.&#13;
New Estimates of the Effects of National Family&#13;
Planning Programs on Fertility Decline&#13;
To establish the impact of national family plannning programs on&#13;
fertility, I have estimated several statistical models using the data provided&#13;
by MB supplemented with World Bank data on income per capita, crude birth&#13;
rates prior to 1965, total fertility, and expectation of life at birth. Table&#13;
3 gives the definitions and mean values of variables used in the analysis.&#13;
Table 4 presents estimates of the impacts of socioeconomic variables and&#13;
family planning program effort on 1975 levels of the crude birth rate and&#13;
total fertility rate for sixty-eight countries, with independent variables&#13;
measured for the most recent date for which they were available. Regressions&#13;
including lagged values of fertilty are also shown. Specifications including&#13;
lagged variables are appropriate either if current levels of fertility depend&#13;
not only upon current levels of independent variables but also on their past&#13;
values or if fertility adjusts only slowly to changes in environmental&#13;
variables (incuding family planning effort) (Johnston, 1972, pp. 300-303).&#13;
Inclusion of past fertility in the equation also helps to control for the&#13;
influence of variables affecting fertility but omitted from the regression.&#13;
Variables such as infant mortality and the proportion not employed in&#13;
agriculture are highly linearly correlated with other socioeconomic variables&#13;
and are not available for all countries at earlier dates. The coefficient of&#13;
the duration of the program (that is, 1975 minus the date at which the program&#13;

began) is not statistically significant in part because there is a very high&#13;
correlation between the duration of the program and its level of effort in&#13;
1972. Estimates of the coefficients of the effort variable in the 1975 cross-&#13;
section regressions are not affected by the exclusion of these other&#13;
variables.&#13;
The estimated crude birth rate equation without lagged fertility&#13;
suggests that crude birth rates are negatively associated with literacy,&#13;
urbanization, and island status, and that fertility is higher in predominantly&#13;
Catholic or Moslem countries. The coefficient of SCORE, the index of family&#13;
planning program effectiveness, is highly statistically significantly&#13;
different from zero and implies that a one-point increase in its value reduces&#13;
the crude birth rate by one-half point. Adding the 1965 crude birth rate to&#13;
the equation reduces the absolute magnitudes of all coefficients, including&#13;
that of SCORE. Only the coefficients of SCORE and lagged fertility are&#13;
statistically significant. The coefficient of the lagged value of the crude&#13;
birth rate indicates that countries having a one-point higher crude birth rate&#13;
in 1965 have birth rates higher by one point in 1975, other things being&#13;
equal. When the total fertility rate is the dependent variable and its lagged&#13;
value is omitted from the equation, all coefficients have the same sign that&#13;
they do in the crude birth rate equation, although only the coefficients of&#13;
island status and the dummy variable for Islamic countries are statistically&#13;
significant. When the 1965 total fertility rate is added to the equation, the&#13;
coefficients of SCORE and adult literacy become significantly different from&#13;
zero. Countries having higher fertility rates in 1965 have higher fertility&#13;
rates in 1975, other things being equal, but the coefficient of lagged total&#13;
fertility is less than one. The coefficient of SCORE in the regression&#13;
implies that a one-point increase in the effectiveness of the family planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
program reduces total fertility by .05 points. The estimated impact of family&#13;
planning effort is small but not negligible. For example, the estimated&#13;
coefficient implies that if Ecuador (SCORE = 6) had a program effort&#13;
comparable to that of Colombia (SCORE = 16), then total fertility would have&#13;
been 5.9 in 1975 rather than 6.4.&#13;
Several additional regression specifications were estimated.&#13;
Interaction terms involving the products of program effectiveness and socio-&#13;
economic variables were included in all of the above equations to see whether&#13;
the contribution of family planning programs to fertility decline varied with&#13;
the level of development. None of the coefficients was statistically&#13;
significant individually, nor was the set of coefficients taken as a whole.&#13;
At face value, this result would imply that the contribution of family&#13;
planning programs to fertility decline is independent of development level.&#13;
However, it should be remembered that the sample of countries having low&#13;
levels of development and effective family planning programs is very small, so&#13;
that there may not be sufficient variation in the interaction terms to detect&#13;
variations in the impact of family planning programs with development&#13;
level. In other experiments, the squared value of the effectiveness variable&#13;
was introduced into the equations. No evidence of diminishing marginal&#13;
returns to program effort was discovered. However, given that SCORE is formed&#13;
by assigning an arbitrary number of points to categories which may or may not&#13;
have equal impact on fertility decline, it is not clear that the failure to&#13;
find nonlinearities means that there are no diminishing returns to family&#13;
planning inputs.&#13;

is that the program score was zero in 1965. This assumption is not exactly&#13;
correct, since a small number of countries had programs in 1965, some of which&#13;
were quite effective (for example, Taiwan and Hong Kong). Omission of these&#13;
countries from the sample does not change the results. Aside from providing&#13;
an additional estimate of the 1975 equations, there are two further advantages&#13;
of first difference equations compared to those estimated from a single cross-&#13;
section. First, variables influencing fertility omitted from the 1975&#13;
equations but which are unchanged over the decade within a country will not&#13;
enter the first difference equation, thus permitting sharper estimates of the&#13;
impacts of measured variables on fertility. Second, first difference&#13;
equations are likely to reduce the consequences of measurement errors in&#13;
independent variables. For example, if the definition of literacy differs&#13;
across countries, then the level of literacy as measured in one country may&#13;
not be comparable with the level as measured in another. Nonetheless,&#13;
measured increases in the level of literacy over time might be quite&#13;
comparable.&#13;
Two first difference equations for each fertility variable are shown in&#13;
Table 5. These equations correspond to the equations shown in Table 4, with&#13;
one set including lagged values of fertility change. Changes in fertility&#13;
over the five year period 1960 to 1965 are included in the equations rather&#13;
than changes over the decade preceding 1965 in order not to restrict the&#13;
sample size. Accurate estimates of fertility in 1955 are not available for&#13;
most countries. There are four interesting findings in these equations.&#13;
First, with the exception of the coefficient of urbanization in the total&#13;
fertility equations, only the coefficients of program effort and lagged&#13;
fertility change are statistically significant at conventional levels.&#13;
Increases in urbanization and life expectancy are associated with fertility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
decline. Increases in incomes per capita are associated with increases in the&#13;
crude birth rate but declines in the total fertility rate. With the exception&#13;
of the total fertility rate equation including lagged fertility changes, the&#13;
coefficients of literacy are positive. Second, as suggested by Demeny (1979),&#13;
countries experiencing declines in fertility in the past have declines in&#13;
fertility in the future, other things being equal. Third, the coefficients of&#13;
the program effort variables in the crude birth rate equations are nearly&#13;
identical to those shown in Table 4, while the coefficient of SCORE in the&#13;
total fertility equation excluding lagged fertility change is nearly twice the&#13;
magnitude of the corresponding coefficient in Table 4, although its&#13;
coefficient in the equation including lagged fertility change is somewhat&#13;
smaller than in the corresponding Table 4 equation. Including past changes in&#13;
fertility reduces considerably the estimated impacts of program effort. For&#13;
example, the total fertility rate equation excluding lagged fertility implies&#13;
that if Ecuador had attained a SCORE of 16 (the level of Colombia) rather than&#13;
6, then its total fertility rate would have declined by 1.1 points from 1965&#13;
to 1975 instead of its actual decline of .5 points. The total fertility rate&#13;
equation including lagged fertility predicts a decline of only .8 points from&#13;
this expanded effort compared to the actual decline of .5 points. Fourth,&#13;
variables included in the equations account for a substantial proportion of&#13;
the variance of fertility change over the decade. Alternative specifications&#13;
including interaction terms between program effort and socio-economic changes&#13;
did not reveal any evidence that program effectiveness was enhanced or reduced&#13;
with changes in development nor was there any evidence of diminishing marginal&#13;
returns to program effort.&#13;
Also shown in Table 5 are simultaneous equation estimates of the&#13;
fertility rate equations with SCORE treated as an endogenous variable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
Statistical identification of the SCORE coefficient in the fertility rate&#13;
equation is obtained by (somewhat arbitrarily) permitting values of&#13;
socioeconomic variables in 1965 and earlier to affect SCORE but not&#13;
fertility. The OLS estimates of the SCORE equation corresponding to the two-&#13;
stage least squares (2SLS) estimates of the total fertility rate equation is:&#13;

2&#13;
R  = .71       n = 68           (standard errors in parentheses)&#13;
Coefficient estimates in an equation containing lagged values of the crude&#13;
birth rate change are similar. Lagged fertility change, literacy, and island&#13;
status stand out as statistically significant and important determinants of&#13;
SCORE. A decline in the total fertility rate by one-half point over the&#13;
period 1960-1965 raises SCORE by nearly 5 points. As suggested by Demeny, it&#13;
seems plausible to suppose that fertility decline induces government officials&#13;
to augment resources for encouraging further fertility reduction. Other&#13;
things being equal, a country having a 10 percent higher level of literacy in&#13;
1960 (i.e., an increase in the proportion literate by .10) has a one-point&#13;
higher score and each additional 10 percent increase in the literacy rate from&#13;
1960 to 1970 raises SCORE by 2 points. Other things being equal, islands have&#13;
scores nearly 5 points higher than countries that are not islands. Each 10&#13;
year increment in the expectation of life over the 1965-1975 decade raises&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
SCORE by about 2.5 points. Both the initial level of income per capi7ta and&#13;
subsequent increases in income per capita are negatively associated with&#13;
SCORE. Predominantly Catholic countries have lower scores than other&#13;
countries as do Moslem countries, but the coefficient of Islamic status is&#13;
extremely small.&#13;
The coefficients of socioeconomic variables in the 2SLS crude birth rate&#13;
and total fertility rate equations differ little from the OLS coefficients;&#13;
the 2SLS estimates of the coefficients of lagged fertility change are slightly&#13;
smaller than the corresponding OLS coefficients. The 2SLS estimates of the&#13;
coefficients of SCORE are somewhat larger (in absolute value) than the OLS&#13;
estimates. Given the rather arbitrary procedures used to identify the&#13;
fertility rate equation, it is not clear that the simultaneous equation&#13;
estimates are to be preferred to the OLS estimates.&#13;
In sum, all estimated equations show statistically significant effects&#13;
of family planning program effort on fertility decline. Ordinary least&#13;
squares estimates of coefficients of effort in the crude birth rate and total&#13;
fertility rate equations estimated with 1975 cross-section data with a&#13;
specification including the lagged value of fertility rates do not differ&#13;
appreciably from those obtained using first differences over the period 1965&#13;
to 1975. Taking into account past levels of fertility or fertility change&#13;
markedly reduces the estimated impact of program effort. Socioeconomic&#13;
characteristics of a country and past levels of fertility change influence the&#13;
index of family planning effort. A crude attempt to take into account the&#13;
influence of socioeconomic variables on the level of family planning effort&#13;
raised slightly the estimated impact of effort on fertility decline. In all&#13;
cases, the estimated influence of program effort on fertility decline is&#13;
rather small. If it could be assumed that program effort could be exogenously&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
imposed on a country, the estimates imply that increasing SCORE from (say) 0&#13;
to 18 points, the median level of program effort among countries with a&#13;
positive score, would on average reduce the crude birth rate by six to seven&#13;
points and would reduce the total fertility rate by one-half to three-quarters&#13;
of a point. This small contribution of fertility decline may not be&#13;
insignificant, however. An estimate of the contribution of family planning&#13;
effort to fertility decline in the sixty-eight countries included in the&#13;
sample can be made by using equation (5) in Table 5 to decompose the sources&#13;
of fertility change over the decade 1965 to 1975. During this period, the&#13;
total fertility rate declined by an average of one-half point in sample&#13;
countries. For a hypothetical country experiencing the average increases in&#13;
literacy, urbanization, life expectancy, and income per capita over the decade&#13;
and attaining a SCORE of only 7.2, the average level of effort in 1972, 33&#13;
percent of the fertility decline is attributable to fertility reduction prior&#13;
to 1965, only 27 percent to the direct effects of socioeconomic change, and&#13;
fully 40 percent to family planning effort. This estimate is of course an&#13;
upper bound estimate, since it ignores the effects of previous fertility&#13;
decline and socioeconomic change as they may have influenced levels of effort.&#13;
In short, cross country analysis of the influence of family planning&#13;
program activity on fertility change suggests that program effort may have had&#13;
an important influence in bringing about fertility decline. As this section&#13;
demonstrates, however, it is extremely difficult to separate the influence of&#13;
program effort from the effects of demographic and socioeconomic change on&#13;
fertility at the national level. Moreover, the aggregate index of program&#13;
effort used in the empirical analysis does not allow one to estimate those&#13;
components of program activity which contribute most toward fertility decline.&#13;

IV. Evidence on the Effects of Availability, Contraceptive&#13;
Uses, and Fertility: Within Country Studies&#13;
Several studies have used data on either individuals or on areas within&#13;
countries to investigate the effects of accessibility or availability on&#13;
contraceptive use. Relatively little work has been done on the relation of&#13;
accessibility to fertility decline. Comparison of results across studies is&#13;
rendered difficult because of differing measures of accessibility and&#13;
differing techniques for assessing the effects of accessibility on use or&#13;
fertility. In what follows, I summarize first the findings relating to&#13;
contraceptive use and then those pertaining to fertility.&#13;
World Fertility Survey (WFS) and Contraceptive Prevalence Survey (CPS)&#13;
data have been used to estimate the influence of accessibility on&#13;
contraceptive use in several countries. In some of the WFS data sets, women&#13;
were asked if they knew of a source where they could go to obtain family&#13;
planning information, services, and supplies. Those who responded positively&#13;
were asked about travel time to nearest source. This question was selected to&#13;
measure accessibility on the basis of experiments conducted by Rodriguez&#13;
(1977), who found that respondents were better able to estimate travel time&#13;
than distance to a family planning outlet. CPS also relied upon respondents'&#13;
estimates of travel time. Thus, these surveys provide two measures of&#13;
availability: (1) whether or not women know of an outlet and (2) self-reported&#13;
estimates of travel time for women who do know of an outlet. Neither of these&#13;
variables measures actual proximity to sources of supply nor prices of&#13;
contraceptive supplies at the source, so that one must be cautious in&#13;
interpreting findings of studies based on these measures of availability. For&#13;
example, actual availability presumably increases both the fraction of women&#13;
who know of an outlet and contraceptive use. On the other hand, women who are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
highly motivated to restrict fertility are more likely to search for, and thus&#13;
to know of, a source for family planning services and to use those services&#13;
compared to women who are less highly motivated (Cornelius and Novak 1983,&#13;
p.4). Cornelius and Novak cite as evidence for this association the findings&#13;
of Chidambaram and Mastropoalo (1981) that the proportion of women wanting no&#13;
more children is higher among women who know of an outlet than among women&#13;
without such knowledge. Of course, this association may merely reflect the&#13;
fact that desired family sizes may be reduced when contraceptive services are&#13;
more readily available, as is suggested in Section II of this paper. Since&#13;
most studies reviewed below hold constant desired for additional children when&#13;
the effects of availability on contraceptive use are examined, it is quite&#13;
possible that effects of availability on use are understated if availability&#13;
causally affects desired fertility. However, to the extent that women more&#13;
highly motivated to reduce fertility are more likely to know of sources of&#13;
contraceptive supply, then there is an upward bias in the estimated impact of&#13;
increased accessibility on use when subjective estimates of availability are&#13;
used to measure actual availability. Cornelius and Novak (1983, p.5) also&#13;
report that "some of the geography literature has suggested that those&#13;
motivated to use a particular product or service may understate the distance&#13;
or travel time to obtain that product or service." If this hypothesis were&#13;
true, then users would understate travel time relative to non-users, biasing&#13;
upwards the estimate of accessibility on use. Cornelius and Novak (1982, p.5)&#13;
note, however, that Rodriguez (1977) and Kamnuansilya and Chamatrithiring&#13;
(1981) have found fairly close agreement between perceived traveL time and&#13;
actual travel time obtained from community level data. Finally, to the extent&#13;
that decreases in travel time and the recent government provision of family&#13;
planning services and prices of government supplies are below those of private&#13;
suppliers (Lewis 1983), it is unclear whether the measured effect of proximity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
to sources is attributable to reduced travel time, reduced money prices of&#13;
contraceptives, or both.&#13;
Rodriguez (1977) was the first to conduct an extensive analysis of the&#13;
relation between perceived availability and contraceptive use with WFS data.&#13;
The countries included in his study and the dates of the surveys were Colombia&#13;
(1976), Costa Rica (1976), Korea (1974), Malaysia (1974), and Nepal (1976).&#13;
Table 6, based on data given in his article, summarizes information on&#13;
knowledge of sources of contraceptive supplies for these five countries. The&#13;
percentage of currently married women knowing of an outlet for contraceptive&#13;
supplies is very high in Costa Rica and Korea, fairly high in Colombia and&#13;
Malaysia, and very low in Nepal. Of those knowing of an outlet, median&#13;
reported travel time is only fifteen minutes in Colombia and Costa Rica,&#13;
twenty minutes in Korea and Malaysia, and two hours in Nepal. In all&#13;
countries, perceived travel times are smaller in urban areas than in rural&#13;
areas. Leaving aside Nepal, over 85 percent of urban women in the other four&#13;
countries knowing of an outlet reported travel times within one-half hour of&#13;
their residence, whereas only 40 percent to 80 percent reported such proximity&#13;
in rural areas. In Nepal, two thirds of urban women knowing of an outlet&#13;
report travel time less than two hours compared to slightly over one third of&#13;
rural women. There are substantial differences in knowledge of source by&#13;
education. Less than 40 percent of women with no education know of a source&#13;
in Colombia; over 90 percent of women with secondary education or higher have&#13;
such knowledge. Differences in knowledge by education of women are smallest&#13;
in Korea, where three-quarters of women with no education know of an outlet&#13;
compared to about nine-tenths of women with secondary education or more.&#13;
Differences by education narrow only slightly, when one controls for marriage&#13;
duration, parity, and urban-rural residence (Rodriguez 1978, Table 2A).&#13;

The percentage of currently married women using an efficient&#13;
contraceptive is much lower for women who do not know of an outlet compared to&#13;
women who do. In Colombia, for example, fewer than 10 percent of women who do&#13;
not know of an outlet use an efficient contraceptive; over 40 percent of women&#13;
knowing of a source use such methods. The relatively high proportion of women&#13;
in Costa Rica who use an efficient method among women who do not know of an&#13;
outlet in part attributable to the fact that many of these women are protected&#13;
by sterilization and thus have little incentive to know of a current source&#13;
for contraceptive services (see the discussion of Pebley and Brackett (1982)&#13;
below.) Among women knowing of a source, the percentage using a method is&#13;
higher the closer they are to the source, but differences by travel time are&#13;
rather small. Adjustment for parity, marriage duration, location of&#13;
residence, education, and desire for additional children almost eliminates&#13;
these differences in prevalence by travel time except in Nepal. Differences&#13;
in use among women who know of a source and women who do not are still&#13;
substantial even after such adjustment. There is essentially no difference in&#13;
use of inefficient methods by reported proximity to source, although women who&#13;
know of an outlet are slightly more likely to use an inefficient method than&#13;
are others (Rodriguez 1978, p. 108). The biggest difference is in Colombia,&#13;
where 14 percent of women reporting knowledge of a source use an inefficient&#13;
method and only 9 percent of other women do so.&#13;
Table 6 also shows the percentage not using an efficient method among&#13;
exposed women who want no more children. In all countries, the fraction of&#13;
nonusers is very high among women not knowing of an outlet except in Costa&#13;
Rica; differences among women with such knowledge by travel time are small&#13;
except in Nepal. Controlling for parity, marriage duration, education, and&#13;
rural-urban residence narrows these differences only slightly. Since the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
fraction not knowing of a source is very small in Costa Rica and Korea, and&#13;
since there is little difference in use among exposed women by proximity to&#13;
source of supply, it is unlikely that expanding availability simply by&#13;
increasing the sources of supply will have much impact on contraceptive use in&#13;
these countries.&#13;
Pebley and Brackett (1982) use WFS data to analyze the relation of&#13;
availability to contraceptive use in seven countries. Their sample adds&#13;
Kenya, Mexico, Panama, and the Philippines to the countries examined by&#13;
Rodriguez but omits Malaysia and Nepal. Chidambaram and Mastropoalo (1981)&#13;
use nearly the same sample as Pebley and Brackett, omitting Panama but&#13;
including Nepal. Since results for Nepal by Rodriguez are reported above and&#13;
since the results of the two latter studies are similar, only the Pebley-&#13;
Brackett findings are summarized here.&#13;
Table 7, constructed from data given by Pebley and Brackett, shows that&#13;
there are substantial differences in use of contraception by women who know of&#13;
an outlet compared to women not knowing an outlet in all countries. Women&#13;
knowing of an outlet are more than twice as likely to be using contraceptives&#13;
as women who do not know of an outlet in all countries except Costa Rica and&#13;
Panama. Adjusting for socio-economic and demographic characteristics,&#13;
including desires for additional children, reduces the differences between&#13;
prevalence rates of women with and without knowledge of an outlet in Colombia,&#13;
Kenya, Korea, and Panama. Differences in the adjusted figures are still&#13;
substantial, however. In Colombia and Korea, prevalence among women knowing&#13;
of an outlet remains more than 30 percent higher than among women not knowing&#13;
an outlet. Similar adjustments do not affect the difference in Costa Rica and&#13;
widen the difference in the Philippines.&#13;

Among women who know of an outlet, the percentage using contraception is&#13;
positively related to the proximity of the source, although differences by&#13;
travel time are small relative to those between women with and without&#13;
knowledge of a source. Pebley and Brackett do not report the differences in&#13;
prevalence by travel time adjusted for other characteristics of the&#13;
household. They state only that differences are statistically significant for&#13;
all countries except Costa Rica and conclude that "travel time makes little&#13;
difference on use, once an outlet is known" (Pebley and Brackett 1982, p. 88).&#13;
Table 8 shows that knowledge of an outlet affects markedly the type of&#13;
contraception used.   Except in Costa Rica, users who know of a source are more&#13;
likely to use modern methods than are women not knowing an outlet.    Kenya is&#13;
an extreme example. Three-fourths of women knowing of an outlet use modern&#13;
methods; only one-fourth of women not knowing of an outlet use modern&#13;
methods. The high proportion of women using modern methods of contraception&#13;
among women not knowing of an outlet in Costa Rica, Korea, and Panama suggests&#13;
that "knowledge of a source" may not be a good measure of actual availability&#13;
in those countries. The percentage of these women protected by sterilization&#13;
is 48 percent in Costa Rica, 51 percent in Korea, and 57 percent in Panama.&#13;
Clearly, women protected by sterilization have little motivation to learn&#13;
current sources for obtaining contraceptives. Were these women removed from&#13;
the category "does not know of an outlet" in Table 8 and added to the users&#13;
maong those who know of an outlet, differences in prevalence by knowledge of&#13;
source of family planning services would be even greater than is already&#13;
shown.&#13;

Table 9 shows the proportion using contraception by knowledge of source&#13;
and travel time for countries in which a Contraceptive Prevalence Survey was&#13;
conducted. As in the WFS data described above, prevalence is much higher&#13;
among women who know of a source than women who do not. For women having&#13;
knowledge of a source, prevalence decreases as travel time increases. Table&#13;
10, constructed from data given in Cornelius and Novak (1983), shows that&#13;
contraceptive prevalence differs only slightly by travel time in urban areas,&#13;
controlling for socio-economic and demographic characteristics of women.&#13;
Proximity to source in rural areas has a larger impact in Colombia and&#13;
Honduras than in Costa Rica and Thailand.&#13;
The influence of actual availability on use has been studied in&#13;
Bangladesh, India, Korea, Mexico, and Thailand. World Fertility Surveys of&#13;
Bangladesh (1976), Korea (1974), and Mexico (1976) gathered information on&#13;
public and private sources of contraceptive supply at the community level.&#13;
Tsui, et al. (1981) matched this community-level data with individual&#13;
records. For Mexico and rural Korea, the number of sources of supply within&#13;
five kilometers of the community was used as a measure of availability.&#13;
Categories used in the analysis for Korea were high (4 or more sources),&#13;
medium (2-3), and low (0-1), and for Mexico high (5-6), medium (3-4), low&#13;
(1-2), and none. For rural Bangladesh, availability was defined as high if an&#13;
outlet was within three miles of the community, medium (4-7 miles), and low (8&#13;
or more miles). Table 11 shows the estimated odds probability of use of any&#13;
type of contraception by availability of supply source with and without&#13;
adjustment for wife's education and an index of community level of&#13;
development. All estimates control for parity and marriage duration. With&#13;

medium and high availability, the estimated net odds of contraceptive use&#13;
increase monotonically with availability. Controlling for wife's education&#13;
and community characteristics reduces differentials in odds of use by level of&#13;
availability considerably in Mexico, but has only minor impact in Bangladesh&#13;
and Korea. The adjusted estimates for Mexico imply that the odds probability&#13;
of use is .77 to 1 for women with no access to family planning services&#13;
compared to 1.34 to 1 for women in high availability areas, an increase in&#13;
odds of use by about 74 percent (that is, 1.34/.77 = 1.74).&#13;
Table 12, taken from the same study, compares continuation rates (that&#13;
is, the percent of ever users who are currently using a method of&#13;
contraception) and percent using effective methods by level of availability.&#13;
In Bangladesh, there is little difference in these measures of contraceptive&#13;
use by proximity of supply. In Korea, continuation rates and percent using&#13;
effective methods are similar in areas of low and medium supply, although both&#13;
measures are much higher in areas with abundant supply sources. In Mexico,&#13;
both measures of contraceptive use are strongly positively related to&#13;
availability. Women residing in areas of abundant supply are over five times&#13;
as likely to be using an effective method of contraception as women located in&#13;
areas without a supply source. Over one-half of ever users are current users&#13;
in areas of high supply; less than 15 percent of ever users are current users&#13;
in areas with no source of supply. Unfortunately, no data are given which&#13;
would show how adjustment for education would affect the estimated association&#13;
between availability and these aspects of contraceptive use.&#13;

(district) health centers, and tambol (subdistrict) health centers. Hospitals&#13;
and amphor centers provide a wider array of methods than do tambol centers,&#13;
and if a district center is located close to a village then a tambol center as&#13;
well as a hospital may also be close to the village. The authors use a&#13;
trichotomous measure of availability: (1) a district center, where a hospital&#13;
or amphor health center is located, is close to the village (within 4&#13;
kilometers), (2) a district center is far from the village but a tambol center&#13;
is near, and (3) neither a district center nor a tambol center is within 4&#13;
kilometers of the village. Of the 193 villages included in their sample, 18&#13;
percent are near a district center, 50 percent are near a tambol center but&#13;
far from a district center, and 32 percent far from both. Holding constant&#13;
education, desire for additional children, and age of woman, they find that&#13;
proximity to a source of supply increases contraceptive use. For example,&#13;
among women thirty-five to forty-four with the modal characteristics of women&#13;
in this age group, the predicted level of use of efficient methods is 59.9&#13;
percent if neither a tambol nor district center is nearby, 65.1 percent if a&#13;
tambol center is nearby, and 67.5 percent if a district center is near&#13;
(Entwistle, et. al. 1982, p. 15). Among women aged twenty-five to forty-four,&#13;
there is no interaction between availability and education on use. That is,&#13;
proximity neither reduces nor increases the influence of education on&#13;
contraceptive use. For women fifteen to twenty-four, availability enhances&#13;
the positive effects of education on use. The authors suggest that&#13;
availability may encourage spacing among young women with four or more years&#13;
of schooling (Entwistle, et. al., 1982, pp. 13-14).&#13;
George Simmons (1971) analyzed data on IUD and sterilization acceptances&#13;
per 1,000 persons in 246 districts of India in 1966. Holding constant adult&#13;
literacy, urbanization, or per capita income, Simmons estimated that a 10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
percent increase in the number of clinics per capita was associated with a 3&#13;
percent to 4 percent increase in the combined acceptance rates of IUDs and&#13;
sterilization (Simmons 1971, Table V-5, p. 118). In a similar analysis of&#13;
fifty-six districts with more complete data, he also found that a 10 percent&#13;
increase in the number of extension workers per capita increased acceptance&#13;
rates by 4-6 percent. He concluded that his results were "consistent with the&#13;
hypothesis that past variations in the number of family planning acceptors by&#13;
district has been the result of variations in the inputs to the family&#13;
planning program" (Simmons 1971, p. 119).&#13;
Only a few studies have investigated the influence of program inputs or&#13;
availability of family planning services on fertility decline. Some of these&#13;
studies are summarized in this section.&#13;
T. Paul Schultz (1971, 1974) and Albert Hermalin (1975) examined the&#13;
impact of two types of family planning workers on fertility change in the 381&#13;
administrative regions of Taiwan over the period 1964-1969. Because their&#13;
results are generally similar, only the work by Schultz is summarized here.&#13;
Measured inputs were the number of man-months of Village Health Education&#13;
Nurses (VHEN) and Pre-Pregnancy Health Workers (PPHW) employed by the family&#13;
planning program per thousand women aged fifteen to forty-nine in a&#13;
district. In estimating the relation of fertility to inputs, all inputs were&#13;
lagged one year. The VHEN disseminated principles of home economics,&#13;
sanitation and hygiene, and family planning to the entire village population,&#13;
and the PPHW contacted and recruited mothers, usually over age thirty, with&#13;
recently delivered births. Schultz's regressions relating the change in&#13;
fertility over the period 1964 to 1969 to cumulative family planning inputs&#13;
and differences in child mortality rates, proportion of adult males employed&#13;
in agriculture, and proportions of men and women age twelve years and over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
with primary education certificates imply that a 1 percent increase in the&#13;
number of VHEN decreased the total fertility rate by slightly more than 1&#13;
percent and a 1 percent increase in the number of PPHW decreased total&#13;
fertility by slightly less than 2 percent (Schultz 1974, Table 5, p. 280).&#13;
These elasticities are calculated at the mean values of VHEN and PPHW over the&#13;
period 1964-1968. The average number of man-months of VHEN per thousand women&#13;
in the reproductive ages was .26 and the average number of PPHW was 1.4. The&#13;
marginal impact of additional manpower on fertility was much greater for women&#13;
aged thirty to thirty-nine than for women in other age groups.&#13;
Estimates given in Schultz (1971) imply diminishing returns to&#13;
additional inputs of manpower in any given cross-section at a point in time&#13;
and diminishing returns over time. For example, according to the estimates&#13;
for 1966, if only one-third of a man-month of a PPHW's time had been allocated&#13;
to a community of 1,000 women of childbearing age in 1964 and 1965, then an&#13;
increase in PPHW by only one-tenth of a man-month would be required to avert&#13;
one additional birth. If the community had had 1.6 man-months of PPHW time,&#13;
then an additional one-tenth of a man-month would have averted only one-half&#13;
of a birth. From 1965 to 1968, evaluated at the mean number of months of PPHW&#13;
time, the marginal cost of averting a birth rose fifteen-fold, assuming no&#13;
changes in personnel costs per man-month.&#13;
Three other findings are of interest. First, in the early years of the&#13;
program, the marginal impact of VHEN on fertility decline exceeded the&#13;
marginal impact of PPHW, especially for women less than age thirty. Second,&#13;
fertility rates of women aged fifteen to twenty-four were negatively&#13;
associated with cumulative inputs of field workers in the early years of the&#13;
program, but were positively associated with cumulative inputs in the later&#13;
year of the program. Schultz suggests that the ability of younger women to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
control fertility with the increased availability of modern contraception led&#13;
to reductions in child spacing and perhaps promoted earlier marriage (Schultz&#13;
1971, pp. 32-35). Third, marginal impacts of family planning inputs differed&#13;
depending on the characteristics of areas. For example, program inputs were&#13;
more effective in 1966 in agricultural regions with low child mortality and&#13;
high proportions of children enrolled in schools, but were neither more or&#13;
less effective in regions with higher or lower levels of adult education&#13;
(Schultz 1971, p. 57). In addition, family planning program inputs were more&#13;
effective in areas with substantial decline in child mortalty from 1961 to&#13;
1965 and in localities with more rapid increases in child schooling rates&#13;
(Schultz 1971, p. 58). Nonetheless, the direct effects of family planning&#13;
inputs in reducing fertility were large relative to impacts of terms involving&#13;
interactions with socioeconomic variables.&#13;
Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1982) examined the determinants of recent&#13;
fertility among women in India in 1968-1971, measuring family planning inputs&#13;
6y the fraction of villages having a family planning clinic in the district in&#13;
which a woman resides. Holding constant wife's and husband's education,&#13;
wife's age, farm and non-farm residence, and district level health, schooling,&#13;
and sanitation characteristics, they found that doubling the number of&#13;
villages in a district with a family planning clinic (from 2 percent to 4&#13;
percent) would reduce fertility by 13 percent, reduce child mortality, and&#13;
raise school attendance by 11 percent. Over the lifetime of a representative&#13;
woman, this fertility reduction would lead to a decline in births by about&#13;
one-half child. The combined effect of fertility and mortality decline would&#13;
reduce family size by about four-tenths of a child.&#13;

V. Experiments&#13;
There have been numerous experiments to assess the impact of alternative&#13;
conraceptive delivery systems on contraceptive use and fertility (Cuca and&#13;
Pierce 1977; Faruqee 1982; Faruqee and Johnson 1982; and Agree 1983). In this&#13;
section of the paper I review briefly a few of these experiments. Two&#13;
criteria are imposed in selecting the projects to be reviewed. First, the&#13;
experiment must have a control group. Without a control group one cannot&#13;
measure the impact of the delivery system independent of other environmental&#13;
changes taking place during the course of the experiment. For example, a test&#13;
of the efficacy and feasibility of household delivery of contraceptives in&#13;
Morocco conducted over the period 1977-1979 showed an increase in&#13;
contraceptive prevalence from 50 percent to 65 percent among urban women and&#13;
from 12 percent to 45 percent among rural women (Agree 1983). It is quite&#13;
possible that the distribution systems had a significant effect on use, but&#13;
without a control site in which women were not exposed to the intervention,&#13;
one cannot conclude unambiguously that increased accessibility was the source&#13;
of increased contraceptive prevalence. Second, pre-program and post-program&#13;
measures of fertility or contraceptive use must be reported. This criterion&#13;
eliminates experiments which measure output by the number of contraceptives&#13;
delivered.&#13;
Table 13 summarizes the characteristics and results of eleven&#13;
experiments involving increased accessibility of contraception. With the&#13;
exception of the contraceptive delivery experiment in Rio de Janeiro&#13;
(Experiment 3), a project in an urban area where contraceptives were already&#13;
available, all experiments report that greater availability yields bigger&#13;
declines in fertility or increases in prevalence. Project effects are,&#13;

however, very small in the contraceptive distribution program of the Cholera&#13;
Research Laboratory in Bangladesh (Experiment 1) and the condom marketing&#13;
scheme in Kenya (Experiment 6). Aside from the fertility reducing and use&#13;
enhancing effects of availability, it is difficult to draw any other lessons&#13;
from the experiments because of the diverse nature of the projects and of the&#13;
target populations. There is modest evidence that combining contraceptive&#13;
delivery with maternal or child health services yields a bigger impact on&#13;
fertility than contraceptive delivery alone (Experiment 1 versus Experiment 2;&#13;
Experiment 5). Of course, it is difficult to evaluate whether or not access&#13;
to contraceptive supplies is the same in programs offering services other than&#13;
contraceptive distribution. For example, clinics offering multiple sevices&#13;
may be open more hours per day than those providing only contraceptive&#13;
supplies. In addition, evidence from other experiments on integration of&#13;
services is less positive. For example, an experiment in Narangwal, Punjab in&#13;
India provided different mixes of family planning and health services: (a)&#13;
family planning services and family planning education; (b) family planning&#13;
services, women's health care, and child health care; (c) family planning and&#13;
women's health care; (d) family planning and child care (including nutrient&#13;
supplements); and (e) no services. In areas with projects, there was little&#13;
difference among interventions in the number of new acceptors or in levels of&#13;
contraceptive use adjusted for efficiency of method at comparable dates&#13;
following program intervention (Faruqee 1982, Figure 3 and Figure 4,&#13;
p. 13).&#13;

VI. Conclusion&#13;
Economic theory suggests that increasing access to, or availability of,&#13;
contraceptive methods will increase contraceptive use and reduce the demand&#13;
for children. This paper has reviewed many studies of the empirical&#13;
association among contraceptive availability, contraceptive use, and&#13;
fertility. Cross-national evidence on the impact of family planning effort&#13;
indicates that the expansion of family planning programs over the decade 1965&#13;
to 1975 resulted in measurable fertility decline. This evidence, however,&#13;
does not in itself indicate that increased availability of contraceptive&#13;
supplies reduced fertility, since family planning programs include many&#13;
components other than contraceptive distribution. Studies of perceived&#13;
availability suggest that women who do not know of an outlet for&#13;
contraceptives are less likely to use contraception than women who do know of&#13;
an outlet and that women who know of a closer source of supply are more likely&#13;
to use contraception, especially more efficient methods of contraception, than&#13;
women who know only of more distant sources. Controlling for rural-urban&#13;
residence, education, and other socioeconomic variables has little effect on&#13;
the association between increased contraceptive use and increased perceived&#13;
promimity in most countries. An important weakness of these studies is that&#13;
women who wish to restrict fertility and who therefore wish to use&#13;
contraception are more likely to search for, and to find, a source of&#13;
supply. Knowledge of a source and use of contraception are thus jointly&#13;
determined. Consequently, it may well be the case that the results of studies&#13;
of the relation of perceived availability to use may overstate the impact of&#13;
increased access. For this reason, studies relating use of contraception or&#13;
fertility to measures of actual availability such as distance from residence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
to nearest supply source, density of clinics, and extension worker inputs per&#13;
couple provide much more useful evidence.&#13;
Numerous studies of the effect of increased actual availability,&#13;
including the results of experiments, indicate that increased access to&#13;
sources of contraceptive supply results in an increase in contraceptive use&#13;
and a decrease in fertility. Because of wide differences in the&#13;
characteristics of the populations studied, because of differences among&#13;
studies in the measurement of access to methods of contraception, and because&#13;
of differences in methodology, it is not possible to summarize easily the&#13;
estimated impacts of increased access on contraceptive use or fertility in&#13;
these studies. In some studies the effects of access seem to be large. For&#13;
example, Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1982) estimated that doubling the fraction of&#13;
villages with a family planning clininc (from 2 percent to 4 percent) in India&#13;
in 1970 would have lowered the total fertility rate by 13 percent. In his&#13;
study of Taiwan, Schultz (1971) estimated that in the mid 1960s a 1 percent&#13;
increase in the number of field workers per thousand women of reproductive age&#13;
was associated with a fertility decline of between 1 and 2 percent.&#13;
Few studies have explored whether there are interactions between&#13;
socioeconomic characteristics of couples and the effects of increased access.&#13;
This issue is worthy of further attention since such studies might show the&#13;
distributional consequences of increased access and might also provide some&#13;
evidence as to the conditions under which family planning inputs would have&#13;
the greatest marginal impact on contraceptive use and fertility decline.&#13;
Entwistle, et al (1982) found virtually no differences of increased proximity&#13;
on contraceptive use by education of mother in Thailand. Schultz (1981) found&#13;
that the marginal effects of family planning inputs on fertility decline were&#13;
neither higher nor lower in areas in which parents had more or less education,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
but did find that the marginal impacts were greatest in areas that had&#13;
experienced the largest declines in child mortality and the greatest increases&#13;
in child enrollment ratios in the period before the advent of the family&#13;
planning program.&#13;
In short, there is overwhelming evidence that greater access to&#13;
contraceptive supplies results in increased use of contraception and fertility&#13;
decline. We have as yet, however, rather weak evidence on the precise&#13;
magnitudes of these effects and the ways in which differentials in&#13;
socioeconomic characteristics of couples make these effects large or small.&#13;

Appendix&#13;
In order to provide a framework for examining empirical research on&#13;
the effects of improved access to contraceptive methods on contraceptive use&#13;
and fertility, I develop in this section a simple one-period model of the&#13;
demand for children and the demand for conteraception by couples who have&#13;
reached a given point (for example, marriage duration) in the life cycle. The&#13;
model is adapted from one used by Rosenzweig and Seiver (1982) in their&#13;
investigation of the effects of education on contraceptive choice.&#13;
The household is characterized by a fixed level of wife's education,&#13;
S, and a level of excess (or deficit) fertility, X, representing deviations&#13;
from optimal planned fertility in previous periods. The household's utility&#13;
function is:&#13;
(1)    U = U(N,Z;X,E)     U &gt;0, U &gt;0, U  &lt;0,&#13;
where N is live births in the planning period, Z is a composite commodity&#13;
consumed by household members, and E is a set of variables characterizing the&#13;
environment in which the household resides. Community norms affecting&#13;
preference for children versus other goods could be a component of E.&#13;
The number of births in a period,&#13;
(2)    N = n - A(C),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
is the difference between the number of children the couple would have in the&#13;
absence of contraception, n , and the number of births averted by&#13;
contraception, A, where the number of births averted depends on the quantity&#13;
of contraceptives used, C.i/ Excess fertility is assumed to be negatively&#13;
related to wife's schooling and positively to the price (availability) of&#13;
contraception in previous periods, p, and fecundity, n,&#13;
(3)    X= X(S, p , n)     X s&lt;0, X  &gt;0, X_&gt;0.&#13;
n&#13;
These assumptions are plausible if wives with more schooling and users of&#13;
contraception have better control over the variance of fertility, for a given&#13;
level of fecundity, so that deviations from planned fertility are smaller for&#13;
wives with more S or for couples with a lower p (Rosenzweig and Seiver, 1982,&#13;
P. 174; Keyfitz, 1971). Similarly, for a given level of contraceptive use,&#13;
wives with higher fecundity (n) are likely to have higher excess fertility.&#13;
The budget constraint is&#13;
(4)    F= P  n + P   C + P  Z,&#13;
n      c       z&#13;
where F is full income,   P  is the price of a child, and   P  and P  are the&#13;
per unit costs of contraceptives and the composite commodity, respectively.&#13;
All prices incorporate time costs of purchasing and consuming goods. It is&#13;
further assumed that the price of contraception is inversely related to wife's&#13;
It would be relatively easy to incorporate selection of contraceptive&#13;
method into the model, but the complications of introducing more than one&#13;
method do not yield insights important to the questions addressed in this&#13;
paper. If more than one method is used, then optimal usage would involve a&#13;
choice of methods such that the marginal costs of averting a birth are&#13;
identical for each method.&#13;

schooling on the hypothesis that women with more schooling have lower&#13;
information costs about contraception or, alternatively, have greater&#13;
efficiency in contraception use, so that births averted per unit of&#13;
contraception are lower for more educated women.2/ Finally, it is assumed&#13;
that more educated women have higher values of time, so that the price of&#13;
children is greater for such women. For simplicity, it is assumed that:&#13;
(5)     p   =  y + Â¢(S)         s &lt;0, and&#13;
(6)     P = n   + 0(s)          e &gt;0,&#13;
n                       s&#13;
where y and a are direct prices of contraception and children, respectively,&#13;
and *(S) and 8(S) are functions reflecting the modifying impacts of schooling&#13;
on these prices.&#13;
The first order conditions for the maximization of (1) subject to&#13;
(2) - (6) are&#13;
(7a)    - U   A  + X (P  A - P )    0&#13;
n  c        n  c   c&#13;
(7b)    U   - x P  = 0,&#13;
z       z&#13;
where X(&gt;O) is a Lagrangean multiplier. These conditions can be rearranged&#13;
to yield:&#13;
U    P   - P /A&#13;
(8)      n     n    c  c&#13;
z          z&#13;
2/ An alternative specification is to introduce schooling into the births&#13;
averted function.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
Since   P / A   is the marginal cost of averting a birth, the net price of a&#13;
child is   P  minus the savings in contraceptive costs from having an&#13;
additional birth. Thus, equation (8) indicates that at the optimum, the&#13;
marginal rate of substitution of children for other goods equals the ratio of&#13;
the net price of a child to the price of other goods.&#13;
Differentiating totally the first order conditions and solving for&#13;
the response of contraceptive use to changes in the model's parameters, we&#13;

contraceptives used and reduces the number of children demanded. The second&#13;
influence of a change in price is an income effect. That is, the fall in&#13;
price raises real income and thus may induce the couple to buy more or fewer&#13;
contraceptives. There are no direct empirical estimates of the effect of&#13;
income on the demand for contraception. However, it can be shown from&#13;
equation (10) that&#13;
SC = _ 1    Sn&#13;
SF     A    SF&#13;
c&#13;
Thus, if children are normal goods, then contraception is an inferior good.&#13;
Conversely, if fertility falls as full income rises, then contraception is a&#13;
normal good. There are numerous estimates of the effect of increases in full&#13;
income on the demand for children in LDC's.3/ Most estimates, although not&#13;
all, suggest a small negative impact of income on fertility, which implies&#13;
that contraception is a normal good. Hence, the effect of increased income on&#13;
the demand for contraception resulting from a decrease in the price of&#13;
contraception augments the substitution effect. Since, however, the effect of&#13;
income on the demand for children is small and since expenditures on&#13;
contraception are likely to be only a small fraction of income, the income&#13;
effect is likely to be small.&#13;
Aside from the important theoretical argument that the quantity of&#13;
contraception demanded is inversely related to its price (and thus positively&#13;
to its availability), the foregoing discussion also suggests that the demand&#13;
for children is positively related to the price of contraception (and thus&#13;
3/ The estimates assume that the coefficient of husband's income in a&#13;
demand for children equation represents the impact of changes in full&#13;
income.&#13;

To interpret the influences of changes in various parameters on the&#13;
demand for contraception it is useful to recall that n = n - A, so that&#13;

Equation (10) shows that the demand for children and the demand for&#13;
contraception respond in opposite ways to changes in parameters. That is, a&#13;
change in any parameter which leads to an increase (decrease) in the demand&#13;
for contraception simultaneously reduces (raises) the demand for children.&#13;
Returning to equation (9a), we see that a reduction in the price of&#13;
contraception (or improvement in access) has two effects on the quantity of&#13;
contraceptives demanded. The first effect is a compensated substitution&#13;
*&#13;
effect (iC &lt;0 ) which induces the couple to increase the quantity of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

inversely to its availability). An important implication of this result is&#13;
that empirical estimates of the effect of availability on use which hold&#13;
constant some measure of the demand for children (for example, desired family&#13;
size or desire for additional children) will understate the impact of&#13;
increased availiability on use of contraception.&#13;
Equation (9b) shows that an increase in the price of children&#13;
unambiguously yields an increase in contraceptive use, provided that&#13;
contraception is a normal good.&#13;
The influence of wife's schooling on the demand for contraception&#13;
(equation (9c)) is complex. The first term in this equation consists of three&#13;
components. The first two components reflect the influence of increased&#13;
schooling on the price of a child and on the price of contraception,&#13;
respectively. The signs of these components imply that a rise in schooling&#13;
increases the demand for contraception. However, the third component includes&#13;
the influence of increased schooling on the timing of fertility. To the&#13;
extent that women with more schooling have lower excess fertility at any given&#13;
period in their life cycle (Xs&lt;0), then women with more schooling have a&#13;
smaller demand for contraception than women with less schooling, other things&#13;
being equal. For empirical evidence on this latter point see Rosenzweig and&#13;
Seiver (1982).   We now turn to the second term in the equation.     Since Xs&lt;0&#13;

and  'C  &gt;0,   the sign of this term depends on the sign of U      . Thus, if an&#13;

z&#13;
increase in X raises (lowers) the marginal utility of Z, the second term is&#13;
negative (positive). The third term is a composite of the income effects&#13;
resulting from the changes in schooling on the prices of children and&#13;
contraception and has an ambiguous sign. This analysis is useful in that it&#13;
reveals some of the channels through which schooling affects contraceptive&#13;
use. However, the analysis implies that the impact of an increase in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
schooling on contracpetive use is a priori unpredictable and is thus an&#13;
empirical question. Microeconomic studies of the demand for children&#13;
generally, but not always, reveal a negative association between education and&#13;
fertility, suggesting that the demand for contraception is ordinarily&#13;
positively associated with schooling.&#13;
Equation (9d) shows the effect of increased fecundity on&#13;
contraceptive use. The first term is unambiguously positive; the sign of the&#13;
second term is a priori ambiguous. The effect of increased fecundity on the&#13;
demand for children is&#13;

Sn        cn&#13;
Even if the net effect of increased fecundity on contraceptive use is&#13;
positive ( S  &gt;0 ),   fertility will be positively related to fecundity unless&#13;
- and births averted per unit of contraception are sufficiently large.&#13;
Sn&#13;
Equation (9e) reveals the influence of contraception availability in&#13;
the past to current contraceptive use. Given the assumptions stated earlier,&#13;
the first term in this equation is positive; that is, the higher the previous&#13;
price, the higher will be current demand for contraception, other things being&#13;
equal. The sign of the second term depends on preferences. If the sum of the&#13;
two effects is positive, then extending service to couples who formerly did&#13;
not have ready access to contraception is likely to result in greater&#13;
increases in contraceptive use than improvements in access for couples which&#13;
already face relatively low prices for contraceptives. More speculatively, if&#13;
this equation has a positive sign, then increasing availability of&#13;
contraception may shift the timing of fertility in the life cycle. Older&#13;
couples having faced relatively high prices of effective contraception in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ill -&#13;
past are likely to have engaged in measures such as postponing age at&#13;
marriage, reducing coital frequency, and prolonging lactation in order to&#13;
avoid future excess fertility. Young couples, facing relatively low prices&#13;
of contraception, do not face the same incentive to delay childbearing. Thus,&#13;
it is quite possible that fertility of young women will rise with increased&#13;
availability.&#13;
Finally, equation (9f) shows that changes in environmental variables&#13;
such as community norms with respect to childrearing may also influence&#13;
contraceptive use. For example, if policies to persuade couples of the&#13;
desirability of small families were successful, then Une &lt;O and contraceptive&#13;
use would increase. Alternatively, if exposure to modernization raises the&#13;
marginal utility of consumption of goods other than children, then&#13;
U  &gt;0 and contraceptive use will increase.&#13;

FEMALE EDUCATION, FAMILY PLANNING,.INCCOME, AND POPULATION:&#13;
A LONG-RUN ECONOMETRIC SIMULATION MODEL&#13;
David Wheeler&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This paper is a cross-country analysis of the dynamic&#13;
relationships linking education, population policy, demographic change,&#13;
and economic growth. It develops an econometric simulation model for&#13;
comparing the long-run benefits of equivalent investments in physical&#13;
capital, female education, and family planning programs.&#13;
The core of the model is a set of econometric equations which are&#13;
estimated using simultaneous equations techniques. These equations are&#13;
designed to track changes in five critical variables: National output,&#13;
investment, total fertility, infant mortality, and family planning&#13;
activity. The equations are fitted to data on decennial changes in&#13;
relevant variables for 70 developing countries.&#13;
Among the results of the estimation exercise, the following appeal&#13;
particularly noteworthy:&#13;
(1) Primary and secondary education substantially&#13;
increase labor productivity.&#13;
(2) The marginal contribution of uneducated labor&#13;
declines with development.&#13;
(3) Dependency rates have no apparent impact on savings&#13;
and investment rates.&#13;
(4) Female schooling and family planning&#13;
activity have a strongly interactive impact&#13;
on fertility.&#13;
(5) Infant mortality responds strongly to female&#13;
education.&#13;
(6) Family planning and total fertility are simultaneously&#13;
determined. Government behavior seems primarily 'reactive'&#13;
(rapid expansion in family planning is associated with&#13;
relatively slow fertility decline, and conversely).&#13;
In the full simulation model, the econometric equations are linke(&#13;
to standard age cohort tables for survival and fertility. The paper&#13;
reports results from comparative simulation exercises for eleven&#13;
developing countries. In all cases, physical investment is dominated by&#13;
enhanced female education and family planning. Both yield higher incomeE&#13;
and lower populations in the long run. Female education dominates as a&#13;
contributor to both income and reduced population in the poorest&#13;
countries, while family planning has a greater impact on population size&#13;
in middle-income countries.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
As its title implies, this paper covers an extremely broad&#13;
subject. It builds, however, on a long-standing tradition in economics&#13;
which began with Malthus (1798/1959); was extended in the early twentieth&#13;
century by Fetter (1912), Keynes (1923), and Hansen (1939); and&#13;
formalized mathematically by Nelson (1956) and Enke (1963). These&#13;
scholars and many others have been interested in analyzing the long-run&#13;
dynamics linking output and population in national economies. Their&#13;
primary concern has been to identify the conditions under which output&#13;
growth can outpace population growth.&#13;
In recent years, this concern has. spread rapidly within the&#13;
community of development scholars, planners, and policy-makers. Although&#13;
some scholars (e.g., Simon (1977)) have defended moderate population&#13;
growth as a stimulant to economic development, most hold the contrary&#13;
view. Policy discussion has therefore been focused on appropriate means&#13;
for reducing the growth rate of population in developing countries.&#13;
Several approaches are currently advocated by major participants&#13;
in the debate. Some emphasize general policies which promote rapid&#13;
economic growth, on the grounds that this stimulates many changes whose&#13;
net result is declining fertility. A more direct approach is advocated&#13;
by those who support enhanced human resource investments, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
particularly female education. Among proponents of this view, the&#13;
anticipated impact is twofold: A stimulus to economic productivity, and a&#13;
direct effect on fertility as education changes female perceptions,&#13;
earning opportunities, and status within family groups. Finally, the&#13;
most direct approach is advocated by those who support rapid expansion of&#13;
contraceptive programs.&#13;
This is not a debate which one faction can "win," in any&#13;
meaningful sense. Fast-growing societies can afford to finance good&#13;
educational programs, and the latter (as noted above) are themselves&#13;
important in assuring rapid growth. Contraceptive programs will be more&#13;
welcome in communities where education and economic growth have already&#13;
altered traditional perceptions and aspirations. The policy problem is&#13;
therefore to assign relative degrees of emphasis to the different&#13;
approaches.&#13;
Such assignment is problematic when good numbers are unavailable,&#13;
of course, and this problem has dogged development planning for a long&#13;
time. Relevant policy simulation models were constructed in the early&#13;
1970's (e.g., Blandy/Wery (1973); Barlow/Davies (1974)), but many&#13;
parameter values had to be guessed. By the late 1970's, the data base&#13;
had improved sufficiently to support the statistical estimation of&#13;
long-run policy models (e.g., Hazledine/Moreland (1977); Wheeler (1980;&#13;
1984a); Marris (1982); Mera/Shishido (1984)). This paper extends that&#13;
tradition. It uses the latest available data to estimate a policy&#13;
simulation model which compares the growth outcomes associated with&#13;
equivalent investments in physical capital, education, and family&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124&#13;
planning.&#13;
The first part of the paper describes the structure of the&#13;
model.1 All of its equations are fitted to a cross-section of measured&#13;
changes in relevant variables during the 1960's and '70's. The economic&#13;
submodel includes simultaneously-estimated equations for physical&#13;
investment and output growth. It incorporates schooling and "managerial&#13;
efficiency" (as measured by the World Bank) as policy variables. The&#13;
demographic submodel includes simultaneously estimated equations for&#13;
fertility, infant mortality, and family planning. Policy variables&#13;
include female schooling, measures of national family planning effort,&#13;
and many public health indices.&#13;
The simulation model is discussed in the second part of the&#13;
paper. For policy simulation, the econometric equations are combined&#13;
with a set of demographic "housekeeping" equations which track age&#13;
cohorts through time. Once country-specific initial conditions and&#13;
hypothetical time paths for the policy variables are specified, the model&#13;
can project national income and population for an arbitrary number of&#13;
periods into the future.&#13;
In the third part of the paper, simulation results are presented&#13;
for eleven developing countries: Togo, Malawi, Kenya, India, Bangladesh,&#13;
Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Bolivia, Honduras, and Mexico. The&#13;
simulations project the long-run consequences of equivalent expenditure&#13;

increases on physical investment and the two social investment options:&#13;
Female education and family planning programs. In all cases, both social&#13;
investment options yield higher incomes per capita in a relatively short&#13;
period of time. Female education yields the best economic result (i.e.&#13;
the highest level of income per capita), while enhanced family planning&#13;
seems generally better as an instrument for pure population control.&#13;
I. The Econometric Model - An Overview&#13;
The core of the simulation model is a set of five econometric&#13;
equations which are used to explain changes in output, investment,&#13;
fertility, infant mortality, and family planning effort. As previously&#13;
noted, these equations are grouped into two submodels which are estimated&#13;
as simultaneous systems.&#13;
A. Economic Submodel&#13;
1). Output Change&#13;
In the economic submodel, output change and physical investment&#13;
are jointly determined. In the output change equation, the basic&#13;
variables are changes in capital and labor. Neither variable is included&#13;
in "raw" form, however.   The output elasticity of labor is assumed to be&#13;
affected by education. To control for its impact, growth in the labor&#13;
force is interacted with measures of primary and secondary educational&#13;
attainment. The equation also allows for a change in the output&#13;
elasticity of uneducated labor as economic development proceeds. To&#13;
control for this effect, labor force growth is interacted with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
prevailing level of per capita income.&#13;
The measure of capital stock change is also modified in the output&#13;
change equation. Aggregative time series measures of the capital stock&#13;
are rare in developing countries, but measures of annual gross domestic&#13;
investment (GDI) are generally available. Division of GDI by output&#13;
yields the investment rate, which is the dependent variable in the second&#13;
equation of the economic submodel. Simple algebra suffices in turn to&#13;
show that the growth rate of the aggregate capital stock is identically&#13;
equal to the product of the investment rate and the output/capital&#13;
ratio.&#13;
Although the output/capital ratio cannot be directly observed, it&#13;
can be proxied by an index of effectiveness in economic management. Such&#13;
an index has been developed by the World Bank's country economists. It&#13;
would be unwise to assume that this index is truly exogenous to the&#13;
output change equation, since its construction has undoubtedly been&#13;
influenced by observed differences in growth rates. It is therefore&#13;
treated as an endogenous variable in the model.&#13;
The final specification of the term which represents change in the&#13;
capital stock is thus rather complex. It is a product of two variables:&#13;
The investment rate and the World Bank management performance index. As&#13;
previously noted, both variables are treated as endogenous in the&#13;
estimation exercise.&#13;
A full discussion of the output equation results is provided in&#13;
the Appendix. The pattern suggested by the results can be summarized as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
follows: Very poor societies generally have low schooling rates and&#13;
disproportionately low management performance indices.2 Much of their&#13;
labor force is engaged in subsistence agriculture. With continuing&#13;
investment in physical and human capital, however, major changes in&#13;
prevailing productivity patterns occur. The marginal contribution of raw&#13;
labor declines as structural change occurs. At the same time, better&#13;
schooling makes a major contribution to labor productivity and to the&#13;
productivity of capital. After several decades of rapid growth, the&#13;
economy is characterized by a relatively high output elasticity of&#13;
capital, a high output elasticity for educated labor, and a very low&#13;
output elasticity for uneducated labor.&#13;
2). Investment&#13;
National savings rates are very important in determining&#13;
investment rates, and existing empirical work suggests that the most&#13;
important determinants of the savings rate in developing countries are&#13;
the output growth rate, income per capita, and capital inflow. There has&#13;
been considerable controversy over the importance of dependency rates in&#13;
this context (Ram (1982,1984); Leff (1969,1984)). Since rapid population&#13;
growth increases the child dependency rate, it is important to test the&#13;
2. The correlation between low schooling and poor economic management is,&#13;
of course, what would be expected. The reduced-form regression used to&#13;
produce fitted values for the World Bank management performance index&#13;
suggests substantial importance for general education as a determinant of&#13;
relative performance. Education does not account for a large proportion&#13;
of variation, however. Since expatriate skills can always be employed,&#13;
at least some of the education handicap can be compensated for. Such a&#13;
compensatory policy has been obvious in several African states (e.g.&#13;
Ivory Coast).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
proposition that child dependency reduces the national savings rate. The&#13;
econometric results reported in the Appendix find no significant effect.&#13;
For the investment rate itself, the determinants of the savings&#13;
rate should remain important. In addition, it is plausible to suppose&#13;
that political stability could have an effect. A series of regression&#13;
experiments suggested, however, that only income per capita and capital&#13;
inflow were significant determinants of the investment rate.&#13;
Considerable stability in investment behavior is suggested by the fact&#13;
that the previous decade's investment rate is also highly significant.&#13;
B. Demographic Submodel&#13;
Much disagreement remains concerning appropriate models for&#13;
explaining international differences in fertility and infant mortality.&#13;
It is probably not controversial, however, to allow for simultaneous&#13;
causation in the specification of behavioral equations. An appropriate&#13;
treatment of the demographic equations should allow for joint&#13;
determination of at least four variables: Fertility, infant mortality,&#13;
governmental family planning effort, and income per capita.&#13;
It is easy to argue that fertility and infant mortality affect one&#13;
another. If fertility is influenced by desired family size, then the&#13;
infant survival rate is an important determinant of expectations. In&#13;
addition, lactation has some contraceptive effect, so that an enhanced&#13;
infant survival rate should have a purely physiological impact on&#13;
fertility. It can also be argued that fertility has an impact on infant&#13;
mortality. Some evidence suggests that child spacing affects infant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -&#13;
survival probability, and child spacing is clearly related to fertility.&#13;
Measures of family planning effectiveness should also be&#13;
considered jointly determined in the demographic submodel. Family&#13;
planning programs attempt to reduce fertility through low-cost provision&#13;
of contraceptives and instruction in their use. Such programs should&#13;
work if optimal fertility is conditional on the cost of contraception,&#13;
and if "achieved" fertility is conditional on correct use of&#13;
contraceptives. Family planning activity may also be affected by&#13;
fertility, however. In countries where fertility decline is already&#13;
evident, the government may be willing to increase its family planning&#13;
effort because it perceives receptivity to be high and political risk&#13;
low.&#13;
Finally, income per capita should be treated as a&#13;
jointly-determined variable in the demographic submodel. The economic&#13;
theory of fertility determination suggests (on the assumption that&#13;
children increase parents' happiness) that per capita income and&#13;
fertility should be positively related, other things equal.     Societies&#13;
with rapidly expanding income per capita will find it easier to finance&#13;
programs which enhance infant survival rates, since revenues will expand&#13;
at constant tax rates. By the same argument, family planning programs&#13;
3. In fact, other things are not likely to be equal in this kind of&#13;
international cross-section work. Increasing per capita income is&#13;
correlated with many changes which increase the opportunity cost of&#13;
child-rearing. An estimated coefficient for per capita income in this&#13;
context will represent mixed effects, and it seems more likely to be&#13;
negative than positive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
might be encouraged. Treatment of per capita income as a&#13;
jointly-determined variable is made necessary by its implicit denominat&#13;
- population. It therefore joins fertility, infant mortality, and fami&#13;
planning effort in the simultaneous system.&#13;
l). Fertility&#13;
The fertility equation incorporates the effects of female&#13;
schooling, family planning activity, infant mortality, and income per&#13;
capita. Female schooling and planning effort are explicitly interacted&#13;
on two prior hypotheses: (1). Enhanced planning effort affects fertili&#13;
in proportion to the level of education of the fertile-age female&#13;
population; (2). Enhanced female education affects fertility in&#13;
proportion to the cost of contraception and the availability of technic&#13;
instruction concerning proper use.&#13;
In the regression results, the schooling-planning interaction,&#13;
income per capita, and infant mortality all appear significant as&#13;
determinants of fertility change. For income per capita, the major&#13;
effect seems contemporaneous. For schooling-planning and infant&#13;
mortality, the results suggest somewhat more importance for a lagged&#13;
effect. One ambiguity is introduced by some doubt about whether&#13;
fertility change and change in infant mortality are simultaneously&#13;
determined.&#13;
2). Infant mortality&#13;
Regression analysis of the determinants of infant mortality has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
allowed for the effects of changes in female schooling, family planning&#13;
effectiveness, per capita income, and the fertility rate. In addition,&#13;
the impacts of a large number of social policy variables were tested.&#13;
Among these were doctors per capita, nursing persons per capita,&#13;
incidence of breast feeding at various ages, vaccination rates, access to&#13;
clean water, and availability of ORT (oral rehydration therapy) packets.&#13;
None of the available measures for the social policy variables seems to&#13;
contribute significantly to the explanation of variance in infant&#13;
mortality rates, with the possible exception of ORT packet availability.&#13;
The limited number of observations limits the credibility of that&#13;
result.&#13;
Female education seems to dominate all other variables as a&#13;
determinant of changes in the infant mortality rate (IMR). In fact,&#13;
three quarters of the variance in IMR changes can be accounted for by an&#13;
equation which incorporates lagged changes in the IMR and the lagged&#13;
change in the planning-schooling interaction. Obviously, most of the&#13;
movement remains "unexplained,' in the usual sense. The apparent absence&#13;
of any impact for the other policy variables is surprising and must have&#13;
something to do with data problems. It is not clear whether the main&#13;
problem lies in the available measure of the infant mortality rate or in&#13;
the measures for the policy variables.&#13;
3). Family Planning&#13;
Family planning effort has been treated as an endogenous variable&#13;
in the fertility and mortality equations because of the possibility that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
it has been jointly determined with fertility change. The most&#13;
reasonable argument in favor of the hypothesis of joint determination&#13;
focuses on "encouragement effects." In a society where the fertility&#13;
rate is already declining, government planners may be able to institute&#13;
family planning programs at lower cost and political risk.&#13;
It should be noted, however, that the "encouragement" hypothesis&#13;
has no unique claim to validity here. If governments are inclined to&#13;
undertake family planning efforts, and if they perceive no autonomous&#13;
tendency for fertility to decline, then they may decide to intervene mor&#13;
actively. This idea seems perfectly plausible a priori, and ambiguity&#13;
surrounds the expected sign of the fertility change coefficients in the&#13;
family planning equation.&#13;
Among the other variables which have been considered thus far,&#13;
female education and per capita income again seem like candidates for&#13;
inclusion in the family planning equation. Female education may enter o&#13;
both the demand side and the supply side (through the availability of&#13;
appropriate cadres), and it seems reasonable to suppose a priori that&#13;
increases in income would make it easier to undertake and finance family&#13;
planning programs.&#13;
Existing work on the determinants of family planning activity&#13;
suggests that certain structural variables may also be important. The&#13;
work of Kelly and Cutright (1983), suggests that pressure on the land an&#13;
heightened sensitivity to "limited space" on islands or in peninsular&#13;
countries have had something to do with family planning effort.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
Kelly and Cutright argue (implicitly) that the pressure of&#13;
population on the existing arable land may become visible to government&#13;
planners as a pattern of rapidly declining marginal labor productivity on&#13;
existing plots and an upsurge of rural-urban migration. The associated&#13;
rise in rural poverty may create a perception of political threat which&#13;
is sufficient to stimulate an interest in population control. This&#13;
interest should be enhanced when nations occupy islands or peninsulas,&#13;
since the perception of "limited space" would be enhanc.ed by obvious&#13;
restrictions on movement.&#13;
These arguments are plausible, although the use of pressure on&#13;
arable land as a determinant of interest in fertility control seems&#13;
unnecessarily restrictive. In Africa, it has become quite common for&#13;
national leaders to deride the notion of fertility control on the grounds&#13;
that African states are "underpopulated" (i.e. have low population&#13;
densities). It is clear that these leaders most frequently have total&#13;
land in mind when such statements are made. For the present purposes,&#13;
therefore, I have employed the standard definition of population density&#13;
rather than density on arable land as the relevant variable.&#13;
The definition of an appropriate dummy variable for&#13;
"Island-Peninsular" status seems more problematic. Using an atlas and&#13;
the area statistics in my data file, I have constructed separate dummy&#13;
variables for "large" islands and peninsulas (e.g. Indonesia, the&#13;
Philippines, Malaysia) and their "small" counterparts (e.g. Haiti,&#13;
Korea, Jamaica). I have used 100,000 square kilometers as the dividing&#13;
line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
The results suggest important roles for several variables in the&#13;
determination of family planning effort during the 1970's. The large,&#13;
positive coefficient for contemporaneous fertility change combines with&#13;
the (much) smaller, negative coefficient for lagged change to favor the&#13;
nreactive" hypothesis. Thus, governments seem to have reacted to slow&#13;
declines in fertility by promoting family planning (ceteris paribus), and&#13;
conversely for rapid declines. The results also suggest that income,&#13;
female education, and perceived population pressure all had something to&#13;
do with the change in planning effort during the 1970's. No significant&#13;
impact of 'Island-Peninsular Status" was discernible.&#13;
II. The Simulation Model&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
The econometric results presented above provide the essential&#13;
equations for a long-run model of economic-demographic dynamics. In the&#13;
economic submodel, changes in national income and physical capital&#13;
accumulation are jointly determined. Predetermined variables include the&#13;
rate of human capital accumulation (measured by primary and secondary&#13;
schooling); the effectiveness of economic management; political&#13;
stability; foreign investment (proxied by the [current account&#13;
deficit/GDP] ratio); and the growth rates of population and the labor&#13;
force. The latter is determined by past rates of fertility and infant&#13;
mortalityv as well as by prevailing age-specific mortality rates in the&#13;
interim.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
In the demographic submodel, changes in fertility, infant&#13;
mortality, and family planning activity are jointly determined.&#13;
Predetermined variables include the growth rate of national income;&#13;
female schooling; lagged change in the infant mortality rate; lagged&#13;
change in income per capita; lagged change in fertility; and the level of&#13;
population density.&#13;
The econometric results make it clear that long-run economic&#13;
growth models should incorporate demographic factors (and conversely).&#13;
Changes in national income have an impact on fertility, both directly and&#13;
indirectly (through effects on family planning activity and (through&#13;
family planning) on infant mortality). Changes in fertility and&#13;
mortality have an impact on the domestic savings rate because they change&#13;
population, the denominator of income per capita. In addition, they are&#13;
the essential determinants of growth in the labor force.&#13;
The results make it particularly clear that estimates of the rate&#13;
of return to investments in education and family planning must take into&#13;
account both economic and demographic factors. For example, the results&#13;
suggest substantial direct returns to education through its impact on&#13;
labor productivity. They also raise the possibility of powerful indirect&#13;
effects for female education through induced fertility decline.&#13;
An evaluation of the indirect impact of female education on&#13;
national income is complicated by several factors. First, its impact on&#13;
fertility may be partly (or totally) offset by its simultaneous impact on&#13;
infant mortality, so that the growth rate of population may be little&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
effected. Even if a higher female schooling rate does induce a lower&#13;
population growth rate, the positive impact on income per capita may be&#13;
counteracted by a subsequent decline in the growth rate of the labor&#13;
force. Age-specific mortality rates will obviously join the infant&#13;
mortality rate in determining changes in the labor force.&#13;
When so many complex, long-run dynamics are in question, it is not&#13;
possible to produce an evaluation of returns to education from&#13;
calculations based solely on the econometric equations. They must be&#13;
embedded in a long-run simulation model which also incorporates realistic&#13;
initial conditions and appropriate models of age-specific fertility and&#13;
mortality. This chapter will be concerned with the specification and&#13;
application of such a model.&#13;
B. Age-Specific Fertility and Mortality Schedules&#13;
While the estimated econometric equations certainly form the core&#13;
of the simulation model, it is clear that additional elements must be&#13;
added. The most important of these are equations which allow for the&#13;
impact of age-specific rates of fertility and mortality on population&#13;
dynamics. The fertility equations must translate a general rate&#13;
(produced by the econometric model) into rates by age cohort for women&#13;
whose ages are between approximately 15 and 49. These cohort rates are&#13;
extremely important, since they determine the time-phasing of additional&#13;
births during the first decades of the simulation. The mortality&#13;
equations make an important contribution by determining female survival&#13;
to age 49, and survival generally (particularly to the age of retirement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
from the labor force).&#13;
Country-specific fertility and mortality schedules are not common&#13;
in the developing world. For mortality, much effort has gone into the&#13;
construction of tables which can be applied with approximate validity to&#13;
poor countries generally. The most widely-utilized approaches have been&#13;
those of Coale and Demeny (1966) and Brass (1971). As Hill and Trussell&#13;
(1977) have noted, the Brass approach is most convenient for computer&#13;
simulation because it establishes a continuous logistic relationship&#13;
between life expectancy at birth and age-specific survival rates.&#13;
The Brass model has been used for the simulations reported here.&#13;
It is basically a two-parameter logit model which relates the probability&#13;
of death to age. As a brief expositional aid here, these two parameters&#13;
will be termed "A" and "B.' 'A' will be taken as the parameter which&#13;
determines the general position of the relationship (that is, the&#13;
parameter which determines whether half the population has died at&#13;
approximately age 35 as opposed to age 55). "B" will represent the&#13;
"slope" parameter (that is, the parameter which determines the&#13;
responsiveness of death probability to age as the latter increases).&#13;
The mortality schedule incorporated in the simulation model is&#13;
based on calculations reported in Hill and Trussell (1977,. p. 317). These&#13;
calculations take the form of a table of computed life expectancies at&#13;
birth associated with many different values of Brass' "A" and "B"&#13;
parameters. I have chosen the middle "B" value (1.00) as the basis for&#13;
establishing a continuous bivariate relation between life expectancy and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
the "A" value. The results reported in Hill and Trussell are for&#13;
increments of .1 in "A" values, but the relation between 'A' and life&#13;
expectancy is almost exactly linear within the relevant range of life&#13;
expectancy values. I have therefore fitted a bivariate regression to the&#13;
"A" and life-expectancy values to establish a continuous relationship.&#13;
One further complication in the treatment of age-specific&#13;
mortality must be dealt with. The appropriate specification of the&#13;
statistical model of demographic change is in fertility rates and infant&#13;
mortality rates. Thus, the estimated stochastic equations will produce&#13;
infant mortality rate predictions which are conditional on the values of&#13;
predetermined variables in the model. These mortality predictions must&#13;
in turn be made consistent with the full set of age-specific mortality&#13;
rates used in the simulation.&#13;
In order to ensure rough consistency between rates, I have adopted&#13;
a rather awkward expedient. The prevailing methods for calculating&#13;
infant mortality rates and life expectancies at birth are so closely&#13;
related that the variables as reported in the standard sources do not&#13;
really have 'independent" status. This dependency registers as&#13;
near-exact linearity in the relation between life expectancy and infant&#13;
mortality in the sample of 70 countries used for this study. I have&#13;
fitted a bivariate regression to the data for 1980, and have used the&#13;
results as the basis for predicting life expectancy at birth from the&#13;
infant mortality estimate which emerges from the demographic equations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;
Thus, the simulation model employs a three-step procedure for&#13;
determining age-specific mortality rates. Once the values of the&#13;
predetermined variables are set, the infant mortality rate for a&#13;
simulation period is predicted. This rate is plugged into the bivariate&#13;
regression result, which generates a prediction of life expectancy at&#13;
birth. This prediction is in turn used to generate a Brass 'A" value,&#13;
which joins with a 'B" value of 1.00 and the Brass standard life table&#13;
logit values (reported in Hill and Trussell, p. 316) to produce&#13;
age-specific mortality rates.&#13;
The econometric model is fitted to data on decennial changes in&#13;
the variables of interest, and it is therefore natural to adopt the&#13;
decade as the appropriate simulation period for the model. For&#13;
population cohort survival prediction, this amounts to the use of the&#13;
Brass table logit values for every tenth year in the generation of&#13;
survival probabilities.&#13;
For the prediction of cohort fertility rates, the use of decennial&#13;
simulation periods permits a rather simple approach. Since the model&#13;
operates on ten-year intervals, fertility rates for ten-year female age&#13;
cohorts must be predicted. The relevant cohorts are 10-20, 20-30, 30-40,&#13;
and 40-50. The econometric equations generate a prediction of change in&#13;
the total fertility rate, which can be combined with the initial rate to&#13;
produce the prevailing fertility rate during each simulation period. The&#13;
only remaining information is a schedule which dictates the proportion of&#13;
total fertility which is accounted for in each of the four decades of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 v&#13;
fertility.&#13;
The best current source of appropriate fertility schedule&#13;
estimates seems to be the work of Coale and Trussell (1974). Their&#13;
estimates for Peru p. 199) are closest to those required for the present&#13;
purposes, and the following interval proportions have been adopted:&#13;
[10-19] .08; [20-291 .47; [30-39] .36; [40-49] .09. Since age at&#13;
marriage and age of first delivery both tend to increase with female&#13;
education and life expectancy, it is unrealistic to suppose that the&#13;
proportions will stay fixed in the long run. No systematic basis seems&#13;
to exist for predicting shifts in the proportions, however, and Peru does&#13;
have the advantage of lying near the midpoint for incomes per capita in&#13;
the sample of 70 countries.&#13;
C. Incorporating Unit Cost Estimates for Education&#13;
and Family Planning&#13;
Once the age-specific mortality and fertility schedules are in&#13;
place, most of the "housekeeping" functions in the simulation model are&#13;
provided for. From given initial conditions, the model can produce&#13;
estimates of population size by ten-year cohort. These in turn can be&#13;
used to generate estimates of the age groups relevant for primary and&#13;
secondary schooling; the ten-year cohorts relevant for fertility&#13;
calculations; and the total population aged 15-65, which can be used as a&#13;
proxy for the labor force.&#13;
When pre-specified time paths for the primary and secondary&#13;
schooling rates for males and females are added to the econometric&#13;
equations and "housekeeping" functions, the resulting model is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
sufficiently articulated to generate long-run simulation paths for the&#13;
major variables of interest. Several additional adjustments must be&#13;
made, however, before the model is appropriate for a comparison of the&#13;
comparative returns to education, family planning, and physical&#13;
investment.&#13;
The first adjustment has to do with the treatment of family&#13;
planning activity. The econometric results suggested strongly that the&#13;
treatment of family planning as an endogenous variable was appropriate.&#13;
Changes in family planning activity have been significantly associated&#13;
with contemporaneous changes in fertility and income per capita. For an&#13;
explicit comparison of benefits, however, family planning must be&#13;
regarded as a policy variable. Its future time path is therefore&#13;
pre-specified in the simulation model.&#13;
It would be inappropriate for an analysis of comparative benefits&#13;
to treat social investments as costless, of course. In order to assure a&#13;
conservative estimate of the comparative impact of incremental&#13;
expenditures on education and family planning, the simulation model&#13;
subtracts all such expenditures directly from investment. The rate of&#13;
physical capital accumulation therefore decreases as social investment&#13;
increases.&#13;
Unit cost estimates for education and family planning have been&#13;
derived from recent data published by the World Bank (Zymelman, 1982),&#13;
and the Population Council (Nortman, 1982), respectively. The data in&#13;
Zymelman (1982) are sufficient to provide estimates for the (US) dollar&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
cost of primary and secondary education per pupil for almost all&#13;
countries.in the 70-nation sample. The numbers are obviously rough, but&#13;
they have been adopted for the simulation model because they seem to be&#13;
the best available. The median cost of primary education per student is&#13;
approximately $100, while the cost for secondary education is closer to&#13;
$200.&#13;
The family planning data in Nortman (1982) are much rougher, but&#13;
again they seem to be the best available. The Nortman data are&#13;
sufficient to calculate family planning costs per fertile-age woman for&#13;
less than a third of the nations in the 70-country sample. They vary&#13;
widely, but they are generally far lower than education unit costs. The&#13;
median cost per fertile-age woman in the sample is approximately $1.00.&#13;
Thus, the calculation of cost for investments in education and&#13;
family planning is based on the subtraction of full additional costs fro&#13;
physical investment. In the case of education, total primary and&#13;
secondary students are calculated using predicted age-cohort sizes and&#13;
pre-specified time paths for primary and secondary schooling ratios.&#13;
These totals are then multiplied by the Zymelman estimates of unit cost&#13;
for the country in question to produce the associated full cost.&#13;
In the case of family planning, a slightly more involved procedur&#13;
is employed. Where cost data are not available, they are estimated from&#13;
the available data for "similar" countries (Thus, the unit cost for&#13;
Malawi is estimated from the central tendency in unit costs for African&#13;
states). Unit costs are then assumed to be proportional to the index of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 143 -&#13;
quality in family planning effort. Thus, if the current index value is&#13;
30 and the simulation experiment shifts it to 60, the estimated cost per&#13;
fertile-age woman is doubled. The total cost is then calculated from the&#13;
predicted number of women in the fertile-age cohort.&#13;
D. Malawi and Togo: An Illustration&#13;
All the elements are now in place, and it is possible to do&#13;
comparative simulation experiments for specific countries. It should be&#13;
clear by now that no general answer is possible to the question "What are&#13;
the relative returns to female education and family planning when reduced&#13;
physical investment is used to calculate opportunity cost?" The&#13;
econometric results show clearly that the past matters for particular&#13;
countries. A large number of country-specific initial conditions must be&#13;
set before the simulation model can be run. Differing cost estimates for&#13;
schooling and family planning programs complicate things still further.&#13;
Under these circumstances, we must be content with predicting some&#13;
alternative futures for a set of countries, and examining the results to&#13;
see if there are similarities in the general pattern. As will be seen&#13;
shortly, the general pattern seems strikingly similar across countries&#13;
whose initial circumstances are quite different. For the present, the&#13;
approach will be illustrated and its implications analyzed in detail for&#13;
the cases of two African states: Togo and Malawi. Togo and Malawi&#13;
provide excellent material for a comparative case study in this context&#13;
because their economic growth records are similar but their social&#13;
investment efforts have apparently been quite different.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -&#13;
1). The Historical Record&#13;
Malawi and Togo are small, relatively stable African countries&#13;
whose leaders have parleyed rapidly expanding export earnings into high&#13;
rates of physical capital accumulation and economic growth. Togo has&#13;
augmented its traditional dependence on tropical plantation crops with a&#13;
lucrative phosphate mining operation since the mid-1960's. It seems to&#13;
have been affected by the "mining state' syndrome, since its growth rate&#13;
has been quite uneven (averaging 8.4% in the 1960's and 3.3% in the&#13;
1970's). Despite high domestic investment rates (19.1 for the 1960's; 28&#13;
for the 1970's), Togo seems to have been plagued by relatively high&#13;
incremental capital/output ratios. For the 1970's, the World Bank&#13;
country economists awarded it a mediocre economic management score of 4.&#13;
Malawi, on the other hand, has apparently grown as quickly with&#13;
lower investment rates (12.3 for the 1960's; 21.8 for the 1970's).&#13;
Malawi's GDP growth rates for the 1960's and 1970's were 5.2% and 5.8%,&#13;
respectively. A major reason for Malawi's relatively low incremental&#13;
capital/output ratio may be found in management performance, which was&#13;
awarded a superior 7 by the World Bank. Generally, Malawi seems to have&#13;
depended on expatriate managers to a greater degree than Togo.&#13;
Part of the reason for Malawi's greater dependency on educated&#13;
expatriates becomes evident when the social statistics for the two&#13;
countries are examined. Togo has had a clear edge in human resource&#13;
investment. In 1960, Togo had male primary and secondary enrollment&#13;
ratios of 63 and 4, respectively, while the ratios for Malawi were 30 and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -&#13;
1. By 1980, Togo's ratios were 144 and 51, while Malawi's were 70 and 6.&#13;
For females, the educational differences are just as striking. Togo's&#13;
female primary/secondary ratios were 24/1 and 89/16, respectively, in&#13;
1960 and 1980. For Malawi, the ratios were 15/.3 and 49/2.&#13;
The infant mortality statistics support the view that the health&#13;
care in Togo has also been superior. In 1960, the infant mortality rates&#13;
(IMR's) for both Togo and Malawi were among the highest in the world --&#13;
193 and 209, respectively. Both countries registered declines during the&#13;
first two decades of independence, but the Togolese decline was much&#13;
faster. By 1980, Togo's IMR stood at 107, while Malawi's IMR, at 169,&#13;
had not even reached Togo's 1970 level (141).&#13;
In 1960, the total fertility rates for Malawi and Togo were nearly&#13;
identical -- 7.0 and 6.7, respectively. Both rates were unchanged in&#13;
1970, but by 1980 a divergence in experience had begun emerging. The&#13;
Malawian rate actually rose during the 1970's, to 7.8. At the same time,&#13;
the Togolese rate fell slightly, to 6.5. Malawi'5 rate of population&#13;
growth increased from 2.8% per year in the 1960's to 2.9% in the 1970's,&#13;
while Togo's rate fell from 2.9% to 2.4%.&#13;
This small set of comparative numbers is sufficient to show that&#13;
the growth experiences of Malawi and TQgo have been generally consistent&#13;
with the pattern suggested by the econometric results. Both have had&#13;
high investment rates, high labor force growth rates, and a rapid&#13;
expansion of national income. Togo's higher income per capita (twice&#13;
that of Malawi in 1970) reflects what is known about the relative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
development levels of the two economies. Since Togo's schooling rates&#13;
were twice those of Malawi at independence, the two impacts roughly&#13;
balance in the terms posed by the econometric output equation: Togo's&#13;
"rawn labor productivity is smaller, while the contribution of education&#13;
is greater. Since the income and education ratios are about the same and&#13;
their effects opposed, they should roughly balance.&#13;
The patterns of comparative change in fertility and its basic&#13;
determinants also seem consistent with the econometric results. Here it&#13;
is important to recall the overwhelming dominance of the interaction&#13;
between female schooling and family planning effort in the fertility&#13;
equation. The 'gestation period" for education averages about a decade,&#13;
and the econometric results suggest a relatively long lag in the response&#13;
of fertility to change in both planning/education and infant mortality.&#13;
The latter response is comparatively weak, and the response to change in&#13;
income per capita is weaker still.&#13;
Consider, then, the relevant historical evidence for Togo and&#13;
Malawi. Both countries exhibited no public interest in family planning&#13;
until the early 1970's. Once some efforts began, however, they were&#13;
substantially greater in Togo (which had a change of 11 for the 1970's)&#13;
than in Malawi (whose change was 6). Togo began its period of family&#13;
planning expansion with a female populace whose schooling rates were&#13;
twice those of Malawi. Furthermore, Togo had experienced much greater&#13;
declines in infant mortality during the two previous decades (31%; 28%)&#13;
than had Malawi (6%; 15%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -&#13;
Under these conditions, it is not surprising that the fertility&#13;
experience of the two countries began diverging by 1980. In Malawi, which&#13;
was wretchedly poor in 1960, the rapid increase in income seems to have&#13;
promoted an actual expansion of fertility toward a level which had been&#13;
desired but unsustainable at lower income-and nutrition levels. Small&#13;
gains in female education in the late 1960's and a modest decline in&#13;
infant mortality were apparently insufficient to counter this trend.&#13;
In Togo, by contrast, greater social investment levels during the&#13;
previous decades apparently began paying off by the late 1970's. If there&#13;
was a tendency to increase fertility toward the biological maximum with&#13;
increasing income, it was apparently more than offset by the impact of&#13;
enhanced female education, family planning, and infant survival. The&#13;
data suggest that Togolese demographic history passed a critical&#13;
milestone sometime during the late 1970's.&#13;
2). A Prelude to Simulation&#13;
When the simulation model is run for Togo and Malawi, it will&#13;
predict their future growth paths using evidence systematically drawn&#13;
from the histories of states which are further advanced in education,&#13;
health care, and family planning. If these historical patterns are&#13;
relevant, and if management performance can be brought back up to a&#13;
respectable level, then Togo should have great potential for reductions&#13;
in fertility and rapid economic growth during the coming decades.&#13;
As previously stated, the lagged effects of expenditures during&#13;
the 1970's should begin registering in the 1980's. Togo's female primary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
education rate is currently quite high, so that enhanced family planning&#13;
efforts should have a pronounced impact. Some family planning efforts&#13;
are already being made, so the impact of further advances in female&#13;
education should be significant, as well.&#13;
For Malawian fertility, the 1980's look less hopeful. Current&#13;
rates of female education are still relatively low, and current family&#13;
planning effort is negligible. If the patterns suggested by the&#13;
estimated fertility equation continue to hold true, then even a "big&#13;
push" in female education or family planning is unlikely to have a major&#13;
impact during this decade. Since a major vaccination campaign has&#13;
recently been completed, it seems likely that Malawi's IMR will decline&#13;
sharply during the 1980's. Continued high fertility, coupled with rapidly&#13;
falling infant mortality, should assure a surge in population growth&#13;
during the coming decade. By the 1990's, the impact of greater social&#13;
investments in the 1980's should become visible.&#13;
3). Some Illustrative Results&#13;
In order to explore the growth dynamics implicit in the&#13;
econometric equations, alternative futures for Togo and Malawi have been&#13;
simulated under four sets of assumptions about the path of social&#13;
investments. The baseline case assumes that family planning effort and&#13;
the female schooling ratios remain at their 1980 levels. The three&#13;
alternative cases build in progressively greater rates of increase in&#13;
family planning and education.&#13;
The first alternative tracks the impact of increases of 10 per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -&#13;
decade in the family planning score and the combined female&#13;
primary/secondary schooling ratio. The other two alternatives impose&#13;
increases of 20 and 30 per decade, respectively. Increases are&#13;
terminated at ceilings of 80 (slightly below the current Chinese score)&#13;
and 200 for planning and education, respectively. In order to assure&#13;
rough comparability, both countries are assumed to maintain economic&#13;
management scores of 7 throughout the simulation.&#13;
The same unmistakable message is communicated by all the results:&#13;
Investments in female schooling and family planning yield large payoffs&#13;
in the long run. The Togolese case will serve as the basis for analyzing&#13;
the general quality of the results, and a comparison with the projections&#13;
for Malawi will be used for a discussion of the apparent importance of&#13;
initial conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 150 -&#13;
As the simulation begins in 1980, Togo has an income per capita of&#13;
$(US) 363 and a population of approximately 2e6 million. It has made&#13;
relatively rapid strides in female (and male) education during the&#13;
1970s, and has recently embarked on a modest family planning program.&#13;
Infant mortality has fallen considerably from the pre-independence level,&#13;
and the economy is maintaining a high rate of investment. With&#13;
substantial numbers of secondary and university graduates now available&#13;
and the chastening experience of the 1970's in mind, the government&#13;
manages to improve its management performance level from 4 to 7 in 10 on&#13;
the World Bank scale.&#13;
A glance at Togo's demographic profile in 1980 immediately reveals&#13;
a looming problem for the coming decade. Although Togo's total fertility&#13;
rate has already fallen slightly in response to large social investments,&#13;
it is still among the highest in the world at 6.5. Since infant mortality&#13;
has continued to decline and a large number of women are just entering&#13;
the prime years for fertility, the population growth rate is on the verge&#13;
of jumping sharply upward. From a 2.4% annual increase during the&#13;
1970's, a move upward to a peak of 3.9% is anticipated for the 1980's.&#13;
Obviously, this surge is going to put a strain on the social&#13;
infrastructure, and anticipated education costs are a matter of&#13;
particular concern. On the assumption that the female and male schooling&#13;
rates continue only at their levels of the 1970's, an additional 4% of&#13;
national output will have to be allocated to primary and secondary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151 -&#13;
education. On the assumption that all additional costs are subtracted&#13;
from physical investment, the investment rate will drop from 28% to about&#13;
24%.&#13;
The obvious implication is that Togo is in for a period of&#13;
relatively slow growth of income per capita. Improved management&#13;
performance and the consequent decrease of the incremental capital/output&#13;
ratio assure that the disappointing experience of the 1970's is not&#13;
repeated. Output is anticipated to grow at a respectable 6.3%, but the&#13;
high anticipated rate of population growth (3.9%) implies a growth in&#13;
income per capita of only 2.9% during the decade.&#13;
In the early 1980's, the Togolese leadership is faced with an&#13;
important decision. They can move forward rapidly with female education&#13;
and family planning, allocating additional scarce resources to these&#13;
activities, or they can simply maintain the status quo, keep the&#13;
investment rate high, and count on continuing increases in income per&#13;
capita and declines in infant mortality to move fertility downward in the&#13;
long run.&#13;
The comparative consequences of the two strategies can be most&#13;
easily discerned by comparing columns "0" (no change in family planning&#13;
effort or education rates) and '+30" (decennial increases of 30 in both&#13;
the family planning index and the sum of female primary and secondary&#13;
education). A glance at the simulated time series for income per capita&#13;
and population leaves little doubt about the outcome: By 2050, the social&#13;
investment strategy has doubled the anticipated income per capita and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -&#13;
more than halved the anticipated population. The population stands at&#13;
about 11 million and population growth is near ZPG at .4% annually.&#13;
The basis for superior performance under the social investment&#13;
option can be discerned in the evolution of three basic numbers: The&#13;
fertility rate; the investment rate; and the growth rate of national&#13;
output. The most striking difference between the "0" and "+30" columns&#13;
can be seen in the comparative time plots for the total fertility rate.&#13;
Under the "laissez faire" strategy, continued declines in the infant&#13;
mortality rate and increases in income per capita promote a steady,&#13;
unspectacular fall in the fertility rate. This averages about .5 per&#13;
decade until 2020, when declines of about .4 set in. By 2050, the&#13;
fertility rate has declined from its current level of 6.5 to about 3.3.4&#13;
The contrast provided by the numbers in the maximum social&#13;
investment column is striking. During-the first decade of the program,&#13;
gains seem rather modest because the affected population is still in&#13;
school. By the 1990's, however, the response begins coming dramatically&#13;
into view. In the last decade of the twentieth century and the first&#13;
decade of the twenty-first, the fertility rate drops from 5.8 to 3.1.&#13;
4. The evolution of the IMR is also critical for population growth&#13;
projections, of course, but the econometric results have yielded only a&#13;
relative mild contribution for education and family planning as compared&#13;
with the "autonomous" forces propelling decline. Social investments&#13;
clearly make some difference, as evidenced by the comparative time paths&#13;
taken by the IMR from 1980 to 2030. The "big push" promotes a more rapid&#13;
rate of decline for the IMR, so that it is half that which characterizes&#13;
the baseline case by 2020. The absolute rate of decline is quite rapid in&#13;
both cases, however. It is therefore the fertility story which dominates&#13;
the comparison.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -&#13;
By this time, full family planning efforts are in progress, and&#13;
female primary and secondary schooling have become well-nigh universal.&#13;
Some lagged responsiveness continues the momentum through 2020, at which&#13;
point asymptotic behavior begins setting in.5 By 2050, the Togolese&#13;
fertility rate has descended to a level which is near the current rates&#13;
for the two Germanies.&#13;
A look at the three other critical time paths reveals that the&#13;
social investment strategy has encouraged a self-reinforcing process.&#13;
During the 1990's, the financial burden imposed by additional investments&#13;
in female schooling and family planning leads to an investment rate which&#13;
is modestly lower (23.7 as opposed to 24.1 in the baseline case). It is&#13;
important to recall, however, that the output growth rate and the&#13;
investment rate are simultaneously determined in the model. Some payoff&#13;
to female education is almost immediate, since new secondary school&#13;
graduates enter the labor force during the first decade of the "big&#13;
push." Their predicted incremental productivity is apparently enough to&#13;
offset the impact of the reduced rate of physical capital formation,&#13;
because the predicted output growth rates for the baseline and "big push"&#13;
cases are both 6.3%.&#13;
The Togolese case, then, seems particularly fortuitous. The&#13;
ability to maintain a high investment rate assures continued growth of&#13;
income per capita, which in turn prevents downward pressure on the&#13;
5. Recall that the fertility change equation has been specified in&#13;
percent changes, so that constant proportional rates of decline translate&#13;
to smaller decrements with the passage of time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 154 -&#13;
national savings rate. The "big push" turns out to be effectively&#13;
costless even in the short run, and the long-run results speak for&#13;
themselves. For Togo, in any case, the future looks pretty attractive&#13;
even under the baseline assumptions. The economy continues growing&#13;
nicely, and ultimate population size doesn't suggest a level of crowding&#13;
more onerous than that which currently characterizes the Benelux&#13;
countries.&#13;
Togo's projected experience suggests an ultimate reward for the&#13;
educational foundations laid in the 1960's and 1970's. As we will see&#13;
now, the projections for Malawi suggest that it is also possible to be&#13;
"haunted by history" for a long time. As the 1980's begin, Malawi is&#13;
justifiably praised for its rapid rate of agricultural development. In&#13;
the face of tremendous fluctuations in world markets during the years&#13;
since independence, Malawi has maintained a relatively steady GDP growth&#13;
rate of over 5%. By 1980, it is beginning to leave the extreme poverty of&#13;
the early 1960's behind. Its educational efforts have been modest by&#13;
current African standards, but it has not hesitated to use expatriate&#13;
personnel where local educational skills have been lacking.&#13;
As in Togo's case, the Malawian leadership faces a demographic&#13;
crunch in the 1980's. Unfortunately for Malawi, its emerging problem is&#13;
of unnerving size. By 1980, the demographic results are in from two&#13;
decades of steady agricultural growth, modest investment in female&#13;
primary education, and negligible investment in family planning and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 155 -&#13;
female secondary education. With opportunity costs stable at low levels&#13;
for uneducated rural women and some expansion of income, improved&#13;
nutrition and unchanged aspirations have combined to move the fertility&#13;
rate upward towards the biological maximum. By 1980, Malawi is&#13;
threatening to become the world leader in fertility with a rate of 7.8.&#13;
The policy problem for Malawi's leaders therefore emerges on an&#13;
apparent note of urgency. The recent jump in the fertility rate, coupled&#13;
with a continued decline in the infant mortality rate, implies a jump in&#13;
the population growth rate from 2.9% in the 1970's to around 3.7% in the&#13;
1980's. Again, the cost of schooling the next generation promises a major&#13;
diversion of national resources.&#13;
If anything, the appeal of the "big" push would seem to be&#13;
stronger for Malawi than for Togo. A glance at the projected time series&#13;
for income per capita and population reinforces this view rather&#13;
dramatically. Under the maximum social investment option, Malawi seems&#13;
to stand a chance of stabilizing its population growth by the late&#13;
twenty-first century. Its future looks crowded and relatively poor, but&#13;
the prospects for average income under the 'big push" are certainly&#13;
better (by a factor of three) than under the baseline case.&#13;
It is clear that the basic message for Malawi is the same as that&#13;
for Togo: The social investment strategy pays off, and rather quickly.&#13;
During the "big" push, the relative decline in the investment rate&#13;
continues for some time. Although the rate of physical capital formation&#13;
stays below the baseline rate through 2020, however, the output equation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156 -&#13;
predicts a recovery of GDP growth to parity by the 1990's. The reason for&#13;
this is again the short-run productivity impact of enhanced female&#13;
secondary education. The rapid decline of population growth under the&#13;
social investment option is sufficient to assure that relative economic&#13;
performance will be progressively better as Malawi moves into the&#13;
twenty-first century.&#13;
What is sad about the Malawian case is the anticipated future&#13;
consequences of past policies. If the international behavioral pattern&#13;
registered by the estimated fertility equation continues to hold true,&#13;
and if the rest of the econometric equations remain approximately valid,&#13;
then Malawi's economic future does not look as bright as its past.&#13;
The key to the problem can be seen in the projected time series&#13;
for the total fertility rate and the investment rate. Its dimensions can&#13;
be most clearly seen by considering the projected experience under the&#13;
optimistic assumptions incorporated in the "big push" case. Since basic&#13;
education levels are relatively low and planning activity almost&#13;
nonexistent in 1980, the first decade of social investment is effectively&#13;
devoted to establishing the preconditions for progress on the demographic&#13;
front. Only during the mid-1990's is Malawian fertility predicted to&#13;
fall back to its 1970 level. From then on, the fall is quite rapid&#13;
(decrements of 1.1 or more for three decades), but the damage is&#13;
effectively done. Very large cohorts in the fertile-age population of&#13;
women are assured until well into the twenty-first century. As late as&#13;
2020, then, Malawi's population growth rate is projected at 3%, even&#13;
under the full set of optimistic assumptions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -&#13;
The consequences of this phenomenon for investment are serious.&#13;
If the basic national propensity to save and invest remains constant,&#13;
then the pressure of the demographic bulge on the investment rate is&#13;
projected to dominate through the year 2050. The output-enhancing effects&#13;
of education are sufficient to assure a very modest growth rate of income&#13;
per capita, but after 70 years of effort, national income has only grown&#13;
to $US 1510 - scarcely an encouraging prospect when compared to the&#13;
recent histories of success stories like Singapore.&#13;
The basic message seems relatively clear here. If the econometric&#13;
results mean anything, then Malawi will be faced with a painful choice in&#13;
the 1980's. In the face of an unprecedented demand for educational&#13;
expenditures, it will either have to look to the industrial countries for&#13;
greatly increased transfers (an unlikely prospect at this point), or it&#13;
will to have to force the national savings rate to historically&#13;
unprecedented levels (and use the investible funds productively, even&#13;
though it has very few secondary school graduates of either sex). If it&#13;
is unable to increase the investment rate, then the results suggest that&#13;
Malawi is in for a long period of relative retardation in economic&#13;
growth.&#13;
III. Alternative Social Policies: Comparisons for&#13;
Eleven Countries&#13;
Thus far, the simulation results have suggested that the social&#13;
investment option is generally- better than the baseline option, at least&#13;
for two small African states. Two important questions remain, however.&#13;
First, it would be useful to have some notion of the relative payoff to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
investments targeted on family planning or female schooling. Secondly, a&#13;
sampling from simulations for a much broader set of countries should&#13;
precede any categorical statements about the superiority of the social&#13;
investment option.&#13;
In this section, an attempt will be made to resolve both&#13;
questions. Eight sets of simulation results are considered for eleven&#13;
countries: Togo, Malawi, Kenya, India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia,&#13;
Brazil, Bolivia, Honduras, and Mexico. The relevant initial conditions&#13;
vary tremendously across these countries, so the apparent superiority of&#13;
the social investment option under current African conditions can be&#13;
tested in very different circumstances. Four of the simulation results&#13;
to be reported will employ the four options (0,+10,+20,+30) already&#13;
presented for Togo and Malawi. As in the previous two cases, they should&#13;
provide a good sense of alternative futures under various assumptions&#13;
about the social policy alternative generally.&#13;
The other four simulations represent an attempt to measure the&#13;
returns to alternative social investment strategies. The three variables&#13;
of greatest interest in the current context seem to be income per capita,&#13;
total population, and the total fertility rate. Their long-run&#13;
elasticities of response to alternative strategies are measured using the&#13;
baseline case as the "numeraire.n The baseline case is as previously&#13;
specified: Family planning and the female primary and secondary schooling&#13;
ratios are held at their 1980 levels; all incremental costs for education&#13;
and family planning activities are subtracted from physical investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;
The other three cases simulate the effects of 10% increases in&#13;
female schooling, family planning, and both activities. Once the results&#13;
for income per capita, population, and total fertility are obtained for&#13;
2050, they are transformed into percent differences from the baseline&#13;
case. These percent differences are divided by .10 to obtain response&#13;
elasticity estimates. Since the simulations for Togo and Malawi have&#13;
already demonstrated the importance of initial conditions, substantial&#13;
variation in response elasticities across countries will undoubtedly be&#13;
observed. The major questions are: (1). Despite the variation, will all&#13;
the elasticities have the right sign? (that is, is the social investment&#13;
option always preferable to the baseline option?) (2). Are the&#13;
elasticities for female education unambiguously higher or lower than&#13;
those for family planning? (3). Are there "increasing returns to&#13;
scale"? (That is, are full system dynamics such that the response&#13;
elasticity for a joint 10% increase is greater than the sum of&#13;
elasticities for individual 10% increases?)&#13;
The answers to all the major questions can be determined from the&#13;
comparative elasticity estimates, so a discussion of results will begin&#13;
with a tabular presentation of the elasticities for income per capita and&#13;
population. An economic performance index of 7 has been imposed in all&#13;
cases for comparability.&#13;

The results seem unequivocal on the first question: The social&#13;
policy option seems to be superior in every case, although the degree of&#13;
superiority varies widely with initial conditions. Generally, it is&#13;
clear that responses are higher when prior social investments have&#13;
already established relatively high rates of female schooling and family&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 161 -&#13;
planning activity.&#13;
On the second question, the answer seems to be mixed. Education&#13;
unquestionably dominates in the case of income per capita. The joint&#13;
impact of education on fertility and productivity is so great that it&#13;
dominates a direct attack on fertility through family planning in every&#13;
case. It is important to recall in this context that education appears&#13;
to dominate despite the large unit cost difference between education and&#13;
family planning ($3.00 per fertile-age female for family planning at&#13;
maximal effectiveness vs. around $50.00/pupil for primary schooling and&#13;
$100.00/pupil for secondary schooling).&#13;
For population growth, the evidence is mixed but suggestive. In&#13;
four cases (Togo, Malawi, Kenya, Bolivia), female education produces&#13;
marginally superior results. In the remaining seven, family planning&#13;
seems the better bet. For Malaysia, Brazil, and Mexico, the&#13;
responsiveness of population size to family planning is around twice the&#13;
responsiveness to education. Family planning seems to gain relative&#13;
advantage as the societies move higher in education and planning&#13;
simultaneously. Generally, the direct approach to population control&#13;
seems superior, although the indirect approach through education. is&#13;
undeniably effective, as well.&#13;
The answer to the third question seems relatively unambiguous.&#13;
The joint response elasticity is generally quite close to the sum of&#13;
individual response elasticities, so that "dynamically increasing returns&#13;
to scale" do not seem very important in this model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 162 -&#13;
Thus, the basic message of these four comparative simulations is&#13;
quite consistent for the eleven countries: The social investment option&#13;
always pays for itself very quickly. The long-run responsiveness of&#13;
income and population seem to depend heavily on the degree to which the&#13;
society has already made significant investments in education and family&#13;
planning. For long-run gains in income per capita, investment in female&#13;
education is the superior alternative at the margin. Except for&#13;
societies which are initially at low levels of female schooling and&#13;
family planning, the latter option seems superior as an instrument of&#13;
population control. Even for the least-endowed societies, the&#13;
superiority of education as a means of population control does not seem&#13;
very significant.&#13;
Since the elasticity comparisons for the eleven countries yield&#13;
such consistent conclusions, the results for the remaining four&#13;
simulations are not very surprising. For each country, the experiment&#13;
originally performed for Togo and Malawi is repeated. A baseline case is&#13;
contrasted with projected outcomes when progressively larger investments&#13;
are made in female education and family planning. In every case, the&#13;
"big push" appears to be resoundingly better than the baseline case With&#13;
the passage of time, all the numbers (including the physical investment&#13;
rate itself) become better under the social investment options.&#13;

In large part, the entries in the table above speak for&#13;
themselves. For societies which currently have low incomes, schooling&#13;
rates, and family planning effort, the economic gains associated with the&#13;
social investment option are very large. Per capita income doubles for&#13;
Togo and India. It approximately triples for Malawi, Kenya, Bangladesh,&#13;
Bolivia, and Honduras. Even for relatively well-endowed societies such&#13;
as Brazil, Malaysia, and Mexico, the economic gains are clear.&#13;
The population story is equally noteworthy. By 2050, projected&#13;
population under the maximum social investment option is less than half&#13;
6. As reported in the 1983 World Development Report, Table 19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 164 -&#13;
its baseline level for Togo, Malawi, Kenya, Bangladesh, Bolivia, and&#13;
Honduras. Major reductions are also evident for the other countries.&#13;
The population growth rate projections are of interest because they show&#13;
that almost all the countries are near (or past) ZPG by 2050 in the&#13;
aftermath of the "big push", while many are still growing at a good clip&#13;
in the baseline case.&#13;
Finally, it is of some interest to compare the projections of the&#13;
econometric simulation model with recent stable population projections by&#13;
the World Bank. The methodological basis for these projections is&#13;
entirely different. It is interesting to note, however, that the&#13;
'baseline' and "big push" projections for 2050 (when extended using the&#13;
rate of population growth in 2050 and the pace of decline in that rate)&#13;
do seem roughly coincident with outer bounds for the Bank's projections&#13;
of ultimate population size. Within those bounds, the Bank's projections&#13;
seem to move somewhat randomly. They are close to the "big push"&#13;
projections (which might be termed "optimistic") for Togo, Malawi, Kenya,&#13;
India, Bolivia, and Honduras.&#13;
Somewhat more pessimism seems evident in the Bank's projections&#13;
for Bangladesh, while substantial pessimism seems characteristic of the&#13;
projections for Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, and Mexico. In all latter&#13;
cases, the model has predicted very rapid fertility declines under the&#13;
"big push" because female schooling rates and family planning efforts&#13;
were already relatively advanced in 1980. It is at least possible that&#13;
the Bank's projections have failed to take sufficient account of the&#13;
potential for fertility decline in these four countries.&#13;

I. Output Change and Investment&#13;
A. Output Change&#13;
The estimated output equation reflects a Cobb-Douglas (log-log)&#13;
specification, since it is estimated in percent change form. While the&#13;
treatment of change in the capital stock has been described at length in&#13;
the text, some further notes about the treatment of labor force change&#13;
should be added here. Change in the adult population has been used as a&#13;
proxy for labor force change, since the available labor force data are&#13;
notoriously unreliable. This substitution forces the assumption of&#13;
constant labor force participation through time.&#13;
As noted in the text, the effect of education on the output&#13;
elasticity of labor has been captured with interactions between the&#13;
growth rate of the labor force and lagged primary and secondary schooling&#13;
ratios. As shown in Wheeler (1980), these interactions reflect the time&#13;
derivative of a a mathematical specification of educational impact which&#13;
has three parts: The probability of schooling during the relevant period&#13;
in the past; the probability that schooling leads to relevant learning;&#13;
and the impact of learning itself on productivity.&#13;
In the output equation, the impact of labor force growth is also&#13;
modified to take account of structural change during the process of&#13;
development. In the sample of countries which has been employed for this&#13;
exercise, there are obvious structural differences between the richest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 172 -&#13;
(e.g., Korea, Argentina) and the poorest (e.g., Upper Volta, Burundi).&#13;
Many discussions of unemployment in recent years have focused on the&#13;
question of whether economic growth and structural change lead to a&#13;
decline in capacity to absorb uneducated or unskilled labor. Part of the&#13;
theory of structural unemployment obviously turns on the relationship&#13;
between the marginal productivity of uneducated labor and the level of&#13;
economic development. Under strong assumptions about the shift in&#13;
prevailing production technology, it is possible to argue that the&#13;
marginal productivity of uneducated labor will actually decline as&#13;
development proceeds.&#13;
It is important to allow for such a possibility in a model which&#13;
relates education to economic growth and demographic change. In the&#13;
output change equation, an interaction between growth in the labor force&#13;
and the level of per capita income (a proxy for level of economic&#13;
development) has therefore been introduced.&#13;
Although the discussion in the text is focused on the&#13;
contributions of labor, capital, and education to output growth, the&#13;
econometric estimation has also taken account of the possible impact of&#13;
the many violent events which characterized the 1960's and 1970's. The&#13;
role of certain structural variables has been considered, as well. In&#13;
the following subsections, these variables are described in more detail.&#13;
1). Violence&#13;
It would obviously be a mistake to suppose that all forms of civil&#13;
disorder can be treated as exogenous in an output change equation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 173 -&#13;
Strikes, attempted assassinations of public figures, and riots may all be&#13;
caused by poor economic performance. However, there are other forms of&#13;
violence whose historical roots go considerably beyond reactions to&#13;
short-run economic fluctuations. Anti-colonial wars provide an example,&#13;
as do many civil wars, revolutions, and incursions by mercenaries or&#13;
others across national frontiers. Coups d'etat seem ambiguous in their&#13;
relationship to output change in the short run.&#13;
In recent research on Sub-Saharan Africa (Wheeler, 1984b) I have&#13;
taken a careful look at the relations between output growth and indices&#13;
of the occurrence of violence in four categories (anti-colonial wars;&#13;
civil wars (including revolutions); incursions by mercenaries and others;&#13;
coups d'etat). I have used these results as the basis for constructing&#13;
an index of relative stability for the 70 countries in the current&#13;
sample. A "stable year" is considered to be one in which no coup,&#13;
mercenary incursion, or act of civil war occurred.&#13;
For the 1970's, I have also set up a simple dummy variable for&#13;
cases in which mass violence has had obviously devastating effects for&#13;
the society in question. The countries which seem the best candidates in&#13;
this category are Uganda, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, El Salvador, Bangladesh,&#13;
China, and Argentina.&#13;
2). Mineral Exporters&#13;
One interesting set of results from my study of stagnation in&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa has to do with the lamentable record of mining&#13;
states. Among African states which had large mining sectors at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 174 -&#13;
independence, relative performance has been quite poor. Several&#13;
arguments have been advanced to explain this phenomenon. It may have to&#13;
do with particular volatility in the terms of trade, or (as seems more&#13;
plausible) it may have to do with a perverse interaction between&#13;
government expenditure policies and the trade cycle.&#13;
In all African mining states, the government either owns the mines&#13;
outright or depends upon them as a major revenue source. Since the mines&#13;
are essentially enclaves which are unaffected by the presence or absence&#13;
of appropriate pricing policies elsewhere in the economy, their presence&#13;
seems to encourage a pronounced form of fiscal indiscipline. In boom&#13;
times, the government is pressured into dramatic increases in current&#13;
expenditure commitments. When mineral price declines occur, retrenchment&#13;
policies make matters even worse. Over time, the problem seems to&#13;
cumulate.&#13;
During the 1970's, it might have been possible to argue that this&#13;
sort of analysis was invalid because it did not apply to major oil&#13;
exporters. The acid test could not come, of course, until a major&#13;
decline in oil prices occurred. The experience of African oil exporters&#13;
in the early 1980's suggests that the "mining states" problem can be&#13;
generalized to include the oil states.&#13;
For the purposes of the present study, I thought that it would be&#13;
of interest to see whether the 'mining state" problem has been general.&#13;
I therefore used the IMF trade yearbook to identify two kinds of states:&#13;
Those which were overwhelmingly dependent on minerals exports of any kind&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 175 -&#13;
(including oil) during the early 1960's, and those for which some&#13;
dependency was evident. In the first group, I have identified Algeria,&#13;
Bolivia, Central African Republic, Chile, Congo, Guinea, Indonesia,&#13;
Jamaica, Liberia, Mauritania, Morocco, Peru, Sierra Leone, Togo, Trinidad&#13;
and Tobago, Venezuela, Zaire, and Zambia. In the secondary dependency&#13;
category are Ghana, Haiti, Malaysia, Philippines, Rwanda, and Tunisia.&#13;
I have also identified states which have had a major dependence on&#13;
oil exports during the period since 1966, and included a dummy variable&#13;
to control for the impact of the oil price Doom on their growth rates.&#13;
3). Econometric Results: Summary of Findings&#13;
In this subsection, the results of a series of regression&#13;
experiments are summarized. There are references throughout to the&#13;
numbered results, which are presented in the next subsection. The output&#13;
equation results indicate, among other things:&#13;
1. Major contributions for education in all regressions&#13;
It should be noted that primary and secondary education ratios are&#13;
quite collinear, so that it has not been possible to investigate separate&#13;
impacts with great precision. It seems clear, however, that both&#13;
variables are related to output growth, and that the hypothesis of&#13;
approximately equal impacts cannot be rejected at any elevated level of&#13;
confidence. In order to make the total impact of education clear, I have&#13;
therefore added PrimaryEd and SecondEd together to produce Education (See&#13;
variable definitions below). This procedure forces equality of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 176 -&#13;
coefficients in the regression result.&#13;
Equation 8 has been used in the simulation model. The magnitude&#13;
of the measured education effect in Equation 8 can be gauged by&#13;
considering the marginal impact of lagged schooling in a society whose&#13;
adult population grew at 3% annually in the 1970's. The implied&#13;
coefficient on schooling is approximately .15 per 10 points in the&#13;
combined Primary-Secondary Enrollment Ratio. Since the upper bound on&#13;
this ratio is somewhat above 200, the implied impact of schooling is&#13;
substantial.&#13;
2. The obvious impact of specification error when&#13;
the model does not take relative efficiency in capital use into&#13;
A-ccoun-t&#13;
Here it is important to recall that use of the investment rate&#13;
alone as the capital change variable requires the assumption that the&#13;
capital output ratio has been constant for societies as disparate as&#13;
Ghana and Singapore.&#13;
When this specification is imposed (See Equations 1-6), the&#13;
estimated coefficient for the investment rate (which can be interpreted&#13;
as the product of the output elasticity of capital and the output-capital&#13;
ratio (presumed constant)) is smaller than its standard error and wanders&#13;
in the neighborhood of zero from equation to equation. When the&#13;
efficiency effect is introduced by interacting the investment rate with&#13;
the World Bank management performance index (produced from fitted values&#13;
in a first-stage regression on predetermined variables), the whole&#13;
character of the result changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 177 ,&#13;
With the inclusion of a correction for management performance,&#13;
change in capital becomes approximately equal to education and change in&#13;
the labor force as a determinant of output change.I In Equation 8, the&#13;
estimated coefficient for the investment rate varies from .014 (for&#13;
C.A.R. and Guinea, which received performance scores of 1 in 1975) to&#13;
.14 (for Singapore, with the top performance score of 10). If we assume a&#13;
maximum marginal output-capital ratio of .3, then these results suggest a&#13;
"potential" output elasticity of capital in the neighborhood of .4 -- not&#13;
markedly different from estimates which have been obtained for the&#13;
industrial economies.&#13;
3. Support for the hypthesis that the output&#13;
elasticity of uneducated labor declines with development&#13;
Experimentation has shown that the interactive specification&#13;
provides a substantially better fit to the data than labor force change&#13;
alone. The interactive variable is expressed as a ratio in order to&#13;
impose the constraint that the elasticity of "raw" labor not drop below&#13;
zero in relatively wealthy societies.2 For a very poor society (1980&#13;
$150 (US)), the implied raw labor elasticity is about .8, while for a&#13;
wealthy society (around 1980 $1500 (US) in this sample) the implied&#13;
elasticity is about .08.&#13;
1. The estimated Beta Coefficients provide one measure of relative&#13;
impact. Note that they are in the neighborhood of .3 for capital, labor,&#13;
and education in Equation 8.&#13;
2. This sort of constraint is especially necessary for econometric&#13;
equations which are to provide the foundation for a long-run simulation&#13;
model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -&#13;
At this point, it is probably useful to summarize the implications&#13;
of the evidence derived from the econometric results for the three main&#13;
variables in the output change equation - capital, labor, and education.&#13;
The impact of investment seems to depend centrally on management&#13;
performance, while the elasticity of "raw" (uneducated) labor declines&#13;
rapidly with development. Experimentation with alternative&#13;
specifications has revealed no apparent trend in the impact of education&#13;
as development proceeds.&#13;
While these results seem plausible, it would not be appropriate to&#13;
make any grandiose claims for them. Formally, the output change model&#13;
corresponds roughly to a variable-elasticity modification of the&#13;
Cobb-Douglas model. It is in the neighborhood of a restricted translog&#13;
model, but is not rigorously derived from such a model. It should&#13;
therefore properly be seen as descriptive rather than "rigorously&#13;
analytical."&#13;
In such a broad sample of societies, I suspect that we will have&#13;
to be content with descriptive" equations of this sort. The process of&#13;
growth from a level of $US 150 to $2000 entails (in the absence of&#13;
windfalls) a tremendously complex set of structural changes. The impacts&#13;
of some of these changes can be captured qualitatively by econometric&#13;
equations of the type employed here. The results can only be suggestive&#13;
from the theoretical standpoint, but they do serve as a systematic basis&#13;
for simulation modeling.&#13;
Among the regression results reported below, Equation 8 has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -&#13;
featured because it controls for major exogenous shocks during the&#13;
1970's. As can be seen from the results for Equation 7, however, the&#13;
estimated coefficients for capital, labor, and education are not&#13;
significantly affected by the use of the three control variables. The&#13;
results in Equation 8 do indicate:&#13;
i). The destructive impact of major internal wars.&#13;
ii). A worldwide recurrence of the "mining states" phenomenon. I&#13;
have checked to see whether this result depends only on the African&#13;
states. It definitely does not. This variable may also be indexing an&#13;
aspect of management performance, albeit in a very deterministic way.&#13;
Mining states had 1.5% lower growth rates annually, other things equal.3&#13;
iii). The positive impact of the oil boom on oil exporters, as&#13;
expected.&#13;
4). Estimated Output Equation Results&#13;
The following equations provide a sampling of the output results.&#13;
Since the World Bank management performance index was only available for&#13;
the 1970's, a growth equation for the 1970's alone has been estimated for&#13;
use in the simulation model. For theoretical purposes, however, it is of&#13;
interest to compare results when identical models have been fitted to&#13;
__________&#13;
3. In passing, it is worth noting that the general quality of policy&#13;
formation seems to be affected by such "exogenous" variables. The&#13;
reduced-form regression for the management performance index suggested&#13;
negative and significant impacts for mining status and internal warfare.&#13;
It clearly doesn't help to have a war going on if you're trying to make&#13;
sensible economic policy.&#13;

Whe variables employed in the output equations are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Growth - Growth rate of GDP&#13;
Capital - Investment rate&#13;
CapEff - Product of Capital and the World Bank&#13;
management performance index&#13;
Labor - Percent change in the labor force&#13;
Lab/PCI - Percent change in the labor force divided by per&#13;
capita income&#13;
PrimaryEd - Product of the lagged primary school enrollment ratio&#13;
and contemporaneous percent change in the labor forc&#13;
SecondEd - Same product using the lagged secondary school&#13;
enrollment ratio&#13;
Education - Sum of PrimaryEd and SecondEd&#13;
MajorWar - Dummy variable for extreme violence, as&#13;
discussed above&#13;
OilState - Oil exporter dummy&#13;
MiningState - Dummy variable indicating dependence on&#13;
minerals exports in the early 1960's&#13;
__________&#13;
4. The number of "stable years" is not included in this set because it&#13;
had no apparent impact on output change. Only major wars seem to have&#13;
had a significant impact. In the case of the dummy variables for "major"&#13;
and "modest" dependency on minerals exports, the estimated coefficients&#13;
could not be distinguished at any reasonable level of confidence. They&#13;
were therefore combined to produce a composite dependency dummy.&#13;

B. Savings-Investment Behavior&#13;
In considering the problem of investment rate determination, I&#13;
have had to devote some attention to savings rate determination. In this&#13;
section, I will therefore present results for both savings and investment&#13;
equations.&#13;
1). Savings Rates&#13;
Since this is an exercise in economic-demographic modeling, it is&#13;
important to consider all possible linkages between population growth and&#13;
economic growth. An explicit consideration of the impact of dependency&#13;
rates on savings rates is therefore in order. There has been continuing&#13;
controversy in the literature over the importance of dependency rates for&#13;
savings rate determination in LDC's. The most recent major contribution&#13;
has been made by Rati Ram (1982). Ram has used an improved data set to&#13;
test Leff's finding (1969) that dependency rates are an important&#13;
determinant of savings rates in LDC's. Ram's findings seem to reverse&#13;
those of Leff.5&#13;
I have used the most recent data for the 70 LDC's in my data set&#13;
to consider the evidence anew. In the savings equations which follow, I&#13;
have looked at the cross-sectional evidence in levels (which Ram and Leff&#13;
have done) and changes (which they have not done). In all cases, my&#13;
__________&#13;
5. Leff apparently remains unsatisfied by these more recent findings.&#13;
For an interesting but inconclusive debate concerning the effect of&#13;
sample choice on results, see Leff (1984) and Ram's reply (1984).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 186 -&#13;
results agree with Ram's. If anything, they suggest that the impact of&#13;
increased child dependency rates on national savings behavior has been&#13;
positive. Generally, however, the dependency results seem so weak as to&#13;
warrant exclusion from final investment and/or savings equations.&#13;
In my treatment of the savings rate equations, I have consciously&#13;
avoided much innovation. I have included life expectancy, on the theory&#13;
that longer horizons may influence private savings behavior. I have also&#13;
considered the impact of improved foreign exchange earnings, because it&#13;
seems quite plausible to suppose that their impact on savings may be&#13;
different than that of enhanced domestic income.&#13;
In other respects, I have deliberately followed the lead of Ram&#13;
and others. The savings rate regression variables are as follows:&#13;
SavRate - Domestic savings rate&#13;
ChildDep - Proportion of children under 15 in the population&#13;
OldDep   - Proportion of people 65 and over in the population&#13;
Growth   - Percent change in GDP&#13;
IncomePC - Income per capita&#13;
CapInFlow - Ram's measure of 'capital inflow", taken as&#13;
the average value of the ratio: (Net Exports + Net Fac&#13;
Payments + Net Unrequited Transfers)/GDP for&#13;
the relevant decade&#13;
BarterTT - Annual growth rate of the barter terms of&#13;
trade&#13;
LifeExp - Average life expectancy at birth for the&#13;
decade in question&#13;
The suffix 'Ch" is used with the variables defined above&#13;
to denote decennial changes.&#13;
The four equations reported below provide representative results.&#13;
The general magnitudes and patterns of significance in the level&#13;
equations for the 1960's and 1970's are in accord with Ram's results&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 187 -&#13;
(obtained from average data for the period 1970-77). Since my primary&#13;
interest here was in testing prior results, I have not used an&#13;
instrumental estimate for the GDP growth rate in the savings equations.&#13;
I have used such an estimate in the final investment rate equations,&#13;
however.&#13;
In the results reported below, the child dependency results&#13;
suggest a positive relation in all cases. I have divided the full sample&#13;
into regional subsamples, and this positive relation seems to hold&#13;
generally. In the regional subsamples it is never 'significant" by the&#13;
standard test, however. The sign for the impact of elder dependency&#13;
seems to wander randomly, and in no case could it be called truly&#13;
"significant" either. It seems fair to conclude that there is no strong,&#13;
systematic relation between dependency rates and savings rates in the&#13;
data which are currently available.&#13;
All four of the regressions reported below (two on levels, two on&#13;
changes) indicate important contributions for contemporaneous growth,&#13;
income per capita, and capital inflow. The results suggest that income&#13;
per capita is the most important explanatory variable in the set. In the&#13;
level equations, I have concentrated on obtaining results from&#13;
specifications identical to those of Ram and Leff. In the work on&#13;
changes, I have also included changes in the barter terms of trade and&#13;
life expectancy for reasons which were discussed above. The evidence&#13;
suggests some role for changing foreign exchange income, but the life&#13;
expectancy results are quite weak.&#13;

2). The Investment Rate&#13;
Since the domestic savings pool is likely to be an important&#13;
determinant of investment, the results above apply directly to the&#13;
specification of the investment rate equations. I have retained the GDP&#13;
growth rate (treated as an endogenous variable),income per capita, and&#13;
capital inflow as righthand variables. I have also included change in&#13;
the barter terms of trade and life expectancy, for the reasons discussed&#13;
above. Finally, I have incorporated my stability measure, on the theory&#13;
that stability is generally thought to be good for investment.&#13;
The cross-section results on levels reported below suggest&#13;
important roles for the major determinants of the domestic savings rate&#13;
and negligible roles for the other variables. The lagged investment rate&#13;
has been included in the level equation for the 1970's, in order to&#13;
capture any systematic long-run components of national investment&#13;
behavior which are not directly observable. The results suggest the&#13;
presence of such phenomena, but they also suggest relatively rapid&#13;
regression toward the mean.&#13;
The latter phenomenon has also been controlled for in the&#13;
investment change equation. This equation should probably be regarded as&#13;
the most stringent test of the importance of the righthand variables, and&#13;
the change to dynamic form does have some consequences. The estimate of&#13;
the GDP growth rate impact becomes negligible in size and significance,&#13;
and it has been dropped from the final result. The other savings rate&#13;
determinants (income per capita, barter terms of trade, capital inflow)&#13;

equations (including the change equation, where percent change is&#13;
employed).  This specification fits the data about as well as the linear&#13;
specification, and is much more believable a priori. The linear&#13;
specification builds in the assumption that large increases in per capita&#13;
income will move the investment rate to unity -- implausible, to put it&#13;
mildly. This kind of difference in specification is especially important&#13;
for a long-run simulation model.&#13;

3). Determinants of Investment Rate Changes, 1960's - 1970's&#13;
Note that the equation below is specified with the investment rate&#13;
for the 1970's as the dependent variable. Since the investment rate for&#13;
the 1960's is a righthand variable in the change equation, the form used&#13;
here simply represents an algebraic transformation (adding the investment&#13;
rate for the 1960's to both sides of the equation). Since the investment&#13;
rate equation will be used with the output change equation in the&#13;
simulation model, this form is preferable. Note that simultaneity again&#13;
intrudes, since the percent change in per capita income includes the&#13;
growth rate of output. Two-stage least squares have been employed and&#13;
(as expected), the result is a substantial reduction in the estimated&#13;
marginal impact of income growth on investment.&#13;

II.Fertility. Mortality, and Family Planning&#13;
A. Specification and Estimation Issues&#13;
Explicit admission of the simultaneity problem in the demographic&#13;
equations gives an obvious appeal to a dynamic specification. A&#13;
behavioral model fitted to international data is only likely to provide&#13;
useful information when time changes are employed. Equations,fitted to&#13;
variable levels across countries at one point in time will inevitably be&#13;
plagued by masking correlations, and differing historical circumstances&#13;
will intrude on the interpretation of results even if simultaneous&#13;
equations techniques are employed.&#13;
The assumption implicit in such cross-sectional work is that&#13;
behavioral relations have been similar across nations at all points in&#13;
history. By contrast, the use of data on changes introduces the more&#13;
reasonable assumption that behavioral relations have been similar in very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 194 -&#13;
recent history.7&#13;
The demographic equation system to be estimated here is therefore&#13;
based on a dynamic specification. Data for 1960, 1970, and 1980 are used&#13;
to calculate decennial changes. The model allows for joint determination&#13;
of fertility, infant mortality, and family planning, and treats per&#13;
capita income as an endogenous righthand variable. Two-stage least&#13;
squares is applied to each equation to assure consistent parameter&#13;
estimates.&#13;
B. Fertility&#13;
The fertility equation is basically log-log in form, with the&#13;
exception of the interaction between female schooling and planning. The&#13;
time derivative is therefore linear in percent changes, again with the&#13;
exception of the schooling-planning interaction term.8 Because&#13;
behavioral adaptation is important here, it seems appropriate to allow&#13;
for relatively long adjustment lags.&#13;
7. For simulation modeling, of course, the use of the change&#13;
specification is extremely desirable. Predicted changes can be added to&#13;
current levels for particular countries if dynamic equations are&#13;
employed. Cross-sectional results would obviously be quite awkward to&#13;
employ in this context.&#13;
8. This specification, while not explicitly asymptotic, has the advantage&#13;
of generating percent changes in fertility rates. It should therefore&#13;
produce realistic patterns of decline for intermediate-run simdlations,&#13;
given the observable range of fertility rates in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 195 -&#13;
Thus:&#13;
Static Specification&#13;
ln Ft = B0+ B1ln Xt+ B2PtSt&#13;
where&#13;
Ft = Total fertility rate&#13;
X = Some appropriate righthand variable&#13;
t         (e.g. per capita income)&#13;
Pt = An index of family planning activity&#13;
St = A measure of female schooling&#13;
Dynamic Specification&#13;
ft = BIxt+ B 2DPSt&#13;
where f,x = Percent changes in F and X&#13;
DPSt = [(dP/dt)St+ (dS/dt)Pt]&#13;
The dependent variable in the estimating equation is percent&#13;
change in the total fertility rate from 1970 to 1980. To allow for long&#13;
lags in responsiveness, the equation is specified in contemporaneous&#13;
decennial changes and lagged changes (that is, for the period 1960-1970).&#13;
1). a&#13;
Fertility. Mortality. and Per Capita Income: These three variables&#13;
in the fertility equation are drawn from standard sources. The infant&#13;
mortality rate for 1960, 1970, and 1980 has been taken from U.N. data.&#13;
The total fertility rates for 1960, 1970, and 1980 have been taken from&#13;
the World Bank Data File, as has income per capita. It is worth noting&#13;
that the specification of income per capita employed here allows for a&#13;
more robust test of the effect of income than is usually the case. A&#13;
standard criticism of the use of per capita income in cross section work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 196 -&#13;
is that the same mean income can accompany greatly differing variances&#13;
(i.e. distributions of income). In this work, percent change in per&#13;
capita income is employed as the righthand variable. Thus, the income&#13;
measure can be said to apply equally to all members of a society as long&#13;
as the distribution of income remains roughly constant. Over a period as&#13;
short as a decade, this assumption is probably not too bad. The data&#13;
available for Western economies suggest that in most cases the&#13;
distribution of income has exhibited stability over periods as long as&#13;
fifty years.&#13;
Female Schooling: Female schooling rates have been derived from&#13;
information on female primary and secondary education ratios for 1960,&#13;
1970, and 1980. The female schooling rates relevant for the most&#13;
important age group (females from 15-29) during the 1970's have been&#13;
proxied by the female primary ratio in 1965 (calculated as the mean of&#13;
the rates for 1960 and 1970) and the female secondary ratio for 1970.&#13;
Rates for the 1960's are proxied by the primary and secondary ratios in&#13;
1960. Lags are employed here to reflect the period during which the women&#13;
should have been in primary or secondary school. Since prior&#13;
experimentation revealed no significant difference in impact&#13;
coefficients, schooling has been measured as the sum of the relevant&#13;
primary and secondary rates.&#13;
Family Planning: Family planning 'effort" by national governments&#13;
must be measured somehow. The original contribution to index number&#13;
construction in this context was made by Mauldin and Berelson (1978), who&#13;
derived a relative measure of program effectiveness for a large number of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 197 -&#13;
developing countries as of 1975. Data collection has continued, and I&#13;
have benefitted from the World Bank's possession of program effectiveness&#13;
indices for 1972 and 1982, along with estimated start dates for official&#13;
sponsorship of family planning programs. Only India began such&#13;
sponsorshop before 1960, so the presence of performance ratings for 1972&#13;
and 1982 allows for the estimation of changes in program effectiveness&#13;
during the 1960's and 1970's.&#13;
2). Results&#13;
The regression model fits the data quite well in this case (It&#13;
should be recalled that the lefthand variable is a percent change -- this&#13;
is a much more stringent test than that which is usually posed by&#13;
straight cross-section work).9 The schooling-planning interaction,&#13;
income per capita, and infant mortality all appear significant as&#13;
determinants of fertility change. For income per capita, the major&#13;
effect seems contemporaneous. For schooling-planning and infant&#13;
mortality, the results suggest somewhat more importance for the lagged&#13;
effect. One ambiguity is introduced by some doubt about whether&#13;
fertility change and change in infant mortality are simultaneously&#13;
determined. This problem will be considered again once the mortality&#13;
results are in hand.&#13;
Since per capita income and infant mortality enter the equation in&#13;
9. It is important to note that percent changes for all variables in the&#13;
fertility equation are measured in true units. Thus, one percent is&#13;
measured as .01.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 198 -&#13;
percent change form, their coefficients can be combined to give total&#13;
elasticity measures. For income per capita, the suggested total&#13;
elasticity is approximately .16 (that is, an increase of one percent in&#13;
income per capita is associated with a decline of approximately .16&#13;
percent in the total fertility rate). The total elasticity for infant&#13;
mortality is approximately .32, or twice that of per capita income.&#13;
The results for the schooling-planning interaction term are more&#13;
difficult to interpret because the relationship between this term and the&#13;
lefthand variable is implicitly log-linear rather than log-log. If&#13;
schooling is held constant at a value of 100 (e.g. Female primary&#13;
enrollment ratio of 80; female secondary ratio of 20), family planning&#13;
impact can be gauged using&#13;
(-o0018xlOO) Plan + (-.0021xlO0) LagPlan&#13;
or&#13;
(-.18) Plan + (-.21) LagPlan&#13;
The implied total responsiveness is a drop of .4% per 1 point&#13;
increase in the index of program effectiveness. The implication can be&#13;
seen by considering the impact of an increase of 80 (from zero up to the&#13;
current Chinese score, as China seems to have done in about a decade) for&#13;
a society with a total (and constant) female schooling ratio of 100 (not&#13;
atypical of African societies in the mid-1970's). The result is a 32%&#13;
drop in the total fertility rate. At a combined schooling ratio of 200&#13;
(the long-run maximum), the associated drop would be 64%. These are&#13;
impressive numbers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 199 -&#13;
An alternative interpretation of this result can be derived from a&#13;
consideration of the impact of educational improvements with the planning&#13;
score held constant. If the program effectiveness index were held&#13;
constant at 50, the implied coefficients on total schooling would be:&#13;
(-.09) School + (-.10) LagSchool&#13;
Thus, each 1 point increase in the total female primary and&#13;
secondary schooling ratio would decrease the fertility rate by about .2&#13;
%, and a 100 point increase would decrease fertility by about 20% in the&#13;
long run.&#13;
It is the interactive impact of education and family planning&#13;
which must be stressed here. Experimentation with alternative functional&#13;
forms has suggested strongly that the interactive specification is&#13;
appropriate. There is obviously a major policy implication in this&#13;
result if it is to be believed: Rapid expansion of family planning&#13;
programs in societies where females are being educated at low rates will&#13;
not be very effective. Conversely, rapid expansion in educational&#13;
opportunities for women seems to have proportionally greater impact on&#13;
fertility when strong family planning programs are in place.&#13;

C. Mortaliity&#13;
The mortality equation is specified in percent changes, again with&#13;
the exception of the time derivative of the schooling-planning&#13;
interaction. Prior theory suggests a treatment of lags which is&#13;
different than that for the fertility equation. If the standard&#13;
arguments are correct, than decennial changes in fertility and income&#13;
should have purely contemporaneous effects on mortality. The fertility&#13;
effect should come through increased child spacing, while the income&#13;
effect should register rather quickly through increased purchases of&#13;
health-related goods and services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 201 -&#13;
Since schooling and family planning activities may have lagged&#13;
effects on behavior, it seems appropriate to allow for this possibility&#13;
in the specified equation. In addition, the lagged infant mortality&#13;
change is introduced to allow for the the persistence of local (and at&#13;
this point, "unexplainable") patterns of infant mortality decline.&#13;
1). Results&#13;
All variables are as previously defined, with one exception.&#13;
Prior experimentation with the schooling variables showed that only&#13;
female secondary education had any apparent impact. Thus, DPS is&#13;
redefined as SecDPS here. The measures of percent change in per capita&#13;
income (PCI) and percent change in the fertility rate (Pert) are treated&#13;
as endogenous variables in the equation, as is the measure of&#13;
contemporaneous change in family planning effort.&#13;

This result suggests quite strongly that the fertility-mortality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 202 -&#13;
equation pair is recursive rather than truly simultaneous. The&#13;
hypothesis of no contemporaneous impact for fertility change cannot be&#13;
rejected at any reasonable level of confidence, given the results above.&#13;
The same can obviously be said for DPS (contemporaneous change in the&#13;
schooling-planning interaction) and PCI (contemporaneous change in per&#13;
capita income).&#13;
I*n fact, the result above suggests that an extremely simple model&#13;
can account for a large proportion of explained variance in infant&#13;
mortality (IMR) changes during the 1970's. When the weak variables are&#13;
dropped from the equation, it can be estimated by ordinary least squares:&#13;

Thus, three quarters of the variance in IMR changes can be&#13;
accounted for by an equation which incorporates lagged changes in the IMR&#13;
and the lagged change in the planning-schooling interaction. Obviously,&#13;
most of the movement remains "unexplained," in the usual sense. For the&#13;
present, this rather unsatisfactory result will be adopted to serve two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 203 -&#13;
purposes.&#13;
First, it will be incorporated into the simulation model as the&#13;
predictive equation for infant mortality change. Secondly, the result&#13;
seems to justify the treatment of infant mortality change as a&#13;
predetermined variable in the fertility change equation. The revised&#13;
fertility equation result is as follows:&#13;

The only change associated with the result is a complete shift in&#13;
explanatory weight from contemporaneous change in infant mortality to&#13;
lagged change. For incorporation into the simulation model, the equation&#13;
has been re-estimated without contemporaneous infant mortality change.&#13;
To summarize, then, the dominance of female education and family&#13;
planning in the determination of changes in both fertility and mortality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 204 -&#13;
is quite striking. Long lags in behavioral adaptation are suggested by&#13;
the results. The two-equation system seems fundamentally recursive, with&#13;
the only interaction occurring through a rather weak lagged impact of&#13;
infant mortality on fertility.&#13;
D. Family Planning&#13;
The results for changes in family planning effort are of some&#13;
independent interest here, since they exploit new measures of change in&#13;
family planning activity during the past two decades. The equation&#13;
relates changes in family planning to contemporaneous and lagged changes&#13;
in the fertility rate and per capita income. Change in the incidence of&#13;
female secondary education is also incorporated, along with the logarithm&#13;
of population density and the dummy variables for "small" and "large"&#13;
island-peninsular status.&#13;
The results are displayed below. Since the "island-peninsular"&#13;
variables had no apparent partial relationship to family planning change&#13;
during the 1970's, they have been dropped from the included results. The&#13;
definitions of new variables are as follows:&#13;
Plan - Change in family planning program score, 1970-80&#13;
FemSeced - Change in the female secondary schooling rate,&#13;
1960-70&#13;
lnDens - The logarithm of population density in 1970&#13;

As reported in the paper, these results suggest that government&#13;
planning efforts have been primarily reactive: Slow declines in fertility&#13;
have stimulated activity, while rapid declines in fertility seem to have&#13;
retarded it. The results also suggest that income, female education, and&#13;
perceived population pressure all had something to do with the change in&#13;
planning effort during the 1970's. When the weak variables are dropped&#13;
from the equation, the result is as follows:&#13;

            This paper addresses the key elements
            and changes in population policies and programs, including
            the strength of program effort, from 1972 to 1982. Using a
            new scale with thirty items to measure family planning
            program effort, the presentation is based on an analysis of
            over 300 questionnaires received from ninety-three
            countries. Attention is given to measurement problems and
            change in program effort 1972-82 (including findings by
            country and regional differences). This study shows that a
            great deal of family planning program effort exists in a
            small number of countries; moderate effort occurs in a
            larger number of countries; and weak or very little effort
            is found in an even greater number of countries, including
            many in the Middle East, North Africa and sub-Saharan
            Africa. Concerning change over time, between 1972 and 1982,
            there was a modest increase in program effort in more than
            half of the nearly 100 countries studied and a substantial
            increase in program effort in more than a third.
