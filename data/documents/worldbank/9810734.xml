                                            Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              C    an Africa afford to miss the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for&#13;
                                   sanitation, which aims at reducing the number of people who do not have&#13;
                              access to adequate sanitation by half? This question is even more pertinent given&#13;
                              that only eight years from 2015, many African countries are far from reaching&#13;
                              this target.&#13;
&#13;
                              TheUnitedNations(UN)hasdeclared2008the"InternationalYearofSanitation",&#13;
                              and the African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW), in collaboration with&#13;
                              its regional partners organized the Second African Conference on Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
 His Excellency Bruno Jean    and Hygiene (AfricaSan 2008) in February 2008. AfricaSan 2008 examined the&#13;
      Richard ITOUA           state of sanitation and hygiene in Africa, drew lessons from different experiences&#13;
                              and adopted a political statement and an action plan for the implementation of&#13;
strategies, policies and large-scale sustainable programs for reaching the sanitation MDG.&#13;
&#13;
This report provides an overview of the state of sanitation and hygiene in 32 African countries. It has been&#13;
prepared with the collaboration of the countries concerned. AfDB and WSP staff spared no effort in ensuring&#13;
that the report was ready on time for the IYS and I would like to thank the teams from both institutions for&#13;
their commitment.&#13;
&#13;
The conclusions of this report give reason for serious concern. The institutional framework for sanitation is&#13;
fragmented, the financing strategies are not sustainable, capacity is not sufficient, political commitment is&#13;
limited and projects remain on the shelves of the institutions which are involved with the different aspects&#13;
of sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
To put Africa back on track towards meeting the sanitation MDG, it is urgent that the parties concerned at&#13;
continental, sub-regional, national and local level engage in individual and collective efforts to speed up&#13;
progress to access to sanitation. The situation is not hopeless yet, but it is critical that action be taken now.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation is not just vital for health. It is also an investment with economic returns. It contributes to social&#13;
development and to the conservation of the environment. The experiences discussed in this report show that&#13;
there is an abundance of good ideas, of good will and of underused capacity on the continent.&#13;
&#13;
Africa cannot afford to miss the sanitation MDG. AWCOW subscribes to the messages of the International&#13;
Year of Sanitation and commits itself to providing the political leadership for making sanitation and hygiene&#13;
a top priority in the development agenda of the continent.&#13;
&#13;
I wish you all an excellent International Year of Sanitation.&#13;

Collecting information on sanitation and hygiene in African countries will be a permanent activity for WSP-&#13;
Africa in 2008. The AfricaSan conference in February offered the first opportunity to present the results of&#13;
this exercise. These results are still provisional, firstly because some countries are missing because of a lack&#13;
of information, and secondly because some reports are still in the validation phase at country level. The&#13;
methodology for collecting data and assessing the situation will be progressively improved and formalized.&#13;
Country reports will also be associated with relevant background data at country level, using an interactive&#13;
website hosted by WSP-Africa, AfDB and AMCOW.&#13;

E    very hour, a hundred African children die from diarrhea ­ so stated the final statement of the 2002&#13;
     AfricaSan conference. What has changed in the intervening 5 years? The 300 million Africans who did&#13;
not have access to basic sanitation and hygiene in 2002 have increased, and if current trends continue, by&#13;
2015, Africa will end up with 91 million more unserved than in 2004. For Africa to meet its Millennium&#13;
Development Goals (MDGs) for water supply and sanitation (WSS), the number of persons served must&#13;
more than double from 350 million in 2006 to 760 million by 2015. That still leaves almost 400 million&#13;
unserved.&#13;
&#13;
It is a daunting task, but one for which the benefit is clear: improved sanitation is intrinsically linked to poverty&#13;
reduction, and a measurable improvement in the health, social and economic status of populations.&#13;
&#13;
For the African continent, the WSP-Africa Sanitation Framework indicates that annual benefits for meeting&#13;
the sanitation MDG targets are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
· Diarrheacasesavoided:1,239,000&#13;
· Hoursgainedduetocloseraccesstosanitationfacilities:38,616,000&#13;
· Schooldaysgained(5-14agegroup):1,700,000&#13;
· Healthsectortreatmentcostsavoided(water-bornediseases):$1,130,000US&#13;
&#13;
Within the region, those without access to sanitation are among the poorest and most vulnerable, sanitation and&#13;
poverty go hand-in-hand; the richest are four times more likely to use improved sanitation than the poorest.&#13;
&#13;
Few countries in Africa are expected to attain their MDGs for sanitation, and it has been argued that for many&#13;
countries the figures are amplified due to an inadequate definition of basic sanitation. The African region&#13;
continues to bring up the rear in the global race towards the Millennium Development Goals not just in&#13;
&#13;

     Overview of sanitation and hygiene in Africa                                               2008             vii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
WSS but in all other sectors. This is not surprising when you examine the relationship that sanitation has to&#13;
development across the board, as recalled above by the UN Secretary-General.&#13;
&#13;
Thus the 2008 International Year of Sanitation (IYS) could not have come at a better time. It sheds the spotlight&#13;
on the sanitation crisis faced in Africa, and provides an opportunity to galvanize all stakeholders to accelerate&#13;
progress towards the MDG.&#13;
&#13;
The central objective of the International Year of Sanitation is to put the global community on track to achieve&#13;
the sanitation MDG. Progress requires broad cooperation through public and private partnerships, community&#13;
involvement and public awareness so that everyone can profit from the multiple benefits that spring from&#13;
better hygiene and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Most countries in the region have taken an active approach to meeting their sanitation MDGs. In fact, the&#13;
African region is one of the global leaders in finding innovative ways to provide sanitation services to the very&#13;
poor. Examples include sanitation marketing approaches being implemented in Benin, Tanzania, Uganda&#13;
and Malawi. In others, (Senegal, Kenya, Tanzania, Benin) the focus is not just on the provision of sanitation&#13;
hardware but also on the appropriate use, maintenance and hygiene behaviors associated with improved&#13;
sanitation. Innovation also extends to financing of sanitation (Burkina Faso surtax on water bills to finance&#13;
sanitation in poor urban settlements and Mozambique joint sector finance and planning), monitoring and&#13;
evaluation (Senegal's Sector Information Management System and Kenya's Citizen Report Cards) and national&#13;
strategies (Uganda has included sanitation in the Poverty Eradication Plan). As much as it is therapeutic to&#13;
list some of the highlights, the sad reality is that the list of problems remains much longer.&#13;

xii    2008    Can Africa Afford to Miss the Sanitation MDG Target?&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                          Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
W       ith 8 years to go, it is clear that most African countries are unlikely to reach their sanitation MDG&#13;
        targets unless approaches to sanitation change. This report is a synthesis of information collected from&#13;
32 African countries on the current status of their progress towards the sanitation MDG. The report has been&#13;
prepared with the collaboration of the countries concerned, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), as AMCOW's contribution to the International Year of Sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
For Africa to meet its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for water supply and sanitation (WSS) the&#13;
numberofpersonsservedmustdoublefrom350millionto700millionby2015andthatstillleaves200&#13;
million unserved. Africa not only lags behind other regions in achieving its Sanitation MDG but lags behind&#13;
in many of the other MDG targets. There should be no surprise about this; sanitation is a key building block&#13;
for health, the environment, education and gender equality. Improved sanitation offers a clear route to poverty&#13;
reduction and the improved health and economic status of populations.&#13;
&#13;
So why is sanitation not further up the priority list?&#13;
&#13;
This report identifies a range of problems contributing to the sanitation crisis faced by most African countries.&#13;
Africa is by no means `one' place, but the country profiles show some similarities in the issues faced by&#13;
the majority of sub-Saharan countries. One of the biggest problems is the overwhelming weight of on-site&#13;
sanitation, which places the emphasis for sanitation on households rather than service or utility providers.&#13;
Other issues arise from the pace of demographic growth and rapid urbanization and growth of informal&#13;
settlements; the sector has to run hard just to stay still in terms of the proportion of people it covers.&#13;
&#13;
All these elements (urbanization, population growth, on-site sanitation) are aggravated further by the extent&#13;
of poverty across the continent. The irony is that sanitation can considerably alleviate poverty, but because&#13;
of poverty and competing priorities such as education and health, sanitation is too far down the priority&#13;
list not only for households, but for local, regional and national&#13;
governments. Consequently, only about one third of Africa's&#13;
inhabitants have access to improved sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Contributing factors to the sanitation crisis&#13;
&#13;
Within the sector, there is fragmentation within and between&#13;
institutions; for example few countries have a ministry or&#13;
                                                                                                                  Asselin&#13;
department solely responsible for sanitation. Usually sanitation&#13;
is split between water, health and education ministries who take&#13;
responsibility for small pieces of the overall puzzle, but rarely is&#13;
there a lead organization coordinating the different roles. Thus&#13;
the sector is characterized not only by a complex chain of actors&#13;
but also a complex chain of operations from the disposal and                                                             UNICEF/HQ07-1010/Olivier©&#13;
collection of waste through to its treatment. Different players are&#13;
involved at different stages of the chain, and there is little or no                                                                              Source:&#13;
&#13;
coordination between them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Overview of sanitation and hygiene in Africa                                            2008             xiii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The report also highlights that there is still little agreement on what constitutes `improved sanitation'; this&#13;
continues to create problems from financing through to monitoring and evaluation. This ought to be a simple&#13;
problem to solve. However, the lack of political commitment given to sanitation globally, regionally and&#13;
nationally, coupled with the lack of attractiveness of the sector, generally means that many of these `simple'&#13;
problems continue.&#13;
&#13;
Another example is the need for national policies and strategies; one of the key recommendations of&#13;
AfricaSan 2002. Five years on, and although some progress has been made (as more countries have begun&#13;
this process) it is taking too long, and the quality of many of the documents is too low to adequately lead the&#13;
sector. In addition, where policies are separated from budgeting and financing, they are almost impossible&#13;
to implement.&#13;
&#13;
The profiles show that many countries have embarked on the process of devolving responsibilities for sanitation&#13;
to local authorities. However, this has often taken place without the necessary associated development of&#13;
local capacity and technical support. Capacity is not just a problem at local government level but one which&#13;
cripples the sector at every stage and even if all the other problems could be solved immediately, the capacity&#13;
issue will hold the sector back because of the time that is needed to train the required human resources.&#13;
&#13;
As would be expected, it is not only human resources which are problematic. Adequate financing of the&#13;
sectorisnotreflectedinnationalbudgets.Resultssuggestthatapproximately26billionUSDisneededto&#13;
achieve the national sanitation goals in Africa which means the investment pace needs to double. Although&#13;
studies have repeatedly shown return on investment is high for sanitation, since most investment happens at&#13;
the household level (because of on-site sanitation) it is hard to convince individuals of the benefits.&#13;
&#13;
Another issue identified in this report is the need to mobilize greater private sector involvement, and to plan&#13;
for this involvement in policies and strategies. In particular, small scale private businesses could play a greater&#13;
role in the sector if they were given more organizational and marketing assistance and had access to legal&#13;
security and credit.&#13;
&#13;
Although the predominant focus of sanitation is on the hardware, the evidence suggests that hygiene and&#13;
behavior change programs are essential to promoting proper use and maintenance of hardware as well as&#13;
improved hygiene and health behaviors. Countries do not have the capacity or skills to implement behavior&#13;
change programs which are given even less priority than sanitation hardware, and yet for which the evidence&#13;
is unequivocal in terms of the impact they can have on the sanitation disease burden.&#13;
&#13;
The final problem highlighted in this report is the problem of monitoring and evaluation. Universally the country&#13;
reports point to an absence of adequate monitoring and evaluation systems. The lack of M&amp;E is a reflection of&#13;
the institutional fragmentation and the lack of capacity and resources especially at the local level.&#13;
&#13;
The challenges Africa faces&#13;
&#13;
Although the emphasis of the first part of this report is on painting an honest and clear picture of the situation,&#13;
the report does shape these problems into a list of challenges that can potentially reverse the situation that&#13;
Africa finds itself in.&#13;
&#13;
The collation of the country reports not only allows for the identification of problems and issues but also&#13;
enables promising and innovative approaches to solving these problems to be shared. Thus, this report is not&#13;
only a list of problems and challenges but does provide hope by sharing concrete country experiences and&#13;
examples on topics ranging from institutional arrangements, and policies and strategies through to financing,&#13;
and innovation.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Using this report&#13;
&#13;
It is hoped that this report will become an important resource for those working in the sanitation sector in&#13;
Africa. It provides up-to-date comparative regional data as well as information on the strategic areas of&#13;
policies, institutional frameworks, financing and resources; capacity and M&amp;E. Most importantly this report&#13;
advocates for international and national pressure to commit resources and support for the sanitation sector&#13;
across Africa. Sanitation in Africa is everybody's business and requires us all to make a mighty effort if we&#13;
are to achieve the sanitation MDG.&#13;

&#13;
        2.        Develop sound policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
        3.        Prepare sustainable action and investment plans&#13;
&#13;
        4.        Put local authorities in the driving seat&#13;
&#13;
        5.        Build sector capacity with a focus on local players&#13;
&#13;
        6.        Integrate hygiene and sanitation behavior change&#13;
&#13;
        7.        Develop sustainable financing strategies&#13;
&#13;
        8.        Initiate partnerships with the private sector&#13;
&#13;
        9.        Encourage innovation, cooperation and R&amp;D&#13;
&#13;
        10. Monitor progress and evaluate impact&#13;

What are we talking about?&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation has many dimensions                           territory, the standards can be very different in the&#13;
                                                         formal and planned city centre and in the periphery&#13;
The definition of what is considered as `sanitation'     where the informal settlements are usually located,&#13;
can vary substantially from one country to another.      as illustrated below.&#13;
Sanitation can include excreta disposal, wastewater&#13;
management, industrial pollution, solid waste, rain      There is a large range of technical options for&#13;
and stormwater management, drainage as well as           sanitation. In all cases, the sanitation `chain' can also&#13;
hygiene and behavior change. MDGs focus primarily        be divided into three inter-related sub-chains: the&#13;
on two dimensions of sanitation that are directly        disposal and collection sub-chain; the transportation&#13;
related to public health; the safe disposal of excreta   sub-chain (vacuum trucks, sewer lines) and finally,&#13;
and domestic wastewater management. These two            the disposal and treatment sub-chain. In this&#13;
aspects are therefore the major focus of this report.    respect, sanitation offers more similarities to solid&#13;
                                                         waste than to water supply. Projects, policies and&#13;
Sanitation is a complex chain                            funds tend to focus more on the first sub-chain (the&#13;
of actors and operations                                 upstream part), but it is usually the whole chain&#13;
                                                         that needs to be considered and improved, and&#13;
Facilities and standards are not the same in rural       especially disposal and treatment (the downstream&#13;
areas and cities; and even within the same urban         part of the chain).&#13;

Sanitation is a business                                           site sanitation (see chart above). Throughout the&#13;
                                                                   continent, the large majority of households rely on&#13;
When you consider only the hardware aspects                        on-site sanitation facilities. On-site sanitation is&#13;
of sanitation ­ construction of latrines and sewer                 usually the only available technology in rural areas&#13;
systems, transportation of sludge out of the city,                 and small towns; this is actually not the result of a&#13;
wastewater and sludge treatment ­ all these tasks                  choice, but there are many good reasons to explain&#13;
in Africa are undertaken by a myriad of small scale                it:lowwaterconsumption(thatmakessewersystems&#13;
entrepreneurs. Urban households consider sanitation                non-viable from an engineering perspective),&#13;
as a service; they are globally ready to pay for it and            financial unsustainability and lack of capacity.&#13;
want to find sound and reliable providers. Despite&#13;
their role, private operators usually remain in the                WiththenotableexceptionofNorthernandSouthern&#13;
`shadow' of sanitation policies, and are not given                 Africa, even in capital cities, on-site sanitation&#13;
enough attention by policy makers. Sanitation is a                 remains the dominant technology, connection to&#13;
business1, but unlike many other businesses, it is a               a sewer network being a luxury reserved to a few&#13;
very underdeveloped field.                                         families living in the city centre or in compounds&#13;
                                                                   benefiting from an independent sewer system (such&#13;
The overwhelming weight                                            as industries, hotels and hospitals). This African&#13;
of on-site sanitation in Africa                                    feature has very important consequences, because&#13;
                                                                   it makes access to sanitation a domestic matter,&#13;
When comparing Africa with other continents, a                     rather than a service that can be purchased by the&#13;
striking characteristic is the predominance of on-                 community.&#13;

Policies and strategies                                    In secondary and capital cities, the problem is&#13;
­ only paper tigers?                                       quite different: municipalities are already providing&#13;
                                                           services; in some countries they invest in facilities,&#13;
Many African countries have recently been working,         manage sewer systems and treatment plants, offer&#13;
or are still working on preparing new strategies and       the services of vacuum trucks and even organize&#13;
policies for sanitation. This is a good sign, because      or participate in hygiene promotion and behavior&#13;
this increase of documents reflects political goodwill     change awareness campaigns. The issue then, is&#13;
and the urge to drive a framework for the sanitation       to build the capacity of municipal departments, to&#13;
sector by itself ­ sanitation is no longer considered      integrate sanitation into urban planning, to finance&#13;
a sub-sector of water supply or environmental              capital costs and to seek public-private partnerships&#13;
policies. Unfortunately, the quality of these policies     to improve the management of facilities and the&#13;
and strategies is variable; many are over ambitious        sound delivery of services.&#13;
as Governments attempt to attract new funds to the&#13;
sector. Ministries and governments sometimes have          Access: do we have a clear picture&#13;

staffed with the skilled personnel that are required.&#13;
At the national level, public institutions, that were&#13;
very much involved in operations, do not know how&#13;
to provide support to the local authorities; a new&#13;
mission they have not been trained for nor equipped&#13;
to accomplish. The lack of capacity at local/district&#13;
level is a point that is underlined in all the country&#13;
reports, even in countries known for the extent of&#13;

&#13;
Little progress will be made unless sanitation is                         There is a clearly identified need for new, sound and&#13;
pushed higher up the political agenda. We need clear                      immediately implementable policies and strategies.&#13;
commitment, and we need political will translated                         This means, first of all, working out the institutional&#13;
into action. As stated in the 2004 report published                       problems that hamper the efforts of the sanitation&#13;
by WHO, `National governments can seriously and                           sector. It involves identifying which institution takes&#13;
visibly act on their commitment to sanitation and                         the lead, and what other institutions are in charge&#13;
hygiene by commissioning a thorough review of                             of. It also implies a better integration of sanitation&#13;
policy and institutional arrangements; making explicit                    and hygiene/behavior change within the same&#13;

Challenge 3: Prepare sustainable action                       Challenge 6: Integrate hygiene and&#13;
                   and investment plans                                         sanitation behavior change&#13;
&#13;
The importance of a demand-driven approach needs              It is imperative to improve the links between&#13;
to be acknowledged, since this approach is central            sanitation, hygiene and health. Providing toilets&#13;
to the success and sustainability of the activities that      alone is not sufficient; targeted behavior change&#13;
will be implemented under any policy and strategy.            strategies are needed to promote hygiene and health&#13;
Households are already financing a big part of the            status in order to reduce the negative impact of the&#13;
sanitation facilities that are constructed; public money      lack of sanitation on public health and economic&#13;
should encourage this effort, and focus on financing          performance. Each sanitation program should&#13;
nation-wide awareness and hygiene behavior change             include a hygiene behavior change component.&#13;
campaigns to progressively create the demand for              In addition, hygiene education in schools should&#13;
new or improved sanitation. A stepwise approach is            be strongly encouraged. This integration has to be&#13;
key to the success of any action/investment plan.             reflected in the institutional arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
Challenge 4: Put local authorities                            Challenge 7: Develop sustainable&#13;
                   in the driving seat                                         financing strategies&#13;
&#13;
Nothing will happen at the local level if decentralized       More and better financing is needed. Financing&#13;
authorities are not involved and if they do not face          the sanitation sector should rely on sustainable&#13;
their new responsibilities. This is a huge shift in           mechanisms (for example a sanitation levy). Public&#13;
terms of sector organization and also in the way that         investment should concentrate on the bottlenecks&#13;
public bodies (including water and sewerage utilities)        within the sector, such as the treatment part of the&#13;
work on the ground; this challenge is directly linked         sanitation chain. Users should be responsible for all&#13;
to challenge 5. This will also necessitate a shift in         costs related to the operation of sanitation facilities.&#13;
budget allocation, because nothing will change in the         Subsidies cannot be excluded, provided that they are&#13;
role of local authorities if conditional funds are not        targeted and `intelligent' ­ financing tools must be&#13;
devolved from central government. This challenge              innovative (e.g. OBA) and user-focused.&#13;
is also linked to challenge 1, because we also need&#13;
political awareness at the local level.                       Challenge 8: Initiate partnerships&#13;
                                                                                with the private sector&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Challenge 9: Encourage innovation,                              This cannot be done without linking the sanitation&#13;
                   cooperation and R&amp;D                          sector with the institutions in charge of health.&#13;

The sanitation sector in Africa is slow to adopt                Encouraging perspectives&#13;

mechanisms. Successful stories that have been                   Raising political concern&#13;
identified across the continent must be scaled up&#13;
and experimented in other countries. In this respect,           Related challenges:&#13;
partnerships and intra-African cooperation must be              Challenge 1: Push sanitation higher up&#13;
encouraged, following the example of the support                                  the political agenda&#13;
from ONAS (Tunisia) to Mali, Burkina Faso and                   Challenge 4: Put local authorities in the driving seat&#13;

WSP and the AfDB is a useful tool to undertake the                    actions detailed in the plan below. This will enable&#13;
national assessment of current status. If necessary,                  more detailed progress to be measured, in addition to&#13;
countries can request support at the national level                   identifying challenges so that they can be addressed&#13;
from WSP and AfDB for the development of the CSR                      early. Countries need to be mindful of the need to&#13;

            Can Africa afford to miss the sanitation
            MDG target? A review of the sanitation and hygiene status in
            32 countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report documents both the progress
            and barriers facing countries in their quest to achieve
            their sanitation Water and Sanitation Program (MDG). Its
            purpose is to present an honest overview of the sanitation
            situation in the region based on 32 country assessments. The
            report identifies common challenges and issues across
            countries and discusses some possible solutions and options
            based on the innovations which are already taking place
            within the continent and elsewhere in the world. The lessons
            learned are important for replication and to help achieve
            scale and impact; these last two being crucial for MDG
            achievement in Africa. This report is likely to be a
            valuable resource for anyone working in the sanitation
            sector. It provides up-to-date comparative data for the
            region as well as information on strategic areas such as the
            national policies and institutional frameworks for
            sanitation within each country; financing and resources;
            capacity and monitoring and evaluation.
