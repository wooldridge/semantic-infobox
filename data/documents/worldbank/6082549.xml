"Policy makers should direct their attention above all to the education of youth." (Politics 8.1;&#13;
1337a1016). This document presents several arguments to support the statement postulated by Aristotle 25&#13;
centuriesago--theargumentofequityandaccessinChapterTwo,workandeconomicdevelopmentin&#13;
Chapter Three, and democracy and human development in Chapter Four.&#13;

        Box 2.1: EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOWER SECONDARY EDUCATION&#13;
                                                    IN HONDURAS&#13;
&#13;
 The Minister of Education of Honduras--as the education ministers of most countries that have increasing&#13;
 demands for lower secondary education and an unfinished primary school reform--faces puzzling dilem-&#13;
 mas. Available education indicators suggest that raising the quality of primary education is an urgent task.&#13;
 For example, only four of every ten children entering primary school graduate. Rural children do not have&#13;
 the same opportunities for access to primary education as do children living in urban areas, and interna-&#13;
 tional comparison shows that Honduras has one of the lowest standards of teacher preparation in the&#13;
 hemisphere.&#13;
&#13;
 However, quality primary education is not sufficient for responding to the development needs of the country.&#13;
 The education of the labor force of Honduras is well below that of most Latin American countries. A Chilean&#13;
 worker has more than nine years of education, while a Honduran worker has only four. The average produc-&#13;
 tivity of Latin American workers increased during the 1990s, but the productivity of the labor force of&#13;
 Honduras decreased during the same period.&#13;
&#13;
 Education of young people is a pillar of economic development and the best way to promote a rational use&#13;
 of natural resources. One of the lessons learned after Hurricane Mitch was that a long process of mountain&#13;
 deforestation had had a severe impact on watersheds and had contributed to obstruction of rivers. Inad-&#13;
 equate management of the nation's natural resources is contributing to repeated disasters and also threat-&#13;
 ening Honduras' rich bio-diversity.&#13;
&#13;
 In the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, Hondurans made the decision to move in two directions at the same&#13;
 time: to continue improving the quality of the first six grades of education, and to aggressively expand and&#13;
 transform middle school (grades 7 to 9) to reach an estimated 800,000 people, 15-30 years old.&#13;
&#13;
 Both formal and nonformal education strategies for middle schools are operating throughout the country with&#13;
 the purpose of serving diverse populations. Pilot sites for this broad learning enterprise are public schools,&#13;
 vocational centers, private households, community centers, hotels, and nongovernmental organizations.&#13;
 The main learning resources consist of facilitators, printed materials, radio programs, and networks of&#13;
 stakeholders. Private enterprises are beginning to support this effort by allowing time for their employees to&#13;
 participate and providing space and learning facilities.&#13;
&#13;
 This effort is based on the assumption that all children and youth can learn if provided the right learning&#13;
 context and on the long tradition of popular education in Latin America. However, it faces enormous quality&#13;
 challenges. One is the nature of the support system to be established; this system needs to be able to&#13;
 provide sufficient learning opportunities for very diverse populations. Secondly, the scientific and pedagogic&#13;
 quality of the curricular and instructional materials must be kept high, and finally the new system must&#13;
 develop the capacity to demonstrate learning results that meet recognized standards.&#13;

     Box 2.2 NEW EQUALITY ISSUES IN ROMANIAN SECONDARY EDUCATION REFORM&#13;
&#13;
  After 1989, Romania embarked on an ambitious and comprehensive reform of secondary education.&#13;
  Remarkable progress was made in reforming the curriculum: previously dominant political and ideological&#13;
  references were deleted from course content and textbooks, curricula were updated, and a flourishing&#13;
  private textbook industry has emerged. The rationale was to reform a system that previously adhered to an&#13;
  obsolete conception of development as expansion to increase equity. The new educational policy empha-&#13;
  sizes skills and training, rather than general education. Calls for education reform in response to the&#13;
  imperatives of "globalization" and acceptance to the European Union determined the Romanian Ministry of&#13;
  Education to modernize the curriculum to reflect contemporary European standards.&#13;
&#13;
  An important reform mandates that all students pass a new exam--the capacity exam, at the end of&#13;
  compulsory education. The intention of the capacity exam is to "filter" students for high school access.&#13;
  However, the majority of high schools, especially theoretical ones, with more candidates than the available&#13;
  number of seats, organize their own admissions tests, immediately following the capacity exam. As&#13;
  society often creatively responds to policy direction, in Romania the response has been a strengthening of&#13;
  the private tutoring system, which acts today as a parallel system to education. This parallel education&#13;
  system obligates the formal system to heighten its selection standards in order to meet the demand&#13;
  afforded by after-school tutoring. A major impetus for tutoring is students' anxiety with regard to these&#13;
  entrance exams.&#13;
&#13;
  Tutoring has become a business for many teachers. However, as a result of the reform certain subject&#13;
  matters, whose acquisition used to involve tutoring, have become less important (among them are physics,&#13;
  chemistry, history, biology, and even math). Also, not every math or Romanian language teacher is tutoring&#13;
  (selecting a tutor is based to a large extent on her/his prestige, experience, advertisement skills, and&#13;
  affability). There is thus an increasing social segregation in schools where achievement is differentiated&#13;
  according to a student's supplementary learning opportunities.&#13;

  The Minister of Education described this situation by stating that "the country needs a larger pool of highly&#13;
  trained, adaptable workers in the labor market who are able to improve the nation's productivity, its trading&#13;
  position and living standard in the 21st century. The current system of a two-track secondary education&#13;
  program has caused a division between academic preparation and technical education for the workplace that&#13;
  is not consistent with our current reform goals. Greater flexibility in the courses of study, which encourages&#13;
  student choice, is planned. It is also our desire to maintain social cohesion and cultural tradition."&#13;
&#13;
  The problems identified in Egyptian secondary education are common to several countries:&#13;
&#13;
    l   A problem of structure. The two-track system of general and technical schools provides neither a good&#13;
        general education, nor technical skills relevant to the evolving labor market.&#13;
    l   A problem of curriculum. Courses in technical education are obsolete, and academic courses need to&#13;
        be updated and adapted to include work skills development.&#13;
    l   A problem of evaluation. The system as a whole lacks adequate institutional mechanisms for quality&#13;
        improvement. For example, the current inspectorate does not provide technical support to schools,&#13;
        and examinations do not measure critical outcomes of the system.&#13;
    l   A problem of management. Excessive centralization and lack of incentives hamper innovation and&#13;
        change.&#13;
&#13;
  To resolve the problem of structure, three main approaches were considered: First, strengthening the&#13;
  existing system; second, unifying the general and technical schools in a comprehensive system, offering&#13;
  both general and technical courses in the same schools; and finally, maintaining both types of schools and&#13;
  improving the system by developing a common curriculum in selected core courses as well as new elec-&#13;
  tives. The third option was accepted as the most technically and politically feasible.&#13;
&#13;
  The reform of secondary education includes new policies and programs to be implemented in the next two&#13;
  decades. The reform addresses the problems identified above and creates a secondary education system&#13;
  that maximizes opportunities for a large number of Egyptian students by combining a core of good general&#13;
  education courses, including computer literacy, with market-oriented education options and wider opportuni-&#13;
  ties to progress towards higher education.&#13;
&#13;
  The main components of the new strategy to improve secondary education are two: (1) improving quality&#13;
  and opportunity, and (2) strengthening institutional capacity. The first component includes the conversion of&#13;
  over 300 commercial schools to general schools to reach an even distribution of 50 percent general and 50&#13;
  percent technical schools; the re-design of curriculum frameworks for technical and general schools; and the&#13;
  provision of equipment and professional development to integrate technology into classroom practice. The&#13;
  second component supports community and private sector involvement in schools, the training of school&#13;
  managers, and the development of new quality assurance mechanisms.&#13;

               Box 2.4: LEARNING FROM THE MISTAKES OF SECONDARY SHOOLS&#13;
                                               IN THE UNITED STATES&#13;
&#13;
  The achievements and challenges of education in the United States are among the best documented in the&#13;
  world. U.S. graduate schools attract students from all over the world. Primary education is also quite&#13;
  successful. But secondary education is a different story. Graduation rates and school achievement lag&#13;
  behind several European and EastAsian countries. Why? The proximate causes of poor performance of&#13;
  secondary schools in the United States may be attributed to three factors--teacher quality, student engage-&#13;
  ment, and school culture.&#13;
&#13;
  The academic ability of secondary school teachers consistently predicts student learning. However, teach-&#13;
  ing secondary school in the United States does not attract the kind of talent that is attracted into the&#13;
  profession in several European and East Asian countries where admission criteria are higher. And, as&#13;
  happens in several other countries, American teachers are generally not the most talented members of the&#13;
  pool of college graduates.&#13;
&#13;
  Classroom observation studies reveal that U.S. students engage in learning activities for only about half the&#13;
  time students are scheduled to be in a classroom. Many teachers rank lack of student interest as the most&#13;
  important problem in education. A peer culture exists that is hostile to studiousness and public display of&#13;
  enthusiasm for academic learning. Good students are called "nerds." Most students prefer easy courses,&#13;
  and teachers are not able to resist the pressure to lower standards from the school culture and sometimes&#13;
  from administrators and parents.&#13;
&#13;
  External rewards for learning, such as external examinations, graduation requirements, or learning stan-&#13;
  dards for admission in the job market, are not provided. National standards and curriculum-based exams&#13;
  would serve to focus the attention of students, parents, teachers, universities, and employers on absolute&#13;
  school-learning objectives.&#13;

balancing supply and demand, between the labor market and the school system. Either the labor market&#13;
requires more, or different, skills than those produced by the school system, or the market may not be&#13;
developed enough to absorb the numbers of secondary school graduates that the system is producing.&#13;
Therefore, the balance between the labor market and the school system is critical.&#13;

themostgeneralsense,globalizationreferstothetransnationalexpansionofbusinessenterprisesthrough&#13;
trade, investment, and joint ownership. In terms of the impact on countries, this can be a double-edged&#13;
sword. Ontheonehand,internationalinvestmentcanprovidenotonlynewemploymentopportunities,but&#13;
alsothetransferoftechnologiesandmanagementapproachesthatareotherwiseforeigntothecountry. This&#13;
can create an accelerated "pull," or demand, for a more highly educated workforce. On the other hand, the&#13;

ization debates for the past several years, such as the impact on environmental protection, labor laws and&#13;
safety,childlabor,andincomedistribution.&#13;
&#13;
The net impact of these many forces of globalization is a subject of considerable debate. What is not&#13;
debatable, however, is that all of these forces vastly accelerate the pace of change and the introduction of&#13;
neweconomyissuesintoothercountries. Ofcourse,thisentireglobalizationprocessdirectlyinvolvesthe&#13;

This is not a challenge that most school systems even in developed countries have been able to address&#13;
effectively. In 1991, a U.S. Department of Labor report found that half of the students in the United States&#13;
left school without the needed skills and knowledge.3 An important part of this report, issued by the&#13;

                        BOX 3.1: LANSING AREA MANUFACTURING PARTNERSHIP&#13;
&#13;
  Launched in 1997, the LansingArea Manufacturing Partnership (LAMP), located in Lansing, Michigan, has&#13;
  established itself as a model school-to-work initiative. Three key partners, the Ingham Intermediate School&#13;
  District, the UnitedAuto Workers (UAW), and the General Motors Corporation (GM), form LAMP. Together,&#13;
  these partners developed and launched a unique program designed to provide young people with exposure&#13;
  to all aspects of the automotive manufacturing industry.&#13;
&#13;
  The LAMP classroom is housed within the UAW/GM Training Center, which affords students easy access to&#13;
  manufacturing facilities, resources, and employees. Students attend LAMP for 2.5 hours every school day&#13;
  during their senior year. The LAMP classroom enrolls a diverse mix of students with different ethnic,&#13;
  gender, socioeconomic, and academic backgrounds representing twenty-five high schools and three&#13;
  different school districts.&#13;
&#13;
  The program is driven by an integrated curriculum, collaboratively developed by educators from the Ingham&#13;
  Intermediate School District and UAW and GM representatives. Six units of study integrate academic&#13;
  standards and employability skills within a manufacturing context. The curriculum is delivered through a&#13;
  blended combination of classroom instruction, work-based learning, hands-on experiences, team projects,&#13;
  and interactions with UAW/GM personnel, including mentors.&#13;
&#13;
  A trio of certified instructors delivers the curriculum as a team. Drawn from the local school districts, they&#13;
  have academic backgrounds in math, science, communication and business. Team teaching makes it&#13;
  possible for teachers to model teamwork, offer different perspectives on information, learn from one an-&#13;
  other; and provide better oversight on field trips to the plants.&#13;
&#13;
  Throughout the year, student progress is assessed along traditional academic dimensions as well as&#13;
  employment competencies such as teamwork, problem-solving, and communication skills. Students&#13;
  demonstrate knowledge through traditional tests and written assignments, but are also graded on team&#13;
  presentations and through teacher observation. The course of study culminates in a "Capstone Experience"&#13;
  in which student teams research authentic workplace problems using the skills and know-how they devel-&#13;
  oped throughout the year. They present their findings to an audience of educators, parents, and workplace&#13;
  personnel using multimedia in a simulated professional workplace presentation.&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
Theneweconomy,globalization,andthestructureofaparticulareconomyrepresentchallengesforcoun-&#13;
tries at all income levels to structure their secondary education system to prepare youth for the world of&#13;
work.Job-specificskillsareneeded,buttheseskillsarecontinuallychanging.Employersincreasinglywant&#13;
their workers to possess more generic work-readiness skills, such as the ability to problem-solve and work&#13;
inteams.&#13;
&#13;
How schools prepare their students for the workplace has varied, particularly as some students will go on to&#13;
university,sometovocationalortechnicaltraining,andsomedirectlytotheworkplace.Threegeneral&#13;
models--a comprehensive secondary school system, separate tracks, and a dual system--deal with these&#13;
challengesindifferentways.&#13;
&#13;
Communication between schools and employers has not been as strong as it could be. As a result, schools&#13;
might not know the skills that employers need from their workers, and employers do not have a means to&#13;
evaluatethereadinessofnewgraduates.&#13;

focuson"fixing"secondaryschoolmightinappropriatelyisolateitfromthebroadereducationalsystem,to&#13;
the detriment of all. The secondary level serves as an interface between the "basic" education of the pri-&#13;
mary grades and the technical, vocational, or academic education of the workplace and post-secondary&#13;
education. Aholisticapproachtodevelopingacoordinated,integratededucationalsystemthatcontinuously&#13;

                          BOX 4.1: SUPPORTING SCHOOL CHANGE IN POLAND&#13;
&#13;
 Schools are remarkably stable and traditional organizations in all countries. Implementing content and&#13;
 methodology reforms in school teaching has proved difficult. Sometimes school reforms can be facilitated&#13;
 by external factors, such as textbooks or competition, or by intervention programs as suggested in Poland.&#13;
 In the past, most Polish schools have provided a rigid education that discourages open communication and&#13;
 students' individuality. Launched in 1987, Spojrz Inaczej (Look at It in a Different Way) is a project of the&#13;
 Healthy School Association in Poland to support school change. It aims to develop young people's problem-&#13;
 solving, self-reliance, and relationship skills. Equally important, it seeks to change the authoritarian relation-&#13;
 ship between teachers and students.&#13;
&#13;
 The project trains teachers and, in special weekly classes, encourages students to participate more&#13;
 actively in their own education. Look at It has had a significant impact on participating youth. They behave&#13;
 less aggressively and are more likely to solve conflicts using peaceful means. Furthermore, they abide by&#13;
 school rules better than those youth that do not participate. Teachers who run the program also note&#13;
 improved school performance, with all participants being promoted to a higher grade. Each year, Poland's&#13;
 Ministry of Education has endorsed Look at It as one of the country's best preventive initiatives for children.&#13;
 The challenge for this and similar school-based youth programs is to keep evolving and energizing the&#13;
 schools' internal dynamics to adapt to a changing external social environment.&#13;

 experiment grew into a full-fledged alternative education program for street children and youth. The evolu-&#13;
 tion of the program over the years has responded to the changing needs of the young people. The program&#13;
 has had several phases.&#13;
&#13;
 In 1974, the Boys' Republic, also known as La Florida, was established to allow boys ages 14-20 the&#13;
 chance to test their leadership skills, ability to cooperate with peers, and sense of responsibility through a&#13;
 self-governed vocational school program. In 1976, the final stage of the program, La Industria, was estab-&#13;
 lished to provide boys with the technical and microenterprise training necessary to successfully enter the&#13;
 workforce. The program continues to adapt to new situations.&#13;
&#13;
 In 1980, Juventud Unidas, a residential program for girls, was opened. Young girls live on-site until they&#13;
 finish the equivalent of high school, usually between ages 18-20. Many of the girls who have left the&#13;
 program have become educators for other street children and youth. Others have married young men from&#13;
 Bosconia or La Florida. More than 300 young people graduate from the program every year. Several of&#13;
 these graduates have received scholarships to study abroad.&#13;
&#13;
 This program shows the potential adaptation of the school model to diverse youth populations and the&#13;
 needs that comprehensive youth programs can meet by providing opportunities for acquiring basic cognitive&#13;
 tools, job skills, and social values to youth who would otherwise be left behind.&#13;

              BOX 4.3: SCHOOLS LEARNING TOGETHER THROUGHOUT THE WORLD&#13;
&#13;
  New technologies are providing alternatives for schools and other learning programs to work together.&#13;
  Initiatives emerge and evolve rapidly in somewhat unexpected directions and dimensions. For example, the&#13;
  International Education and Resource Network (I*EARN) began in 1988 when twelve schools in Moscow&#13;
  were linked via the Internet to schools in New York to enhance school learning through interactive projects.&#13;
  By 2000, students and teachers in about 4,000 schools in more than 90 countries worked online in an&#13;
  I*EARN global learning community on projects designed to meet curriculum needs in the areas of art and&#13;
  literature, social studies, mathematics, science, and environment. In the First People project, for example,&#13;
  indigenous youth from Argentina,Australia, Hungary, the United States, and Thailand share their life&#13;
  experiences and culture. Another project, Global Art, promotes a virtual museum in which students exhibit&#13;
  their artwork. Schools Online has provided Internet equipment and training to over 5,000 schools in coun-&#13;
  tries with scarce resources.&#13;
&#13;
  I*EARN is designed to include youth service organizations and human and environmental development&#13;
  agencies, as well as teachers, students, and families. Each country brings its own plans, programs,&#13;
  publications, news, and practices to the network, and the network facilitates dialogue via e-mail, online&#13;
  conferences, video conferences, and meetings. Some projects are conducted in several languages so&#13;
  students may participate in discussions or improve second-language skills. Teachers and students design&#13;
  and implement global surveys on themes of youth and school interest. Partners include schools, ministries&#13;
  of education, small local businesses, and the World Bank.&#13;

&#13;
 Secondary school students who register for English courses in eight French-speaking provinces of&#13;
 Cameroon are also learning important life skills. Raps, songs, games, and poems serve to identify environ-&#13;
 mental factors related to healthy behaviors and to discuss lifestyle changes that are the best prevention&#13;
 against HIV infection. English teachers are collaborating with other professionals to learn about health&#13;
 issues and how to achieve long-term behavioral change in Cameroonian youth. By integrating HIV/AIDS&#13;
 prevention with other subjects within the existing school structure, the program maximizes the established&#13;
 resources, staff, and training, thus contributing to sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
 Preliminary evaluations involving provincial inspectors and teachers, as well as the Institut de Recherche et&#13;
 des Etudes de Comportement, suggest encouraging results. The extent of the results depends on external&#13;
 factors--such as commitment by ministry officials and collaboration with a wide range of groups and&#13;
 organizations--and internal factors of the program such as a participatory approach and teacher orientation.&#13;

                                     BOX 4.5: NATION BUILDING IN SINGAPORE&#13;
&#13;
 Singapore's education system is an important component in the Singapore government's economic and&#13;
 nation-building strategy. Given Singapore's lack of natural resources, the country's population has become&#13;
 its most important resource. The Singapore government believes it provides quality education to its people,&#13;
 citing an increasing percentage of secondary school graduates that enter Singapore's public universities.1&#13;
&#13;
 The education system in Singapore is distinctive for its highly centralized and examination-oriented nature.&#13;
 The educational system has traditionally focused on national education as a factor for developing national&#13;
 cohesion and civic responsibility. Programs such as the Community Involvement Program, conducted on a&#13;
 whole-school approach, focus on citizenship building and active participation of students in the life of the&#13;
 community in which they live, and provide a platform for students to play a part in nation building.&#13;
&#13;
 In recent years, the Government of Singapore has initiated reforms in its education system that are in-&#13;
 tended to facilitate Singapore's transformation into a "knowledge-based economy" and to meet the new&#13;
 challenges posed by globalization and increased competition. At the Junior College and Upper Secondary&#13;
 Education level, the proposed changes aim at a broader and more flexible curriculum focusing on thinking&#13;
 and communication skills and a more diverse educational landscape introducing integrated programs,&#13;
 alternative curricula, and more private-funded schools. The government thus seeks to nurture the skills,&#13;
 spirit and values required for Singaporeans to thrive in a more globalized and innovation-driven future.2&#13;

                    BOX 4.6: CIVIC EDUCATION IN RUSSIAN SECONDARY SCHOOLS&#13;
&#13;
  School environment in the new Russia reflects the profound and unfinished social and political transition of&#13;
  the last decade. Civic education is evolving slowly amidst great contradictions, opposing trends, and&#13;
  institutional reforms as new values of democracy and pluralism begin to replace those of traditionalism and&#13;
  collectivism. The intensity of change being experienced by Russian citizens in a short time is described as&#13;
  overwhelming. The role of schools in the creation of a new civic culture is critical for the formation of a&#13;
  national and ethnic identity, as well as for new patterns of socialization.&#13;
&#13;
  Civic education is provided in Russian secondary schools via many disciplines, particularly history and&#13;
  social sciences. The challenge for individual growth is to reinvigorate both content and teaching methods in&#13;
  Russian classrooms while old social science paradigms still remain influential and to provide opportunities&#13;
  for youth to take part in political and social life. For the country as a whole, the challenge is to build a&#13;
  healthy national civil society that combines cultural and spiritual traditions of the many groups within Russia&#13;
  with the demands of global citizenship.&#13;

projects like the recycled tennis ball business (Box 5.1) can be done on a computer at school or in a&#13;
community access center. Students'access to computers is growing rapidly worldwide.Astudy completed&#13;
in September 2000 by the Angus Reid Group polled 10,000 youth ages 12-24 in 16 countries. Of the&#13;
countries polled, Sweden and Canada had the largest percentage (74 percent) of students surfing, or using,&#13;
the Web at school. In comparison, only 59 percent of U.S. youths said they surf theWeb at school, most&#13;
going online at home instead. In Taiwan, 63 percent of students polled said they use the Internet at school,&#13;
while only 45 percent access the Internet from home. Whether from school or home, students are using the&#13;
Internet for school-related research and projects. In urban China, only 13 percent of the students reported&#13;
having access to theWeb at school and even fewer, 9 percent, can access the Web at home. But more than&#13;
25 percent of urban Chinese students said they have used theWeb to complete school assignments.1&#13;

          BOX 5.1: SECONDARY STUDENTS EXPLORING, LEARNING, AND INVENTING&#13;
&#13;
  Teenagers Alec Zopf and Lloyd Cargo noticed hundreds of old tennis balls lying in a ditch behind the tennis&#13;
  courts at the YMCA in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, suburb where they live. Alec wondered whether the&#13;
  balls could be recycled instead of littering the landscape. The boys offered the balls for sale on eBay, a&#13;
  popular Internet auction site, and discovered a niche market--teachers who wanted to slip punctured tennis&#13;
  balls on the metal feet of chairs to deaden noise. The balls sold so fast the boys decided to start their own&#13;
  e-business. They paid $35 to bootbox.net to host and register their Website, http://www.recycledballs.com.&#13;
  The boys used a word processor (Microsoft Word) to edit text for their site, taught themselves html pro-&#13;
  gramming language, and took advantage of 30-day free trials of Web-authoring software they downloaded&#13;
  from the Internet.&#13;
&#13;
  Alec continues to run the business. To meet the demand of e-mail requests to his Website, he buys used&#13;
  tennis balls at a cost of $10 per 100 balls and resells the balls at $.25 each. He says his biggest problem is&#13;
  keeping enough balls in stock to meet surges of demand, the very problem that bankrupted so many "dot-&#13;
  coms" during the December 2000 holiday season.Alec doesn't advertise, but he has earned back his&#13;
  venture capital of $35 and more. His mother says, "This business is very small. It's in the category of a&#13;
  lemonade stand, except it's on the Internet. But Alec has learned so much!"&#13;
&#13;
  What has he learned? Most importantly, he says, "It's not that hard to run a business." Along the way, he&#13;
  learned a number of computer applications, managed money, honed his writing skills, had an informal&#13;
  introduction to global economics, cleaned up litter in his community--and helped hundreds of teachers&#13;
  avoid headaches by quieting their classrooms! At age 14, Alec Zopf is a true "knowledge worker," the&#13;
  problem-solving, tech-savvy, constantly learning, adaptable team player that employers say they are&#13;
  looking for. He learned by exploring, collaborating, experimenting, and inventing on a home computer.&#13;

Youngsters in developing countries, too, are drawn to computers like ducks to water.The actual numbers&#13;
with access to computers may lag those in the OECD countries, but the demand is growing, and education&#13;
leaders feel pressure to bring computers into schools. Because most teachers and school administrators lack&#13;
the time to attend courses or to learn to use computers on their own through trial and error as the young are&#13;
doing,educatorsmayunderstandonlyvaguelywhatcomputerscancontributetoteachingandlearning.This&#13;

students developed flow charts and BASIC programs on paper with only rare opportunities to run pro-&#13;
grams on actual computers. These early courses seemed unrelated to other subjects, more akin to voca-&#13;

&#13;
As personal computers (PCs) increased in speed and processing power, and prices fell, certain operating&#13;
systems (DOS, Windows, Macintosh) and applications (word processing, spreadsheets, databases) be-&#13;
came standard tools in more and more businesses. The trend to invest in school computers and to teach&#13;

&#13;
Stand-alone Labs&#13;
&#13;
A stand-alone computer lab (a group of computers without connection to the Internet or to computers in&#13;
other parts of the school) is still the cheapest way to introduce students of any age to basic computer skills.&#13;
Many school projects may be accomplished by having a group of students share a computer, but each&#13;
studentneedsindividualpracticeinkeyboarding(typing,plustheuseofspecialcomputerkeys)andfile&#13;

&#13;
Handheldcomputers--PersonalDigitalAssistants(PDAs)likethePalmPilotandHandspringVisor,or&#13;
Pocket PCs like the Compaq IPAQ and Casio PocketViewer--offer another way to give every student&#13;
some hands-on practice at lower cost. In addition to the address book, calendar, "to do list," and memo&#13;

boards are available that make word processing almost as comfortable as on a full-size PC. Files can be&#13;

Sequence of Learning&#13;
&#13;
As the amount to be learned about technology has grown, some school systems have developed an articu-&#13;

early as first grade. However, for countries where the cost of Internet access is high and calculated by the&#13;
minute,itmakesnosensetohaveyoungchildrenspendinghoursonlineexploringtheWeb.Instead,online&#13;
access can be a privilege earned by mastering a sequence of more basic concepts and technology skills.&#13;

paper costs money, including blank space. Color printing costs far more than black and white. So there is a&#13;
temptation to keep cost down by crowding more text on each page than is comfortable to read and printing&#13;
and storing very large quantities of books. Storage costs money, but even worse is the need to keep using&#13;
thesamebookwhenitsinformationisnolongeraccurate.Increatingdigitalmedia,someextracostmaygo&#13;

Color illustrations, sound, and video take much more computer memory than text, but CD-ROMs have&#13;
huge memory capacity. CDs are cheap material, take far less shelf space to store than the same information&#13;
in book form, and are cheap to ship. Recording, or "burning," a CD-ROM costs no more per copy for a&#13;
smallquantitythanforavastquantity.AhugeillustratedbookcanevenbesentthroughtheInternetand&#13;

&#13;
Fordevelopingcountriesinwhichtheministryofeducationproducesallthetextbooksusedinschools,&#13;
theseeconomicfactorsarecompelling.UnlikecommercialpublishersthatkeepthecostofCD-ROM&#13;
books high to protect sales of printed books, an education ministry can take full advantage of the cost&#13;
saving of digital media. Text-only books are easily converted to compressed documents that can be down-&#13;
loaded quickly from the Internet and printed.Teachers may choose to duplicate only a key part of a chapter&#13;
for students to study at home, instead of providing an entire textbook for each student. As schools acquire&#13;
computersandInternetconnections,itbecomesfeasibletoprovideengaging,colorful,andup-to-date&#13;
textbooks on CD-ROM and/or aWebsite at lower cost than printing them.&#13;
&#13;
Digital Tools&#13;
&#13;
Unlike a typewriter, a word processor allows a writer to make changes easily, to try saying things one way&#13;
and then another, and to see how it looks before committing a word to print.Those advantages of manipula-&#13;
tion and preview are the educational key to the power of digital tools, including spreadsheets, databases,&#13;
publishingprograms,geographyinformationsystems,Computer-AidedDesign(CAD),drawingandpaint-&#13;
ingprograms,andmore.Graphingcalculators,smallhandheldcomputersthatonlyperformcalculationsand&#13;

Allofthesetoolsallowtheusertoexperimentwith"whatif...?"possibilities.Theyaretoolsforthinking&#13;
and active learning. Word processor: What if I move this sentence, reorganize this paragraph? Will my&#13;
meaning be clearer? Graphing calculator: What if I change the equation from 2x-3=5 to 2x+3=5?&#13;
How will the graph change? Spreadsheet: What if we spend $3 instead of $4 on food per person for&#13;
our school party? Then would our budget let us hire a band? Human beings construct their own knowl-&#13;
edgebypredicting,experimenting,andrefiningunderstandingwithjustthiskindofthinking.&#13;
&#13;
Another advantage of many of these tools is that they allow students to produce documents that look&#13;

Many large secondary schools now have one or more computer labs that serve as study halls, where&#13;
students may go to prepare assignments, in addition to a lab dedicated to teaching about technology.&#13;
Another trend is to have a computer in each classroom equipped with a way to enlarge the monitor's image&#13;
so all can see it--with a projector, a large digital display, or aTVwith adapter.Amore affordable solution&#13;
is a rolling cart with computer,TV, and adapter to be borrowed by classroom teachers or to be set up in a&#13;
room reserved for presentations and used in turn by many teachers and their classes. The computer then&#13;
becomesan"electronicblackboard"withwhichtheteachercanguidestudentdiscussionof"whatif...?"&#13;

Web browsers and other digital tools used on the Internet have an important role in academic studies as well&#13;
as in courses about technology. If a classroom has one computer, a large display and access to the Internet,&#13;
the teacher can guide the entire class in a "WebQuest" investigation. Pioneered by Bernie Dodge at San&#13;

                 BOX 5.2: COLLABORATION UNITING MEMBERS OF A DIASPORA&#13;
&#13;
  The Three Pomegranate Network, or 3PN, links students inArmenia with peers in theArmenian diaspora&#13;
  worldwide. Participating students are ages 14-16 in seventy schools in sixteen countries.About half the&#13;
  students live in Yerevan and two smaller cities in Armenia. On the 3PN Website (http://www.3noor.org ),&#13;
  students find Aren and Areni, a virtual boy and girl who introduce them to the year's projects. The 1999-&#13;
  2000 school year featured three collaborative learning activities: Exploring Yerevan, Identity Game, and&#13;
  Moving People. All three activities explore Armenian culture, history, and social issues related to Armenian&#13;
  migration to other countries. The activities challenge the students to gather information in local communi-&#13;
  ties and from other Websites in addition to 3PN and sources in their classrooms.&#13;
&#13;
  The 3PN activities involve students in learning computer and information literacy skills. They use e-mail&#13;
  and word processing not in isolation but in a project that involves doing original research in social science,&#13;
  problem solving and critical thinking, collaborating in a small group and with distant partners, and contribut-&#13;
  ing to an information product (the Website) for an outside audience. The projects enliven traditional school&#13;
  subjects: writing, history, geography, and other social sciences.&#13;
&#13;
  The classroom teachers participating in 3PN do not receive special compensation for this work. They are&#13;
  volunteers for whom the activities have personal appeal. The chance to learn to use technology effectively&#13;
  was an important incentive. One secret to the success of the 3PN activities is that the classroom teachers&#13;
  have support from a technology coordinator, a technician or a computer literacy teacher. The teacher can&#13;
  concentrate on the learning activities knowing that help is available in the event of computer glitches.&#13;

Web-based Courses&#13;
&#13;
Distance education has long held the promise of extending education to people in places too remote, too&#13;
sparsely populated, or too poor to provide a good teacher to those who want to learn. In higher education&#13;
especially, there have been successful efforts to provide courses by radio, satelliteTVbroadcast, and&#13;
interactiveradioandtelevision.Somecourseshavebeeninnovativeinapproach,buttheusualpatternhas&#13;
been the traditional lecture, with all the limitations of that method. The cost of TV broadcast as opposed to&#13;

                BOX 5.3: A SHOWCASE FOR STUDENTS AS KNOWLEDGE WORKERS&#13;
&#13;
  Two 15-year-old girls in Uganda collaborated with a 14-year-old boy in Singapore, with coaching from a&#13;
  public school teacher in the United States and a local Ugandan computer programmer, to create a fine&#13;
  Website called Conflict and Refugees: A Global Problem. Nantongo Rose and her classmate Rachael&#13;
  Wanyana live in a suburb of Kampala, where they have witnessed firsthand the plight of refugees from&#13;
  Rwanda, Sudan, and Somalia. The girls began learning computer skills as participants in Students Under-&#13;
  standing Information Technology (SUIT), a project initiated by Ronald Kanyerezi, a young programmer&#13;
  working for a Ugandan company called Cyber Base Limited. He introduced the girls to Web browsing and&#13;
  encouraged them to build a Web page and enter the 1999 ThinkQuest contest.&#13;
&#13;
  When the work proved difficult, Nantongo kept Rachael involved mainly by example and urgent persuasion.&#13;
  Natongo's strong desire to help refugees is clearly stated on her Web page: "I hope the page will offer the&#13;
  reader some starting or basic insight into what we see and what others are doing so that (readers) can also&#13;
  build on it and make our WORLD a refugee-free `Global Village.'"&#13;
&#13;
  Through ThinkQuest, the girls met 14-year-old Tan KeeYee of Singapore and a second coach, George&#13;
  Cassuto, a teacher at North Hagerstown High School in Maryland. Tan Kee Yee, who was enrolled in a&#13;
  special program called the Computer TDP (talent development program) at the Chinese High School in&#13;
  Singapore, contributed what Natongo calls the "great graphics and page designing" for her refugee project.&#13;
  Tan Kee Yee was not interested in the topic initially but says, "After seeing what my dedicated coaches Ron&#13;
  and George were doing for the team, I knew I had to complete this project. I had the most experience in&#13;
  Web designing and graphic designing and thus I took up the challenge to be the webmaster of our site."&#13;
&#13;
  Cassuto volunteers his time to coaching distant students by e-mail because he believes the Internet holds&#13;
  the key to reforming education: "As the Web has become an increasingly important aspect of education,&#13;
  my teaching . . . has shifted towards computer instruction. I hold out to my students the Thinkquest project&#13;
  as a model for the collaborative and multicultural interaction that is possible through the use of the Internet."&#13;

The FHS licenses tools from WebCTof Canada, which allow a teacher with no programming skill to set up&#13;
and run an online course.WebCTis one of several commercial companies (along with Lotus, Socrates,&#13;
Cogito Learning Media, Inc., Blackboard Inc., and others) that market tools for creating and operating&#13;
Web-based course. Teachers and others interested can go to http://www.blackboard.com, set up an actual&#13;
course on the Blackboard server, and invite students to enroll and take the course--all free provided the&#13;
course requires no more than 5MB of server memory. Blackboard Inc. charges fees to host larger, 10MB&#13;
courses and to license its tools and/or its education portal of links to valuable content.&#13;

recently.Web-based courses for teachers, students, and school administrators are helping the state catch up&#13;
with the rest of the country.Amajor effort, funded in large part by special grants from the federal govern-&#13;
ment, has brought Internet access to most of the state's schools and is now providing teacher training&#13;
through a combination of regional hands-on centers and Web-based courses that use the state's customized&#13;
version of Blackboard. Some secondary school teachers are now offering courses they have developed&#13;
with Blackboard tools. For example, a math teacher at a Catholic high school teaches an online version of&#13;
her ninth-grade Algebra I course to eighth-graders who are ready for more advanced work. Children in the&#13;
nearby K-8 Catholic school who expect to go to her high school are given priority in admission, but any&#13;
other "seats" up to a maximum of 20 may be filled by any able eighth-grader in the state at no cost.&#13;

                                 BOX 5.4: THE VIRTUAL SECONDARY SCHOOL&#13;
&#13;
  The state of Florida now offers a virtual high school, FHS (Florida High School), based on a huge computer&#13;
  server in Orlando. For religious, medical or other cultural reasons, some students cannot attend their local public&#13;
  school and are taught at home by their parents. An increasing number of parents has been opting to teach their&#13;
  children at home because they have lost confidence in the public school system. FHS was founded in 1997&#13;
  to give home-schooled children an accredited secondary school curriculum. A student can now spend the&#13;
  entire four years of high school, grades 9-12, studying at home taking Web-based courses, which are free to&#13;
  Florida residents. Most of the enrollees, however, take fewer than half their courses online and still attend&#13;
  their regular school. They choose a Web-based course if their school does not offer the subject or if they are&#13;
  unable to take the class at the scheduled time. The FHS currently has 4,500 enrollments. (This figure counts&#13;
  many students more than once, as each enrollment is a student signing up for a course.)&#13;
&#13;
  If Florida residents don't fill a course to capacity, anyone else may enroll and pay a modest fee. Students&#13;
  in other countries are welcome, and several have enrolled. However, the courses are offered only in English&#13;
  so far. Since Spanish-speaking youngsters make up a large and growing portion of the state's student&#13;
  population, Spanish versions of the courses and/or supplementary support for Spanish speakers are&#13;
  already in the planning stages. Development of the FHS courses was heavily subsidized by the state,&#13;
  which paid a group of outstanding teachers to do nothing but course development for several years. Those&#13;
  teachers now serve as master instructors, guiding less experienced on-line instructors for classes in the&#13;
  same course. Several other states, including Illinois and Kentucky, are preparing to set up virtual schools&#13;
  with consulting advice from Florida.&#13;
&#13;
  The FHS is successfully scaling up from a pilot project to an effective educational solution for an area as&#13;
  large as many countries. Florida got off to an earlier start than other states because it has a more central-&#13;
  ized system, aggregating school purchasing at the state level, for example. This centralized model may&#13;
  appeal to a ministry of education in a developing country. A country just embarking in this form of distance&#13;
  education could save money by licensing courses and training from FHS or other institutions with permis-&#13;
  sion to customize materials to national standards and cultural sensitivities.&#13;

TheBuckInstitutehasfoundthat:&#13;
&#13;
        Project Based Learning . . . has a striking ability to encourage active inquiry. Students&#13;
        appear to engage eagerly in what's usually described as "higher cognitive thinking&#13;
        activities" such as relating concepts and using existing criteria to evaluate new ideas;&#13;
        they work cooperatively and diligently with their peers, proceed with little supervision&#13;
        for extended periods of time, and use a variety of tools and resources autonomously,&#13;
        spontaneously, and creatively.13&#13;

Schools seem to find it easier to accommodate learning about technology as an add-on than to change their&#13;
traditional methods of teaching. There are several reasons why upper secondary education has been more&#13;
resistanttointegrationoftechnologythanlowerlevels:&#13;
&#13;

and more than 90 percent of the teachers in theWorLD program expressed overall satisfaction with its&#13;
implementation:&#13;
&#13;
        The most highly rated impact of the Program was on students' ability to get better jobs&#13;
        upon graduation, and a large number of students indicated that they had acquired the&#13;
        range of skills needed for the information economy. . . . They also said that the Program&#13;
        improved their attitudes toward school and their school attendance. A large majority of&#13;
        teachers agreed that students improved their information, communication, collabora-&#13;
        tion, and technological skills and attitudes. . . .15&#13;

        to help teachers implement online, collaborative, project-based learning activities with&#13;

The IIE case study in China compared groups of teachers at two sites using the country's extensive system&#13;
of TV-based distance education, including one in a rural area where only about 15 percent of the teachers&#13;
had a TV and VCR at home. Although the teachers could watch the TV broadcasts or videotapes at&#13;
centers, attendance was poor because teachers did not have time to travel the considerable distance from&#13;
their homes and schools. Unlike the 3PN program, the teachers were required to pass a final exam to&#13;
receiveadiplomaforthecourse.Althoughtheinstructorshadwantedtomodelaflexibleandopenlearning&#13;

               BOX 6.1: SCHOOL CHOICE, SCHOOL AUTONOMY, AND CURRICULAR&#13;
                                     INNOVATION IN THE NETHERLANDS&#13;
&#13;
 Secondary school students in Netherlands have consistently performed well in international comparisons of&#13;
 school achievement. In contrast to countries with more centralized schools (Singapore, for example) whose&#13;
 students are also high performers, the Netherlands is characterized by parental choice as a main influence&#13;
 on the organization of the educational system. This characteristic is the result of the Netherlands' unique&#13;
 historical and political context. In Northern European countries and in the United Kingdom, local authorities&#13;
 traditionally have important power. The constitution of the Netherlands guarantees people's freedom to found&#13;
 schools on the basis of their ideological or religious convictions and to have those schools funded by the&#13;
 government. Thus, over 700 secondary schools in the country differ considerably from each other in their&#13;
 philosophical approach and their pedagogical practices. In the Netherlands, public schools and private&#13;
 schools run by different churches and other interested groups coexist. Schools have a considerable degree&#13;
 of freedom in what they teach and how. Private schools, managed by associations or foundations, can&#13;
 impose admissions criteria, but public schools, generally managed by municipal authorities, are open to all&#13;
 students.&#13;
&#13;
 Within the same school, students can choose from a range of different types of education. In response to&#13;
 the need to create a broadly educated population with flexibility and good analytical skills, active and&#13;
 independent learning is being shaped in "study houses" within schools. Emphasizing the broad development&#13;
 of students and respect for individual differences, study houses are organized so that students participate&#13;
 in regular classes, work independently, and work in teams. This configuration is proving to have a higher&#13;
 rate of return to learning and enhance the attractiveness of education to students, thus reducing dropout.&#13;
&#13;
 Autonomy for schools permits them to operate their own assessment systems in an approach that is&#13;
 similar to that in Scotland. In addition to school-based assessment controlled by teachers, students take&#13;
 external examinations that count for half of their final grade to obtain the certificate of upper general&#13;
 education. The Ministry of Education establishes central policies and quality standards, and the Education&#13;
 Inspectorate carries out supervision on behalf of the Ministry of Education of the manner in which schools&#13;
 manage their affairs.&#13;

First Trend: Providing Greater Autonomy to School Actors&#13;

Although the question of the State and parental roles in youth education emerges as a consequence of&#13;
changes in the size and role of the State, this is by no means a new problem for education policies. On the&#13;

                                   COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS&#13;
&#13;
  Public schools managed by community-based organizations use youth development principles to help&#13;
  young people ages 15-21 who have dropped out or have difficulty learning in large impersonal high schools.&#13;
  These schools set standards to challenge students rather than to penalize them. They have adapted school&#13;
  structure and curriculum to the idea that young people learn best in relationships with caring adults who&#13;
  have high expectations for them and through opportunities to contribute to their communities. Here are&#13;
  some examples of the principles in practice:&#13;
&#13;
  High Expectations&#13;
  Students at Shalom High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, must fulfill state requirements in traditional subject&#13;
  areas and demonstrate mastery of 300 competencies designed by students and teachers in communication,&#13;
  critical thinking and analysis, problem solving, environmental responsibility, and social interaction.&#13;
&#13;
  Challenging and Relevant Learning&#13;
  Students at El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice in Brooklyn, New York, integrate their work across&#13;
  academic areas and show mastery of knowledge through in-depth projects, portfolio presentations, and&#13;
  testing. Students also incorporate studies with social action on critical community issues such as the&#13;
  impact of garment and sugar industries and local environmental and health issues.&#13;
&#13;
  Personalized and Flexible Schools&#13;
  Students at South Brooklyn Community High School, also in New York, work closely with one of four advo-&#13;
  cate counselors to assess their academic progress, facilitate communication with teachers, resolve personal&#13;
  issues affecting their education, access necessary resources, and explore career and college opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
  Opportunities to Make a Contribution&#13;
  Students at YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter High School in Pennsylvania rehabilitate abandoned houses for&#13;
  sale to low-income families while fulfilling competencies for graduation.&#13;

school autonomy presupposes access to financial, human, and knowledge resources, which are needed to&#13;

&#13;
In practice, school autonomy takes diverse forms, from "independent schools" in Scotland (see Box 6.3)&#13;
and "charter schools"7 in the United States to public schools administered by a mixed board in Nicaragua&#13;

                          BOX 6.3: DECENTRALIZED EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND&#13;
&#13;
 The education system of Scotland is highly decentralized with schools and teachers exercising a great deal&#13;
 of authority over management, content of learning, and assessment. There is no national curriculum in&#13;
 Scotland, although national guidelines are drawn up by working groups called together by the Scottish&#13;
 Executive Education Department. Following these guidelines, it is up to the individual schools to determine&#13;
 the exact nature of their curriculum. There is emphasis on the teachers assessing and monitoring the&#13;
 progress of students. Although there are national examinations established to monitor progress in Scotland,&#13;
 teachers decide the appropriate time for individual students to sit for the tests. Students enter public&#13;
 examinations for the Scottish Certificate of Education at standard and higher grades, or they may choose&#13;
 to study for vocationally oriented qualifications. There are no "league tables" based on national testing in&#13;
 Scotland that rank schools according to students' scores on examinations.&#13;
&#13;
 The system in Scotland contrasts sharply in some aspects to that of England where there is more central-&#13;
 ized control of learning and a lesser degree of autonomy at the school level. The National Curriculum&#13;
 introduced in 1988 sets out what pupils should study, what they should be taught, and the standards that&#13;
 they should achieve. League tables play an important role in evaluating the system as the results of&#13;
 national examinations are published for each child, each school, and national averages for comparison&#13;
 purposes. The approach to the curriculum for English offers an interesting comparative insight into the two&#13;
 systems. National guidelines for English in Scotland have much in common with those in England, but&#13;
 there is a greater recognition of the value of the diversity of culture and language within the community in&#13;
 the Scottish approach.&#13;

&#13;
The theme of parent involvement in schools represents a line of research parallel to, but deeper and older&#13;
than that of, school autonomy, but is very appropriate to the recent propositions about new education&#13;
reforms. There are many ways parents can support the work of the school: collect additional funds, attend&#13;
schoolmeetings,participateinschoolgovernment,takepartinteaching,andcreateafavorablehome&#13;

&#13;
Research on Autonomy and School Effectiveness. More evaluation and research need to be conducted&#13;
to respond to the question of the effectiveness of autonomous schools. A recent review of literature on&#13;
school autonomy published over the decade 1983-1993 found that less than 10 percent of those documents&#13;
reported some type of assessment of results. Only 2.5 percent of those studies had a systematic approach&#13;
andlessthan1percentinvolvedresultmeasurements.15 Ofthedocumentsidentifiedbytheauthorsand&#13;
published between 1995 and 1998, less than 10 percent presented some type of results in terms of school&#13;

                                          ACHIEVEMENT IN COLOMBIA&#13;
&#13;
  School quality may have different meanings, but it usually includes learning results measured by tests and&#13;
  examinations. A long research tradition in developed countries has identified factors that contribute to the&#13;
  explanation of school achievement results such as family, school, and teacher factors.&#13;
&#13;
  A study conducted in Colombian secondary schools found intriguing and useful results. For example, there&#13;
  are great differences in student achievement between schools, more noticeable in private schools. School&#13;
  equipment and facilities have a positive result on school achievement, as well as schools with only one&#13;
  shift. It seems to be important for students to stay in one school; continuous mobility affects learning&#13;
  outcomes negatively. As a whole, school variables explain between 15 and 18 percent of student achieve-&#13;
  ment variance in private schools and between 12 and 16 percent of the variance in public schools. Family&#13;
  environment is also an important factor associated with school learning, particularly in the area of lan-&#13;
  guage. This fact confirms the ideas presented in Chapter Four regarding the need for families and schools&#13;
  to work together for improving the quality of learning.&#13;

                      BOX 6.5: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION&#13;
&#13;
  The main options available to governments seeking to finance increased access to and participation in&#13;
  secondary schooling are the following five:&#13;
&#13;
     l    Option 1. Increase the overall allocation of public funds to the education sector.&#13;
     l    Option 2. Shift resources from other education levels to secondary education.&#13;
     l    Option 3. Improve efficiency by reducing costs, finding more cost-effective delivery systems through&#13;
          technology or alternatives, and increasing productivity with more graduates. Reallocation of posts&#13;
          within the education system and reduction of administrative positions in the ministry and schools can&#13;
          also increase the amount of effective resources directly available for schools.&#13;
     l    Option 4. Access alternative and additional sources of funding. Options for non-government funding&#13;
          include cost recovery, community contribution, and private sector participation, among others.&#13;
     l    Option 5. Utilize external assistance. Donor support can provide critical investment and initial funding,&#13;
          but is not a reliable source for a sustainable system.&#13;
&#13;
  It is likely that some combination of all of these options will be required for most countries in order to&#13;
  substantially expand access to good quality secondary education.&#13;

                              IMPROVING EQUITY AND ACCESS IN BRAZIL&#13;
&#13;
  In 1997, the Brazilian Government undertook a major effort to improve inequities in per-student spending in&#13;
  ensino fundamental, which includes lower secondary education, by launching the Fund for Development of&#13;
  Fundamental Education and Valorization of Teachers (FUNDEF). The FUNDEF is an allocation scheme for&#13;
  public revenues, requiring that 25 percent of all tax revenues in any state be the minimum investment in&#13;
  education, with at least 60 percent of that total invested in the FUNDEF and the remaining going into upper&#13;
  secondary and tertiary education. If the total value falls short of a designated minimum per-child invest-&#13;
  ment (about US $300 in 1998), the Federal Government makes up the difference. FUNDEF resources are&#13;
  distributed equally to the states on a per-student basis.&#13;
&#13;
  FUNDEF assures that every child in Brazil's ensino fundamental will study in a school system spending at&#13;
  least a minimum amount per child annually. The immediate impact of the program has been substantial,&#13;
  including: (i) a 50 percent increase in average teacher salaries in the Northeast; (ii) a 6 percent increase in&#13;
  initial enrollments; and (iii) nearly 11 million students benefiting from increased educational expenditures&#13;
  within their systems. Incentives for the states to expand access to lower secondary are built into the&#13;
  FUNDEF, as each additional student retained in the system represents additional income.&#13;

               BOX 6.7: FACILITATING TRANSITION FROM PRIMARY TO SECONDARY&#13;
                                            EDUCATION IN INDONESIA&#13;
&#13;
  The Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Program was designed to facilitate the expansion of&#13;
  secondary education in five Indonesian provinces (Aceh, West Sumatra, Jambi, South Sumatra, and&#13;
  Lampung). The program has three objectives: expand access to junior secondary education in a cost-&#13;
  effective and equitable way, improve the quality of junior secondary education, and strengthen education&#13;
  management capacity at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
  Expanding access involves: 1) creation of a total of 53,520 student school places; 2) gradual expansion of&#13;
  alternative equivalency programs; 3) student and teacher accommodations for public schools in rural and&#13;
  remote areas; and 4) financing of scholarships for 32,600 talented poor students with priority given to girls.&#13;
  Improving quality requires: 1) strengthening of teachers' subject-matter knowledge and pedagogical skills; 2)&#13;
  enhancement of learning environment; and 3) provision of contract teachers for rural areas. Strengthening&#13;
  capacity will be achieved by: 1) training school principals and other administrators in managing schools and&#13;
  providing pedagogical support to teachers; and 2) developing managerial and data analysis capacity.&#13;
&#13;
  The scholarship component illustrates demand-side financing of education in which funds are provided&#13;
  directly to the students and their families rather than schools in order to encourage school participation.&#13;
  Low-income families bear financial burdens when their children attend junior secondary school relative to&#13;
  the total family expenditures (between 40 and 80 percent). To assist rural families who cannot afford to pay&#13;
  for education, the government has established a scholarship program for children of low socioeconomic&#13;
  background with satisfactory academic achievement. Students can attend public or private schools. Of the&#13;
  36,000 junior secondary schools in Indonesia, only 10,000 are public.&#13;

            Beyond basic education : secondary
            education in the developing world
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This document presents several arguments
            to support the statement postulated by Aristotle 25
            centuries ago : " Policy makers should direct their
            attention above all to the education of youth "-each
            chapter addresses a different argument : the argument of
            equity and access in chapter 1; work and economic
            development in chapter 3; and democracy and human
            development in chapter 4. Chapter 1 discusses the forces of
            change that are creating a new environment for secondary
            education; and chapter 2 infers the implications of such an
            environment for policy making. Part of this new environment
            is the omnipresence of information and communication
            technologies, discussed in chapter 5. The last chapter
            (chapter 6) deals with responsibility for and management of
            secondary education. The authors are hoping to contribute to
            the development of practical knowledge on the education of
            youth, a critical problem for all countries. The document,
            further discuss the issues and challenges facing developing
            countries as they strive to expand access to secondary
            education. In this context, secondary education no longer
            serves only to prepare students for higher education, but
            also increasingly must prepare youth to become productive
            citizens upon completing school-whether at the conclusion of
            lower or of upper secondary school.
