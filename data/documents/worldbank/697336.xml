I. BACKGROUND&#13;
1. 1.  In 1991, the Government of Tanzania initiated its financial sector reform program&#13;
with the support from an IDA credit for financial sector adjustment (FSAC). The aim of&#13;
the program was to create a financial system that operates on the basis of market-&#13;
oriented principles, is efficient in mobilizing and allocating resources, and effective in&#13;
fostering long-term economic growth. Conceptually, the program was intended to: (i)&#13;
support a stable, market-oriented macro-economic framework; (ii) strengthen the&#13;
financial infrastructure, including banking and associated legislation; (iii) create a&#13;
competitive environment and introduce private participation in the banking sector; and&#13;
(iv) strengthen the existing banks. It was recognized, however, that the reforms needed&#13;
to achieve these objectives could not be speedily implemented, given the precarious&#13;
situation of the financial institutions. The short to medium-term objective was, therefore,&#13;
to create an appropriate policy and regulatory environment conducive to private sector&#13;
entry of both domestic and foreign banks while increasing private sector participation in&#13;
existing financial institutions. Specifically, the program included passage of new banking&#13;
laws and prudential regulations, restructuring of the three Government-owned&#13;
commercial banks, legislation to promote private sector participation in the insurance&#13;
industry, and initial steps to promote the emergence of a capital market in Tanzania&#13;
through the enactment of the Capital Markets and Securities Act.&#13;
1.2.  The reform program proceeded much slower than planned. Despite a number of&#13;
advances, the portfolios of the government-owned banks - of which a large share&#13;
consisted of loans to parastatals - were in more serious shape than foreseen and the&#13;
reforms in the parastatal sector were slow to materialize.  In August 1993, the&#13;
Government released its Master Plan for Parastatal Privatization and Reform. The Plan&#13;
entails the privatization, closure and liquidation of parastatals and the restructuring of&#13;
remaining parastatals to enhance their financial and operating performance. Technical&#13;
assistance is financed by an IDA credit for Parastatal and Public Sector Reform (PPRP)&#13;
and the policy reforms will be supported by a proposed Structural Adjustment Credit&#13;
(SAC), which will also support the continuation of policy reforms in the financial sector.&#13;
1.3.   The proposed Financial Institutions Development Project would build upon FSAC&#13;
and would complement the proposed Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC). Specifically,&#13;
FIDP would finance the technical assistance required to assist with the implementation of&#13;
reforms in the financial sector supported by SAC. Total financing of about $13.4 million&#13;
equivalent, including $8.4 million in foreign exchange, would be required for the project.&#13;
The proposed IDA credit of $10.9 million equivalent would support the following&#13;
components: (a) the restructuring and privatization of the National Bank of Commerce&#13;
(NBC) and the People's Bank of Zanzibar (PBZ); (b) continued strengthening of the&#13;
Bank Supervision Directorate (BSD) at the Bank of Tanzania; (c) studies to upgrade the&#13;
payments system and a business plan for a private credit information bureau; and (d)&#13;
support for the development of the insurance industry and capital markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.4.  The proposed project is one of a series which aim to support the medium- to&#13;
long-term development of Tanzania's financial sector. The restructuring of Tanzania's&#13;
major financial institutions will lead, perforce, to a substantial reduction in basic financial&#13;
services in some of Tanzania's remotest areas. The next financial sector credit, which&#13;
would support a proposed Rural Finance project, would attempt to build upon the&#13;
achievements of this project and sustain the expansion of financial services into rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
II. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR&#13;
A.    Overview&#13;
2.1.   Since the Arusha Declaration of 1967, the Tanzanian financial sector was mainly&#13;
Government-owned and comprised of (i) The Bank of Tanzania (BOT), the Central&#13;
Bank, (ii) three commercial banks--the National Bank of Commerce (NBC), the&#13;
Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (CRDB) and the People's Bank of Zanzibar&#13;
(PBZ), (iii) two development banks--the Tanzania Investment Bank and the Tanzania&#13;
Development Finance Limited, (iv) an assortment of smaller special-purpose non-bank&#13;
financial institutions--the Tanzania Post Office Savings Bank, the Tanzania Housing&#13;
Bank, the National Insurance Corporation, the National Provident Fund, the Parastatal&#13;
Pension Fund and a hire purchase company; and (v) the Diamond Jubilee Investment&#13;
Trust. Tanzania also had roughly 400 savings and credit societies, mainly located in&#13;
urban areas and over 200 cooperatives involved in financial intermediation in rural areas.&#13;
There were no capital or money markets, other than Government bonds and Treasury&#13;
Bills issued primarily to the insurance company, pension funds and savings bank.&#13;
However, the informal financial markets were active in foreign exchange dealings, fund&#13;
transfers and debt financing.&#13;
2.2.  By 1988, the financial sector was in a state of crisis, due mainly to the pervasive&#13;
interference of the Government in the financial system. Credit was directed on the basis&#13;
of Government priorities without regard to creditworthiness, and banks were convenient&#13;
agents of fiscal policy. The lack of separation between fiscal and financial activities,&#13;
combined with an unfavorable economic environment and an inadequate regulatory&#13;
framework, led to a significant misallocation of credit to banking system clientele who&#13;
were bankrupt and mostly in arrears; an ineffective monetary policy and an unstable&#13;
macro-economic framework characterized by the unchecked growth in the money supply;&#13;
and a lack of competition. Weak bank supervision further contributed to the crisis in the&#13;
sector.&#13;
2.3.  In August 1988, a Commission of Enquiry into the Monetary and Banking system&#13;
was established by the Government. Its mission was to examine the sector and make&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
recommendations on how to improve its overall performance and support economic&#13;
growth. The Commission presented its recommendations to the President in July 1990.&#13;
These recommendations mainly focused on: (i) stimulating competition by encouraging&#13;
private banks and joint ventures; (ii) strengthening the existing financial institutions; (iii)&#13;
developing management accountability; and (iv) the recovery of non-performing loans.&#13;
2.4.  Building on the findings of the Banking Commission, the Government&#13;
implemented a series of measures in 1991. The Government issued a Policy Statement&#13;
on financial sector reform which acknowledged the perverse impact on the sector caused&#13;
by a lack of competition and Government interference. In an important reversal of&#13;
policy, the Banking and Financial Institutions Act was enacted. The Act permitted the&#13;
entry of private banks into the market and vested BOT with supervisory and regulatory&#13;
controls. Also, interest rates were liberalized and banks were allowed to set lending rates&#13;
below an announced maximum and to set deposit rates freely, subject to the twelve-&#13;
month deposit rate being positive in real terms. The Government also enacted the Loans&#13;
and Advances Realization Trust Act to create an expeditious machinery for the recovery&#13;
of overdue debts. Finally, banking supervision in BOT was expanded and strengthened.&#13;
2.5.  The reform  program, which was supported by FSAC, consisted of four&#13;
components. The first component aimed to support a stable macro-economic framework,&#13;
including the development of a money market and indirect methods of monetary policy&#13;
control, within which financial institutions would be able to operate autonomously. The&#13;
second component of the program supported the strengthening of the regulatory&#13;
environment including a revision and streamlining of banking and associated legislation,&#13;
the introduction of banking supervision and regulation functions at the Bank of Tanzania&#13;
and a review of the accounting and auditing framework. The third component supported&#13;
the creation of a competitive environment and the introduction of private participation in&#13;
the banking sector. The fourth component addressed institutional strengthening of the&#13;
existing banks, including financial, organizational and managerial restructuring,&#13;
recapitalization based upon both public and private participation; and the establishment of&#13;
a mechanism for removing some non-performing assets from the banking system and for&#13;
facilitating collection and liquidation where necessary.&#13;
2.6.  Measured against the expected achievements of each of these four components of&#13;
the reform  strategy, FSAC enjoyed only minimal success.  The program's major&#13;
accomplishment was to deregulate and liberalize the banking system. However, a&#13;
competitive banking industry is yet to emerge in Tanzania and a large reform agenda&#13;
remains in each of the four areas of the strategy.  The performance of FSAC's four&#13;
components are discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
B. Macro-economic Framework and Money Market Development&#13;
2.7.  Economic Performance. Macro-economic performance has deteriorated since&#13;
1992/93 (i.e FY93). A fiscal surplus (including grants) which amounted to 2.3% of GDP&#13;
in FY92 was reduced to a deficit of 8.1% in FY93 primarily due to a sharp decline in&#13;
indirect tax revenues. Partly as a result of an accommodating monetary policy, the&#13;
money supply increased by 40%, and inflation remained over 20% in FY93. In an effort&#13;
to improve the fiscal situation, the Government passed a supplementary finance bill in&#13;
January 1993 which increased tax rates and user charges, reduced tax exemptions,&#13;
strengthened tax enforcement, and aimed to reduce expenditures. BOT also took steps&#13;
to contain the growth of the money supply; these included the introduction of a treasury&#13;
bill auction as part of BOT's efforts to use indirect methods of monetary control. These&#13;
measures were augmented by the 1993/94 budget which called for substantial tax&#13;
increases, including increases in customs sales taxes, introduction of a real estate tax,&#13;
increases in various fees and user charges for Government services, inclusion of excise&#13;
taxes on imports in the base used to calculate sales taxes, and further strengthening of tax&#13;
administration. The budget also limited increases in recurrent expenditure.&#13;
2.8.  Despite the introduction of these measures, macro economic performance&#13;
declined further in FY94. Government borrowing from domestic sources amounted to&#13;
approximately 5% of GDP in the second quarter of the fiscal year, indicating a serious&#13;
loss of monetary control. This was largely due to very high levels of expenditure,&#13;
particularly wage increases granted to the defense and security establishment and a large&#13;
check float from the previous year. On the revenue side, collections of taxes on imports&#13;
equaled less than half of assessed values due, in part, to a new policy of granting tax&#13;
exemptions to a number of industries for their imported inputs. In addition, there were&#13;
substantial leakages through the financial system as NBC extended credit to agricultural&#13;
cooperatives.&#13;
2.9.  In January 1994, the Government reached agreement with the IMF on a Fund&#13;
staff monitored program. The program included the introduction of a comprehensive&#13;
package of fiscal measures including the effective rescinding of the customs duty&#13;
exemptions order and a review of tax exemptions with a view to decreasing their number.&#13;
The program also included measures to improve the performance of NBC, including the&#13;
reconstitution of the Board and steps toward the privatization of the bank (see below).&#13;
2.10. Money Market Development.  In July 1993, the Government removed the&#13;
remaining control on interest rates - the ceiling on lending rates of 31 percent per annum.&#13;
Commercial banks were allowed to set their own interest rates on loans, subject to the&#13;
rate being greater than the inflation rate. During that month, the Government also held&#13;
its first foreign exchange auction and, in August, the Government introduced regular&#13;
auctions of short-term treasury bills. The former was an important tool in unifying the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
official and parallel currency exchange rates, while the latter was to establish a reference&#13;
point for interest rates. Both auctions are important in soaking up excess liquidity and&#13;
putting downward pressure on inflation and inflationary expectations.  Since the&#13;
introduction of the foreign exchange auction, the exchange rate has moved within a&#13;
narrow band of between Tsh 515 to Tsh 544 to the dollar. On the other hand, T bill rates&#13;
have varied sharply moving from 28 percent in September 1993 to over 90 percent and&#13;
then to 47 percent at the end of 1994". However, the full impact of the T bill auction on&#13;
reducing excess liquidity was offset by NBC which continued to inject liquidity into the&#13;
economy by operating on minimal spreads and incurring operational losses.&#13;
2.11. One of the most important changes that the T-bill auction heralds is the&#13;
establishment of a market-driven benchmark for other interest rates. Also, the T-bill&#13;
auction can reduce liquidity in the system, and thereby reduce the historically high&#13;
inflation rates in Tanzania. However, there are potential risks. First, the government&#13;
may see the process as a new financing mechanism for future deficits. Second, the theory&#13;
of market-driven interest rates is based on competition in the marketplace so that no&#13;
single party can substantially influence the behavior of others. NBC dominates the&#13;
financial sector and its behavior affects T-bill pricing. Participation in the market is very&#13;
thin. Hence, improvements to the operations of the market will require: (i) stricter&#13;
control of the deficit, coupled with better coordination between the Treasury and BOT&#13;
on the former's cash flow requirements; (ii) a substantial reduction of NBC's dominance&#13;
in the financial sector; and (iii) the creation of a secondary market for T bills.&#13;
2.12. More fundamentally, the development of a money market will require significant&#13;
improvements to Tanzania's payments system. The system is based mainly on cash with&#13;
checks used primarily by government ministries. The creation of the Dar es Salaam&#13;
Clearing House in July 1993 was an important improvement to the payments system.&#13;
However, the system is still at a very early stage of development and there are still long&#13;
check clearing delays as a result of deficiencies in communications and transportation&#13;
infrastructure. The time for a collecting bank to credit cleared funds to payee accounts is&#13;
six working days in Dar es Salaam and up to 28 days for branches in the rest of Tanzania.&#13;
This is one reason the Tanzanian public is very reluctant to use checks as a system of&#13;
domestic payments. This is reflected in the unusually high ratio of currency in circulation&#13;
to money supply (.36). The slowness and inefficiencies of the clearing system also pose&#13;
serious problems for monetary policy management since large payment system floats&#13;
make liquidity levels very difficult to manage.&#13;
11 The Government introduced a tax on T bills in July 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
C.    Bank Supervision.&#13;
2.13. The Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1991 strengthened BOT's bank&#13;
supervision authority and, in November 1992, banking supervision was elevated to the&#13;
status of a Directorate and staffing levels were increased. The directorate has evolved&#13;
quite strongly as a result of a new series of banking laws and prudential regulations. It&#13;
has begun to develop most of the basic skills necessary to conduct banking examinations&#13;
and has conducted a series of on-site examinations. The initial design of examination&#13;
methodologies for both on and off-site supervision has been undertaken and the&#13;
development of regulations to support the legislative framework, including policy and&#13;
procedural guidelines for the licensing of new banks and other financial institutions, has&#13;
been issued.&#13;
2.14.  A significant portion of the necessary upgrading of staff technical skills is being&#13;
adequately addressed. The major weakness remains in the delays in implementing an&#13;
effective off-site monitoring system.  A number of standardized forms have been&#13;
developed. However, implementation and compliance by the financial institutions have&#13;
not been consistent. Also, a major constraint to effective bank supervision is the lack of&#13;
integrity overall of the financial data. Accounting standards are very weak and disclosure&#13;
poor; although a significant effort has been made to establish an off-site surveillance&#13;
system, the struggle to ensure integrity in the data has been onerous.  This difficulty is&#13;
amplified in attempts to determine bank solvency through loan portfolio reviews.&#13;
Consequently, a measure of the non-performing assets in the system is rudimentary, at&#13;
best. The analytical skills and acumen of examiners need to be above average when&#13;
dealing with such poor quality of information in order to glean from it some level of&#13;
reliable analysis.&#13;
2.15. The directorate has a set of enforcement regulations which allow for issuance of&#13;
"cease and desist" orders and/or monetary penalties to be imposed on the banks for non-&#13;
submission of periodic reports. They can also take punitive action in the case of non-&#13;
compliance of required liquidity or capital adequacy ratios. Hence, the BOT, upon the&#13;
recommendation of the Directorate of Bank Supervision, has imposed penalty interest&#13;
charges for failure to maintain the required levels of liquidity reserves. Until this year, the&#13;
payments were simply debited from the banks' accounts with BOT, and the penalties were&#13;
not sufficiently onerous to modify the behavior of the banks.&#13;
2.16. The Directorate is divided into three units (banks, non-bank institutions, and&#13;
foreign exchange bureaus), each of which has an on-site examination section and a central&#13;
financial analysis section which is mandated to undertake off-site surveillance activities.&#13;
Unfortunately, the current staffing of these sections is heavily skewed towards the&#13;
examination groups.  The financial analysis sections are understaffed, and off-site&#13;
supervision activities have suffered as a result. This understaffing only compounds the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
basic problem as the financial institutions themselves do not take the reporting&#13;
requirements seriously and have not complied with the basic financial reporting&#13;
regulations on a timely basis.&#13;
2.17. The efforts of Bank Supervision to date can best be described as limited in scope&#13;
but expanding on an ambitious scale. The Directorate's work has concentrated mainly on&#13;
examinations of the larger NBC branches and protracted exams of both CRDB and the&#13;
Tanzania Investment Bank in anticipation of the implementation of their scheduled&#13;
restructuring programs. The examination sections have conducted on-site examinations&#13;
at each of the five Government banks and have reported on the virtual insolvency of each&#13;
of these institutions. Their examinations have revealed that over 70% of all loans in these&#13;
banks are non-performing and that all are operating in an unsafe and unsound manner.&#13;
2.18. The severe problems within the financial institutions make the role of the&#13;
Directorate all the more critical and complex. Gross errors in basic loan approval&#13;
systems and accounting techniques continue despite many warnings by Bank Supervision.&#13;
The capital requirements necessary to rectify the situation as found in these examinations&#13;
and restore the financial system to solvency are massive. Over the next few months, the&#13;
Directorate will have to devote even more attention to the problem banks, even as new&#13;
banks enter the market. This will severely strain the Directorate's capacity, test the skills&#13;
of its staff, and curtail its ability to conduct new on-site examinations.&#13;
2.19.  The Directorate also must make greater use of its enforcement powers, including&#13;
the ability to impose monetary penalties and issue cease and desist orders as well as the&#13;
ability to remove bank management when it continues to ignore directives. The office&#13;
must increase its staffing levels with particular emphasis on off-site surveillance analysts&#13;
in order to strengthen its off-site monitoring capabilities.&#13;
2.20. The complex and difficult restructuring programs which will require substantial&#13;
oversight by Directorate personnel will severely test the technical abilities and staffing&#13;
levels of Bank Supervision. The Directorate needs to expand substantially if it is to&#13;
properly perform its functions as one of the architects of the future financial system, as&#13;
well as conduct the number of in-depth on-site examinations it must be able to undertake&#13;
annually. While the expansion of staff levels is clearly needed, the ability to effect this&#13;
growth while simultaneously training the new staff is critical. Placing inexperienced and&#13;
untrained bank examiners in the field too early can be counterproductive. The ongoing&#13;
series of staff training programs must be continued in order for Bank Supervision to&#13;
reach its potential as an effective regulatory unit. The programs also must be augmented&#13;
to expand its focus on the internal control environment and the corporate governance&#13;
processes required to mitigate risk. This is of particular importance as the financial&#13;
system expands and diversifies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.21.  These issues must be addressed and resolved if the Directorate is to carry out its&#13;
role to protect the interests of depositors, implement BOT policies and maintain the&#13;
safety and soundness of the financial system.&#13;
D.   Competition&#13;
2.22. The reform program encouraged the emergence of a competitive environment&#13;
through the introduction of private sector participation in the banking sector.&#13;
Participation was envisaged through the entry of new banks and the restructuring and&#13;
privatization of existing banks. Two new banks began operations in late 1993 and four&#13;
other banks have been licensed2. Understandably, the new banks have been very cautious&#13;
and have been limiting their activities in terms of deposit mobilization and lending. Their&#13;
behavior, to some extent, is dictated by the overall economic environment, but also to the&#13;
disappointingly slow pace of restructuring of the National Bank of Commerce.&#13;
E.    Bank Restructurinz&#13;
2.23. FSAC supported the strengthening of the existing banks, including restructuring&#13;
and recapitalization. Progress in this area was disappointing. Although the Government-&#13;
owned financial institutions were to be recapitalized with significant portions of their non-&#13;
performing assets transferred to the specially created Loans and Advances Recovery&#13;
Trust (LART), the banks are still insolvent and incurring substantial losses.&#13;
2.24. Loans and Advances Realization Trust (LART). LART was created in June 1991&#13;
and became fully operational in early 1993 following the appointments of the&#13;
Administrator, Board and Tribunal members in June 1992; and the signing of Memoranda&#13;
of Understanding (MOU) specifying the responsibilities and obligations of the banks and&#13;
the Government pertaining to the transfers of non-performing assets. Following the&#13;
completion of portfolio reviews and loans classification by BOT, approximately Tsh 36&#13;
billion of the non-performing assets of NBC, CRDB and TIB were transferred to LART&#13;
in 1993.  These assets represented 91 separate corporate customers, including 24&#13;
parastatals and incorporated 104 actual credit facilities. As of January 1995, eighty (80)&#13;
firms have been placed under receivership including 22 parastatals; 8 firms were sold,&#13;
including 2 parastatals, and of these 8, 4 firms have completed the dissolution process.&#13;
Loan recoveries by LART to year end 1994 amounted to Tsh 1.6 billion or 23% of the&#13;
total estimated recoveries of Tsh 7 billion. The legislation which created LART requires&#13;
that it be wound up by the end of 1995.&#13;
2.25. Restructuring the National Bank of Commerce. Given NBC's doininance in the&#13;
financial sector, the pace of its restructuring essentially determines the pace of financial&#13;
2/ One of the new banks was closed in March, 1995 and subsequently taken over by another foreign&#13;
private bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
sector reform in Tanzania. The largest and oldest commercial bank in Tanzania, NBC&#13;
has, for the past 28 years, enjoyed a virtual monopoly in terms of branch network,&#13;
savings mobilization and extension of credit and other commercial banking services.&#13;
Faced with rising costs, high levels of non-performing assets and declining efficiency, the&#13;
bank is undergoing financial and organizational restructuring, and at the same time&#13;
redefining its market niche as private commercial banks enter the market. In 1992, the&#13;
Government began implementation of a plan to restructure the bank. The plan called for&#13;
the gradual restructuring of the loan portfolio using guidelines for classifying risk assets&#13;
and provisioning, the downsizing of NBC's branch network and staffing, and a structural&#13;
reorganization aimed at separating business development functions from credit&#13;
management while placing new emphasis upon account and portfolio management.&#13;
2.26. NBC was recapitalized by the Government in a two-part transaction in November&#13;
1992 and in October 1993. The recapitalization required the issuance of Tsh5O billion in&#13;
treasury bonds at an annual expense to the Government of Tsh 8.6 billion.  The&#13;
transaction was relatively complicated: subsequent to a loan portfolio review as of&#13;
December 1991 that was completed in December 1992, some Tsh 28 billion loans were&#13;
turned over to LART for collection; Tsh47 billion of outstandings were effectively&#13;
charged-off but NBC continued to manage collections for the benefit of Government&#13;
under a fee arrangement; at least Tsh8.8 billion were guaranteed by the Government and,&#13;
thus, were retained as loans to Central Government; and some Tsh4.3 billion loans were&#13;
characterized as long-term loans.  In addition, as part of the overall restructuring&#13;
program, 23 loss making branches were closed and 2,000 staff were retrenched.&#13;
2.27. In the second half of 1993, there were a number of setbacks to the restructuring&#13;
program especially in terms of branch closings, staff retrenchment, and credit policies.&#13;
Also, with the introduction of the T bills auction system, NBC was slow to raise deposit&#13;
rates to face the competition from the auction, and was equally slow in adjusting its&#13;
lending rates in an increasingly illiquid environment. These factors, plus a substantial&#13;
increase in the minimum reserve requirements from 4 percent to 10 percent, placed the&#13;
bank in a precarious financial position by January 1994.&#13;
2.28. A short term action plan to curtail losses and to begin preparations for a more&#13;
radical restructuring of NBC was adopted in February 1994. A ceiling on outstanding&#13;
loans was imposed at the level of January 31, 1994. Data through March 1995 indicate&#13;
that NBC is complying with the ceiling, which will continue until a new and professional&#13;
management team in NBC has prepared and begun implementation of a new business&#13;
plan. NBC also was directed to cease lending to non-performing borrowers. The Board&#13;
of Directors was reconstituted at the end of March 1994, and they, with the senior&#13;
management, quickly undertook to institute a number of measures to redress the&#13;
situation, examples of which included: (a) suspension of new credit facilities and scaling&#13;
down of existing facilities by 20% to all but the most liquid and performing borrowers,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
(b) intensification of loan management and recovery efforts including foreclosure of&#13;
securities pledged on past due accounts, (c) credit training, and (d) instituting disciplinary&#13;
action against dishonest employees as well as retrenching 800 additional staff by April&#13;
1994. The NBC Act was amended in August 1994 to provide for private shareholding.&#13;
A detailed portfolio review was completed in September, 1994 as part of a diagnostic&#13;
evaluation of the bank. The evaluation will firm up the details of the Government's&#13;
privatization strategy for NBC.&#13;
2.29. NBC's loan portfolio grew by 10% per annum during the three year period from&#13;
June 1991 to June 1994. This represents a significant reduction in real terms. The&#13;
distribution of the most seriously classified loans (doubtful and loss) across sectors,&#13;
according to both NBC and a diagnostic evaluation, is not proportionate to loans&#13;
outstanding. The private portfolio grew from 41% of gross loans outstanding in June&#13;
1993 to 50% in June 1994, but constituted only approximately 30% of the doubtful and&#13;
loss loans. The proportion of NBC's portfolio that is cooperative and marketing boards&#13;
has decreased by 9% since June 1993, but it still represents around 34% of the losses.&#13;
The percentage of NBC's portfolio devoted to parastatals has declined by 5%, from 26%&#13;
to 21% and represents approximately 23% of the loss and doubtful loan portfolio.&#13;
Updated numbers to December 1994, show the portfolio continues to deteriorate with&#13;
only 9% of the portfolio unclassified as at that date.&#13;
2.30. The three portfolio reviews completed in 1994 indicate that the portfolio has&#13;
continued to deteriorate over the year. The last review in December 1994 confirmed that&#13;
non-performing loans i.e. classified sub-standard or worse had reached a level of 77% of&#13;
the total portfolio, as compared to previous estimates of 50% to 70%. The varying&#13;
estimates reflect previous major uncertainties about the bank's current financial condition&#13;
stemming in particular from the integrity of Tsh 58 billion of reported interest income,&#13;
and the appropriateness of characterizing Tsh 21 billion of liabilities as equity. Hence,&#13;
despite the implementation of the action plan in February 1994, it is now apparent that&#13;
the bank again is seriously insolvent and requires a very dramatic downsizing and&#13;
restructuring if it is to stem current losses and successfully reach self-sustainability (see&#13;
Annex 3 for a summary of NBC's unaudited balance sheet and income statement as of&#13;
June, 1994).&#13;
2.31. The gap between NBC's third posting of June, 1994 numbers as provided in&#13;
Annex 3 and financials reflecting the adjustments that have been recommended as a result&#13;
of the diagnostic review are vast. NBC's numbers showed a Tsh 20 billion profit for the&#13;
year, despite current year provision expenses of Tsh 38.6 billion. With the financial&#13;
adjustments made to the June 1993/1994 statements, NBC will record a loss of over Tsh&#13;
50 billion. The magnitude of the loss is due to a number of items. Operationally, NBC&#13;
has been accruing interest income on non-performing loans and Tsh 10 to 14 billion is to&#13;
be added to the losses, as accrued interest income is correctly reversed for loans which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
were past due 90 days or more. Even if only 50% of the loan portfolio had been non-&#13;
performing throughout the year, Tsh58 billion of interest income equates to a stunning&#13;
62% yield on the remaining accruing loans. Interest income increased by 60% or Tsh22&#13;
billion over FY93. While the yield on gross loans reached 33%, the cost of deposits&#13;
declined to 7%.&#13;
2.32. In addition to the questionable net interest margin, other sources of NBC's FY94&#13;
income seem unsustainable, at best. Exchange gains reached Tsh22.4 billion, a 167%&#13;
increase supposedly reflecting successful trading activities of NBC. Much of this gain has&#13;
had to be reversed as NBC's auditors have disallowed the income. Meanwhile, non-&#13;
interest expenses have increased by 40% from Tshl8.6 billion to Tsh26.1 billion. The&#13;
biggest increases were in retrenchment costs, depreciation, and maintenance. If exchange&#13;
equalization gains and revaluation of real estate are excluded from equity and all of the&#13;
currently most conservative estimates of provisions, reserves and interest income&#13;
reversals are used, then equity could fall to between a negative Tsh 55 and 75 billion.&#13;
2.33. The sizable adjustments to NBC's financial statements was caused by:&#13;
.considerable difficulties in clearing interbranch transactions including uncleared&#13;
checks, money transfers and other risk assets (for example, mishandled funds).&#13;
The extent of the problem was reflected in the large and unreconciled balances&#13;
in the Head Office Suspense and Interbranch Clearing accounts. These are the&#13;
result of NBC's cumbersome interbranch clearing system and the absence of&#13;
proper internal controls to prevent loss or funds manipulation. As a result of a&#13;
major effort by NBC to clean up this problem, the previous 80 troublesome&#13;
branches have been reduced to 8 to 10, with the unreconciled balances reduced&#13;
to a small fraction (10%) of their former level, however, still recording a large&#13;
unreconciled position requiring a reserve of Tsh 17 billion.&#13;
. previous substantial unreconciled balances in the House account. This account&#13;
is the repository of other transactions which have not been settled, i.e&#13;
suspended items other than normal checks and money transfers. Examples of&#13;
such items include forged checks. Although the Board set a date of September&#13;
30, 1994 to clear all long-standing items in this account, this was not achieved&#13;
and the diagnostic review identified a required reserve of Tsh 12 billion.&#13;
. the lack of internal controls and inadequate reconciliation and audit procedures&#13;
over a number of other internal accounts.  Consequently, a number of&#13;
additional adjustments relating to nostro balances, bills negotiated, contingent&#13;
liabilities, among others were required. The discrepancy for these accounts&#13;
alone amounted to over Tsh 25 billion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
. NBC's staff lack of experience with, and understanding of, the loan&#13;
classification process. The Credit Department charged with responsibility for&#13;
credit analysis and loan review has been unable to reconcile the quarterly&#13;
provision reports, which enumerate and classify the branch's loans, with either&#13;
the loan balances reported on the general ledger or the balances removed&#13;
and/or guaranteed by the Government as part of the recapitalizations;&#13;
. the accounting associated with the transfer of loans to LART and the&#13;
recapitalizations in FY1993 and FY1994 has neither been timely nor well&#13;
understood. As a result, NBC's management has not been able to track trends&#13;
in the quality of its loan portfolio given their inability to segregate non-&#13;
performing loans from those of subsequent periods. As well, the 11% coupon&#13;
to service the bonds which replaced the assets moved to LART, has never been&#13;
paid by the Government, severely hampering NBC's ability to operate on a&#13;
commercial basis.&#13;
2.34. NBC's management and staff are making substantial efforts to deal with its&#13;
significant non-performing loan portfolio, as well as institute proper control procedures&#13;
across the bank. Measurement of loan collection results has been introduced bankwide.&#13;
Staff are fully aware of the new priority and their success in collection is being strictly&#13;
monitored and will impact the personnel appraisal system. A new loan recovery unit has&#13;
been established to deal with the largest and toughest credits. A detailed loan recovery&#13;
plan for the largest 50 credits has been finalized and is under implementation and this&#13;
coupled with evidence of tangible collection results is a precondition for appraisal of the&#13;
proposed SAC. However, despite these diligent efforts to restructure and strengthen its&#13;
operations, the bank again appears to be on the brink of insolvency and is imposing an&#13;
increasing burden on Tanzania's real sectors. It is urgent and essential that NBC is far&#13;
more fundamentally restructured than what has been envisaged to date.&#13;
2.35. Restructuring the Cooperative and Rural Development Bank. After a delay due&#13;
to problems in securing funding for technical assistance, a detailed restructuring plan for&#13;
CRDB was finalized. The problems stemmed from donor requests in 1992 for a change&#13;
in CRDB's senior management and for the appointment of a private external auditor.&#13;
From July 1992 through June 1993 CRDB's net worth deficit deteriorated substantially.&#13;
Company prepared financial statements for 1993 contained gross accounting errors&#13;
which overstated collected interest income which had actually been capitalized, under&#13;
provided for non-performing assets, and erroneously recorded the bond received.&#13;
Hence, it is difficult to provide the exact extent of the deterioration in the bank's net&#13;
worth. However, estimates range from a deficit of Tsh. 27.3 billion to a deficit of Tsh 35&#13;
billion as of June 30, 1993, particularly if the in-house suspense items are reconciled and&#13;
the loss position is recognized. In either case, this is a significant increase over the Tsh&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
21.5 billion deficit reported in the June 30, 1992 audited financial statements and&#13;
illustrated the continuing deterioration of the institution.&#13;
2.36. There has been an improvement in performance as the management moved&#13;
aggressively to implement the restructuring plan. The plan calls for the privatization of&#13;
CRDB through the sale of shares to cooperatives and private individuals, with up to 30&#13;
per cent of the shares retained by a Trust, capitalized by DANIDA, pending their sale to&#13;
the public. A new organizational structure for headquarters, zonal and branch offices&#13;
was prepared and, as a result, a total of 600 staff members were retrenched. However,&#13;
CRDB's losses continued to grow and the bank's viability remained questionable.&#13;
Furthermore, in recapitalizing CRDB, some donor financed lines of credits were&#13;
erroneously omitted from the bank's balance sheet. The result was that CRDB remained&#13;
undercapitalized even after the last capital injection by the Government in October 1993.&#13;
2.37. The BOT has imposed a freeze on lending until completion of the recapitalization&#13;
program. To date, CRDB has made some progress:&#13;
C Capital. CRDB completed its privatization program in January. Sale of&#13;
shares to the public has been much stronger than anticipated with 9,962&#13;
individuals holding 41% of the approx. 200,000 offered. Danida's shares&#13;
represent 29%, cooperatives 16%, and corporations 14%. Notwithstanding&#13;
this success, the capital adequacy of the bank remains in question until the&#13;
external audit of its books is completed and the level of recovery, provisioning&#13;
and write-off of impaired assets is finalized and the statements are approved by&#13;
BOT.&#13;
* Management.  Senior management are very committed, although their&#13;
experience in restructuring a troubled commercial bank is very thin.&#13;
Retrenchment to date has been sizeable with total staff decreasing from 1,600&#13;
to 1,000 to date. Further staff reductions may be undertaken. The impact of&#13;
the retrenchment has allowed CRDB to reduce its operating expense from over&#13;
60 per cent to 54 per cent of financial income by June 1994. The targeted level&#13;
is 33 per cent. The annual statements, once finalized, will indicate annual&#13;
performance against target.&#13;
* Earnings. Due to accounting problems, it is difficult to determine if CRDB is&#13;
profitable. By CRDB's rough calculation, it has had loan recoveries of Tsh&#13;
10.5 billion, although the booking of these recoveries has been credited, in&#13;
error, to the wrong general ledger accounts. Consequently, both income and&#13;
asset accounts need to be reconstructed to enable CRDB to audit its books and&#13;
issue its financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Liquidity.  Despite a strong deposit mobilization effort, CRDB's liquidity&#13;
position was very weak during 1994 causing, at times, their expulsion from the&#13;
clearing house and fines by the BOT for non-compliance with the cash reserve&#13;
ratio. Its large non-performing portfolio has been the main reason for its tight&#13;
liquidity. The BOT has worked with CRDB to manage its liquidity position and&#13;
the Bank Supervision Directorate monitors the position weekly. By the third&#13;
and fourth quarters, loan recoveries coupled with some deposit mobilization&#13;
enabled CRDB to comply with the liquidity regulations. Strong management&#13;
of this position, however, continues to be required.&#13;
2.38. Despite the bank's reported successes in loan recovery and equity mobilization,&#13;
the overall financial position remains in question until the significant accounting problems&#13;
are resolved and the audit finalized. Only following resolution of these issues and&#13;
demonstrated compliance with all prudential guidelines, will the BOT allow a change in&#13;
licensing status. Until then, a freeze on further lending will remain in place.&#13;
2.39. Restructuring of Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB). Prior to FSAC, TIB mainly&#13;
lent to industrial parastatals and over 90 per cent of its portfolio was in arrears of one&#13;
year or more. The bank also was illiquid. An advisory team was appointed in October&#13;
1992 and a restructuring plan was finalized and agreed with IDA. Major elements of the&#13;
plan included a redefinition of TIB's role and its transformation into a merchant bank;&#13;
and its privatization through sale of a majority of its shares to a foreign partner. TIB has&#13;
ceased all lending, pending its transformation and privatization.&#13;
2.40. Restructuring of Other Banks. A restructuring plan for TDFL was finalized in&#13;
1992 and the institution was recapitalized by its shareholders. A restructuring plan for&#13;
the Tanzania Housing Bank was finalized in April 1994. The People's Bank of Zanzibar&#13;
remained undercapitalized for most of the program  period.  Although PBZ's non-&#13;
performing assets were transferred to LART in November 1993 and the bank was&#13;
recapitalized, a restructuring plan was not finalized. Preparation of the restructuring plan&#13;
did not begin until February 1994 and the plan is yet to be finalized although a draft is&#13;
now available.&#13;
F.    IDA's Previous Role and Lessons Learned&#13;
2.41. IDA supported the Government's policy reforms in the financial sector through&#13;
FSAC. The program legally deregulated and liberalized the banking system. However, it&#13;
failed to accomplish the intended restructuring of NBC, and consequently, although&#13;
private banks have opened, the major problem in the sector remains the absence of&#13;
meaningful competition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
2.42. There are three major reasons why FSAC failed to accomplish the significant&#13;
restructuring of the banking system which was envisaged. These factors would all be&#13;
addressed by the proposed Financial Institutions Development Project.  First, the&#13;
program assumed that the emergence of competitive private banks would gradually erode&#13;
NBC's market share. Although there has been some loss of market share, future&#13;
expansion by the private banks will be constrained by their limited Dar es Salaam branch&#13;
networks and, more importantly, their strategic targeting of relatively narrow niches. As&#13;
a result, NBC remains dominant and will continue to dominate. A more aggressive&#13;
strategy, which is supported by the proposed project, is required to reduce NBC's market&#13;
share. Second, FSAC financed advisers to NBC's management. However there was no&#13;
incentive for NBC's management to change and no incentive for the experts to perform.&#13;
Until recently, there had been no discernible change in NBC's banking culture. The&#13;
proposed project would finance a management team for NBC who would be evaluated, in&#13;
part, on the basis of NBC's financial performance.  Third, FSAC did not include&#13;
timebound performance targets against which NBC's performance could be judged. The&#13;
proposed project includes dated monitorable targets.&#13;
G.   Rationale for IDA's Involvement&#13;
2.43. Country Strategy. The Bank's lending strategy is to assist the Government to&#13;
reduce poverty through an acceleration in the pace of structural reform and the provision&#13;
of infrastructure and social services (especially targeted to the poor), while ensuring an&#13;
environmentally sustainable development path. The strategy articulates specific criteria&#13;
for determining Tanzania's eligibility for substantial IDA support, including adjustment&#13;
loans. The criteria include improvements in the operation of public sector banks,&#13;
including stemming losses, increases in the quality of their portfolios, the introduction of&#13;
private management, and eventual divestiture.  The proposed Financial Institutions&#13;
Development project seeks to strengthen the banking sector and, more broadly, improve&#13;
the access of the private sector to the banking system in general and to capital markets.&#13;
IDA also is assisting the Government with the formulation of a strategy for the&#13;
development of rural banking.&#13;
2.44. The development of a market-oriented financial system is a complex process&#13;
which will require sustained efforts over many years and will need to be supported by a&#13;
series of IDA operations. The Government's reform program, which was supported by&#13;
FSAC, enjoyed some success in creating a regulatory environment conducive to the entry&#13;
of both domestic and foreign private banks.  The proposed Financial Institutions&#13;
Development Project would address the major remaining impediments by: (a) increasing&#13;
efficiency and competition in the sector; (b) strengthening the financial infrastructure; and&#13;
(c) putting in place an appropriate regulatory environment for the orderly evolution of a&#13;
capital market. The project would complement the proposed Structural Adjustment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Credit which supports the Government's parastatal reform program as well as policy&#13;
reforms in the financial sector.&#13;
lIl. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Project Objectives&#13;
3.1.  Obiectives.  The progress of the Financial Sector Adjustment program  was&#13;
reviewed above. The review revealed that the sector is still very weak and that the&#13;
reform agenda is far from complete. Furthermore, in 1993 there was a reversal in some&#13;
major elements of the program. Although the Government has implemented a short term&#13;
program to stem the losses in the sector, it wishes to regain the momentum for financial&#13;
sector reform by implementing a strategy which would address the fundamental&#13;
weaknesses in the sector while building the foundation for the diversification of financial&#13;
instruments. The main elements of the strategy are (by order of priority): (i) encouraging&#13;
competition in the commercial banking sector; (ii) strengthening banking regulation and&#13;
supervision; (iii) improving the payments mechanism especially in rural areas; iv)&#13;
promoting and supporting comprehensive parastatal reforms, including privatization, of&#13;
state owned enterprises; (v) developing a market for Government securities; (vi)&#13;
establishing a regulatory structure for securities and insurance markets; and (vii)&#13;
developing a corporate securities market. In this context, the primary objectives of the&#13;
project, which are articulated in the Government's Letter of Financial Policy (see Annex&#13;
1), are to develop a market-oriented financial system and to ensure the orderly and&#13;
gradual evolution of capital markets in Tanzania while supporting the privatization&#13;
process.&#13;
B.    Summary Project Descrivtion&#13;
3.2.  The scope of the project, which would be supported by a $10.9 million credit, is&#13;
described in detail below.  The proposed project would include the following&#13;
components: (i) restructuring and privatization of NBC and PBZ within an agreed&#13;
timetable; (ii) strengthening of BOT's Bank Supervision Directorate; (iii) developing a&#13;
mechanism for regulating the insurance industry; (iv) studies on possible improvements&#13;
to the payments system and the feasibility of a private credit information bureau; and (v)&#13;
technical assistance to develop an appropriate mechanism for regulating and overseeing&#13;
the evolution of a capital market, as well as appropriate vehicles for facilitating broad&#13;
based participation in the privatization program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
3.3.   The project would consist of three components:&#13;
(1)  The Banks Restructuring  Component would  support a strategy  for&#13;
aggressively downsizing NBC and restructuring PBZ. Support would be&#13;

C.    Detailed Proiect Description&#13;
Banks Restructuring ($5.6 million)&#13;
3.4   NBC  ($3.6 million).   The project would support implementation  of a&#13;
restructuring and privatization strategy for NBC.  In normal circumstances, the&#13;
appropriate prudential response to NBC's current financial position would be to stop it&#13;
from lending or taking new deposits, pending rapid action to recapitalize the bank or&#13;
liquidate it. Given the dominance of NBC in the financial sector, and the consequent&#13;
macro-economic effects of its demise, liquidation is not practical at this time. The&#13;
strategy therefore is to constrain NBC's activities as much as possible, to avoid macro-&#13;
economic instability while allowing the bank to meet the legitimate needs of the&#13;
productive sectors. NBC would be downsized, until such time as it can meet prudential&#13;
requirements and be fully privatized (or liquidated, if it is unable to compete).&#13;
Meanwhile new banks are encouraged to enter the market.&#13;
3.5.  Details of the strategy will be defined by an ongoing diagnostic evaluation of&#13;
NBC. However, the strategy's broad elements entail: (a) carving out from NBC one or&#13;
two profitable urban branch networks (each network consisting of 8 to 10 branches) for&#13;
divestiture while retaining within a partially privatized NBC a national presence in urban&#13;
areas and a strong rural branch network; (b) the possible creation of a joint venture&#13;
subsidiary of NBC (in partnership with a strong private bank with an international&#13;
network) to focus on corporate and international transactions; (c) the restructuring of the&#13;
retained NBC under new and professional management.&#13;
3.6.  A schedule of activities which constitutes the broad elements of the strategy is&#13;
attached as Annex 2. First, the diagnostic evaluation, including an updated portfolio&#13;
review, would define the strategy for restructuring NBC including recommendations for&#13;
divestiture and the disposition of the impaired assets. The Government also has recruited&#13;
three senior, experienced commercial bankers as Deputy Managing Director\Chief&#13;
Operating Officer, Director of Finance and Credit Manager in NBC. Second, a review of&#13;
the features of the strategy would occur during the diagnostic evaluation so that the&#13;
remainder of the diagnostic evaluation could concentrate on: (a) analyses of the&#13;
implementation implications for NBC; (b) rapidly outlining a strategy that will maximize&#13;
the value of the branch network(s) sale and maximize the benefit of NBC's downsizing&#13;
on the financial sector overall; and (c) getting the joint venture underway. Third, the pro&#13;
formas for the entities and/or facilities to be offered for sale would be finalized and&#13;
agreed by the Government and NBC. This would likely include the removal of some&#13;
portion of the non-performing loans to a recovery unit that would be moved to a&#13;
subsidiary for collection. The residual NBC, after charging off the loans, would be a&#13;
smaller organization and would add some urgency to the tasks of reducing head office&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
administrative costs and rationalizing the rural branch network. Fourth. terms and&#13;
conditions for the sale of urban branch network(s) and the joint venture&#13;
international/corporate subsidiary would be prepared. Sales memoranda, authority to&#13;
disclose terms and contact particular buyers would be agreed. The schedule calls for the&#13;
opening of the urban network(s) under new ownership and for the joint venture to begin&#13;
operations by October, 1995. Conditions of the credit's effectiveness include the&#13;
completion of the diagnostic evaluation with a time-bound business plan,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, for the implementation of the downsizing and restructuring of&#13;
NBC and the appointment of a consulting firm or an investment bank to&#13;
implement the divestiture strategy.&#13;
3.7.  Implementation of the strategy required a clearer understanding of NBC's current&#13;
financial position.  The uncertainties surrounding NBC's financial situation were&#13;
described in Section II and reflect three major problems: (a) inappropriate accrual of&#13;
interest income on non-performing loans; (b) substantially higher provision requirements&#13;
for loans, other assets, and contingent liabilities; and (c) mischaracterization of certain&#13;
asset and liability accounts. Adjustments required by external auditors were made to&#13;
NBC's FY 1993/94 accounts prior to their finalization. The adjustments included&#13;
the write-off of all loans classified as loss. During negotiations, IDA received&#13;
assurances that, beginning with 1994\95, NBC will submit to IDA, annual audited&#13;
accounts within six months of the end of NBC's financial year and appropriate&#13;
adjustments will be made and all loans classified as loss will be written-off prior to&#13;
the finalization of the accounts.&#13;
3.8.  The project will finance a senior management tean in NBC for three years. The&#13;
team, which consists of a Chief Operating Officer, a Director of Finance, and a Credit&#13;
Manager, will prepare a business plan acceptable to IDA. The plan will: (i) provide for&#13;
continued credit restraint as NBC is restructured; (ii) address the significant portfolio of&#13;
non-performing assets; and (iii) aim to restructure the remaining bank into a self&#13;
sustaining and viable going concern. The plan will include time-bound performance&#13;
targets e.g. reductions in the ratio of operating costs to average total assets, increases on&#13;
the return on average total assets, reductions in the percentage of non-performing loans&#13;
in the portfolio, establishment of an appropriate loan to deposit ratio, increases on the&#13;
ratio of loan collections to scheduled collections and the adequate diversification of&#13;
credit risk. These ratios will be defined to ensure that aggregate lending could only&#13;
increase if there is a substantial strengthening of profitability and the quality of the asset&#13;
portfolio. The plan also will serve as a yardstick for prudential supervision until such&#13;
time as NBC meets prudential requirements. The management team has been&#13;
appointed with terms of reference acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.9.  During negotiations, IDA obtained the Government's assurance that the&#13;
NBC interim business plan, including a recovery plan for the non-performing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
loans, would be sent to IDA for approval and that NBC would be required to&#13;
adhere to the plan's performance targets. Also, assurances were obtained on the&#13;
continuation of the ceiling on NBC's overall lending as well as on lending to&#13;
parastatals until the business plan is prepared and under implementation. In&#13;
order to monitor lending to non-performing borrowers, IDA also received the&#13;
Government's assurance that NBC will submit monthly reports to BOT on&#13;
outstanding loans to large borrowers. The finalized business plan would be&#13;
furnished to IDA no later than October 31, 1995.&#13;
3.10. PBZ ($1.4 million). PBZ is the principal commercial banking institution in&#13;
Zanzibar. The recent examination of PBZ in December 1994 revealed that the bank was&#13;
insolvent and that roughly 70 per cent of its portfolio were rated substandard, doubtful or&#13;
loss. The main reasons for its poor financial status include a very weak loan portfolio&#13;
resulting from poor credit policies, a failure to previously recognize non-performing&#13;
assets (including continued interest accrual on such assets), and previous failure to&#13;
establish sufficient provisions for uncollectible loans.&#13;
3.11. Part of the difficulty experienced by the PBZ is that prior to December 1993 the&#13;
bank performed functions on behalf of the Government of Zanzibar which were not&#13;
traditionally associated with commercial banking. These included the maintenance of&#13;
substantial foreign exchange reserves on behalf of its parastatal clients who eam foreign&#13;
exchange for their exports.  Presumably, this arrangement was meant to ensure the&#13;
availability of foreign exchange when needed to cover imports. However, this hoarding&#13;
of foreign exchange resulted in unnecessary interest being paid on foreign borrowings and&#13;
a funding cost to PBZ, which had to borrow from the BOT to compensate for the non-&#13;
receipt of the T shillings counterpart. Additionally, the bank had subsidized the import of&#13;
basic food items by financing imports for sale in the local market below cost; this would&#13;
normally have been a treasury function.&#13;
3.12. The Government of Tanzania recognizes that the development of the financial&#13;
system in Zanzibar will depend critically on the restructuring of PBZ. The objective is to&#13;
convert the bank into a viable commercial bank and to transfer all non-commercial&#13;
banking activities to BOT and the Ministry of Finance in Zanzibar. Furthermore, all&#13;
services rendered to the Government would be fully paid for and priced at market rates.&#13;
The immediate aim would be to restructure PBZ and place it under private management.&#13;
The credit would finance the remuneration of two experts as General Manager and&#13;
Financial Controller for two years. Their main responsibilities will be to oversee the&#13;
restructuring of the bank. Specifically, this will include the preparation of a business&#13;
plan, the formulation of appropriate policies and operating procedures, installation of&#13;
effective internal control, the design of a marketing strategy, and the introduction of new&#13;
financial services.  During negotiations, IDA received the commitment of the&#13;
Government that: (a) a General Manager and Financial Controller, acceptable to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
the Borrower and IDA, would be appointed to manage PBZ by October 31, 1995;&#13;
and (b) a restructuring plan would be adopted for PBZ. In addition, beginning&#13;
with 1994/1995, PBZ will submit to IDA, annual audited accounts within six&#13;
months of the end of its financial year and appropriate adjustments will be made&#13;
and all loans classified as loss will be written-off prior to the finalization of the&#13;
accounts.&#13;
3.13. Ministry of Finance. ($0.6 million) The credit would also finance the services&#13;
of up to two advisers to the Ministries of Finance on the mainland and in Zanzibar and to&#13;
the Boards of NBC, THB, TIB and PBZ within the respective ministries. The&#13;
appointment of Banking Advisors under terms of reference acceptable to IDA is a&#13;
condition of effectiveness.&#13;
Financial Infrastructure Strengthening ($4.9 million)&#13;
3.14. Bank Supervision ($2.7 million). A Bank Supervision Advisor has been&#13;
provided to BOT as part of the IM's program of technical assistance. This component&#13;
would complement the IM's technical assistance by providing focused technical&#13;
assistance to the Bank Supervision Directorate for the supervision of problem&#13;
institutions, on site examinations, methodology development, and training.&#13;
3.15. Problem Institution Supervision (US$ 0.9 million). A major role of Banking&#13;
Supervision will be to closely monitor the restructuring or liquidation of the state-owned&#13;
financial institutions. This regulatory role is a critical one to ensure these institutions are&#13;
returned to viability or liquidated in a manner which would not be disruptive to the&#13;
financial system.  While the regulator should not interfere with the commercial&#13;
transaction relating to a sale or purchase of a problem institution, its approval of the&#13;
transaction is a prerequisite to its conclusion. Also, Banking Supervision's credibility will&#13;
be greatly enhanced if it is widely viewed as integral to the resolution of problem&#13;
institutions. Hence, the project would finance consultancies to: (1) monitor the&#13;
restructuring of the five state-owned banks; (2) advise on the progress of the respective&#13;
restructuring plans; (3) assist with problem institution supervision of NBFIs and foreign&#13;
exchange bureaus; and (4) direct the design and delivery of the Problem Institution&#13;
Management (PIM) training course for all the examination staff of Banking Supervision.&#13;
3.16. On-Site Examination (US$ 0.4 million). Specialist support is required for roughly&#13;
up to one year to bring the skills of the Bank SLLpervision Directorate up to an adequate&#13;
level in all high risk areas. The main focus will be on the development of the on-site&#13;
methodology pertaining to the internal control environment. Emphasis will be placed on&#13;
the role of the Board, as well as the treasury and systems areas, including wire payments&#13;
and money laundering. The consultant(s) wouldi report directly to the Director, Banking&#13;
Supervision but will be supervised by the IMF Advisor. However, when on-site, this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
specialist would work in a line examination role and report to the Manager, Examination&#13;
or the Examiner-in-Charge.&#13;
3.17. This expert(s) would work with the examiners to support them in risk&#13;
identification and risk mitigation. In addition, the specialist would be required to assess&#13;
risk management systems in each financial institution and provide feedback to these&#13;
institutions on their ranking relative to their peers. One output of such an exercise would&#13;
be the development of a best practices/minimum standards paper on key risk areas which&#13;
would be provided to existing institutions and to new financial institutions as a&#13;
requirement of the licensing process. In addition, this consultant(s) would be called upon&#13;
to: (1) develop the treasury and systems examination modules under the direction and&#13;
guidance of the IMF Advisor; (2) assist with the design and delivery of internal control&#13;
training programs in the high risk areas including but not limited to treasury and systems;&#13;
and (3) revisit the existing guidelines and regulations in the key risk areas, especially&#13;
relating to liquidity, interest rate risk, open market operations, as well as off-balance&#13;
sheet and off-shore operations.&#13;
3.18. Methodology ($0.8 million). The IMF Advisor is to provide technical assistance&#13;
for the development and completion of the methodology efforts of the Banking&#13;
Supervision Directorate. There are three key areas where methodology needs to be&#13;
designed, articulated and documented for use in the field. These include:&#13;
o     Off-site examination - A rudimentary system of off-site surveillance has been&#13;
developed and is in operation.  However, the reporting requirements are&#13;
incomplete, onerous and not well integrated with other information requirements&#13;
of the BOT. The banks have responded either by not reporting or by reporting&#13;
too late to have the information serve any useful purpose. Also, the information&#13;
reported is of questionable accuracy. As well the existing system does not include&#13;
early warning triggers to warn of the development of negative trends in the&#13;
industry such that corrective regulatory action can be taken.&#13;
In order to resolve the problem, the project would finance both short and long&#13;
term consultancies required for the implementation of the following three stage&#13;
program.&#13;
First, Banking Supervision with the assistance of legal and technical expertise&#13;
under the direction and coordination-ordination of the IMF Advisor, needs to&#13;
review the current laws, regulations and guidelines in order to ensure all major&#13;
areas of risk are well addressed by the regulatory framework.&#13;
Second, once this review has been completed, the regulatory reporting&#13;
requirements can be amended, updated and refined, as necessary. Also, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
National Board of Accountants and Auditors (NBAA), will be commissioned to&#13;
upgrade the accounting and disclosure requirements for financial institutions. It is&#13;
well recognized by BOT that consultation with the industry during this process&#13;
will be critical to improving the level, quality and timeliness of the revised&#13;
regulatory reporting. The IMF Advisor will be responsible for coordinating the&#13;
NBAA project, the results of the regulatory review exercise and the results of the&#13;
interface between Banking Supervision, the industry and NBAA.  Banking&#13;
Supervision will devote the part-time assistance of at least one member from each&#13;
of its Financial Analysis and On-site Examination teams to promote the&#13;
consultative role with the industry and to ensure the IMF Advisor, specialists, and&#13;
the NBAA project team have adequate practical feedback from the actual users of&#13;
the data.&#13;
Third, following the regulatory reporting refinement exercise,   Banking&#13;
Supervision needs to develop a data base to store the data from the regulatory&#13;
filings, to display and compute the necessary financial data and ratios for use by&#13;
its examiners and analysts in their examination and surveillance roles, as well as&#13;
provide an early warning system for the Director of Banking Supervision and the&#13;
BOT of the trends developing in the industry and/or a specific peer group. The&#13;
development of the data base for the, weekly, monthly and quarterly monitoring&#13;
activities of the Banking Supervision Department is to be funded outside of the&#13;
scope of this project.&#13;
o     On-site examination - Some of this work has already been developed, albeit in a&#13;
piecemeal fashion. It now needs to be brought together in a usable modular form&#13;
for the examiners to apply during their annual examinations. Funding for this&#13;
component was to have been provided by USAID. The timing of this USAID&#13;
support is now uncertain, and in the event it does not materialize, the&#13;
consultant(s), under the guidance of the IMF Advisor, will undertake this on-site&#13;
methodology role, in addition to the off-site and legal framework components&#13;
with the assistance of the specialists noted above, who will be charged with&#13;
reviewing and developing adequate methodology and modules in their areas of&#13;
expertise.&#13;
o     Ladders of Compliance - The Banking Act, Regulations and Guidelines gives&#13;
Banking Supervision enforcement powers necessary to protect depositors' funds&#13;
and cement their role in guarding the safety and soundness of the financial system.&#13;
The project will finance the completion of guidelines on the application of these&#13;
powers, the circumstances, and the legal, accounting or other constraints. It is&#13;
envisaged that this work would be spearheaded by the IMF Advisor Specialist and&#13;
enlist the expertise of consultants, including the Restructuring and Internal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
Control Consultants in designing practical, transparent and consistent responses&#13;
to areas of non-compliance with the Act and/or Regulations/Guidelines.&#13;
3.19. Training ($0.6 million). Much of the required training will be on-the-job. In&#13;
addition, it is proposed that as the new methodology is developed, the resulting&#13;
examination modules would be introduced in an internal training session, following which&#13;
these would be utilized in the on-site examination process. On-the-job training will be&#13;
supplemented by courses in the major risk areas. Annex 4 details the types of courses,&#13;
the skills to be developed, the duration and estimated cost. The majority of the training&#13;
will be in Tanzania and will be provided by local consultants, with expatriate assistance&#13;
only if local consultants cannot be found. In addition, the majority of the foreign training&#13;
relates to short term assignments in other regulatory agencies to broaden the exposure of&#13;
the on and off-site examiners to other complimentary regulatory jurisdictions.  All&#13;
training courses are designed for Banking Supervision personnel but will be promoted to&#13;
the financial system at large to encourage widespread participation of bankers and&#13;
financial institution personnel and management.&#13;
3.20. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the terms of reference and&#13;
work program for the consultants required for this component. Additionally, the&#13;
Government has agreed to provide for IDA's review and comment by October 31,&#13;
1995 and thereafter by September 30 in each year commencing 1996, annual&#13;
reports on the status of all financial institutions with action plans for the problem&#13;
institutions. The action plans will include a timetable for reaching regulatory&#13;
targets.&#13;
3.21. Insurance Regulations. ($0.5 million) The insurance sector consists of the&#13;
government owned National Insurance Corporation (NIC) and Zanzibar Investment&#13;
Corporation (ZIC).  The distribution system  includes 26 NIC  branches located&#13;
throughout the country, approximately 400 privately owned agents of which 260 are&#13;
active, one broker which is wholly owned by NIC, and various privately owned loss&#13;
adjuster services, etc. There is no domestic reinsurance market. NIC cedes directly to&#13;
the international market via one foreign broker. Reinsurance as a percent of gross&#13;
written premium, has decreased each year since its high of almost 35 per cent in 1981.&#13;
In 1991, it was approximately 21 per cent.&#13;
3.22. A new insurance act was recently drafted. The Act provides the framework for&#13;
the entry of private participants into the Tanzanian insurance market, based on objective,&#13;
minimal but prudent requirements. In addition, for the first time, the legislation provides&#13;
for prudent regulation of the industry to promote on-going confidence in the system.&#13;
The Govemment intends to establish a supervisory authority (an Insurance Commission).&#13;
The Commission would develop a supervisory methodology and policy framework,&#13;
including the drafting of regulatory guidelines and the supporting accounting principles&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
and standards to be adopted by the industry to meet the legislative requirements. In&#13;
addition, and concurrent with this activity, the Government intends to address the dearth&#13;
of actuarial expertise in Tanzania which is required to support the development of the&#13;
sector.&#13;
3.23. This component will finance a technical advisor for a period of up to two&#13;
years. The advisor will be required to:&#13;
*   draft  prudential regulations  for  licensing, regulating  and&#13;
supervising insurance companies. The regulations would establish&#13;
prudential controls and limits, such as exposure limits, capital&#13;
adequacy guidelines, and controls on related parties and enforce&#13;
corrective measures with specific guidance on dealing with&#13;
troubled institutions.&#13;
*  develop an implementation plan for the prudential regulations with&#13;
specific targets and time parameters to ensure that compliance is&#13;
achieved within the phase-in period,&#13;
*  develop a plan for the establishment of the Commission,&#13;
addressing staffing and training requirements;&#13;
*  review and recommend changes to other legislation affecting the&#13;
insurance industry to ensure harmony among the various acts.&#13;
Such acts include but are not limited to the Companies Ordinance&#13;
Act and the Tax Act.&#13;
3.24. The Advisor would reside in Tanzania and assist the Commissioner with the&#13;
design and implementation of supervisory functions.  During negotiations, the&#13;
Government agreed to submit to IDA by December 31, 1995 for review and&#13;
comments, the work plan for the establishment of the Commission, including&#13;
details of the resource requirements (e.g., size, scope, staffing, technology, etc.)&#13;
3.25. Studies Fund.($1.7 million).   The project will finance studies for the&#13;
development of a national payments system and a Credit Information Bureau.&#13;
3.26. Payments and Clearing System ($1.5 million). The effective functioning of a&#13;
financial system depends on the efficiency with which financial transactions are carried&#13;
out. An inefficient payments system hinders economic growth and is a binding constraint&#13;
to domestic and foreign trade.  Specifically, a well-functioning payment system  is&#13;
essential to the development of interbank money markets and securities markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
3.27. The present system of clearing payments in Tanzania is essentially a document&#13;
clearing system which depends upon physical transport of documents and therefore on&#13;
existing mail and transport systems. As such, while marginal improvements to the&#13;
system can be made, substantial improvements are unlikely. An alternative clearing&#13;
system would be one where the information content of the document is exchanged,&#13;
rather than the physical document, and would be based on telecommunications.&#13;
Although this alternative requires high-quality telecommunications to function efficiently,&#13;
it is possible to begin to develop such a system even with the relatively lower quality of&#13;
telecommunications currently available in Tanzania.&#13;
3.28. The study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase would collect and&#13;
analyze data about the payment traffic in Tanzania, assess the related institutional, legal&#13;
and financial infrastructure, estimate the costs of transactions, and generate realistic&#13;
projections of the transacting environment 5 years hence. The second phase would be&#13;
the design of improvements to the national payments system including an assessment of&#13;
the feasibility of the electronic exchange of data. The study's TORs would emphasize&#13;
common guiding principles including: (a) universality of access; (b) cost efficiency and&#13;
self financing through cost recovery; (c) integrity and reliability; (d) the minimization of&#13;
payment system risk; and (e) the involvement of major participants in the design of the&#13;
system. The master design study would make recommendations on the appropriate&#13;
division of labor between BOT and commercial banks with respect to the operations of&#13;
the system, and the extent to which operational resiliency needs to be built into the&#13;
payment system.&#13;
3.29. Credit Information Bureau ($0.2 million). There is no formal mechanism in&#13;
Tanzania for the sharing of credit information. Prior to the financial reform program,&#13;
when the market was dominated by Government-owned banks and when there were few&#13;
private borrowers, there was no demand nor need for it. The opening of the financial&#13;
sector to private banks will increase the demand for reliable financial and credit data over&#13;
time. Conversely, the lack of reliable financial information is a major deterrent to new&#13;
banks and to the development of the financial sector and capital markets.&#13;
3.30. This component will finance a feasibility study to determine: (i) if there is a&#13;
potential market for a credit information bureau in Tanzania; and (ii) if so, whether it&#13;
could become self-sustaining within a three year time frame. Specifically, the study will&#13;
be undertaken in two phases. The first phase would:&#13;
o     assess the readiness of private and state-owned companies and financial&#13;
institutions to participate in such an agency on a structured fee basis;&#13;
o     assess whether there is enough capacity in the market to support such an agency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
o     review potential ownership/membership structures;&#13;
o     review the legal framework and identify impediments and required changes;&#13;
o     cost justify (or not) the establishment of an agency; and&#13;
o     identify technical and other assistance requirements, including educating&#13;
participants, both banks and borrowers, on the value and use of such a vehicle.&#13;
3.31. The second phase would be contingent upon the outcome of the feasibility study&#13;
and would entail the preparation of a detailed five year business plan including a&#13;
recommendation for the ownership structure.&#13;
3.32. Agreement on the terms of reference for the studies were reached during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
Capital Market ($2.1 million)&#13;
3.33. The impetus for capital market development stems from the financing needs of the&#13;
private sector and the Government's objective of broad-based ownership of privatized&#13;
enterprises. The recorded pipeline of private investment projects has grown steadily on&#13;
the strength of Tanzania's economic reform program. Loan applications to the local and&#13;
external DFIs have grown substantially. However, disbursements have been modest&#13;
partly because of the inability of local investors to satisfy the related equity requirements.&#13;
The limited supply of medium-term credit and outside equity financing is a widely-&#13;
perceived constraint to the further growth of the private sector. The Government's&#13;
perception also is that the privatization program has been hampered by the absence of a&#13;
developed capital market which would enable broad participation in the program. The&#13;
Government has retained shares (ranging from 20 per cent to 50 per cent) in many of the&#13;
parastatals which have been privatized; the aim is to divest these shares to the public&#13;
when appropriate mechanisms for doing so have been developed.&#13;
3.34. Capital Markets and Securities Authority ($1.1 million). The Government&#13;
recognizes that a capital market requires certain pre-conditions for its successful&#13;
operation. These include Macro-economic stability, low inflation, public confidence in&#13;
the economic and political environment, a sound banking system, and adequate&#13;
accounting standards. Many of these conditions do not exist in Tanzania, and their&#13;
attainment will not be quick. Consequently, the Government has elected to adopt a&#13;
gradual approach to the development of capital markets. To this end, in January 1994&#13;
the Parliament approved a Capital Markets and Securities Act to promote the gradual&#13;
development of an efficient and fair capital market in Tanzania. The Act envisages the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
creation of an Authority to oversee the securities market. Initially, the focus will be on&#13;
the development of a simple over-the-counter (OTC) dealer market in securities.&#13;
3.35. The project will provide technical assistance to promote the development of a&#13;
capital market keeping in mind the Government's preference for a simple and&#13;
evolutionary approach. Specifically, assistance would be provided for:&#13;
the drafting and completion of a core set of enabling regulations;&#13;
an external advisor to provide regular assistance over the course of two years to&#13;
the Authority on a wide variety of regulatory and market development matters;&#13;
basic training of would-be stock brokers;&#13;
basic publicity and educational program  for the general public, including&#13;
nationwide distribution of information;&#13;
technical assistance to complete the first public issue including design of&#13;
distribution procedures, determination of offer prices, determination of&#13;
allotment procedures; provision of short 1-2 hour training sessions for&#13;
personnel nationwide on how to handle the public issue, supervision of the&#13;
allotment processing and so forth);&#13;
the preparation of a stock exchange blueprint and item-by-item action plan&#13;
together with donor funding requests for start-up costs.&#13;
3.36. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Borrower would&#13;
furnish to IDA an annual work program and budget for the Authority by October&#13;
31, 1995 and thereafter by September 30 in each year commencing in 1996. IDA&#13;
also received assurance of the Government that they would retain a Chief&#13;
Executive Officer, with qualifications and under terms of reference acceptable to&#13;
IDA, during the term of the project.&#13;
3.37. Privatization Trust Fund ($1.0 million) This component would also provide&#13;
funding for the establishment, on a pilot basis, and management of the first three years of&#13;
the Privatization Trust Fund (PTF). The Government intends to establish the PTF&#13;
mainly to broaden local participation in the privatization program. The Government&#13;
would transfer retained shares of privatized parastatals to the Trust in exchange for a&#13;
deferred payment and, upon successful disposition of an asset, the Government would be&#13;
paid. Blocks of shares could be broad'y distributed to the public through coUlective&#13;
instruments ( Unit Trust/Mutual Fund) or Stock Exchange.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
3.38. The PTF would be established for a period of five years by a Trust Deed. Its day&#13;
to day operations will be carried out by a private management company with access to&#13;
merchant banking expertise. The company's remuneration would be a combination of&#13;
fixed and performance related fees.&#13;
3.39. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the draft management&#13;
contract for the managers of the PTF and that the Borrower would ensure selection&#13;
of a management team by December 31, 1995.&#13;
D.    Proiect Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
3.40. Costs. Table 2 provides estimates of the project total costs. The estimates are&#13;
based on the costs of recruiting consultants for similar activities in Tanzania. These costs&#13;
include price contingencies of US$0.3 million (2 per cent of base costs) which were based&#13;
on projected international inflation rates of 2.0 per cent for 1995, 2.5 per cent for 1996,&#13;
2.7 per cent for 1997 and 2.5 per cent for 1998. Base costs have been estimated as of&#13;
August 31, 1994. It is assumed that the exchange rate will vary during the period to&#13;
adjust for the difference between local and foreign inflation. Estimates are based on&#13;
projected exchange rates (per US$) of Tsh 538 in 1995, Tsh 558 in 1996, Tsh 568 in&#13;
1997 and Tsh 571 in 1998. The first project year is assumed to run from July 1, 1995 to&#13;
June 30, 1996, and the completion date is expected to be September 30, 1998. The&#13;
costs exclude taxes and duties.&#13;

3.41. Financing. The proposed financing plan for the project is summarized in Table 3.&#13;
Govemment financing would pay for incremental costs including the costs of providing&#13;
facilities for training and a proportion of the costs of goods purchased locally. All project&#13;
financing would be passed on to beneficiary project institutions as grants from the&#13;
Government of Tanzania.&#13;

3.42. Government Counterpart Funds. The proposed IDA credit of $10.9 million&#13;
would finance 90 per cent of the project's costs net of taxes and duties.  The&#13;
Government's contribution will be provided partly by the Ministry of Finance and partly&#13;
by BOT. The proposed project has been designated a core investment project and&#13;
finding for the Government's share will be budgeted annually.&#13;
IV. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A.    Implementation Arraneeements&#13;
4.1.   The United Republic of Tanzania would be the Borrower (represented by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance) and the project executing agency would be the Bank of Tanzania.&#13;
The Bank of Tanzania would manage the program, coordinate its implementation, and&#13;
monitor its progress. The Director of the Financial Markets Directorate in the Bank of&#13;
Tanzania would be responsible for: (i) administering project funding and procurement&#13;
processing (including the employment of consultants) and managing the Project Accounts&#13;
and the Special Account; (ii) overseeing project implementation activities by various&#13;
institutions and coordinating activities; (iii) following up on the agreed conditionalities&#13;
and financial provisions and proposing any necessary adjustments and amendments to&#13;
implementation: (iv) providing periodic project progress reports; and (v) acting as the&#13;
focal point of contacts between the Government of Tanzania and IDA during the project&#13;
implementation period. The Financial Markets Directorate managed adequately the&#13;
technical assistance component of FSAC. However, its performance will be reviewed on&#13;
an on-going basis and adjustments, in terms of personnel, will be made by BOT if&#13;
necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
4.2.   Although BOT would assume day-to-day responsibility for implementation, the&#13;
Ministries of Finance, as the shareholders of NBC/TIB/THB and PBZ respectively, will&#13;
bear ultimate responsibility for the restructuring of these institutions.  Given the&#13;
complexity of the issues involved, an experienced commercial banker will be recruited to&#13;
advise both Ministries on the overall progress of the program. On the mainland, the&#13;
Advisors would report to the Ministry of Finance and work closely with the Parastatal&#13;
Sector Reform Commission. Issues raised by the Advisors would then be discussed by&#13;
the respective ministries during meetings of the Boards of Directors. The Advisors&#13;
would not be expected to reside in Tanzania but would be contracted to visit three times&#13;
per year. This arrangement will be reviewed as the project is supervised and will be&#13;
amended, if necessary. The terms of reference for the advisors were agreed during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
4.3.   BOT  will organize a project launch workshop shortly after the Board&#13;
presentation. The workshop would be intended to acquaint the project's beneficiaries&#13;
with the implementation arrangements.&#13;
B.    Procurement&#13;
4.4.  Procurement of goods and services would be implemented in accordance with&#13;
relevant World Bank Guidelines. For all contracts under Intemational Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) and internationally recruited consultants the Bank's standard bidding and&#13;
contract documents will be used.  Goods would include vehicles, computers, and&#13;
computer software, office furniture and equipment for a total value of $0.4 million&#13;
equivalent including contingencies. Goods amounting to roughly $0.2 million, mainly&#13;
consisting of personal computers for some of NBC's rural branches, would be grouped&#13;
into minimum packages of roughly US$100,000 each to be procured through ICB.&#13;
Where ICB procedures are used, a preferential margin of 15 per cent, or the applicable&#13;
customs duty, whichever is less, over the c.i.f prices of competing goods would be given&#13;
to domestic manufacturers in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.  Vehicles,&#13;
amounting to roughly $0.1 million, would be purchased in accordance with local&#13;
competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. Items or groups of items for goods which cannot&#13;
be packaged in contracts larger than $50,000 (mainly office equipment and supplies)&#13;
would be purchased on the basis of prudent international and \or local shopping based on&#13;
price quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers. The total value of goods&#13;
to be procured through prudent shopping procedures would not exceed an aggregate&#13;
amount of $100,000.&#13;
4.5.  Consultants, financed by IDA, totaling $10 million equivalent would be&#13;
contracted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants issued in&#13;
August 1981.  Consultancy services would include experts in commercial bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
management and restructuring - two highly specialized fields. Other consultants would&#13;
be recruited for training activities and the preparation of manuals.&#13;
4.6.   Procurement Review. All contracts for goods procured under ICB would be&#13;
subject to IDA prior review procedures. All other contracts less than $100,000 each&#13;
would be subject to IDA post review procedures. All consultancy contracts, with firms,&#13;
valued at the equivalent of $50,000 or more will be subject to IDA prior review&#13;
procedures. Prior review procedures would apply regardless of the value of the contracts&#13;
with respect to terms of reference, single source contracts, critical assignments, and&#13;
contract amendments valued at more than $50,000 or that raise total contract value&#13;
above $50,000 equivalent. In addition, an understanding was reached that before the first&#13;
contract below $50,000 is awarded, IDA would still review all stages of the consultants'&#13;
contract. For individual consultants, all contracts would be subject to IDA's prior review.&#13;
GOT would promptly report on contract awards and furnish to IDA quarterly reports&#13;
giving updated information on bidding packages and contracting. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that the borrower would apply the procurement&#13;
procedures outlined  above.  Also, during  negotiations standard  procurement&#13;
processing time was agreed with the borrower and incorporated in the&#13;
implementation schedule. Finalization of Standard Bidding Documents for critical&#13;
contracts was a condition of Board Presentation. Table 4 summarizes the proposed&#13;
procurement arrangements.&#13;

C.    Disbursements&#13;
4.7.   The proposed project is expected to be implemented in four years and to be&#13;
completed by December 1998.  The official closing date will be June 30, 1999.&#13;
Disbursements of IDA funds would be made against major categories as shown in Table&#13;
5. To facilitate timely project implementation, it is proposed that the borrower establish,&#13;
maintain and operate, under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA a Special Account&#13;
in US dollars with an authorized allocation of US$250,000 in a bank acceptable to IDA.&#13;
This allocation represents four months of projected expenditures. The Special Account&#13;
will be replenished on a timely basis either when the balance of the Special Account is&#13;
half of the initial deposit or on a one to three month basis, whichever occurs earlier. All&#13;
IDA disbursements should be channeled through the Special Account except for large&#13;
payments (10% of the value of the initial deposit) which would cause it to be significantly&#13;
depleted and would be submitted directly for processing outside of the Special Account.&#13;

4.8.   Disbursements for all IDA financed expenditures under the project would be&#13;
made against full documentation except as outlined below. Reimbursement of eligible&#13;
expenditures in both local and foreign currency would be made solely on the basis of&#13;
statements of expenditure (SOEs) in respect of contracts for goods valued for less than&#13;
$100,000 equivalent, consulting services for firms valued for less than $50,000 and all&#13;
local training and study programs. All documentation related to such expenditures would&#13;
be retained by the Borrower for IDA review during project supervision.&#13;
D.    Auditing and Reporting Requirements&#13;
4.9.   BOT will maintain records of all transactions under the Credit in accordance with&#13;
sound accounting practices. No later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, all&#13;
accounts will be audited by independent auditors acceptable IDA and submitted to the&#13;
Association. Audit reports will include a separate opinion with regard to the claims&#13;
submitted to IDA on the basis of SOEs and would state whether the claims were made in&#13;
accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Government would document&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
local cost contributions within the Credit's financial control procedures for appropriate&#13;
auditing.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the borrower would&#13;
implement the provisions described above with regard to project accounting and&#13;
auditing. The borrower also is required to submit annually the audited accounts of&#13;
NBC and PBZ within six months of the end of each bank's financial year.&#13;
E.    The Role of Technical Assistance&#13;
4.10  Attempts would be made to recruit resident and non-resident Tanzanians as well&#13;
as nationals of other African countries for the consultancies financed under the proposed&#13;
credit.  Nevertheless, the TORs for all consultants would require consultants to&#13;
progressively transfer their knowledge, know how and responsibilities to their local&#13;
counterparts. Because of the highly specialized and complex nature of the tasks involved,&#13;
the majority of the technical assistance will be long term. In some cases, a two year&#13;
resident contract would be followed by a one year non-resident contract. All contracts&#13;
would be performance based and the incumbents would be evaluated against identified&#13;
monitorable indicators. A part of the remuneration under the management contracts for&#13;
NBC and the PTF would be related to the financial performance of both institutions.&#13;
Draft TORs for all consultancies are included in Annex 7.&#13;
4.11  The bulk of the training program will be targeted to Bank Supervision in BOT,&#13;
however, financial sector personnel and management will be encouraged to attend. A&#13;
detailed program is included in Annex 3. All training would be in country although it is&#13;
envisaged that foreign trainers would be brought in to deliver and/or assist the resident&#13;
consultants with the courses. This is necessary because of the lack of bank restructuring&#13;
experts in Tanzania. There is also a small provision in the training budget to fund&#13;
exposure for select supervision personnel in other compatible regulatory agencies e.g.&#13;
USA and South Africa.&#13;
F.    Supervision&#13;
4.12. IDA supervision missions would be staffed to facilitate a transfer of know-how in&#13;
the complex areas addressed by the project. Consequently, the supervision requirements&#13;
would be higher than normal technical assistance projects and it is envisaged that IDA&#13;
would field three supervision missions per year. In addition, the Resident Mission, which&#13;
would play a lead role in assisting the Government with the formulation of a rural&#13;
banking strategy, would be expected to play a major role in supervision. A joint IDA-&#13;
Government mid-term review of the project would be conducted about 20 months into&#13;
the project (approximately March, 1997) as a basis for determining implementation&#13;
progress and mid-course adjustments, if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
G.   Environmental ImDact&#13;
4.13 Category C. The project would have no adverse impact on the environment.&#13;
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    Benefits.&#13;
5.1. The project will address a major market imperfection by supporting a strategy for&#13;
aggressively reducing the market share of the Government owned banks, thereby placing&#13;
the issue of privatization within the context of an appropriate competition policy for the&#13;
sector. Increased competition would improve the quality of banking services. This,&#13;
coupled with improvements to the financial infrastructure, should lower the costs of&#13;
financial intermediation while facilitating overall economic management. Also, stronger&#13;
bank supervision will help build public confidence and mobilize savings. The financial&#13;
sector would thus stimulate, as opposed to retard, economic growth. The project also&#13;
would address a Government concern about the need for broad based participation in the&#13;
privatization effort by creating the appropriate regulatory environment for capital market&#13;
instruments.&#13;
B.    Risks.&#13;
5.2.  The project is designed to mitigate the major risk to NBC's successful&#13;
restructuring: a reversal of Government's stated commitment to the bank's&#13;
commercialization. Consequently, the actions required for the significant downsizing of&#13;
NBC are all either up front or very early in the project's implementation. In addition,&#13;
NBC's management would be required to adhere to strict performance targets.&#13;
Conversely, the aggressive downsizing of NBC could result in the rapid entry of new&#13;
banks to fill the void and could stretch the limited capacity of Bank Supervision. The&#13;
extensive amount of technical assistance provided under the credit to Bank Supervision is&#13;
meant to reduce this risk.&#13;
5.3.  Another risk addressed by the project stems from the rapid opening up of&#13;
Tanzania's capital market in the absence of an appropriate regulatory framework. The&#13;
project would support the gradual evolution of the capital market while putting in place&#13;
an appropriate regulatory framework.&#13;
5.4.  Finally, despite  the  technical assistance  provided  under the  project,&#13;
implementation could suffer from a lack of capacity within Tanzania to address the&#13;
project's complex issues. In addition to regular supervision visits, IDA staff, including&#13;
staff at the Resident Mission, will liaise closely with Government officials during the&#13;
project's implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS AND ASSURANCES&#13;
6.1   The conditions of effectiveness would be:&#13;
a.    Completion of the diagnostic evaluation of NBC and a time-bound action&#13;
plan (including an interim business plan and a recovery plan for NBC's top&#13;

Dear Mr. Preston.&#13;
RE:- FINA _NCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPMEUNT PROJECT&#13;
LETTER OF FIN-kNCLAL POLICY&#13;
Recognizing the vital importance of ensuring the effective mobilization&#13;
and allocation of capital through the use of efficient financial svstems. the&#13;
Government of Tanzania initiated the financial sector reform program in&#13;
1991 with the support of an IDA credit for financial sector adjustment&#13;
(FSAC). The program included the development of a money mark-et and&#13;
indirect methods of monetary policv controL passage of new banking laws&#13;
and prudential rezulations. the creation of a competitive environment and the&#13;
introduction of private participation in the banking sector. restructuring of&#13;
the three government-owned commercial banks. and initial steps to promote&#13;
the emergence of a capital market in Tanzania through the enactment of the&#13;
Capital Markets and Securities Act. The Government is satisfied that the&#13;
prooram has been successful in deregulating and liberalizing the banking&#13;
system. We now have a financial svstem in which the basic legislation and&#13;
regulations necessarv for a market-oriented financial infrastructure are in&#13;
place. and monev and foreign exchange markets are emer2ins where both&#13;
interest rates and exchange rates are deter-mined by market forces. However.&#13;
we realize that the financial sector is still verv weak and the reform agenda is&#13;
far from complete. Although the reforrn prosram has opened Tanzania s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
financial sector to private participaits. the government-owned banlks still&#13;
domiiinate the sector. Furthermiiore. the pace of their restruLICtUring lhas been&#13;
slower than expected and the banks remaini undercapitalized and illiquid.&#13;
T'he payments system remiiainis very rudimienitary and inefficieit, and there&#13;
are no financial instruments and mlarkets to satisfN thle demianid lor term&#13;
financing. On the regulatory side, althougl thiere has been improvements in&#13;
Bank Supervisioni. this functioni remainis weak andincapable of overseeing&#13;
the complex banlk restructuring programs as well as the expansioni of the&#13;
sector.&#13;
The Government realizes that the development of a market oriented&#13;
financial system is a complex process wvhich will require sustained efforts&#13;
over many years and it wishes to reaffirm its commitmenit to the attainmenit&#13;
of an efficient financial system whiciI is competitive and which operates on&#13;
sound commercial principles. To achieve this objective and to regain the&#13;
momentum for financial sector reform. the Govenimenit is implementinga a&#13;
strategy which would address the renainiin v weaknesses in thie sector while&#13;
building the foundation for the diversification of financial instruments. Tlhe&#13;
main elements of the strategy are: 1) encouraging competition in the&#13;
commercial banking sector. 2) strengtlheniitng banking rezulation and&#13;
supervision; 3) improving the payments mechaniismii in the country; 4)&#13;
implementing comprehensive parastatal reforms. including privatization. of&#13;
state owned enterprises; 5) developing a market for Government securiLies 6)&#13;
establishing a regulatorv structure for securities and insuranice markets, and&#13;
7) developing a corporate securities market.&#13;
ENCOURAGING BANKING COMPETITION&#13;
_ -  The Government is committed to allowing banking institutons to&#13;
operate free from governmient intervention witlhin the norms of prudenitial&#13;
regulation. The Government intends to foster competition and improve&#13;
efficiency in the banking sector by continuing to encourage the entry of&#13;
private and foreign financial institutions. and by reducinig the size and&#13;
diversifving the ownership of government owned banks. This&#13;
encouragement to new entranits. however. will be based on a rigorouls and&#13;
transparenit licensing process which complemenits the Government's vision&#13;
for a safe and sound financial sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
Our aim is to ensure that the financial sector is capable of meeting the&#13;
credit and investment needs of a broad range of customers. New banks have&#13;
tended to remain in Dar Es Salaam and have been very selective both in&#13;
terms of the breadth of their client base and their product lines.&#13;
Consequently. the eXisting concentration in the banking sector is undesirable&#13;
and is not conducive to the development of the sector.&#13;
We, therefore. wish to reafiirm our commitment to increased&#13;
competition in the banking sector through the down sizing of National Bank&#13;
of Commerce (NBC). We have explored many options and our preferred&#13;
course of action includes a staged approach to reduce NBC's domination of&#13;
the sector. This would include implementation of a divestiture strategy for&#13;
NBC, including: (a) the divestiture of at least one urban branch network&#13;
based on the diagnostic evaluation; (b) the strengthening and reorganization&#13;
of NBC and its operations under professional management (c) the&#13;
establishment of a joint venture corporate subsidiary between NBC and a&#13;
major international banking partner to enable NBC to compete with its&#13;
counterparts in the market, and (d) developing a plan for addressing NCB's&#13;
impaired loan portfolio.&#13;
A number of organizational and operational changes have been&#13;
implemented within NBC. The Bank was recapitalized in 1993 by a&#13;
government bond. The Board of Directors was reconstituted at the end of&#13;
March 1994. A total of 23 loss-making branches have been closed and&#13;
roughly 2,800 staff have been retrenched. Lending to non-performing&#13;
borrowers has stopped and an overall ceiling has been imposed. This ceiling&#13;
will continue until NBC's Restructuring Plan is complete and measurable&#13;
rcontrol targets are instituted. The NBC Act has been amended to clear the&#13;
way for the bank's privatization. With the support of the proposed Financial&#13;
Institutions Development Project (FIDP), a privatization strategy will be&#13;
adopted and following completion of the diagnostic study., a detailed&#13;
timetable will be drawn up by the Board to implement the divestiture&#13;
strategy. However, the Government intends to complete this aspect of&#13;
NBC s divestiture by September 1995. In the meantime. a number of&#13;
qualified commercial bankers will be recruited for. at a minimum. the kev&#13;
line management positions of Chief Operating Officer. Chief Financial&#13;
Officer and Treasurer. and the senior credit risk management role at NBC.&#13;
It is the intention that these newly-recruited managers will bring about a&#13;
change in the culture of NBC and improve its operational efficiencv. Once&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
installed, this management team will be mandated with the development of&#13;
the Restructuring Plan, includina a recovery for the non performing loans, to&#13;
ensure that NBC attains self-sustainabilitv. Should NBC fail to improve its&#13;
operational efficiency and continue to make losses, however, the&#13;
Government is no longer prepared to recapitalize it. In order to meet capital&#13;
adequacy requirements, the bank will have to eithet reduce its asset base&#13;
through sales or look for additional equity capital from other sources. A&#13;
restructured NBC will operate solely on a commercial basis.&#13;
While addressing the future strategy of NBC, the Government is very&#13;
cognizant of the importance of rural finance to the economic and social&#13;
development of Tanzania. Consequently, the Government is committed to&#13;
maintaining a banking presence in the rural areas, and will strive to develop&#13;
mechanisms to ensure financial services are supplied on a national basis.&#13;
The Government would also like to restate its commitment to the&#13;
privatization of CRDB, and to the objective of CRDB meeting prudential&#13;
standards. The CRDB management is working closely with DANIDA and&#13;
committing significant effort to its restructuring program and loan recovery.&#13;
It is understood, however, that the restructuring process cannot go on forever&#13;
and consequently, we have established May 1995 as the date by which&#13;
CRDB will complete its restructuring program and meet the capital&#13;
adequacy standards. Until such time as its recapitalization prozram is&#13;
complete, CRDB will freeze all lending. Should the bank's eventual viability&#13;
prove to be unsustainable by June 1995 and the bank is unable to statisfy&#13;
the normal prudential requirements by this time, the authorities will revoke&#13;
CRDB's provisional bank-ing license.&#13;
The complex and difficult restructuring programs will require a highly&#13;
competent and capable banking supervision function. The Banking and&#13;
Financial Institutions Act of 1991 strengthened BOT's supervision authority&#13;
and. in November 1992, banking supervision was elevated to the status of&#13;
Directorate and staffing levels were increased. However, the technical&#13;
abilities and staffing levels of the Directorate of Bank Supervision (DBS) at&#13;
BOT. at present. are insufficient to meet the requirements of a market&#13;
oriented financial system. The Directorate needs to improve substantially if&#13;
it is to perform its functions properly as one of the architects of the emerging&#13;
financial svstem. The Government, therefore, assigns a high priority to the&#13;
strengthening of the capacitv of BOT to supervise the financial systern. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page S of 7&#13;
govemment would also like to restate its full support to DBS in its effort to&#13;
make greater use of its enforcement powers. including the ability to impose&#13;
penalties and issue cease and desist orders as well as the abilit; to remove&#13;
bank management as necessary.&#13;
DEVELOPING CAPITAL MARKETS&#13;
In order to address the financing needs of the private sector and to&#13;
promote broad-based ownership of privatized enterprises, the Government&#13;
intends to facilitate the development of capital markets in Tanzania.&#13;
Although the recorded pipeline of private investment projects has grown&#13;
steadilv since the start of the economic reform program, there has been only&#13;
modest disbursement by local and external DFIs and foreign investors. The&#13;
limited supply of medium-term credit and outside equity financing is a&#13;
widelv-perceived constraint to the further growth of the private sector.&#13;
Furthermore, the Government wishes to make use of the capital markets to&#13;
promote broad participation in the parastatals privatization program. In the&#13;
absence of a formal capital markets, the Government has retained shares&#13;
(ranging from 20% to 50%) in many of the parastatals which have been&#13;
privatized. But the Government intends to divest these shares to the public&#13;
when appropriate mechanisms for doing so have been developed.&#13;
The Government recognizes that capital market development requires&#13;
certain pre-conditions. These include macroeconomic stability, low inflation,&#13;
public confidence in the economy and political environment, a sound&#13;
banking systern, an efficient pavments system. adequate accounting&#13;
standards and investor sophistication. Many of these conditions are not met&#13;
in Tanzania at the current time. Achieving these conditions will iot be&#13;
quick, and in fact, only some of these issues are within the government's&#13;
direct power to deliver. What the government can do is to provide an&#13;
adequate regulatory environment which is conducive to the emergence of a&#13;
capital market. On the one hand. the Government is committed to&#13;
maintaining macroeconomic stability throuzh stringent fiscal discipline and&#13;
prudent monetarv policy, and on the other hand, the Government will&#13;
facilitate the co-operation between the relevant parties to create the&#13;
necessary market infrastructure and enactment of legislation and re2ulations.&#13;
For instance. Bank of Tanzania will take the lead and co-ordinate between&#13;
commercial banks to improve our payments system. In terms of building up&#13;
an approprinate legal environment. a "Capital Markets and Securities Industry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
Act" has been enacted and a Capital Mark-ets and Securities Authority has&#13;
been created. Both these vehicles seek to promote the development of an&#13;
efficient, orderly. transparent and safe capital mark-et and securities industrv&#13;
in Tanzania.&#13;
The securities market will operate initiallv as-a dealer market on an&#13;
over-the-counter basis. The Government also recognizes that the lack of&#13;
market intermedianres (brokers and dealers) is the missing link between&#13;
suppliers of and investors in securities. To promote the development of&#13;
mark-et intermediaries, the treasury bill mark-et seems to be the logical&#13;
starting point. At present, participation in the treasury bill auction is open to&#13;
all institutions, companies and individuals, and therefore, the incentive for&#13;
the development of a secondary market in which dealers maintain and trade&#13;
inventories of securities is weak. To facilitate the formation of a secondary&#13;
market and to promote the development of dealers, Bank of Tanzania is&#13;
considering limiting participation in the treasury bill auction to "approved&#13;
dealers". Dealing in other fixed-income, and eventually, in equity securities&#13;
will develop as these dealers gain experience, capital and customers. In the&#13;
mean time, should the private sector seek to establish a stock exchange, the&#13;
CMSA should ensure that its membership, organization, trading and&#13;
settlement mechanism are in the public interests. The Authoritv should also&#13;
make public education and promotion programs connected with securities&#13;
markets a basic market responsibility of the stock exchange until conditions&#13;
have been met to commence listing and trading.&#13;
The government wishes to reaffirm its commitment to the continuation&#13;
of the parastatal sector reform process. The Parastatal Sector Reform&#13;
-commission (PSRC) is implementing an action plan under which'about 227&#13;
parastatals will be privatizatized dunrng the period from 1993 through 1997.&#13;
It is hoped that some companies will be suitable for public flotation and such&#13;
initial public offerings will provide an impetus to the development of a&#13;
securities market in Tanzania. The Government wishes to see that a large&#13;
section of the population will become shareholders in these companies and&#13;
the achievement of this objective will be facilitated by the creation of&#13;
collective investment schemes such as unit trusts. Since the establishment of&#13;
unit trusts is likely to take time before they become operational. the&#13;
Government intends to establish a Privatization Trust Fund to -warehouse"&#13;
minority Government share-holdings of privatized parastatals while&#13;
conditions for proper unit trusts mature.&#13;

CONCLUSION&#13;
In view of the financial sector reform measures that have already been&#13;
initiated and those that are expected to be implemented in the near future. as&#13;
discussed above, the Government requests your favourable consideration of&#13;
the proposed Financial Institutions Development Project. I am sure that this&#13;
project will significantly contribute to the improvement of our financial&#13;
system and we are committed to the implementation of the project with the&#13;
utmost efficiency and quality.&#13;

TANZANIA&#13;
Privatization Trust Fund&#13;
Rationale&#13;
1.    The rationale for the Privatization Trust Fund (PTF) is to enhance broad based&#13;
participation in the privatization program. The warehousing role of the PTF is intended to&#13;
eliminate the requirement for ongoing government involvement with (or potential interference in)&#13;
the disposition of remainder interests, and to increase the comfort of potential buyers of partially&#13;
liquidated parastatals. The latter would be attained because local "partner" (i.e. the PTF) in the&#13;
venture will be guided by legally grounded fiduciary (rather than political) motivations. The&#13;
irrevocable trust vehicle which is assumed to underpin this Trust further enhances its&#13;
independence from incidental influence or considerations of temporary expediency.&#13;
2.    The rationale for the PTF is that it preserves the availability of shares for acquisition by&#13;
citizens of the host country at a time in the future when such acquisition becomes possible. This&#13;
can be achieved without inhibiting the privatization process. Also, an advantage of the PTF is its&#13;
facility allows the development of the divestment methods best suited to achieve its objectives and&#13;
its ability to adapt to circumstances as they may develop from time to time. More importantly it&#13;
avoids the needs to predetermine strategies for application in years to come which could prove to&#13;
be inappropriate and therefore unlikely to succeed.&#13;
Description&#13;
3.           The Privatization Trust Fund would be set up as a non-capitalized trust vehicle to&#13;
receive shares, from Government ownership, in newly privatized enterprises (NPEs) and to hold&#13;
such shares for sale at a later stage as the Trustees of PTF may decide in order to achieve as wide&#13;
a distribution as is possible among Tanzanians. The proposed initiative would establish a non-&#13;
capitalized but technically supported local, independent PTF.  The Trust is meant to be a&#13;
temporary repository for the orientation of non-liquidated interests in privatized parastatal&#13;
companies for future sale. The initiative has the following long-term goals:&#13;
(i)    broad ownership of productive enterprises;&#13;
(ii)   to assist shifting ownership of productive enterprises from the public to the private&#13;
sector;&#13;
(iii)  to provide an incentive to attract qualified private owner/managers capable of&#13;
augmenting the value of privatized assets;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
51&#13;
(iv)   to maximize, when possible, the financial value realized via the sale of privatized&#13;
assets, and distribute the proceeds for the benefit of the public;&#13;
(v)   to encourage or facilitate establishment or development of institutional investors&#13;
which in turn will foster the development of a capital market; and&#13;
(vi)  to facilitate the establishment of collective financial instruments (unit trust and&#13;
mutual fund).&#13;
Objective:&#13;
4.    The PTF will have the following objectives:&#13;
(i)   enable the widest number of Tanzanian citizens to participate in the privatization&#13;
process;&#13;
(ii)   ensure transparency;&#13;
(iii)  ensure the divestiture program  are in conformity with other shareholder's&#13;
objectives;&#13;
The following related benefits are expected as the result of achieving PTF objectives:&#13;
(i)   facilitation of the creation and development of a deeper capital and securities&#13;
market;&#13;
(ii)   facilitation of the privatization process.&#13;
5.    The PTF will be established in accordance with the Privatization Trust Act 1995. The&#13;
PTF will be managed by a private management company (the Management Company) of relevant&#13;
financial/merchant banking experience in accordance with a Trust Deed and a Management&#13;
Contract entered into with the Trustees. The responsibility for supervising the Management&#13;
Company and, in particular, for ensuring that its decisions are in conformity with the Trust Deed,&#13;
the Management Contract and the Divestment Policy will rest with the Board of Trustees of the&#13;
PTF.&#13;
The Trust Deed&#13;
6.           The PTF will be established by a Trust Deed (under PTF Act) between the&#13;
Government (PSRC) and the Trustees. The Trust will exist for a period of 5 years. If all the&#13;
shares are sold within that period, the PTF will be liquidated. If some shares remain unsold, the&#13;
PTF will be converted into a unit trust/mutual fund and floated to the public.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
52&#13;
7.          Once shares of the privatized companies have been transferred to the PTF, the&#13;
Government has no remaining control over these shares. The Government will however receive&#13;
any dividends paid on the shares and the ultimate sale proceeds minus the operation costs of the&#13;
PTF.&#13;
The Board of Trustees&#13;
8.          It is vital characteristic of the PTF that it is seen as being autonomous, objective,&#13;
and of the highest integrity. Accordingly the Trustees might be seen to have these characteristics&#13;
for the PTF to be perceived in the same way.&#13;
9.          The Board of Trustees will be comprised of five Trustees appointed by the&#13;
Minister of Finance from the private sector or professional association. The Trustees shall be of&#13;
good standing in the community so as to establish the PTF as an independent entity of the highest&#13;
integrity and professionalism. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman will be elected by the Board of&#13;
Trustees from among its members. The chairman and vice-chairman position will rotate among&#13;
board members. The trustees have security of tenure except in cases of bankruptcy or serious&#13;
misconduct.&#13;
10.        The function and responsibilities of the Trustees will be to:&#13;
(i)  supervise the operation of the Management Company;&#13;
(ii)   ensure that the Management Company performs in conformity to the Management&#13;
Contract (Annex 5), the Trust Deed, the PTF objectives and the Divestment Policy at all times;&#13;
(iii)  evaluate the performance of the Management Company in relation to the&#13;
Divestment Program;&#13;
(iv)   prepare annual financial statements of the PTF; and&#13;
(vi)  appoint independent auditors to audit the accounts of PTF. The auditors will&#13;
submit an independent opinion on the results of their review to the Board of Trustees. The audit&#13;
report will also be publicly released.&#13;
Selection Criteria for Purchase of Shares&#13;
11.         At the time of negotiations with the potential buyers of NPEs, PSRC will offer to&#13;
the PTF tninority shares of NPEs which are thought to be suitable candidates for a public offering.&#13;
The PTF will reject an offer of shares of a NPE if the Trustees consider that it does not meet the&#13;
PTF Objectives and selection criteria. The percentage of the shares of the NPE which will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
53&#13;
allotted for such purpose will be determined by PSRC, but never resulting in the operational&#13;
control of the NPE by the PTF.&#13;
12.         The PTF may accept the shares only if 51% of the shares of the NPE have been&#13;
sold to a majority shareholder or to several shareholders, then the PTF may accept the offer only&#13;
if those shareholders have entered into a shareholders agreement whereby the responsibility for&#13;
managing the NPE will rest with one of them.&#13;
13.         The PTF may not accept may offer of shares of a NPE if accepting this would&#13;
result in acquiring an effective controlling interest. The shares of the NPE must be, in the opinion&#13;
of the Trustees, well suited for a public floatation or a sale to suitable financial intermediaries.&#13;
Exercise of the Ownership Rights by the PTF&#13;
14.   Since the PTF will only accept ownership interests in NPEs which have either adequate&#13;
management in place or as the result of partial acquisition by a qualified investor/manager,&#13;
management of the PTF's interests in its portfolio companies should be restricted to the board&#13;
level interventions and involvement. The PTF will have the normal rights of a shareholder in the&#13;
NPE as set out in the Companies Act and the Articles of Association of the NPE concerned. It&#13;
will have the right to vote at the annual ordinary shareholders' meetings and at the extraordinary&#13;
shareholders' meetings. The PTF will receive dividend payments on its shares if and when&#13;
distributed by NPE. Such dividend payments will be made to an account specifically established&#13;
for that purpose in the name of the PTF.&#13;
The Management Company&#13;
15.   While the oversight of the PTF will be provided by a locally led Board of Trustees, the&#13;
Trust's day-to-day operations will be carried out by the management company with or access to&#13;
merchant banking expertise, preferably recruited locally. Outside technical assistance would be&#13;
made available to the PTF from time to time, as its needs dictated. For example, significant initial&#13;
TA will be required at the commencement of operations, and additional inputs must be available&#13;
to support each major asset "acquisition" or disposal.&#13;
16.   The Management Contract will be for the same period as the Trust Deed. It will set out&#13;
the functions and the responsibilities of the Management Company which will be to:&#13;
(i)   manage the PTF in accordance with the Trust Deed;&#13;
(ii)   evaluate the offers of shares made by the PSRC and advise and recommend to the&#13;
Trustees concerning the selection and acquisition of shares offered to the PTF and advise the&#13;
Trustees on policy matters;&#13;
(iii) manage the PTF share portfolio and monitor the progress of the portfolio;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
54&#13;
(iv)   advise and recommend to the Trustees on the divestment of shares in accordance&#13;
with the PTF Objectives and the divestment policy;&#13;
(v)   submit to the Board of Trustees quarterly activity reports and financial statement&#13;
of the PTF. The report will present the results of the various divestment actions undertaken by&#13;
the Management Company, including the types of buyers, the capital gains achieved, and the&#13;
progress accomplished to date relative to an agreed upon divestment program; and&#13;
(vi)  ensure that the Trustees comply with their continuing obligations under the laws&#13;
and regulations of the PTF.&#13;
Management Fee&#13;
17.         The Management Company's remuneration will be a combination of a fixed fee and&#13;
performance related fee. The fixed monthly fee would be to cover management overhead,&#13;
operating and administrative costs of the manager. A weighted performance related variable fee&#13;
would be to provide incentives for successfully achieving the agreed objectives of PTF. In&#13;
Tanzania where adequate resources are not directly available, technical assistance funding for the&#13;
PTF will be sought from IDA and local resources. .&#13;
18.         The management fee will cover all management, overhead, operating and&#13;
administrative costs, including the costs of the technical advisor, if any. However, it will not&#13;
cover the transfer costs of the shares, including the transfer taxes, stamp duties and registration&#13;
fees. Such transfer costs will be borne by the Government.&#13;
Divestment Program and Outline of the Divestment Policy&#13;
19.         The divestment program will include a time-table for the divestment of all shares&#13;
held in PTF. The time-table will set forth the approximate dates and the methods of divestment&#13;
shares.      The priority will be given to the small individual Tanzanians investor through&#13;
public offerings ensuring appropriate level of geographical coverage within Tanzania. However,&#13;
if capital market conditions are unfavorable, shares will be sold to the financial intermediaries&#13;
investing on behalf of Tanzanian citizens via collective financial instruments (such as unit trust or&#13;
mutual fund). This priority should be reflected in the determination of the selling price of the&#13;
shares and the ceiling for the number of shares which may be purchased by each individual or&#13;
institutional investor. Maximum transparency of the sales will be achieved through publicity and&#13;
promotional campaigns.&#13;
20.   The sales of shares of a NPE to a financial intermediary will not permitted if such a sale&#13;
would create new or reinforce existing dominant positions in specific markets in accordance with&#13;
the competitive environment envisioned for open market economy of Tanzania. The timing of the&#13;
divestment should take into account other public or private placement in order to avoid putting&#13;
excessive strain on the absorptive capacity of the stock market.  Therefore it is imperative, that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
55&#13;
maximum coordination is maintained with the governing body of the stock exchange, the PSRC,&#13;
and institutional investors in order to achieve this objective. The sale of shares of a NPE should&#13;
not result into creation of dominant position in specific markets and reduce competition. The&#13;
Trustees may decide to sell the shares of a NPE in one or several tranches based on the agreed&#13;
upon divestiture plan for each NPE recommended by the PTF management company.&#13;
Action Plan&#13;
21.   The PTF should be operational in time for receiving the minority shares of the NPEs&#13;
which are already in set aside. In order to achieve this goal, a draft Trust Deed, including PTF&#13;
objectives and divestment policy, and a draft Management Contract have been prepared. The&#13;
immediate potential outlook for PTF's portfolio appears to be in order of about 30 companies&#13;
with the face value of about $50mn at the time of share transfer to the Trust. The establishment&#13;
of the PTF and the appointment of Trustees should take place by June 1995. Selection and&#13;
appointment of the Management Company, rendering the PTF operational, along with the transfer&#13;
of the first block of shares to the PTF, should then be achieved before September 1995.&#13;

TANZANIA&#13;
DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF COMMERCE&#13;
UPDATED TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1. In 1991, the Government of Tanzania (GOT) initiated its financial sector reform&#13;
program. The aim of the program was to promote the efficient mobilization and allocation&#13;
of savings through an improved and more competitive financial system. The program&#13;
included: passage of the Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1991, which inter alia,&#13;
permitted the entry of private banks; strengthening of the Bank of Tanzania's monetary&#13;
policy and regulatory functions; restructuring of the three Government owned commercial&#13;
banks; and initial steps to promote the emergence of a capital market in Tanzania. As a&#13;
result, competition has been reintroduced to the sector with the opening of two&#13;
international commercial banks in the latter half of 1993, three additional expected in 1994.&#13;
2. The Government's strategy to-date has been to allow competition to gradually reduce&#13;
the market share of the largest state-owned bank, the National Bank of Commerce (NBC).&#13;
While this strategy has enjoyed some success, the success did not obviate the need to&#13;
recapitalize NBC. The recapitalization, which required the issuance of Tsh 150 billion in&#13;
treasury bonds at an annual expense to the GOT of Tsh 8.6 billion, was completed in&#13;
October, 1993 (FY 94). The Government wishes to minimize any further budgetary&#13;
infusions and therefore is aiming to accelerate the downsizing of NBC with a view to its&#13;
eventual privatization.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
3. The Government wishes to undertake a diagnostic study of NBC, with a view to&#13;
identifying the most beneficial options for privatizing the Bank. Considerations with&#13;
respect to that restructuring should be based more heavily on what is best for Tanzania's&#13;
banking system rather than what is best for NBC. These options could include (1) leaving&#13;
NBC the way it is, continuing the present efficiency reforms, and selling, say 40%, to the&#13;
general public; (2) splitting NBC into 2-4 pieces on either a regional or national basis, and&#13;
partially privatizing these pieces; (3) dividing NBC into an urban and a rural bank; and&#13;
(4) spinning off one or two attractive urban commercial networks to be sold to private,&#13;
well established commercial banks, forming a joint venture international/corporate&#13;
subsidiary and retaining within a partially privatized NBC the rural network and a national&#13;
presence in all city markets. These four options, along with their variants, broadly cover&#13;
the range of altematives to be considered. Option 4 appears to be a particularly attractive&#13;
strategy for privatizing NBC and thus it should receive priority during the diagnostic&#13;
study. An assessment of NBC's current and future financial viability is pertinent to the&#13;
evaluation of the alternatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57                              Annex 7.1&#13;
The Assignment&#13;
4. The consulting firm will be expected to (a) develop pro forma balance sheet and&#13;
income statements for any entities that will be either sold or spun-off as going concerns,&#13;
new NBC subsidiaries, and NBC after implementation of the selected privatization option;&#13;
(b) document the logistical implications and schedule inherent in Option 4 or other&#13;
preferable alternatives; and (c) manage a process of review and consultation for NBC, to&#13;
include management, Board of Directors, BOT and MOF.&#13;
5. To accomplish the above, adjustments to FY June 1994 financials should be made if&#13;
deemed necessary to fairly present the NBC's financial condition. Particular attention&#13;
should be paid to:&#13;
* loan related adjustments, e.g. provisions, non-accrual of interest income on non-&#13;
performing loans and overdrafts that arise from updating the 3/94 portfolio review to&#13;
6/94.&#13;
losses associated with items held in suspense, e.g. unreconciled inter branch clearing&#13;
accounts,&#13;
realized and unrealized losses/gains as a function of currency or asset/liability&#13;
mismatches, e.g. foreign exchange losses, interest rate bets&#13;
6. To support both the analysis of alternatives and implementation of the selected option,&#13;
the June 1994 actuals should be built up from the individual branch balance sheets and&#13;
income statements. Branch income statements should reflect both direct and fully&#13;
allocated head office costs, the cost of risk-adjusted equity,and funds credits/charges.&#13;
Branch balance sheets should describe the mix of loans by sector and type (private,&#13;
parastatal, other) as well as the level of non-performing, classified loans.   As a&#13;
consequence the pro formas required for Option 4 or any other will reflect the required&#13;
levels of capital, reserves, and liquidity.&#13;
8. On the basis of the analysis of actuals, recommendations should be made (and&#13;
subsequently reflected in the pro formas) that would enhance the profitability such that the&#13;
NBC, without, in the case of Option 4, the proposed joint venture subsidiary, could&#13;
operate at break-even profitability, but not at the expense of building the joint venture&#13;
subsidiary. Recommendations with respect to organizational effciency for the restructured&#13;
and downsized NBC desrcibed in the pro forma should be detailed.&#13;
Output&#13;
9. The output of the study will include: (a) disks containing clearly documented EXCEL&#13;
spreadsheets for branch balance sheet and income statements including relevant&#13;
memorandum items such as unpaid interest, headcount, number of deposits, loans data on&#13;
non-performing loans as well as all relevant aggregations/consolidations of the branches;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58                            Annex 7.1&#13;
(b) disks containing both the loan-by-loan detail and summary tables for the March 1994&#13;
and June 1994 loan portfolio reviws&#13;
(b) interm presentations, and a (c) final report.&#13;
Two interim presentations will be required. The first covering FY 94 actuals and the&#13;
results of the June 1994 loan portfolio review will be completed four weeks after the start&#13;
of the contract. The focus of the presentation is a review of the privatization options&#13;
based on preliminary branch analyses, FY1993/94 financial condition, and updated loan&#13;
portfolio review and a review of the restrucuring options. The second be done after six&#13;
weeks to present the adjusted pro formas balance sheets and income statements associated&#13;
with Option 4, as modified if it has been selected at the earlier meeting plus detailed&#13;
restructuring plans for review. The final report should incorporate the comments,&#13;
decisions of management received on the basis of the earlier presentations. The report will&#13;
be due 14 weeks after the beginning of the contract.&#13;

TANZANIA&#13;
PRIVATIZATION STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
THE NATIONAL BANK OF COMMERCE&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1. In 1991, the Government of Tanzania (GOT) initiated its financial sector reform&#13;
program. The aim of the program was to promote the efficient mobilization and allocation&#13;
of savings through an improved and more competitive financial system. The program&#13;
included: passage of the Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1991, which inter alia,&#13;
permitted the entry of private banks; strengthening of the Bank of Tanzania's regulatory&#13;
functions; restructuring of the three Government owned commercial banks; and initial&#13;
steps to promote the emergence of a capital market in Tanzania. As a result, competition&#13;
has been reintroduced to the sector with the opening of two international commercial&#13;
banks in latter half of 1993, three more already in 1994 and three in the licensing process.&#13;
2. The Government's strategy to-date has been to allow competition to gradually reduce&#13;
the market share of the largest state-owned bank, the National Bank of Commerce (NBC).&#13;
While this strategy has enjoyed some success, two recapitalizations were necessitated.&#13;
One in November, 1992 (FY 93) and another in October, 1993 (FY 94). Together they&#13;
required the issuance of Tsh 150 billion in treasury bonds at an annual expense to the GOT&#13;
of Tsh 8.6 billion. The Government wishes to minimize any further budgetary infusions&#13;
and therefore is aiming to accelerate the downsizing of NBC with a view to its eventual&#13;
privatization.&#13;
3. Concern has been heightened by NBC's performance in FY 93-94. Despite the&#13;
removal, recategorization or guarantee of Tsh 78.5 billion of 1992 non-performing loans,&#13;
the portfolio review indicates that over 70% of the 3/94 loan portfolio Tshl78 billion may&#13;
be non-performing, requiring provisions of approximately Tsh 65 billion. This level of&#13;
non performing loans suggests that prudential guidelines with respect to accrual of interest&#13;
income are not being met. Adjusting FY 93 gross loans for retrospective removal of loans&#13;
swapped for bonds reveals loan growth of 41%.&#13;
4. The Government is undertaking a diagnostic study of NBC to identify the most&#13;
beneficial options for privatizing the Bank.  Considerations with respect to that&#13;
restructuring will be based more heavily on what is best for Tanzania's banking system&#13;
rather than what is best for NBC. Four options include: (1) leaving NBC the way it is,&#13;
continuing the present efficiency reforms, and selling, say 40%, to the general public; (2)&#13;
splitting NBC into 2-4 pieces on either a regional or national basis, and partially&#13;
privatizing these pieces; (3) dividing NBC into an urban a rural bank; and (4) spinning off&#13;
or two attractive urban commercial networks to be sold to foreign commercial banks,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60                               Annex 7.2&#13;
forming a joint venture international/corporate subsidiary and retaining within a partially&#13;
privatized NBC the rural network and a national presence in all city markets. These four&#13;
options, along with their variants, appear to broadly cover the range of alternatives to be&#13;
considered. Option 4 appears to be a particularly attractive strategy for privatizing NBC&#13;
and thus it will receive priority during the diagnostic study. An assessment of NBC's&#13;
current and future financial viability is pertinent to the evaluation of the alternatives.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
5. The Government wishes to engage an investment bank or consulting firm to: (a)&#13;
recommend terms and conditions associated with the privatization strategy that emerges&#13;
from the diagnostic study, (b) implement the sale of portions of NBC's urban network,&#13;
and (c) seek a joint venture managing partner for an NBC international corporate&#13;
subsidiary.&#13;
The Assignment&#13;
6. The branch analyses, loan portfolio review, December 1994 actuals, and pro formnas&#13;
developed in the diagnostic review will be made available to the investment banking firm&#13;
for its own due diligence. The privatization strategy that emerges should be modified if&#13;
necessary to enhance its successful implementation. For example, if sale of only one urban&#13;
branch network seems feasible, a second "spin-off' in the form of individual branches in&#13;
some cities could perhaps be assembled.&#13;
7. Careful consideration will need to be paid to the asset/liability structure of each branch&#13;
to be spun-off. Recommendations with respect to the guarantees that need to be provided&#13;
to buyers should be detailed. While no buyer will buy large loans or potentially hidden&#13;
liabilities, sale of only fixed assets would be a disappointment.  For example, the&#13;
attractiveness and feasibility of structures that permit a buyer to put loans back after a&#13;
period of time or a loan should be evaluated.&#13;
8. The sales memorandum and private placement documents associated with the&#13;
privatization strategy should be specific not only with respect to balance sheets but also&#13;
with respect to NBC employees and fixed assets.&#13;
9. A forecast scenario that estimates returns for potential buyers should be prepared which&#13;
will reflect both the amount of investment required and the availability of guarantees or&#13;
subsidies that reduce risk for an initial period.  A recommendation with respect to&#13;
necessity of the government remaining as to a minority shareholder should be made. All&#13;
risks and costs of the transaction to GOT should be quantified. GOT should indicate its&#13;
willingness or its accomplishment of regulatory or statutory changes that are requires by&#13;
the sales of branches and establishment of a joint venture subsidiary in NBC.&#13;
10. The schedule of sales and the negotiation process will be directed by the investment&#13;
bank for the benefit of GOT as the client.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
61                              Annex 7.2&#13;
Output&#13;
11. The output will include (a) a preliminary set of terms and conditions for each element&#13;
of the strategy for review and agreement with GOT; (b) a list of potential acquirers and&#13;
investors meeting minimum requirements to be deemed acceptable, and (c) the sales&#13;
memorandum, private placement, and public offering of NBC shares documents as well as&#13;
a success criteria.&#13;
Timing&#13;
12. Preliminary terms and conditions and list of potential acquirers and investors should be&#13;
available four weeks after the start of the assignment. Preliminary drafts of the documents&#13;
should be available after three months. The sale and investments should be successfully&#13;
concluded six months after the start of the assignment.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
In 1991, the Government of Tanzania (GOT) initiated its financial sector reform program. The&#13;
aim of the program was to promote the efficient mobilization and allocation of savings through an&#13;

and Financial institutions Act of 1991, which inter alia, permitted the entry of private banks;&#13;
strengthening of the Bank of Tanzania's regulatory functions; restructuring of the three&#13;
Government owned commercial banks; and initial steps to promote the emergence of a capital&#13;
market in Tanzania. As a result, competition has been reintroduced to the sector with the opening&#13;
of two international commercial banks in the later half of 1993, three more already in 1994 and&#13;
three in the licensing process.&#13;
The Government's strategy to-date has been to allow competition to gradually reduce the market&#13;
share of the largest state-owned bank, the National Bank of Commerce (NBC). While this strategy&#13;
has enjoyed some success, two recapitalizations were necessitated.  One in November, 1992&#13;
(FY93) and another in October, 1993 (FY94). Together they required the issuance of Tsh 150&#13;
billion in treasury bonds at an annual expense to the GOT of Tsh 8.6 billion. The Government&#13;
wishes to minimize any further budgetary infusions and therefore is aiming to accelerate the&#13;
downsizing of NBC with a view to its eventual privatization. The strategy for doing so entails, in&#13;
part, the recruitment of experienced commercial bankers as Chief Operating Officer, Chief&#13;
Financial Officer and Treasurer, and Credit Manager.&#13;
The mandate of the senior management team will be to draft for review and comments and then&#13;
finalize and implement the business plan for the restructuring of NBC. The two key objectives of&#13;
restructuring NBC are (1) to increase competition in the financial sector and (2) to transform NBC&#13;
from a major loss making institution to at least a break-even position within the first year of the&#13;
contract period and, thereafter, to get NBC to a profitability level such that it would be self-&#13;
sustaining.&#13;
Chief Operating Officer&#13;
1.    The National Bank of Commerce wishes to recruit an individual for a minimum of three&#13;
years as Chief Operating Officer in NBC's Head Office in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The&#13;
successful candidate should have the following qualifications:&#13;

objectives. In view of the very serious financial position of the bank, the business&#13;
plan will include but not be limited to the specific cost cutting measures to be&#13;
implemented by the bank. This will include the number of branches/Head Office&#13;
departments to be closed or streamlined and delineate a staff retrenchment program&#13;
throughout the various levels of the bank. In line with the cost cutting initiatives,&#13;
the COO will implement specific financial performance measures against which he&#13;
and his senior management team will be measured. Financial targets will include&#13;

MINISTRY OF FINANCE&#13;
BANKING ADVISORS&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
In 1991, the Government of Tanzania (GOT) initiated its financial sector reform&#13;
program. The aim of the program was to promote the efficient mobilization and allocation&#13;
of savings through an improved and more competitive financial system. The program&#13;
included: passage of the Banking and Financial institutions Act of 1991, which inter alia,&#13;
permitted the entry of private banks; strengthening of the Bank of Tanzania's regulatory&#13;
functions; restructuring of the three Government owned commercial banks; and initial&#13;
steps to promote the emergence of a capital market in Tanzania. As a result, competition&#13;
has been reintroduced to the sector with the opening of two international commercial&#13;
banks in the later half of 1993, three more already in 1994 and three in the licensing&#13;
process.&#13;
The Government's strategy to-date has been to allow competition to gradually&#13;
reduce the market share of the largest state-owned bank, the National Bank of Commerce&#13;
(NBC). While this strategy has enjoyed some success, two recapitalizations were&#13;
necessitated. One in November, 1992 (FY93) and another in October, 1993 (FY94).&#13;
Together they required the issuance of Tsh 150 billion in treasury bonds at an annual&#13;
expense to the GOT of Tsh 8.6 billion. The Government wishes to minimize any further&#13;
budgetary infusions and therefore is aiming to accelerate the downsizing of NBC with a&#13;
view to its eventual privatization.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1 .    The overall objective is to advise the Ministries of Finance of both Zanzibar and&#13;
the mainland regarding the restructuring programs for the Government owned financial&#13;
institutions.&#13;
Assignment&#13;
2.    The Advisors would provide guidance to the respective Ministers of Finance as&#13;
follows:&#13;
* Review the progress of the restructuring plans and provide advice as to&#13;
whether the direction is appropriate, given the operating environment. Also,&#13;
the advisor should assess the overall appropriateness of the organizational&#13;
structure and the experience and depth of the senior management to achieve&#13;
the newly established corporate goals as defined in the business/restructuring&#13;
plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73                              Annex 7.5&#13;
Assist the Ministries in their assessment of the role of the boards in the&#13;
corporate governance process and recommend strengthening where required.&#13;
Consideration should be given to the mandate, composition and structure of&#13;
the boards and their committees. As well, do the boards have adequate&#13;
expertise to bring to bear on the issues facing the institution and are they&#13;
independent in exercising their responsibilities?&#13;
* Assess the role and effectiveness of external and internal audit within each of&#13;
these institutions and its relationship with the Board of Directors and the Audit&#13;
Committee. Address whether the scope of the external and internal audit&#13;
function is appropriate and independent.  Is the Board kept adequately&#13;
informed of material weaknesses within each of the institutions and do they&#13;
ensure senior management respond appropriately to external and internal audit&#13;
findings. In turn, is the respective Ministry kept apprised of major weaknesses&#13;
which impact the financial system as a whole.&#13;
* Assess the risk profile and risk tolerance of the restructured institutions and&#13;
advise the Ministries regarding the appropriateness of the credit risk&#13;
management and asset/liability management policies and practices and if and&#13;
how the board is exercising adequate oversight&#13;
* Assess the adequacy and integrity of the information provided to the boards.&#13;
Determine if the Management Infornation Systems within each of the&#13;
institutions is adequately designed and maintained to provide timely and&#13;
sufficient financial data to perrnit senior management and the board to monitor&#13;
financial performance against the business/restructuring plan to enable them to&#13;
respond to problems and developing trends.&#13;
3.    The consultant will be required to progressively transfer his/her knowledge, know-&#13;
how, and responsibilities to their local counterparts. The consultant will be deemed&#13;
accountable in this respect, and their performance will be evaluated on, among other&#13;
things, the extent to which such transfer actually takes places.&#13;
4.    The contracts will be renewable annually.&#13;
Outputs&#13;
The advisor will be called upon to prepare reports on major topics for presentation to the&#13;
Ministries of Finance, the boards and senior management of the institutions and potentially&#13;
other senior Government officials.&#13;
Skills&#13;
The advisor should be an experienced senior banker, having held an executive level&#13;
position in a large financial institution for a period of at least five years. Experience in the&#13;
&#13;

Introduction&#13;
1.    The aim of the Government of Tanzania's financial sector reform program is to&#13;
move from a concentrated inefficient government-owned financial system to a strong&#13;
privately-held competitive financial sector. The emergence of the latter is dependent on&#13;
the development of sound local and foreign financial institutions. To support the program,&#13;
many initiatives have been introduced or are underway. These include new banking&#13;
legislation passed in 1991 vesting in the central bank the powers to license, regulate and if&#13;
necessary, liquidate financial institutions.&#13;
2.    Two of three of the local banks are in the process of major restructuring efforts.&#13;
NBC, the dominant government controlled bank is currently undergoing significant&#13;
restructuring. CRDB, the main rural banking vehicle also is being restructured. Both&#13;
institutions are cited for varying degrees of privatization. The third government bank,&#13;
PBZ, is formulating its restructuring plan. A recovery trust vehicle was established to&#13;
hold and recover the non-performing portfolios of these institutions. Non-Bank Financial&#13;
Institutions (NBFIs) including, Tanzanian Investment Bank (TIB), Tanzanian Housing&#13;
Bank (THB), among others, need to be assessed to determine their long term position in&#13;
the financial market in view of their competitive strengths.&#13;

2.    The Bank Supervision Directorate since its inception in its new form in 1991 has&#13;
undertaken to develop a strong supervisory methodology designed according to the US&#13;
based system of CAMEL (capital, assets, earnings and liquidity) to address the risk in the&#13;
financial system. As would be expected in a market seized with a significant level of non-&#13;
performing assets, the main focus of the work to date has been in the area of assessing and&#13;
quantifying the level of credit/asset risk, the adequacy of capital with some work being&#13;
completed to address corporate governance of the Board of Directors, as well as the role&#13;
and effectiveness of the internal and extemal auditors.&#13;
3.    As a result of the initial focus on asset risk as noted above, little work has been&#13;
completed to address the areas of position (treasury) or operations (systems) risk. In&#13;
order to move the development of the methodology forward and to keep pace with the&#13;
liberalization of the financial system reinforced by the development of open market&#13;
operations (OMO) in Tanzania, the Directorate of Banking Supervision now needs to&#13;

assessment of the overall internal control environment of the local financial institutions&#13;
with specific emphasis placed on the role of the Board, the treasury and systems areas&#13;
including wire payments and money laundering detection practices within these&#13;
institutions, (2) develop, with the assistance of the IMF Advisor, the methodology to&#13;
address all the major areas relating to the intemal control environment, (3) provide on-the-&#13;
job training to the examination staff to support their risk identification and risk mitigation&#13;
skills in these high risk areas, (4) direct and oversee the completion of a cross system&#13;

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Government of Tanzania's is in the process of financial sector reforn. The aim is to move&#13;
from a concentrated inefficient government-owned financial system to a strong privately-held&#13;
competitive financial sector. The emergence of the latter is dependent on the development of sound&#13;
local and foreign financial institutions and, concurrently, to promote the development of a viable capital&#13;
market sector. To support these initiatives many programs have been introduced or are underway.&#13;
These include new banking legislation passed in 1991 vesting in the central bank the powers to license,&#13;
regulate and if necessary, liquidate financial institutions, as well as the establishment of a Capital&#13;
Markets Authority to promote the development of the stock market (including an OTC) and to ensure it&#13;
is designed with the appropriate regulations and control framework in place.&#13;
2.    In conjunction with the macro financial framework, the Banking Supervision Directorate since&#13;
inception in its new form in 1991, has undertaken to develop a strong supervisory methodology&#13;
designed according to the US based CAMEL system (capital, assets, eamings and liquidity). As would&#13;
be expected in a market seized with a significant level of non-performing assets, the main focus of the&#13;
on-site work to date has been in the area of assessing and quantifying the level of credit/asset risk, the&#13;
adequacy of capital, with some work being completed to address corporate governance of the Board of&#13;
Directors, as well as the role and effectiveness of the intemal and extemal auditors. As a result of this&#13;
initial focus on asset risk, little work has been completed to address the areas of position (treasury) or&#13;
operations (systems) risk. In order to move the development of the methodology forward and to keep&#13;
pace with the liberalization of the financial system and the development of open market operations&#13;
(OMO) in Tanzania, the Directorate of Banking Supervision now needs to address the remaining risk&#13;
areas and develop adequate methodology to guide its examination staff in their on-site supervisory&#13;
work.&#13;
3.    Additionally, a rudimentary system of off-site surveillance has been developed and is in&#13;
operation. However, the reporting requirements are incomplete, onerous and not well integrated with&#13;
other information requirements of the Bank of Tanzania (BOT). Consequently, a major revamping of&#13;
the system needs to be undertaken and a data base developed to support the examination staff and the&#13;
work of the financial analyst group.&#13;
4.     An equally important area which remains also to be addressed is the area of supervisory&#13;
powers and their proper application. A review of the current and proposed powers needs to be&#13;
undertaken to develop a framework in the form of guidelines regarding the application of the&#13;
supervisory powers, the circumstances in which the powers would be exercised and the legal,&#13;
accounting and other constraints restricting the enforcement of these powers.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 7.8&#13;
Objective&#13;
5     The objective of the assignment is to co-ordinate and finalize the development of the on-site&#13;
methodology, review and amend the off-site surveillance system including the development of a&#13;
financial data base, as well as articulate the practical application of the regulatory powers to ensure&#13;
their consistent and transparent enforcement.&#13;
The Assignment&#13;
6.    Technical assistance will be expected to report directly to the Director, Banking Supervision&#13;
with a dotted line reporting relationship to the IMF Advisor to the Govemor of the BOT. The&#13;
incumbent will work in a line position with the intention that his/her understudy will assume the&#13;
responsibilities upon completion of the assignment. Specific responsibilities will include:&#13;
a)    develop a complete on-site examination methodology using the CAMEL framework,&#13;
which can be used by on-site examination staff in the completion of their supervisory&#13;
work. This will involve reviewing the methodology completed to date, amending&#13;
and/or upgrading it as required, and in co-operation with the Restructuring&#13;
Specialist(s), the Internal Control Specialist and the IMF Advisor to develop the&#13;
remaining segments of the CAMEL methodology such that all major risk areas are&#13;
documented including compliance with the laws and regulations.&#13;
b)    develop a complete off-site surveillance methodology and data base system by:&#13;
-      -review the current and proposed laws, regulations and guidelines in&#13;
order to ensure all major areas of risk are well addressed by the&#13;
regulatory framework and amend where necessary. This review will&#13;
be completed under the guidance of the Director, Banking Supervision&#13;
and the IMF Advisor as well as other technical assistance and support&#13;
as required.&#13;
-     co-ordinate the NBAA review results with the full review of the&#13;
existing regulatory reporting system   and amend the financial&#13;
institution reporting requirements as needed.&#13;
-     promote and co-ordinate feedback from the financial institutions and&#13;
the examination and financial analyst staff members regarding the&#13;
NBAA Teview, the regulatory reporting review exercise and the&#13;
proposed changes to the regulatory reporting requirements to obtain&#13;

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR INSURANCE SUPERVISION&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
The Government of Tanzania has undertaken a program of financial reform that is&#13;
to include the establishment of the system of supervision of insurance company operations&#13;
in the country. New legislation was drafted in 1994 and is expected to be passed shortly.&#13;
The authorities have concluded that it is necessary to establish a supervisory system of&#13;
insurance that is capable of supervising companies in Tanzania with the same standards of&#13;
analysis, inspection and control that prevail in the intemational market. Such a system will&#13;
enhance the confidence of the insuring public in Tanzania and will open the door to&#13;
ultimate participation of Tanzanian companies in the insurance markets of other countries.&#13;
In order to carry out this reform process, the Government has requested technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
Having regard for the fact that the insurance industry was, until recently, entirely a&#13;
state-run operation and the fact that private sector participation is still very limited, and&#13;
there is a limited amount of professional insurance expertise available in the country, the&#13;
approach that is proposed is based on independent supervision by government authorities.&#13;
Cooperation and assistance from insurance professionals, as they start to take an active&#13;
part in the insurance community in the country, will be mandatory to the sucessful&#13;
implementation of a supervisory function.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    The overall objective is to establish an effective supervisory system and thereby&#13;
promote confidence in the insurance market. The main components include:&#13;
.  drafting prudential regulations designed to strengthen the ability of the&#13;
regulatory agency to license, regulate and supervise insurance companies&#13;
including (1) establishing prudential controls and limits, such as exposure&#13;
limits, capital adequacy guidelines, and controls on related parties, (2)&#13;
establishing accounting standards and reporting, and (3) enforcing corrective&#13;
measures through legal sanctions and other remedies, with specific guidance on&#13;
dealing with troubled institutions.&#13;
.  developing an implementation plan for the introduction of prudential&#13;
regulations with specific targets and time parameters to ensure that compliance&#13;
is achieved within the phase-in period.&#13;
*  developing a plan for the establishment of the regulatory function, addressing&#13;
staffing and training requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
85                             Annex 7.9&#13;
reviewing and recommending changes to other legislation affecting the&#13;
insurance industry to ensure harmony among the various acts. Such acts&#13;
include but are not limited to the Companies Ordinance Act and the Tax Act.&#13;
2.    The consultant will be required to progressively transfer his/her knowledge, know-&#13;
how, and responsibilities to their local counterparts. The consultant will be deemed&#13;
accountable in this respect, and their performance will be evaluated on, among other&#13;
things, the extent to which such transfer actually takes places.&#13;
3.    The contracts will be renewable annually.&#13;
Outputs to be Prepared&#13;
4.    The major outputs would include:&#13;
i)   Manual of Regulations for insurers in Tanzania&#13;
ii)  Manual of accounting principles, practices and reporting guidelines for&#13;
insurers in Tanzania including the forms to be completed by insurance&#13;
companies when reporting their results.&#13;
iii) Implementation plan for the introduction of the Regulations to the insurance&#13;
industry in Tanzania.&#13;
iv)  Work plan for the establishment of the regulatory function including staffing&#13;
and training requirements.&#13;
v)  Recommended changes to legislation and regulation.&#13;
Skills and Experience Sought&#13;
5.    The consultant needs to have a knowledge of both accounting and insurance&#13;
regulation.  Experience in advising other regulatory agencies will be an assest.&#13;
Participants will also need to indicate how the work of the actuary will be taken into&#13;
account in the development of financial results and in reporting.&#13;

Annex7.10&#13;
TANZANIA&#13;
CREDIT INFORMATION BUREAU&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.   In 1991, the Government of Tanzania began implementation of its financial sector&#13;
reform program. The aim is to move from a concentrated inefficient government-owned&#13;
system to a strong private and competitive financial sector. To support these initiatives&#13;
many programs have been introduced or are underway. These include new banking&#13;
legislation, the establishment of a Capital Markets and Securities Authority to promote the&#13;
development of a stock market (including an OTC), as well as a recovery trust vehicle to&#13;
hold and recover the non-performing portfolios of the government owned banks. As well,&#13;
the major government-owned financial institutions are all cited for varying degrees of&#13;
privatization.  In addition, parastatal reform, which includes privatization, is also&#13;
underway.&#13;
2.    One major reason for the very poor condition of the existing financial market is the&#13;
lack of any formal mechanism to provide independent and reliable information on domestic&#13;
companies, their operations, their management and their credit records. Such a vehicle&#13;
would promote a credit and market discipline which would (1) help prevent a&#13;
reoccurrence of the severe solvency and non-performing loan problems in the system, (2)&#13;
promote the credit education of the market, including both bankers and borrowers alike,&#13;
to the benefits of timely and independently audited financial statements and (3) which, in&#13;
turn, would promote the development of the capital markets and the privatization efforts.&#13;
Objective&#13;
3.    The objective of the assignment is to conduct a feasibility study of the&#13;
establishment of an independent commercially viable credit information bureau in the&#13;
Tanzanian environment, identifying some of the organization and financial parameters for&#13;
its development. This might include the design of possible support mechanisms, as interim&#13;
measures, until such an agency was able to be self-sustaining.&#13;
The Assignment&#13;
4.    The assignment would be carried out in two phases.  Phase one would be&#13;
undertaken over a three month period and would include extensive research, study and&#13;
discussion with the key members of the financial system as well as commercial enterprises&#13;
in Tanzania, as well as major accounting and legal firms to determine whether the market&#13;
is sufficiently developed to support such a credit information bureau. More specifically,&#13;
the assignment would include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
87&#13;
Annex7.10&#13;
a) through discussion and/or questionnaire, survey the readiness of private and&#13;
state-owned companies and financial institutions to participate in such an&#13;
agency on a structured fee basis.&#13;
b) determine the capacity in the market to support such an agency, identifying the&#13;
tiers of players in the market and whether they could realistically be relied on to&#13;
support such an agency.&#13;
c) review with the BOT and major financial and industry members/groups the&#13;
potential ownership/membership structure for an agency. This review would&#13;
also include discussions with existing credit reference agencies in africa and&#13;
elsewhere.&#13;
d) review the legal framework and identify impediments/required changes and&#13;
determine the political will and the legislative implications of these impediments&#13;
and the anticipated time horizon for any projected amendments.&#13;
e) determine whether the establishment of an agency can be cost justified within a&#13;
reasonable time frame (up to three years) and identify potential support&#13;
mechanisms to carry it to sustainability and their cost implications.&#13;
f) outline in fair detail the type of technical and other assistance needed if an&#13;
agency were to be developed, including a component for credit education.&#13;
5.    If the recommendation from the stage one initial study is to proceed with the credit&#13;
agency concept and this recommendation is supported by BOT, the second stage&#13;
review/study would include an eight week detailed review of the undernoted:&#13;
g) a detailed market analysis of the potential market for credit agency services&#13;
h) a recommendation for the development of the agency in terms of the breadth&#13;
and depth of the product and service mix to be offered.&#13;
i) a detailed five year business plan including the recommendation for ownership&#13;
structure.&#13;
j) a detailed technical assistance plan to cover the period to commercial viability.&#13;
k) a detailed education plan for the financial system, including bankers, industry&#13;
and even households.&#13;
1) a total costing regarding projected required financial support over a three to&#13;
five year time horizon.&#13;
m) a detailed plan of action needed to move toward implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
88                            Annex7.10&#13;
Output&#13;
6.    The output for stage one will be a detailed report of the feasibility of the&#13;
establishment of a credit agency and should include a go/no go recommendation. In the&#13;
event the recommendation is to support the credit agency concept, this should include an&#13;
outline of the support mechanisms needed. Phase two would also produce a detailed&#13;
report at its conclusion, incorporating a detailed   plan of action to move to&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Timing&#13;
7.    The initial feasibility study will culminate in a report following a three month study&#13;
period. The BOT will digest the results over the month following the issuance of the&#13;
report, with the decision regarding Phase Two to be taken within that period. Phase two&#13;
will proceed within three months of the completion of Phase One and will be finalized with&#13;
eight weeks of commencement with a final report due at that time.&#13;

TANZANIA CAPITAL MARKETS SECURITIES AUTHORITY&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS&#13;
1     Introduction. '[he impetus for capital market development stems from the financing needs of&#13;
the private sector and the Governnment's objective of broad-based ownership of privatized enterprises.&#13;
The recorded pipeline of private investment projects has grown steadily on the strength of Tanzania's&#13;
economic reform program. Loan applications to the local and external DFIs have grown substantially.&#13;
However, disbursements have been modest partly because of the inability of local investors to satisfy&#13;
the related equity requirements.  The limited supply of medium-term credit and outside equity&#13;
financing is a widely-perceived constraint to the further growth of the private sector.  The&#13;
Government's perception also is that the privatization program has been hampered by the absence of a&#13;
developed capital market which would enable broad participation in the program. The Government has&#13;
retained shares (ranging from 20% to 50%) in many of the parastatals which have been privatized: the&#13;
aim is to divest these shares to the public when appropriate mechanisms for doing so have been&#13;
developed.&#13;
2.     The Government recognizes that a capital market requires certain pre-conditions for its&#13;
successful operation. These include macroeconomic stability, low inflation, public confidence in the&#13;
economic and political environment, a sound banking system, and adequate accounting standards.&#13;
Many of these conditions do not exist in Tanzania, and their attainment will not be quick.&#13;
Consequently, the Government has elected to adopt a gradual approach to the development of capital&#13;
markets. To this end, in January, 1994 the Parliament approved a Capital Markets and Securities Act&#13;
(CMSA) to promote the gradual development of an efficient and fair capital market in Tanzania. The&#13;
Act envisages the creation of an Authority to oversee the securities market. Initially, the focus would&#13;
be on the development of a simple over-the-counter (OTC) dealer market in securities.&#13;
3.    OBJECTIVES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. The objective is to establish a Capital&#13;
Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA) of high professional integrity, regulatory effectiveness&#13;
and operational efficiency. The responsibilities of CMSA would include: 1) coordinating donor&#13;
projects to develop capital markets; 2) licensing investment dealers, advisers and managers, and&#13;
security exchanges; 3) operating the regulatory regime for public offering of securities; and 4)&#13;
overseeing the conduct of the secondary market dealing in the post-issue period.&#13;
4.     The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for coordinating all activities related to&#13;
securities markets development in Tanzania. He/She is responsible for advising the Government to&#13;
enact new legislation and regulations or initiate changes to existing legislation and regulations in&#13;
order to facilitate and regulate the development of the securities industry. The CEO is also&#13;
responsible for the internal management of the CMSA. In the start-up phase, the CEO would have&#13;
overall responsibility for the CMSA's finances and for oversight of the finances of licensed&#13;
securities firms and of other securities service providers regulated by the Authority. He/She would&#13;
also act as a CMSA counterpart to the Bank of Tanzania in the regulation of capital adequacy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
95                                  Annex 7.12&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Government of Tanzania wishes to
            implement a strategy which would address the fundamental
            weaknesses in the financial sector while building the
            foundation for the diversification of financial instruments.
            The main elements of this strategy are: 1) encouraging
            competition in the commercial banking sector; 2)
            strengthening banking regulation and supervision; 3)
            improving the payments mechanism especially in rural areas;
            4) promoting and supporting comprehensive parastatal
            reforms, including privatization, of state owned
            enterprises; 5) developing a market for Government
            securities; 6) establishing a regulatory structure for
            securities and insurance markets; and 7) developing a
            corporate securities market. In this context, the primary
            objectives of the Financial Institutions Development Project
            are to develop a market oriented financial system and to
            ensure the orderly and gradual evolution of capital markets.
            The project will include the following components: 1)
            restructuring and privatization of National Bank of Commerce
            and People's Bank of Zanzibar within an agreed
            timetable; 2) strengthening of Bank of Tanzania's
            Supervision Directorate; 3) developing a mechanism for
            regulating the insurance industry; 4) studies on possible
            improvements to the payments system and the feasibility of a
            private credit information bureau; and 5) technical
            assistance to develop an appropriate mechanism for
            regulating and overseeing the evolution of a capital market.
