&amp;#12;                                         FOREWORD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transeript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World Bank's&#13;
fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur, The World Bank:&#13;
Its First Hal{ Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1997. It is not a formal&#13;
oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the person interviewed. At times&#13;
the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at&#13;
other times they talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview&#13;
tapes and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives&#13;
believes that this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public&#13;
use.&#13;
&amp;#12;Note: The transcript was reconstituted by Christopher Willoughby in Apri/2009 on the&#13;
basis of the original tape, which had very many small gaps, to try to convey the&#13;
substance clearly and accurately without modernization.&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A] 1&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: .. Yes, I think agriculture and rural development have been the&#13;
destination of the largest amount of Bank funding in Bangladesh. However, within that,&#13;
 I would have thought that the issues that have been most difficult and controversial are&#13;
those relating to development of land and water resources, particularly the latter. I think&#13;
the debate started basically with the master plan for the development of the area's water&#13;
resources that had been prepared by IECO [International Engineering Company] of San&#13;
Francisco. My own first involvement with the country happened to have been as a very&#13;
junior member of a brief mission that had gone to Dhaka to discuss that plan in 1965,&#13;
soon after it was completed. The plan proposed very large expenditures, and especially&#13;
on embankments of the main rivers ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Down the Brahmaputra?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Yes, down the Brahmaputra and down the Meghna and also along&#13;
the Ganges. That plan was subjected to study by the Bank and by others. The Bank's&#13;
view was pretty negative.&#13;
&#13;
Then, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, more or less by chance--this was the time when&#13;
Bangladesh was in formation as an independent country--there was a lot of important&#13;
work by Bob [Robert] Picciotto and Bob [Robert] Sadove and others on what would be&#13;
the right approaches to the development of land and water resources. A large report was&#13;
produced. Through the 1970s there was quite a lot of follow-up Bank investment in&#13;
limited flood control and drainage projects. And then--! suppose it was really the early&#13;
1980s--there was a strong take-off, a bit like in Pakistan but five years later, of private&#13;
wells, competing (also as in Pakistan) with earlier-started efforts with public tubewells.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank got on the bandwagon of the private wells and succeeded in convincing the&#13;
government to introduce some liberalization. There was a kind of hiccup to that, and it&#13;
was partly rolled back, but then in the late 1980s-say, from 1987 on--there was really a&#13;
big move in that direction and a lot of liberalization. There is now a great deal of&#13;
confidence in the contribution that can be made, and has been made, by the expansion&#13;
of pretty much unregulated irrigation.&#13;
&#13;
Now we are very heavily involved in the so-called Flood Action Plan effort which&#13;
would be a large investment program with many components. Nobody else is quite&#13;
doing that kind of thing, but many agencies are contributing to the effort. It's almost&#13;
going back to the planning concepts proposed by the Bank's Picciotto, Sadove and&#13;
associates team. Various studies, pilot schemes, and experimental works and projects,&#13;
financed by various external sources, are being undertaken with a view to helping to&#13;
resolve the dilemmas about what kind of works and designs would be best. It would&#13;
certainly be interesting for you to talk with Peter Rogers--still at Harvard, I think--about&#13;
that effort.&#13;

&#13;
                                    Christopher R. Willoughby&#13;
                                 November 18, 1991-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The new Flood Action Plan effort (some 25 studies in all) resulted from international&#13;
interest in follow-up to the big 1988 floods which did a lot of damage across the&#13;
country. Those floods generated much interest and sympathy for Bangladesh. Some&#13;
five or six studies were undertaken by different countries to identifY ways to help the&#13;
country deal with this standing major threat. 'The more extreme studies were one, the&#13;
French, and two, the Chinese, strongly emphasizing the embankment kind of solution.&#13;
At the other extreme was the U.S. study, in which Peter Rogers participated, saying that&#13;
the approach should focus on how to learn to live with the floods and take advantage of&#13;
the way that Bangladeshi farmers were already coping with them since embankments&#13;
would have very major, but often unpredictable, side-effects.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Let me just interrupt you with a question. If I'm not mistaken, Peter Rogers&#13;
and Roger Revel were very much taken with the thought of a canal across Bangladesh&#13;
that would backflow the surge (from the Brahmaputra) up the Ganges and park it in that&#13;
great set of aquifers in the Gangetic Plain. It was obviously a cross-country kind of&#13;
proposition, but I know Revel was very turned on about that in the late 1960s, and I&#13;
think Rogers was the technician.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: I think he was involved.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But that sort of thing hasn't been talked about seriously oflate?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Well, the reason why the Bank also came back in the middle 1960s&#13;
was because it always saw a little hope that it might be able to play a valuable role in&#13;
assisting achievement of an international agreement on water resources, as it had done&#13;
in the West. It is a matter of sadness for the Bank that that has never been activated,&#13;
and the situation really continues to get worse. There's not much publicity about the&#13;
damage being done to Bangladesh by the Farakka Barrage, but it is certainly a sensitive&#13;
issue between the two countries. Even if no! quite as serious as your interlocutors here&#13;
may imply, I believe it is a serious matter. You will probably meet some people who&#13;
will talk about the problem of maintaining adequate flows and groundwater levels in&#13;
southwest Bangladesh. There are various versions of building a large diversion canal&#13;
from the Brahmaputra or Jamuna some way either over into India or within Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: To the Ganges ?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: To the Ganges, yes. But I must admit I've not been very&#13;
significantly involved in any of these things because we've never really gotten&#13;
anywhere on them. There are still continuing, possibly even heightening, relations and&#13;
exchanges on these matters between India and Bangladesh, so it is always possible that&#13;
opportunities may emerge. But at present the protest is that even the agreement that&#13;
they currently have on division of the waters is not being abided by. And a somewhat&#13;
similar problem is arising with the big floods--very serious floods that have just taken&#13;
place--on the eastern tributary of the Brahmaputra.&#13;
&#13;
The f1rst point I had wanted to make is just to underline the very great importance of the&#13;
flood issues and the related geological and topographical factors. Perhaps the most&#13;
distinguishing characteristic of Bangladesh as compared with any other country is that&#13;
it's a very particular piece ofland ..&#13;
&#13;
                             Cltristoplter R. Willoughby&#13;
                          November 18, 1991 -Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Barely land.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Barely land, too, very right. And the flood issue has been rather a&#13;
central focus and extremely controversial. There's an important recent OED&#13;
[Operations Evaluation Department] report by [Robert E.] Burns. Do you know Bob&#13;
Burns?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Bob Burns? I can't ...&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: I think he has been in OED a bit. He's a transport economist--that's&#13;
where I knew him--but he then obviously diversified beyond. He was always&#13;
considered to be a little bit too controversial, but eventually we succeeded in getting&#13;
him to join the World Bank as a staff member, and at some point he must have gone&#13;
over into OED. He wrote a very caustic report about some of what they call flood&#13;
control, especially the drainage and polderization parts of it, because of the many&#13;
problems that have arisen, for instance when the rains come and you can't get the water&#13;
out rapidly.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The Dutch themselves have not been involved very much in this kind of&#13;
thing?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Some people, probably including Peter Rogers, would say that the&#13;
Dutch expertise has been too heavily involved in the sense that the conditions here are&#13;
too different from those in the calm geographical and climatic conditions of Northwest&#13;
Europe.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The Bank in this sense is very interesting. This has been a very central area&#13;
of involvement. Has it come across with a single voice, or is there rather a kind of a&#13;
variety of views that get sort of incorporated within the Bank's thinking and actions?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: I hope it's evolved. I think it should have done so or may yet need&#13;
to go further, since knowledgeable people have emphasized to me that dikes are not a&#13;
bad idea for some parts of Bangladesh. The issues are, however, very complicated and&#13;
difficult. I think that if one studied the matter properly, one would probably find quite a&#13;
bit of evolution in the Bank's thinking in respect of the concept of much greater reliance&#13;
on dikes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Some would say that the pumps have had bad distributional effects, as I&#13;
remember.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: They claim that, yes. In Rangpur in north Bengal I remember&#13;
hearing about a study by a person with a name like Gerald Pale or Peale, which raised&#13;
serious questions about that, and it was probably correct.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There's a book called Quiet Violence.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: A Quiet Violence, yes, that's a good book.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [James K.] Boyce and [Betsy] Hartman. That had a chapter on this.&#13;
&#13;
                             Christopher R. Willoughby&#13;
                          November 18, 1991- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
\\1LLOUGHBY: I did read the book, and 1 think I know the person who wrote it, but&#13;
1 don't remember it dealing so systematically with the effects of pumps on income&#13;
distribution. But it is very likely that there have been some bad distributional effects.&#13;
There was also a great deal of inefficiency about it, inefficient use of such a large&#13;
volume of water in bringing large amounts of land under irrigation. And also there was&#13;
a lot of inefficiency from the whole public-sector side of it, reflecting the common&#13;
theme of public-sector inefficiency in Bangladesh throughout the period.&#13;
&#13;
Probably the strongest attack on the Bank at the present time from within Bangladesh is&#13;
in connection with agriculture and rural development. Since you are certainly interested&#13;
in the effectiveness of Bank and donor work in poverty reduction, as well as agricultural&#13;
production, I would urge you to meet with my much more knowledgeable colleague,&#13;
Frank Thornley. For the last five years he has been the head of agriculture in our office&#13;
here, and he also worked with Bangladesh from Washington for about five years in the&#13;
earlier 1980s, so he knows about all of this that l'vejust been trying to summarize. 1&#13;
believe he's also a very balanced interpreter of the realities.&#13;
&#13;
LE\\1S: Have there been any employment programs with direct effects on poverty?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: That brings us directly to the confrontation that there has been in a&#13;
sense with Muhammad Yunus. I don't have much confrontation with Yunus; he's still a&#13;
good friend of mine. But there is a sad story of[Attila] Karaosmanoglu's negative view&#13;
ofYunus on this particular issue.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has been trying, apparently since 1982, to start a program in&#13;
employment generation, such as Grameen [Bank] and many NGOs [non-government&#13;
organizations]like BRAC [Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee], Proshika,&#13;
Swanirvar and others have been trying to develop. The Bank went through a great&#13;
variety of possible solutions and made some progress but then slipped back again and&#13;
then felt finally, about 1988, that they were getting somewhere. I believe that&#13;
Muhammad Yunus contributed advice at various times in this long process.&#13;
&#13;
 When I turned up here a year and a half ago, the Bank and the government were about&#13;
to float an employment foundation. It was to be fed with IDA [International&#13;
Development Association] money essentially, and it was going to do two things. It was&#13;
going to make credit available to support either NGO or government programs of credit&#13;
for self-employment generation, and it was going to put money also into institutional&#13;
development and training to expand capacities for carrying out such programs. So it was&#13;
to make large contributions to meeting very high-priority needs. Besides Grameen and&#13;
other NGOs, there are also some good government programs underway. There is a&#13;
variety of government departments which somewhere in their lower levels have good&#13;
programs, as in the Ministry of Youth, and one in the Ministry of Social Welfare, for&#13;
example. The foundation, which was to be a private, non-governmental body and still&#13;
to get government money but to be very autonomous in its decisions, was intended to&#13;
receive applications from government bodies and non-government bodies alike, study&#13;
them, and on-lend or give support to proposals that seemed sound. This was the essence&#13;
of the idea, which was very novel for the Bank at the time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Where did that originate, that idea? Here in this office or ...&#13;
&#13;
                              Christopher R. Willoughby&#13;
                          November 18, 1991- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: No, I think probably it was the product of the work of Martin&#13;
Karcher and his small team in the South Asia Regional Office in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yeah. We've talked to him.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Very good man, and under him was a chap who had, I think,&#13;
worked on this thing all through these eight or so years, and he had interacted with a lot&#13;
of people here. So it was that kind of process.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, to come back to my little history of recent development, in the week when I&#13;
came on the scene towards the middle of 1990, the project was just about ready to move&#13;
to finalization. Within a week or two there came the question of a delegation going to&#13;
Washington to negotiate terms so as to get the commitment in that fiscal year's lending&#13;
program. And I became aware that there were certain problems, because Syeduzzaman,&#13;
who was the chairman of the foundation, was indicating that other factors were&#13;
intervening. 1 had also already been in touch a bit with Muhammad Yunus.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So the foundation had already been created as a middleman ...&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Finally been created, yes. Mr. [Hussein M.] Ershad had held it up&#13;
for a year or something, but the government had finally stomached the idea of having a&#13;
foundation which would be autonomous, more or less private, and could make&#13;
government suffer the possible indignity of having its proposals go along with the NGO&#13;
proposals, and, you know, all the government ones turned down for being not much&#13;
good while the NGO ones got approval. I thought it was quite courageous on the part of&#13;
the government to accept that the bureaucracy would be obliged to compete in this way.&#13;
So it was interesting from that point of view too.&#13;
&#13;
However, Yunus had been expressing to me in our conversations some worry. He was&#13;
important because he was a member of the foundation's board. At one point they had&#13;
had a meeting going over the World Bank yellow-cover report and, in a sense, also&#13;
building up support for the concept that Bangladesh could handle the program itself&#13;
without need for World Bank support. And 1 was told more or less the same thing by&#13;
the government's External Relations ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The planning commission?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: More specifically, the ERD [Economic Relations Division] that is&#13;
now under the Finance Ministry and responsible for all relations with donors, similar to&#13;
the set-up in Delhi.&#13;
&#13;
It's important to add to the record, too, that [Moeen A.] Qureshi had been working on&#13;
the expectation of having this project tor eight years or something and was taking the&#13;
position "Now, either you get it in this fiscal year or please cut it. The process is too&#13;
inefficient." I knew that Enam Ahmed Chaudhury, ERD Secretary, was very much&#13;
pressing that the negotiations should take place and it was a person from the foundation,&#13;
a deputed government employee, who was going to do the negotiating. And I knew that&#13;
the newly created board had had some doubts. But I was still somewhat surprised to&#13;
learn that the negotiations in Washington had simply failed.&#13;
&#13;
                             Christopher R. Willoughby&#13;
                          November 18, 1991 -Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The thing that really annoys Mr. Karaosmanoglu is that Yunus allegedly mobilized his&#13;
friends in the Washington community to go and see Mr. [Barber B.] Conable and&#13;
complain about the Bank forcing a loan down Bangladesh's throat and so on. And&#13;
whether Yunus was right or not, it was certainly sad since this was the one thing that&#13;
would have got us involved directly in something very important in connection with&#13;
poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Were environmental NGOs.going to be able to participate? They have&#13;
become rather important in India and have contributed valuably to debate and&#13;
alternatives.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: We don't have here yet--we were just talking of that a day or two&#13;
ago--such strong local environmental NGOs. In fact, we'd rather like to have some&#13;
more environmentally interested NGOs. You can find a lot of environmental criticism&#13;
coming up and the country is full of environmental problems, but the environmentally&#13;
oriented NGOs are much stronger in India.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's a fascinating story and tragic beeause you can see how every party was&#13;
really sort of playing in its own mind a kind of positive and constructive role, and the&#13;
damned thing just--you had a clash of, a sort of intersection, instead of convergence,&#13;
confrontation.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Anyway, as I remember Yunus saying in one of the conversations I&#13;
had with him at the time though I did not know then that he had won the argument at the&#13;
foundation's board, "Look," he said, "the World Bank has made a tremendous&#13;
contribution. It has got this foundation started. Without IDA we would never have had&#13;
that foundation approved by Ershad. and that's a very great accomplishment, you know.&#13;
Just be content with that. You've made your contribution. You don't need to make a&#13;
loan, too." That was his line and, indeed, the outcome.&#13;
&#13;
As I say, this remains a very important area, and the foundation was created and it had&#13;
an appropriation from government. It got going quite quickly and it's been working&#13;
pretty effectively, probably not far off the seale that had been projected in the World&#13;
Bank's report since the Bank had incorporated a very slow buiJd,up in its projections, in&#13;
response to Yunus' fear that the World Bank always comes in with supervisors who&#13;
think they know better--you know, "Why are you not picking up or keeping up on the&#13;
disbursements?"--the heavy pressure that he doesn't like. Maybe he had had some bad&#13;
particular experience with ourselves or some of our colleagues at some earlier period.&#13;
&#13;
But the thing is that it is going. But it's only now getting into the question of well,&#13;
maybe it's not quite enough to be doing lending. Maybe we ought really to have a kind&#13;
of another branch which does promotion of new NGOs in the difficult areas that are not&#13;
served by any of the existing ones. That was the main thrust of the World Bank's&#13;
proposal. I remember a conversation I had with Syeduzzaman a few months ago, where&#13;
he said, "Ah, but you know, if we're going to get into promotion, then we're going to&#13;
get into a real conflict of interest situation because if we have promoted a particular&#13;
kind ofNGO initiative or fund, then we're going to feel obliged to lend to that fund and&#13;
that's going to affect our bankers' judgment on the case." So you have a great mixture&#13;
of quite conservative, cautious philosophy with Yunus' more radical approach, and they&#13;
&#13;
                             Christopher R. Willoughby&#13;
                          November 18, 1991 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          7&#13;
&#13;
seem to come together in consensus to move rather slowly, so that progress is slow&#13;
compared with need.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, it's very difficult. I'm still trying to understand better how to make progress&#13;
on this question, and we still keep in touch with the ongoing project, financed entirely&#13;
from the government budget, and regional initiatives. There must be something that we&#13;
could do to help break this particular bottleneck. Maybe we will do another project,&#13;
another approach.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is it this experience with Attila that really killed it in the Bank? You couldn't&#13;
go again with this kind of a project, are you sure of that?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: No, I don't think so, between Attila on the one hand--though of&#13;
course he is now ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Still in the picture, up above.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Yes, but he's supposed to be definitely not responsible for India.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: But I think that the bigger obstacle would probably still be with&#13;
Yunus. It would be, I mean it could be, actually quite compatible with his original&#13;
statement that, "Look, you must let us start on our own. We've got to build up our own&#13;
things, work out our own solutions. We don't want this on a non-national basis."&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So he does genuinely believe that?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Oh, yes. You're very correct when you said that everybody was&#13;
trying to do their best and contribute in the best possible way. So, I mean, it would still&#13;
be possible, but to make small loans.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I don't understand how the board got chosen.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: I don't quite know myself because it was before my time, but it&#13;
must have been the government of Bangladesh picking out some names. I'm guite sure&#13;
that the World Bank was keen that Yunus be on that board because he had given so&#13;
much to the concept and the ideas, and he could obviously contribute a lot, too, in terms&#13;
of substance. The problem is perhaps more one of personality. Everything that Yunus&#13;
says about Grameen is pretty much true. Of course they've had some minor problems&#13;
recently, but the basic formula has been taken up in other similar programs such as&#13;
BRAC and various government programs, but they're still only serving at best 25&#13;
percent of the existing beneficiaries of such programs across the country as a whole.&#13;
Yunus is a bit arrogant, but he probably has to be so in order to have accomplished all&#13;
that he has, and he has the achievement to justify it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Were you the only funders?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Well, our money has never gone into it, in the end, you see ...&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Wasn't there IDA?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: No, there would have been IDA had that loan--had the government&#13;
taken that loan, which wasn't very big, about 4 million.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: If the government took a loan from IDA and put it in a foundation, the Bank&#13;
wouldn't own the foundation.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But obviously it creates some degree of influence.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They might not have very much at alL I mean, it depends on what sort of a&#13;
body emerges and how it is handled.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No, but I am thinking in slightly more extreme terms. If a group of people&#13;
have set up this foundation to do something which is fine but which is going to do one&#13;
percent ofthe job that the government and the Bank perceive needs to be done, I don 'I&#13;
think the Bank should feel inhibited about going and looking for another route,&#13;
particularly if the government is also interested in pushing along with some more&#13;
energetic initiative. I guess what I'm trying to get at is the suggestion that the Bank&#13;
might have pushed harder in this case. Is this more or less the situation? I mean,&#13;
there's no legal issue?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: No, no legal obstacle. But maybe we're looking at the matter from&#13;
too short a time perspective to draw any very firm conclusion. We're still trying to find&#13;
the solution, but it just means that that's now about ten years of search for the solution,&#13;
a solution as to how IDA could contribute to this particular thing,&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I should think, in personalities, that here you have an institutional culture that&#13;
you're trying to break into, the NGO group and a whole set of things of this sort, and&#13;
you're trying to get aboard and give momentum to that, and if you get into a position&#13;
where you're doing it over their dead bodies, that isn't what you had in mind to set up.&#13;
I don't think you could set up ...&#13;
&#13;
Â·wEBB: No, but it's only one or two, I mean, it's one layer here, and they're trying to&#13;
serve another layer, and what you've done is you've created a monopoly. You've&#13;
created a financial intermediary ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It isn't all Yunus.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: .. and you could practice what you preach, apply financial liberalization and&#13;
then ...&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: One of the ideas we talked about, I remember, in the office here,&#13;
was: "Well, that's fine to have the foundation here established in Dhaka. But why&#13;
don't we think also of getting some regional foundations, more along our ideas, one in&#13;
Rajshahi, for instance, and one in Sylhet?" But there is always also the element that&#13;
John is referring to, and that argues quite strongly for going a little slower, building up&#13;
local capacity and initiative. The question goes broader too. Bangladesh is a rather&#13;
particular country also in the sense that people can see, more or less, what could be done&#13;
in the next 15 to 20 years, but it is rather unclear whether for the longer term enough&#13;
&#13;
                             Christopher R. Willoughby&#13;
                          November 18, 1991- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
could be done to avoid disaster of one sort or another. We are really the most populous&#13;
country in the world, and the population is very, very dense.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is there production of natural gas?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Not yet, but there is a very controversial project sometimes&#13;
discussed for export of gas to India. Largely for political reasons, real prospects in that&#13;
direction are probably small. What you can see in terms of domestic use would be at&#13;
the export processing zone at Chittagong, which is limited at present to some 40&#13;
enterprises and should be able to be greatly expanded there, and elsewhere, too. If that&#13;
line of economic growth is not really strongly developed, it really is a bit hard to avoid&#13;
foreseeing either a major disaster of some sort or, more likely, a real deterioration in the&#13;
water situation which would make it hard to avoid the kind of inter-racial tensions&#13;
already rising in Sri Lanka.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You might almost say that training and education are very labor-intensive&#13;
activities. Is there any thought that you can export trained people a lot more?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Yes, certainly. This industry is, as people say, already the biggest&#13;
foreign exchange earner in the country's history, and a continuing growth center.&#13;
'Ihere's much interest in expanding that, and there seems to be more and more&#13;
indications that it can become important within Asia.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Singapore is talking about importing people, and Taiwan is talking&#13;
about importing Bangladeshis.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: This discussion reminds me rather of the experience of the Bank in the 1970s&#13;
and especially the failure of so many of the integrated rural development projects in&#13;
Africa. The arguments for a crash effort then stressed pushing ahead with the best&#13;
approach we had, even though not yet fully proven as a successful formula, because of&#13;
the scale of the problems foreseeable in the future. Isn't this debate now more or less a&#13;
re-run of that earlier one?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Well, what I said just now about time being short and Bangladesh&#13;
having to do something may be the same as what some people felt earlier about Africa,&#13;
but I'm not talking about the same kinds of solutions. I don't think that Bangladesh has&#13;
had at all so much of the integrated rural development types of projects as were&#13;
developed in Africa. From a broader point of view, however, the dilemma you raise&#13;
may well apply: how do you plan and organize projects which seem to be responsive to&#13;
the reality of the situation that a country faces and which are yet compatible with the&#13;
organizational and administrative capacity of the country? Yunus was in a way taking&#13;
quite a specific stand on that very dilemma, making sure of effectiveness in the&#13;
Bangladeshi reality before embarking on a rapid expansion.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Let me jump in here. I think, at least for us-but it's really taking your time--&#13;
it's useful to try to get a straight fix on this very interesting story. I would argue that the&#13;
Karcher scheme is not all Iike IRD in Africa ..&#13;

&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Oh, certainly not, no.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: .. which was in a sense trying to do every damned thing at the retail level,&#13;
and hope that it would all come together. The beautiful thing about this project is--1 like&#13;
it so much because I've been, kind of on the back of an envelope, wondering about the&#13;
same sort of thing for years, and we are just now putting out something from ODC&#13;
[Overseas Development Council] called "the Sustainable Development Fund" for the&#13;
U.S. It makes AID [U.S. Agency for International Development] furious because it's&#13;
the same set of ideas, namely that you create a resource, a fund, a drawing account in a&#13;
sense, and then let different people compete for it. And it's enough to give an Ernie&#13;
[Ernest] Stern or a [RobertS.] McNamara fits because you don't draw it down at any&#13;
proven rate. It may not pull the money very fast, but you provide a backlog there that&#13;
can then motivate people to--and take away some of the risks of new starts and so on.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I think it could be achieved in this case with the Bank becoming a wholesaler&#13;
of funds, but the purpose is certainly different this time round.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, well, I think it is in the sense that I'm not sure that ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The purpose is different.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The purpose is quite different, but it is a way of getting from wholesaling to&#13;
retailing but leaving the choices to the recipient.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: We've tried to have the same. We've promoted the idea--l can't say&#13;
that it's got very far--of using the same kind of approach on certain other things, even&#13;
like rural infrastructure or rural water supply and sanitation: have a fund, and let&#13;
enterprising local leaders come up with their proposals and get money out of the fund,&#13;
so as to provide a real stimulus to people to pull themselves together and ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's right. Yeah. And facilitate responsible decision making without&#13;
prejudgment of what things they should go for. But they're probably better judges. But&#13;
I think where Yunus comes in is more emotional, almost. If he takes big money from&#13;
the Bank, he gets a somehow big overhang of Bank presence and interest, an over-the-&#13;
shoulder kind of thing, and he's allergic to anything like that.&#13;
&#13;
We had this experience in the '60s in Delhi of negotiating a so-called Indo-American&#13;
Foundation. And when Indira Gandhi visited the White House, LBJ [Lyndon B.&#13;
Johnson] gave a speech and gave it to her as a gift, and she cheerfully aecepted the&#13;
thing, millions and millions of rupees, which were going to be sort of gently&#13;
administered. Pretty hannless. And then back in Delhi, just like Yunus, K. N. Raj&#13;
stirred up a ginger group at New Delhi University and absolutely bashed the thing, so&#13;
much so that in the end they had to withdraw. It's that kind of sentiment, I think, that&#13;
inspired him not to accept.&#13;
&#13;
KAPGR: Has the Bank done any financing of jute production and improvement?&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: We have tried. I'm not sure whether we've made a loan in the last&#13;
few years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             Christopher R. Willoughby&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        II&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But the Bank has never tried to get itself involved in upgrading the most&#13;
stagnant technologies, even though such support might enable natural-fiber products,&#13;
for example, with strong environmental advantages, to respond more effectively to&#13;
rapidly growing demand for products with such characteristics.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: The Bank has certainly not normally done much of that. I&#13;
remember I had a visit just a few months back: "Wouldn't the World Bank like to make&#13;
an effort to prevail upon the jute minister and support a new initiative?" I think you're&#13;
right. We have not done much, but there has been some thinking about what we could&#13;
do to promote more appropriate technologies.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well done!&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: But let's see what it takes to have any useful effects.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Look at the numbers, and recognize the country's loss ofleadership in the&#13;
environmental field. So it's pretty important to identify what is needed to be effective.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: At least a bit more effort and priority, I am sure.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's really a very seriousÂ·situation. And it's a huge country. The donors don't&#13;
just suggest the plan, they actually decide directly. They seem to focus on achieving&#13;
agreement among themselves, much more I would say, than on getting consensus within&#13;
the country. Obviously you can'tjust decide. People will not agree to work in that&#13;
context. It must be a very sensitive job, keeping everyone on board. How do you&#13;
manage the externals, since it's not just the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A)&#13;
[After loss of at least some minutes of conversation, Begin Tape 1, Side B)&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: I was always a bit surprised that Just Faaland would be the Bank's&#13;
resident representative at all. I'm told that he became the res rep because the&#13;
government of Bangladesh put his name forward in a conversation with McNamara at&#13;
the time the Bank was struggling to establish a relationship with the new country. The&#13;
Bank had decided that it had better have a representative on the ground and an office&#13;
had in fact been opened, but it was not activated at all or they had withdrawn any&#13;
foreign staff during the liberation war.&#13;
&#13;
Then GOB [Government of Bangladesh) said, "Well, why don't you appoint Mr. Just&#13;
Faa land?"&#13;
&#13;
And McNamara said, "Okay, sounds a good man. I don't know anything about him, but&#13;
   "&#13;
&#13;
And that was how he became ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They'd known Just in Pakistan, when he was with the Ford [Foundation]&#13;
group.&#13;

                          November 18, 1991- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
thiS                  I tnmk he did very well, actually, and it's              to a very&#13;
important report, which I could have mentioned in the little history I tried to give of the&#13;
agricultural and water-resource lending development. It was done about 1987 or 1988,&#13;
financed by UNDP [United Nations Development Program}, and really did help to carry&#13;
the government through a critically important stage of thinking towards the&#13;
liberalization approach to agriculture. It's still referred to as being both very valid and&#13;
very much his report.&#13;
&#13;
I don't feel that the World Bank has quite the degree of responsibility here that it has in&#13;
African countries. In African countries I have always been much more frightened about&#13;
the great power and influence, and hence responsibilities, of the World Bank, that result&#13;
simply from the real scarcity of people on the other side to tell the World Bank to shut&#13;
up or that it hasn't done its work. There is a reasonable abundance of critics in Dhaka,&#13;
and the government is quite difficult to negotiate with. It's not a pushover at all.&#13;
Maybe it does not defend its interests as well as what Mexico does. You know,&#13;
something gets decided, but then it gets undecided. Some other fellow comes into the&#13;
picture, and any reforms that take place seem, more frequently than in other countries,&#13;
to get partially rolled back. Much Jess reform than expected is ever really made because&#13;
the parties will come back again and again, and try to get the thing modified or rolled&#13;
back.&#13;
&#13;
It arises in particular with the question of fertilizer liberalization. Until about four years&#13;
ago this was a monopoly of the public sector, under an outfit called BADC [Bangladesh&#13;
Agricultural Development Corporation}. The distribution was agreed to be liberalized--&#13;
under the influence and advice of the donors, but not merely by arbitrary conditionality&#13;
or threats to suspend financing. The emphasis would be more on action that was in tune&#13;
with the general consensus among commentators in the country that, yes, that is the best&#13;
way to move. These interactions among the many stakeholders and the donors play a&#13;
big part in stimulating discussion and reflection, supporting experimentation, pushing&#13;
modernization and spreading a degree of inspiration. Conditionality is very, very&#13;
important here, and very prominent. But there are also lots of funny things said about&#13;
conditionality. Of course we have probably the world's greatest intellectual contestant&#13;
of the international agencies' conditionality in the person of Rehman Sobhan, who has&#13;
written books about the subject.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Who's that?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Rehman Sobhan.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Dr. Sobhan, Dr. Rehman Sobhan, who, unfortunately, you are going&#13;
to see only just before you leave ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's right.&#13;

                           November 18, 1991- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 WILLOUGHBY: .. because he's also leaving on the same day, and he's terribly tied&#13;
 up the next couple of days. But he's a wonderful man, very interesting to talk with. He&#13;
 has written various papers and several books about dependency and dependency theory,&#13;
 and the excessive powers of the aid donors and so on. He was also a very important&#13;
 member of the planning commission of the newly founded Bangladesh in 1971. He&#13;
 would have been the man who had much to do with arrangements to try to substitute for&#13;
 the Pakistani businessmen who left or to encourage continuation of the enterprises&#13;
 which had been operational in both wings of the initial Pakistani state. Rehman is very&#13;
 well known for having a lot of troubles with conditionality. And then he was again&#13;
 himself very much involved in government recently, as a member of the interim&#13;
 government set up following the fall of General Ershad's government in December&#13;
 1990. That interim operation was a very well organized piece of government, led by the&#13;
 country's chief justice. The chief justice had various advisers, who had a lot to do with&#13;
 him and who were really like Ministers. Thus Rehman was not just a well-known&#13;
 intellectual and a friend, but also the person with overall responsibility for running&#13;
 things. He also became very much more familiar with the World Bank activities in the&#13;
 country, the other donors' operations, and especially with the conditionality that we are&#13;
 really trying to be currently very insistent about, to do with the financial sector reforms&#13;
 and to ...&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: Conditionality in agriculture?&#13;
&#13;
  WILLOUGHBY: Not only in agriculture, yes. The cumulative loan recovery rate in&#13;
Â· agriculture as oftoday is supposed to be 20 percent, and with industry it's also only&#13;
  about 20 percent. But I mean we really are trying to be very tough on that.&#13;
&#13;
 And Rehman would say, "Oh well, yes. I mean, on that one, yes, I think we need all the&#13;
 help that you can give. You should be very tough on that."&#13;
&#13;
And then I say, "Well, you know, Rehman, now what about this electric power&#13;
problem? I mean, that's the other one we're having a lot of difficulty with. You spend&#13;
the funds allotted by the Bank and the donors, but no progress is made towards finanCial&#13;
viability, and the basic reason is administrative losses, a polite phrase for referring to&#13;
the half of total sales which yield no revenue to the power company because they are&#13;
either not paid for by the consumer or the agent pockets the funds. And the Bank and&#13;
the donors have finally begun to try to take a tougher stand, with an agreed stance of no&#13;
further lending until reform measures are really on track to get results."&#13;
&#13;
And there again he said, you know, ''!agree to that."&#13;
&#13;
He is certainly a very brilliant, very interesting, very stimulating exponent and&#13;
questioner of things, but I must worry nowadays because I mean it's not only these&#13;
cases. There were others, too. And when you really kind of pin him down and say,&#13;
"Let's look at this particular thing," then he doesn't seem to have quite so ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And he can send you packing. I remember one day he just cut me limb from&#13;
limb when I gave a seminar at the IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development]. He is a terrifically skilled debater. He's a fascinating character.&#13;
&#13;

                              Christopher R. Willoughby&#13;
                           November 18, 1991- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           14&#13;
&#13;
 WILLOUGHBY: I know I am kind of beating around the bush. I am not sure whether&#13;
 I am really answering your questions about donors' influence and aid conditionality.&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: Could I ask something about this? I mean, another way to look at the situation&#13;
 here could be that they're on the cusp of conditionality and, with so much money, the&#13;
 Bank and the donors should have turned tough even sooner. Maybe they haven't been&#13;
 helping things?&#13;
&#13;
 WILLOUGHBY: The Bank's OED has also been quite reproachful of the&#13;
 ineffectiveness of the main conditionality. There was a whole series of what they called&#13;
 import program credits, I think, that was sustained here much longer, if I remember&#13;
 right, than what it was in India. I think it was turned off in India quite rapidly. But the&#13;
 Bank tried over the years to move gradually towards what became structural adjustment&#13;
 lending and so on, to be the main instrument for carrying major reform conditionalities.&#13;
 And they could have moved faster, according to OED, in this direction here. In fact, in&#13;
 terms of the provisional thinking about agriculture, the Bank's efforts did play quite a&#13;
 part in shaping the reforms which have been gradually implemented and which have&#13;
 shown such promising results.&#13;
&#13;
  Has the Bank been excessively committed to just lending and meeting its commitment&#13;
  projections? In the short period I have been involved, we have been trying to give&#13;
  strong support to the return to democracy, to help the new government take off, and to&#13;
  support the finance minister who has always taken the view that the World Bank should&#13;
  be strict about its conditionality. His position is that the Bank can help Bangladesh&#13;
  more by getting some of these reforms made, even if it takes two years of not disbursing&#13;
. more for the electric power sector to bring about change. It really is very fundamental&#13;
  to the building of a successful economy. We don't feel now that we're bound at all by&#13;
  those lending targets, and in fact the more striking characteristic of Bangladesh for the&#13;
  past good number of years is that the Bank and the other donors have not been able to&#13;
  commit what they pledged in the annual Paris meetings because of these difficulties.&#13;
&#13;
 So my line with my Bangladeshi contacts is to point out that Bangladesh is just losing&#13;
 out at every level on aid. The countries don't pledge what the electorates would be&#13;
 prepared to pledge for a country of Bangladesh's enormity of problems, both the degree&#13;
 of poverty and the difficult physical situation in which it finds itself. And then there are&#13;
 shortfalls from pledges in actual commitments, and again from commitments in what is&#13;
 actually disbursed. And then at the end, particularly with our credits, there are often&#13;
 large write-offs in the form of loan cancellations.&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: Perhaps it's changed over time, and the Bank is now getting tough. What if&#13;
 we think more about the situation ten or fifteen years ago?&#13;
&#13;
 WILLOUGHBY: Yes, I should think that's probably true, at least by comparison with&#13;
 the liberation period and just after the liberation, '73, '74, '75. What people say is that&#13;
 there was then a lot of money. Everybody was really trying to just help them start off&#13;
 the new nation.&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: May I ask you a sort ofleading question? Couldn't one say that if the Bank&#13;
 has appeared to be kind of soft on Bangladesh, there really has been a whole set of&#13;
 reasons for it? One is that it is just damned poor, so that you don't have much margin to&#13;
&#13;
                               Christopher R. Willoughby&#13;
                            November 18, 1991- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         15&#13;
&#13;
turn off flows that begin to have impacts. Then you have had this whole set of natural&#13;
shocks: when you're so poor and you then get hit by floods and cyclones and so on, it&#13;
gives you a really keen awareness of misery. And pressures come even from publics in&#13;
donor countries of various kinds. And then you've had an almost constant political&#13;
turbulence so that it's very hard to hold a regime accountable. They keep turning over,&#13;
so that you don't know where the new one's going. And finally in Bangladesh, maybe&#13;
for the first time in a big country, from the very beginning the Bank has been the&#13;
residual donor. It used to be in, say, India and Pakistan that U.S. AID would sort of put&#13;
the thing together, and the Bank could play a selective and somewhat more professional&#13;
role in doing the things that it did rather well, but here you really are sort of holding,&#13;
trying to hold the scene together as far as the donors are concerned.&#13;
&#13;
All of these things, I think, may tend to make the Bank look a little soft in the way it&#13;
handles the country. Too much softness can certainly be terribly counterproductive, as&#13;
you've been saying, in terms of moving in the right kinds of disciplines and&#13;
performance. But, as l think about it, I have a hard job faulting the institution, in a&#13;
sense, for too much softness.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's really a hard judgment.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Very hard judgment.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Who knows? It has come up with a democratic government, and the country&#13;
has survived. Maybe the Bank's position has made that possible.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Might be.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: I don't think I would fault if that much for being too soft or too&#13;
hard. I would fault it more for, you know, some of the projects that were not very good&#13;
and not very well prepared. And I would fault it, perhaps, for some of the kind of&#13;
sectoral patterns.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, it's always very easy to talk in hindsight, but it does seem to me that we&#13;
should have been doing much more over a longer period on primary education. We&#13;
really only got into primary education, as I understand it, in this country in 1980 or '81,&#13;
and yet one would think that it would have been quite possible to act sooner within the&#13;
country's first decade. Now we've had all these studies showing that primary education&#13;
is absolutely crucial and yet the census results that have just come out show an overall&#13;
adult literacy rate of25%, which is even much below what all the Bank's indicators and&#13;
so on were saying for a few years ago. I don't know what they were based on. We&#13;
were believing that the overall literacy rate was much higher. We now have a big&#13;
program in primary education that we are trying to push as top priority. If also helps in&#13;
family planning which has been such an important matter for the country. But there&#13;
should have been more emphasis by our Bank on primary education especially. We got&#13;
messed up with a whole lot of rather ill-prepared and unsuccessful technical education&#13;
projects designed to fit with the Bank's original identification (in the 1960s) of what&#13;
could be productive projects, justifYing loan financing, in the education field.&#13;
&#13;
But it is worrying, John, to recognize not only the lack of improvement in some areas&#13;
over the twenty years, but also the areas of actual deterioration. I was prompted to think&#13;
&#13;
                              Christopher R. Willoughby&#13;
                           November 18, 1991- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            16&#13;
&#13;
about this a bit recently in the context of a program the BBC wanted to do for the&#13;
anniversary ofthe creation of Bangladesh. There are several major things which have&#13;
just deteriorated since 1971. One is the banking system. Another is the university&#13;
system. A third, clearly, is pollution. And then there's the problem of indiscipline and&#13;
corruption which weaken performance and improvement in so many areas.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: One of the great puzzles for the Bank is what you can do about those kinds of&#13;
things?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The Bank has never given a loan to a country for the kind of massive training&#13;
efforts needed to spread more discipline and honesty in public service and&#13;
administration. What do you think about the possibilities? By failing to address this&#13;
debilitating weakness in almost all the activities supported, the donors are adding&#13;
substantially to transaction costs of their programs.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: I think it's part of the good governance emphasis which I always&#13;
feel that, by and large, bilateral donors can do a lot more on than what we can. To work&#13;
effectively with a police force, for instance, it's very useful to have a lot of experience&#13;
yourself in running a police force, and to have a big police establishment that you can&#13;
call on to give advice and lend personneL The British and the Americans are quite&#13;
involved and could be more so, and they pursue too some of the other elements of good&#13;
governance. We can contribute to the good governance effort through helping the&#13;
institutions with which we are involved to manage things in ways more compatible with&#13;
democratic mecha~isms and responsive to the concerns ofthe population. There is no&#13;
very scienti fie solution to good governance. Many people have strong views about&#13;
what makes good government. Okay, let them come and convey directly their views.&#13;
One thing that we have talked about possibly being suitable for Bank involvement is&#13;
work to help build judicial institutions, procedures and systems. We've also never&#13;
really made a loan for that, but we have talked here about it. I'm not sure that the&#13;
problem is particularly lack of training. It goes quite a bit deeper, I think.&#13;
&#13;
But let us recognize, too, that there are still lots of good things to point to from the past&#13;
20 years. I mean, agriculture has basically been a tremendous success. Cereals&#13;
production has doubled over that same 20 years. There has been a certain amount of&#13;
advance in some of the social sectors. Women's literacy is certainly greater now than&#13;
what it was in 1971. There was tremendous advance in various fields, including health&#13;
and some in housing. The trouble is that they're all just kind of small spots, you know,&#13;
little things and so on, and none of it's really showing up at the macro level.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Macro hasn't done so badly in Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
WILI&gt;OUGHBY: Compared with Africa, no, but compared with ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Or Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: Oh, well, Latin America, yes. Sorry. But take Peru, for instance. J&#13;
think it has achieved a significantly higher increase in per capita income over the last&#13;
twenty years, compared with Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Christopher R. Willoughby&#13;
                           November 18, 1991- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Given that we've had a relatively stable kind of government--and in terms of managing&#13;
the macro-economy, quite a solid kind of government--we should have gained more&#13;
improvement in income and welfare. And we are surrounded by countries like Thailand&#13;
and those to the east, plus India and Pakistan, which have both made quite a lot of&#13;
progress, especially Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But if you talk to people from Pakistan, even from India, there's a&#13;
widespread feeling that the impressive rates of GNP growth have tended to go with a&#13;
decline in moral fiber, raising a lot of fear that growth may have come at the cost of the&#13;
future.&#13;
&#13;
WILLOUGHBY: I see. Okay. But at least you've had the growth. If you've lost the&#13;
moral fiber and you've not had the growth, then it's worse. I know I am&#13;
oversimplifying, but in Pakistan and even in India you did not have the extensive&#13;
deterioration ofthe banking system.&#13;
&#13;
I mean, Jochen Kraske was here the other day, and he was getting really quite horrified&#13;
about this agricultural credit situation, particularly because there was a new loan&#13;
envisaged. And he said "What are you even thinking of? With a 12 percent recovery&#13;
rate?" In India the Bank has made more than a billion and a half, or something, ofloans&#13;
to the NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development], but the&#13;
program was cut off when the recovery rate got down to 60 percent. Here, as I&#13;
mentioned earlier, the recovery rate was believed to have deteriorated to 20 percent but&#13;
the latest audit showed it at 12 percent.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In November 1991, Christopher R.
            Willoughby was interviewed by the Brookings Institution on
            behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral history program
            by John Lewis, Richard Webb, and Devesh Kapur. During his
            tenure at the Bank from 1963 to 2000, Mr. Willoughby worked
            in the following areas: in the programming and budgeting
            department as an economist and senior programming officer
            (1963-1970); in the operations evaluation department as a
            chief of finance (1971-1973) and as director (1973-1976); in
            the transportation department as director of the central
            projects staff (1976-1979); in the transportation, water and
            telecommunications department as director of the central
            projects staff (1979-1982); at the Economic Development
            Institute (EDI) as director (1982-1990); in Bangladesh as
            chief of mission for the Asia regional office (1990-1994);
            in Belarus as chief of mission for the Europe and Central
            Asia regional office (1994-1997); in the Europe and Central
            Asia regional office as lead specialist for the transport,
            infrastructure sector unit (1997-1999); and in the
            transportation, water and urban development department of
            private sector development and infrastructure vice
            presidency as lead specialist for the transport division
