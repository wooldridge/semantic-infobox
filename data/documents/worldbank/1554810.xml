EXTRACTO&#13;
El presente documento se centra principalmente en la relaci6n entre la&#13;
tributaci6n y los tres componentes principales del ahorro --a saber, el ahorro&#13;
puiblico, el personal y el del medio empresarial. Se concede importancia sobre&#13;
todo a la reforma tributaria con la mira de recaudar ingresos adicionales y&#13;
alentar el ahorro tanto de las unidades familiares como de las empresas. La&#13;
atenci6n se limita a la esfera de los impuestos federales, sin que se incluyan&#13;
los establecidos por las provincias y las autoridades locales. En las&#13;
propuestas de reforma tributaria se toman en cuenta tanto la necesidad de&#13;
mantener en un minimo las distorsiones ocasionadas por los impuestos en la&#13;
asignaci6n de los recursos como tambien algunas consideraciones de equidad. Se&#13;
destacan ademas otros aspectos importantes de un mayor nivel de ahorro, tales&#13;
como las politicas adecuadas en materia de gastos corrientes, subvenciones,&#13;
cargos a los usuarios, fijaci6n de precios en las empresas puiblicas y&#13;
autofinanciamiento de las inversiones de dichas empresas.&#13;
Ce document traite essentiellement des rapports existant au Pakistan&#13;
entre l'impot et les trois principaux types d'6pargne - A savoir l1'pargne&#13;
publique, l'epargne des menages et l'epargne des entreprises. Il met l'accent&#13;
sur une reforme fiscale visant A degager des recettes supplementaires et A&#13;
encourager l'epargne des menages et des entreprises. Seuls sont consideres les&#13;
imp6ts fed6raux, ceux qui sont percus par les provinces et les autorites locales&#13;
n'etant pas pris en compte. Les propositions relatives A une reforme fiscale&#13;
tiennent compte de la necessite de limiter au maximum les distorsions qu'en-&#13;
traine le regime fiscal dans la repartition des ressources, et aussi de conside-&#13;
rations de justice sociale. Le document traite egalement d'autres aspects&#13;
importants d'un accroissement de l'epargne, tels que des politiques appropriees&#13;
en ce qui concerne les depenses courantes, les subventions, les tarifs payes par&#13;
les usagers, le systeme tarifaire des entreprises publiques ainsi que&#13;
l'autofinancement de leurs investissements.&#13;

PAKISTAN: SELECTED ISSUES IN DOMESTIC RESOURCE MOBILIZATION&#13;
1. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
1.1     Pakistan has a comparatively low savings rate.   The rate of gross&#13;
domestic saving has fluctuated in recent years in the range of 6-7%; aided&#13;
by migrants' remittances, the rate of national saving has varied between&#13;
11-13%.1/ WLtth the current rate of domestic investment of 16%, the resource&#13;
gap (the excess of import of goods and services over their export) has&#13;
amounted to over 4% of GNP (Table 1.1). Given the size of Pakistan's finan-&#13;
cial requirements and a declining trend in recelpts of net external assis-&#13;
tance Ln real terms, the present reliance on foreign savings for financing&#13;
investment is unlikely to be sustainable. Domestic resource mobilization is,&#13;
therefore, a major concern of economic policy in Pakistan.&#13;

1.2     The recently promulgated Sixth Five Year Plan, 1983-88 proposes to&#13;
raise the rates of investment and saving to 19% and 16.5%, respectively, by&#13;
the end of the plan period. The importance of lifting the savings rate is&#13;
fully recognized. The plan states: "During the Sixth Plan, the saving&#13;
strategy has to be geared to break ,Itcisively the historical stalemate in the&#13;
saving effort. Raising the ratio of national saving to GNP to around 16.5&#13;
percent is the absolute mn;tituin for the realization of Sixth Plan goals."2/&#13;
1/ The rate of saving may be understated somewhat if, as is widely believed,&#13;
investment is underestimated, especially in small-scale manufacturing.&#13;
Since saving is derived from the familiar national accounting identity&#13;
I=(M-X)+S, underestimation of investment would also understate saving.&#13;

1.3     The issue of the mobilization of domestic resources for the public&#13;
sector goes beyond that of raising the rate of public savings. In the public&#13;
sector, domestic resources must be mobilized not only to raise the savings&#13;
rate but also to meet the recurring costs of public services. The Sixth Plan&#13;
objective of correcting the relative neglect of the social sector in the past&#13;
would require greater resources for recurrent costs. In view of the virtual&#13;
constancy of public sector development expenditures in real terms and inade-&#13;
quacy of allocations for maintenance of infrastructure and efficient opera-&#13;
tion of public services in recent years, mobilization of domestic resouces by&#13;
the public sector is especially important at this juncture.&#13;
1.4     While still low in relation to investment requirements, public saving&#13;
(that is, saving by general government, public enterprises and local&#13;
authorities) has displayed an encouraging trend in recent years. Public&#13;
saving as a percentage of GNP rose from 1.7% to 2.7% between FY78 to FY82,&#13;
with the result that public saving now finances 30% of public investment&#13;
compared to 16% in FY78 (Table 1.2). The share of own saving in investment&#13;
by general government (federal and provincial combined) has risen from under&#13;
a third in FY78 to nearly one half in FY82. There has also been a slight&#13;
improvement in self-financing by public sector enterprises (autonomous and&#13;
semi-autonomous public bodies); these presently finance 15-20% of their&#13;
investment from internal resources compared to about 10% in the late 1970s.&#13;
1.5     Nonetheless, the main imbalance between saving and investment in&#13;
Pakistan arises in the public sector. Although accounting for two thirds of&#13;
fixed investment, the public sector contributes only a quarter of national&#13;
saving. The greatest disparity between investment and saving occurs in the&#13;
public enterprise sector, which undertook investment of Rs 20.5 billion in&#13;
FY82 but generated saving of only Rs 3.2 billion. The investment/saving gap&#13;
for general government was much lower; the sector's investment and saving&#13;
amounted to Rs 10 billion and Rs 5 billion, respectively. This saving per-&#13;
formance was achieved, in part, by holding down recurrent expenditures on&#13;
basic economic and social services below desirable levels and understates the&#13;
financing problem.&#13;
1.6     With its saving greatly in excess of investment, the private sector&#13;
contributed significantly to the financing of the investment/saving gap in&#13;
the public sector. In FY82, private fixed investment and saving amounted to&#13;
Rs 16.3 billion and Rs 30.8 billion, respectively. Most saving in Pakistan,&#13;
in fact, originates in the non-corporate private sector.1/&#13;
1/ Estimates of different components of saving have been attempted in&#13;

Analysis (D.Phil. Thesis, University of Oxford, 1980).&#13;

1.7     This report focuses mainly on the relationship between taxation and&#13;
the three main components of saving--public, personal and business savings.&#13;
The emphasis is on tax reform with a view to raising additional revenues and&#13;
encouraging household and business savings. Attention is confined to federal&#13;
taxes; taxes levied by the provinces and local authorities are not con-&#13;
sidered. Proposals for tax reform take account of the need to keep&#13;
tax-induced distortions in the allocation of resources to a minimum as well&#13;
as equity considerations. Other important aspects of improved saving such as&#13;
appropriate policies on current expenditures, subsidies, user charges, public&#13;
enterprise pricing, and self-financing of investment by public enterprises&#13;
are also highlighted.&#13;
1.8     Policies to stimulate national saving are more likely to succeed if&#13;
they are aimed at all three components of saving, since concentration on a&#13;
single component may result in a reduction of other types of saving.&#13;
Policies must also take account of interrelationships among different forms&#13;
of saving. In particular, effects of taxes on personal and corporate savings&#13;
need to be considered.&#13;
1.9     The major objective in relation to private saving should be to&#13;
improve the overall climate for saving as well as incentives for investment.&#13;
The availability of suitable savings instruments, especially in rural areas,&#13;
and the existence of a tax structure that is conducive to company saving are&#13;
critical in this connection.    Given that the Sixth Plan envisages an&#13;
expanded role for the private sector, it is also important that the public&#13;
sector does not pre-empt too large a proportion of private savings.&#13;
1.10    Higher tax effort alone will not help to raise sufficient resources&#13;
for the public sector. Tax policy should, therefore, be supplemented by&#13;
appropriate policies on user charges, subsidies and self-financing by public&#13;
enterprises. The ability of public enterprises to finance their investment&#13;
from their own resources and tax policy will be the major determinants of&#13;
public saving. The large gap between the investment requirements of public&#13;
enterprises and the internal generation of funds makes higher self-financing&#13;
by public enterprises of crucial importance in improving the public sector's&#13;
saving performance.&#13;
1.11    The two main areas of taxation that have not been adequately tapped&#13;
so far are agricultural income and domestically produced goods.     In the area&#13;
of individual income tax, improvements in tax administration are likely to be&#13;
more important as a source of additional revenues than changes in the struc-&#13;
ture of the tax unless major structural changes are made. Even with a more&#13;
broadly based income tax, it appears that over the next few years the greater&#13;
proportion of additional tax revenues will need to come from indirect rather&#13;
than direct taxes.&#13;
&#13;

1.12    Proposed changes in the sales tax, excise duties, the taxation of&#13;
petroleum products, agricultural taxation and the tax treatment of per-&#13;
quisites would have a large revenue impact. Import liberalization can also&#13;
be expected to have a significant effect on revenues. Other tax measures&#13;
discussed in the report are more important for their implications for&#13;
efficiency and equity than for their potential effects on revenue.&#13;
1.13    Other main conclusions of the report are as follows:&#13;
Taxation of Personal Income and Wealth&#13;
- Any increase in the personal allowance of Rs 12,000 over the next&#13;
few years should be modest (paragraphs 3.8 and 3.9);&#13;
- Perquisites (fringe benefits) should be taxed to the fullest extent&#13;
consistent with administrative practicability (paragraph 3.10);&#13;
- The investment allowance is sufficiently high and should not be&#13;
increased for some time (paragraph 3.17);&#13;
- The taxation of agricultural incomes through the income tax should&#13;
be seriously considered when the working of ushr becomes clearer (paragraphs&#13;
3.23 - 3.24); and&#13;
- Greater coordination between zakat and the wealth tax is needed&#13;
(paragraphs 3.27 - 3.29).&#13;
Indirect Taxation&#13;
- A broad-based sales tax should be introduced as soon as politically&#13;
and administratively feasible (paragraphs 4.20 - 4.22);&#13;
- It is desirable that the sales tax be a purely revenue tax which&#13;
treats imports and domestic goods in the same manner (paragraphs 4.25 -&#13;
4.28);&#13;
- Price controls that seriously depress the growth of tax revenues,&#13;
especially from excise duties, should be avoided (paragraph 4.16); and&#13;
- Taxes on petroleum products should play a larger role in resource&#13;
mobilization (paragraphs 4.13 and 4.14).&#13;
Personal Saving&#13;
- The exemption of interest from national savings schemes should be&#13;
extended to all interest income up to a specified amount, irrespective of&#13;
source (paragraphs 3.18 - 3.20 and 5.5 - 5.7);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
- Higher real returns on commercial bank deposits would facilitate&#13;
mobilization of savings in rural areas (paragraphs 5.14 - 5.15 and 5.19); and&#13;
- A detailed study on the possibilities of increasing personal saving&#13;
through a further development of private provident funds is desirable&#13;
(paragraphs 5.25 and 5.30).&#13;
Taxation and Company Saving&#13;
- The structure of company taxation should be simplified by con-&#13;
solidating different taxes on companies (paragraphs 6.3 - 6.5 and 6.10); and&#13;
- Some reduction in the overall rate of company taxation seems&#13;
desirable (paragraphs 6.9 and 6.14).&#13;

2. PUBLIC SECTOR FINANCES&#13;
2.1     Pakistan's public sector is large and diverse.   It comprises the&#13;
Federal and Provincial Governments, local authorities (which are referred to&#13;
as local bodies in Pakistan) and public and semi-public enterprises. This&#13;
chapter gives a broad statistical picture of the public sector and outlines&#13;
the main issues in public sector finances. The discussion should serve as a&#13;
backdrop against which the possibilities and limitations of tax policy as a&#13;
means of mobilizing domestic resources by the public sector may be judged.&#13;
2.2     The budgetary process in Pakistan revolves around the federal budget,&#13;
the four provincial budgets and the Annual Development Plan (ADP). The ADP&#13;
includes all development expenditures of Federal and Provincial Governments,&#13;
but only part of the development expenditures undertaken by public&#13;
enterprises. All development expenditures of public enterprises financed by&#13;
the Federal Government and part of the expenditures financed from the public&#13;
enterprises own resources are included in the ADP; some expenditures&#13;
financed through internally-generated resources and all expenditures financed&#13;
through bank credit and foreign resources do not thus form part of the ADP.&#13;
The ADP also excludes development expenditures of public financial institu-&#13;
tions and local bodies.l/ The Post Office, and the Telegraph and Telephone&#13;
Department are run as government departments and form part of the Federal&#13;
Government. On the resources side, the ADP contains contributions by the&#13;
provinces and public enterprises towards the financing of their ADP as well&#13;
1/  The omission of public financial institutions and local bodies does not&#13;
distort the picture seriously. Capital formation by public financial&#13;
institutions is estimated at Rs 285 million for FY81. The capital and&#13;
current expenditures of local bodies are estimated at Rs 2.6 billion.&#13;
See National Accounts of Pakistan, 1977-78 to 1980-81 (Karachi: Statis-&#13;
tics Division, Government of Pakistan, 1981).&#13;
&#13;

as the Federal Government's contributions for its development expenditures&#13;
and those of the provinces and public enterprises.l/&#13;
Consolidated Public Sector&#13;
2.3       In recent years tax and non-tax current revenues have remained&#13;
constant in relation to GDP, defense and debt servicing have pre-empted a&#13;
large share of the current budget, and net external assistance has been&#13;
declining as a proportion of development expenditures and in real terms. As&#13;
a result, allocations for the recurring costs of major economic and social&#13;
services have suffered, and development spending has increased only mar-&#13;
ginally in real terms.2/ The public sector now faces the difficult problem of&#13;
simultaneously improving the standard of existing services and increasing the&#13;
rate of public saving.&#13;
2.4     Current revenues have amounted to 16-17% of GDP between FY78 and&#13;
FY82, with tax/GDP and non-tax/GDP ratios amounting to 12-14% and 3-4%,&#13;
respectively (Table 2.1). The stability of the tax/GDP ratio, despite&#13;
sizable tax increases introduced in some recent years, suggests a low elas-&#13;
ticity of tax receipts.   The crucial tasks of tax policy are, therefore, to&#13;
raise the share of GDP taken in taxes and to improve the elasticity of tax&#13;
revenues.&#13;
2.5       User charges for services (which form part of nonr-tax receipts)&#13;
have not been extensively used by the Federal and Provincial Governments.&#13;
The receipts from charges for services account for 4% of the combined federal&#13;
and provincial current revenues. Even when imposed, user charges recoup only&#13;
a small proportion of the cost of services. As is to be expected, the bulk&#13;
1/  Public sector statistics reflect these budgetary procedures.    The con-&#13;
solidated public sector statistics used in this chapter include all&#13;
expenditures and revenues of the Federal and Provincial Governments but&#13;
only that portion of the development expenditures of public enterprises&#13;
that forms part of the ADP. Development expenditures of public&#13;
enterprises undertaken outside the ADP are not included; nor are the&#13;
development expenditures of public financial institutions and local&#13;
bodies. To avoid double-counting, transfers between the different seg-&#13;
ments of the public sector are eliminated when considering the con-&#13;
solidated public sector. However, when provincial and public enterprise&#13;
finances are discussed, transfers are retained; elimination of transfers&#13;
when a single segment of the public sector is under consideration would&#13;
give a misleading picture.&#13;
2/ Trends in public sector finances are discussed in detail in the Bank's&#13;
economic reports on Pakistan. See, for example, Pakistan, Economic&#13;
Developments and Prospects (Report No. 4215-PAK, February 1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
of the receipts come from economic rather than social and community services.&#13;
In FY82 the federal collections of non-tax receipts from economic, social and&#13;
community services amounted to only Rs 370 million. The provincial collec-&#13;
tions were Rs 1.7 billion, one half of which came from water charges for&#13;
irrigation, discussed below. Provincial receipts from charges for economic&#13;
services amount to about one half of the provincial current expenditures on&#13;
economic services, including irrigation (see Tables 2.7 and 2.8).&#13;
2.6     The demands made by the public sector on national resources have&#13;
declined somewhat in recent years; public expenditures presently absorb 22.6%&#13;
of GDP compared to 24.3% of GDP in FY78. The decline is mainly explained&#13;
by a slow growth in development expenditures, current expenditures having&#13;
remained remarkably stable at 14% of GDP. Defense imposes a heavy burden on&#13;
the current budget, absorbing about 40% of it. With debt servicing (interest&#13;
payments in respect of domestic and foreign debt) claiming about 15% of the&#13;
current budget, defense and debt servicing account for over 55% of current&#13;
expenditures. The pre-emption of such a large proportion of the current&#13;
budget by these outlays has restricted the resources that can be devoted to&#13;
other activities. There are no completely satisfactory indices for reducing&#13;
public expenditures to real terms, but deflating public expenditures by the&#13;
implicit GDP deflator suggests that current expenditures on important serv-&#13;
ices such as agriculture, education and health may not have expanded much in&#13;
real terms in recent years. While this aggregative evidence is suggestive,&#13;
sufficient insight can only be gained by studying individual services in&#13;
detail.&#13;

2.7     Subsidies feature in both the federal and provincial budgets and are&#13;
provided through the development as well as the current budget (Table 2.5).&#13;
The main subsidies in current expenditures are for wheat and exports.l/ The&#13;
cost of the fertilizer subsidy is treated as a development expenditure. The&#13;
only subsidy of any consequence at the provincial level is that for wheat.&#13;
Resources diverted to subsidies have been reduced since FY80 when they&#13;
absorbed nearly a fifth of the combined current expenditures of the Federal&#13;
and Provincial Governments (adjusted by treating the subsidy for fertilizers&#13;
as a current expenditure). Subsidies cost about Rs 4 billion in FY82 and&#13;
accounted for 8.5% of the combined current expenditures. Although subsidies&#13;
are now less important than in the past, further reductions could still free&#13;
sizable resources for other purposes. The Government has decided to phase&#13;

2.8     ADP expenditures as a percentage of GDP fell fran 9.9% in FY78 to&#13;
8.4% in FY82 and also seem to have remained approximately constant in real&#13;
terms since FY79. Even when account is taken of development expenditures of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
public enterprises outside the ADP, total development expenditures do not&#13;
show much increase in real terms.l/&#13;
2.09    Net external assistance varied between Rs 6-8 billion annually during&#13;
FY78-FY82 (Table 2.2). External resources financed about a quarter of the&#13;
ADP in FY82, compared to over a third in FY78. Since the prices (unit&#13;
values) of Pakistan's imports are estimated to have risen by about 70% during&#13;
the period, net external assistance has declined steadily in real terms.&#13;
Should this trend continue, the problem of mDbilizing domestic resources&#13;
would become both more urgent and difficult.&#13;
Provincial Governments 2/&#13;
2.10    The imbalance between provincial responsibilities and revenues and&#13;
the limited control by provinces over their revenues are the two main issues&#13;
in provincial finances. The former reflects in part the overall domestic&#13;
resource constraint in the public sector. The problem of finding, for lower&#13;
tiers of government, sufficient independent revenues (that is, major sources&#13;
whose tax rates they could vary) has not been successfully tackled in most&#13;
developing countries. A National Finance Commission is presently engaged in&#13;
the periodic review of the financial relationships between the Federal and&#13;
Provincial Governments provided for in the Pakistan Constitution.&#13;
2.11    Provincial Governments play an important role in the provision of&#13;
services, but their involvement in resource mobilization is limited. The&#13;
provinces have major responsibilities in the areas of education (excluding&#13;
universities), health (excluding some hospitals), the irrigation system,&#13;

domestic water supply, roads, agricultural support services and internal law&#13;
and order (i.e., police). On the other hand, they derive the bulk of their&#13;
tax revenues through tax sharing arrangements with the Federal Government,&#13;
and their development expenditures are largely financed by the Federal&#13;
Government, mostly in the form of soft loans.l/&#13;
2.12    Provincial Governments presently receive 80% of the proceeds (net of&#13;
costs of collection) from the following taxes collected by the Federal&#13;
Government:  (i) export duty on cotton; (ii) sales tax; and (iii) personal&#13;
and company income taxes (excluding the income tax paid by federal&#13;
employees).  These divisible taxes are allocated on the basis of population&#13;
(Punjab 60.25%, Sind 22.50%, NWFP 13.39% and Baluchistan 3.86%).2/ The&#13;
provinces also receive the revenues from the excise duty and royalty on&#13;
natural gas, and the gift tax; the former are divided on the basis of the&#13;
location of well-heads, and the latter on the basis of actual receipts from&#13;
different provinces.&#13;
2.13    Resources are also transferred to the two poorer provinces outside&#13;
the framework of revenue sharing. The Federal Government meets the current&#13;
deficits of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Baluchistan, which&#13;
are estimated at Rs 875 million and Rs 286 million, respectively, for FY83.&#13;
It also provides the NWFP and Baluchistan fixed annual grants of Rs 100&#13;
million and Rs 50 million, respectively.&#13;
2.14    The provinces  independent revenues are relatively insignificant.&#13;
The provinces cannot influence the shared revenues, which account for 80%f of&#13;
their tax revenues (Table 2.6).   With receipts from provincial taxes and&#13;
non-tax levies growing more slowly than receipts from shared taxes, the&#13;
provinces- dependence on shared revenues has increased in recent years;&#13;
shared revenues provided 60% of provincial current revenues in FY82 compared&#13;
to 45% in FY78. Between FY78 and FY82, the share of provincial taxes in&#13;
current revenues fell from 20% to 16%, and that of non-tax levies from 18% to&#13;
14%. Moreover, the relative contribution of non-shared revenues (all current&#13;
receipts except shared revenues and federal grants) of 30% understates the&#13;
lack of revenue flexibility because the major tax sources under provincial&#13;
control (e.g., motor vehicle tax, stamp duties, entertainment tax) are not&#13;
very responsive to general economic development (Table 2.7).&#13;
1/ A consequence of this has been the growth in provincial expenditures on&#13;
debt servicing. Most of the expenditure on debt servicing shown in Table&#13;
2.8 is in respect of federal loans.&#13;
2/ For details of the evolution of tax sharing arrangements as well as the&#13;
present arrangements, see Statutory Orders Regulating the Allocation of&#13;
Revenues between the Federal Government and the Provinces (Government of&#13;
Pakistan, 1975).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
2.15    The single most important source of non-shared revenue for the&#13;
provinces is the water charge for irrigation (abiana). Although higher&#13;
charges have helped to increase revenues from water charges in recent years,&#13;
the receipts covered only 60 of the cost of operating and maintaining the&#13;
irrigation system in FY82. The complex analytical problem of determining the&#13;
appropriate level and structure of irrigation water charges has been much&#13;
debated in Pakistan. A recent study concluded that there is substantial&#13;
scope for improving revenues from this source.l/&#13;
2.16    The inadequacy of recurrent expenditures to provide a reasonable&#13;
quality of basic economic and social services is perhaps the most serious&#13;
financial problem at the provincial level. Although there has been some real&#13;
growth in per capita terms in provincial recurrent expenditures on all major&#13;
services except education (total outlays on which do not seem to have grown&#13;
in real terms) in recent years, detailed sectoral work indicates that the&#13;
quality of many services is poor and that insufficient allocations for opera-&#13;
tion and maintenance have prevented an efficient use of existing facilities&#13;
and assets.2/ A shift of emphasis from development to recurrent expenditures&#13;
therefore appears to be needed, since some of the country's objectives would&#13;
be better met by a fuller use of existing facilities than by the creation of&#13;
new ones.&#13;

Public Sector Enterprises&#13;
2.17    The large investment requirements of public sector enterprises make&#13;
their ability to generate internal resources for investment of critical&#13;
importance in domestic resource mobilization. Proposed investment by public&#13;
sector enterprises (ADP and non-ADP) amounted to about 45% of total public&#13;
sector development expenditures in FY83. While self-financing by public&#13;
enterprises has increased in recent years, internal resources still finance a&#13;
small proportion of the investment requirements, and the bulk of the resour-&#13;
ces are generated by a few enterprises. The gap between the public&#13;
enterprises' investment and self-financing is so large that it would be&#13;
difficult to ease the overall domestic resource constraint unless public&#13;
enterprises meet a much larger proportion of their investment requirements&#13;
from their own funds.&#13;
2.18    As already explained, public enterprise investment occurs partly&#13;
within the ADP and partly outside it. All public enterprise investment&#13;
financed from Government (budgetary) resources and most of the investment&#13;
covered by self-financing form part of the ADP. Besides self-financing, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
resources for investment outside the ADP come from borrowing from domestic&#13;
commercial banks and the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC), and&#13;
from foreign sources, mostly in the form of credits (Table 2.9).&#13;
2.19    Public enterprise investment for FY83 is projected at Rs 17.8 bil-&#13;
lion, of which Rs 10.6 billion is included in the ADP and Rs 7.2 billion&#13;
would be undertaken outside the ADP. The proposed sources of finance for&#13;
the total investment are Government resources of Rs 7.8 billion (which would&#13;
cover 44% of the total investment), self-financing of Rs 4.1 billion (23%),&#13;
bank borrowing of Rs 3.4 billion (19.5%) and external resources of Rs 2.4&#13;
billion (13.5%). Should the target for self-financing be realized, internal&#13;
funds would finance a higher proportion of the investment by public&#13;
enterprises than in the past.&#13;

2.20.   In the past, the main contribution to self-financing has come from&#13;
the power wing of the Water and Power Development Authority (Table 2.12).&#13;
In FY83, the energy and the transport sectors are expected to account for&#13;
most of the self-financing (Tables 2.10 and 2.11). In the energy sector, the&#13;
Water and Power Development Authority, Karachi Electricity Supply Corpora-&#13;
tion, Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Ltd., Karachi Gas Company and the Oil and Gas&#13;
Development Corporation are expected to finance sizable proportions of&#13;
investment from their own resources; the same is true of the Pakistan Inter-&#13;
national Airlines Corporation and the National Shipping Corporation in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
transport sector. This favorable picture is greatly modified when manufac-&#13;
turing enterprises are considered. The ADP and non-ADP development outlays&#13;
of industrial enterprises are projected at Rs 4.5 billion, of which&#13;
self-financing is expected to account for about Rs 151 million, or 3% of&#13;
investment; the performance remains disappointing even when steel is&#13;
excluded. l/&#13;
2.21    The ability of public enterprises to generate funds for financing&#13;
their investment programs depends on a number of factors, including their&#13;
technical and managerial efficiency, and pricing policies.2/ There is little&#13;
that can be said about the measures needed to improve the saving performance&#13;
of public enterprises in general terms. Only careful evaluations of&#13;
individual enterprises can point to the appropriate policies.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
2.22    A significant improvement in the rate of public saving will require&#13;
higher saving by both general government and public sector enterprises.&#13;
Given the relatively low level of self-financing by public enterprises, even&#13;
a substantially improved saving performance by Federal and Provincial Govern-&#13;
ments would leave a large imbalance between investment and saving in the&#13;
public sector. Policies to effect a marked improvement in the generation of&#13;
internal resources by public enterprises should, therefore, be given high&#13;
priority.&#13;
2.23    The achievement of a higher savings rate by Federal and Provincial&#13;
Governments will require the use of all available instruments. While there&#13;
would seem to be substantial scope for raising tax revenues as discussed in&#13;
the following two chapters, higher tax effort alone cannot be expected to&#13;
have a large impact on the saving rate in view of the need to improve the&#13;
standard of existing public services and to provide for the recurrent costs&#13;
of new services. Greater reliance on user charges and reduced use of sub-&#13;
sidies should, therefore, supplement tax policy.&#13;
1/ High debt/equity ratios in industrial enterprises may have been one major&#13;
factor limiting their ability to generate internal funds for investment.&#13;
2/  For a discussion of some of these aspects, see Leroy Jones, Efficiency of&#13;
Public Enterprises in Pakistan (prepared for the Pakistan Ministry of&#13;
Production, mimeo, February 1981).&#13;

3. TAXATION OF PERSONAL INCOME AND WEALTH&#13;
3.1     Five taxes dominate Pakistan's tax structure. Together, individual&#13;
and company income taxes, import and excise duties, and the sales tax account&#13;
for 95% of federal tax revenues (Table 3.1). Export duties, which were an&#13;
important source of revenues in the early 1970s, presently play a minor role&#13;
in the tax structure.l/ The taxation of capital gains has been suspended&#13;
since 1975. Revenues from federal taxes amount to about 12.4% of GDP.&#13;
3.2     The tax structure also contains two levies - zakat and ushr - derived&#13;
from the country's Islamic traditions. The receipts from these levies do&#13;
not form part of the budget, but are distributed to the indigent (par-&#13;
ticularly widows, orphans and the disabled). With the introduction of zakat,&#13;
the taxation of net wealth has assumed importance (see paragraph 3.26 below).&#13;
3.3     The most dramatic change in the tax structure over the past decade&#13;
has been the emergence of import duties as the largest source of revenue.&#13;
The contribution of import duties to total revenues rose from 21% in FY72 to&#13;
37% in FY82. This trend was also reflected in the ratio of import duty&#13;
receipts to GDP, which increased from 2.1% to 4.6%. The share of excise&#13;
duties in both total revenues and GDP fell, while that of the sales tax rose&#13;
modestly. Excise and sales taxes accounted for 29% and 8% of tax revenues,&#13;
respectively. The relative share of income tax in tax revenues, which stood&#13;
at 21% in FY82, fell slightly despite an increase in the ratio of income tax&#13;
receipts to GDP from 2.3% to 2.6% during the period. Reflecting these&#13;
trends, the relative share of indirect taxes rose from 74% to 78%.&#13;
1/ Export taxes on a wide range of products were imposed after the devalua-&#13;
tion of 1972 to capture part of the windfall profits accruing to&#13;
exporters. Export taxes are now confined to raw cotton, hides and skins,&#13;
molasses and stainless steel scrap.&#13;

3.4     This chapter discusses the individual income tax and the two main&#13;
taxes on capital, zakat and the wealth tax.l/ Company income tax, including&#13;
the treatment of dividends in the hands of the shareholders, is discussed in&#13;
Chapter 6. Indirect taxation forms the subject of the next chapter.&#13;
The Individual Income Tax&#13;
3.5     The individual income tax has been simplified over the last few years&#13;
by reducing the range of allowances, with the result that the number of&#13;
remaining concessions is small. The major exemption is for agricultural&#13;
income, which is excluded from income tax entirely. Other income earners&#13;
have a basic exemption of Rs 12,000, irrespective of family size. Tax relief&#13;
for saving is provided through an investment allowance and the exemption of&#13;
interest from certain instruments. Finally, perquisites (fringe benefits)&#13;
are treated more favorably than other forms of income. These features of the&#13;
tax system are reviewed below.&#13;
3.6     The introduction and development of a self-assessment scheme,2/ use&#13;
of surveys to identify taxpayers and other improvements in tax administration&#13;
have contributed substantially to the rapid growth of income tax revenues&#13;
over the last few years. Between FY79 and FY82, the number of taxpayers&#13;
doubled, increasing from 500,000 to a million, and income tax receipts from&#13;
individuals and businesses rose from Rs 3.3 billion to Rs 8.3 billion, or by&#13;
80% in real terms. Of the total taxpayers, about 240,000 are employees and&#13;
8,000 are companies, with the remainder consisting of the self-employed,&#13;
unincorporated firms and associations.&#13;
3.7     The possibilities for raising significant additional revenues from&#13;
the individual income tax would depend largely on the extent to which the tax&#13;
base can be enlarged. While the recent broadening of the tax base represents&#13;
a considerable achievement, the tax base is still narrow, mainly because of&#13;
the exclusion of agricultural income and the inherent difficulties of taxing&#13;
the self-employed and small businesses.&#13;
3.8     Personal Exemptions. To judge whether the present personal allowance&#13;
of Rs 12,000 is realistic, its size must be reviewed in relation to the&#13;
income needed for subsistence by a family of an average size, and the ability&#13;
of the tax authorities to reach non-salary incomes just above the exemption&#13;
1/ Only the salient features of these taxes will be explained here. A&#13;
detailed description is given in Annex I.&#13;

Scheme for 1981-82 (Islamabad:  Central Board of Revenue, 1981).&#13;

level. In the absence of reliable direct estimates of income needed for&#13;
subsistence, some assumptions must be made. Taking six persons to a&#13;
household and assuming that an income of 75% of per capita GNP is needed for&#13;
subsistence gives the income needed for subsistence by the household of about&#13;
Rs 17,785.1/ This suggests that the present allowance is at about the right&#13;
level, since only nominal amount of income tax is payable on total incomes&#13;
just above the present exemption level.2/ On the other hand, since the&#13;
exemption is effectively at about the same level as the subsistence require-&#13;
ments, the taxation of small businesses with incomes just above the exemption&#13;
level must present difficulties. However, the magnitude of this problem is&#13;
unlikely to be affected noticeably unless the allowance is raised sig-&#13;
nificantly.&#13;
3.9     Furthermore, the present allowance is generous for small families,&#13;
and for families with more than one earner.3/ All in all, therefore, the&#13;
size of the present allowance seems reasonable.&#13;
3.10    Treatment of Perquisites. The proper tax treatment of cash and&#13;
non-cash benefits provided by the employer as part of salary could bring&#13;
substantial additional revenues. Perquisites are not being adequately taxed&#13;
at present (Table 3.2). The main concession is for housing but that for&#13;
transport is also important. The maximum income imputed to the employee for&#13;
unfurnished housing provided by an employer is only 10% of the former's&#13;
salary. Given current housing costs in Pakistan, this conveys considerable&#13;
benefits. The maximum taxable amount for transport provided for the business&#13;
and personal use of an employee is only Rs 3,600. The principal objective in&#13;
the treatment of fringe benefits should be to tax them to the fullest extent&#13;
consistent with administrative practicability and not to convey tax conces-&#13;
sions.&#13;
1/ This probably overstates the subsistence requirements. According to the&#13;
latest household budget survey, the average monthly income of an urban&#13;
household in 1979 was Rs 1,345, and 69.3% of urban households had incomes&#13;
of under Rs 1,500 per month. See Household Income and Expenditure Survey&#13;
(Karachi: Federal Bureau of Statistics, 1983).&#13;
2/ For example, the tax payable by salaried and non-salaried persons with a&#13;
total income of Rs 20,000 is Rs 120 and Rs 1,020, respectively. See&#13;
Annex I, Tables 1 and 3.&#13;
3/ Broadly, the income of an assessee's spouse is taxed separately if it is&#13;
unconnected with the assessee's business.&#13;

3.11    The relatively high marginal rates of tax at the upper end of the tax&#13;
scale overstate the rates that apply in practice, given especially the&#13;
present treatment of perquisites. Adequate taxation of perquisites could,&#13;
therefore, be accompanied by some reductions in marginal rates at high&#13;
incomes.&#13;
3.12    It is recognized that the present salary structure in the country&#13;
takes account of the undervaluation of perquisites for tax purposes, and that&#13;
a change in the present practice may lead to the need in some cases for&#13;
adjustments in salary levels. Despite this, and apart from its possible&#13;
contribution to revenues, adequate taxation of perquisites would be desirable&#13;
for the important contribution it could make to the equity of the tax system.&#13;
3.13    Investment Allowance.   The investment allowance is granted for&#13;
investment in qualifying assets of up to 1/3 of total income, with a maximum&#13;
of Rs 50,000. The allowance is essentially a tax rebate given at the tax-&#13;
payer's average rate of income tax. Thus, a taxpayer investing Rs 100 and&#13;
paying tax at the average rate of 20% can deduct Rs 20 from his tax&#13;
liability. The qualifying investments comprise contributions to provident&#13;
and pension funds, life insurance premiums, unit trusts and mutual funds,&#13;
shares and debentures of specified public companies, and defense savings&#13;
certificates.1/&#13;
3.14    The structure of returns on assets is an important element in the&#13;
formulation of policies for encouraging personal saving. While the issue of&#13;
the magnitude of the interest elasticity of saving is by no means empirically&#13;
resolved,2/ a country with a low savings rate is well advised to proceed on&#13;
the assumption of an operationally significant elasticity of personal saving.&#13;
To the extent that personal saving responds to the rates of return, it is the&#13;
real after-tax returns that matter. Broadly, the investment allowance is&#13;
thought to be a suitable means of providing tax relief for saving, and its&#13;
operation is reviewed very briefly.&#13;
3.15    The scope of the investment allowance is comparatively wide.    While&#13;
most countries grant tax relief for saving through provident and pension&#13;
schemes and life insurance, the treatment of company shares, unit trusts and&#13;
mutual funds seems to be more generous than in other countries. However, in&#13;
view of the low interest in equities, a change in the present arrangements is&#13;
not recommended. It will be suggested later that consideration should be&#13;

given to the withdrawal of the investment allowance from defense savings&#13;
certificates.&#13;
3.16    There has been some uncertainty in Pakistan concerning the rate at&#13;
which the investment allowance should be given. Until a few years ago the&#13;
rebate was given at the taxpayer's marginal rate, but it is now given at the&#13;
taxpayer-s average rate. It would appear that tax relief at a single rate&#13;
would not be satisfactory for all assets. For instance, since pension&#13;
benefits are taxed at the marginal rate, it would seem appropriate to provide&#13;
tax relief for the contributions also at the marginal rate. On the other&#13;
hand, there is no obvious reason why tax relief for life insurance should&#13;
depend on the taxpayer's marginal rate; in this instance, tax relief at a&#13;
uniform rate, which would reduce the relative cost of life insurance for all&#13;
taxpayers equally, is probably preferable. However, since granting tax&#13;
relief for some investments at the marginal rate and for others at a uniform&#13;
rate would be administratively cumbersome, the present approach should be&#13;
retained.&#13;
3.17    The investment allowance is widely used by middle and high income&#13;
taxpayers and is perhaps the most costly concession in terms of the revenue&#13;
foregone. However desirable substantial relief for saving may be, the&#13;
revenue considerations cannot be ignored. Therefore, when details of the use&#13;
of the allowance by the type of taxpayer and asset become available,l/ the&#13;
operation of the allowance should be reviewed. Meanwhile, the allowance&#13;
seems sufficiently high and should not be increased.&#13;
3.18    Exemption of Interest from National Savings Schemes.    Interest paid&#13;
on instruments under the Government's national savings schemes is exempt from&#13;
tax, but that on commercial bank deposits is taxable. The resulting large&#13;
gap in after-tax yields on bank deposits and national savings instruments may&#13;
limit the role of the banking system in resource mobilization, especially in&#13;
rural areas, as discussed further in chapter 5.&#13;
3.19    Under the present arrangements, there is a danger that too large a&#13;
proportion of household saving may flow into the public sector. The role of&#13;
national savings schemes in the mobilization of deposits has already&#13;
increased significantly. The relative share of national savings deposits in&#13;
total deposits (national savings and bank deposits) rose from about 13% in&#13;
1971 to 19% in 1982. More striking is the gain made by national savings&#13;
1/ The publication of comprehensive income tax statistics ceased in 1972.&#13;
With the recent computerization of income tax returns, the compilation of&#13;
income tax statistics has been resumed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

schemes in fixed deposit type accounts.l/ Fixed deposits under national&#13;
saving schemes accounted for about 4C% of total fixed deposits in 1982,&#13;
compared to 26% in 1971. If the present differentials in after-tax returns&#13;
persist, fixed deposits under national savings schemes could be expected to&#13;
outstrip those at commercial banks.&#13;
3.20    The simplest way of dealing with these problems, while at the same&#13;
time retaining some tax relief for interest income, would be to exempt inter-&#13;
est from all sources up to a specified amount. Income from profit and loss&#13;
sharing (PLS) accounts,2/ which presently qualify for the dividend&#13;
exclusion,3/ should also be brought within the scope of such an exemption.&#13;
The effect of a uniform tax treatment of all interest income on tax revenues&#13;
would depend on the size of the exemption.&#13;
3.21    Exemption of Agricultural Income. Agriculture accounts for about 30%&#13;
of GDP and provides livelihood to over 50%. of the labor force. The exclusion&#13;
of such a large sector from the tax must inevitably limit the opportunities&#13;
for the mobilization of domestic resources. It can also be expected to be a&#13;
major source of inequity and inefficiency in Pakistan's tax system; these&#13;
equity and efficiency effects will tend to be magnified by the treatment of&#13;
agricultural property under the wealth tax, as explained in the following&#13;
section.&#13;
3.22    The efficiency aspect may be worth explaining in general terms. The&#13;
main assumption required for this purpose is that there is a tendency for the&#13;
net-of-tax returns to capital to be equalized in all activities. Since&#13;
gross-of-tax returns in non-agricultural activities must be higher than in&#13;
agriculture (where the absence of taxation means that gross and net returns&#13;
are equal) if comparable net-of-tax returns are to be realized in all&#13;
activities, and since the gross-of-tax return reflects the marginal produc-&#13;
tivity of capital, output could be increased by shifting capital from&#13;
activities where it has a relatively low marginal productivity (agricultural)&#13;
to those where it has a higher marginal productivity (non-agricultural). It&#13;
is this loss of real output that is referred to as the efficiency (welfare)&#13;
cost of taxation. What prevents capital from moving to activities where it&#13;
is more productive is that taxpayers are concerned with the after-tax returns&#13;
rather than the gross returns. Taxing agricultural income in the same manner&#13;
as other incomes would remove the influence of taxation in the allocation of&#13;
1/ All national savings accounts except savings accounts and prize bonds can&#13;
be considered as such accounts.&#13;
2/ The PLS accounts were introduced as part of the policy of Islamization.&#13;
The returns on these accounts are not fixed in advance but depend on the&#13;
profitability of the investments financed from such deposits.&#13;
3/ Dividends of up to Rs 15,000 from certain sources are exempt from income&#13;
tax. See Annex I, paragraph 19.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
resources between the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, thereby&#13;
encouraging resources to move in a direction which would increase national&#13;
product.&#13;
3.23    The situation with respect to the taxation of agriculture has changed&#13;
with the introduction of ushr from the rabi (winter) season 1982/83. Ushr is&#13;
a levy on the gross value of agricultural production. To make an allowance&#13;
for costs of production, the levy is restricted to 75% of the value of&#13;
production.l/ The levy is assessed on a self assessment basis, but collected&#13;
compulsorily from landowners, leaseholders and others at the rate of 5% of&#13;
their share of the produce; tenants are not subject to the compulsory levy of&#13;
ushr under the proposed system of collection. All persons with production of&#13;
under 948 kg of wheat (or its equivalent in value) are exempt.&#13;
3.24    The introduction of ushr makes an examination of other far-reaching&#13;
changes in the taxation of agricultural incomes inappropriate at the present&#13;
time. However, given the important role that the inclusion of agricultural&#13;
income in the income tax net could play in the country's resource mobi-&#13;
lization efforts over the long term, ushr should not be regarded as preclud-&#13;
ing the taxation of agriculture through income tax in the foreseeable future.&#13;
The taxation of relatively rich farmers (defined in terms of the size of the&#13;
holding or other suitable means) through income tax should be seriously&#13;
considered when ushr has been in operation for a year or two and its working&#13;
becomes clearer. Provided ushr paid is permitted to be set off against&#13;
income tax liability, all taxpayers would in effect be subject to a single&#13;
direct tax on agricultural income.&#13;
Taxation of Wealth&#13;
3.25    The wealth tax has been a part of Pakistan's tax structure since&#13;
1963. When zakat was introduced in 1980, certain assets were exempted from&#13;
the wealth tax and made liable to zakat. Both taxes are levied on net&#13;
wealth. There are separate exemption limits for movable property (Rs&#13;
300,000), and for immovable agricultural property (Rs 100,000) and&#13;
non-agricultural property (Rs 500,000 or a house used by the taxpayer) for&#13;
the wealth tax, but there is no exemption limit for zakat with the exception&#13;
of savings accounts of under Rs 2,000.   Zakat is levied at the rate of 2.5%,&#13;
as is the wealth tax on all immovable property; the rates of wealth tax on&#13;
movable property range from 0.5% to 2.5%.&#13;
3.26    Zakat is compulsorily deducted from specified assets.   Since this&#13;
method of collection requires that the assets to which the levy is applied&#13;
must be relatively easy to value, zakat is confined to financial assets such&#13;
as savings and time deposits, Government securities, shares and debentures,&#13;
1/ Two thirds where tubewell irrigation is utilized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
and mutual funds. With the inclusion of most movable assets in zakat, the&#13;
wealth tax has become primarily a tax on immovable property; about 80-85% of&#13;
the receipts from the wealth tax come from real estate. The revenue from&#13;
zakat amounted to Rs 904 million in FY82, compared to Rs 135 million from the&#13;
wealth tax. About 90% of zakat receipts are derived from deposits (Table&#13;
3.3), which dominate the holdings of financial assets by households. The&#13;
effect of zakat on returns from deposits is considered in Chapter 5.&#13;
3.27    Two taxes on wealth, differing in scope as well as exemption limits,&#13;
are bound to influence the composition of household assets. Zakat, in con-&#13;
junction with the wealth tax, would tend to encourage a shift toward assets&#13;
not subject to the compulsory deduction of zakat. The holding of&#13;
(non-financial) movable property (e.g., jewelry) would be encouraged since&#13;
the maximum rate of wealth tax for movable property (which equals the rate of&#13;
zakat) applies to only very substantial holdings of wealth (that is, movable&#13;
property in excess of Rs 2 million), and such property held by different&#13;
members of a family need not be aggregated for tax purposes. More important,&#13;
the present system of wealth taxation would encourage a shift from financial&#13;
assets to real estate, since net wealth in the form of real estate of up to&#13;
Rs 500,000, and considerably more for a taxpayer owning a luxury home (since&#13;
the taxpayer has the option of substituting a home he occupies for the&#13;
general exemption), is exempt from the wealth tax.&#13;

3.28    Although receiving a lower exemption than non-agricultural property,&#13;
agricultural property is treated much more favorably than other immovable&#13;
property. There are several reasons for this. A person is exempt from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
payment of the wealth tax on agricultural land if he is not liable to income&#13;
tax and if no tax would be payable by him on his net wealth excluding&#13;
agricultural land. This means that a person with income of under Rs 12,000&#13;
from non-agricultural sources, and with net wealth in the form of&#13;
non-agricultural immovable property of under Rs 500,000, would not be liable&#13;
to the wealth tax on agricultural land. Even when it does not qualify for an&#13;
exemption, agricultural land is likely to be taxed more lightly than other&#13;
immovable property because the value of agricultural land for tax purposes is&#13;
based on out-of-date produce index units (PIU).l/ Moreover, unlike&#13;
non-agricultural immovable property, agricultural land held by different&#13;
members of a family need not be aggregated.&#13;
3.29    Under the present system of wealth taxation, agricultural land is&#13;
treated most favorably and financial assets the least favorably. Careful&#13;
thought is needed on the measures required to avoid or reduce tax-induced&#13;
shifts in the composition of assets without vitiating the main purpose of&#13;
zakat of taxing the wealth of the more fortunate members of the society for&#13;
the benefit of the less fortunate.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
3.30    Unless some fundamental changes in income tax - such as the imposi-&#13;
tion of the tax on agricultural incomes, and the proper taxation of per-&#13;
quisites - are considered, the growth of revenues from the individual income&#13;
tax over the next few years would depend more on improvements in administra-&#13;
tion than on structural reforms. The impressive results yielded by the&#13;
recent initiatives to combat tax evasion and avoidance have already been&#13;
noted. The small number of possibilities for increasing receipts from the&#13;
individual income tax through changes in the tax structure give added impor-&#13;
tance to continuing improvements in tax administration.&#13;
3.31    There are no major possibilities for increasing the yield of taxes&#13;
on wealth. The main issue in the taxation of wealth is how to achieve&#13;
greater coordination between zakat and the wealth tax so that different types&#13;
of assets are treated more or less equally.&#13;
3.32    The importance of taxing the agricultural sector adequately cannot&#13;
be stressed too strongly. The proper taxation of agricultural incomes and&#13;
property is needed not only for revenue reasons but also for considerations&#13;
of efficiency and equity.&#13;

4. INDIRECT TAXATION&#13;
4.1     Some broad aspects of Pakistan's indirect taxes are worth noting&#13;
before reviewing individual taxes.l/ First, taxes with&#13;
revenue-cum-protective effects dominate taxes with purely revenue effects;&#13;
the three main indirect taxes all have protective effects. Second, tax&#13;
receipts from imports (import duties and sales taxes on imports) have grown&#13;
substantially but those from domestic production (excise and sales taxes on&#13;
domestically produced goods) have stagnated (in relation to GDP). Third,&#13;
most of the revenues from import duties are derived from intermediate and&#13;
capital goods and not consumer goods. This is one of the most unusual&#13;
aspects of Pakistan's tax system; it is to be explained by restrictions on&#13;
the import of consumer goods, combined with the fact that the admitted con-&#13;
sumer good imports consist mostly of goods such as food and medicines, which&#13;
are exempt or lightly taxed. These aspects will be discussed further. What&#13;
is clear, however, is that, in a tax system characterized by these features,&#13;
the protective effects of revenue measures have to be carefully considered.&#13;
Import Duties&#13;
4.2     The sizable dependence on import duties for revenues has meant that&#13;
the rates of import duties are fairly high. Most items of machinery and&#13;
equipment bear a tax of 40%, but agricultural machinery is admitted free of&#13;
tax. Most raw materials and components are taxed at rates ranging from 40.&#13;
to 100%.  Most consumer goods are taxed at rates of between 85-120%, but&#13;
higher rates apply to some consumer durables. Overall, ad valorem rates (as&#13;
distinct from specific rates) provided 75% of import duty revenues in FY82,&#13;
with the commodities taxed at the rates of 40%, 70% and 85% accounting for&#13;
about 70% of the revenues from ad valorem rates.&#13;
4.3     This structure of import duties is substantially modified by various&#13;
concessions. Imports of plant, machinery, raw materials and components for&#13;
certain purposes are allowed duty free or at concessional rates of duty. For&#13;
plant and machinery, the main concession is for balancing, modernization and&#13;
replacement (BMR): plant and machinery for specified industries is com-&#13;
pletely exempt from duty, and that for industry located in certain parts of&#13;
the country is completely or partially exempt, regardless of the nature of&#13;
the industry. In some instances, the concessions are only available if&#13;
machinery is not manufactured locally.&#13;
4.4     For raw materials and components, a preferential treatment is&#13;
accorded to the manufacture of 22 specified capital goods, a wide range of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
agricultural implements and some agricultural inputs, and the local assembly&#13;
of tractors and vehicles. As in the case of machinery, there are also BMR&#13;
and regional incentives: the duties paid on raw materials and components&#13;
used in the manufacture of the specified capital goods are completely or&#13;
partially refunded where the goods are used in certain areas and projects for&#13;
BMR.l/&#13;
4.5     Major imports such as iron and steel products, machinery, fuels,&#13;
vehicles, and yarn and fabrics contributed about 52% of import duty revenues&#13;
in FY82 (Table 4.1), compared to about 60z7. in FY73. The relative shares of&#13;
vehicles, yarn and fabrics have risen while those of iron, steel and&#13;
products, machinery and fuels have declined.&#13;
4.6     Import substitution in steel resulting from the completion of the&#13;
Karachi Steel Mill would have sizable effects on the revenues from iron,&#13;
steel and products. In FY82, these goods contributed Rs 2 billion in import&#13;
duties, or 13% of total import duty revenues. According to rough Government&#13;
estimates, these products would contribute Rs 3.7 billion less in revenues&#13;
(than would have accrued in the absence of the domestic production of steel)&#13;
when the Steel Mill achieves full capacity in 1985.&#13;

4.7     The relative contributions of consumer, intermediate and capital&#13;
goods to import duty revenues have changed somewhat in recent years; the&#13;
relative shares of consumer and intermediate goods have risen sightly while&#13;
the relative share of capital goods has fallen (Table 4.2). The increase in&#13;
the relative contribution of consumer goods from 16% in FY78 to 18% was&#13;
primarily due to higher rates of duty rather than higher consumer good&#13;
imports, which grew marginally in absolute terms.&#13;
4.8     The protective effects of import duties will be explained when other&#13;
indirect taxes have been discussed. Two aspects of import duties, however,&#13;
may be noted here. First, providing protection to selected industries and&#13;
regions by exempting machinery and raw materials used by them from duties&#13;
has an unintended effect: the use of imported rather than domestic machinery&#13;
and intermediate goods is encouraged. Second, the protective effects of the&#13;
present practice of taxing imported luxury goods, and especially consumer&#13;
durables, through relatively high rates of import duties are reinforced&#13;
through the sales tax, which subjects imported luxury goods to higher rates&#13;
of tax than similar domestic goods.&#13;

Excise Duties&#13;
4.9     The tax base for excises is domestic production rather than consump-&#13;
tion (domestic production plus imports). A major economic effect of excises&#13;
is, therefore, to reduce protection accorded through the import tariff.&#13;
Excises are at present levied on 41 commodities, 19 of which are taxed&#13;
through specific rates and the remaining 22 through ad valorem rates.&#13;
4.10    As is usual in countries with limited industrialization, most excise&#13;
revenues come from a few commodities (Table 4.3). In FY73, 80% of excise&#13;
revenue was derived from sugar, cotton yarn, natural gas, petroleum, cement,&#13;
tobacco and vegetable ghee (oil). These products contributed 88% in FY82,&#13;
though the relative shares of different products have changed significantly.&#13;
The sharp increase in the relative shares of sugar, cement and tobacco is&#13;
noteworthy; these three commodities currently account for 62.5% of excise&#13;
revenues. Equally striking is the decline in the relative contribution of&#13;
petroleum products from 33% in FY73 to 11% in FY82. Taxation of petroleum&#13;
plays a major role in resource mobilization in many countries, and its future&#13;
role in Pakistan needs to be reviewed.&#13;
4.11    Rates of excise tax on selected excisable commodities are given in&#13;
Table 4.4. Specific rates on major commodities have been converted into&#13;
approximate ad valorem rates to give some idea about the range of tax rates.&#13;
In general, the rates are not so high as to preclude further increases. Only&#13;
three commodities (cigarettes, cement and beverages) are taxed at a rate&#13;
higher than 30%. The combined rate of tax for most goods subject to both the&#13;
excise and sales taxes is about 20%.&#13;

4.12    The rate of excise duty for cotton yarn is striking. The excise is&#13;
imposed on yarn rather than on textiles because the administrative problems&#13;
of taxing textiles through an excise duty are thought to be intractable.&#13;
While administrative considerations must be taken into account in choosing&#13;
the point at which a commodity is taxed, the tax rate on cotton yarn of about&#13;
3% results in textiles being taxed at a relatively low rate. Textiles are a&#13;
major consumer good and need to be adequately taxed.&#13;
4.13    Petroleum products are taxed through import duties and development&#13;
surcharges as well as excise duties. The rate of import duty is 5% of cif&#13;
value; the rates of excise duties for gasoline and high speed diesel oil&#13;
(HSD) are 14.7% and 6.3%, respectively (Table 4.4). The development sur-&#13;
charge, which is equal to the difference between the sale price and the&#13;
'prescribed price" available to oil marketing companies, acts as a price&#13;
stabilization measure. A large proportion of the receipts from the develop-&#13;
ment surcharge is returned to oil companies by way of refunds for specific&#13;
purposes.l/ In addition, subsidies are granted to refineries to make up any&#13;
shortfall in the minimum profits guaranteed by the Government. In FY82,&#13;
receipts from taxes on petroleum products contributed about 6% to the com-&#13;
bined federal and provincial tax revenues, and net revenues from petroleum&#13;
products (tax revenues minus subsidies) about 4.3%; both percentages are no&#13;
higher than their FY78 levels (Table 4.5).&#13;
4.14    To improve revenues from petroleum taxes, consideration should be&#13;
given to, among other things, raising the overall tax rates and narrowing the&#13;
differential between tax rates on gasoline and HSD. The nominal (statutory)&#13;
rates of tax on these products (Table 4.6) do not reflect adequately the&#13;
rates at which they are effectively taxed because of the Government policy&#13;
of cross-subsidization between different products. Rough calculations sug-&#13;
gest that effective rates of tax for gasoline and HSD are 29.5% and -6.5%,&#13;
respectively.2/ HSD seems to be subsidized, though recent reductions in&#13;
international oil prices may have turned the negative effective tax rate into&#13;
1/ Refunds are made to cover: (i) transportation cost over and above the&#13;
freight margins included in consumer prices for the equalization of&#13;
prices of petroleum products; (ii) import cost of refined petroleum&#13;
products over and above the ex-refinery prices; and (iii) operating&#13;
charges of new storage constructed under Government directives. See&#13;
Explanatory Memorandum on the Budget, 1981-82, pp. 12-13.&#13;
2/ The main assumption made in the calculation of effective rates is that&#13;
the difference between ex-refinery price and cif import price (gross of&#13;
import duty) represents an implicit tax or subsidy. In addition, only&#13;
the amount of development surcharge that is not refunded has been treated&#13;
as a tax. Details of the calculations are explained in Table 4.6.&#13;

a low positive rate. Even these rates overstate true tax rates since sub-&#13;
sidies to refineries have not been taken into account. Further scope there-&#13;
fore appears to exists for raising tax revenues from petroleum products.l/&#13;
To make full use of the revenue possibilities, the disparity in the tax rates&#13;
on gasoline and HSD should be reduced. The present differential is too high&#13;
to be justified by relative refining costs; if considerations relating to the&#13;
cost of public transportation make some differential politically unavoidable,&#13;
it should be small. Approaching the matter from the point of view of highway&#13;
user charges also suggests a need for higher taxes on HSD since most of the&#13;
damage to roads is caused by trucks and buses. Lower international oil&#13;
prices provide a good opportunity for increased taxation of petroleum&#13;
products.&#13;

4.15    An important issue in the reform of excise taxation is the present&#13;
high reliance on specific rates. Specific taxes account for about 60% of&#13;
total excise revenues, and four (that is, cement, petroleum products, sugar&#13;
and vegetable ghee) out of the five largest sources of excise revenues bear&#13;
specific rates. The advantages of taxing through ad valorem rates in an&#13;
inflationary environment need no elaboration. In Pakistan, specific rates&#13;
and the Government's pricing policy are closely related, and the conversion&#13;
of specific rates into ad valorem rates may not help much unless accompanied&#13;
by a modification of the pricing policy.&#13;
4.16    The Government's pricing policy has substantially dampened the growth&#13;
of excise revenues. Cement, petroleum products, vegetable ghee and soda ash,&#13;
which are produced in the public sector, and sugar, the price of which is&#13;
controlled by the Government, account for 53% of total excise revenues and&#13;
87% of excise revenues from specific rates. According to official estimates,&#13;
additional excise revenues of at least Rs 7 billion would have been realized&#13;
in FY82 if the tax rates on five major commodities (vegetable products, motor&#13;
spirits, high speed diesel oil, light diesel oil, and furnace oil) had been&#13;
maintained at their FY78 levels in ad valorem terms.1/&#13;
The Sales Tax&#13;
4.17    Pakistan's sales tax is a single-stage tax levied on imports as well&#13;
as domestic production. Sales taxes paid on raw materials and components are&#13;
credited against the sales tax liability on finished goods. In terms of&#13;
their economic effects, three features of the sales tax are especially impor-&#13;
tant. First, domestic and imported goods are taxed at different rates. The&#13;
general rate of tax for domestically manufactured goods is 12.5%, but a few&#13;
goods are taxed at lower rates; imports are taxed at the rates of 10%, 20%&#13;
and 30%. Second, the exemptions for domestic and imported goods are dif-&#13;
ferent. A third and related feature is that, while domestic machinery is&#13;
exempt from the tax, most imported machinery is taxable.&#13;
4.18    Each of these features has a protective effect. The first two fea-&#13;
tures would give positive or negative protection depending on whether the&#13;
rate of sales tax on an imported product is higher or lower than on a similar&#13;
domestic good. The last feature results in higher protection for the&#13;
manufacture of machinery, but lower protection for industries using machinery&#13;
(since the sales tax paid on machinery cannot be set off against the sales&#13;
tax liability on finished goods). The protective effects of the sales tax&#13;
are considered more systematically later.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
4.19    About 81.5% of the revenue from the sales tax is derived from imports&#13;
(Table 4.7). Of the 18.5% that is derived from domestic goods, over three&#13;
quarters comes from domestic goods not subject to excises. The coverage of&#13;
domestic production and the differential taxation of imports and domestic&#13;
goods have contributed to the relatively low share of revenues from domesti-&#13;
cally produced goods.&#13;
4.20    The coverage of the tax on domestic production depends on general&#13;
exemptions and a cottage industry exemption. A wide range of domestic goods&#13;
are exempt from the tax.l/ Administrative considerations have been important&#13;
in determining the scope of exemptions. A variety of other considerations&#13;
have also played a role. Major commodities such as sugar, beverages,&#13;
tobacco, petroleum products and cement have been exempted because they are&#13;
taxed through excises. Social considerations may have motivated exemptions&#13;
for some goods (e.g., unprocessed foodstuffs and medicines). Exemptions&#13;
appear to have also been used to pursue economic objectives such as export&#13;
promotion (e.g., leather goods, and sports goods) and import substitution&#13;
(e.g., machinery). While a good case can be made for some of these exemp-&#13;
tions, the totality of the present exemptions cannot be justified when viewed&#13;
against the country's revenue requirements. The kind of sales tax that will&#13;
be suggested later would need to take into account administrative and equity&#13;
considerations but would not permit the pursuit of economic objectives such&#13;
as protection and export promotion; objectives of these kinds should be&#13;
pursued through other taxes.&#13;
4.21    The "cottage industry" exemption excludes firms with employment per&#13;
shift of no more than 15 persons and capital investment of no more than Rs&#13;
100,000 from the scope of taxation.2/ While very small firms must be&#13;
exempted for administrative reasons, the determination of the right level of&#13;
exemption is difficult.3/ Too small an exemption may make the task of the&#13;
tax authorities intractable, but a fairly large exemption may encourage the&#13;
fragmentation of enterprises. The present exemption seems to have resulted&#13;
in the exclusion of a relatively high amount of domestic production. This&#13;
may be due more to the difficulties of enforcing the exemption than to the&#13;
size of the exemption. Different criteria for identifying the smallest firms&#13;
1/ For details, see Annex II, Table 6.&#13;
2/ For further details, see Annex II, paragraph 22.&#13;
3/ The Government policy of encouraging small scale industry for social&#13;
reasons (e.g., employment generation) may also have influenced the size&#13;
of the exemption. Rough calculations suggest that, while employment per&#13;
unit of capital in small scale industry is generally higher than in large&#13;
scale industry, the average cost of production is also higher.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
(e.g., turnover, or physical characteristics such as electricity use, floor&#13;
space, etc.) need to be considered.&#13;
4.22    A thorough review of the present exemptions and the working of the&#13;
cottage industry provisions is urgently needed. The country's tax&#13;
authorities and other persons concerned with taxation within the Government&#13;
are in the best position to undertake such a review. There is a growing&#13;
awareness within the Government of the need for a sales tax with a wider&#13;
coverage. Some measures to broaden the tax base have been taken, and others&#13;
are being considered. The sales tax was recently extended to products such&#13;
as footwear, furniture and fixtures, and ready-made garments, where cottage&#13;
industry production is important, and its extension to other such products is&#13;
being considered. The possibility of levying the sales tax at wholesale and&#13;
retail stages on commodities that are difficult to tax at the manufacturing&#13;
stage is also being examined. Further policies to enlarge the scope of the&#13;
sales tax could benefit from an examination of the operation of sales taxes&#13;
in other Asian countries. Should it prove possible to expand the coverage of&#13;
the sales tax significantly, the prospects for resource mobilization would&#13;
brighten considerably. In the absence of a wider tax base for domestic&#13;
production, a prerequisite for a broad-based sales tax, revenue requirements&#13;
would have to be moderated or greater reliance on taxes with undesirable side&#13;
effects countenanced.&#13;

4.23    On the question of tax rates, it will be suggested later that domes-&#13;
tic goods and similar imported goods should be taxed at the same rate.&#13;
Another issue concerning tax rates is whether efficiency in the allocation of&#13;
resources requires that dif ferent types of goods be taxed at the same rate or&#13;
at different rates. This issue is explored below.&#13;
4.24      The traditional theory of taxation concluded that an ad valorem tax&#13;
at a uniform rate would be "neutral" (that is, it would not distort the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
pattern of consumption).l/ Recent research has shown that this conclusion&#13;
would only be valid if all final commodities (including leisure) could be&#13;
taxed. The modern approach is based on the assumption that leisure cannot be&#13;
taxed. The question that the modern approach (known as the theory of optimal&#13;
taxation) poses is: which tax rates will minimize distortions ("excess&#13;
burden") caused by indirect taxation, given that a specific amount of revenue&#13;
must be raised and that at least one commodity cannot be taxed? This&#13;
approach suggests that tax rates should be so chosen that the demand&#13;
(strictly, compensated demand) for all taxed commodities is reduced by the&#13;
same proportion. Since the demand for different commodities would respond&#13;
differently to an equal proportionate increase in the price of all com-&#13;
modities, a uniform rate of tax for all goods will not be optimal. It fol-&#13;
lows that considerations of efficiency in resource allocation do not imply&#13;
uniform taxation. The important conclusion is that an indirect tax at a&#13;
single, standard rate of tax cannot be justified on economic grounds even&#13;
when equity considerations are ignored. This conclusion needs to be borne&#13;
in mind in deciding the structure of sales tax rates.&#13;
4.25    The main defects of Pakistan's tax system are that the three major&#13;
indirect taxes all have protective effects, and the coverage of taxes on&#13;
domestic production achieved through excise and sales taxes is narrow. A&#13;
broader coverage of domestic production is needed for revenue purposes. It&#13;
is also needed to weaken the relationship between revenues and protection. A&#13;
lower and a less variable structure of effective protection (defined later),&#13;
which has been suggested by the preliminary findings of the study on the&#13;
effective rates of protection,2/ would be easier to reconcile with revenue&#13;
growth if an internal tax that applies equally to imports and domestic&#13;
production and has no protective effects were available. The sales tax is&#13;
well suited for development into such a tax. It is considerations such as&#13;
these that make the reform of the sales tax a matter of urgency.&#13;
4.26    There is a bewildering variety of sales taxes to choose from.    What&#13;
kind of sales tax would be suitable for Pakistan? The long term objective&#13;
should be to levy a sales tax at the wholesale stage, and for some goods at&#13;
the retail stage, so that a larger value added can be captured. At this&#13;
juncture, however, the best way to proceed would seem to be to modify the&#13;
existing sales tax by substantially extending its scope, and by removing its&#13;
1/ The theory of taxation has always been concerned with distortions in&#13;
consumption. The theory of protection, on the other hand, has been&#13;
concerned with distortions in production. The two approaches have not&#13;
been satisfactorily integrated so far.&#13;

protective effects. An outline of a sales tax with such characteristics&#13;
follows.&#13;
4.27    Consideration should be given to the introduction of a broad-based&#13;
sales tax with the following features:&#13;
(i)  Coverage.  The coverage should be as broad as possible.   Exemp-&#13;
tions should only be granted where strong equity considerations&#13;
(e.g., unprocessed foods and medicines) or insurmountable&#13;
administrative problems are involved.&#13;
(ii) Exemptions. The range of exemptions for both final and inter-&#13;
mediate (raw materials and components) goods should be as narrow&#13;
as possible. Whatever range of exemptions is decided, it should&#13;
be identical for domestic goods and imports; otherwise, the&#13;
coverage of the tax per se would give rise to protective&#13;
effects.&#13;
(iii)  Treatment of intermediate goods.   The present approach should be&#13;
retained; the set off of taxes paid on intermediate goods&#13;
against the tax liability on finished goods should be permitted.&#13;
(iv) Treatment of machinery. Machinery could either be taxed or&#13;
exempted.  Whatever treatment is decided, imported and domestic&#13;
machinery should be treated in the same manner; a differential&#13;
treatment would affect protection accorded to the manufacture of&#13;
machinery. Should it be decided to tax machinery, the tax paid&#13;
on machinery should be allowed as a set off against the tax&#13;
liability on final goods; otherwise, protection in the using&#13;
industries would be affected.&#13;
(v) Tax Rates. The tax could be levied at a single rate or at a few&#13;
different rates. Unless there are strong administrative reasons&#13;
for a single tax rate, it is desirable for equity and other&#13;
reasons that the rate structure differentiate between some broad&#13;
categories of goods. Whatever rate structure is decided, the&#13;
tax rate for a domestic good and a similar imported good should&#13;
be the same; otherwise, there would be protective effects.&#13;
4.28    A sales tax along these lines would be neutral in production in the&#13;
sense that it would not affect effective protection either for industries&#13;
producing taxable goods or for industries using taxable goods.l/ Were&#13;
1/ This does not apply where import licensing rather than taxes on imports&#13;
set domestic prices. Even so, it is advantageous to possess one tax that&#13;
treats imports and domestically produced goods in the same way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
machinery to be taxed and made subject to the same set off provisions as&#13;
intermediate goods, the tax would be equivalent to a value added tax.&#13;
4.29    A broad-based sales tax would have some implications for excise&#13;
duties. First, if a sales tax were to include most excisable commodities&#13;
(and it should), then retaining excise duties on goods that are taxed through&#13;
the sales tax at comparable rates would not make much sense. Second, if a&#13;
sales tax were to be levied at a single rate on all goods, then the tax&#13;
differentiation needed for equity and other reasons would have to be achieved&#13;
through other taxes. There are two main possibilities here. A good could be&#13;
taxed at a higher rate than the rate of sales tax by subjecting it to an&#13;
excise duty and a countervailing import duty (that is, an import duty at the&#13;
same rate as the excise duty, and in addition to that imposed for protective&#13;
purposes). Alternatively, the excises could be extended to imports. There&#13;
are no strong reasons favoring one approach over the other; administrative&#13;
convenience should, therefore, be the deciding factor.&#13;
4.30    It is sometimes argued that, if both sales and excise duties applied&#13;
to imports as well as domestic goods, then the policy on protection could be&#13;
pursued solely through import duties. This argument is only correct when&#13;
viewed in the context of nominal protection. Excises on intermediate goods&#13;
will affect effective protection in using industries.&#13;
4.31    Finally, excises have a larger role to play in the taxation of&#13;
luxuries. As has been explained, luxury goods such as consumer durables are&#13;
taxed at relatively high rates of import duties. The domestic production&#13;
of such goods would receive high protection unless relatively high excises&#13;
are imposed on such goods. In the taxation of luxury goods, as for other&#13;
goods, protective and other considerations should be kept separate.&#13;
Taxation of Domestic Production and Elasticity of Tax Revenues&#13;
4.32    As already stated, revenues from import duties have grown much faster&#13;
than revenues from excise and sales taxes. It is to be expected, therefore,&#13;
that revenues from taxes on imports (import duties and sales taxes on&#13;
imports) grew more rapidly than from taxes on domestic production (excise and&#13;
sales taxes on domestic production). This is, indeed, the case (Tables 4.8&#13;
and 4.9). Reflecting higher tax rates as well as a rising average propensity&#13;
to import (ratio of imports to GDP), import revenues as a percentage of GDP&#13;
rose from 3% to 5% over the past decade. By contrast, the ratio of revenues&#13;
from domestic production to GDP remained sticky at 4% of GDP. This ratio&#13;
would understate efforts to tax domestic production to the extent that taxes&#13;
on imported inputs have been used to tax indirectly domestic production that&#13;
could not be taxed directly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
4.33    The above trends are reflected in the estimates of buoyancy of tax&#13;
receipts from different sources (Table 4.10).l/ The buoyancy coefficients&#13;
indicate that, on the average, whereas the revenue from taxes on imports&#13;
increased by 1.39% for every percentage increase in GNP, the corresponding&#13;
increase in the revenue from taxes on domestic production was only 1.04%.&#13;
The buoyancy coefficients for import duties (1.59), excise duties (1.04) and&#13;
the sales tax (1.13) also reflect the greater sensitivity of import revenues&#13;
to GNP growth. The higher coefficient for the sales tax than for excise&#13;
duties is due to the faster growth of import revenues; the sales tax revenue&#13;
from domestic production, in fact, fell as a percentage of GNP, from 0.237. in&#13;
FY73 to 0.17% in FY82. Thus, excise duties and the sales tax on domestic&#13;
production have both contributed to the low responsiveness of tax receipts&#13;
from domestic production to GNP.&#13;

1/ The buoyancy coefficient relates tax revenues to GNP without distinguish-&#13;
ing between the growth of revenues due to higher national income and that&#13;
due to changes in the tax structure (e.g., tax rates, coverage, etc.).&#13;
It overstates the income elasticity of tax revenues, which measures the&#13;
response of tax revenues to changes in GNP under a given tax structure.&#13;
The buoyancy coefficient for total tax revenues of 1.1 confirms the low&#13;
elasticity of tax revenues in Pakistan.&#13;

4.34    Most studiesl/ have attributed the limited sensitivity of Pakistan's&#13;
tax revenues to the growth of GNP to one or more of the following factors:&#13;
(i) exclusion of agricultural income from income tax; (ii) prevalence of a&#13;
wide range of exemptions and allowances under income tax; (iii) administra-&#13;
tive difficulties of assessing certain types of income; (iv) a heavy reliance&#13;
on specific rates in the excise tax structure; and (v) restricted coverage of&#13;
the sales tax. The first factor has probably not been important, and the&#13;
second factor is now less important. The extension of the tax net to&#13;
agricultural income, while highly desirable from many viewpoints, would&#13;
broaden the tax base but is unlikely to increase the revenue elasticity given&#13;
the practical problems of measuring agricultural income. Pakistan's income&#13;

tax used to be characterized by excessive exemptions and allowances, but this&#13;
is no longer true. The experience with the self-assessment scheme for income&#13;
tax has clearly demonstrated the importance of improved administration in&#13;
raising tax elasticity. The last two factors ((iv) and (v)) must have&#13;
depressed the growth of revenues from domestic production. These considera-&#13;
tions would seem to point to the wide use of specific rates of excise duty,&#13;
the narrow base of taxes on domestic production, and tax administration as&#13;
the main explanation for the low elasticity of the tax system.&#13;

Revenue Possibilities and Effective Protection&#13;
4.35    Since indirect taxes with protective effects are significant in&#13;
Pakistan, revenue proposals must take account of their protective effects.&#13;
For this purpose, it is the effective rather than nominal protection that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-&#13;
matters. 1/ In the past, it was not possible to take account of the protec-&#13;
tive effects of various taxes on imports and domestic production in a sys-&#13;
tematic way. Now that estimates for the structure of effective protection in&#13;
manufacturing are available, the desired structure of effective protection&#13;
could provide a useful guide for the evolution of indirect taxes.&#13;
4.36    The implications of the various tax arrangements in Pakistan for&#13;
effective protection2/ may be summarized as follows:&#13;
(i) Import duties on final goods increase effective protection for&#13;
those goods. Since nominal protection is increased, effective&#13;
protection also increases.&#13;
(ii)  Import duties on inputs (intermediate and capital goods)&#13;
increase effective protection for those industries, but reduce&#13;
effective protection for using industries. Effective protection&#13;
for using industries is reduced because their costs of produc-&#13;
tion increase.&#13;
1/  The effective rate of protection (ERP) differs from the nominal rate of&#13;
protection in two main ways: it takes account of taxes on inputs, and it&#13;
is calculated with reference to value-added rather than price. ERP for a&#13;
good whose production requires one imported manufactured input is defined&#13;
as:&#13;
ERP = r - at x 100               (1)&#13;
1 -a&#13;
where r = rate of import duty on the good;&#13;
t = rate of import duty on the input; and&#13;
a = the relative share of the cost of the input in the price&#13;
of the good (where both prices exclude import duties).&#13;
Note that 1 - a gives the value-added in the production of the good.&#13;
This formulation can be generalized to include many inputs, and excise and&#13;
sales taxes. See W.M. Corden, The Theory of Protection (London: Oxford&#13;
University Press, 1971), Chapter 3.&#13;
2/ Since quantitative restrictions on imports are important in Pakistan,&#13;
statements relating to taxes on imports made in this paragraph are only&#13;
valid if such taxes rather than quotas determine domestic prices. If the&#13;
margin between the domestic price and the tax-paid import price produced&#13;
by a quota is greater than the import tax, it is the quota that sets the&#13;
domestic price. In this case, the import tax is redundant from the point&#13;
of view of the domestic price and the volume of imports; the only task&#13;
that the import tax performs is that of transferring part of the quota&#13;
profits from importers to Government revenues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-60-&#13;
(iii) Exemption of import duties on inputs increases effective protec-&#13;
tion for industries using those inputs.&#13;
(iv) Excises on final goods reduce effective protection for those&#13;
goods. Since nominal protection is reduced, effective protec-&#13;
tion also declines.&#13;
(v) Excises on inputs reduce effective protection for those&#13;
industries, but do not affect effective protection in using&#13;
industries. The effect on using industries needs clarification.&#13;
Effective protection for using industries is not reduced because&#13;
the input can be purchased at its import price plus tariff&#13;
(provided its import is not banned).&#13;
(vi) Sales taxes on final goods affect effective protection for those&#13;
goods. Since sales tax rates on domestic production and imports&#13;
are unequal, nominal protection is affected; hence, effective&#13;
protection changes.&#13;
(vii) Sales taxes on raw materials and components affect effective&#13;
protection for those industries, since the rates of tax on&#13;
domestic and imported goods are different. Hlowever, the rate of&#13;
effective protection for the final goods is not affected, since&#13;
the mode of operation of the sales tax ensures that using&#13;
industries do not pay sales taxes on raw materials and com-&#13;
ponents.l/&#13;
(viii) Sales taxes on machinery increase effective protection for the&#13;
manufacture of machinery. Since domestic machinery is exempt&#13;
from sales taxes, sales taxes on machinery increase nominal&#13;
protection; hence, effective protection increases.&#13;
(ix) Sales taxes on machinery decrease effective protection for using&#13;
industries. Since sales taxes on machinery cannot be set off&#13;
against sales taxes on finished products, the cost of production&#13;
of using industries increases; hence, effective protection&#13;
declines.&#13;
4.37    The relationship between protection and revenue is straightforward.&#13;
Lower protection does not mean lower revenues if there are no insuperable&#13;
difficulties in taxing domestic production. In this instance, the loss of&#13;
revenues due to a lowering of import duties could be made up by imposing&#13;
1/ This is not true when taxable goods are used to manufacture goods that are&#13;
not subject to tax. See Annex II, paragraph 23.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-&#13;
internal revenue taxes (that is, taxes that apply to domestic production as&#13;
well as imports). It follows that lower protection is not inconsistent with&#13;
higher revenues from indirect taxes provided broad-based internal revenue&#13;
taxes can be developed.&#13;
4.38    If, in the light of the study on effective protection, it is desired&#13;
to lower the levels and variability of the effective rates of protection,&#13;
what would be the kind of tax changes needed, and what would be the broad&#13;
revenue implications? The main measures that would be indicated are: (i)&#13;
lower import duties; (ii) reduction of disparity in import duty rates on&#13;
various goods; (iii) imposition of import duties on most items of machinery&#13;
and intermediate goods; (iv) elimination of the present exemptions of import&#13;
duties on machinery and intermediate goods for selected industries; and (v)&#13;
higher excises. Item (i) is likely to result in lower revenues, and this is&#13;
also probably true of (ii); on the other hand, (iii)-(v) are likely to raise&#13;
revenues.l/ The sales tax would continue to be available for revenue pur-&#13;
poses.&#13;
4.39    Moreover, rationalization of the tariff structure in Pakistan should&#13;
provide an important alternative means of raising revenues. Import&#13;
liberalization must form a key element in tariff reform in view of the find-&#13;
ing of the study on effective protection that, in most industries, quantita-&#13;
tive restrictions are a more important source of protection than tariffs.&#13;
The gradual replacement of import restrictions by tariffs can, therefore, be&#13;
expected to have a significant effect on revenues.&#13;
4.40    There is no concensus among economists on the tax treatment of&#13;
machinery and intermediate goods. The retention of import duties on&#13;
machinery, raw materials and components and the discontinuance of selective&#13;
exemptions from such duties are recommended here for reasons of industrial&#13;
efficiency. Relatively high rates of effective protection on final goods,&#13;
coupled with the exemption of machinery and intermediate goods from import&#13;
duties, would tend to bias the industrial structure toward the production of&#13;
final goods; this would be undesirable. The suggested approach would also&#13;
deal with the problem created by the selective exemption of import duties on&#13;
machinery and other inputs (see paragraph 4.8).2/ In addition, when the&#13;
tariff structure is formulated within the framework of the concept of effec-&#13;
tive protection, duties on machinery and intermediate goods would not matter&#13;
1/ Stronger statements would require a careful consideration of substitution&#13;
possibilities in production and consumption.&#13;
2/ If most concessions for imported intermediate and capital goods were&#13;
eliminated, the regional incentives would need to be restructured.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62-&#13;
for using industries, since the calculations of rates of effective protection&#13;
for using industries would take account of such duties.l/&#13;
4.41    In sum, the broad tax strategy that emerges in the context of effec-&#13;
tive protection is not too different from the present policy, although the&#13;
relative roles of import, excise and sales taxes in the taxation of&#13;
individual commodities would change significantly. The major changes in the&#13;
present policy that are suggested are a different treatment of intermediate&#13;
and capital goods, and a greater role for taxes on domestic production. The&#13;
main advantage of the concept of effective protection is that it facilitates&#13;
a systematic consideration of protective effects of revenue measures. This&#13;
is invaluable in a country striving simultaneously to improve tax revenues&#13;
and to rationalize the structure of industrial incentives.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
4.42    The main priorities in the reform of indirect taxation are (i) a&#13;
significant expansion in the scope of taxes on domestic production; and (ii)&#13;
the development of a broad-based internal revenue tax free of protective&#13;
effects. In addition, price controls that seriously restrict the growth of&#13;
revenues, particularly from excise duties, should be avoided. The two objec-&#13;
tives above could be achieved by the introduction of a sales tax along the&#13;
lines indicated. Indeed, the main implication of the analysis contained in&#13;
this chapter is that the early introduction of such a tax is needed to raise&#13;
revenues, weaken the nexus between revenues and protection, and improve the&#13;
elasticity of the tax system. Sales tax reform should be coordinated with&#13;
the restructuring of industrial incentives.&#13;
4.43    Appropriate reform of direct as well as indirect taxation would be&#13;
facilitated by a greater emphasis on the collection of tax statistics and&#13;
empirical research on fiscal issues. In the past, lack of data has severely&#13;
hampered careful study of the economic and equity effects of Pakistan's tax&#13;
system. Recent initiatives to improve statistics and empirical research&#13;
relating to taxation are therefore welcome and need to be continued. The&#13;
computerization of income tax statistics, the latest household budget survey&#13;
and the study on effective protection will help to remove some of the more&#13;
serious gaps in knowledge concerning the likely economic effects of the tax&#13;
system. The Bank-sponsored research on the effective rates of tax (tax rates&#13;
on final goods that take account of taxes paid on inputs used in their&#13;
manufacture) should also correct a major deficiency. In a country like&#13;

and capital goods is well known and need not be discussed here. See,&#13;

Pakistan, where revenues from imported intermediate and capital goods are&#13;
important, calculations of effective rates of tax are necessary for a proper&#13;
assessment of the economic and equityl/ effects of the tax system.&#13;
1/  Satisfactory analysis of incidence of taxation in Pakistan has been&#13;
hampered in the past by the difficulty of imputing taxes paid on&#13;
imported inputs and machinery to final products. A recent study on&#13;
incidence, which ignores import duties, is Talat Alaudin and Bilquees Raza,&#13;
Tax Progressivity in Pakistan (Islamabad: Pakistan Institute of&#13;
Development Economics, October 1981). The study found the incidence of&#13;
excise and sales taxes combined to be more or less proportional.&#13;

5. PERSONAL SAVING&#13;
5.1     Household saving behavior depends on a number of complex economic&#13;
and non-economic factors. Social attitudes may be an important determinant&#13;
of saving in Pakistan. Among the economic factors, the availability of&#13;
suitable savings facilities, the structure of returns and institutional&#13;
factors, both tax and non-tax, are important. This chapter reviews the&#13;
structure of real after-tax returns on deposits, aspects of savings&#13;
facilities in rural areas, and possibilities for enlarging the scope for&#13;
saving through retirement schemes.&#13;
Composition of Financial Assets&#13;
5.2     A comprehensive picture of household assets cannot be given because&#13;
details of household wealth in the form of non-financial assets (such as land&#13;
and buildings, capital goods and inventories, durable consumer goods and gold&#13;
and jewelry) are not available.   Such assets normally account for the greater&#13;
part of household wealth. However, the importance of deposits in the hold-&#13;
ings of financial assets by households is striking (Table 5.1).l/ The bulk&#13;
of savings deposits and a large proportion of fixed deposits with commercial&#13;
banks are held by individuals.   Individual holdings also dominate national&#13;
savings schemes, which qualify for tax benefits. Deposits with NDFC do not&#13;
attract tax advantages, and are held mainly by institutions. The next main&#13;
category of assets, government bonds, yield lower returns than comparable&#13;
assets, and are predominantly held by the banking system. With only a small&#13;
proportion of listed companies declaring dividends and a meager supply of new&#13;
issues (which attract the investment allowance), stock exchange securities&#13;
have failed to attract much interest; equities (held directly, or indirectly&#13;
through the NIT unit trust and ICP mutual funds) have remained unimportant&#13;
relatively to deposits. The insurance habit has yet to take root, and life&#13;
insurance as a medium of saving is insignificant.2/ With the country's only&#13;
housing finance institution, the House Building Finance Corporation, relying&#13;
exclusively on the Government for its resources, there has been no mobi-&#13;
lization of deposits for housing. Saving through provident and pension&#13;
schemes is more important than the table indicates, but complete details of&#13;
investments of these schemes are not available at present.&#13;
1/  The data in Table 5.1 include the public sector (e.g., government&#13;
deposits) and are subject to double-counting (e.g., NIT's equity holdings&#13;
are included under both the investments of NIT and the market value of&#13;
shares on the stock exchange). Also, no attempt has been made to distin-&#13;
guish between personal and private savings. These factors do not affect&#13;
the conclusions drawn here.&#13;
2/ There were only 413,000 ordinary life and 2.6 million group life policies&#13;
in force in 1980.&#13;

5.3     An aspect of the composition of households' financial assets that&#13;
stands out is the limited importance of assets which are normally associated&#13;
with the provision of long term finance to industry. Overall, households&#13;
seem to have a preference for relatively short term financial assets. A&#13;
large proportion of savings accounts are probably used as current accounts.&#13;
While about a third of fixed deposits have a term of over three years, and&#13;
defense savings certificates and national deposit certificates have maximum&#13;
terms of ten and seven years, respectively, the most popular national saving&#13;
instrument - the Khas depositl/ - has a maximum term of only three years. As&#13;
already explained, equities, unit and mutual funds, and life insurance play a&#13;
limited role, and this is probably also true of private provident and pension&#13;
funds.&#13;
5.4     Measures that would encourage greater diversification of the finan-&#13;
cial investments held by households would be desirable. Although tax relief&#13;
for saving through retirement schemes, equities and life insurance is at a&#13;
sufficiently high level, changes of other kinds need to be considered.&#13;
Initiatives to raise saving through contributory provident schemes, for&#13;
instance, would be helpful. The returns on different types of deposits and&#13;
the tax treatment of these returns are also of crucial importance in promot-&#13;
ing and diversifying savings.&#13;
Structure of Returns on Deposits&#13;
5.5     The commercial banks and the Directorate of National Savings,2/&#13;
between them, provide a variety of deposit facilities, with widely varying&#13;
returns. Nominal rates of return after the payment of zakat range from 6% on&#13;
bank savings deposits to 15.3% for the national savings schemes' 10-year&#13;
defense certificate (Table 5.2). For deposits of under three years, the&#13;
return on Khas deposits, which yield about 15% before zakat and 12.5% after&#13;
zakat, dominate all other returns. For 5-year deposits, the after-zakat&#13;
returns vary from 10.25% on fixed deposits with commercial banks to 13.71% on&#13;
national deposit certificates. Returns on bank deposits are generally lower&#13;
than on comparable assets under national savings schemes.&#13;
5.6     Tax provisions also favor national savings schemes.    All interest&#13;
from national savings instruments is exempt from income tax. Defense savings&#13;
certificates receive further relief by way of the investment allowance. By&#13;
1/ Khas deposits have a term of three years, but are encashable at any time&#13;
after issue. The return for each of the first five complete periods of&#13;
six months is at the rate of 15% per annum, while that for the last&#13;
complete period of six months is at the rate of 17% per annum.&#13;
2/ The Government's national savings schemes are operated by the Directorate&#13;
of National Savings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-67-&#13;
contrast, the only accounts with commercial banks that receive tax relief are&#13;
PLS accounts, which qualify for the dividend exclusion.l/ These provisions&#13;
have made the bank savings and fixed term accounts, the accounts through&#13;
which the commercial banks raise the greater proportion of deposits, rela-&#13;
tively unattractive.&#13;
1/ Dividends of up to Rs 15,000 from certain sources are exempt from income&#13;
tax. See Annex I, paragraph 19.&#13;

5.7     Since returns from bank deposits are lower and taxable, a wide spread&#13;
of interest rates has emerged. Thus, while a saving deposit yields 6% (after&#13;
zakat but before income tax), a 3-year defense savings certificate (for a&#13;
person receiving the investment allowance at the rate of 20%) yields 19.5%&#13;
(after both zakat and income tax).   To reduce this wide .ltspersion, the&#13;
exemption of interest from income tax should be extended to all interest&#13;
income up to a specified amount, irrespective of its source. Although PLS&#13;
deposits embody an element of risk, they are closer to bank deposits than to&#13;
equities and should also be brought within the scope of such an exemption.&#13;
Consideration should also be given to devising a desired structure of inter-&#13;
est rates without granting the investment allowance to defense savings&#13;
certificates; the present returns on defense savings certificates are out of&#13;
line with returns from economic activities.&#13;
5.8     The present disparities in the structure of returns on savings&#13;
instruments are accentuated by wide year-to-year variations in the rate of&#13;
inflation. In FY82, with inflation around 10%, the real after-tax returns on&#13;
national savings schemes ranged from -2.5% to 5.3% (ignoring the investment&#13;
allowance), while the maximum real return on fixed deposits (after zakat but&#13;
before income tax) with commercial banks was zero and the return on savings&#13;
deposits was substantially negative. With the rate of inflation declining to&#13;
5-8% in FY83, the returns on some national savings instruments may be too&#13;
high, but the returns on most commercial bank deposits, and especially on&#13;
savings deposits, remain unattractive.&#13;
5.9     Since the rural population has a closer contact with the banking&#13;
system than with other financial institutions, availability of bank deposits&#13;
with reasonable real after-tax returns would facilitate the mobilization of&#13;
rural savings. However, the ability of the banks to provide more attractive&#13;
savings facilities will depend on their ability to earn better returns on&#13;
their assets, especially on government securities and long-term loans.    The&#13;
current yield on recent issues of long-term government securities is&#13;
11.5-11.75%. The rate of interest on loans for investment in industry and&#13;
agriculture is fixed by the Government at 11% compared to a minimum rate of&#13;
14% for working capital and most other purposes. An increasing use of par-&#13;
ticipation term certificates (equity-type fixed term lending), the returns on&#13;
which are uncontrolled and have exceeded 15%, would help to improve returns&#13;
on the banks' assets.&#13;
5.10    The policy changes discussed above would have implications for the&#13;
budget. Rates of interest on government securities that are more in line&#13;
with market rates would increase interest charges (thereby reducing govern-&#13;
ment saving), while a lower gap between the yields on bank deposits and&#13;
national savings schemes would tend to reduce the flow of resources to the&#13;
budget through these schemes. These considerations, however, should not be&#13;
allowed to detract from the importance of improving savings facilities in&#13;
rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-70-&#13;
Rural Savings&#13;
5.11    The problem of rural savings has not been adequately studied in&#13;
Pakistan. A lower per capita income and a greater incidence of poverty than&#13;
in urban areas have frequently been considered as the main factors constrain-&#13;
ing the capacity of rural households to save.1/ Little attention has been&#13;
given to the fact that the rural population has been the miain beneficiary&#13;
of the migrants' remittances (currently amounting to over US$2 billion&#13;
annually), and that some segments of the rural population have benefited&#13;
substantially from higher public investments in agriculture, a greater flow&#13;
of concessionary agricultural credit, and more remunerative prices for major&#13;
crops.&#13;
5.12    Mobilization of resources in rural areas does not seem to have kept&#13;
pace with the growth in rural incomes. Financial assets still play a&#13;
peripheral role in the wealth of rural households. According to a recent&#13;
study on migrants' remittances, for instance, about 22% of the receipts were&#13;
diverted to real estate and 11.5% to agricultural and comnaercial investments,&#13;
compared to 1.5% channelled into financial assets.2/&#13;
5.13    Physical access to savings facilities is a major problem in rural&#13;
areas. For about 70% of villages, the nearest bank is more than four&#13;
kilometers away; for about 50% of villages, the nearest post office is a&#13;
similar distance.3/ Poor transportation facilities further aggravate the&#13;
problems of accessibility. However, within the overall constraint imposed by&#13;
the availability of infrastructure, commercial banks, post offices and&#13;
national savings centers provide a wide coverage of saving facilities.&#13;
5.14    Commercial banks dominate all other financial institutions in the&#13;
mobilization of savings in rural areas. The commercial banking network&#13;
consists of about 7,000 branches, of which about 5,000 are located outside&#13;
the larger cities. The latter account for nearly one half of the total&#13;
deposit liabilities of commercial banks of about Rs 80 billion. The bulk of&#13;

the deposits at the branches outside the larger cities are held in the form&#13;
of about seven million savings and term deposits accounts.1/ While overstat-&#13;
ing the importance of rural areas as a source of deposits,2/ these statistics&#13;
nonetheless bring out the significant role of the banking system in resource&#13;
mobilization in rural areas.&#13;
5.15    The importance of commercial banks in rural areas also emerges from a&#13;
consideration of savings deposits. About Rs 40 billion is held as savings&#13;
deposits in 14 million accounts. If it were assumed that every urban&#13;
household has one savings account, the total number of savings accounts would&#13;
suggest that every rural household has also a savings account (given the&#13;
average household size in Pakistan of about six persons). This certainly&#13;
overstates the spread of the banking habit in rural areas. However, even the&#13;
assumption that every urban household has two savings accounts would suggest&#13;
that about half of rural households maintain a savings account and that the&#13;
commercial banking system is a significant medium of mass saving in Pakistan.&#13;
5.16    In terms of coverage, post offices have an advantage over both com-&#13;
mercial banks and national savings centers. Of the 8,860 post offices&#13;
located in rural areas, about 7,200 undertake savings bank work. With their&#13;
main function being the delivery of mail, however, the post offices have&#13;
attached secondary importance to the mobilization of savings. The rural post&#13;
offices mobilize an estimated Rs 2 billion through 400,000 accounts. Not-&#13;
withstanding the relatively low level of deposits mobilized by post offices&#13;
in rural areas, the post offices provide a valuable service by extending&#13;
saving facilities to areas not served by commercial banks and national&#13;
savings centers.&#13;
5.17    Although national savings centers have attracted growing deposits,&#13;
their success in mobilizing savings in rural areas has been very modest. A&#13;
narrow coverage of their facilities, and the use of instruments that are more&#13;
likely to appeal to sophisticated investors than to a rural population with&#13;
low literacy may be the main reasons for this. Though about half of the&#13;
national savings centers are located at the tehsil (sub-district) level,3/&#13;
their savings facilities are virtually inaccessible at the village level,&#13;
1/ Based on statistics provided by the Pakistan Banking Council.&#13;
2/ If a stricter definition of rural areas were adopted, the deposits&#13;
attracted by rural branches would be lower. The number of branches in&#13;
centers with populations of under 50,000 persons is about 3,340. See&#13;
Growth of Pakistani Banking (Karachi: Research and Planning Division,&#13;
Muslim Commercial Bank Limited, 1982).&#13;
3/ Strictly, some of these cannot be regarded as rural centers. However,&#13;
tehsil centers are expected to provide savings facilities to a large&#13;
number of surrounding villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72-&#13;
since there are only about 300 national savings centers in total.l/ The&#13;
minor role of national savings schemes in rural areas is demonstrated by the&#13;
fact that only about 8,800 out of a total of about 67,460 Khas deposit&#13;
accounts, the most popular of all national savings instruments, originate in&#13;
rural areas. In terms of amounts, rough estimates suggest that only Rs 200&#13;
million of the new deposits attracted by national savings centers in FY82 may&#13;
have come from rural areas.&#13;
5.18    The combination of lending facilities with deposit mobilization gives&#13;
commercial banks a considerable advantage over post offices and national&#13;
savings centers. Given a limited supply of credit from other financial&#13;
institutions, and a growing involvement of commercial banks in agricultural&#13;
lending, the attractiveness of an account with a bank has increased. Commer-&#13;
cial banks now account for nearly one half of the institutional credit to&#13;
agriculture.2/&#13;
5.19    Better access to savings facilities and availability of suitable&#13;
savings instruments seem necessary for stimulating rural savings. Improve-&#13;
ments in rural transportation would probably have a higher impact on the&#13;
coverage of savings facilities than any other measure, but greater use of&#13;
mobile units could help a great deal. While all three institutions have a&#13;
role to play in the mobilization of savings, the predominance of the banking&#13;
system in the mobilization of rural deposits underscores the importance of&#13;
enabling commercial banks to provide diversified savings instruments with&#13;
reasonable real returns.&#13;
1/ National savings instruments may also be purchased from post offices and&#13;
banks. Banks cannot, however, be expected to push competing instruments.&#13;
Of the outstanding amount of national savings deposits (excluding prize&#13;
bonds) of Rs 15,260 million as of October 31, 1982, Rs 9,190 million were&#13;
raised by national savings centers, Rs 4,160 million by commercial banks,&#13;
and Rs 1,910 million by post offices (Source: State Bank of Pakistan&#13;
Bulletin, January 1983).&#13;

5.20    Inculcation of the savings habit clearly constitutes the main problem&#13;
in connection with rural savings. Measures to improve the access to, and the&#13;
attractiveness of, rural savings facilities may not, by themselves, be suffi-&#13;
cient to modify deeply entrenched social attitudes. However, such measures,&#13;
together with aggressive and prolonged savings campaigns (in contrast to the&#13;
brief campaigns that are being held from time to time) would be essential&#13;
ingredients of any strategy for transforming the rural population's attitude&#13;
toward thrift.&#13;
Saving through Retirement Schemes&#13;
5.21    Saving through contributions to pension and provident schemes is&#13;
important in developed countries. Compulsory national provident schemes for&#13;
those in wage and salary employment have also helped to raise saving for&#13;
retirement in many developing countries. This section reviews existing&#13;
schemes in the public and private sectors in Pakistan with a view to arriving&#13;
at broad conclusions for future policy.&#13;
5.22    The Federal and Provincial Governments provide similar pension and&#13;
provident schemes for their employees. The pension scheme is&#13;
non-contributory. Civil servants with a qualifying service of five years&#13;
and above but less than 10 years receive a gratuity (in lieu of a pension)&#13;
at the rate of one month's salary for each year of service. Those with a&#13;
qualifying service of 10 years or more receive a pension calculated with&#13;
reference to the length of employment and average emoluments over the last 12&#13;
months of employment. Broadly, up to 50% of the gross pension may be com-&#13;
muted into a lump sum on retirement.&#13;
5.23    All civil servants must compulsorily join the Government Provident&#13;
Fund after two years of service. The fund is strictly a compulsory savings&#13;
scheme rather than a provident scheme, since only the employees contribute;&#13;
the Governments do not supplement the employees' contributions. The rates of&#13;
monthly contributions range from 6% on monthly salaries of up to Rs 500, to&#13;
12% on salaries above Rs 1,000. The rate of interest on contributions, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-74-&#13;
is determined annually, is currently 13.2%. Provisions exist for the grant-&#13;
ing of advances from the fund, and for an early withdrawal of balances.l/&#13;
The accumulated balance in the fund is not represented by investments;&#13;
instead the annual contributions and disbursements are reflected in the&#13;
Governments' development budgets. In FY82, the contributions to and payments&#13;
from the Government Provident Fund for federal employees amounted to Rs 415&#13;
million and Rs 165 million, respectively.2/&#13;
5.24    Most public enterprises have provident fund and gratuity schemes for&#13;
their employees; employers contribute to provident funds at the same rate as&#13;
employees. In commercial banks, membership of pension plans was recently&#13;
made compulsory for new employees, while existing employees had the option to&#13;
continue with their provident fund and gratuity benefits.&#13;
5.25    The coverage of retirement schemes in the private sector is not as&#13;
wide as in the public sector. There is no statutory requirement for the&#13;
establishment of provident funds by employers, but fLrms of a certain size&#13;
that do not have provident fund schemes are required to pay gratuities to&#13;
employees on their resignation or retirement. Gratuity is payable by commer-&#13;
cial establishments employing 20 or more workers and by industrial estab-&#13;
lishments employing 50 or more workers. The rate of gratuity is 20 days&#13;
wages for every completed year of service. Since there is no statutory&#13;
provision for the setting up of provident funds, gratuities are more common&#13;
than provident funds.&#13;
5.26    A survey of factories with more than 20 employees in 1977 found that&#13;
only 25% of the factories had contributory provident fund schemes, and total&#13;
contributions amounted to a mere Rs 32 million. However, the response to the&#13;
1/ Members may be granted temporary advances for certain purposes (e.g.,&#13;
for expenses incurred in connection with prolonged illness); each such&#13;
advance must not, however, exceed three months' salary or 50% of the&#13;
member's balance, whichever is less. An advance amounting to the lesser&#13;
of two years' salary and 80% of the balance may also be granted for the&#13;
purchase of a house. For a member aged 50 years and above, an advance&#13;
for this purpose may not be recovered but treated as part of the final&#13;
payment of his credit balance. Members are entitled to withdraw 60% of&#13;
the accumulated balance after the age of 50, and 80% of the balance after&#13;
the age of 55. The full amount standing to his credit is payable when a&#13;
member leaves Government employment.&#13;
2/ Recent information concerning contributions of provincial employees is&#13;
not readily available; the net contributions of Provincial Government&#13;
employees to the Government Provident Fund amounted to about Rs 85 million&#13;
in 1976/77.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75-&#13;
survey was low and the finding may be unreliable.l/ The compilation of&#13;
income tax statistics currently underway should give a better picture of the&#13;
scope of provident funds in the private sector. Approved provident funds&#13;
enjoy substantial tax benefits.2/ Since most funds seek these concessions,&#13;
the income tax statistics should provide comprehensive data on contributions&#13;
to private provident funds and, together with details of rules and accounts&#13;
of each fund, information on their net contribution to saving.&#13;
5.27    The coverage of private retirement schemes expanded with the intro-&#13;
duction of the employees' old-age benefits scheme (EOBS) in July 1976. All&#13;
commercial and industrial establishments employing at least 10 persons are&#13;
required to contribute in respect of workers3/ earnings up to Rs 1,000 per&#13;
month; no contributions are required from the employees. The contributions&#13;
are at the rate of 5% of the monthly wage. The Federal and Provincial&#13;
Governments, public corporations and commercial banks are outside the scope&#13;
of the scheme. The main benefit is a pension, payable at the flat rate of&#13;
Rs 75 per month to men (women) over 55 (50) who have retired and in respect&#13;
of whom contributions have been paid for at least 15 years. Contributions&#13;
amounting to Rs 126 million were made in respect of 873,000 members in FY82.&#13;
5.28    Several changes in the EOBS were announced recently. Workers, once&#13;
enrolled in the scheme, are to retain their membership even when their&#13;
monthly earnings exceed Rs 1,000; however, the maximum contribution is to&#13;
remain at Rs 50 per month. Pensions are to be payable after the age of 50&#13;
years irrespective of whether a member has retired. At the same time, the&#13;
qualifying period of 15 years would be reduced to five years for men over 45&#13;
years and women over 40 years. Both the range and the magnitude of benefits&#13;
are also to be increased; benefits would vary from a minimum of Rs 90 to Rs&#13;
345 per month.&#13;
5.29    There are further possibilities for increasing saving through provi-&#13;
dent fund schemes in the private sector. The EOBS, given its partial&#13;

of Pakistan, May 1981).&#13;
2/ The employer's contributions are deductible, the employee's contributions&#13;
qualify for the investment allowance, and the income of the funds and the&#13;
accumulated balances paid to the members are exempt from tax. See&#13;
Annex I, paragraphs 20-22.&#13;
3/ According to the Industrial Relations Ordinance of 1969, a "workman" is&#13;
defined as a person employed by commercial and industrial establishments&#13;
"to do any skilled or unskilled, manual or clerical work for hire or&#13;
reward"; this definition would seem to exclude administrative,&#13;
supervisory and managerial personnel from the scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 6-&#13;
coverage of employees, and with its restriction of contributions to employers&#13;
and the maximum rate of contributions to Rs 50 per month, cannot tap such&#13;
possibilities fully. In addition, retirement schemes should be saving rather&#13;
than welfare-oriented; this requires, inter alia, that employees supplement&#13;
employer contributions, and advances against credit balances be permitted&#13;
only in exceptional circumstances.&#13;
5.30    One possibility is to make statutory provision for the establishment&#13;
of provident funds by all establishments above a certain size. The basic&#13;
features of such funds could be specified, and an institution established to&#13;
manage the funds of establishments that are unable to do so themselves.&#13;
Another possibility is to transform the EOBS into a full-fledged provident&#13;
fund covering all employees of establishments with 10 or more employees and&#13;
requiring contributions from employees as well as employers. Still another&#13;
possibility is to establish a national provident scheme for both private and&#13;
public sector employees. This would have many advantages (e.g., portability&#13;
of provident fund rights, uniform treatment of all employees in similar&#13;
circumstances, etc.), but would necessitate suitable modifications in exist-&#13;
ing public and private retirement schemes. A proper evaluation of the alter-&#13;
natives would require greater data about the existing schemes than are&#13;
presently available. A careful study of the future role of retirement&#13;
schemes is needed.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
5.31    The structure of returns on deposits and the taxation of interest&#13;
income should be reviewed. The present arrangements confer too great an&#13;
advantage on national savings schemes in relation to bank deposits and impede&#13;
the role of commercial banks in resource mobilization. The predominance of&#13;
the banking system in the mobilization of rural deposits underscores the&#13;
importance of enabling commercial banks to provide diversified savings&#13;
instruments with reasonable real returns.&#13;
5.32    The establishment of the employees   old age benefits scheme repre-&#13;
sents an important step toward a broader coverage of retirement schemes.&#13;
While the coverage of retirement schemes in the public sector is good, there&#13;
is further scope for increasing saving through retirement schemes in the&#13;
private sector. A study to review the coverage and working of existing&#13;
private provident funds, and the possibilities for extending the role of&#13;
retirement schemes in household saving is recommended.l/&#13;
1/  The study should also examine which contributions presently made by&#13;
employers could be eliminated or consolidated if more comprehensive&#13;
provident fund arrangements were introduced. Employers contribute in&#13;
respect of their employees for a large number of purposes, including&#13;
medical care (through Provincial Social Security Institutions), group&#13;
life insurance, housing (under the Workers' Welfare Fund Ordinance, 1971)&#13;
and education (through the provincial education cess).&#13;

6. TAXATION AND COMPANY SAVING&#13;
6.1     Taxes affect business saving through their effect on profits avail-&#13;
able for saving and by influencing the choice between retention and distribu-&#13;
tion. This chapter examines whether the present system of company taxation&#13;
is conducive to company saving (retained earnings). This, in turn, involves&#13;
a consideration of the structure of company taxation and the level of the tax&#13;
rate. Specifically, the following questions are asked. First, is the&#13;
present structure of company taxation satisfactory? Second, are the present&#13;
tax rates at a reasonable level? Third, is the differentiation between&#13;
different types of companies, and especially between domestic public com-&#13;
panies and private companies,l/ desirable?&#13;
Present System of Company Taxation 2/&#13;
6.2     Pakistan follows the "classical" system of company taxation.   There&#13;
is complete separation between the individual income tax and company taxes.&#13;
Shareholders receiving dividends cannot claim credit for any taxes paid at&#13;
the company level. Since distributed profits are first subject to company&#13;
taxes and then to the individual income tax, the system gives rise to what&#13;
has been termed "double taxation" of dividends. However, partial relief from&#13;
double taxation is provided by exempting certain amounts of dividends from&#13;
the individual income tax (see paragraph 6.5).&#13;
6.3     The company tax rate structure has three components:   company income&#13;
tax, super tax and a surcharge. All companies are liable to an income tax at&#13;
the rate of 30%. Companies are also subject to a super tax of 25%, but a&#13;
proportion of the tax is rebated to domestic companies that satisfy specified&#13;
conditions. Additionally, a surcharge at the rate of 5% of the income tax&#13;
and super tax payable is levied. Profits from exports of domestically&#13;
manufactured goods are taxed at the rate of 45% of the combined rate of&#13;
income and super taxes otherwise applicable; the reduced rate applies to all&#13;
exports except raw cotton and rice.&#13;
1/ Throughout this chapter, the term "public company" refers to a company&#13;
which is listed on the stock exchange or a company in which at least 50%&#13;
of the shares are held by the Government; all other incorporated&#13;
businesses are considered private companies. This definition is needed&#13;
because for the purposes of tax rates (the first schedule of the Income&#13;
Tax Ordinance, 1979), the definition of public companies differs from that&#13;
given in the Companies Act.&#13;
2/ For a detailed description, see Annex I, paragraphs 23-41.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-78-&#13;
6.4     While the tax rates are uniform for all non-banking companies, the&#13;
system of rebates under the super tax gives rise to differential taxation.&#13;
Public companies and new industrial companies (with fixed assets of below a&#13;
specified level) each qualify for a rebate on super tax of 5%, and food&#13;
processing companies for 10%; public companies with paid-up capital and&#13;
reserves below certain levels receive a further rebate of 5%. Thus, the&#13;
present structure of company taxation, inter alia, favors domestic public&#13;
companies relatively to private companies.   The foregoing structure of taxa-&#13;
tion results in an overall rate of company taxes of 52.5% for most public&#13;
companies and of 57.75% for most private companies.l/&#13;
6.5     Private companies are less favorably treated than public companies in&#13;
two other ways: they are liable to a higher rate of super tax on intercor-&#13;
porate dividends received by them, and the dividend exclusion for their&#13;
shareholders is more limited than for the shareholders of public companies.&#13;
The rate of tax on intercorporate dividends received by public companies is&#13;
10%, compared to the rate of 20% for private companies. In addition, while&#13;
dividends of up to Rs 15,000 received from companies listed on the stock&#13;
exchange are exempt from tax, the exemption is limited to Rs 5,000 for&#13;
dividends received from private companies.2/&#13;
Assessment of the Present System&#13;
6.6     The classical system of company taxation has some widely known&#13;
defects. It results in incorporated businesses being taxed more than unin-&#13;
corporated businesses, dividends being taxed differently than other incomes,&#13;
and debt finance being favored over equity finance. Tax relief for dividends&#13;
does not deal with these defects satisfactorily. The dividend exclusion&#13;
approach pursued in Pakistan, for instance, has two shortcomings. First,&#13;
substantial over-taxation of dividends for low and middle-income groups&#13;
remains, since distributed profits bear a minimum rate of tax of 52.5%, or&#13;
much higher than the likely marginal rates of low and middle-income inves-&#13;
tors. Second, the relatively wealthy taxpayers benefit more, since the value&#13;
of a rupee of tax-exempt dividends is greater the higher the marginal tax&#13;
rate. Many schemes to provide partial relief from the double taxation of the&#13;
distributed portion of company income have been devised, but all of them are&#13;
in some way deficient.&#13;
1/ The tax rates for public and private companies have been arrived at by&#13;
applying a surcharge of 5% to the combined company and super tax rates&#13;
of 50% and 55%, respectively.&#13;
2/ For further details of dividend exclusion, see Annex I, paragraph 19.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-79-&#13;
6.7     An alternative to the classical system of company taxation is the&#13;
"imputation" system. Under the latter, the company tax paid on distributed&#13;
profits is treated as a withholding tax. Shareholders are taxed on gross&#13;
dividends (dividends received plus company taxes paid by companies on those&#13;
dividends) but receive a tax credit equivalent to the company taxes paid; any&#13;
excess of the tax credit over other tax liability is refunded. Under this&#13;
approach, the double taxation of distributed profits is eliminated, since&#13;
dividends are taxed at the taxpayers' relevant marginal rates of tax.&#13;
6.8     The imputation system has some obvious advantages; it reduces the&#13;
disparity between taxes on incorporated and other firms, brings the tax&#13;
treatment of dividends in line with that of interest, and improves horizontal&#13;
equity (since dividends are taxed in the same manner as other income).&#13;
However, it also has some disadvantages; it would weaken the present strong&#13;
inducement for profit retention (since the differential between tax rates on&#13;
retained and distributed profits would narrow), substantially reduce tax&#13;
revenues, and would be more difficult to administer (since the tax withheld&#13;
from dividends at the company level would have to be refunded in certain&#13;
circumstances).&#13;
6.9     Pakistan's nominal rates of company taxes fall at the upper end of&#13;
the rates prevailing in both developed and developing countries; company&#13;
rates in excess of 50% are unusual. Many countries that have high nominal&#13;
rates of company taxes have significantly lower effective rates of company&#13;
taxes (which take account of fiscal incentives under company taxation). This&#13;
does not seem to be true in Pakistan, where the only major fiscal incentives&#13;
available to existing firms are an initial allowance for buildings and&#13;
machinery and, possibly, a tax credit for the balancing, modernization and&#13;
replacement (BMR) of plant and machinery (Table 6.1). New industrial under-&#13;
takings set up outside the country's relatively developed areas face effec-&#13;
tive rates that are substantially below nominal rates, since their profits&#13;
are partially or wholly exempt from company taxes for five years. However,&#13;
since only a small proportion of firms are in a position to utilize these&#13;
incentives, most firms probably face effective rates that are close to&#13;
nominal rates.&#13;

6.10    A tax concession for small companies (not limited to only small&#13;
public and new industrial companies as in Pakistan) features in tax struc-&#13;
tures of many countries, but a distinction between private and public com-&#13;
panies for tax purposes is difficult to justify. The less favorable treat-&#13;
ment of private companies relative to public companies may be meant to induce&#13;
the conversion of the former into the latter. While the preferential treat-&#13;
ment of public companies can be expected to encourage some private companies&#13;
to go public, a wider shareholding would not seem to be necessary or prac-&#13;
ticable for the vast majority of private firms. A major effect of tax dif-&#13;
ferentiation is, therefore, likely to be a distortion in the allocation of&#13;
resources.  To the extent that there is a tendency for the net-of-tax returns&#13;
in different activities to be equalized, capital would move from higher&#13;
productivity uses in private companies to lower productivity applications in&#13;
public companies.&#13;
6.11    Despite the bias imparted by the tax system to retained earnings, it&#13;
is widely believed in Pakistan that the magnitude of company taxation,&#13;
together with large holdings of equities by institutions which have a strong&#13;
preference for dividends, has restricted company saving. In addition, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-81-&#13;
concessional rate of interest on industrial loans from commercial banks is&#13;
thought to have reinforced other considerations favoring a high reliance on&#13;
external finance (as distinct from retained earnings). At first sight, these&#13;
impressions seem to be contradicted by statistics on non-financial companies&#13;
listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange. Table 6.2 gives sources of finance for&#13;
investment by these companies. Retained earnings have clearly been&#13;
important, financing over one half of the companies' capital spending. The&#13;
stock exchange has played a minor role in meeting the companies financial&#13;
requirements; the share of new equity capital in the financing of investment&#13;
fell from 28% in 1976 to about 9% in 1980. Although new issues offered to&#13;
the public have been small, the popularity of rights issues suggests that&#13;
established companies paying good dividends have not found it difficult to&#13;
raise fresh share capital.l/ Finally, long term borrowing provided under one&#13;
third of the financing; with only a few corporate debentures quoted on the&#13;
stock exchange, most long term debt finance came from commercial banks and&#13;
development finance institutions. Overall, equity finance, defined as&#13;
retained earnings plus new share capital, met two thirds of the financing&#13;
requirements despite the present favorable tax treatment of debt finance and&#13;
the concessional rate of interest for long term loans.&#13;
6.12    The financing pattern of listed companies suggests that either busi-&#13;
ness savings were so buoyant that a significant proportion of the financing&#13;
needs could be met from internal sources, or that the level of investment was&#13;
sluggish so that there was no need to raise large amounts of resources from&#13;
external sources.2/ The latter conjecture seems more plausible. The com-&#13;
panies under cons7ideration accounted for only 7.5% of private saving, and&#13;
their investment in 1980 was no higher in real terms than in 1976.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
6.13    Although sufficient evidence is lacking, the level of company saving&#13;
appears to be low in Pakistan. Government policies to revitalize the&#13;
industrial sector should, therefore, consider lower company taxation as a&#13;
means of stimulating company saving as well as investment.&#13;
1/ New issues offered to the public during 1975/76 to 1981/82 varied between&#13;
Rs 18 million to Rs 92 million, except in 1979/80 when they amounted to&#13;
Rs 400 million. Rights issues have been much larger in many years; for&#13;
example, they amounted to Rs 195 million in 1980/81.&#13;
2/ The textile industry may also have significantly influenced the financing&#13;
pattern. See Dr. Abdul Karim, "The Role of Corporate Saving in Pakistan,&#13;
1972-77" in Resource Mobilization in Pakistan (Lahore: Pakistan&#13;
Administrative Staff College, 1981).&#13;

6.14    In view of the desirability of encouraging saving and the substantial&#13;
loss of revenue that a changeover in the system of taxation would entail, the&#13;
replacement of the present system of taxation by the imputation system is not&#13;
recommended. The best way of encouraging company saving may be to con-&#13;
solidate the different taxes on companies into a single tax that is somewhat&#13;
lower than the combined rate of prevailing company taxes. Changes in the&#13;
present rates of tax should be based on a careful review of effective rates&#13;
of tax for different types of companies, data on which should become avail-&#13;
able shortly as a result of the computerization of income tax statistics.&#13;
Double taxation of dividends would be of lesser consequence if the overall&#13;
rate of company taxation were reduced. The merger of different company taxes&#13;
and a reduction in, or elimination of, the differentiation in the tax treat-&#13;
ment of different companies would also help to simplify the present unneces-&#13;
sarily complicated structure of company taxation.&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;
STRUCTURE OF DIRECT TAXES&#13;
Personal and Company Income Taxation&#13;
1.      Personal and company income taxes, zakat and the wealth tax con-&#13;
stitute Pakistan's main direct taxes. This section describes the main fea-&#13;
tures of the individual income tax, tax incentives for saving by individuals&#13;
(investment allowance, the treatment of interest and dividend receipts, and&#13;
retirement schemes), taxation of businesses, and tax incentives for exports&#13;
and investment. The remaining taxes are described in the following sections.&#13;
The relevant legislation is contained in the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, the&#13;
Wealth Tax Act, 1963, the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980, and subsequent&#13;
amendments.&#13;
The Individual Income Tax&#13;
2.      All income is subject to tax unless specifically exempted.    Per-&#13;
quisites (that is, benefits provided by an employer as part of salary) are&#13;
considered part of income, but their valuation is generally below market&#13;
levels.1/&#13;
3.      Main Exemptions.   The major exemption is in respect of agricultural&#13;
income. Additionally, the taxation of capital gains has been suspended up to&#13;
June 30, 1984.&#13;
4.      Treatment of Other Taxes.   Zakat and wealth tax paid are deductible.&#13;
5.      Every taxpayer with a total income of Rs 50,000 and above is required&#13;
to submit a wealth statement along with his return of income. Should the&#13;
combined income tax and wealth tax liability exceed 75% of total income,&#13;
income tax is reduced by the amount by which the combined liability exceeds&#13;
75% of total income. 2/&#13;
6.      Taxable Income.  Taxable income is defined as total income (after the&#13;
deduction of zakat and wealth tax paid) less the standard allowance of Rs&#13;
1/ Details are given in Chapter 3, Table 3.2.&#13;
2/ Note that this does not mean that the combined liability cannot exceed&#13;
75% of total income; it will not exceed 75% of total income only if the&#13;
liability for the wealth tax is below 75% of total income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-84-&#13;
12,000. The income of an assessee's spouse is separately assessed unless it&#13;
is derived from a firm in which the assessee is a partner, or from assets&#13;
transferred by the assessee other than by way of gift or for adequate con-&#13;
sideration.l/&#13;
7.      Tax Rates.   The rates of tax are as follows:&#13;
Taxable Income (Rs)                   Income Tax Payable&#13;
Up to 10,000                          15% of taxable income&#13;
10,000-15,000                         1,500 + 20% of amount exceeding 10,000&#13;
15,000-20,000                         2,500 + 25% of amount exceeding 15,000&#13;
20,000-25,000                         3,750 + 35% of amount exceeding 20,000&#13;
25,000-30,000                         5,500 + 40% of amount exceeding 25,000&#13;
30,000-60,000                         7,500 + 50% of amount exceeding 30,000&#13;
60,000-100,000                        22,500 + 55% of amount exceeding 60,000&#13;
Above 100,000                         44,500 + 60% of amount exceeding 100,000&#13;
8.      The tax liability is determined from the above schedule in conjunc-&#13;
tion with the following provisions:&#13;
(i) Where the salary income comprises more than 50% of total income,&#13;
and the total income does not exceed Rs 21,000, the maximum tax&#13;
liability is restricted to Rs 120; where the total income&#13;
exceeds Rs 21,000, the first Rs 9,000 of taxable income is&#13;
subject to a tax of Rs 120, and the tax payable on the remaining&#13;
taxable income is calculated from the tax schedule. 2/&#13;
(ii) Where non-salary income comprises 50% or more of total income,&#13;
the tax liability computed from the tax schedule is reduced, as&#13;
follows:&#13;
1/ For further details, see the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, sections 69 and&#13;
83.&#13;
2/ Examples may clarify. At the total income of Rs 21,000 (taxable income&#13;
of Rs 9,000), the tax liability is Rs 120, even though the schedule gives&#13;
a liability of Rs 1,350 (15% of Rs 9,000). At the total income of Rs&#13;
25,000 (taxable income of Rs 13,000), the first Rs 9,000 of taxable&#13;
income would be subject to a tax of Rs 120, and the remaining Rs 4,000 of&#13;
taxable income would be taxed at 15%. The tax liability in this instance&#13;
would be Rs 720 (see Table 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-85-&#13;
Total Income (Rs)           Reduction 1/&#13;
12,001-15,000               20% of the amount of tax&#13;
15,001-25,000               15% of the amount of tax&#13;
Above 25,000                Rs 315&#13;
(iii)  Where the total income is between Rs 12,001-13,000, the maximum&#13;
tax liability is restricted to 50% of the excess over Rs 12,000.&#13;
(iv) Where taxable income exceeds Rs 100,000, a surcharge of 10% of&#13;
the income tax payable (after taking account of any rebate for&#13;
investment) is levied.&#13;
9.      The effect of this rate structure is to subject non-salary incomes to&#13;
higher taxation than salary incomes. This will be seen by comparing Tables 1&#13;
and 3. A possible reason for the favorable treatment of salary income may be&#13;
the recognition of the greater opportunities for under-reporting non-salary&#13;
income.&#13;
Tax Relief for Saving&#13;
10.     Tax relief for saving is given through an investment allowance,&#13;
exemption of certain amounts of interest and dividend receipts, and a&#13;
favorable treatment of retirement schemes.&#13;
11.     Investment Allowance.   Tax relief is granted for qualifying invest-&#13;
ments of up to 1/3 of total income, with a maximum of Rs 50,000. The main&#13;
qualifying investments are:&#13;
(i) contributions to a recognized provident fund (up to 20% of&#13;
salary);&#13;
(ii)  contributions t, an approved superannuation fund;&#13;
(iii) life insurance premiums (up to 10% of the capital sum assured);&#13;
(iv) Defense Savings Certificates;&#13;
(v)  unit trust certificates issued by the National Investment Trust&#13;
(NIT);&#13;
1/ An example may clarify. At the total income of Rs 20,000 (taxable income&#13;
of Rs 8,000), the schedule gives the tax liability of Rs 1,200. This sum&#13;
must be reduced by Rs 180 (15% of Rs 1,200) to arrive at the actual tax&#13;
liability of Rs 1,020 (see Table 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-86-&#13;
(vi) mutual fund certifLcates issued by the Investment Corporation of&#13;
Pakistan (ICP);&#13;
(vii) shares of specified Pakistani investment companies;&#13;
(viii) specified debentures of public companies;&#13;
(ix)  participation term certificates;&#13;
tx)  shares of specified Pakistani industrial public companies;&#13;
(xi) modaraba 1/ certificates; and&#13;
(xii) shares of specified holding, investment and industrial public&#13;
companies.&#13;
12.     To qualify for the investment allowance, (vi)-(xii) must not be&#13;
acquired from a previous holder. (iii)-(v) and (vii)-(ix) require a holding&#13;
period of three years to qualify for tax relief; where an asset is sold&#13;
within three years, the amount of tax relief previously granted is recovered.&#13;
13.     The tax relief for investment takes the form of a tax credit (that&#13;
is, a deduction from tax liability). The credit is given at the average rate&#13;
of tax, defined as the tax liability (before the surcharge) divided by total&#13;
income. The details of the calculations are explained in Table 2.&#13;
14.     The effect of the investment allowance will be seen by comparing&#13;
Tables 1 and 2. A salaried person with a total income of Rs 100,000 has a&#13;
tax liability of Rs 33,070. If the same person utilizes the investment&#13;
allowance to the fullest extent by investing Rs 33,333, his tax liability&#13;
would fall to Rs 22,047. Thus, in effect, in this instance, investments&#13;
worth Rs 33,333 were acquired for Rs 22,310 (investment of Rs 33,333 minus&#13;
tax saving of Rs 11,023).&#13;
15.     Treatment of Interest.   Interest from the following sources is&#13;
exempt:&#13;
(i) National Savings or Deposit Certificates (including Defense&#13;
Savings Certificates) issued under the National Saving Schemes;&#13;
and&#13;
1/ A modaraba is a business in which subscribers participate with finance&#13;
and the manager participates with effort and skill. The activities of&#13;
modarabas are restricted to those permitted under the Islamic law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-87-&#13;
(ii) Deposits at the Post Office Savings Banks or National Savings&#13;
Centers under the Nation ' Saving Schemes.&#13;
16.     Interest received from a deposit in a savings account at a commercial&#13;
bank is exempt up to Rs 1,000.&#13;
17.     Interest of up to Rs 5,000 received from the following sources is&#13;
exempt:&#13;
(i) securities of Federal and Provincial Governments;&#13;
(ii) approved debentures; and&#13;
(iii) approved participation term certificates.&#13;
18.     Interest paid to a bank on the amount borrowed for investment in the&#13;
securities of Federal and Provincial Governments or debentures of Pakistani&#13;
companies is deductible from the interest received from such securities.&#13;
19.     Treatment of Dividends.   Dividends of up to Rs 15,000 received from&#13;
the following sources are exempt:&#13;
(i) NIT unit trusts;&#13;
(ii) ICP mutual funds;&#13;
(iii) companies listed on the stock exchange;&#13;
(iv) dividends of up to Rs 5,000 received from unlisted companies;&#13;
(v) modaraba certificates; and&#13;
(vi) profit and loss sharing (PLS) accounts with a bank.&#13;
The Tax Treatment of Retirement Schemes&#13;
20.     Special tax provisions apply to provident and superannuation schemes&#13;
for employees that satisfy specified conditions.l/ Contributions made by&#13;
employers to provident and superannuation schemes are deductible. Contribu-&#13;
tions by employees are treated as part of the investment allowance and&#13;
receive tax relief in the same manner as other investments qualifying for the&#13;
investment allowance (that is, tax rebate is granted at the relevant average&#13;
rate of tax). The tax relief for contributions to provident funds is further&#13;
1/ Different provisions apply to the retirement schemes for persons in&#13;
non-pensionable employment and to the self-employed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-88-&#13;
restricted: contributions by an employee must not exceed 20% of the salary,&#13;
and contributions by an employer above 10% of an employee's salary are&#13;
treated as the latter's income.&#13;
21.     The income of provident and superannuation funds is exempt from tax.&#13;
22.     The accumulated balance in a provident fund received by an employee&#13;
is not taxable. In contrast, pensions are taxable except when received by&#13;
a citizen of Pakistan over the age of 60; however, that part of the pension&#13;
which is commuted into a lump sum is exempt.&#13;
Company Taxation&#13;
23.     In the computation of taxable income, all expenses wholly and&#13;
exclusively incurred in the production of income are allowed, including&#13;
interest on debtl/ and depreciation.&#13;
24.     Depreciation Allowances.   The allowances are given for buildings,&#13;
furniture, and machinery and plant. The deductions relate to original cost,&#13;
and are given on a reducing balance method. The main rates are as follows:&#13;
Factories and workshops                  10%&#13;
Other buildings                           5%&#13;
Furniture                                10%&#13;
Most items of machinery and plant        10%&#13;
Motor vehicles                           20%&#13;
25.     Buildings erected by June 30, 1983, and machinery and plant installed&#13;
by that date qualify for an initial allowance, in addition to the annual&#13;
depreciation allowances.2/ The rate is 10% for buildings and 40% for&#13;
machinery and plant.&#13;
26.     Balancing adjustments are made on the sale of assets.   When the sale&#13;
proceeds exceed the written down value, the excess is treated as income; on&#13;
the other hand, when the sale proceeds are less than the written down value,&#13;
the deficit is deductible. However, in the case of a building, "sale&#13;
1/ Payments in respect of borrowings from a modaraba and participation term&#13;
certificate holders are also allowed.&#13;
2/  Note that an initial allowance increases the depreciation allowance in&#13;
the first year but not total depreciation allowances, which are&#13;
restricted to the original cost of an asset.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-89-&#13;
proceeds" are defined as the lower of the original cost or the market&#13;
price.l/&#13;
27.     Valuation of Inventories.   The legislation does not specify the&#13;
method to be used for the valuation of stock in hand but the following&#13;
methods are permitted: (i) cost, (ii) market, or (iii) cost or market price,&#13;
whichever is lower. However, stock at the beginning and end of an accounting&#13;
period must be valued on the same basis (that is, using the same method).&#13;
28.     The Treatment of Losses.   If the net income is a loss, it may be&#13;
carried forward for up to six successive years.&#13;
29.     Tax Rates.   Company taxation has three components:   income tax, super&#13;
tax and a surcharge. Income tax and super tax are levied on net income&#13;
excluding intercorporate dividends received and bonus shares issued. Certain&#13;
types of domestic companies receive rebates on the super tax payable. Inter-&#13;
corporate dividends and bonus shares are taxed at special rates of super tax;&#13;
they are not subject to income tax. The surcharge is levied on the income&#13;
tax and super tax payable.&#13;
30.     The rates of income and super taxes are uniform for all non-banking&#13;
companies but the system of rebates results in differential taxation. Domes-&#13;
tic companies are treated more favorably than foreign companies, and public&#13;
companies more favorably than private companies. This occurs primarily&#13;
because rebates on super tax are confined to domestic companies, and because&#13;
every non-banking public company receives a rebate of 5% on super tax payable&#13;
(see paragraph 33).&#13;
31.     There is complete separation between the individual income tax and&#13;
company taxes. Shareholders receiving dividends cannot claim credit for any&#13;
taxes paid at the company level but, as already explained, certain amounts of&#13;
dividends received from companies are exempt from the individual income tax.&#13;
32.     The rates of company taxes are:&#13;
Income tax: 30%&#13;
Super tax: Banks 35%&#13;
Other companies 25%&#13;
1/ The effect of this is to exempt capital gains in respect of buildings.&#13;
An asset that is purchased for 100 and in respect of which depreciation&#13;
allowances of 40 have been received has a written down value of 60&#13;
(100-40). Suppose the asset is sold for 150. If the asset were&#13;
machinery, tax would be levied on 90 (150-60); but if it is a building,&#13;
tax would be levied on only 40 (100-60).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-90-&#13;
33.     The rates of rebates on super tax for domestic coupanies are:&#13;
(i)  5% for every public companyl/ other than a bank.&#13;
(ii) 5% for every non-banking public company to which (iii) does not&#13;
apply and if its paid-up capital plus free reserves do not&#13;
exceed Rs 500,000.&#13;
(iii) 5% for every public industrial company2/ if its paid-up capital&#13;
plus free reserves do not exceed Rs 1 million.&#13;
(iv) 5% for every industrial company commencing production between&#13;
July 1, 1975 and June 30, 1983 if the original cost of its fixed&#13;
assets (exclusive of the cost of land) does not exceed Rs 5&#13;
million.&#13;
(v)  10% for food processing companies.&#13;
(vi) 15% for every company on income derived from abroad and brought&#13;
into Pakistan.&#13;
34.     The rates of super tax on intercorporate dividends are:&#13;
public company  5%&#13;
foreign company 15%&#13;
other companies 20%&#13;
35.     The rates of super tax on bonus shares are:3/&#13;
public companies   10%&#13;
other companies    15%&#13;
1/ For the purposes of tax rates, a "public company" is defined as a company&#13;
which is listed on the stock exchange or a company in which at least 50%&#13;
of the shares are held by the Government. For other purposes, the&#13;
relevant definition is that given in the Companies Act.&#13;
2/ The definition of an "industrial company" includes the requirement that&#13;
it employ at least ten persons.&#13;
3/ Companies are exempt from the payment of the tax until June 30, 1983.&#13;
Bonus shares are not taxed in the hands of shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-&#13;
36.     A surcharge of 5% of the income tax and super tax payable is&#13;
levied.l/ At the same time, a rebate based on the ratio of retained income&#13;
to after-tax profits is granted to companies whose free reserves are less&#13;
than 200% of their paid-up capital (300% in the case of banks and other&#13;
financial institutions).2/&#13;
Taxation of Partnerships&#13;
37.     Three types of partnerships are distinguished for tax purposes:&#13;
registered partnerships formed by certain professionals, other registered&#13;
partnerships and unregistered partnerships. The tax treatment of registered&#13;
partnerships is more favorable than that of unregistered partnerships. The&#13;
privilege of registration is intended only for genuine partnerships.&#13;
38.     The net profits of a registered partnership are subject to the super&#13;
tax. In addition, each partner is taxed on his total taxable income (includ-&#13;
ing his share of partnership profits3/) at standard individual income tax&#13;
rates. The rates of super tax for registered firms are as follows:&#13;
1/ Note that since the surcharge is related to the combined rate of income&#13;
tax and super tax rather than profits, it raises the combined rate by&#13;
less than 5%. For a company paying tax at the combined rate of 55%, the&#13;
surcharge would raise the overall rate to 57.75% (55 x 1.05).&#13;
2/ The operation of the rebate is best explained through a numerical example.&#13;
Consider the following situation:&#13;
20,000 profits&#13;
11,000 income tax and super tax payable at the rate of 55%&#13;
9,000 profits after income tax and super tax&#13;
3,000 retained profits before the surcharge&#13;
6,000 distributed profits&#13;
If the company did not retain any profits, it would pay the surcharge of&#13;
550 (5% of 11,000). Since the company retained a proportion of profits,&#13;
the liability to the surcharge is reduced by x, calculated as follows:&#13;
3,000 = x&#13;
9,000   550&#13;
Since x = 183 (approximately), the surcharge payable is 367 (550-183).&#13;
3/ Partnership profits are taxed in the hands of a partner net of the super&#13;
tax.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92-&#13;
Total Income (Rs)                      Tax Payable&#13;
Up to 15,000                           Nil&#13;
Above 15,000 but below 30,000          5% of amount in excess of 15,000&#13;
Above 30,000 but below 60,000          750 + 10% of amount exceeding 30,000&#13;
Above 60,000 but below 100,000         3,750 + 20% of amount exceeding 60,000&#13;
Above 10,000                            11,750 + 30% of amount exceeding 100,000&#13;
39.     A registered firm whose income depends wholly or nainly on the&#13;
professional qualifications of its partners, who are prevented by law or&#13;
convention from constituting themselves into a corporate body, is exempt from&#13;
the super tax. The partners (as distinct from the firm) of such a firm are&#13;
taxed in the same manner as the partners of other registered firms.&#13;
40.     An unregistered partnership is treated as a sole proprietorship.l/&#13;
The total taxable income of such a firm is taxed at standard individual&#13;
income tax rates.2/&#13;
41.     All unincorporated firms are subject to a surcharge of 10% of the&#13;
income tax and super tax payable. Unlike individuals, firms with taxable&#13;
incomes of less than Rs 100,000 are also liable to the surcharge.&#13;
Tax Incentives for Investment in Less Developed Areas&#13;
42.     Three main types of incentives are given for investment outside the&#13;
more developed areas.&#13;
43.      Industrial Undertakings Established Outside the More Developed Areas.&#13;
Profits of up to 10% of the capital employed are exempt for five years for&#13;
industries established by June 30, 1983 anywhere in Pakistan excluding the&#13;
talukas of Karachi and Hyderabad and tehsils of Faisalabad and Lahore.&#13;
1/  The tax authorities are empowered to treat an unregistered firm as a&#13;
registered firm if the aggregate amount of tax payable would be greater&#13;
than the aggregate amount that would be payable by the firm and the&#13;
partners individually if the firm were assessed as an unregistered firm.&#13;
It may be advantageous for a firm to remain unregistered if the total&#13;
income of an individual partner is much higher than that of the&#13;
unregistered firm.&#13;
2/  The share of profits received by a partner does not bear further taxation&#13;
in the hands of the partner, but his share is included in his total&#13;
income for computing the average rate of tax applicable to his other&#13;
income (that is, his total taxable income excluding his share of&#13;
profits).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-93-&#13;
44.     Industrial Undertakings Established in Specified Less Developed&#13;
Areas. Profits of an industrial undertaking set up between March 1, 1978 and&#13;
June 30, 1983 in Baluchistan and certain other parts of the country, includ-&#13;
ing areas of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), are exempt for five&#13;
years. A similar exemption applies to an industrial undertaking set up in an&#13;
approved industrial estate in the NWFP, and certain areas of Punjab and Sind.&#13;
45.     Investment in Share Capital of Industrial Companies Set Up in&#13;
Specified Less Developed Areas. Tax credit is available for investment by a&#13;
company in the shares of another Pakistani company established in a specified&#13;
area. The rate of credit is 30% of the amount of investment in Baluchistan&#13;
and certain other areas, and 15% for other specified areas. The credit can&#13;
be carried forward until it is fully set off against tax liability.&#13;
Tax Incentives for Exports&#13;
46.     Tax incentives for exports are of two types, one relating to profits&#13;
from exports of domestically manufactured goods and the other to industries&#13;
established in export zones.&#13;
47.     Profits from Exports of Domestically Manufactured Goods. Export&#13;
profits qualify for a tax rebate of 55% of the amount of income tax and super&#13;
tax payable.l/ The rebate is available in respect of all exports except raw&#13;
cotton and rice.&#13;
48.     Export Zone. Profits from an industrial undertaking set up in an&#13;
export processing zone as well as salaries paid to foreign employees are&#13;
exempt for five years and for such further period as may be approved. Fur-&#13;
thermore, for five years after the expiry of the period of exemption, profits&#13;
are taxed at 25% of the actual rates. The treatment of losses is also more&#13;
liberal than for other enterprises; losses may be carried forward as long as&#13;
required to set them off against profits.&#13;
1/ The tax rebate would reduce the combined rate of income and super tax&#13;
(for a firm that does not qualify for any rebate for super tax) from 55%&#13;
to 24.75%. Allowing for a 5% surcharge, the overall rate would be&#13;
25.99%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-94-&#13;
Tax Credit for Replacement, Balancing and Modernization of Machinery and&#13;
Plant&#13;
49.     Investment by June 30, 1983 in plant and machinery in an industrial&#13;
undertaking for the purpose of balancingi/, modernization and replacement&#13;
(BMR) of machinery and plant qualifies for a tax credit of 15% of the amount&#13;
invested. The credit for BMR may be carried forward for up to two years.&#13;
The Tax Treatment of Income from Housing&#13;
50.     The provisions for housing relate to owner-occupied housing, rental&#13;
housing and housing provided by industrial undertakings for their low-income&#13;
employees (those earning less than Rs 1,000 per month). The net imputed&#13;
income from owner-occupied housing is not taxable, but mortgage interest&#13;
cannot be deducted.&#13;
51.     Tax concessions are provided for rental and industrial housing.&#13;
Income from rental housing constructed by June 30, 1983 and with an annual&#13;
value below Rs 18,000 (Rs 24,000 in the case of Islamabad) is exempt for five&#13;
years; the exemption is restricted to Rs 9,000 where the annual value exceeds&#13;
these limits. Similar provisions apply to income from apartments with annual&#13;
values of under Rs 12,000.&#13;
52.     Industrial housing constructed by June 30, 1983 qtualifies for an&#13;
initial depreciation allowance of 25%, in addition to the annual rate of&#13;
depreciation of 10%.&#13;
1/ The term "balancing" can only be meaningfully defined in relation to&#13;
specific industries. An example of "balancing" in the textile industry&#13;
has been provided by a former chairman of the Central Board of Revenue:&#13;
"The term "balancing" (of machinery) means installation of additional&#13;
machines in an industrial unit for the purposes of achieving optimum&#13;
efficiency of the various inter-related components of that unit. For&#13;
instance, in the textile industry, if an industrial undertaking has both&#13;
yarn-producing and weaving facilities, 25,000 spindles "balance" with 500&#13;
looms... Installation of additional looms or spindles, as the case may&#13;
be, to bring about the right proportion between the two would mean&#13;
"balancing" of the existing machinery." See N.M. Qureshi, "Pakistan's&#13;
Budget for 1980-81 in Perspective - Important Fiscal Measures," Bulletin&#13;
for International Fiscal Documentation, Volume 35, No. 1, January 1981,&#13;

Zakat&#13;
53.     Zakat is a levy on capital payable by Moslem citizens of Pakistan,&#13;
and by firms in which Moslem citizens own the majority of shares. It is&#13;
confined to financial assets; assets not subject to zakat come within the&#13;
purview of the wealth tax. Zakat is compulsorily deducted from specified&#13;
assets; on certain other assets, it is payable voluntarily on a&#13;
self-assessment basis.&#13;
54.     Treatment of Debts.   Debts related to assets subject to the compul-&#13;
sory deduction of zakat are taken into account in determining the value of&#13;
the assets for the purposes of the levy.&#13;
55.     Exemptions.   Zakat is not deducted from savings bank accounts with&#13;
credit balances of Rs 2,000 or less.&#13;
56.     Rate of Deduction.   The rate of deduction for all assets subject to&#13;
zakat is 2.5%.&#13;
57.     Relationship with Other Taxes.   Zakat paid is deductible for income&#13;
tax purposes. Additionally, assets from which zakat has been deducted at&#13;
source are not subject to the wealth tax.&#13;
58.     Assets Subject to the Compulsory Deduction of Zakat.   The chargeable&#13;
amounts for the 11 types of assets subject to the compulsory deduction of the&#13;
levy are determined as follows:&#13;
(i)  Savings bank accounts            Credit balance on the valuation date.&#13;
(ii)  Notice deposits                  Face value or the credit balance on&#13;
the valuation date.&#13;
(iii)  Fixed deposits                   Face value or the credit balance on&#13;
the valuation date.&#13;
(iv)  Savings/Deposit certificates     Value of the certificate on maturityl/&#13;
or encashment, if earlier.&#13;
1/ An example may clarify. A certificate of deposit with a nominal value of&#13;
Rs 100 and the value at maturity of Rs 390 after ten years would be&#13;
subject to zakat in the tenth year on the full maturity value but no&#13;
zakat would be payable in the intervening years. Zakat on life insurance&#13;
policies and provident funds is also payable at maturity or termination&#13;
and not annually.&#13;

value on the valuation date.&#13;
(vii)  Government securitiesl/          Face value on the valuation date.&#13;
(viii)  Shares and debentures of         The lower of the paid-up value or&#13;
companies and corporations       market value on the valuation date.&#13;
(ix)  Annuities                        Annual benefit or surrender value.&#13;
(x)  Life insurance policies          Value at maturity or surrender value.&#13;
(xi)  Provident funds                  Final amount standing to the credit of&#13;
the contributor less employer's contri-&#13;
butions and accrued interest on those&#13;
contributions.2/&#13;
1/ Zakat is not compulsorily deducted from Prize Bonds.&#13;

to those contributions are subject to zakat.&#13;

Wealth Tax&#13;
59.     The wealth tax is an annual levy on net wealth in the form of both&#13;
movable and immovable wealth.   With the introduction of zakat, however, the&#13;
tax has come to fall primarily on real estate.   The wealth tax is largely&#13;
confined to individuals, but firms and partnerships involved in certain types&#13;
of transactions in immovable property are also subject to the tax. All&#13;
assets except those specifically exempted are treated as wealth for the&#13;
purposes of the tax. The liability t-o tax only arises if the values of&#13;
movable and immovable wealth exceed their respective exemption levels.&#13;
60.     Scope.   Individuals and Hindu undivided families are subject to the&#13;
tax in respect of movable as well as immovable property. In addition, firms,&#13;
pa'rtnerships and private companies (but not public companies) are liable to&#13;
the tax in respect of immovable property held for the purposes of the busi-&#13;
ness of construction and sale or renting of property.&#13;
61.     Tax Base.   Subject to the special provisions relating to agricultural&#13;
land and the overall exemption limits discussed below, all assets are taxable&#13;
except the following:&#13;
(i)  growing crops, grass or standing trees on agricultural land;&#13;
(ii)  any building owned or occupied by a cultivator or a receiver of&#13;
rent from agricultural land provided the building is on or in&#13;
the vicinity of the land and is required for use as a dwelling&#13;
house or an out house;&#13;
(iii)  any insurance policy before the sum covered by the policy&#13;
becomes payable;&#13;
(iv)  the right to receive pension or life annuity in respect of past&#13;
employment;&#13;
(v)  the commuted amount of pension;&#13;
(vi)  the amount standing to the credit of a contributor in an&#13;
approved provident fund, and the final payment of the accumu-&#13;
lated balance in such a fund;&#13;
(vii)  furniture, household utensils, clothing and other articles&#13;
(excluding jewelry) intended for personal use;&#13;
(viii)  tools, implements and instruments used in agriculture, and in a&#13;
profession or a vocation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-&#13;
(ix) investment of up to Rs 100,000 in newly issued stocks or shares&#13;
of a public company engaged in an industrial undertaking&#13;
(exempt) for two years; and&#13;
(x) assets in respect of which zakat has been deducted at source.l/&#13;
62.     Immovable properties, other than agricultural land, owned by dif-&#13;
ferent members of a family (husband, wife and their minor children) are&#13;
assessed as if they are owned by a single person.&#13;
63.     The wealth tax is levied on net wealth, defined as the aggregate&#13;
value of all taxable assets less all debts secured on or incurred in relation&#13;
to those assets.&#13;
64.     Special Treatment of Agricultural Land.    There are two special provi-&#13;
sions relating to agricultural land.   First, an individual and a Hindu&#13;
undivided family are exempt from the payment of wealth tax on agricultural&#13;
land if they are not liable to income tax and if no wealth tax would be&#13;
payable by them on their net wealth excluding agricultural land. Second, the&#13;
value of agricultural land up to Rs 100,000 is exempt frori wealth tax.&#13;
65.     Exemptions.   Separate exemption limits (that is, values of net wealth&#13;
below which no taxes are payable) apply to movable and immovable property, as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(i) immovable property (excluding agricultural land) up to Rs&#13;
500,000 or, alternatively, one house used by the taxpayer and&#13;
his family;&#13;
(ii) movable property up to Rs 300,000.&#13;
66.     Valuation.   The rules made under the legislation specify the basis of&#13;
valuation for different types of assets. Some examples of the valuation&#13;
procedures follow.&#13;
1/ Where no distributions of income are made, shares and debentures are not&#13;
subject to the compulsory deduction of zakat. However, in such instan-&#13;
ces, the shares and debentures become subject to the wealth tax.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-&#13;
(i)  securities issued by Government          securities quoted on the stock&#13;
or local authorities                     exchange valued at the quoted&#13;
price; others valued at the&#13;
face value.&#13;
(ii)  shares of joint-stock companies          values of quoted shares taken&#13;
registered in Pakistan                   as the lower of the face value&#13;
or break-up value; value of&#13;
shares not quoted taken as the&#13;
higher of the face value or&#13;
break-up value.&#13;
(iii)  unquoted debentures and prefer-          valued at paid-up value.&#13;
ence shares&#13;
(iv)  rental buildings                          value norrmally arrived at by&#13;
capitalizing gross annual&#13;
rental value over 10 years.&#13;
(v)  agricultural land                        value per acre is taken as 10&#13;
times the produce index unitl/&#13;
of that acre.&#13;
(vi)  plot                                     normally valued at the pur-&#13;
chase price.&#13;
67.     Tax Rates.   The rates of tax are as follows:&#13;
(i)  net wealth in the form of immovable property         2.5%&#13;
(ii)  net wealth in other forms:   on first Rs 300,000     Nil&#13;
next Rs 200,000     0.5%&#13;
next Rs 500,000     1.0%&#13;
next Rs 500,000     1.5%&#13;
next Rs 500,000     2.0%&#13;
remainder           2.5%&#13;
1/ A produce index unit (PIU) is a rough measure of the gross value of&#13;
production per acre.&#13;

ANNEX II&#13;
STRUCTURE OF INDIRECT TAXES&#13;
1.      The major indirect taxes levied in Pakistan comprise import duties,&#13;
excise duties and the sales tax. This annex describes the salient features&#13;
of these taxes. The relevant legislation is contained in the Customs Act,&#13;
1969, the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944, the Sales Tax Act, 1951, and&#13;
subsequent amendments.&#13;
Import Duties&#13;
2.      Tax Base. The tax is levied on the cif import value.&#13;
3.      Coverage. All imported goods are taxable unless specifically&#13;
exempted. The extent of general exemptions (as (listinct from concessions for&#13;
specific purposes) is not wide.&#13;
4.      Tax Rates.   Import duties may be levied at specific or ad valorem&#13;
rates, but most goods are subject to ad valorem rates. Inport duties on&#13;
selected goods are given in Table 1. In addition to the rates specified in&#13;
the import tariff, a surcharge of 5% has been payable, since June 1982, on&#13;
all imports except medicines, printed matter, and accompanied baggage and&#13;
post parcels eligible for exemption from import duties.&#13;
5.      In broad terms, the pattern of import duties is characterized by&#13;
relatively low rates on consumer necessities, raw materials and capital&#13;
goods, and higher rates on final goods, with the highest rates applying to&#13;
consumer durables. The rates on most durable consumer goods are 120% and&#13;
above, with the rates on passenger motor cars varying between 70-350%. The&#13;
rates on textiles range from 70% on yarn to 120% or 200% on fabrics. The&#13;
rates on intermediate goods vary with the stage of production, with finished&#13;
goods being taxed at higher rates than raw materials, and finished consumers'&#13;
goods being taxed at higher rates than finished producers' goods. For&#13;
example, on aluminium and products, the rates rise from 40% on waste and&#13;
scrap to 85% on tubes and pipes, and to 120% on sinks and basins. Most items&#13;
of machinery are taxed at the rate of 40%.&#13;
6.      Treatment of Intermediate Goods. Raw materials and components used&#13;
in certain activities receive a concessional tax treatment. The concessions&#13;
may apply to some or all intermediate goods used in production, and may apply&#13;
to the full extent of the duty or be limited to the duty in excess of a&#13;
specified rate (see Table 2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-105-&#13;
7.      The range of concessions is too diverse to permit generalizations,&#13;
but the following concessions are worth noting:&#13;
(i)  All raw materials and components used in the manufacture of 22&#13;
specified capital goods are exempt from the duties in excess of&#13;
30%.&#13;
(ii)  The duties paid in respect of these capital goods are further&#13;
reduced where the goods are used in certain areas and projects&#13;
for the purposes of balancing, modernization and replacement&#13;
(BMR); in particular, the duty paid on the capital goods used in&#13;
specified less developed areas, and in projects which have been&#13;
exempted from the payment of import duties on the import of&#13;
capital goods is completely refunded.&#13;
(iii)  A concessional treatment at varying rates is granted to com-&#13;
ponents used in the local assembly of tractors and vehicles.&#13;
(iv) Raw materials and components for a wide range of agricultural&#13;
implements, and inputs such as pesticides are partly or wholly&#13;
exempt from the duties.&#13;
8.      Treatment of Machinery.   Import of plant and machinery for certain&#13;
purposes is allowed duty-free or at concessional rates of duty (see Table 2).&#13;
The concessions may be summarized as follows:&#13;
(i)  Complete exemption is granted for the fertilizer, poultry, and&#13;
dairyl/ industries.&#13;
(ii) Complete exemption is granted for plant and nachinery for BMR&#13;
(or for initial installation and BMR) in a number of industries,&#13;
including textiles; the concession for the textile industry is&#13;
only applicable if the machinery is not manufactured locally.&#13;
(iii) Complete or partial exemption is granted for plant and machinery&#13;
for initial installation and BMR used in certain parts of the&#13;
country, the extent of the tax relief depending on whether the&#13;
industry concerned is established in specified less developed&#13;
1/ The concession for the dairy industry only applies if the machinery is&#13;
not manufactured locally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106-&#13;
areas,1/ outside specified more developed areas,2/ or in Govern-&#13;
ment-financed industrial estates.&#13;
(iv) Exemption of duty in excess of 30% is granted for plant and&#13;
machinery imported under the Non-Repatriable Investment Scheme.&#13;
9.      Treatment of Exports.   Import duties paid on raw naterials and com-&#13;
ponents used in the manufacture of exports are either rebated at standardized&#13;
rates (see Table 3) or, where no such rates have been fixed, on the basis of&#13;
documentary evidence.&#13;
10.     In addition, certain export industries are granted compensatory&#13;
rebates at rates varying between 7.5% and 12.5% of the fob value of exports.&#13;
Cotton textiles, engineering goods, canvas footwear, acetate yarn, cutlery,&#13;
sports goods and surgical instruments qualify for these rebates.&#13;
Federal Excise Duties&#13;
11.     Tax Base.  The tax is levied on domestically produced goods and&#13;
services; imports are not subject to the tax.&#13;
12.     Coverage.  The tax applies to 41 commodities, including two services&#13;
(hotels and restaurants, and bank checks).3/&#13;
13.     Tax Rates.  The tax may be levied at a specific rate or an ad valorem&#13;
rate. Ad valorem rates are, in some cases, related to the retail price or&#13;
charge (for services), and in others, to the wholesale cash price. Of the 41&#13;
commodities subject to the tax, 19 are taxed through specific rates and 22&#13;
through ad valorem rates. The tax rates are given in Table 4.&#13;
14.     Treatment of Small-Scale Industry.   Commodities produced in the&#13;
cottage industry sector (see the section on the sales tax for the definition)&#13;
are exempt from the tax.&#13;
1/ Baluchistan, Northern Areas, Azad Kashmir, and parts of the North-West&#13;
Frontier Province, Sind and Punjab.&#13;
2/ The more developed areas comprise tehsils of Rahimyarkhan, Multan,&#13;
Faisalabad, Ferozwala, Lahore, Guiranwala, Rawalpindi and Sialkot,&#13;
talukas of Hyderabad, Kotri and Sukkur, Karachi and Islamabad.&#13;
3/ The number of excisable commodities exceeds the number of commodities on&#13;
which excises are levied; this has no practical significance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107-&#13;
15.     Treatment of Exports.   The excise duty paid on exports is refunded.&#13;
The duty paid on some excisable products used in the manufacture of specified&#13;
exports is rebated at standardized rates (see Table 5).&#13;
The Sales Tax&#13;
16.     Tax Base.  Pakistan's sales tax is a single-stage levy.    It applies&#13;
to imports as well as domestic production, and is collected from manufac-&#13;
turers and importers. The tax base for goods produced in Pakistan is the&#13;
wholesale cash price, and for imports, the import value gross of the import&#13;
duty.l/ For the few goods subject to both excise and sales taxes, the sales&#13;
tax is levied on the price of the product gross of the excise duty.&#13;
17.     Coverage.  A wide range of imported and domestic goods are exempt&#13;
from the sales tax. Though there is some overlap between them, the exemp-&#13;
tions for imports are different from those for domestic goods (see Table 6).&#13;
18.     Aside from the general exemption of specified imports, imported&#13;
intermediate goods used in certain industries are exempt.    An important&#13;
example of this is provided by the capital goods industry: imported raw&#13;
materials and components utilized in the manufacture of 22 specified capital&#13;
goods are exempt from the sales tax (see Table 6).&#13;
19.     Relationship between Excise and Sales Taxes.   Only six commodities&#13;
on which excise duties are levied are subject to the sales tax.    These are:&#13;
paper and paperboard, metal containers, glass and glassware, tyres and tubes,&#13;
wires and cables, and gas appliances.&#13;
20.     Tax Rates.   Domestic and imported goods are taxed at different rates.&#13;
The general rate for domestic goods is 12.5%, but lower rates apply to a few&#13;
goods. The goods that are taxed at lower rates are tyres and tubes, artifi-&#13;
cial leather and rexine, paper and paperboard, and calciuri carbide (10%),&#13;
asbestos waste (7.5%), and certain automobile engine and chassis parts (5%).&#13;
21.     The sales tax on imports is levied at three different rates:    10%,&#13;
20% and 30%. Most consumer goods are taxed at the rate of 10% or 20%; the&#13;
rate of 30% is confined to automobiles, and some consumer durables (see Table&#13;
1). Intermediate and capital goods are taxed mostly at the rate of 10%.&#13;
22.     Treatment of Small-Scale Industry.   All goods produced in the cottage&#13;
industry except footwear, furniture and fixtures, and ready-made garments&#13;
are exempt from the sales tRx. Manufacturing units where the owner is both&#13;

an investor and a worker, employment per shift does not exceed 15 workers,&#13;
and the capital investment does not exceed Rs 100,000 qualify as part of the&#13;
cottage industry. 1/&#13;
23.     Treatment of Intermediate Goods.   Firms producing taxable goods can&#13;
set off sales taxes paid on raw materials and components against their sales&#13;
tax liability on finished goods. However, the sales tax paid on intermediate&#13;
goods used in the manufacture of goods that are not subject to the sales tax&#13;
is not refunded.&#13;
24.     Treatment of Machinery.   The treatment of domestically produced and&#13;
imported machinery is not uniform. All machinery produced in Pakistan is&#13;
exempt from the sales tax, but most items of imported machinery are subject&#13;
to the tax. The sales tax paid on machinery cannot be set off against the&#13;
sales tax liability on final goods.&#13;
25.     Treatment of Exports.   The sales tax is not levied on exports.   The&#13;
sales tax paid on raw materials and components used in the manufacture of&#13;
exports is either rebated at standardized rates (see Table 3) or, where no&#13;
such rates have been fixed, on the basis of documentary evidence.&#13;
1/ The definition of "capital employed" includes borrowed capital and the&#13;
value of rented machinery and fixtures, but does not include investment&#13;
in business premises.&#13;

            Domestic resource mobilization in Pakistan
            : selected issues
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The emphasis of this paper, which is
            confined to federal taxes, is on tax reform with a view to
            raising additional revenues and encouraging household and
            business savings in Pakistan. Taxation is related to the
            three main components of saving - public, personal, and
            business savings, and policies to stimulate national saving
            are more likely to succeed if aimed at all three. Policies
            must also take account of interrelationships among different
            forms of saving. In particular, effects of taxes on personal
            and corporate savings need to be considered. In order to
            improve the overall climate for private saving as well as
            incentives for investment, suitable savings instruments and
            a tax structure that is conducive to company saving are
            critical. In addition, tax policy should be supplemented by
            appropriate policies on user charges, subsidies, and
            self-financing by public enterprises. Agricultural income
            and domestically produced goods are two main areas that have
            been inadequately tapped as yet. Proposed changes in the
            sales tax, excise duties, taxation of petroleum products,
            agricultural taxation, and tax treatment of perquisites, as
            well as import liberalization can be expected to have a
            significant effect on revenues.
