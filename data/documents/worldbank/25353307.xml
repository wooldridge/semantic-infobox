THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 45,545,980&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 1,280&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 108&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 129*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

tells only part of the story, so do changes in that ranking.          This measure shows how far on average an economy is&#13;
Yearly movements in rankings can provide some indication              from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

        On June 27, 2013 the Nairobi City County adopted the new&#13;
        Financial Act 2013 which became effective as of October 1, 2013.&#13;
        The Act modified the method of assessing the building permit&#13;
        fees and consolidated several costs into one. The building&#13;
        permit fee is now based on the size of the building. The Joint&#13;
        Building Council Rates provide the estimated cost per square&#13;
        meter which varies depending on the type of building (e.g. office&#13;
        block, residential, industrial complex, etc.).&#13;

      For the Doing Business case study, the estimated cost is KES&#13;

      The fees are as follows:&#13;
      (i) Building plan approval fee: 1.1% of the estimated cost of&#13;
      construction&#13;
      (ii) Construction sign board fee: KES 25,000&#13;
      (iii) Application fee: KES 5,000&#13;

      Obtain approval of the environmental impact study&#13;
&#13;
      Following the enactment of new Environmental Management&#13;
      and Co-ordination Act on February 27, 2009, companies now&#13;
      have to obtain approval of projects from the National&#13;
      Environment Management Authority. Projects of all risk&#13;
      categories are subject to approval and an environmental impact&#13;
      assessment (EIA), including the BuildCo warehouse. It takes 30&#13;
      days on average. The cost is set at 0.05% of warehouse value&#13;
      (0.05% * KES 32,500,000.00). Prior to February 11, 2009, the fee   30 days       KES 2,936&#13;
5&#13;
      rate was 0.1% of warehouse value.&#13;
&#13;
      The regulation regarding environmental impact assessment&#13;
      approval for Kenya has been in place since 1999. However, in&#13;
      recent years NEMA started enforcing the rules more vigorously.&#13;
      NEMA conducts periodic inspections during the construction. If&#13;
      new projects at the moment of inspection do not have an&#13;
      environmental impact assessment they may order the project be&#13;
      closed and erected objects demolished. Therefore, construction&#13;
      companies are now obtaining the environmental approval before&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;

The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;

and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;

      to lack of transport, in practice, the inspector often has to be picked up&#13;
      in person and driven to the site.&#13;
6                                                                                      20 days            no cost&#13;
      Previously, such inspections were conducted on a random basis, but now&#13;
      every transaction requires such an inspection. The issues involved are&#13;
      similar to the inspections by the land officer and, therefore, may happen&#13;
      within 1 day to up to over one month. Once the valuer has inspected the&#13;
      property to assess its value, a report is compiled after which the value is&#13;
      endorsed on the transfer and then it is submitted for assessment of the&#13;
      Stamp duty.&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

                                 After Mirage's default on payment, as the debenture holder, BizBank would&#13;
                              initiate receivership by filing an application requiring the High Court of Kenya to&#13;
                               verify an identified receiver pursuant to Part VII Receivers and Managers of the&#13;
                                 Companies Act. Mirage or other unsecured creditors may appeal against the&#13;

Proceedin      receivership&#13;
                                Act, the Court can stay or restrain proceedings accordingly based on relevant&#13;
g&#13;
                                 parties' application, then the receivership proceeding can be converted into&#13;
                               liquidation. However, the conversion is unlikely to happen for Mirage's case as&#13;
                                BizBank holds 74% of the total outstanding debt and it's likely that the Court&#13;
                                                     would approve its receivership request.&#13;

&#13;
                              The receivership will approximately take 4.5 years until BizBank is repaid some or&#13;
                               all of the money owed to it upon the completion of the proceeding. The delay is&#13;
                              largely due to the inefficiency of court and difficulty to organize hearings. It takes&#13;
                               about 2 years until the final judgment is made to approve BizBank's receivership&#13;

                               application and stop the receivership proceeding. Then it would take additional&#13;
                               2.5 years to find a potential buyer of the company, sell it as a going concern and&#13;

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Kenya
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Kenya. To
            allow for useful comparison, the profile also provides data
            for other selected economies (comparator economies) for each
            indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the 13th edition in a
            series of annual reports measuring the regulations that
            enhance business activity and those that constrain it.
            Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business; for
            2015 Kenya ranks 108. A high ease of doing business ranking
            means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the
            starting and operation of a local firm. Doing Business
            presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and
            the protection of property rights that can be compared
            across 189 economies from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over
            time. Doing Business sheds light on how easy or difficult it
            is for a local entrepreneur to open and run a small to
            medium-size business when complying with relevant
            regulations. It measures and tracks changes in regulations
            affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a business: starting
            a business, dealing with construction permits, getting
            electricity, registering property, getting credit,
            protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across
            borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency and labor
            market regulation. The data in this report are current as of
            June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes indicators, which
            cover the period from January to December 2014).
