&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success&#13;
factorsâ&#128;&#153; selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the African&#13;
Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Strategic Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sierra Leone saw a civil war in the 1990s which put most          An annual investment of US$164 million is needed for new&#13;
of its water supply and sanitation infrastructure out of          urban and rural water supply facilities, and rehabilitation&#13;
service. Postconflict reform has advanced steadily to             of existing facilities. Compared with anticipated public&#13;
create an enabling framework for accelerated water and            financing, the projected minimum deficit totals over&#13;
sanitation service delivery in line with good practice. The       US$130 million per year for the water supply subsectors.&#13;
Local Government Act (2004) is devolving water supply             For sanitation the annual capital investment requirement&#13;
functions to local councils. A new National Water and             is US$40 million. In rural sanitation the emphasis&#13;
Sanitation Policy recommends major reforms which include:         on Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) with its&#13;
(a) shifting government focus from implementer to policy          no-subsidy approach means public expenditure will mainly&#13;
making and facilitation; (b) creation of a National Water         go to support information, education and communication&#13;
Resources Board with responsibility for water resources           (â&#128;&#152;softwareâ&#128;&#153;) interventions, with capital costs in theory&#13;
management; (c) establishment of a regime for regulating          financed by users. However, it is not clear that sufficient&#13;
water supply and sewerage services which effectively              resources are being committed to software, meaning&#13;
balances economic, financial, and social objectives; and (d)      actual household contributions could be well below what is&#13;
enactment of a new Water Law which creates a legislative          required. In urban sanitation, with a much lower expected&#13;
framework for all those involved in the sectorâ&#128;&#148;public and         user contribution, and higher investment requirements,&#13;
private, present and futureâ&#128;&#148; and supersedes outdated              there is a projected annual deficit of US$26 million&#13;
water-related legislation.                                        per year.&#13;
&#13;
National targets for water supply and sanitation are 74           Whilst these funding gaps are significant, recent moves&#13;
percent and 66 percent, respectively, as stated in the            towards developing a well-articulated investment plan and&#13;
National Water and Sanitation Policy. The same targets            transparent and accountable systems for procurement and&#13;
apply in both rural and urban subsectors. The latest estimate     utilization may, in fact, see more investment flowing to the&#13;
for water supply coverage from the Joint Monitoring               sector.&#13;
Programme (JMP) (2008) is 49 percent, achieved mainly&#13;
in urban areas (86 percent coverage, as opposed to 26             While these efforts to improve the enabling environment are&#13;
percent in rural areas). The high rate of urban coverage          helping to support the development of new infrastructure&#13;
is, however, contested by sector stakeholders, who argue          in Sierra Leone, mechanisms for sustaining services are&#13;
that it is overly optimistic and does not factor in the poor      inadequate, in particular for the maintenance of existing&#13;
quality of water supplied through sources that are labeled        water supply facilities, and the development of markets for&#13;
â&#128;&#152;improvedâ&#128;&#153;. The 2008 coverage estimate for improved               sanitation goods and services in rural areas.&#13;
sanitation is 13 percent (based on the JMP definition which&#13;
excludes shared facilities). Historic coverage figures indicate   This second AMCOW Country Status Overview (CSO2) has&#13;
that if past rates of delivery continue, both the water and       been produced in collaboration with the Government of&#13;
sanitation targets will be missed by a very wide margin.          Sierra Leone and other stakeholders.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;

1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
Council on Water (AMCOW) delegated this task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African&#13;
Development Bank who are implementing it in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across&#13;
SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced in collaboration with the Government of Sierra Leone and other stakeholders&#13;
during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

National targets for water supply and sanitation are 74 percent                (MDG) targets from JMP data, is complicated by the lack&#13;
and 66 percent, respectively, as stated in the 2008 National                   of JMP estimates of coverage in 1990. Due to insufficient&#13;
Water and Sanitation Policy, with the same targets applied                     household surveys, the JMP trendline is extrapolated only as&#13;
in urban and rural areas alike. In the absence of up-to-date                   far back as 1994, and is flat from 1994 to 1998. As Figure&#13;
national estimates of coverage, the latest estimates from the                  1 indicates, extrapolating the 1998â&#128;&#147;2008 trendline forward&#13;
Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) provide the best indication                   portrays a continued decline in coverage for water supply, and&#13;
of sector progress. 3 According to the JMP coverage for water                  a slight upward trend for sanitation. In both cases, coverage&#13;
supply reached 49 percent in 2008: while an impressive 86                      in 2015 is set to fall well below the national targets unless&#13;
percent of the urban population is estimated to have access                    significant acceleration occurs. At the same time, the lack of&#13;
to an improved source of drinking water, coverage is only 26                   a 1990 baseline precludes calculation of the internationally&#13;

contested by sector stakeholders, who argue that it is overly                  of people without access, relative to 1990 levels. Comparing&#13;
optimistic and does not take into account the poor quality                     national estimates of coverage in 1990 to the 2008 JMP&#13;

According to the JMP, improved sanitation coverage stood at                    prospect without significant acceleration (Figure 1). Some&#13;
13 percent in 2008 (24 percent in urban areas, 6 percent in                    argue that the targets for the rural subsectors, in particular,&#13;
rural areas) which excludes those accessing shared facilities                  may be too optimistic given the current access figures.&#13;
(Figure 1). Open defecation in rural areas is high, estimated&#13;
at 46 percent of the population.&#13;

Sufficiency of Finance                                                    In the rural subsector users are expected to meet 100&#13;

The CSO2 costing tool was used to estimate the investment                 Sanitation (CLTS) approach, with public funding primarily&#13;
required to meet the government targets, of 74 percent                    engaged in awareness creation, sensitization, and capacity&#13;
for water supply and 66 percent for sanitation, from the                  building. These â&#128;&#152;softwareâ&#128;&#153; activities are assumed to be&#13;
JMP access figures for 2008. In the absence of national                   covered under recurrent expenditure and are not factored&#13;
unit cost figures for use in the model, regional proxies were             into the requirements calculated using the model.5 The&#13;

The annual capital investment requirement to meet the&#13;

public funding of US$28 million per year is currently                     if different (and perhaps more realistic) coverage figures&#13;

Faced with the challenges of a postconflict environment,           the intentions set out in the policy, a new Water Law is&#13;
sector reform has recognized the following priorities,             under development, which will review and incorporate&#13;
among others: (a) provision of safe drinking water and             all existing water-related laws and regulations, create a&#13;
sanitation facilities for deprived communities in rural and        Water Department to act as the principal advisory wing of&#13;
urban areas through rehabilitation and reconstruction of           the ministry, and define new regulatory agencies that will&#13;

       â&#128;¢	    Develop appropriate strategies and guidelines to support the implementation of interventions.&#13;

&#13;
The JMP figures show a reduction in rural water coverage              (see Section 5), anticipated public funding of around&#13;
from 49 percent in 1994 to 26 percent in 2008. Due to                 US$17 million per year still leaves a considerable deficit,&#13;
lack of household surveys, the trendline is not extrapolated          given the large backlog in coverage indicated in Figure&#13;
back to 1990, and flatlines from 1994â&#128;&#147;1998. The national              11. While it was estimated for the CSO2 costing model&#13;

a slower decline. In either case, however, projecting the             costs of installations, current anticipated public allocations&#13;
trendlines to 2015 shows that the national subsector                  mean only US$2 million per year in user finance would be&#13;
target of 74 percent is unlikely to be reached. According             leveraged in this way. The relative poverty in rural areas&#13;

 sanitation coverage from 4 percent in 1994 to 6 percent                is the high incidence of open defecation (estimated at 36&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Sierra Leone
            : turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            and what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in
            over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been
            produced in collaboration with the Government of Sierra
            Leone and other stakeholders during 2009-10. The analysis
            aims to help countries assess their own service delivery
            pathways for turning finance into water supply and
            sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and
            urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and
            hygiene. The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a
            review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the
            adequacy of future investments; and a scorecard which allows
            diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service
            delivery pathway. The CSO2's contribution is to answer
            not only whether past trends and future finance are
            sufficient to meet sector targets, but what specific issues
            need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned
            into accelerated coverage in water supply and sanitation. In
            this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified
            through consultation. A synthesis report, available
            separately, presents best practice and shared learning to
            help realize these priority actions.
