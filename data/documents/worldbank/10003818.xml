The Global Public-Private Partnership to Promote&#13;
&#13;
   Handwashing&#13;
                        with Soap&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Handwashing with soap could save a million lives&#13;
    Diarrhoea kills two million children every year. Human excreta is the source&#13;
    of most diarrhoeal pathogens and probably the most important moments&#13;
    at which hands should be washed with soap are after contact with human&#13;
    excreta, and before handling food. A recent review of all the available&#13;
    evidence suggests that handwashing with soap could reduce diarrhoea&#13;
    incidence by 42-46% and save at least one million lives1.&#13;
&#13;
    The Global Public-Private Partnership to&#13;
    Promote Handwashing&#13;
    Handwashing with soap may be an old idea, but it is far from universally&#13;
    practiced. Combining the expertise and resources of the soap industry&#13;
    with the facilities and resources of governments to promote handwashing&#13;
    with soap is one obvious solution. While governments and development&#13;
    agencies want to combat disease and poverty, industry is interested in&#13;
    expanding its market. The World Bank and the Water and Sanitation&#13;
    Program (WSP), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine&#13;
    (LSHTM), the Academy for Educational Development (AED) and the private&#13;
    sector, in collaboration with USAID, UNICEF, and the Bank-Netherlands&#13;
    Water Partnership2 are developing a global initiative aimed at promoting&#13;
    the use of handwashing with soap in developing countries. Work has&#13;
    started in Ghana and India. The results are being monitored and the&#13;
    lessons documented and disseminated. The work is now expanding to&#13;
    four other countries, Senegal, Peru, China and Nepal.&#13;

                                 companies are capable and willing partners for health promotion activities. Four private soap&#13;
                                 companies launched handwashing campaigns in three countries (Guatemala, Costa Rica, and El&#13;
                                 Salvador) in collaboration with the public sector.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the global
            public-private partnership to promote handwashing with soap
            is to reduce the incidence of diarrhea diseases in poor
            communities through public-private partnerships (PPPs)
            promoting handwashing with soap. To implement large scale
            handwashing interventions and use lessons to promote the
            approach at global level. The idea is to get private
            industry and the public sector to work together with other
            partners to develop programs to promote handwashing. The non
            branded programs are open to all interested parties, both
            public and private, targeting those most at risk (mothers,
            children, the poor) across the whole population. Based on
            detailed consumer studies, these programs reach out to
            target audiences through mass media, direct consumer contact
            and government channels of communication. The programs also
            gather knowledge through action research and detailed
            monitoring and evaluation.
