Preface&#13;
&#13;
     In 2001, at the request of the ministers in charge of water affairs in the Nile countries, the World&#13;
     Bank agreed to establish the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF). It was funded by a group of international&#13;
     development partners to support the countries sharing the Nile Basin in pursuing their Shared Vision: to&#13;
     achieve sustainable socio-economic development through equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the&#13;
     common Nile Basin water resources. Over the next 12 years, the NBTF provided over US$200 million for&#13;
     30 projects implemented largely by the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) and its three centers â&#128;&#147; the NBI Secretariat&#13;
     in Entebbe, the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office in Addis Ababa, and the Nile Equatorial Lakes&#13;
     Subsidiary Action Program Coordination Unit in Kigali.&#13;
&#13;
     Today, the Nile countries have advanced cooperative water resources management&#13;
     and development. The countries have transitioned from having little dialogue or collaboration on water&#13;
     resources, to an environment with active information sharing, dynamic regional institutions, and joint&#13;
     prioritization, planning, and implementation of investments. The early success of this cooperation and&#13;
     its tremendous future potential are evidenced by the pipeline of $6 billion in investments currently being&#13;
     advanced by the Nile countries.&#13;
&#13;
     The progress made by the Nile countries would not have been possible without the leadership, commitment,&#13;
     and work of the Nile country governments and the NBI. Ten development partners supported these efforts&#13;
     through the NBTF, including Canada, Denmark, the European Union, France, Finland, Netherlands, Norway,&#13;
     Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the World Bank. Many of the NBTF donors also provided support&#13;
     in parallel to and in coordination with the NBTF. Other coordinating development partners included the&#13;
     African Development Bank (AfDB), Germany (through GIZ and KfW), the Global Environment Facility (GEF),&#13;
     Japan (through the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Policy and Human Resources Development Fund), the Swiss Agency for&#13;
     Development and Cooperation, the United States, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).&#13;
     Through the course of the NBTF, the Nile Program at the World Bank was led by David Grey, Barbara Miller,&#13;
     Gustavo Saltiel and Eileen Burke; under the guidance of Jeffrey Racki, Jaime Biderman, Ashok Subramanian&#13;
     and Jonathan Kamkwalala.&#13;
&#13;
     The Nile Story, comprised of this report and a series of accompanying communication briefs, aims to&#13;
     capture the Nile cooperation process since the formation of the NBI â&#128;&#147; including challenges, responses,&#13;
     and achievements facilitated by the Nile Program â&#128;&#147; to commemorate the support from the NBTF at its&#13;
     closing in 2015.&#13;

    The Nile Story is one of immense challenges and remarkable achievements for the economic development&#13;
    of the region. It begins in 1999, when the ministers in charge of water affairs in the Nile countries agreed to&#13;
    form the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI). Between 2003 and 2015, the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF) supported and&#13;
    coordinated cooperative work in the region, which has been delivered mainly through the NBI. This book â&#128;&#147;&#13;
    commissioned by the World Bank on the closure of the NBTF â&#128;&#147; captures some insights to this 15 year story,&#13;
    the role of the NBI, and how its many achievements have been made along the way.&#13;

              Food shortages are already a serious issue,&#13;
         especially in downstream countries where droughts&#13;
            and flooding have been common. Without food&#13;
       security, people are unable to contribute to economic&#13;
          growth. When famines occur, for instance as has&#13;
      happened over recent years in Ethiopia and Kenya, the&#13;
    result is a depletion of natural assets (especially livestock),&#13;
     volatility in food prices, and a diversion of resources away&#13;
     from potentially productive uses. Future scenarios do not&#13;
     look set to improve. This is mostly due to climate change&#13;
    and extreme weather events, and long-term global supply/&#13;
        demand imbalances driven by increased demand for&#13;
         food, combined with scarcity of water, arable land,&#13;
             and energy. Today, most Nile Basin countries&#13;
               are net food importers, and many depend&#13;
                    on food aid during all too frequent&#13;

&amp;#12;cooperative process. This was an&#13;
historic moment, taking advantage of&#13;
a changing political landscape. There&#13;
was emerging stability across the&#13;
region, with a growing political and&#13;
economic strength of some countries&#13;
and a desire of others to demonstrate a&#13;
geo-political maturity that would enable&#13;
them to engage globally.&#13;
The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) â&#128;&#147;&#13;
launched in 1999 â&#128;&#147; has been able to&#13;
transform how the Nile countries work&#13;
together, successfully addressing&#13;
wider development constraints&#13;
and providing opportunities on an&#13;
equitable, regional level.&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Before the Nile Basin Initiative,â&#128;&#157;&#13;
recalls Dr. Callist Tindimugaya,&#13;
Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s Commissioner for Water&#13;
Resources and current Nile Technical&#13;
Advisory Committee (Nile-TAC)&#13;
member, â&#128;&#156;no one would talk in&#13;
meetings because of the suspicion.&#13;
But now we can disagree without&#13;
becoming enemies. We can move&#13;
forward because we recognize&#13;
that we are different, with different&#13;
interests, so we need to try to&#13;
harmonize them.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
The NBI was launched with a shared&#13;
vision to explore opportunities for&#13;
maximizing the benefits of the riverâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
waters for all the partners. Nile-COM&#13;
acknowledged the challenges faced&#13;
and lessons from past efforts, and&#13;
built on the useful foundations of&#13;
TECCONILE. For example:&#13;
 TECCONILEâ&#128;&#153;s action plan was used&#13;
â&#128;¢&amp;#7;&#13;
 to shape the policy guidelines of the&#13;
 NBI, which focused on enhancing&#13;
 cooperation and implementing&#13;
 technical support activities to&#13;
 generate and share information and&#13;
 knowledge, and to help countries&#13;
 prepare Nile-based development&#13;
 projects that would be regionally&#13;
 significant.&#13;
 Nile-COM decided to continue legal&#13;
â&#128;¢&amp;#7;&#13;
 negotiations towards a Cooperative&#13;
 Framework Agreement (CFA) to&#13;
 formalize rights and obligations in&#13;
 relation to Nile water development&#13;
 and management. However, they&#13;
 recognized that this required a&#13;
 separate and challenging political&#13;
                                             The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) is a regional&#13;
 dialogue, and therefore designed a&#13;

  Institutionalizing the NBI Set up&#13;
  to be a transitional organization,&#13;
  the NBI is becoming something&#13;
  much more. An organization&#13;
  provides a function or services,&#13;
  but could be replaced. An&#13;
  institution is something more&#13;
  based on values, something more&#13;
  trusted, credible and sustainable,&#13;
  something that would be missed&#13;
  if it were not there. An institution&#13;
  is more attractive to investors and&#13;
  financial institutions, because it is&#13;
  likely to face less social, political,&#13;
  financial, and environmental risks.&#13;

Not only do the NBI projects clearly        practice. Transboundary policies&#13;

Transboundary perspectives&#13;
in national policies&#13;
There is now evidence that&#13;
transboundary perspectives are&#13;
being included in national water&#13;
policies. Through its water policy&#13;
component and the preparation of              a historic shift&#13;
river basin management projects               towards cooperative,&#13;
(for example Kagera, Mara and Sio-&#13;
Malaba-Malakisi), the NBI identified&#13;
                                              system-wide&#13;
gaps in transboundary water policies          development and&#13;
and related instruments across                management of the&#13;
the region, and established best&#13;
practice in water policy formulation.         Nile waters&#13;
With support from the NBI (funded&#13;
by Germany and Sweden), each&#13;
of the countries was facilitated in&#13;
aligning their transboundary water&#13;
policies with international best&#13;

     Examples of transboundary perspectives in national policies&#13;
      1 In Kenya, the NBIâ&#128;&#153;s work is in use in                                     4 In Rwanda, transboundary water resource&#13;
     catchment planning, and the Government                                      management concerns are increasing. Most&#13;
     has formulated a transboundary water                                        of its rivers and lakes are transboundary,&#13;
     policy, awaiting Cabinet approval. This                                     with 90% within the Nile Basin. Following&#13;
     was supported by the NBI through training                                   the development of a National Water Policy,&#13;
     Government staff (many of whom have been                                    a strategy for water resource management&#13;

     MSc degrees, and one a doctorate), and                                      new strategy arose out of the Government&#13;
     documentation of best practices in integrated                               of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s plan to increase water use&#13;

     NBI also supported drafting of bilateral                                    because of the declining quantity and quality&#13;
     cooperative frameworks for sharing water                                    of water, as well as the need to ensure&#13;
     between Kenya and Tanzania, and Kenya                                       equity and sustainability in water allocation.&#13;
     and Uganda. The Government believes this                                    The preparation of this strategy has been&#13;
     new policy will result in better management                                 supported by GIZ through its project on&#13;

                    Watershed management and agriculture in the Nile Basin&#13;
                    The agricultural sector in the Nile Basin countries is a major contributor to GDP,&#13;
                    employment, and food security. However, only about 36% (14 million hectares) of potential&#13;
                    agricultural land is cultivated. In addition, productivity remains low in most areas. Nearly&#13;
                    90% of agricultural land is rain-fed, which supports predominantly subsistence farming&#13;
                    and results in low yields of crops and livestock. There is real potential to address these&#13;
                    issues and increase overall productivity.&#13;
                    Currently there are only about 5.6 million hectares of land under irrigation, or equipped with&#13;
                    irrigation facilities, in the Nile Basin, and 97% of that is in Egypt and Sudan, where crop&#13;
                    productivity and water-use efficiency are high in the irrigation schemes. The huge potential&#13;
                    of the agriculture (growing and processing) sector in the Nile Basin is underdeveloped.&#13;
                    Although more food has been produced over the years, it is still not enough to provide for&#13;
                    the growing population and all countries have to import food. There is little trading between&#13;
                    Nile Basin countries as few of them generate enough to be able to trade.&#13;
                    Watershed programs normally introduce more sustainable and productive agricultural&#13;
                    methods, along with soil and water resource conservation measures, resulting in the&#13;
                    generation of large numbers of rural jobs. Watershed management therefore has significant&#13;
                    potential to improve livelihoods and reduce food insecurity by improving productivity.&#13;

                                            The Tana-Beles Project, situated in Amhara, Ethiopia, has proved very&#13;
                                            successful. It was prepared by ENTRO and implementation began in 2011, with&#13;
                                            the aim of undertaking a pilot project to rehabilitate degraded lands through&#13;
                                            water and soil conservation. The pilot project is being implemented in the&#13;
                                            severely degraded Rib, Jema, and Gumera sub-watersheds of the Nile, which&#13;
                                            cover approximately 85,000 hectares of land. Significant time was invested in&#13;
                                            project preparation with training, workshops, and exposure visits both regionally&#13;
                                            and to other water basins in China and India.&#13;
                                            The project has a component for livelihood support, including provision of&#13;
                                            social services (e.g. health services and access to clean drinking water, which&#13;
                                            is significantly reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases within the&#13;
                                            community), and introduction of income-generating activities. In fact, the youth&#13;
                                            in the community have been so inspired by the project that they have formed an&#13;
                                            association that provides a platform to raise credit for building income-generating&#13;
                                            activities. Today, the youth are increasingly engaging in improved farming&#13;
                                            activities as they see the positive results of the project.&#13;
                                            The community is also involved in the monitoring and evaluation processes,&#13;
                                            which builds on their sense of responsibility as environmental stewards. As a&#13;
                                            result, improvements are already visible, including a reduction in erosion, and an&#13;
                                            increase in soil fertility, crop yields, and land restoration.&#13;
                                            In addition, sedimentation has been reduced. For example, monitoring at Tana-&#13;
                                            Beles has recorded a reduction of around 50% in sedimentation levels since the&#13;
                                            project started.&#13;
                                            Another success has been the introduction of a no-grazing policy on agricultural&#13;
                                            land, since grazing animals often destroy crops and soil fertility. Today, the&#13;
                                            Amhara district government has decided to repeat this in the whole province,&#13;
                                            and introduced a Community Watershed By-Law in 2014.&#13;
                                            The watershed project has been so successful that the district government has&#13;
                                            replicated it elsewhere in the province, thus benefiting thousands more farmers.&#13;

          Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (Phase II): Truly regional, highly collaborative&#13;
          This project was identified by the five East African Community (EAC) states, which requested that NELSAP&#13;
          prepare the Rwanda and Burundi component, building on earlier work in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania,&#13;
          as well as on other watershed management project preparation work being done for the Kagera sub-&#13;
          basin. Investment finance mobilization of US$40 million from the World Bank, Sweden, and the Global&#13;
          Environment Facility was done in coordination with the Lake Victoria Basin Commission and the EAC&#13;
          member states.&#13;
          Lake Victoria and its basin support a large fishing industry (for export and local consumption) and&#13;
          hydropower production, and it provides drinking and irrigation water, as well as an important navigation&#13;
          route. But these benefits have become threatened and there is:&#13;
           Deteriorating water quality â&#128;&#147; due to increased sedimentation caused by upstream activities (such as&#13;
          â&#128;¢&amp;#7;&#13;
           deforestation and forest degradation), which exacerbate pollution from increasing urbanization and&#13;
           industrialization.&#13;
           Declining lake levels and river flows â&#128;&#147; due to increasing extraction of water for irrigation and hydropower.&#13;
          â&#128;¢&amp;#7;&#13;
           Resurgence of water hyacinth growth â&#128;&#147; due to water quality issues. These plants obstruct waterways&#13;
          â&#128;¢&amp;#7;&#13;
           and contribute to reduced water flows and lower oxygen levels in the water. This excessive growth&#13;
           consequently affects aquatic biodiversity.&#13;
           Reduced fish stocks â&#128;&#147; due to pollution, sedimentation, hyacinth growth, and high levels of fish&#13;
          â&#128;¢&amp;#7;&#13;
           harvesting.&#13;
          Rwanda and Burundi are part of the upper watershed that drains into Lake Victoria through the Kagera&#13;
          River, and activities there influence the problems in the lake. The river contributes about 30% of the&#13;
          total flow into the lake, but also brings high levels of sediment from upstream soil erosion, resulting in an&#13;
          estimated two hectares additional coverage of water hyacinth every day.&#13;
          The project therefore has a strong focus on watershed management (alongside institutional capacity&#13;
          building, policy harmonization, and pollution control measures). Over 6,000 hectares of rangelands&#13;
          and wetlands are being brought under sustainable land management, hillsides are being restored for&#13;
          production and conservation, and community-driven livelihood activities that are less degrading are being&#13;
          initiated. In both Rwanda and Burundi, the project is implemented in districts within the Kagera basin,&#13;
          working closely with national land and water management programs.&#13;

Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Project&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Electricity from the Rusumo Falls project will have a major&#13;
impact on the economies of Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania,&#13;
with more reliable and cheaper energy for thousands more&#13;
people.â&#128;&#157; William Katete, Regional Rusumo Falls Hydro-&#13;
Electric Project&#13;
Economic development in Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania&#13;
is constrained by very low rates of access to electricity â&#128;&#147;&#13;
4%, 13%, and 15% respectively. Sited on the border of&#13;
these countries, the Rusumo Falls hydroelectric project is a&#13;
flagship example of transboundary cooperation for economic&#13;
development.&#13;
Conceived over 30 years ago, the project was then unable&#13;
to get off the ground. This was due to a number of barriers,&#13;
such as funding challenges, political instability, conflicts&#13;
between countries, lack of security for investors, and the&#13;
lack of a mechanism to coordinate a transboundary project&#13;
of this scale.&#13;
The NBI has played a significant role in moving the Rusumo&#13;
project forward, and it is now the biggest investment being&#13;
implemented under the SAPs. By investing in power options&#13;
studies and collaborative feasibility studies, the NBI has&#13;
demonstrated how the risks related to some of the barriers&#13;
can be mitigated.&#13;
This has contributed to a level of understanding and&#13;
trust among the three countries that has enabled them to&#13;
reconsider the viability of the Rusumo concept. In 2005, they&#13;
committed to work together to develop the power plant and&#13;
sustainably manage the water catchments that supply it.&#13;
Eight years later, a US$470 million loan was secured from&#13;
investors including the World Bank, AfDB, and European&#13;
bilateral development partners. Construction of the power&#13;
plant started in early 2015.&#13;
The impacts expected are tremendous and life-changing for&#13;
many people. In the long term, the Rusumo Falls project will&#13;
generate and transmit 80MW of electricity a year, bringing&#13;
electricity to 520,000 Burundians, 467,000 Rwandese, and&#13;
159,000 Tanzanians. This reliable and cheaper electricity will&#13;
be transformative for national and local economies currently&#13;
in a position of substantial power poverty.&#13;
The social and environmental policy guidance of the NBI has&#13;
also helped minimize negative impacts at the local scale.&#13;
For example, the countries cooperatively agreed to use a&#13;
â&#128;&#152;run-of-the-riverâ&#128;&#153; design instead of a large reservoir, so that&#13;
fewer local people and less habitat area would be affected&#13;
by the development. Meaningful participation of local people&#13;
in the planning process meant that they understood and&#13;
accepted what the implementation would mean in practice,&#13;
recognizing the bigger picture and wider benefits.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For example, in the Lake Kyoga basin&#13;
in Uganda there is a high flood risk&#13;
in areas of high population densities,&#13;
with heavily planted hillsides which&#13;
exacerbate the threat of landslides.&#13;
In other areas, drought is frequent.&#13;
These problems have severe impacts&#13;
on livelihoods and poverty. NELSAP&#13;
devised a strategy to help reduce&#13;
the impacts through structural&#13;
interventions, for example, building&#13;
water storage and hillside protection&#13;
infrastructure, and catchment&#13;
management planning. The work is&#13;
ongoing through Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s water&#13;
management and development&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Key outcomes from disaster&#13;
   and flood resilience projects&#13;
   At least 350,000 people receive&#13;
   early warning messages that&#13;
   enable a reduction in flood-related&#13;
   devastation for over 2 million&#13;
   vulnerable people. And replication&#13;
   of ENTROâ&#128;&#153;s flood forecasting&#13;
   work by national governments is&#13;
   taking those benefits to millions&#13;
   more across the region, improving&#13;
   disaster and flood resilience.&#13;

     Civil society voices:&#13;
     The Nile Basin Discourse&#13;
     The Nile Basin Discourse (NBD) is an umbrella organization for national civil&#13;
     society organizations (CSOs). It creates a network of organizations in each&#13;
     Basin country to interact with the NBI, and to influence the program and&#13;
     project designs.&#13;
     â&#128;&#156;Nile Basin Discourse has a network. The aim is to mobilize CSOs towards&#13;
     a shared vision. We are the most organized among river basin networks&#13;
     and this provides us with a strong platform. Lobbying is important. We are&#13;
     the â&#128;&#152;watchdog,â&#128;&#153; and governments need to be held to account, for example,&#13;
     ensuring that there is sufficient compensation for people for energy projects.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
     Achilles Byaruhanga, Chair, NBD Board&#13;
     The NBD has been effective in this role. For example, through the involvement&#13;
     of NBD members, the Rusumo Falls project designed to take into account&#13;
     issues relating to the number of displaced people. Using a â&#128;&#152;run-of-the-riverâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
     design, instead of a large-scale dam, the number of displaced people was cut&#13;
     from tens of thousands to just over 500. â&#128;&#156;We are glad that we were consulted&#13;
     throughout â&#128;&#147; and that we will get fair compensation,â&#128;&#157; says Manuaru Fanuel&#13;
     (pictured here), who owns a shop nearby.&#13;
     â&#128;&#156;There was considerable stakeholder participation in the Rusumo Falls project&#13;
     â&#128;&#147; how would people be compensated, and so on. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve been able to mobilize&#13;
     all sorts of people: elders, women, and youth. People want to know the&#13;
     benefits of projects such as hydropower. If you donâ&#128;&#153;t work with the people and&#13;
     people cannot see the benefits, the project will not be successful,â&#128;&#157; explains&#13;

Cooperation in International Waters in Africa&#13;
CIWA was established in 2011. It supports riparian countries across sub-Saharan Africa with sustainable development and&#13;
cooperative management, through improving the quality and accessibility of information, strengthening institutions, and&#13;
providing support for preparing investments with regional benefits. It seeks to build on the successes of, and lessons from,&#13;
the joint partner engagement around the NBTF.&#13;
CIWA offers strong technical expertise in international waters, as well as continuing to ensure safeguards are in place with&#13;
regard to investment projects, which it proposes to place at the center of its ethos. And by supporting communications and&#13;
knowledge dissemination, CIWA believes it important to promote the engagement of civil society in consensus building for&#13;
regional cooperation on transboundary waters.&#13;

            The Nile story : 15 years of Nile
            cooperation - making an impact
        </repnme>

            The Nile Story is one of immense
            challenges and remarkable achievements for the economic
            development of the region. It begins in 1999, when the
            ministers in charge of water affairs in the Nile countries
            agreed to form the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI). Between 2003
            and 2015, the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF) supported and
            coordinated cooperative work in the region, which has been
            delivered mainly through the NBI. This book, commissioned by
            the World Bank on the closure of the NBTF, captures some
            insights to this 15 year story, the role of the NBI, and how
            its many achievements have been made along the way.
