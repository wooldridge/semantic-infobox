The results of analysis and sector dialogue, developed during the&#13;
implementation of the Monitoring Country Progress on Drinking          HIGHLIGHTS&#13;
Water and Sanitation (MAPAS) regional initiative, indicate that&#13;
it is essential to complete the process of legal and institutional     Population Growth Demands Greater and Better Targeted&#13;

the Central America and Dominican Republic Forum for Drinking          the Dominican Republic are on track to meet the MDG&#13;
Water and Sanitation (FOCARD-APS) member countries.                    targets for water and sanitation by 2015, those results could&#13;

These reforms should clearly define sector roles to enable effective   insufficient investment in the sector.&#13;

Additionally, the reforms should encourage the independence            live in rural areas. Financial resources allocated to the WSS&#13;

    and far below regional and global benchmarks. This translates&#13;
                                                                          targets and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.&#13;
    into low user satisfaction, which in turn jeopardizes the&#13;
    sustainability of the results achieved across all countries.&#13;
&#13;
    Moving the Reform Process Forward is of Vital Importance&#13;
    The countries should focus on getting sector institutions to&#13;
    work rather than keep changing the institutional framework.&#13;
    They should establish clear sectoral policies that enable&#13;
    effective stewardship and regulation, as well as planning based&#13;
    on the need to extend coverage and improve the quality of&#13;
    drinking water and sanitation services to the entire population.&#13;
&#13;
    Revise Strategies and Standards is critical to meet the new&#13;
    targets&#13;
    It is critical to define new sector strategies and revise standards&#13;
    oriented towards achieving universal access to quality WSS&#13;
    services in all countries in the region.&#13;
&#13;
    Urge a new water culture to promote protection and&#13;
    rational use of water resource&#13;
    The median water consumption in Central American and the&#13;
    Dominican Republic is almost 30% higher than the average in&#13;
    the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean.&#13;
&#13;
    Better Information for Better Services&#13;
    Systematically compiling sector information is crucial to having&#13;
    well-informed investment planning and tracking progress&#13;
    toward better WSS services.&#13;

The financial analysis in MAPAS revealed a large shortfall in                   The analysis also underscored the need to improve budgeting&#13;
investment needed to reach the targets for water and sanitation                 capacity in the sector. The average expenditure rate reached&#13;
set by the governments of the countries analyzed. The annual                    only 80% between 2008 and 2010, leaving some US$ 12.7, 12.6,&#13;
gap between planned investment and required investment is                       and 19.5 million unspent annually in El Salvador, Honduras, and&#13;
particularly acute in the sanitation subsector, where there is an               Panama over this period.&#13;
estimated deficit of US$ 182, 193, and 194 million in El Salvador,&#13;
Honduras, and Panama, respectively (Figure 3). The annual                       In this context, increasing investment to the level necessary to&#13;
investment gap in drinking water amounts to US$ 73, 157, and                    reach the water and sanitation targets countries have set will&#13;
65 million across the three countries, leaving a total annual                   be insufficient. Rather, it is essential to couple investment with&#13;
investment deficit in drinking water and sanitation of US$ 864                  revised standards that enable alternative solutions and financial&#13;
million in the region.                                                          policies that promote efficiency at sector institutions and the&#13;
                                                                                sustainability of service providers, strengthening their financing&#13;
Investment in water and sanitation is clearly insufficient to                   capacity so they are able to cover some of the investment costs.&#13;
reach targets in both urban and rural areas (See Figure 4). The&#13;
investment gap is larger is urban areas, reflecting the difficulties&#13;
the sector faces in sustaining coverage achieved and broadening&#13;
access to account for rapid population growth, particularly in&#13;
peri-urban areas. Interestingly, the three countries have each&#13;
reached a deficit of some US$ 190 million per year.&#13;
&#13;
The investment deficit in rural areas is no less significant. This is&#13;
explained by the fact that service quality and coverage targets&#13;
for rural areas have been set lower than those of urban areas.&#13;
This reinforces inequalities between urban and rural areas, that&#13;
have particularly low levels of coverage in Afro-descendent and&#13;
indigenous communities.&#13;
&#13;
One relevant finding is that the cost to rehabilitate and replace&#13;
existing systems greatly surpasses the investments required&#13;
for new infrastructure to extend services to the population&#13;
that does not have access in all the countries (Figure 5). This is&#13;
due to the fact that many existing systems, built decades ago,&#13;
are reaching the end of their design lives. Moreover, this wear&#13;
and tear contributes to an increase in operating costs, further&#13;
undermining investment in new systems. While replacing these&#13;
systems will be critical to sustain current coverage levels, no&#13;
country has mechanisms in place to finance or provide funds for                 Wastewater treatment plant in Panama City, Panama. Ministry of Health&#13;

                                                                                             of the institutional framework is compromised largely by weak&#13;
    The scorecard evaluates the service delivery pathway through                             planning. This contrasts with average scores in policies as well&#13;
    which the country transforms funding into sustainable water and                          as budget, except in the case of rural sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
    sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural water, urban                       This limits the development of the subsector, where inequitable&#13;
    water, rural sanitation, urban sanitation (Table 2). The pathway is                      resource allocation represents the main obstacle and the average&#13;
    evaluated through nine building blocks, which are grouped into                           score for expenditures is insufficient to obtain satisfactory&#13;
    three main pillars, analyzed through: (1) the effectiveness of the                       results, specifically in sanitation and hygiene. Meanwhile the&#13;
    institutional framework, (2) the concrete results obtained through                       low scores across all subsectors in operation and maintenance&#13;
    the process of developing plans and sector activities, and (3) the                       capture serious challenges in funding, continuity, efficiency, cost&#13;
    sustainability of the services provided. Each building block is                          recovery, which translates into limited ability to expand services&#13;
    scored from 0 to 3 depending on the responses to the three to five                       and low user satisfaction, putting the sustainability of these&#13;
    indicators per block. The scorecard uses a traffic-light color code.                     results at risk.&#13;
    A green block means a highly satisfactory score (higher than 2); a&#13;
    yellow block means a neutral score (between 1 and 2); and a red                          Figure 6 compares the current situation with the possible&#13;
    block means an unsatisfactory score (below 1).                                           medium term scenario in which the programs currently under&#13;
                                                                                             implementation achieve their expected results and ongoing&#13;
    SCORECARD RESULTS                                                                        sector reforms are effectively carried out in El Salvador, Honduras,&#13;
                                                                                             and Panama.&#13;
    The scorecard highlights the principal obstacles that the water and&#13;
    sanitation subsectors face in transforming financial resources into                      The comparison between the two scenarios allows for predicting&#13;
    quality, sustainable services, as well as the reform priorities in the                   that the significant progress hoped for in policy and budget might&#13;
    three pillars based on the combined results of the MAPAS initiative                      not result in improved results in the medium term. It is possible&#13;
    in El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama (Table 2). The scorecard results                    that the results would backslide if new actions are not undertaken&#13;
    show that none of the subsectors has reached a level of satisfactory                     to improve the insufficient progress predicted in planning, equity,&#13;
    performance and that the sanitation and hygiene subsector fares                          and operation and maintenance which continue to present&#13;
    worse than water, particularly in rural areas.                                           stumbling blocks to improving efficiency in the sector.&#13;

    CHALLENGES FACING THE WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR                        Financial Crisis&#13;
    IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC                            The global financial crisis has, and will continue to have, a negative&#13;
                                                                             effect on the sector owing in large part to the limited availability&#13;
    External and internal challenges for the sustainable development         of domestic financial resources, foreign assistance, and grants,&#13;
    of the water and sanitation sector were identified through a             primarily in those countries that are highly dependent on bilateral&#13;
    series of workshops and consultations with key stakeholders              and multilateral external finance. These scenarios combined&#13;
    and experts from sector institutions, and have been validated by         with institutional fragility to develop sound proposals that affect&#13;
    representatives of the FOCARD-APS member countries.                      national and regional policy decisions are factors that can limit the&#13;
                                                                             development and sustainability of the sector.&#13;
    Exogenous Challenges for the Sector&#13;
    The following challenges were identified which are outside the           Evolving Political Priorities&#13;
    remit of the domestic WSS sector, though impact its performance          A permanent risk in the countries of Central America and the&#13;
    in drinking water and sanitation service provision:                      Dominican Republic is changing government priorities, which&#13;
                                                                             can affect political support, necessary for the development of the&#13;
    Unplanned Urbanization and Rapid Population Growth                       sector in the countries, as well as the continuity of the regional&#13;
    Unplanned urbanization and rapid increases in the urban                  initiatives that are underway, such as the Regional Agenda for&#13;
    population put the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s achievements in drinking water and           Sanitation, MAPAS, or the Regional Information System for Rural&#13;
    sanitation coverage at risk. This is compounded by inefficiencies        WSS (SIASAR).&#13;
    in the current service delivery model and investment rates that&#13;
    are markedly insufficient to meet growing demand. Between&#13;
    1990 and 2012, the urban population grew on average 89% in the&#13;
    region. Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama doubled&#13;
    their urban populations over that period. A backslide in service&#13;
    coverage is predicted if necessary reforms are not undertaken to&#13;
    improve the performance of urban service providers and funds&#13;
    are not allocated to extend drinking water and sanitation services&#13;
    to the entire urban population, which is estimated to account for&#13;
    80% of the total regional population by 2050.&#13;
&#13;
    Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management&#13;
    Central America has some 723,072 million cubic meters of water,&#13;
    though only uses 8.1% for human consumption (GWP) and&#13;
    many areas suffer shortages. El Salvador, for instance, possesses&#13;
    only 1,752 cubic meters per capita on an annual basis, which&#13;
    approaches the 1,700 cubic meters per capita per year level&#13;
    considered water stress (JimÃ©nez and Asano, 2008). Climate&#13;
    change is accentuating the phenomena of floods and droughts in&#13;
    the region. For example, The Government of Guatemala declared&#13;
    a state of emergency in 2009 for food shortages, malnutrition, and&#13;
    famine caused by a prolonged drought. The drought in the Central&#13;
    American dry corridor has resulted in crop losses of corn, beans,&#13;
    and sorghum of 50-100%, complicating food and nutritional&#13;
    security for the poorest families in the area. Forecasts indicate that&#13;
    the El NiÃ±o will be an ongoing and recurrent phenomenon. This&#13;
    will produce irregular rainfall throughout the region, representing&#13;
    a threat to the availability of water resources and the sustainability&#13;
    of WSS services, notably for those that serve the most vulnerable&#13;
    populations.&#13;

                       â&#128;¢	 The majority of countries in the region do not prioritize drinking water and sanitation in national strategies,&#13;
                          which limits the development of reforms, the preparation of strategic plans, and the allocation of sufficient&#13;

                          project implementation, regulation, and service provision functions.&#13;
                       â&#128;¢	 The current framework has not been fully operationalized and should be adapted to the regional context to&#13;
                          include, inter alia, low cost alternative solutions for drinking water and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
                       â&#128;¢	 The high coverage levels reported mask problems in terms of equity of access, quality, and sustainability of&#13;
                          services.&#13;
&#13;
     Planning:         â&#128;¢	 Investment plans for drinking water and sanitation lack a sectoral focus, instead being linked to specific&#13;

                                                     The lessons learned and best practice&#13;
&#13;
The lessons learned and best practice that are presented below were endorsed by the representatives of the key institutions in the&#13;
FOCARD-APS member countries. The quotes come from participants in the process.&#13;
&#13;
                                                               Lessons learned&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 â&#128;&#156;The ownership of the initiative by the FOCARD-APS and sector institutions of countries together with joint consultations&#13;
     through official intersectoral coordination mechanisms ensured the involvement of the entire structure of the public sector,&#13;
     donors, and civil society, making it a participatory process in each country.â&#128;&#157; This in turn facilitated coordination of information&#13;
     gathering with the GLAAS initiative, promoted by the WHO/PAHO, which avoided duplication of efforts and allowed making more&#13;
     efficient use of the scarce resources available to these sector evaluation exercises.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 â&#128;&#156;The fact that the tool explicitly allowed for the visualization of results through a user-friendly format based on a traffic&#13;
     signal facilitated understanding on the part of all stakeholders and participation of decision makers, contributing to the&#13;
     empowerment of sector authorities.â&#128;&#157; Once technical experts from the various institutions that participated in the process validated&#13;
     the results, sector authorities presented the results in high-level government meetings and organized national events to disseminate&#13;
     findings.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 â&#128;&#156;Validating the results of each of the indicators with reliable sources was critical to increase awareness of weaknesses in the&#13;
     sector.â&#128;&#157; The first round of the exercise offered a very optimistic picture of the sector, with highly satisfactory preliminary ratings in each&#13;
     country, which were then verified as the consultation and validation process moved forward with reliable sources. Open opportunities&#13;
     for consultation and validation with all stakeholders delayed the process but was key to the appropriation of the results by countries.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 â&#128;&#156;Projecting a plausible medium term scenario allowed for visualizing expected results of ongoing initiatives to identifying&#13;
     priority reform actions.â&#128;&#157; A lesson learned from the process was that it is difficult to assign a score based only on three possibilities,&#13;
     as intermediate scores may be considered when there are ongoing reforms or programs that may improve the results. For example, a&#13;
     situation where the government has no plan for sanitation cannot be evaluated in the same way as in a case where the government is&#13;
     preparing it. The comparison of the current situation with a medium term scenario, developed by reassigning scores under the assumption&#13;
     that the expected results of these reforms and programs will be achieved, allowed the exercise to capture these results by visualizing the&#13;
     components that will improve and those that will not, or even worsen, if further action is not taken to prevent this from happening.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 â&#128;&#156;Identifying who should implement each recommendation and aligning implementation of the exercise with the electoral&#13;
     cycle can generate the greatest impact for sector reform in the country.â&#128;&#157; The publication of the results of the MAPAS exercise in&#13;
     the countries at the end of the government cycle was critical to catalyze dialogue around the water and sanitation sector during the&#13;
     political transition, as were policy notes with recommendations to inform the plans of the incoming government about priority actions&#13;
     to improve the performance of WSS service delivery. This lesson learned caused the sector institutions that lead the process to reflect&#13;
     on the relevance of updating the sector assessment every two years, coinciding with the midterm and end of government mandates in&#13;
     the countries. Doing so would allow for the results to be updated based on new sectoral targets set at the midterm, and evaluate the&#13;
     progress made and pending challenges through the end of the government cycle.&#13;

&#13;
                             â&#128;¢	 The availability of information that is generated and validated by the countries will contribute to better reflect&#13;
                                the actual status of the sector in international reports, such as the GLAAS report or post-MDG evaluations.&#13;
&#13;
                             â&#128;¢	 The participatory methodology of the MAPAS initiative may contribute to streamlining the sector policy dialogue&#13;
                                around common challenges and priority actions to be addressed through strategic partnerships between&#13;
                                governments and key sector stakeholders in the region.&#13;
&#13;
                             â&#128;¢	 The results and findings of the MAPAS initiative may contribute to inform the design of regional and national&#13;
        Regional&#13;
                                strategies and promote sector-wide programmatic approach to planning processes in FOCARD-APS member&#13;
                                countries.&#13;
&#13;
                             â&#128;¢	 Having updated information on the status of the WSS sector would enable a higher profile for FOCARD-APS&#13;
                                member countries in regional forum such as LATINOSAN.&#13;
&#13;
                             â&#128;¢	 The sectoral policy dialogue can foster inter-institutional coordination and allow reaching consensus on priority&#13;
                                actions to undertake in the water and sanitation sector in each country.&#13;
&#13;
                             â&#128;¢	 The results of the MAPAS initiative may inform ongoing reform processes and the development of national&#13;
         Country                public policy and plans.&#13;
&#13;
                             â&#128;¢	 Disseminate results at the political and technical level can also contribute to inform the political transition, the&#13;
                                strategies of incoming governments and consequently, the strategic partnerships of the World Bank Group&#13;

&amp;#12;REGIONAL SYNTHESIS&#13;
Central America and Dominican Republic&#13;
Monitoring Country Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation (MAPAS)&#13;
This report is an overview of the MAPAS Regional Synthesis. It summarizes the inputs and results of the regional dialogue on&#13;
the Drinking Water and Sanitation sector carried out under the leadership of FOCARD-APS by official representatives from all&#13;
the member countries. It is based on the results of the initiative in El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama, which are presented&#13;
in individual country reports, complemented by information generated and validated through regional consultation&#13;
workshops, where participants identified common challenges and priority actions needed to improve sector performance&#13;
in the provision of quality drinking water and sanitation in a sustainable way to meet the sector targets established by each&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
The opinions described here are the result of analysis and sector dialogue, and do not necessarily reflect the specific points&#13;
of view of the participating institutions or sponsors.&#13;

            Monitoring country progress in drinking
            water and sanitation (MAPAS) : regional synthesis - Central
            America and Dominican Republic
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The results of analysis and sector
            dialogue, developed during the implementation of the
            monitoring country progress on drinking water and sanitation
            (MAPAS) regional initiative, indicate that it is essential
            to complete the process of legal and institutional reform
            underway and focus on improving effective functioning of the
            institutions that make up the water and sanitation sector in
            the Central America and Dominican Republic forum for
            drinking water and sanitation (FOCARD-APS) member countries.
            These reforms should clearly define sector roles to enable
            effective leadership that facilitates the adoption of sector
            policies and the efficient use of available financing
            through plans based on needs and equity criteria in order to
            broaden coverage to populations without access and improve
            the quality of water supply and sanitation (WSS) services.
            Additionally, the reforms should encourage the independence
            of regulatory agencies and the autonomy of utilities to
            promote efficiency and monitor the quality and
            sustainability of WSS services.
