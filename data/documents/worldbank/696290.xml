years maturity, including 5 years of grace&#13;
Commitment Fee                      0.75 percent on undisbursed loan balance, beginning sixty days&#13;
after signing, less any waivers&#13;
Project Obiectives                  The main objectives of the project are to: (a) develop land and&#13;
water resources to increase farmers' incomes and conserve the&#13;
environment through land terracing and development of about&#13;
5,600 ha and storage of runoff water in about 250 small hill-&#13;
ponds; (b) increase access to rural areas through the&#13;
construction of about 300 km agricultural roads; and (c)&#13;
upgrade the institutional capabilities of the Green Plan (GP)&#13;
and Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), carry out a National&#13;
Agricultural Census and establish an Information Management&#13;
System at MOA.&#13;
Project Description              :  The Project would finance three major components: (a) a land&#13;
and water development component which would include, inter&#13;
alia, mechanical works for the terracing of 3,100 ha of steep-&#13;
sloped land (IFAD financing), construction of terrace-retaining&#13;
walls, construction of 250 hill-ponds of about 10,000 m3&#13;
capacity (20 of which to combat forest fires) and the provision&#13;
of about I million fruit tree seedlings to plant about 2500 new&#13;
and existing terraces; (b) an agricultural roads component&#13;
which would finance the construction of about 85 km of&#13;
asphalted roads and 215 km of earthen roads and provide&#13;
specialized design and works supervision equipment, studies,&#13;
vehicles, as well as incremental staff and recurrent costs; and&#13;
(c) an institutional support component which would include&#13;
improving the implementation capacity of the GP, providing it&#13;
with a new Environmental Information and Monitoring&#13;
Committee (EIMC) and conducting a National Agricultural&#13;
Census, as well as establishing within MOA an Information&#13;
Management System.&#13;

ii                                                Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
Environment                          The Project has been classified as a Category B project for the&#13;
purpose of O.D. 4.01.   Guidelines and environmental&#13;
assessment  checklists  have  already   been  prepared.&#13;
Environmental assessments, to be conducted by the EIMC,&#13;
would become part of all feasibility studies and would be&#13;
implemented under the Project to mitigate potential negative&#13;
effects on the environment of land and water development as&#13;
well as of agricultural roads.&#13;
Povert:  The project is classified under poverty Category "Program of&#13;
Targeted Interventions" (PTI), because of a specific&#13;
mechanism, and the use by the GP of existing local committees&#13;
to help it to focus on needy rural populations, particularly those&#13;
with small land holdings of less than 0.5 ha..&#13;
Benefits                             The primary benefits of the project would be incremental&#13;
agricultural production (58,000 tons of vegetables and 1 10,00&#13;
tons of fruit), the improved management and conservation of&#13;
land and water resources, savings on the cost of rural&#13;
transportation and an updated agricultural sector database. In&#13;
total, about 9,600 farm families or about 75,500 people would&#13;
benefit directly from the project.&#13;
Risks                                The uncertainty of achieving the anticipated agricultural&#13;
benefits on schedule is the first risk that the project may face.&#13;
This risk would be caused by potential delays in the&#13;
implementation of agricultural investments by farmers.  It&#13;
would be mitigated during the selection of project beneficiaries&#13;
by assisting farmers who plan to complete the entire investment&#13;
within two years or who commit themselves to refund the GP&#13;
assistance if they do not complete the investments. The past 30&#13;
years' experience of the GP shows that this risk is in reality&#13;
minimal, as most farmers do indeed complete their investment&#13;
on time. The second risk is related to the maintenance of rural&#13;
roads. This risk would be overcome by providing funds under&#13;
the project for the GP to maintain the roads it builds. In the&#13;
long term, the increasing allocations of road maintenance funds&#13;
made to the Governorate offices and Deputies of the various&#13;
regions in Lebanon would ensure the adequate maintenance of&#13;
agricultural roads.&#13;

LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. The Economy&#13;
1.01    Lebanon is a small mountainous country with an area of 10,450 km2. Its population was&#13;
estimated in 1994 at about 3.4 million. Administratively, Lebanon comprises six administrative&#13;
Governorates (Muhafazats): Mount Lebanon, North Lebanon, South Lebanon, Nabatiye, the Bekaa Valley&#13;
and Beirut (see Map IBRD 27927). The six Muhafazats are sub-divided into 24 Districts (Cazas). Until&#13;
the mid-seventies, Lebanon was a prosperous middle-income country driven mainly by the service sectors,&#13;
namely trade, tourism and finance, which contributed more than 70 percent of the Gross Domestic Product&#13;
(GDP). In 1975, the country plunged into a violent civil war which lasted for nearly 17 years and had&#13;
a profoundly destructive effect on the Lebanese economy and the foundations of Lebanese society.&#13;
B. The Arricultural Sector&#13;
1.02    Agriculture in the Economy. Agriculture GDP has remained significantly below its pre-war&#13;
level (20 percent) and is currently accounting for only 10 per cent of total GDP. Nevertheless, the&#13;
agriculture sector continues to be an important source of income for 20 to 30 percent of the population,&#13;
particularly in hilly and mountainous areas. Moreover, although its share of GDP has fallen since the mid-&#13;
1970s as the trade and service sectors have grown, agriculture accounts for a substantial proportion of&#13;
exports. Approximately 360,000 ha, or slightly more than one-third of Lebanon's total land area of about&#13;
one million ha, is arable. The most fertile areas are located in the Bekaa valley and along the narrow&#13;
coastal strip. Of the 215,000 ha of arable land that are presently cropped, 87,000 ha are under irrigation&#13;
and the rest is rainfed. The remaining 145,000 ha of arable lands are hilly and mountainous and are&#13;
either in fallow or are too steep to be cultivated without rehabilitation and development. Tree crops,&#13;
vegetables and livestock make up a significant proportion of agricultural production. In their quest for&#13;
higher and more stable incomes, farmers have shifted away from annual crops to fruit trees and protected&#13;
high value crops. The proportion of cropped land under fruit trees has risen from 41 percent of the total&#13;
cultivated area in 1974 to more than 51 percent in 1990. About 40 percent of tree crops are receiving&#13;
supplemental irrigation. Major tree crops include olives, grapes, apples, cherries, citrus and bananas. The&#13;
area devoted to cereals decreased from 30.4 percent in 1974 to 18 percent of the total cultivated area in&#13;
1990. Annual crops include cereals, pulses, potatoes, tomatoes, cucurbits and other vegetables.&#13;
1.03    Government Policy and Strategy. Given the limited arable land resources, the deterioration&#13;
of the natural resource base and the steadily growing population, the Govemment has since the early&#13;
sixties given a high priority to land and water conservation and development as well as to improving&#13;
access to isolated rural areas. This was manifested through the creation of the Green Plan (para. 1.07)&#13;
and the provision to land-owners, through cost-sharing arrangements, of incentives to sustainably develop&#13;
their steep-sloped lands. Public financing of land and water development for private farmers is justified&#13;
on several accounts: (i) land and water developments dramatically increase farm income and improve&#13;
living standards so as to reduce poverty in rural areas; (ii) improved rural incomes and standards of living&#13;
reduce the migration of the rural poor to urban areas and facilitate the return of populations displaced&#13;
during the war, thus lowering the cost to the Govemment of urban infrastructure and reducing urban&#13;
congestion; (iii) land and water development activities significantly reduce soil and water erosion and&#13;
protect the environment; and (iv) because initial investment costs are very high and the time it takes for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

these investments to provide returns is long, poor and small land owners cannot afford to make these&#13;
investments on their own since needed credit is virtually unobtainable.&#13;
C. Agricultural Institutions&#13;
1.04    The Council for Development and Recor-struction (CDR). CDR is a financially autonomous&#13;
public institution created in 1977 for the coordination of reconstruction and development planning in&#13;
Lebanon. It is attached to the office of the President of the Council of Ministers to whom it is responsible&#13;
for recommending economic, financial and social policies. It is also entrusted with the channeling of loans&#13;
and grants from external sources to finance the country's reconstruction and development.&#13;
1.05    The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The MOA has the statutory responsibility to formulate&#13;
agricultural policy and to support agricultural development through its central and regional services and&#13;
satellite agencies. After the end of the civil disturbances, the MOA was restructured and re-engineered&#13;
under the provisions of a new organizational decree (Chart 1). The decree entrusts MOA with the&#13;
responsibility for planning, administering and developing the agricultural sector and its related activities.&#13;
The war-induced absence of permanent systems to collect agricultural statistics and the lack of an updated&#13;
sectoral information data base are now the major factors constraining MOA's efforts to forrnulate effective&#13;
agricultural policies and strategies.&#13;
1.06    The Green Plan (GP). The GP is a public authority with considerable management autonomy.&#13;
Established in 1963 under Decree No. 13785, the GP became active in 1964 as an autonomous authority&#13;
under the tutelage of the Minister of Agriculture. Its mandate is "to study and execute land rehabilitation&#13;
and development projects" and its range of activities includes land rehabilitation and development,&#13;
development of hill ponds and small water reservoirs, water distribution systems and small-scale irrigation&#13;
schemes and the construction of agricultural roads. All civil works planned and financed through the GP&#13;
are often designed and always executed by private sector contractors. As shown in Chart 2, the GP is&#13;
headed by an Executive Committee (GPEC) composed of a President and two members. At its Beirut&#13;
headquarters, it is organized into three central services: Cabinet/Administrative, Accounting and Technical.&#13;
In addition to the above three services, the GPEC is supported by a small administrative and advisory unit.&#13;
From an original staff of about 300 in the late sixties, the GP now employs 40 engineers/agronomists and&#13;
some 170 technicians and support staff. The GP's effectiveness is presently constrained not only by staff&#13;
shortages but also by budget resource limitations and a lack of mobility. These have reduced its programs&#13;
and implementation capacity. However, despite its reduced capacity, the GP is still substantially active.&#13;
More details on the GP are in Chapter 11 , Section C.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT CONTEXT&#13;
2.01    Relevance to Country Assistance StrateLuv. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for&#13;
Lebanon was last discussed by the Executive Directors on June 30, 1994. The proposed project would&#13;
be central to achieving the goals of the CAS, which focus on: (i) addressing social needs and&#13;
environmental concerns; (ii) rehabilitating physical infrastructure; and (iii) helping to rebuild and&#13;
strengthen public administration. The demand-driven land and water development activities to be financed&#13;
under the project would respond to farmers' needs and significantly increase rural income, thereby&#13;
reducing poverty. These same activities would also help reduce soil and water erosion and protect the&#13;
environment. The rehabilitation and construction of agricultural roads would contribute to the upgrading&#13;
of physical infrastructure and to improving the access of rural populations to markets and social services.&#13;
The conduct of a National Agricultural Census and the establishment of a Permanent Statistical System&#13;
and an Information Management System would strengthen MOA's capacity to formulate sectoral policies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project                                             3&#13;
and development strategies, including the promotion of private-sector-led agricultural growth. The project&#13;
is also consistent with the MENA Rapid Country Water Strategy and the draft "Lebanon Environmental&#13;
Strategy Framework Paper."&#13;
A. General Characteristics&#13;
2.02    Location and Climate. Due to the participatory and demand-driven nature of the activities to&#13;
be financed by the proposed project, their location would be distributed throughout Lebanon. They would&#13;
be focused mainly on hilly, remote and less developed areas. Lebanon is blessed with a mediterranean&#13;
climate and has relatively adequate water resources. Temperatures are moderate with no significant&#13;
incidence of frost below 100 m elevation. Annual precipitation ranges from about 1250 mm in central&#13;
Mount Lebanon to just over 800 mm in the South (Map IBRD 27928), which is roughly the average for&#13;
Lebanon as a whole.&#13;
2.03    Farm Size and Credit. According to the last, unpublished 1970 agricultural census, about 46&#13;
percent of farm holdings in Lebanon are small (between 0.5-2 ha); they account for about 9 percent of&#13;
the privately owned lands (POL). Another 28 per cent of holdings are considered to be of average size&#13;
and have an area of between 2 - 5 ha; they account for about 16 percent of the POL. The remaining 26&#13;
percent of holdings have a size of more than 5 ha and account for about 75 per cent of the POL (Annex&#13;
VI, Table 1). There is no source of institutionalized formal credit for agriculture in the country. Small&#13;
and medium-sized farmers can generally obtain loans from family members, local money lenders and&#13;
commercial firms (input suppliers and/or wholesalers) in the form of short-term credit but at very high&#13;
indirect interest rates. Parliament has recently approved a law authorizing the creation of an Agricultural&#13;
Bank with a large share of private-sector participation.&#13;
B. Major Constraints to Hilly Aariculture Land Development&#13;
2.04    Undeveloped hilly agricultural lands often have shallow and eroded soils. After centuries of&#13;
unsustainable cultivation, they have been practically depleted and are presently utilized to either cultivate&#13;
annual subsistence cereals or have been converted to marginal pastures. Under both utilizations their soils&#13;
continue to be eroded. The income these lands generate is no longer sufficient to sustain livelihood. As&#13;
a result, farmers have either taken other jobs to supplement their farm income or have migrated to urban&#13;
areas. Several decades ago, a few well-to-do farmers or those with access to remittances from abroad&#13;
succeeded in changing the production capability of their lands by terracing them and planting them to&#13;
high-value fruit trees. Land terracing, terrace consolidation, planting and water mobilization in hill-ponds&#13;
are the techniques most favored by Lebanese farmers for soil and water conservation and for sustainable&#13;
income-generation. They are, however, expensive and out of reach of most land owners. Through the GP,&#13;
the Government has devised a way to channel assistance to landowners to conserve, improve the aptitude&#13;
and develop lands in the mountainous areas of Lebanon (para. 3.02). The results of GP experience during&#13;
the past three decades is discussed in Section C below.&#13;
2.05    The isolation and lack of access to mountainous agricultural areas has had detrimental effects&#13;
on both the intensity with which lands are cropped and the yields the crops achieve. Because of their&#13;
relatively high elevation, most of these areas are covered with snow in the winter and are wet and muddy&#13;
during the spring. Without agricultural roads, farmers have to wait until tracks become passable and are&#13;
unable to get to their land until late during the cropping season. As a result, they are only able to hastily&#13;
plough and late-seed a few crops on only part of their land; hence, the low cropping intensity. Late-&#13;
seeding of most crops on hastily prepared seed-beds affects the performance of crops and significantly&#13;
reduces their yields. The lack of access roads also makes it difficult for farmers to transport to their farms&#13;
and use adequate arnounts of organic and chemical fertilizers and other crop husbandry products.&#13;
Inadequate fertilization and crop husbandry practices have been observed to reduce crop yields by more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

than 50 percent. Transporting farm products, particularly perishable farm produce, on animal-drawn carts&#13;
or small trucks over several kilometers takes a long time and causes the produce to bruise and diminish&#13;
in quality and price. Because their vehicles suffer frequent breakdowns and high O&amp;M costs, transporters&#13;
charge very high fees. Linking these isolated areas to the local "classified" road network and to villages&#13;
would enable fanners to improve cropping intensity and practices and achieve higher incomes (para. 3.03).&#13;
These agricultural roads would also make it easy for them and their families to access social services from&#13;
their farms.&#13;
2.06    In addition to the specific constraints described in paras. 2.03 and 2.05 above, the Lebanese&#13;
agricultural sector as a whole suffers from the lack of an updated and complete sector information&#13;
database. Because of the civil war and turmoil that followed the conduct of the field surveys and&#13;
completion of the data, the full results of the 1970 agricultural census were never released. Much of the&#13;
information that was collected and analyzed was either destroyed or lost during the war. Presently, the&#13;
MOA is finding it difficult to formulate policies and a coherent strategy for agricultural development&#13;
without essential infornation, an updated sectoral database and adequate staffing. To alleviate this&#13;
constraint, the conduct of a new National Agricultural Census (the last completed census dates to 1960)&#13;
and the establishment of a permanent system for agricultural statistics as well as a documentation center&#13;
would be necessary (para. 3.06). Until public salaries become attractive, MOA staffing needs would&#13;
continue to be met through the recruitment of consultants from the local budget.&#13;
C. Evaluation of the GP's Past Achievements&#13;
2.07    Lessons From Past GP Experience. Since its inception, the GP has adopted a demand-driven&#13;
approach to the execution of land rehabilitation and agricultural roads activities. During the past thirty&#13;
years, the GP has helped terrace about 26,000 ha of sloped privately-owned land (about 0.7 ha per&#13;
fanner), construct more than 7 million m2 of terrace retaining-walls, 500 hill ponds (average capacity =&#13;
8,000 m3) and more than 3,000 small concrete basins. The GP has also built more than 1,000 km of&#13;
agricultural roads. Its activities have benefitted more than 38,000 farmers and about 1,000 villages&#13;
scattered all over Lebanon. After reaching a peak in 1968, the GP's activities declined and became erratic&#13;
during the 17 years of war. Since 1991, the GP's ability to respond to fanner and community demands&#13;
for agricultural roads and land development increased appreciably but remained curtailed by the lack of&#13;
adequate financial resources. In 1994, 800 ha of land were developed and 40 km of agricultural roads&#13;
were constructed. The GP estimates that unsatisfied requests for assistance to land terracing and&#13;
development exceed 40,000 ha, and those for rural roads exceed 2,000 km.&#13;
2.08    The review of past activities indicates that, overall, the development implemented by the GP&#13;
during the last thirty years has been generally successful and in line with its mandate to develop hilly&#13;
lands and improve access to isolated agricultural areas. The administrative procedures used to implement&#13;
the GP's work plans are known to the farming population in Lebanon and have evolved with time and&#13;
are becoming more efficient and more competitive than in the past. It is, therefore, logical for the design&#13;
of the proposed project to build on the current system and institutions and take into account the lessons&#13;
learned from the GP's past experience. These lessons include the need to: (i) increase the efficiency of&#13;
land and water and agricultural roads investments; (ii) introduce greater transparency and competitiveness&#13;
in the award of land-terracing mechanical-works contracts; (iii) put greater focus on environmental aspects;&#13;
and (iv) to the extent feasible, focus project resources on poor areas.&#13;

D. Cost-Sharinf Arrangements&#13;
2.09    Present cost-sharing arrangements set the lifetime assistance allocation at an aggregate ceiling&#13;
of LL 10 million per person and take into consideration only part of the investment required to rehabilitate&#13;
and develop lands. The costs eligible for GP assistance include land terracing, terrace retaining-walls, soil&#13;
ripping, rock removal, hill-pond construction and localized irrigation systems. They amount to about LL&#13;
13 million per ha (US$8,175). Costs eligible for GP assistance do not include those for soil preparation,&#13;
basic fertilization, seedlings, planting costs, replacement of failed trees and crop establishment expenses&#13;
during a period of four years. These are financed by beneficiary farmers. When all costs are added, the&#13;
total investment per hectare reaches about LL 26 million (US$16,350) in North Bekaa or double the&#13;
amount deemed eligible for assistance by the GP. Farmers' share in the costs of land rehabilitation and&#13;
development amounts to 13 percent of eligible costs when the area developed amounts to 0.5 ha; it is 35&#13;
percent for a I ha area; 67 percent for a 2 ha area and reaches 78 percent for a 3 ha area. However, when&#13;
the total costs are taken into account, farmers share of the cost increases to 57 percent for 0.5 ha, 68&#13;
percent for I ha, 84 percent for 2 ha and 89 percent for 3 ha. During negotiations, GOL gave assurances&#13;
that the GP would maintain cost-sharing arrangements at their present level. If a change becomes&#13;
necessary, new arrangements would have to be satisfactory to the Bank [para. 8.01 (a)].&#13;
2.10    Land terracing, water conservation and use and orchard establishment are, in the long term,&#13;
capable of generating substantial incomes even in the poorest areas. The analysis of the financial returns&#13;
of these activities in each of the five Lebanese regions indicates that their IRRs vary between a low of&#13;
18 percent for North Lebanon to a high of 50 percent in South Bekaa. With these lucrative returns, it&#13;
would seem that Government cost-sharing would not be necessary. However, when all the costs of&#13;
investing in land and water developments are added up and analyzed, it becomes clear that farmers would&#13;
not be able to make this type of investment on their own. The estimated initial investment to establish&#13;
and operate (first four years) a one-hectare mixed-crop farm varies between a low of about LP 26 million&#13;
(US$15,700) in North Bekaa to a high of LP 51 million (US$32,000) in South Lebanon. Present average&#13;
farm incomes in Lebanon are not known; however, estimates made during the preparation of the proposed&#13;
project indicate that a one-hectare wheat-farm has an average income of about LL 67,000 (US$42.0),&#13;
which is insignificant.&#13;
2.11    The minimum initial investment in a one hectare fruit-farm in North Lebanon is about LL 26&#13;
million (where some of the poorest areas of Lebanon exist). It is equivalent to 373 times the average&#13;
annual income of a one-hectare wheat-farm in this area. With the existing low incomes of farmers, the&#13;
high initial investment costs and the six years it takes for orchards to break even with operating expenses,&#13;
farmers are unable to muster the necessary financial resources to invest in land terracing and development.&#13;
Without Government assistance, only the rich would be able to undertake this type of activity. Without&#13;
Government assistance, rural farmers would not only be incapable of developing their lands, but would&#13;
also have their land resource base and their present meager incomes deteriorate as a result of erosion. To&#13;
insure their livelihood, they would most likely abandon their farm land and migrate to urban areas, causing&#13;
great expenses to the Government in social infrastructure. In an attempt to deal with this potential&#13;
out-migration, conserve the environment and improve life in the rural mountainous areas, the Government&#13;
has committed itself to share the costs of sustainable development of land and water resources. Past&#13;
experience has indicated that farmers benefitting from the GP's assistance have been able to mobilize their&#13;
share of development cost through personal savings and informal financing channels.&#13;
2.12    Environmental Aspects.  The GP's past activities (terraces, rural roads and fruit tree&#13;
distribution) have generally achieved positive environmental impact. However, in some cases, the lack&#13;
of sufficiently detailed environmental surveys, particularly for agricultural roads, may have resulted in&#13;
effects that are not fully consistent with the objectives of natural resources conservation. These possible&#13;
effects remain undocumented mainly because of the lack of adequate monitoring of the GP's activities and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                 Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
their effect on the environment. In order to avoid potential harm to the environment as a result of future&#13;
activities to be financed by the proposed project, durine negotiation GOL gave assurances that an&#13;
Environmental Information and Monitoring Committee (EIMC) would be created Ipara. 8.01 (b)M within&#13;
the GP. Its role would be to assess, during the study and design stages of project activities, potential&#13;
detrimental effects on the natural resource base and various eco-systems and to propose mitigating&#13;
measures to be undertaken before or during the implementation of these activities (Annex 5).&#13;
E. Design Considerations&#13;
2.13    The objective of improving farmers' income from agriculture in the mountainous areas of&#13;
Lebanon can best be achieved through the development of their land and water resources. To achieve this&#13;
goal several alternatives are available. Agriculture intensification through better cultural practices and a&#13;
higher level of inputs (fertilizers, pesticides and better crop varieties) was the alternative most used in the&#13;
past. The results have often been significant in the short term; however, their long-term benefit was not&#13;
sustainable, mainly because the annual crops grown do not make the best use of resources and often were&#13;
the causes of erosion and pollution. A second alternative, which has been adopted almost exclusively by&#13;
wealthy landholders and was proven sustainable, has been to change the aptitude of the land and improve&#13;
its capacity to support higher value and/or permanent crops. By terracing steep hilly lands, conserving&#13;
their soils, planting them with fruit trees in lieu of erosion-conducive annual crops and storing potentially&#13;
erosive runoff water for summer supplemental irrigation, well-to-do farmers have been able to create&#13;
employment for their families and neighbors, developed and protected natural resources from erosion, and&#13;
substantially increased their income. One of the objectives of the GP was to make the adoption of this&#13;
second natural resources development alternative affordable to smallholders.&#13;
2.14    The Project has been designed under a program approach. Under this approach, regular&#13;
activities of the GP that respond to a set of agreed criteria [para.8.01 (c) and (d)] would be financed by&#13;
the Project. With regard to land and water development activities, a sample of farmers' requests for&#13;
assistance was appraised (Annex II) and was found to be responsive to the agreed criteria except for the&#13;
environmental assessment which remains to be completed. The GP has issued instructions and forms to&#13;
be included in all the feasibility study packages to ensure that the agreed criteria are taken into account&#13;
in the selection of activities that would benefit from GP assistance. Disbursements for land and water&#13;
development would be contingent on the full responsiveness of the planned activities to the agreed&#13;
selection criteria, as ascertained during the review of the GP's annual work program. With regard to&#13;
agricultural roads, the program (70 km) to be implemented during the first two years of the project was&#13;
evaluated and was found to be responsive to the agreed selection criteria (Annex III). The required&#13;
environmental assessment of agricultural roads has been completed. This involved consultations with&#13;
farmers, the GP, NGOs, local community leaders and Government authorities. Detailed designs for the&#13;
two-year road program have been completed and agreement on the expropriation of the land on which&#13;
these roads would pass has either been obtained or is underway. The project components relating to&#13;
institutional capacity building have been well defined and evaluated in detail (paras. 3.05 and 3.06).&#13;
2.15    Stakeholders Participation. Rapid Rural Appraisals and a workshop were conducted during&#13;
project preparation and pre-appraisal. Their results indicate that in order to have an impact on poverty,&#13;
project activities should, to the extent feasible and within the existing social equilibrium, give greater&#13;
priority to the poorest farmers and the most depressed rural areas. According to current GP policy, project&#13;
financial resources would, in principle, be divided equally among the four regions of Lebanon (North&#13;
Lebanon, Mount Lebanon, South Lebanon and the Bekaa). However, it was agreed that the GP may&#13;
allocate up to 20 percent more resources to regions where farmers' demand for assistance are high.&#13;
During negotiations it was further agreed that within regions, the GP's regional offices would target needv&#13;
villazes and communities and that within targeted villages and communities, the Green Plan would work&#13;
with local committees to Rrioritize the poor and target proiect assistance to those most in need. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project                                             7&#13;
participation and involvement of populations through elected representatives (municipalities, cooperatives,&#13;
village associations, etc.) would be used by the GP's regional offices to increase their capacity to identify&#13;
and target needful families. Representatives of populations would, for example, help to: (i) differentiate&#13;
between farmers who rely on farming to make a living from those who have additional sources of income;&#13;
and (ii) determine which potential beneficiaries of the project are the poorest [para. 8.01 (e)]. However,&#13;
project activities would benefit the Lebanese farming population at large and would not be focused&#13;
exclusively on the poor.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Proiect Obeectives&#13;
3.01    The main objectives of the project are to: (i) develop land and water resources on about&#13;
5,600 ha for the purposes of increasing farmners' incomes and protecting the environment through land&#13;
terracing and harvesting of runoff water in small hill-ponds; (ii) increase access to and from isolated rural&#13;
areas through the construction of about 300 km of agricultural roads; and (iii) strengthen the institutional&#13;
and implementation capabilities of the GP and the Directorate of Studies and Coordination (DSC) within&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) by upgrading their human and material capabilities, financing the&#13;
conduct of a National Agricultural Census (NAC) and establishing an Information Management System&#13;
to provide the data necessary for strategy and policy formulation.&#13;
B. Project DescriDtion&#13;
Land and Water Development (base cost US$57.8 million: 73 percent of base cost)&#13;
3.02    The aim of this component is to help farmers achieve the sustainable development of their land&#13;
holdings that are presently under extensive agricultural production or that are not cultivated because past&#13;
practices have caused them to erode and degrade (para. 2.04). Under this component, the project would&#13;
finance: (i) mechanized works for land terracing on about 3,100 ha; (ii) the construction of terrace&#13;
retaining walls to stabilize existing terraces and/or consolidate newly terraced lands; (iii) the construction&#13;
of 250 hill-ponds (10,000 m3 average capacity) and 50 small concrete reservoirs (100 to 300 m3 average&#13;
capacity) to harvest runoff water for supplemental irrigation of crops in the summer. At least 20 ponds&#13;
would be constructed in collaboration with the MOA's Directorate of Rural Development and Natural&#13;
Resources (in charge of Forestry) to provide water for fighting forest fires. Once lands are terraced and&#13;
stabilized, they would be planted to high-return crops such as vegetables, protected vegetables and banana&#13;
trees or to other high-value fruit trees. Therefore, in addition to financing the land terracing and water&#13;
conservation infrastructure described above, the Project would also finance an orchard establishment&#13;
activity through the procurement of about one million fruit tree seedlings to plant 2,500 ha; these would&#13;
be purchased by farners under the same cost-sharing arrangements described in para. 2.09 above. The&#13;
Project would also finance costs associated with the execution of the land and water development&#13;
component, which would include: (i) topographic and office equipment, computers and software to allow&#13;
GP staff to supervise the land terracing and hill-pond construction works; (ii) 4WD vehicles; (iii) local&#13;
staff training; (iv) incremental staff salaries and allowances, as well as (v) office supplies; and (vi) vehicle&#13;
operation and maintenance costs (Working paper No. 4, Table 1).&#13;
Aericultural Roads (base cost US$14.2 million: 18 Dercent of base cost)&#13;
3.03     In order to improve access to agricultural areas and make it easy for rural populations to move&#13;
to and from isolated mountainous areas (see para. 2.05), the project would finance the construction of 85&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                 Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
km of asphalted roads and 215 km of earth roads. Agricultural roads are generally constructed on existing&#13;
tracks made by animal-drawn vehicles or by farm tractors and small trucks. The GP has so far been able&#13;
to carry out design studies on 180 km of roads of which 110 km are at the detailed design stage. The&#13;
execution of the agricultural roads component would follow a program approach, characterized by a well-&#13;
defined two-year work program (Annex II1) evaluated at appraisal and a flexible program (230 km) to be&#13;
studied and evaluated according to agreed criteria (Annex I, para. 3) during project implementation. To&#13;
allow for the conduct of activities associated with the construction of agricultural roads, the project would&#13;
finance: (i) laboratory analysis, feasibility studies and detailed designs for 300 km of roads; (ii) one set&#13;
each of topographical, geo-technical and office equipment in addition to computer software for road design&#13;
and construction supervision by GP staff; (iii) one replacement and 8 new 4WD vehicles; (iv) 4 person-&#13;
months of technical assistance in road design; (v) local and intemational staff training and; (vi) recurrent&#13;
costs for incremental staff salaries and incentives, road maintenance, vehicle operating costs and office&#13;
supplies (Working Paper No. 4, Table 2).&#13;
Institutional Support (base cost US$6.8 million; 9 percent base cost)&#13;
3.04    The institutional support to be provided by the project would target the GP, which would be in&#13;
charge of implementing the land and water development and agricultural roads components, and the&#13;
Directorate of Studies and Coordination (DSC) of the Ministry of Agriculture, which would be in charge&#13;
of the field execution of the agricultural census and the establishment of an information management&#13;
system.&#13;
3.05    The Green Plan. Project support to the GP would encompass the following two sub-&#13;
components:&#13;
(a) Environmental Information and Monitoring (base cost US$0.8 million; 1 percent of&#13;
base cost) The major objective of this component would be to create within GP, through&#13;
EIMC, the institutional capability to undertake simple environmental reviews, assess the&#13;
potential implications of the GP's core activities on critical ecosystems and design measures&#13;
to mitigate their potential negative effect on the environment (Working Paper No. 6). The&#13;
EIMC would also monitor project progress and maintain records on project monitoring&#13;
indicators [paras. 2.12 and 8.01(b)]. To establish the proposed EIMC, the Project would&#13;
finance specialized equipment, including computers, vehicles, etc. (Working Paper No. 4,&#13;
Table 3) as well as vehicle operation and maintenance costs.&#13;
(b) Implementation Capacity Building (base cost USS1.4; 2 percent of base cost). Under&#13;
this subcomponent, project support targets the GP's central offices'. This would allow for&#13;
a faster turnover in the verification of farmers' requests for assistance in land and water&#13;
development, in the review of designs of agricultural roads and in the preparation of tender&#13;
documents. The Project would finance office equipment, 4WD vehicles, consultant services,&#13;
the organization of farrners information campaigns, etc. (Working Paper No. 4, Table 4).&#13;
3.06    Ministry of Agriculture. Project support to the Ministry of Agriculture would encompass the&#13;
following two sub-components:&#13;
(a) National Agricultural Census (base cost US$3.7 million; 5 percent of base cost). In&#13;
order to enable the Directorate of Studies and Coordination (DSC) of the Ministry of&#13;
1/  Support to the GP's regional offices has been included in the cost of the land and water and agricultural roads&#13;
development components.&#13;

Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project                                                       9&#13;
Agriculture to update the agricultural sector information database (para. 2. 06) and create&#13;
a permanent system for agricultural statistics, the project would finance the implementation&#13;
of a national agricultural census (NAC) and the rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing&#13;
statistical services of MOA as well as policy/strategy formulation, marketing and&#13;
comparative advantage studies. More specifically, the project would finance, inter ai&#13;
specialized equipment, such as stereoscopes, aerial photographs, computers as well as survey&#13;
and GIS equipment, 4WD vehicles, 43 person-months of international technical assistance&#13;
and 45 person-months of local consultants and recurrent costs to cover incremental staff&#13;
salaries and staff travel allowances (Working paper No. 4, Table 5).&#13;
(b) Information Management System (base cost US$0.9 million; 1 percent of base cost).&#13;
The objective of the Information Management System (IMS) sub-component is to physically&#13;
gather all the available information in one accessible location, classify this information to&#13;
make it easily retrievable and preserve some documentation onto more compact forms of&#13;
documents. For this purpose the project would finance, inter alia, the procurement of 5&#13;
units of audio-visual equipment, computers and printers, one vehicle, the construction of a&#13;
documentation center at Ghazir or the rehabilitation/completion of an existing center in&#13;
Beirut, technical assistance, and training and staff incentives (Working Paper No. 4,&#13;
Table 6).&#13;
C. Proiect Cost and Financing&#13;
Proiect Cost&#13;
3.07     Total project costs, including physical and price contingencies, are estimated at US$104.8&#13;
million, of which 32 per cent or about US$33.5 million are in foreign currency.&#13;

Financing Plan&#13;
3.09    The proposed Bank loan of US$31 million would meet about 93 percent of the foreign costs.&#13;
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has been approached by the Government&#13;
and has agreed to provide US$12 million, or 11 percent of project costs for the parallel financing of&#13;
terrace-retaining wall construction. Total financing by project beneficiaries would amount to about&#13;
US$48.7 million or 46.5 percent of total project cost. The remaining US$13.1 million or 12.5 percent&#13;
of project cost would be financed by the Government.&#13;

D. Procurement&#13;
3.10    Procurement responsibilities would be vested in the GP and the CDR. The GP would be&#13;
responsible for all procurement, including ICB, relevant to the land and water development and&#13;
agricultural roads components, as well as its own institutional strengthening sub-component. The CDR&#13;
would be in charge of all procurements relevant to the sub-component of MOA's DSC. The GP has had&#13;
extensive experience with implementing small works packages for agricultural roads as well as land and&#13;
water development activities that would be financed by the proposed project. The DSC, however, has not&#13;
had such extensive experience with procurement and would need the support of the CDR and the&#13;
institutional strengthening planned under the project. All goods and works to be financed from the&#13;
proceeds of the Bank's loan would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under Bank Loans and IDA Credits. The procedures to be adopted are detailed in Annex 1, Appendix 3.&#13;
E. Disbursements&#13;
3.11    The proposed Bank loan of US$31 million would be disbursed against the categories and at the&#13;
rates indicated in Table 3.3 below. Disbursement would be made against full documentation, except for&#13;
payment against contracts of less than US$150,000 equivalent for goods, US$100,000 for works,&#13;
US$50,000 for mechanized works for land and water development, US$100,000 equivalent for services&#13;
with consulting firms and US$50,000 equivalent for services with individual consultants (including training&#13;
and studies), which would be reimbursed against statement of expenditures (SOEs). Documentation&#13;
related to SOEs would be retained by the GP and the CDR, each for the activities for which it has&#13;
implementation responsibility. Given the long interruption in lending to Lebanon, there is no disbursement&#13;
profile for the country. The implementation period for the project is estimated at six years. The proposed&#13;
disbursement profile closely follows the disbursement for the on-going Irrigation Rehabilitation and&#13;
Modemization Project. Because project funds will be disbursed through two Special Accounts (one for&#13;
the GP and one for the CDR), a disbursement plan for GP and another for the CDR have been formulated;&#13;
they are shown in Annex I, Appendix 4. An estimated disbursements plan for the Bank loan is&#13;
summarized in Table 3.4 below.&#13;
&#13;

3.12      Special Account. To facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures, the Borrower&#13;
would establish two Special Accounts in the Central Bank. The first is to be operated by the GP and the&#13;
second by the CDR; both accounts would be operated under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
The Bank would, upon request, make authorized allocations of US$2.5 million into the Special Account&#13;
of the GP and US$0.3 million into the Special Account of the CDR. Initially, the allocations would be&#13;
limited to US$1.5 million and US$0.2 million for the GP and the CDR respectively. The full authorized&#13;
allocation could be claimed when disbursements reach US$4 million and US$.05 million for the GP and&#13;
the CDR respectively. The GP and the CDR would submit replenishment applications for the Special&#13;
Account on a monthly basis, or when about 20 percent of the initial deposit has been utilized, whichever&#13;
comes first. The replenishment applications would be supported by the necessary documentation, bank&#13;
statement of the Special Account and a reconciliation bank statement of the Special Account against Bank&#13;
records.&#13;

3.13    The GP and the CDR would keep separate accounts for project expenditures in accordance with&#13;
accounting principles and practices acceptable to the Bank. The GP would have ultimate responsibility&#13;
for budgeting and accounting for the land and water development component (para. 3.02), the agricultural&#13;
roads component (para. 3.03) and institutional strengthening sub-components [para. 3.05 (a) and (b)]. The&#13;
CDR would have responsibility for budgeting and accounting and would coordinate project activities&#13;
executed by the MOA's DSC [para. 3.06 (a) and (b)]. Both the GP and CDR would prepare&#13;
reimbursement requests for their respective components and forward them to the Bank, as well as ensure&#13;
that up-to-date information on expenditure and disbursements would be available to the Bank supervision&#13;
missions. Assurances have been obtained at negotiations from the GP and the CDR that they would&#13;
(i) have their proiect records. proiect accounts and proiect financial statements for each fiscal year audited&#13;
in accordance with appropriate auditing principles by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank: (ii)&#13;
fumish to the Bank no later than nine month after the end of each year certified copies of its financial&#13;
statements for such year and the reports of such audits [para. 8.01(fl and (e)il.&#13;
F. Environmental Impact&#13;
3.14     In consonance with O.D. 4.01, the project has been classified under Environmental&#13;
Category "B". The safeguards designed into the project, particularly the creation of the Environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                              Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
Information and Monitoring Committee and the inclusion of environmental considerations as a criteria for&#13;
selecting activities to be supported by the project, would insure that the integrity of natural ecosystems&#13;
and the environment are preserved. Environmental impact assessments would become an integral part of&#13;
all the feasibility studies the GP conducts for land and water developments as well as for agricultural&#13;
roads. The impact of the project on the environment is expected to be positive. Guidelines and&#13;
environmental assessment checklists have already been prepared. More specifically, it is anticipated that&#13;
the project would help ensure that environmental assessmentsto be conducted by the EIMC would become&#13;
part of all feasibility studies and would be implemented as part of the project to mitigate potential negative&#13;
effects on the environment of land and water development as well as agricultural roads (Working paper&#13;
No. 5).&#13;
G. Women's Role in the Proiect&#13;
3.15    Women would have an active role in project implementation and would benefit from its&#13;
assistance. The Government of Lebanon and the agencies involved in the project do not have regulations&#13;
that would preclude women from fully participating or benefiting from the proposed project. In all the&#13;
three institutions involved in the project, women occupy posts of responsibility and have participated in&#13;
the design of the project. As civil service employees, women would be able to actively participate in the&#13;
management and implementation of the project. As potential beneficiaries, women have under Lebanese&#13;
laws the same rights of land ownership as men. As in the past, the GP would continue to provide its cost-&#13;
sharing assistance to beneficiaries regardless of their gender. Under Lebanese law, women are able to&#13;
own and operate businesses and would, therefore, be eligible to bid and receive award of contracts&#13;
financed by the project.&#13;
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
4.01    The project would be implemented by two agencies, the Green Plan and the Council for&#13;
Development and Reconstruction (Annex 1). The GP would play the role of the project management unit&#13;
and be responsible for implementing the land and water development component (para. 3.02), the&#13;
agricultural roads component (para. 3.03) and the subcomponents related to the creation of the&#13;
Environmental Infornation and Monitoring Committee [para. 3.05 (a)] and its own institutional&#13;
strengthening subcomponent [para. 3.05 (b)]. The CDR would play the role of a second project&#13;
management unit and be responsible for the implementation of the institutional support subcomponents&#13;
of the Ministry of Agriculture. These subcomponents include the conduct of the national agricultural&#13;
census [para. 3.06 (a)] and the establishment of an information management system and documentation&#13;
center [para. 3.06 (b)]. To allow for proper staffing and the smooth implementation of the added&#13;
activities brought on by the project, the GP and the DSC of MOA would recruit additional contractual&#13;
staff and where feasible, give additional allowances to performiing staff (as indicated in the detailed cost&#13;
tables for each activity). Implementation arrangements, responsibilities and schedule are detailed in Annex&#13;
1.&#13;
Bank Supervision Missions&#13;
4.02    Review missions would normally be held twice a year, except for the first year when an&#13;
additional project-launch mission would be undertaken immediately after project effectiveness.&#13;
Supervision missions would normally take place when semi-annual reports have been produced by the&#13;
Borrower's agencies (after March and September of each year). Staffing of project-launch and supervision&#13;
missions during the first year of the project would include the Task Manager (Agriculturist), a Civil/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project                                         13&#13;
Irrigation Engineer, a Soil and Water Conservation Specialist, a Statistician, an Economist and a&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist and would require a total input of about 20 staff-weeks. Further&#13;
details are available in Annex 1.&#13;
B. Monitorin! and Evaluation (M&amp;E)&#13;
4.03    The M&amp;E of project achievements would be the responsibility of the GP and the CDR (see&#13;
Annex 1, Section C). The CDR M&amp;E report would be based on information gathered and reports&#13;
submitted by the DSC. Project M&amp;E activities would have the two-fold objective of generating&#13;
information on progress of implementation and on the achievement of project developmental objectives.&#13;
Key monitoring indicators are detailed in Annex IV.&#13;
V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION&#13;
5.01    The activities to be financed under the proposed project would influence agricultural production&#13;
in several ways. Land terracing and water harvesting in hill-ponds would be expected to bring about&#13;
increases in: (i) cropping intensity from an average of 30 percent to about 100 percent (Annex VI, Table&#13;
3), arising from land capability upgrading and improved suitability to high value crops and/or multiple&#13;
cropping; (ii) crop yields from an average of 30 to 45 t/ha for tomato, 13 to 18 t/ha for cherries and 23&#13;
to 30 t/ha for apples (Annex VI, Table 4), resulting from better plant growth environments (deeper soils,&#13;
less rocks) and supplemental irrigation with water conserved in hill-ponds. Agricultural roads would also&#13;
bring about increases in: (i) cropping intensity, because early access to farm land and timely crop&#13;
establishment would allow farmers to plant most of their landholdings; (ii) crop yields, due to timely crop&#13;
husbandry practices and adequate use of production inputs, particularly fertilizers (Annex VI); and (iii)&#13;
savings in transportation costs as a result of diminished vehicle operation and maintenance costs. The&#13;
Agricultural census would allow the Ministry of Agriculture to formulate sector policies based on reliable&#13;
information and more attuned to prevailing sector conditions. Changes in cropping patterns and yields&#13;
between the without-project and with-project situations have been captured in crop and one-hectare farm&#13;
models and are summarized in Annex VI and detailed in Working Paper No. 3.&#13;
VI. MARKETING. PRICES AND INCOME&#13;
A. Marketing and Prices&#13;
6.01      No major marketing problems are foreseen for the expected incremental production of the&#13;
project. The expected agricultural production would reach its peak during year 13 of the project and&#13;
would amount annually to about 14,000 t of green-podded almonds, 47,000 t of apples, 29,000 t of&#13;
cherries, 11,000 t of olives, 10,000 t of apricots and about 65,000 t of vegetables. Wheat production&#13;
would decline by about 2,600 t annually. Import statistics indicate that many types of agricultural produce&#13;
including tomatoes are being imported for processing within Lebanon.  Much of the anticipated&#13;
incremental production would be easily absorbed within the domestic market, which is expected to require&#13;
more high-value agricultural produce as a result of the gradual increase in per capita income and the&#13;
growth of the population. A substantial share of the almond, apple and cherry incremental production is&#13;
expected to be exported to the Asian, East European and Gulf market. With few exceptions (wheat,&#13;
tobacco and sugar beets), prices are market responsive and it could be argued that production is, to a large&#13;
extent, determined by market forces and reflects Lebanon's competitive edge. This is particularly the case&#13;
for most fruit and vegetable crops grown in the project area. At present, prices of agricultural output do&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
not differ considerably from their respective world market levels. On the input side, there are no subsidies&#13;
on fertilizers, pesticides or farm machinery. The local prices of fertilizers are slightly above world market&#13;
prices. The list of farmgate prices for agricultural outputs and inputs is given in the financial and&#13;
economic Working Paper No. 5.&#13;
B. Incomes&#13;
6.02      Levels of farn  income vary considerably with farm  size, agro-ecological region and&#13;
production technologies used by farmers. On the basis of crop models designed to approximate the real&#13;
costs of production and crop returns, one-hectare farm models were prepared for each of the five regions&#13;
of Lebanon in order to estimate the farm-level benefits that would accrue as a result of the project. An&#13;
analysis of these farm models indicates that incomes, in all farm sizes, can be expected to increase&#13;
significantly. In areas where land and water development would take place, present incomes for all types&#13;
of farms are quite depressed. This is due to the fact that most of the land is currently either in fallow and&#13;
out of production (70 percent) or is cropped to subsistence wheat (30 percent), whose income after labor&#13;
costs is insignificant. With the project, the production capability of lands would be significantly upgraded&#13;
and the income they would generate at full development would become similar to that of rich lands of the&#13;
Bekaa plain or the costal areas of Lebanon. During the first five years after investing in land and water&#13;
developments and even with the GP's assistance, farm income would be negative. Farm income would&#13;
start to cover annual production costs beginning in year six of the project. However, at full development&#13;
(year 13), income after labor cost would become relatively high. In North Lebanon, income of a one-&#13;
hectare wheat farm is expected to increase from LP 67,000 (US$42.0) to LP 6.3 million (US$3,980.0)&#13;
when it is planted with fruit trees. In Mount Lebanon the expected increase would reach LP 14.7 million&#13;
(US$9,245.0), and in South Lebanon the increase would reach LP 9.0 million (US$5,660.0). Financial&#13;
Internal Rates of Return (IRR) have been calculated for one-hectare fruit farns in the five regions of&#13;
Lebanon; they are 20.3 percent for North Lebanon, 30.4 percent for Mount Lebanon, 59.3 percent for&#13;
South Lebanon, 21.2 percent for Bekaa North and 36.2 percent for Bekaa South. Incomes of farms to&#13;
which access would be improved by the roads built under the project would increase significantly as a&#13;
result of increased yields and improved cropping intensification (details are in Working Paper No.3).&#13;
Vll. BENEFITS, ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries&#13;
7.01      The primary benefits of the project would be the incremental agricultural production, the&#13;
improved management and conservation of land and water resources, savings on transportation costs and&#13;
an updated agricultural sector database. The incremental agricultural production would result from the&#13;
sustainable development of land and water resources in mountainous areas and increased agricultural&#13;
productivity of lands to which access was improved by the construction of agricultural roads. The&#13;
improved management and conservation of land and water resources would be brought about by the&#13;
terracing and consolidation of eroded steep-lands, the storage of runoff water in small hill-ponds and a&#13;
better interaction between development objectives and environmental concerns.  The savings in&#13;
transportation costs would materialize as a result of reduced vehicle and maintenance costs. The updated&#13;
agricultural sector database would result from the conduct of a national agricultural census and the&#13;
establishment of a permanent sector data updating system.&#13;
7.02      Overall project incremental production at full development would be substantial and would&#13;
include about 65,000 metric tons of vegetables and 111,000 metric tons of fruit. Because the area devoted&#13;
to rainfed wheat would be planted to higher-value fruit tree crops, the production of wheat grain would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project                                          15&#13;
be reduced by about 2,600 metric tons per year. About 1,300 families would benefit from the agricultural&#13;
roads and 8,300 farm families would benefit from the land and water development activities. In total,&#13;
about 9,600 farm families or about 75,500 people would profit directly from the project (Annex VI,&#13;
Table 2). Poor farmers with small land holdings of less than 0.5 ha would be targeted by the GP through&#13;
local committees. The project would reduce the isolation of rural villages through rural road development,&#13;
and thereby reduce one of the motives for rural-urban migration. Other benefits, highlighted by the&#13;
communities consulted during the participatory process, are better access to work sites, improved health&#13;
conditions (by improving travelling conditions for emergency cases), improved comfort of transportation,&#13;
and easier access to schools. The need for link roads is most strongly expressed by villages where farmers&#13;
still rely on small paths, which only allow animal transit to market their produce or to purchase products&#13;
from the towns. Construction or rehabilitation of rural roads would also lead to a reduction of transport&#13;
costs, and to savings in transportation and travelling time.&#13;
7.03      Environmental benefits and impact.  The project would contribute to environmental&#13;
protection through reduced soil erosion and improved water conservation as a result of land terracing and&#13;
hill-ponds construction. The farming systems proposed are less destructive than the present systems and&#13;
should result in reduced erosion and general land and water degradation. Some increase in the use of&#13;
artificial fertilizers and pesticides is envisaged. However, overall usage rates would be low and would be&#13;
applied more efficiently following improved extension advice. To assure protection of the environment,&#13;
surveys to be conducted by the EIMC and check lists covering environmental aspects would become an&#13;
integral part of feasibility studies of all GP activities (para. 3.05).&#13;
B. Economic Analysis and Justification&#13;
7.04      The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy for Lebanon and is explicitly&#13;
mentioned among the objectives and instruments of the CAS. The project would support the Government&#13;
policy for development of rural infrastructure currently implemented by the GP. Through the project,&#13;
public sector investment would assist private farmers in developing land that is potentially suitable for&#13;
agriculture but is currently left idle, or cultivated with very low intensity, due to slope, rockiness and/or&#13;
lack of rural roads. Public sector involvement in cost sharing of land terracing and water storage on&#13;
private land is justified by the targeting of poor and remote rural areas with few economic development&#13;
alternatives and by the long-term impact of those infrastructures on the preservation of the natural&#13;
environment.&#13;
7.05      Design Alternatives. The financial profitability of the proposed crops and investments has&#13;
been assessed for five agro-ecological zones. Detailed crop and farm budgets (Working Paper No. 3) have&#13;
been calculated utilizing FARMOD on the basis of the full land reclamation and development costs,&#13;
including Green Plan share of the financing. Although land terracing costs are highly variable depending&#13;
on local conditions such as land rockiness and slope, financial rates of return are only moderately sensitive&#13;
to variations in the cost of land development. This is due to the fact that land reclamation costs are&#13;
relatively modest in comparison with on-farm negative cash flows that farmers must face in the early years&#13;
of establishment and maintenance of perennial crops. Stone wall terraces have been selected as the most&#13;
appropriate solution for mountainous and rocky areas (slope above 20 percent), while cheaper earth&#13;
embankments would be acceptable for areas with slopes under 20 percent. Regarding water storage, earth&#13;
hill-ponds costing on average US$1 per m3 of storage, have been selected as the most economical&#13;
alternative in mountainous areas.&#13;
7.06      Economic Analysis. An economic analysis has been carried for individual roads [results are&#13;
in Annex III (b)] to be constructed during the first two years of the project and for the whole project&#13;
(Annex III (b)], taking into account incremental agricultural production benefits to be derived from land&#13;
reclamation and rural roads construction and savings in vehicle operating cost resulting from the rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                 Agriculture Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
roads. On-farm cost and benefit streams are based on aggregated crop budgets and activity models used&#13;
in the financial analysis and on the phasing of land reclamation and rural roads. The project's net benefits&#13;
are calculated by deducting the without project net benefits, which have been assumed to remain constant&#13;
over time.&#13;
7.07      The project cost streams are based on economic project costs, excluding taxes and price&#13;
contingencies. Civil works have been costed at likely contract prices, and imported equipment has been&#13;
costed at CIF prices. Considering that there are no restrictions on the trade of goods and services, that&#13;
the Lebanese Pound is freely convertible, and that domestic markets are generally free from price&#13;
distortions, no conversion factor has been applied to the project investment cost streams, and the economic&#13;
analysis has been carried out taking into account the prevailing exchange rate of US$ I = LLI,590 as&#13;
of February 1996. Further details on the methodology and assumptions of the economic analyses are&#13;
available in Working paper No. 3. The main fiscal impact of the project will result from incremental&#13;
maintenance costs of agricultural roads. These costs would amount to about US$460 thousand per year&#13;
at full development.  All other operation and maintenance costs of land terracing and irrigation&#13;
infrastructure will be supported entirely by the farmers.&#13;
7.08      The overall rate of return of the project, calculated over a 30-year period, is about 24 percent.&#13;
The project is expected to generate a net present value of about US$119 million discounted at the&#13;
opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. Considering that only agricultural production benefits and&#13;
savings on transport costs from the roads have been taken into account in the analysis, this suggests that&#13;
the project is economically viable. The project would also bring other social, environmental and&#13;
institutional benefits which cannot be readily quantified.&#13;
C. Proiect Risks and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
7.09      Project Risks and Sensitivity Analysis. The project could face two major risks. The first&#13;
is at the individual farmer level and is related to the uncertainty of achieving anticipated agricultural&#13;
benefits in a timely manner. This would be caused by potential delays in the completion of agricultural&#13;
investments by farmers, poor maintenance of orchards and possible fluctuations in product prices. As in&#13;
the past, this risk would be mitigated during the selection of project beneficiaries by giving first priority&#13;
to farmers who plan to complete the entire investment within two years of completion of works for which&#13;
GP assistance was obtained. Before receiving the GP's assistance, farmers would commit themselves in&#13;
writing to complete the investment within two years. Failing that, they would reimburse to the treasury&#13;
the financial assistance they received from the GP. In addition, the past 30 years' experience on which&#13;
the present project is built show that, in reality, this risk is minimal and that most farmers complete their&#13;
investments on time and maintain their orchards properly. The risk of fluctuation in product prices cannot&#13;
be mitigated entirely. The second potential risk is related to the maintenance of agricultural rural roads,&#13;
which used to be a problem during the period of civil strife. During negotiations. it was agreed that local&#13;
budgetarv resources would be made available by the Borrower to maintain the roads built by the GP [para.&#13;
8.01 (h)]. In the long-term, the significant allocation of funds made to the Muhafazats offices (Governors&#13;
offices) and Deputies of the various regions of Lebanon for the specific purpose of roads maintenance&#13;
would ensure the adequate maintenance of agricultural roads. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the&#13;
economic analysis is relatively sensitive to assumptions made on on-farm benefits. The ERR would be&#13;
reduced to 12 percent by a decrease of 26 percent in farm benefits. However, because the assumptions&#13;
made on crop yields are quite conservative, the probability that the accrued benefits would be lower than&#13;
those assumed is considered low. On the other hand, the economic results of the project are quite resistant&#13;
to variations in project cost; investment cost would have to increase by 36 percent to reduce the ERR to&#13;
12 percent.&#13;

THE LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Implementation Arrangements and Schedule&#13;
A. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
1.       The project would be implemented by two agencies, the Green Plan and the Council for&#13;
Development and Reconstruction. The GP would be responsible for implementing the land and water&#13;
development component (SAR para. 3.02), the agricultural roads component (SAR para. 3.03) and the&#13;
subcomponents related to the creation of the Environmental Infornation and Monitoring Committee [SAR&#13;
para. 3.05 (a)] and its own institutional strengthening subcomponent [SAR para. 3.05 (b)]. The CDR&#13;
would be responsible for the implementation of the institutional support subcomponents of the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture. These subcomponents include the conduct of the national agricultural census [SAR para.&#13;
3.06 (a)] and the establishment of an information management system and documentation center [SAR&#13;
para. 3.06 (b)]. The GP and CDR would be in charge, each with regard to the components under its&#13;
responsibility, of developing annual work plans. clearing annual work plans with the Bank, procurement.&#13;
disbursement of project funds. keeping proiect accounts and reporting on the progress of their components.&#13;
To allow for proper staffing and the smooth implementation of the added load of activities brought on by&#13;
the project, it was agreed that the GP and the DSC of MOA would recruit additional contractual staff and&#13;
give salary incentives to deserving staff (as indicated in the detailed cost tables for each activity).&#13;
The Green Plan&#13;
2.        The GP would have full responsibility for the implementation of the land and water&#13;
development and agricultural roads components. For both of these demand-driven activities, the GP would&#13;
continue to deal with potential beneficiaries' requests for assistance on the basis of existing procedures&#13;
(appendix 1). It would be responsible for overall planning, evaluation and monitoring of all the project&#13;
activities for which it is responsible. It would also be in charge of conducting technical, socio-economic&#13;
and environmental feasibility studies and designs either by its own staff or through the use of consultants.&#13;
When requests for assistance are received from farmers or from rural communities, the GP's regional&#13;
offices would conduct the necessary preliminary studies and include the request in the waiting list. Each&#13;
project year starting in 1997, the GP's regional offices would formulate action programs detailing the&#13;
required budget and the activities they plan to implement during the following year. These action&#13;
programs would be consolidated, verified and approved by the GP's Executive Committee. The GP would&#13;
submit semi-annual reports in March and September of each year to report on project progress and inform&#13;
on its annual Programs for land and water development and agricultural roads. The GP would submit in&#13;
the semi-annual report (due in September) of each proiect year. starting in 1997, the consolidated action&#13;
program for land and water development of the following calendar year to the Bank for review and&#13;
clearance [para. 8.01 (i)]. Disbursement for the 1997 land and water development activities would be&#13;
approved with the clearance, at project effectiveness, of the 1997 action program. Disbursement for&#13;
subsequent years would be approved when annual action programs for land and water development are&#13;
cleared by the Bank in september of each year, starting in September, 1997. For agricultural roads, and&#13;
since the first two-year program has already been appraised, disbursement for this program can proceed&#13;
as soon as the project becomes effective. Disbursement for subsequent years would be approved when&#13;
annual action programs for agricultural roads are cleared by the Bank in March of each year, starting in&#13;
1998. The GP would submit. in its semi-annual report of March of each proiect year. starting in 1998,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
the consolidated action program agricultural roads for the following calendar year to the Bank for review&#13;
and clearance [para. 8.01 (i)].&#13;
3.        The selection of activities to be financed by the project and the identification of farmers and&#13;
communities that would receive the GP's cost-sharing assistance would be done according to current GP&#13;
procedures and a set of agreed criteria. A new pilot procedure would be tested at various locations to&#13;
improve the targeting of project benefits towards the poor; this pilot procedure is described in para. 4&#13;
below. Assurances have been obtained at negotiations that the GP would select land and water&#13;
development activities and agricultural roads on the basis of criteria acceptable to the Bank. For land and&#13;
water development, the criteria are: (i) land terracing and development not to take place in areas where&#13;
the slope is above 40 percent and rockiness exceeds 60 per cent of soil cover; (ii) beneficiaries of GP&#13;
assistance to commit themselves to finance and complete remaining development investments within two&#13;
years of works implemented through GP assistance; (iii) GP not to assist in land and water development&#13;
in areas intended for urbanization or industrial development; (iv) GP not to assist in land development on&#13;
national forests and protected bio-diversity areas or in areas within 500 meters of these forests and&#13;
protected areas; (v) a minimum Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 12 per cent [para. 8.01 (c)]. For&#13;
agricultural roads, these criteria would include: (i) the beneficiary population would participate in sharing&#13;
the cost of the roads by voluntarily giving, without compensation, the land on which the road would be&#13;
constructed; (ii) road design and alignment to take into account, inter alia, the mitigation indicated in the&#13;
environmental assessment summary checklist of the road feasibility study; (iii) a minimum Economic Rate&#13;
of Return (ERR) of 12 per cent; and (iv) responsibility for road maintenance would be assumed by the&#13;
Borrower and local budget allocations secured before roads are constructed [para. 8.01 (d)].  In&#13;
undertaking the required environmental reviews, and in addition to conducting its own flora and wildlife&#13;
studies for specific agricultural roads, the EIMC would make use of available information (from UNDP&#13;
and UNEP Projects) that describes the distribution, status and significance of natural and agricultural&#13;
biodiversity in Lebanon.&#13;
4.        According to current GP policy, project financial resources would, in principle, be divided&#13;
equally among the four regions of Lebanon (North Lebanon, Mount Lebanon, South Lebanon and the&#13;
Bekaa). However, it was agreed that the GP executive committee may allocate up to 20 percent more&#13;
resources to regions where farmers' demand for assistance are high. It was further agreed that within&#13;
regions, the GP's regional offices would target needful villages and communities, and that within targeted&#13;
villages and communities, the Green Plan would work with local committees to prioritize the poor and&#13;
target project assistance to those most in need. The participation and involvement of populations through&#13;
elected representatives (municipalities, cooperatives, village associations, etc.) would be used by the GP's&#13;
regional offices to increase their capacity to identify and target needful families. Representatives of&#13;
populations would, for example help to: (i) differentiate between farmers who rely on farming to make&#13;
a living from those who have additional sources of income; and (ii) determine which potential&#13;
beneficiaries of the project are the poorest. However, project activities would benefit the Lebanese&#13;
farming population at large and would not be focused exclusively on the poor.&#13;
The Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR)&#13;
5.        As indicated above, the CDR would have full responsibility for the implementation of the&#13;
components aimed at strengthening the Directorate of studies and Coordination of the MOA [SAR para.&#13;
3.06 (a) and (b)]. The CDR would have responsibility for contracting the technical assistance necessary&#13;
for the execution of the national agricultural census by the DSC. The CDR is in the process of negotiating&#13;
a contract with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations to provide assistance&#13;
to the DSC in the execution of the planning and preparatory phase of the agricultural census. MOA has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 3 of S&#13;
expressed a preference for the FAO, which may be awarded a new contract under the AIDP financing,&#13;
to provide TA to DSC for the implementation of phases 2 and 3 of the census. In addition, the CDR&#13;
would provide advice and support to the GP (as requested by the GP) in the preparation, evaluation and&#13;
execution of procurement through ICB procedures. The CDR has the capacity to undertake these functions&#13;
through its existing Program Management Unit (PMU) established under the Bank-financed Emergency&#13;
Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project. In case the PMU ceases to exist, the CDR would put in place&#13;
alternative implementation arrangements that are satisfactory to the Bank. Tender process and contracting&#13;
for the construction and equipment of the Ghazir center would be undertaken by the CDR. For ease of&#13;
operation, procurement of items with a value of less than US$10,000 equivalent would be implemented&#13;
directly by the DSC under delegation from the CDR.&#13;
The Directorate of Studies and Coordination (DSC)&#13;
6.        The DSC of the Ministry of Agriculture would be responsible for the field execution of the&#13;
National Agricultural Census and the establishment of a permanent system for agricultural statistics&#13;
including the creation of the Information Management System (IMS) and documentation center at Ghazir.&#13;
The DSC would require a significant amount of Technical Assistance (TA) for the implementation of the&#13;
Census. This TA would be procured by the CDR for the DSC under one package. The permanent system&#13;
for agricultural statistics would evolve from upgrading the capacity of the existing statistical service within&#13;
the DSC. Information gathering for the census would be undertaken by enumerators hired by the DSC;&#13;
they would be supervised by existing MOA staff and by incremental contractual staff to be recruited under&#13;
the project. The processing of the census data and cross-tabulations would be executed on computer&#13;
systems purchased under the project. The analysis of the data and publication of the census results would&#13;
be the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture. The DSC would also be responsible for the&#13;
execution of the IMS and the operation of the documentation center at Ghazir. Detailed designs for the&#13;
Ghazir center are already under preparation by architects working for MOA. In September of each proiect&#13;
year starting in 1997. the DSC would prepare an annual action program for the agriculture census and IMS&#13;
activities planned for the following calendar year. This annual action program would then be submitted&#13;
for review and clearance by the Bank. through the CDR [para. 8.01 (1)].&#13;
Coordination Arrangements&#13;
7.        A Proiect Coordination Committee (PCC) would be established. The CDR would establish&#13;
a committee to coordinate the implementation of the subcomponents related to the provision of&#13;
institutional support to the DSC [para. 8.01 (m)]. It would meet twice a year in March and September&#13;
to review project progress and to sanction the annual action plans and progress reports prepared by the&#13;
DSC and the consultant providing the technical assistance to the execution of the agricultural census. The&#13;
PCC would be headed by a representative of the CDR and would include a member of the DSC of MOA.&#13;
In addition, there is an imperative need to ensure that a consensus exists among the concerned agencies&#13;
and users of agricultural statistics, including the private sector and academia, on the methodology and&#13;
goals to be achieved by the proposed national agricultural census. For this purpose, the MOA would&#13;
maintain the recently created Agricultural Census Steering Committee, which would be responsible for&#13;
reviewing and approving the statement of obiectives and methodologv of the proposed census as well as&#13;
for the supervision of the data analysis and publication of the census results [para. 8.01 (n)]. The&#13;
committee is headed by the Director General of Statistics (in the Office of the president of the Council&#13;
Of Ministers) and its executive secretariat is assured by the Director General of MOA. In order to&#13;
coordinate land and water development activities and agricultural roads and optimize environmental&#13;
benefits, the GP would coordinate its proiect activities with MOA's Directorate of Rural Development and&#13;
Natural Resources, the Ministry Of Environment (MOE) and NGOs [para. 8.01 (m)]. This committee&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
would be headed by the Chief of the GP's Environmental Information and Monitoring Committee (EIMC)&#13;
and include representatives from MOA, the MOE and NGOs such as the Muawadh Foundation.&#13;
B. Implementation and Supervision Plan&#13;
8.        The project would be implemented over a six-year period. An implementation schedule is&#13;
given in Appendix 2. The 70 km-program of agricultural roads already defined would be implemented&#13;
during the first two years of the project (SAR - Annex III). For land and water development and&#13;
rehabilitation activities, farmer and community requests for which studies have been completed by the end&#13;
of March of each year would be implemented during the spring and summer of that year. For agricultural&#13;
roads and during the first year of the project, studies, designs and tender documents would be completed&#13;
for the agricultural roads to be implemented in year 3 of the project and their bidding procedure would&#13;
be completed in year 2 of the project. In years 2 and 3 of the project, designs and bidding process would&#13;
be completed for the year-4-program of roads. The IMS of the DSC and the agricultural census would&#13;
be completed in years 3 and 5 respectively. Phase one of the census ( development of methodology,&#13;
planning and staff training), under financing from the on-going Bank-financed Irrigation Rehabilitation&#13;
and Modernization Project, would start during the second half of 1996. Phase two (methodology,&#13;
recruitment of staff, conduct of census) and phase three (data inputting, analysis and publication of results)&#13;
of the census would be financed under the AIDP and would take a total of 4 years to complete.&#13;
Borrower Contribution&#13;
9.        The GP and the CDR would be responsible for coordinating the arrangements for review&#13;
missions by the Bank and other co-financiers and for providing the information required by missions. At&#13;
least one member of the GP's executive committee and the Director of the DSC would accompany review&#13;
mission to the field and participate in project reviews. Semi-annual Rrogress reports would be submitted&#13;
at the end of March and September of each proiect-year by the GP for its activities and by the MOA's&#13;
DSC (through the CDR). These reports would focus on: (i) the status of physical progress in agricultural&#13;
roads, land and water development and institutional support activities, including the conduct of the&#13;
agricultural census etc.; (ii) the status of award of contracts for civil works and procurement of goods; (iii)&#13;
progress in the conduct of studies, designs and tendering of works and activities to be implemented during&#13;
the coming semester; (iv) the status of technical assistance, studies and training; (v) brief summary of&#13;
information on various key project monitoring indicators; (vi) the annual work program and budgetary&#13;
requirement for local funds; (vii) the status of the Bank disbursement, including pending withdrawal&#13;
applications and project expected disbursement for the following semester; (viii) a summary of actions&#13;
taken in response to issues raised during the previous supervision mission; and (ix) the status of other&#13;
issues, such as legal covenants, accounts and audit and project staffing.&#13;
Bank Supervision Missions&#13;
10.       Review missions would normally be held twice a year, except for the first year when an&#13;
additioiial project-launch mission would be undertaken immediately after project effectiveness.&#13;
Supervision missions would normally take place when semi-annual reports have been produced by the&#13;
Borrower's agencies (after March and September of each year). Staffing of project-launch and supervision&#13;
missions during the first year of the project would include the Task Manager (Agriculturist), a Civil&#13;
Engineer, a Soil and Water Conservation Specialist, a Statistician, an Economist and a Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation Specialist and would require a total input of about 20 staff-weeks (sws) for the first year. For&#13;
subsequent supervisions, the inputs of a Civil/Roads Engineer, an Agriculturist and a Statistician would&#13;

to the project by the technical assistance component. A mid-term review of all project activities would&#13;
be conducted jointly by the GP, the CDR, the DSC, the Bank and IFAD. In preparation for the mid-term&#13;
review, the GP and the CDR, assisted by the DSC, would prepare a detailed report for submission to the&#13;
World Bank by December 31, 1999; the mid-term review would take place in March, 2000. In addition&#13;
to the above, an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be prepared by the GP and the CDR and&#13;
submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the project completion date. Assurances have been&#13;
obtained at negotiations that the GP and the CDR would each submit: (i) a detailed progress report for&#13;
the mid-term review by December 31, 1999; and (ii) an Implementation Completion Report not later than&#13;
six months after the proiect completion date [para. 8.1 (n)].&#13;
C. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E)&#13;
11.      The M&amp;E of project achievements would be the responsibility of the GP and the CDR (the&#13;
CDR M&amp;E report would be based on information gathered and reports submitted by the DSC). Project&#13;
M&amp;E activities would have the two-fold objective of generating information on progress of&#13;
implementation and on the achievement of project developmental objectives. For the GP-executed&#13;
activities, implementation progress would be assessed on the basis of achievement per region of the annual&#13;
work program targets in terms of number of km of roads constructed, number of hectares terraced, number&#13;
of m2 of retaining stone wall constructed, etc. Periodic surveys would be carried out to monitor the use&#13;
of terraced and developed lands, production performance and farm incomes. For the DSC-executed&#13;
activities, implementation progress would be assessed on the basis of the completion of various phases of&#13;
the NAC and the establishment of the IMS and documentation center at Ghazir. A set of monitoring&#13;
indicators are listed in Annex 3. The GP and the CDR would include in their respective semi-annual and&#13;
annual progress reports information on key target indicators and analyze project constraints giving&#13;
proposals for their resolution.&#13;

THE LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJET&#13;
Green Plan Current Procedures&#13;
1.      Since its inception, the Green Plan has adopted a demand-driven approach to the conduct of its&#13;
activities. The GP focussed specifically on the development of privately-owned lands and on improving&#13;
access to isolated rural areas. To implement its mandate, it enters into a partnership with farmers, to share&#13;
with them the cost of land development and natural resources conservation activities.&#13;
2.      The procedure used by the GP to serve the rural communities is relatively simple. For land&#13;
terracing and water resources conservation, requests for assistance are made by individual farmers by&#13;
completing a standard form provided by the GP. When the budgetary resources are likely to become&#13;
available, the development proposal is reviewed by the GP's regional staff (between January and March&#13;
of each year) and if approved goes to GP headquarters, where it is verified and signed by the GP's&#13;
executive committee members. The approved and signed request is then reviewed, as are all requests for&#13;
assistance submitted to the GP, by a resident auditor (controleur financier) from the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(MOF). Before the works start (usually in May of each year), farmers are informed of their share of the&#13;
financing and are requested to deposit the calculated amount at the treasury. After receiving the treasury&#13;
deposit slip, the GP proceeds with hiring contractors (for mechanical works such as earth moving and&#13;
ripping) or allowing farmers themselves to initiate the manual works (such as terrace retaining wall&#13;
construction, concrete reservoir construction and tree planting). Mechanical works for land terracing are&#13;
awarded to private contractors through advertised tenders indicating the price the GP would pay for the&#13;
earth moving works under various conditions. Interested contractors come to GP headquarters and are&#13;
given through mutual agreement a contract for works in a given region. After completion of the works&#13;
contractors are paid directly by the GP.&#13;
3.      With respect to agricultural roads, farner groups (20 to 30 farmers per km of road, i.e. about&#13;
30 ha of agricultural land) or communitie organize themselves and make a written request to the GP for&#13;
an agricultural road. In their request, farmers inform the GP that they donate the land on which the road&#13;
would be constructed. With the request in hand, the GP's regional office conducts a preliminary study and&#13;
alignment of the road and verifies with local authorities, communities and with the farmer group itself the&#13;
needs, commitment and feasibility of the road. Once this is confirmed, the proposed road is included in&#13;
the waiting list. When funds become available, proposed roads are entered in the work program on a first-&#13;
come, first-served basis. Their feasibility and design study is given to private consulting firms and the&#13;
GP starts the process of voluntary expropriation of the lands on which the road would pass. When all&#13;
farmers agree to give up their share of the land for the road, a presidential decree is issued for the&#13;
expropriation. The road designs are verified by the GP staff, who prepare bid documents and advertize&#13;
and tender the works on a competitive system. Past experience indicates that after the road is constructed,&#13;
beneficiary communities who have supposedly committed themselves to its maintenance, are usually&#13;
unable to honor their commitments. Until recently, the GP was not mandated or funded to maintain the&#13;
agricultural roads it builds. As a result, many of the roads built in the past are in urgent need of repair.&#13;
The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) has the responsibility and would maintain all the agricultural roads&#13;
that would either connect two existing secondary roads or lead to a village. For the remaining "non-&#13;
classified" agricultural roads, the GP needs to receive before negotiations, a clear mandate from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

concerned Ministries for their maintenance. The financial costs of road maintenance have been included&#13;
in the project.&#13;
4.       Present Cost-Sharing Arrangements. Under present cost-sharing arrangements, farners&#13;
participate by sharing with the GP the costs of land development and conservation (land terracing,&#13;
retaining walls construction) and water resources mobilization and conservation (hill ponds, concrete&#13;
reservoirs, localized irrigation systems). For agricultural roads, farmners participate by donating free of&#13;
charge the land required for the road. Under these arrangements, all farmers who can produce the required&#13;
proof of ownership (or a seven-year lease of titled land) of the land they wish to develop, are eligible to&#13;
receive a grant from the Government through the GP. The main features of present cost-sharing&#13;
arrangements between Government (Green Plan) and beneficiary farners are as follows:&#13;
(a) A one-time aggregate ceiling amount per farmer of LL10 million (US$6,289). This&#13;
total amount can be drawn upon in one or several installments and applies throughout the&#13;
farmer's entire lifetime; and&#13;
(b) Farmer's contribution is related to the total cost estimate of the development work he&#13;
wants to undertake.&#13;

THE LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
AGRICULTURE INERASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJET&#13;
Procurement&#13;
1.       Procurement responsibilities would be vested in the GP and the CDR. The GP would be&#13;
responsible for all procurement, including ICB, relevent to the land and water development, agricultural&#13;
roads and its own institutional strengthening sub-component. The CDR would be in charge of all&#13;
procurements relevant to the sub-component of MOA's DSC. The GP has had extensive experience with&#13;
implementing small works packages for agricultural roads as well as land and water development activities&#13;
that would be financed by the proposed project. The DSC, however, has not had such extensive&#13;
experience with procuremea1t and would need the support of the CDR and the institutional strengthening&#13;
planned under the project. All goods and works to be financed from the proceeds of the Bank's loan&#13;
would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits. The procedures to be adopted are given below and procurement arrangements are summarized&#13;
in the attached table.&#13;
2.        Civil Works. Several procurement arrangements are envisaged: (i) Civil works contracts for&#13;
agricultural roads would generally be of a small size, and even when packaging was possible,would have&#13;
a maximum contract size of about US$0.5 million. These contracts would be scattered throughout the five&#13;
regions of Lebanon and would not attract the interest of international contractors. The rural roads&#13;
component and the documentation center building, estimated to cost US$0.35 million, would be&#13;
implemented according to National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures, acceptable to the Bank, using&#13;
standard bidding documents modelled after the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for smaller works.&#13;
(ii) Implementation of the land and water conservation and development component, which consists of&#13;
small and scattered parcels of land terracing and hill reservoir construction, would not be susceptible to&#13;
normal contracting procedures. The current contracting procedures for these works (referred to as&#13;
mechanical works) is to parcel out annual work loads to small individual contractors in each area. The&#13;
cost of each parcel is based on unit rates set up by the GP and finally negotiated with a short list of&#13;
contractors. The GP would introduce the necessary modifications to its current direct contracting practices&#13;
for mechanical works in land terracing and hill-ponds by small local contractors, to make the process&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. To make the process more competitive and transparent, GP would, for works&#13;
implemented under the project, advertize annually and invite contractors to submit bids. The annual&#13;
advertisements would include scope of work in each region and area, volume of works and base unit rates&#13;
proposed by GP. Contractors would return their bids specifying percentage increase or decrease to the&#13;
base rates they would be prepared to accept, equipment available to them, volume of works they would&#13;
be prepared to undertake and areas they would be prepared to work in. Based on the submitted bids, the&#13;
GP would select the lowest evaluated bidders for each region and area and draw up a priority list of&#13;
contractors to award works to. (iii) Construction of stone terrace-retaining walls and concrete basins&#13;
would be implemented by local communities with GP supervision. (iv) Where no suitable arrangements&#13;
for NCB procedures for civil works(land terracing and hill ponds) are possible, construction may be&#13;
undertaken by beneficiaries under Green Plan's supervision and cost sharing arrangements in accordance&#13;
with procedures acceptable to the Bank up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$1.2 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
3.        Equipment and Vehicles. All equipment and materials estimated to cost more than US$0.15&#13;
million equivalent per contract, mainly equipment for surveying, office equipment, computers, audio visual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEXI&#13;
Apvendix 3&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
equipment, GIS equipment, and vehicles (with the exception of the first four vehicles needed to expedite&#13;
project start-up) would all be procured under ICB procedures. For purposes of economy and efficiency&#13;
in procurement, the requirements of the project would, where feasible, be packaged into contracts greater&#13;
than US$0.15 million in value. Lebanese manufacturers competing under ICB would receive a preference&#13;
in bid evaluation in accordance with Appendix 2 of the IBRD Procurement Guidelines. International&#13;
shopping (IS) with at least three quotations from at least two eligible source countries would be used for&#13;
contracts estimated to cost less than US$0.15 million equivalent each, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$0.6 million equivalent. National shopping (NS) would be used for the procurement of off-the-shelf&#13;
items costing less than US$50,000 per contract and for the four vehicles required for project start-up, up&#13;
to an aggregate amount of US$0.30 million equivalent. Direct contracting (DC) would be allowed for&#13;
items of a proprietary nature or items required to ensure compatibility with existing equipment up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$0.10 million equivalent. Seedlings and irrigation equipment would be purchased&#13;
directly by farmers under GP technical supervision and cost sharing arrangements.&#13;
4.        Technical Assistance and Training. Engaging consultants to support project implementation&#13;
agencies and to conduct studies, engineering and supervision work would be in accordance with World&#13;
Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as an&#13;
executing agency (August 1981), using the Bank's Standardized Letter of Invitation (LOI) and sample&#13;
forms of Contract for Consultants' Services. The project would provide for a total of about 120 person-&#13;
months of consulting services of which about 65 person-months would be of local consultants. Training&#13;
services would be obtained mainly through local universities and training institutions or through&#13;
specialized UN agencies.&#13;
5.        Procurement Review. All contracts for goods awarded through ICB and all consultant&#13;
appointments above US$ 50,000 for individual consultants and US$100,000 for firms would be subject&#13;
to prior Bank review. Civil works for rural roads components would be subject to prior review for single&#13;
contracts with a value above US$100,000. Single contracts for mechanized works for land and water&#13;
development with a value of more than US$50,000 are subject to prior review. All other contracts would&#13;
be subject to selective ex-post review by the Bank. It is estimated that these limits would result in prior&#13;
review of about 50 percent of total contract value. This relatively low coverage by prior review is&#13;
justified by the high number of repetitive contracts for land and water conservation and for rural roads,&#13;
as well as a high intensity of post review covering about 40 percent of contract value.&#13;
6.        Procurement Arrangements for CDR Implemented Components on Behalf of Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture. Procurement by the CDR would be undertaken according to Bank guidelines and be&#13;
consistent with the procedure to be followed by the GP where applicable.&#13;

AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
1.       The proposed Bank loan of US$31.0 million would be disbursed against the categories and&#13;
at the rates indicated in table below. Disbursement would be made against full documentation, except for&#13;
payment against contracts of less than US$150,000 equivalent for goods, US$100,000 equivalent for&#13;
works, US$50,000 for mechanized works for land and water development, US$100,000 equivalent for&#13;
services with consulting firms and US$50,000 for services with individual consultants (including training&#13;
and studies), which would be reimbursed against statement of expenditures (SOEs). Documentation related&#13;
to SOEs would be retained by the GP and the CDR, each for the activities for whichit has implementation&#13;
responsibility. Assurances would be obtained that, for all expenses made on the basis of SOEs, the&#13;
Government of Lebanon (GOL) would: (i) maintain or cause to be maintained records and accounts&#13;
reflecting such expenditures; (ii) ensure that all records evidencing such expenditures are retained until&#13;
at least one year after IBRD has received the last audit report; (iii) have the records and accounts of the&#13;
SOEs, including those for the Special Account for each fiscal year, audited by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IBRD; and (iv) furnish to IBRD the audit reports, including a separate opinion on the SOEs,&#13;
no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
2.        Given the long interruption in lending to Lebanon, there is no disbursement profile for the&#13;
country. The implementation period for the project is estimated at six years. The estimate is based on&#13;
the implementation capacity of the CDR and the execution capabilities of the project-supported Green Plan&#13;
and Directorate of Studies and Coordination of MOA. Project implementation would use institutions and&#13;
procedures (with minor modifications) already in place. It is anticipated that disbursements would be&#13;
completed by June 30, 2003, about six months after scheduled project completion. The disbursement&#13;
profile closely follows the disbursement for the on-going Irrigation Rehabilitation and Modernization&#13;
Project. Because project funds will be disbursed through two Special Accounts (one for the GP and one&#13;
for the CDR), a disbursement plan for GP and another for the CDR have been formulated and are shown&#13;
below along with a global disbursement plan.&#13;

the Bank. The Bank would make authorized allocations of US$2.5 million in the special account of the&#13;
GP and US$0.3 million in the Special Account of the CDR. Initially, the allocations would be limited&#13;
to US$1.5 million for the GP and US$0.2 million for the CDR. The full authorized allocation could be&#13;
claimed when disbursements reach US$4 million and US$0.5 million for the GP and the CDR&#13;
respectively. The GP and the CDR would submit replenishment applications for the special account on&#13;
a monthly basis, or when about 20 percent of the initial deposit has been utilized, whichever comes first.&#13;
The replenishment applications would be supported by the necessary documentation, bank statement of&#13;
the special account and a reconciliation bank statement of the special account against Bank records.&#13;

THE LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Analysis, Monitoring and Plan of Action&#13;
1.        The two project components that would have an impact on the environment are the land/water&#13;
development and conservation component, and the agricultural roads component. It is clear that land and&#13;
water development and conservation activities such as land terracing, terrace consolidation, harvesting of&#13;
runoff water in small hill-ponds for irrigation and forest-fire fighting purposes and the use of efficient&#13;
localized irrigation systems would help conserve soil and water resources and have a positive effect on&#13;
the environment. It is also clear that when access to rural areas is improved, populations and, to a certain&#13;
extent the environment, are expected to benefit from these roads. However, the activities under both of&#13;
these project components may also have temporary or permanent detrimental effects on the environment.&#13;
While the positive effects are welcome and expected, the project should guard against causing direct or&#13;
indirect harm to the environment. The objective of this annex is to briefly analyze the environmental&#13;
aspects associated with the implementation of land and water development/conservation and agricultural&#13;
roads components proposed under the project and indicate the actions that would be taken to avoid and/or&#13;
to mitigate potential harmful effects to the environment.&#13;
2         The proposed project would not introduce radically new concepts to land, water and&#13;
agricultural roads development activities in Lebanon, but would support a time-slice of the on-going&#13;
government programs in these fields. Before doing so, however, it is necessary to evaluate the results and&#13;
learn the lessons of past experiences. Land and water development and conservation as well as&#13;
agricultural roads construction activities have been implemented by the Green Plan Authority (GP) since&#13;
its creation in 1964. Since its inception, the Green Plan has adopted a demand-driven approach to the&#13;
execution of its activities. During the past thirty years, the GP has helped terrace about 26,000 ha of steep&#13;
privately-owned land, construct more than 7 million m2 of terrace retaining-walls, 500 hill ponds (average&#13;
capacity 8,000 m3) and more than 3,000 small concrete basins. The GP has also built more than 1,000&#13;
km of agricultural roads. Its global activities benefitted more than 38,000 farmers and about 1,000&#13;
villages scattered all over Lebanon.&#13;
3.        In its project preparation report, the FAO/CP indicates that The GP's past activities have so&#13;
far achieved global positive environmental impact. However, because of the lack of sufficiently detailed&#13;
environmental surveys and monitoring, it is not known whether some GP executed activities may have&#13;
had detrimental effects on the environment. In the FAO/CP report, particular mention is made of some&#13;
potential risks to the environment. These include inter alia the lack of awareness and analysis of&#13;
environmental issues in the studies and designs of agricultural roads and land development activities&#13;
commissioned or executed by the GP; lack of terrace retaining walls in some areas, risk of encroachment&#13;
on protected forest areas, loss of biodiversity, disturbance of archeological sites, encroachment of&#13;
urbanization on land terraced by the GP, potential mis-use of chemicals and fertilizers.&#13;
4.        Under the proposed project a number of actions and safeguards would be put in place to avoid&#13;
or mitigate potentially detrimental environmental impacts. The first, is the creation within the Green Plan&#13;
of an Environmental Information and Monitoring Committee (EIMC) whose role ( working paper No.5)&#13;
would be to, inter alia, systematically include environmental assessments in all studies and designs for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX V&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
land and water development and agricultural roads construction. The EIMC would also formulate&#13;
mitigating measures which would be implemented by the GP or its contractors during the course of project&#13;
implementation. The table below lists the major potential impacts and the mitigating measures that would&#13;
be undertaken by the Project.&#13;
Potential Impact and Environmental Mitigation&#13;
Potential Impact                               Mitigation Measures&#13;
Lack of environmental awareness                Creation of the Environmental Information and&#13;
Monitoring Committee (EIMC) to carry out&#13;
environmental assessments on all agricultural roads as&#13;
well as land and water developments. Financing of&#13;
environmental awareness campaigns through the&#13;
media.&#13;
Lack of terrace retaining walls                Future land and water development studies by GP staff&#13;
to clearly indicate when retaining walls are needed,&#13;
subsequent GP assistance would be conditional on the&#13;
agreement of beneficiaries to complete retaining walls.&#13;
Encroachment on protected forest areas         No GP assistance for land and water development&#13;
within 500 meters of protected or national forest areas&#13;
would be made available to investors.&#13;
Agricultural road alignments would be changed to&#13;
avoid passing through protected areas.&#13;
Loss of biodiversity                           EIMU to ascertain through specific studies that areas&#13;
rich in biodiversity would not be disturbed; assistance&#13;
would be withheld for land and water developments,&#13;
and road alignments would be modified.&#13;
Disturbance of archeological sites             Project assisted works not to be undertaken where&#13;
studies show presence of significant archeological&#13;
sites.&#13;
Contracts for land and water development and road&#13;
construction would require project contractors to stop&#13;
work, inform the GP and archeological authorities if&#13;
works reveal any archeological sites.&#13;
Encroachment of urbanization on lands developed   Project beneficiaries to sign written commitment to&#13;
by the project                                 keep developed land under agricultural production&#13;
until initial investments are recovered or after GP&#13;
assistance is re-reimburse.&#13;
Potential mis-use of chemicals.                Ministry of Agriculture is being supported by Bank-&#13;
financed Irrigation Modernization Project to formulate&#13;
guidelines for the use of pesticides.&#13;
Recommendations on the use of fertilizers can be&#13;
obtained by farmers from private sector suppliers or&#13;
from regional offices of the MOA or the GP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX V&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
5.          Other potential detrimental impacts on the environment would be identified by the environmental&#13;
information and monitoring committee which would also develop appropriate mitigation. The EIMC would have&#13;
responsibility for clearing all studies for land and water development and agricultural roads and would be under the&#13;
direct authority of the GP's Executive committee. Conditionalities would be included in the project legal documents&#13;
in order to limit project interventions to those that are environmental friendly. Assurances would be obtained at&#13;
negotiations that the Government of Lebanon would select land and water develovment activities and agricultural&#13;
roads on the basis of criteria acceptable to IBRD.&#13;
6.          Overall, the impact of the project is expected to be positive. The safeguards designed into the project,&#13;
particularly the creation of the environmental monitoring committee and the inclusion of environmental consideration&#13;
as a criteria for selecting activities to be supported by the project, would insure that the integrity of natural&#13;
ecosystems and the environment are preserved. Terms of reference, guidelines and environmental assessment&#13;
checklists have been produced and are detailed in working paper No.5. More specifically, the project would: (i)&#13;
reduce soil erosion through the construction of new land terraces and the rehabilitation of existing ones; (ii) harvest&#13;
and store potentially-erosive runoff water in small hill-ponds and promoting the use of efficient irrigation methods;&#13;
(iii) help in controlling forest fires by constructing inside forested areas and in collaboration with MOA's Directorate&#13;
of Forestry 20 water-storage ponds; (iv) improve the socio-economic environment in rural areas by contributing to&#13;
job creation, improved incomes and better access to rural areas; and (v) contribute to the formulation of informed&#13;
sector policies, including those related to the management of natural resources, by conducting an agricultural census&#13;
and establishing a permanent statistical system for the agricultural sector in Lebanon.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Agricultural
            Infrastructure Development Project are to: a) develop land
            and water resources for the purposes of increasing
            farmers' incomes and protecting the environment through
            land terracing and harvesting of runoff water in small hill
            ponds; b) increase access to and from isolated rural areas
            through the construction of agricultural roads; and c)
            strengthen the institutional and implementation capabilities
            of the Green Plan and the Directorate of Studies and
            Coordination within the Ministry of Agriculture by upgrading
            their human and material capabilities, financing the conduct
            of a National Agricultural Census and establishing an
            Information Management System to provide the data necessary
            for strategy and policy formulation. The components carry
            out the above mentioned objectives and are, as such: a) land
            and water development; b) agricultural roads; and c)
            institutional support.
