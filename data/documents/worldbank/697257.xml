FOR PUBLIC AND PRrVATE PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
TO THE&#13;
MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT&#13;
1.           Backeround.  After a quarter century of steadily rising incomes, Indonesia's&#13;
economy has become more diversified, less dependent on oil, more industrialized, more urbanized,&#13;
increasingly driven by private initiatives and much more integrated into the global economy.&#13;
Moreover, Indonesia's record on poverty reduction since the mid-1960's has been impressive by&#13;
any international measure. Longer-run development challenges facing the country are now being&#13;
shaped by fundamental structural transformations underway such as (a) the shift from a primarily&#13;
natural resource-based economy to a more human capital productivity-based economy; (b) the&#13;
transition from a largely rural economy to a more urban society, especially in Java, and the&#13;
consequent environmental management, social and infrastructure challenges; and (c) a political&#13;
transition featuring a more open debate of public policy issues and a rethinking of the role of the&#13;
Government, private sector and community organizations.  Enhanced competitiveness and&#13;
poverty reduction through increased deregulation, reduced cost of finance and improved&#13;
infrastructure services are key objectives of Indonesia's development strategy.&#13;
2.           The Infrastructure Sector.   Recognizing the critical role of infrastructure&#13;
development in sustaining rapid economic growth and in reducing poverty during the last 15&#13;
years,  the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has allocated over 40 percent of development&#13;
expenditure to infrastructure, which led to a rapid increase in the infrastructure stock. However,&#13;
high urban and industrial growth rates are outpacing the supply of infrastructure services,&#13;
resulting in a substantial unmet demand. Concurrently, economic diversification and the general&#13;
rise in living standards are leading to an increasing premium on quality, reliability and variety of&#13;
infrastructure services. The investment program for the major infrastructure sub-sectors --&#13;
power, telecommunications, transport, municipal services -- under the current (1994-99) five-year&#13;
plan (Repelita VI) is likely to be about six percent of GDP, or about US$75 billion. This is an&#13;
increase of approximately one percentage point of GDP over Repelita V, and represents a&#13;
reasonable compromise between infrastructure needs and macroeconomic stability. Increasing the&#13;
level of investment in infrastructure will not suffice in itself, and equal importance needs to be&#13;
given to the efficient utilization of assets and achieving the greatest economy in planning and&#13;
construction of facilities and service delivery operations.&#13;
3. .         The quest for cost-effectiveness, coupled with the need to mobilize additional&#13;
financial resources, lies behind the changing role of the Government, particularly at the center,&#13;
from directly supplying most services to relying more on the private sector and markets as well as&#13;
on iocal governments. Like many other developing countries, however, Indonesia is still at an&#13;
early stage in this transition with unclear frameworks for regulation and govemance, fragmented&#13;
institutional responsibilities and a need to update policies, technical standards and financial&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
arrangements. The systemic and cross sectoral nature of these challenges means that the national&#13;
planning agency (BAPPENAS) must pay more attention to strategy design, program evaluation&#13;
and monitoring, in addition to taking a leading role in weaning central ministries away from&#13;
project execution and into policy making and technical advisory functions.&#13;
4.            The vast geographic expanse of Indonesia and the wide disparity in conditions&#13;
across the regions pose a particular challenge for infrastructure development. While the nation's&#13;
fiscal structure implies that central resources will remain important for financing, nevertheless the&#13;
service standards and designs have to be tailored to location specific needs, physical conditions&#13;
and econormic capacities which puts a great premium on effective decision making at local levels.&#13;
As GO5 shit's to wards increased responsibility of local agencies in the planning and delivery of&#13;
services, the latter would need considerable assistance and capacity building to face this new&#13;
challenge.&#13;
5..          Private  financing  will  play  an  increasing  role  in  power  generation,&#13;
telecommunications, water supply, mass transit, ports and toll roads, in order to free public&#13;
resources for other vital needs such as other roads, including rural roads, health and education.&#13;
Of the US$75 billion projected for infras.ructure investment during Repelita VI, about US$21&#13;
billion (28%) is envisaged from private sources. Thus far, enhanced management efficiency has&#13;
not been a driving motivation for GOI to seek increased private sector participation in&#13;
infrastructure. Concessions to date have mostly been awarded after direct negotiations usually&#13;
based on unsolicited proposals. A "deal-by-deal" approach slows progress, adds risk, results in&#13;
high costs and consumes scarce managerial and technical resources; without greater transparency&#13;
and competition, efficiency gains expected from the private sector may not materialize.&#13;
Development of a suitable regulatory framework is therefore critical.&#13;
6.            As economic  activity  and  the  scale  of infrastructure  required  expand,&#13;
environmental sustainability is increasingly an issue, particularly in urban centers and their&#13;
periphery. Population concentration and congestion often mean dealing with difficult resettlement&#13;
issues when building roads, drains or power plants. Effective protection of Indonesia's rich&#13;
natural and cultural resources requires close integration of sound environrnental and social&#13;
practices into standard operating procedures and monitoring of infrastructure projects. Indeed, of&#13;
the five top "brown" concerns identified recently, four -- water supply, sewerage and&#13;
environmental sanitation, solid waste management, and vehicle emissions -- are directly related to&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
7.            Project Obie tives:  The proposed project will assist Indonesia to:  (a) assess&#13;
strategic priorities for reducing infrastructure bottlenecks; (b) develop an updated strategy for&#13;
public-private partnerships and suitable frameworks for private participation in provision of&#13;
infrastructure services; (c) redefine the relative roles of the central and local authorities in the&#13;
identification, preparation and implementation of infrastructure projects; and (d) enhance program&#13;
evaluation capability within BAPPENAS and regional planning bodies and project preparation and&#13;
implementation capabilities (including development of sound environmental and social practices)&#13;
in line agencies and local governments responsible for various infrastructure investments.&#13;
8.           Proiect Description. The proposed project would support the preparation of: (a)&#13;
national sector policies and planning studies; (b) strategies to develop institutions and design&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
regulation to strengthen public/private partnership in the provision of infrastructure services; and&#13;
(c) feasibility studies, engineering designs -- for public projects --, environmental and resettlement&#13;
assessments and remedial plans. It would also include reviews by independent experts of studies&#13;
as well as unsolicited proposals by private investors, and audits of selected major assignments to&#13;
evaluate their impact of institutional development. Finally, it would finance the training of staff of&#13;
the PMU and the various project implementation units (PIUs) in the selection, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of TA  services, project management,  private provision of infrastructure, and&#13;
negotiating techniques. The main focus of TAP4I-2 is on regional planning, power generation&#13;
and distribution, ports, toll roads, transport and communication, water supply and environmental&#13;
sanitation and water resources management (Annex 3).&#13;
9.           Environmental and Social Impact. The proposed project has been classified in&#13;
environmental category C.   It could finance generic studies on infrastructure related&#13;
environmental issues. Also, appropriate provision for the preparation of environmental and&#13;
resettlement assessments and remedial plans consistent with Bank and GOI procedures would be&#13;
incorporated in terms of reference for feasibility studies and engineering designs whenever&#13;
relevant.&#13;
10.         Impact on Poverty. While the proposed project has little direct impact on poverty,&#13;
it will support increased access to basic infrastructure services which has been recognized as a key&#13;
contributor to Indonesia's impressive record on poverty reduction.&#13;
11.          Project Benefits and Risks. The principal benefit of the proposed project would be&#13;
its support to GOI's effort in the provision of sustainable infrastructure services, the strengthening&#13;
of BAPPENAS' focus on strategic issues and the overall decentralization process in project&#13;
preparation. A second benefit would be the continued improvement in the management of T'A&#13;
services resulting from the combination of a pro-active Steering Committee and a competent&#13;
PMU. A third benefit would be the replenishment of the pipeline of adequately prepared and&#13;
bankable infrastructure projects that has become somewhat depleted.&#13;
12.          Risks pertaining to slow appointment of consultants would be minimized by the&#13;
role the PMU would play in providing assistance to the various PIUs. Other risks are that too&#13;
many studies are managed at the central level -- and not enough at the local level -- and that not&#13;
enough attention is devoted to the preparation of feasibility studies and engineering designs for&#13;
infrastructure projects earmarked for public funding. This would be minimnized in part by the&#13;
"marketing" of the available funds and the potential assistance which the PMU would provide to&#13;
decentralized agencies to help prepare infrastructure projects, and in part by regular supervision&#13;
by the Bank, for which an adequate budget would be allocated.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
The Main Infrastructure Sub-Sectors&#13;
1.          Power Sector. Between 1980 and 1990, power generating capacity has nearly&#13;
quadrupled, electricity sales have grown in excess of 15 percent per year and the number of&#13;
connected households and villages have increased by over seven-fold and fourteen-fold&#13;
respectively. Despite this impressive record, many challenges lie ahead. Only about 50 percent of&#13;
villages are served and only around half of the industrial consumption is met by the National&#13;
Power Utility Company, PLN. Repelita VI proposes to increase generation capacity by an&#13;
additional 15,000 MW -- compared with the additional capacity of 4,600 MVW achieved under&#13;
Repelita V -- of which about one third would be financed by private sources. Demand&#13;
management needs to be improved by appropriate pricing policies and other incentives for&#13;
conservation. Also, the mix of public and private supply needs to be optimized through the&#13;
development of a regulatory and policy framework that would maximize the private response&#13;
while protecting the public interest and, within this context, through the progressive&#13;
corporatization and unbundling of PLN.&#13;
2.           Telecommunications Sector. Achievements in telecommunications have also been&#13;
impressive, with new customers connection rate now at 18 percent per year and a significant drop&#13;
in investment cost per connection.  However, demand is still outpacing supply and the&#13;
sophisticated telecommunications services needed for Indonesian businesses to compete in a&#13;
global market are still in their infancy. Repelita VI proposes to create an additional five million&#13;
lines (compared to three million under Repelita V) of which two million would be provided by&#13;
private sources through joint operating companies which are being bid at the present. In addition,&#13;
GOI was recently successful with an initial public offering of its international telecommunications&#13;
company, Indosat, and has also indicated interest in private share offering in the domestic&#13;
telephone company, PT Telkom.&#13;
3.           Transportation Sector.  The capacity, standards and efficiency of Indonesia's&#13;
transport services and infrastructure have improved significantly in recent years as a result of large&#13;
public expenditures coupled with concerted efforts to improve the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework, enhance capabilities of GOI's agencies and facilitate private sector participation.&#13;
Road remains the dominant transport mode and competition among transport operators is&#13;
generally intense. Traffic volumes on many key inter-urban roads are close to their capacities, and&#13;
major investments in widening links or constructing new ones are scheduled under Repelita VI&#13;
either under public or private financing. Road user charges for commercial vehicles remain low,&#13;
thereby impeding efforts to attract traffic to other modes, such as rail, which could potentially&#13;
play a more important role in Java and some other regions. Maritime transport services have also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
improved in recent years as a result of the deregulation of shipping and the corporatization of the&#13;
public port enterprises.  State enterprises continue to dominate the domestic air transport&#13;
subsector, although now private companies are increasing their market shares and GOI is&#13;
considering partial privatization of its flagship company, Garuda.&#13;
4.           Urban Infrastructure. Service coverage has not kept pace with one of the fastest&#13;
growing urban populations and industry in East Asia, in part because the level of public&#13;
investment has been limited to only about 0.4 percent of GDP or four percent of total public&#13;
investment in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Indonesia's urban population rose from 33 million&#13;
in 1980 to 55 million in 1990, i.e. 22 percent and 31 percent of the total population respectively.&#13;
Cities and towns have accounted for some 70 percent of the total population increase during the&#13;
1980s and about 60 percent of non mining GDP comes from urban based economic activities.&#13;
Greater Jakarta -- Jabotabek -- alone was home to 17 million people in 1990 and about 20 percent&#13;
of the Indonesian industrial capacity. Only about 20 percent of urban households have access to&#13;
piped water through house connections, and less than one percent, to public sewers; solid waste&#13;
collection and disposal, drainage and flood control are also grossly inadequate. Operational&#13;
efficiency of water utility companies is generally poor, with about 40 percent of the water&#13;
produced unaccounted for -- more than 50 percent in Jakarta -- and thus generating no revenues.&#13;
Understandably, Repelita VI gives high priority to water supply -- an additional 22 million people&#13;
should be connected to the piped system -- drainage and kampung improvement. However,&#13;
investment programs for the water supply sector are not ready and decisions on key major&#13;
investments -- such as sewerage in Jakarta -- have been delayed. GOI is seeking ways to involve&#13;
private operators to improve water supply operations and to provide additional financing,&#13;
although there is still room for increased self financing through user fees. Opportunities for&#13;
private sector participation in waste collection are also being pursued. Although significant&#13;
resources have been allocated to urban roads and transport, congestion is mounting rapidly, and&#13;
Repelita VI also gives high priority to mass transport in larger cities and air pollution reduction.&#13;
5.           Village Infrastructure. Although the Government has invested considerable sums,&#13;
e.g. in rural roads, infrastructure at the sub-district level remains deficient: access to many villages&#13;
is poor with some being cut-off during the rainy season, and drinking water and sanitation&#13;
services are scant. Investment needs at the subdistrict and village level are addressed through the&#13;
GOI's poverty reduction program, other small GOI programs and self-help schemes. The OECF&#13;
and the Bank are assisting with village level projects to provide infrastructure needed in some of&#13;
the poorest villages through grants and implementation by the villagers. The TAP4I-1 helped&#13;
finance preparation of the Bank's project which started implementation recently.&#13;
6.           Bank Lending for Infrastructure. Since 1986, the Bank has financed 23 projects in&#13;
the power, telecommunications, road urban and rural infrastructure sectors for about US$4,900&#13;
million.&#13;

SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
Project Management, Work Program, Procurement, Disbursement,&#13;
Reporting, Accounts and Audits&#13;
1.          Project Management. The proposed project would be implemented under the&#13;
overall responsibility of the Project Management Unit (PMU) established under BAPPENAS by&#13;
decree KEP./KET/6/1994 dated April 2, 1994, replacing decree 593/KET/1993 dated June 2,&#13;
1993. TAP4I-PMU consists of:&#13;
(a)   a Steering Conmmittee chaired by the vice-chairman of BAPPENAS and comprising&#13;
senior staff from BAPPENAS and other relevant line Ministries responsible for the&#13;
identification and implementation of sub-projects aimed at the public and private&#13;
provision of infrastructure services. Its role is mostly to provide overall guidance&#13;
on implementation of TAP41 and to select the various sub-projects proposed by&#13;
the Project Implementation Units (PIUs);&#13;
(b)   an Executive Team comprising senior staff from the same ministries, responsible&#13;
for daily implementation of the various sub-projects, and&#13;
(c)   a Project Director and Treasurer responsible for overall project implementation.&#13;
This position is filled in by an expert staff from BAPPENAS and is attached to the&#13;
position of expert staff. The Project Director is assisted by an expatriate technical&#13;
adviser and a local administrative team. The expatriate technical adviser,&#13;
administrative team, office rental and operating costs would be financed by the&#13;
proposed loan, as it is the case under the first project.&#13;
2.          The PMU has developed a Project Implementation Manual (PIM)  which&#13;
standardizes all activities related to the preparation of Project Documentation Packages (PDPs)&#13;
and Terms of Reference (TORs), the evaluation of proposals, the negotiations of fees with&#13;
selected consultants, the contracting procedures and the monitoring of sub-projects. The PIM,&#13;
available in the project files, has been reviewed during appraisal and found acceptable. In&#13;
particular, it is consistent with the Bank guidelines for the "Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981).&#13;
3.          Annual Work Programs. The PMU would firnish to the Bank for review annual&#13;
studies and training programs starting not later than September 30, 1996. Such work programs&#13;
would include a brief description of the studies and training activities proposed, together with an&#13;
outline of the TORs, preliminary budget and implementation schedule, and a clear indication of&#13;
the PIU responsible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
page 2 of 3&#13;
4.          Procurement of TA Services. Consultant services will be procured in accordance&#13;
with the above mentioned Bank guidelines and PIM. In particular, fee levels and overhead&#13;
expenses will be negotiated to reflect the nature and length of the assignment and level of&#13;
expertise required. Also, TORs, budgets, shortlists, selection procedures, letters of invitation,&#13;
proposals, evaluation reports and contracts would be subject to Bank's review and approval for:&#13;
(a)   all contracts estimated to cost above US$100,000 equivalent or more with&#13;
consulting firms or US$50,000 equivalent or more with individual consultants;&#13;
(b)   all training activity to cost US$50,000 or more;&#13;
(c)   assignrnent considered critical by the Bank for Expert Review Panels or the expert&#13;
review of unsolicited private investment proposals.&#13;
5.          Procurement of Equipment. Office equipment to be purchased under TAP4I-2&#13;
amount to about US$250,000 equivalent. Equipment would be procured in accordance with the&#13;
Bank Guidelines for the Procurement of Goods and Works (January 1995).&#13;
(a)   goods estimated to cost more than US$50,000 equivalent per contract may be&#13;
procured under contracts awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding;&#13;
(b)   goods estimated to cost US$50,000 equivalent or less per contract and&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent or less in the aggregate may be procured under contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of National Shopping procedures;&#13;
(c)   the PMU would submit a proposed procurement plan when the proposed loan&#13;
becomes effective and update it in its quarterly monitoring reports; and&#13;
(d)   the PMU would furnish to the Bank for review the standard bidding document to&#13;
be used for the procurement of equipment under National Competitive Bidding&#13;
and National Shopping procedures prior to initiating the bidding process.&#13;
6.          Disbursement. Disbursement percentages for each category are given in Schedule&#13;
B to the Memorandum of the President. In order to facilitate disbursements under the proposed&#13;
Loan, a Special Account in the amount up to US$2.8 million would be established in Bank&#13;
Indonesia. This Account should be maintained by the Directorate General of Budget in the&#13;
Ministry of Finance.  The Special Account would be used for all eligible expenditures.&#13;
Replenishment applications to the Special Account should be submitted to the Bank on a monthly&#13;
basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever comes first.&#13;
7.          Disbursement Procedures.&#13;
(a)   Disbursements from the Loan for contracts for goods exceeding US$100,000&#13;
equivalent, consulting firms exceeding US$100,000 equivalent, individual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
page 3 of 3&#13;
consultants and training activities exceeding US$50,000 equivalent will be made&#13;
against full documentation.&#13;
(b)   All other disbursements would be made against Statement of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs), for which relevant documents would be retained by responsible agencies,&#13;
and made available for review as requested by visiting Bank missions.&#13;
8.          Reporting. The PMU would prepare and submit quarterly progress reports on a&#13;
format similar to the one used for the first project.  In order to properly monitor project&#13;
implementation and achievement, the following performance indicators would be used:&#13;
(a)   number of requests received from the PrUs and processed by the PMU; initiatives&#13;
taken by the PMU to attract suitable requests, in particular in the provinces;&#13;
(b)   man days of training provided; evaluation of the training by the participants;&#13;
(c)   elapsed time in procurement of TA services; adherence of PIUs to procedures of&#13;
the PIM.&#13;
9.          Audits of Accounts. The PMU would maintain separate project accounts in a form&#13;
satisfactory for annual audit. These accounts, including the Special Account would be audited&#13;
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and will include opinions on all&#13;
expenditures, including those made against SOEs. The PMU would submit the audited accounts&#13;
to the Bank for review not later than six months after the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
10.         Technical Audits. Annual technical audits, in accordance with current practices in&#13;
Indonesia, are not practical for this technical assistance project. During negotiations, it was&#13;
agreed that (a) technical audits of selected completed sub-projects and training programs would&#13;
be carried out, in accordance with TORs satisfactory to the Bank, to review performance and&#13;
institutional development impact of these sub-projects and training programs; and (b) promptly&#13;
after completion of said audits, the PMU would furnish to the Bank the recommendations&#13;
formulated by the auditors.&#13;

SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVISION OF ENFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
Outline of Terms of Reference&#13;
of Key Activities&#13;
1.          As of end March 1995, the various PrUs had submitted to the PMU requests for&#13;
about 40 sub-projects that could benefit from financing of the proposed loan.  Sub-project&#13;
description sheets have been screened by the TAP4I Steering Comrnittee. Among the sub-&#13;
projects that have obtained a favorable review, nine sub-projects totaling about US$16.0 million&#13;
are in an advanced stage of preparation and have sufficiently detailed TORs. Full PDPs are now&#13;
being prepared by the PIlUs, with the PMU's assistance, and are scheduled to be ready in July&#13;
1995 and furnished to the Bank for review and approval. Proposals from consultants could be&#13;
invited as soon as the loan is approved; with streamlined evaluation and contracting procedures&#13;
that have been developed under the first project, these sub-projects could actually start during the&#13;
first quarter of 1996, i.e. three to six months after loan effectiveness.&#13;
2.          In addition, BAPPENAS and the Coordinating Ministry for Economy and Finance&#13;
have expressed during appraisal their willingness to rapidly launch a coordinated exercise to help&#13;
develop an adequate framework for the development of public/private partnerships (PPP) in&#13;
infrastructure. This would include the review and the revision of existing laws and regulations&#13;
and the preparation of standard solicitation procedures and contracts. TORs for this sub-project&#13;
are being prepared. It is expected that this sub-project can be launched during 1996.&#13;
3.           TA to be Initiated during the First Year of Project Implementation. Below is a&#13;
summary description of the sub-projects that are ready to be launched during the first year of&#13;
implementation of the proposed project. More detailed descriptions are available in the project&#13;
files. Since these sub-projects were all initiated by the respective departments and their agencies,&#13;
there is a heavy representation of technical analysis, physical planning and economic evaluation of&#13;
major infrastructure programs.  In addition to reviewing their development priority and&#13;
consistency with stated GOI objectives, Bank input in their formulation will pay particular&#13;
attention to (a) environmental and social aspects are properly reflected in the scope of work; and&#13;

page 3 of 4&#13;
it is envisaged to conduct decentralized training sessions for senior official of several provinces on&#13;
the above topics.&#13;
4.            Other Sub-Projects Identified. Further rigorous review by the Steering Committee&#13;
is needed for approximately 30 other applications received by the PMU, to eliminate duplication&#13;
of previous work, establish clear ownership and commitment and of course ensure consistency&#13;
with the national development objectives. In particular, TORs need to be refined to ensure&#13;
effective and implementable results while maintaining a strategic context. Further effort will be&#13;
made to see if management of these sub-projects could be decentralized to regional entities. PDPs&#13;
for these sub-projects are expected to be finalized during the first year of project implementation,&#13;
with the assistance of individual consultants contracted under TAP4I-1 for this specific purpose.&#13;

5.           While maintaining  the primacy of demand  driven  sub-projects, the PMU&#13;
particularly through its Steering Committee, will identify key systemic constraints inhibiting&#13;
efficiency in public investments or effectiveness of private provision of infrastructure, design&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
page 4 of 4&#13;
suitable sub-projects to address and market them to appropriate agencies. A significant part of&#13;
the Bank supervision effort is expected to support this, particularly during the first year of&#13;
implementation. Through the proposed project and associated Bank instruments (e.g. IDEF,&#13;
PHRD grants), the Bank also expects to respond to recent high-level Government requests made&#13;
to senior Bank management including inter-alia (a) a senior policy colloquium followed by a&#13;
public conference on managing and regulating enhanced private sector participation in major&#13;
infrastructure projects; (b) support for domestic consulting industry; and (c) development of&#13;
