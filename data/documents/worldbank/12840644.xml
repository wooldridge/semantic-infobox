pivotal role in Peru's behavior change journey. They engage&#13;
other partners to broaden the reach of the project and&#13;
share tools that contribute to consistent messaging. They&#13;
also train master trainers, who, in turn train the front-line&#13;
workers--principally health care providers, local community&#13;
development workers, and teachers (Figure 6). As a result&#13;
of the partnership building process, roles and commitments&#13;
are defined. Front-line workers employed by partners (public&#13;
and private institutions, including local governments, national&#13;
and local social programs, NGOs, mining companies,&#13;
and agriculture export firms) integrate the IPC program            At a training workshop, teachers and health agents learn about&#13;

            Peru - Global Scaling Up Handwashing
            Project : a handwashing behavior change journey
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In 2003, a national multi-sectorial
            Handwashing Initiative (HWI) was created in Peru to increase
            handwashing with soap among mothers and children. The early
            years of the HWI focused on laying groundwork, including a
            formative research study in 2004; the creation of a
            consultative committee by the Ministry of Health (MoH); and
            a national decree formalizing the HWI. The Water and
            Sanitation program (WSP) has coordinated the HWI since its
            inception. This learning note profiles the behavior change
            component of the second phase with a focus on how it was
            designed, implemented, and monitored. Challenges and lessons
            learned are included to assist program managers as they make
            decisions to develop and manage a handwashing promotion
            initiative. Peru provides an interesting case study because
            the intervention itself is interwoven with efforts to
            strengthen capacity, policies, partnerships, and other
            aspects of the enabling environment required to sustain
            handwashing with soap programs. Though detangling these
            various program components is a challenge, this note on the
            behavior change journey attempts to do so.
