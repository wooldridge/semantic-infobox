                                THE WORLD BANK&#13;
                                   April 11, 1995&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Welcome back, Stephen. I would like to begin by asking you to talk a little bit&#13;
&#13;
about your time in the Agriculture Projects Department, in particular your work with Jim&#13;
&#13;
Evans, the head of the department. What exactly did you do, and what kind of a person&#13;
&#13;
was he? How effective do you think he was in running the Agriculture Department?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, I worked in the front office on two occasions. Let me mention here&#13;
&#13;
parenthetically that throughout my career Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always had the problem that when I was at&#13;
&#13;
the operational end I always complained about policy, and when I was on the policy side of&#13;
&#13;
things I always complained about why people would not want to carry out oneâ&#128;&#153;s policies&#13;
&#13;
and I would long to get back to somewhere where one can try things out in the real world.&#13;
&#13;
So I yo-yoed back and forth and I worked twice on the policy-making side in the&#13;
&#13;
agriculture department. The first assignment, which was planned, was to work with Jim&#13;
&#13;
Evans very closely on rewriting a number of policies and looking at a number of items.&#13;
&#13;
For example, I can remember writing a piece on agricultural credit, specifically our control&#13;
&#13;
of the reflows to the credit institutions we supported. We were lending money to a credit&#13;
&#13;
institution on terms of up to 30-40 years in the case of IDA credits, or for a 15-, 20-, 25-&#13;
&#13;
year term in the case of Bank loans. Yet, the credit institutions would extend loans for a&#13;
&#13;
four or five year term, and in the case of crop credits even for one year, and was able to&#13;
&#13;
relend the money again. We had no policy or had not even thought through what the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 2&#13;
&#13;
implications of this were for the Bank in terms of supervision and control of the reuse of&#13;
&#13;
our funds. So I did a piece of work on that issue for Jim Evans. I must have done about a&#13;
&#13;
dozen similar assignments as well as just helping out in emergencies. But I only did that&#13;
&#13;
for about a year, partly because I was losing patience with doing policy-type work. It can&#13;
&#13;
be interesting to work on a particular problem, but it was very frustrating getting all the&#13;
&#13;
people to agree. I left probably prematurely because my batting average with Jim Evans&#13;
&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t more than about 60 percent. Probably six out of ten of the things that I did and that&#13;
&#13;
led me to conclude that we ought to make some changes, we would do. And that didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
seem to me to be high enough. I did not have enough rapport with him to make it&#13;
&#13;
worthwhile continuing. So I left to be deputy division chief in one of the divisions in the&#13;
&#13;
department.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     What kind of a person was Jim Evans? Was he a bit of a constipated bureaucrat?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Oh, no. No, no, no. He was very conservative. Not in the sense of not accepting&#13;
&#13;
new ideas, because if he didnâ&#128;&#153;t take on new ideas we wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have become anything, we&#13;
&#13;
would have just stayed where we were. As it was, we were constantly branching out into&#13;
&#13;
new things and growing. So, he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t conservative in that sense. He was very&#13;
&#13;
conservative in a, in a personal sense, in an ethical sense that one could admire. In that&#13;
&#13;
way, he was very conservative. But he liked things to be done properly, he didnâ&#128;&#153;t like to be&#13;
&#13;
stampeded or bamboozled by people who he thought were too smart for their own and the&#13;
&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s interest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               2&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 3&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Did these people include Mr. McNamara?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes, these people eventually included Mr. McNamara, and me, I guess. But thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
neither here nor there. He wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a tremendous risk taker. He would take on new things,&#13;
&#13;
but he would take them on in a measured fashion. Where he was a bit of a bureaucrat was&#13;
&#13;
on administrative matters, on things like the size of missions he could be very strict.&#13;
&#13;
       Where he got into trouble was really not something of his own fault, it was more a&#13;
&#13;
flaw in the organizational set-up at that time. Just to give you a concrete example of a&#13;
&#13;
situation where he got into trouble, which I thought was inevitable. In the days before&#13;
&#13;
1972, you had agriculture for the whole world and you had five or six area departments in&#13;
&#13;
charge of country relations. They were run by Mr. Knapp in the broadest sense. But Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Knapp was never prepared to differentiate or adjudicate between country departments if&#13;
&#13;
there was a conflict. So you found an isolated projects department, like agriculture, with&#13;
&#13;
demand far exceeding its capacity for service. We might have, say, 60 projects to work on&#13;
&#13;
at any one time, genuine projects with definite need for Bank assistance, but we only had&#13;
&#13;
the ability to process 40. Then it was up to Jim to determine which 40 projects to work on&#13;
&#13;
without any mechanism to resolve the competing claims of area departments. He couldnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
go to Mr. Knapp and say: "You look after all six departments. Tell me which projects you&#13;
&#13;
want me to work on." So what Jim used to do, he sent the list of the 60 projects to all the&#13;
&#13;
country departments first of all and asked them to let him know which were of high and&#13;
&#13;
which of low priority so that we can pick the 40 which we can actually handle. Chances&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              3&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 4&#13;
&#13;
were that he would get back 60 plus high priority projects, the 60 we started with, plus&#13;
&#13;
maybe 10 or 15 or 20 new ideas. Nothing was ever of low priority. Burke Knapp would&#13;
&#13;
not rule, so in the end - I think the reason why I remember this is because I was given the&#13;
&#13;
task once to help out on this - we would have to make the decision on the 40, which was&#13;
&#13;
really not our job because we didnâ&#128;&#153;t know the relative country situation. We just looked at&#13;
&#13;
it from an agricultural point of view, and to pick what seemed the most interesting,&#13;
&#13;
reasonable balance across subsectors and across the divisions of the department. But these&#13;
&#13;
were decisions which we should not have been making, and this was where Jim got into&#13;
&#13;
trouble. We would make our list of 40, and weâ&#128;&#153;d send that list around to everybody. We&#13;
&#13;
would say to those people: "Look, it is not our job to do this." I remember writing this&#13;
&#13;
very specifically: "It is not my job to do this. But here is my 40, because I have to get&#13;
&#13;
started. If any of you country directors tell me that within your country group Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got the&#13;
&#13;
wrong selection, you tell me and I will make changes accordingly, because itâ&#128;&#153;s your job to&#13;
&#13;
do that, and I am willing to comply. If you tell me that the projects I have included should&#13;
&#13;
not be included because one Iâ&#128;&#153;ve left out is of higher priority, then I will accept your&#13;
&#13;
decision. But if you just want to add to your projects, I canâ&#128;&#153;t do it unless you bring in&#13;
&#13;
another country director somewhere else who is willing to give up one of his projects." The&#13;
&#13;
response from the area departments was zero, literally zero. We would not get a response,&#13;
&#13;
and we would proceed to work on the 40 we had chosen. And then poor Jim was being&#13;
&#13;
criticized by country directors as being dictatorial, as being totally inflexible and without&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               4&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 5&#13;
&#13;
any sense of the countriesâ&#128;&#153; real needs. I thought he got a very bad wrap, but he was too&#13;
&#13;
much of a gentleman to be as rude as I would have been in the circumstances. And in that&#13;
&#13;
sense, he was ultra-conservative because he would not argue the case. He got a bad&#13;
&#13;
reputation as a result, I think, totally undeserved. I suppose he did lack imagination and did&#13;
&#13;
not see the big picture. In that sense, he was not providing leadership, setting the direction&#13;
&#13;
for our work, and let things drift.&#13;
&#13;
       The second time I went to work in the front office was immediately prior to the&#13;
&#13;
1972 reorganization. This was a different kettle of fish altogether. I'd only been in my first&#13;
&#13;
management assignment for probably a year, a year and a half, something like that, when&#13;
&#13;
Jim appeared in my office and said: "I know you don't want to do it, but you are coming&#13;
&#13;
back to the front office." He said, "This is not a request, this is a command." The reason&#13;
&#13;
was that the Agriculture Department had just produced the first draft Agriculture Policy&#13;
&#13;
Paper. In fact, it was the first Sector Policy Paper of any sector produced. I had had&#13;
&#13;
nothing to do with its first draft, which had gone up to the senior councils of the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
particularly Warren Baum; I'm not sure if Burke Knapp saw it at that stage, but Warren&#13;
&#13;
Baum certainly. And it had been pilloried, and Jim Evans was told that it was badly&#13;
&#13;
written, badly thought through, not pointing anywhere, just a list of experiences to date.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Who had written this paper?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Who had written it? I'm not sure. Jim Henry, I presume, along with Shig&#13;
&#13;
Takahashi and Willi Wapenhans who must have been involved. How many others and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               5&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 6&#13;
&#13;
how much Jim Evans himself did, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know. Jim may have written certain paragraphs&#13;
&#13;
himself, but he certainly took the overall responsibility for it. Now it was my job, I was&#13;
&#13;
told, to come in and rewrite it, which I spent six months doing, almost six months. I can't&#13;
&#13;
remember exactly how much time I spent on this because when we got started we got tied&#13;
&#13;
up with the reorganization and many had to move out. That was really one of the first&#13;
&#13;
times in my Bank career where I disliked my work, I really positively disliked what I had&#13;
&#13;
to do. It was one of about a couple of experiences where I positively disliked what I was&#13;
&#13;
doing. The reason wasn't that the subject was not interesting, it was because the same&#13;
&#13;
authors who had put their hearts into the first draft, had been told it was a lousy job, but&#13;
&#13;
had not been put in charge of rewriting it. Instead, a young, relatively inexperienced young&#13;
&#13;
guy had been brought in to rewrite it, who could certainly improve the English, but whose&#13;
&#13;
own personal experience in agriculture was at that stage still limited by the amount of&#13;
&#13;
experience one had. I had to take the draft to pieces, try and bolster it up in thought,&#13;
&#13;
because this where it was thought to be lacking, reorganize it, and present it in a more&#13;
&#13;
coherent policy way, which I did. It was eventually published in 1972. It was the first one&#13;
&#13;
of the little pamphlets on sector work, sector policy that the Bank published outside. It was&#13;
&#13;
in reasonable shape, but I wouldn't say more than that.&#13;
&#13;
       But the problems that I would have in doing this job were tremendous. I would&#13;
&#13;
rewrite a paragraph or a section and I would take it in to Jim and he would say: "Well, yes,&#13;
&#13;
this reads very well, but that whole paragraph 57, I wrote that myself, and I really liked&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               6&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 7&#13;
&#13;
that. Couldnâ&#128;&#153;t we bring this back into the text?" And that happened all the time. So any&#13;
&#13;
interest that I had in the opportunity to pull it all together, which was for me quite&#13;
&#13;
interesting because this was the first time I had done any sector type thinking in&#13;
&#13;
agriculture, that interest was seriously affected by the resistance to any change. In the end&#13;
&#13;
I got something that was reasonably satisfactory to me. Knowing very well that the 12th&#13;
&#13;
Floor, whatever it was called in those days, actually wanted the paper changed, I felt fairly&#13;
&#13;
strong in being able to actually do what I wanted. So in some cases, I just didnâ&#128;&#153;t do what I&#13;
&#13;
was told. Sometimes I would argue with Jim and say: "I donâ&#128;&#153;t understand." I would say to&#13;
&#13;
him: "I donâ&#128;&#153;t understand the logic or your position." And we would argue it a bit and&#13;
&#13;
wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t convince me. In the end he would say to me: "Well, youâ&#128;&#153;ll just have to accept my&#13;
&#13;
judgment on the matter. Itâ&#128;&#153;s just the foibles of an old man." This happened a number of&#13;
&#13;
times and it used to irritate me a great deal that, that I would find a person who was the&#13;
&#13;
director of the Agriculture Department of the World Bank who could not articulate in a&#13;
&#13;
way that was satisfactory to me why indeed we were doing things in a particular way.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     But you were also in contact with Warren Baum at that time?&#13;
&#13;
A:     I donâ&#128;&#153;t think I had much, if any, day-to-day contact. It was just a matter of&#13;
&#13;
attending occasional meetings. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t have any long contact there.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     So he didnâ&#128;&#153;t tell you directly what he thought needed to be done?&#13;
&#13;
A:     No. In fact, I wasnâ&#128;&#153;t even present at the meeting at which the report had been&#13;
&#13;
criticized. I saw the minutes of that. I read them. But you didnâ&#128;&#153;t need the minutes of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               7&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 8&#13;
&#13;
meeting, I mean, you could read the draft and you understood what was wrong. It was not&#13;
&#13;
a satisfactory product to go out of the Bank, it did not necessarily involve disagreement on&#13;
&#13;
any substance. There were no substantive issues over the direction that we should follow&#13;
&#13;
in our agricultural work. It was just that the paper didnâ&#128;&#153;t make any sense as a coherent&#13;
&#13;
whole and did not establish any sector policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: I guess with this we move to the reorganization of 1972.&#13;
&#13;
which all of a sudden finds you as Program Coordinator in EMENA. Now, how did you&#13;
&#13;
become Program Coordinator?&#13;
&#13;
A:     By a series of misfortunes, I guess. I had been slated for a job which I didnâ&#128;&#153;t want.&#13;
&#13;
The same thing happened to me in 1967, but this one turned out a bit more successfully.&#13;
&#13;
There wasnâ&#128;&#153;t much choice in 1972. Appointments were just announced, as you may&#13;
&#13;
remember. Jim Evans, to give him his credit, advised me ahead of time what was in store&#13;
&#13;
for me. What was in store for me was to have been the assistant to the new Director of&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture. In the new set-up, as you know, agriculture was dispersed, as were all the&#13;
&#13;
other sectors, into five or six regions. How many regions were there? Four? Five?&#13;
&#13;
Q:     There were five, I think.&#13;
&#13;
And the new Director of the Central Agriculture Department was supposed to be Sir John&#13;
&#13;
Crawford.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              8&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 9&#13;
&#13;
A:     Crawford, yeah. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s a side issue which, if you havenâ&#128;&#153;t got that story already&#13;
&#13;
on record, I can give you my version of that. But at the stage where I was told that I was&#13;
&#13;
going to be the assistant to the director, it was Hans Adler who was going to be the Deputy&#13;
&#13;
Director to Sir John, and it would mean working with Hans Adler most of my time. Sir&#13;
&#13;
John Crawford was only going to be there for a minimal amount of time each year, and the&#13;
&#13;
vast majority of time I would be spending with Hans Adler. Hans Adler had come from, I&#13;
&#13;
do not know where, to be the third assistant director in the Agriculture Department under&#13;
&#13;
Jim, and I thought he was a cuckoo, and it was well known that I thought he was a cuckoo,&#13;
&#13;
and Jim Evans also knew that I thought he was a cuckoo. I think he shared my view that&#13;
&#13;
he was a cuckoo. And when he saw that the plans had me going to be his assistant, to&#13;
&#13;
produce the continuity from the old to the new, and knowing my dislike for working in&#13;
&#13;
front offices in the first place, he could see me not liking this assignment at all - even&#13;
&#13;
though it was supposedly a good one, working with Sir John occasionally - and so he&#13;
&#13;
thought he would tip me off about what was going to happen. He knew exactly what I&#13;
&#13;
would do, which was to use my contacts to see if I could get something else. And this is&#13;
&#13;
what I did.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Now, what was the story about Sir John Crawford, because later I think he even&#13;
&#13;
claimed that he had never agreed to accept this assignment at all, that his name had been&#13;
&#13;
put on the organization chart totally without his knowledge and his agreement? The matter&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               9&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 10&#13;
&#13;
had been discussed with him presumably, and he may have said: "Iâ&#128;&#153;ll think about it," but he&#13;
&#13;
had never agreed to take that job.&#13;
&#13;
A:     That is my understanding as well. I never talked to Sir John about this, and&#13;
&#13;
therefore everything I tell you is hearsay. On the other hand, I was fairly close to those&#13;
&#13;
who were involved. Certainly Sir John was selected by McNamara as being the person that&#13;
&#13;
he wished to be the Director of the Agriculture Department, and Siem Aldewereld was&#13;
&#13;
given the task of telling Sir John that heâ&#128;&#153;d been selected and arranging that he would agree&#13;
&#13;
to be selected. I believe that Siem Aldewereld went so far as to fly to Honolulu to intersect&#13;
&#13;
with Sir John, who worked a lot in South Asia and Australia, where he lived. They met in&#13;
&#13;
Honolulu, so I am informed, to discuss this possibility, at which Sir John made it clear,&#13;
&#13;
even by Siemâ&#128;&#153;s own record, that he could not afford to give up all the other things he was&#13;
&#13;
doing in the world to become the sole full-time director of the department. That seems to&#13;
&#13;
be a given.&#13;
&#13;
       But then the stories diverge. Siem came back with what he thought was an&#13;
&#13;
agreement that Sir John would accept the position of Director, it being understood that he&#13;
&#13;
could only work three, four, five months a year for the Bank in that capacity, which was&#13;
&#13;
why I said a minute ago, Hans Adler was put in as the only Deputy Director in the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
and I was to be placed as his assistant to provide continuity while he was away, and that&#13;
&#13;
Sir John would do other things for the other eight months. Itâ&#128;&#153;s obvious with hindsight that&#13;
&#13;
all Sir John had agreed to was to allocate four or five months of his time every year to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              10&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 11&#13;
&#13;
Bank business, but not to be director of a department because you canâ&#128;&#153;t do that if you are&#13;
&#13;
only there for four or five months, you are not the director. Anyway, obviously Siem&#13;
&#13;
thought he had got an agreement and therefore the documentation came out with Sir John&#13;
&#13;
Crawford announced as the Director of the Department.&#13;
&#13;
       Nothing happened for a while because this notice did not seem to have reached Sir&#13;
&#13;
John. As far as I know, the way it reached him, was through an Australian lady by the&#13;
&#13;
name of Helen Hughes, who was in the Industry area and went on home leave to Sydney or&#13;
&#13;
wherever. In the course of her home leave, she attended a dinner party at which Sir John&#13;
&#13;
was a guest, and at this dinner party Helen congratulated him on his appointment. Sir John,&#13;
&#13;
having a large number of appointments, because there was, hardly a month went by before&#13;
&#13;
he was not appointed to some other commission or got a degree, simply said: "Thank you&#13;
&#13;
very much, Helen," without really inquiring which particular appointment it was, and she&#13;
&#13;
was not very specific. But according to Helen, by the time the dinner ended, it became&#13;
&#13;
clear that there was some misunderstanding around, so Sir John actually asked her: "What&#13;
&#13;
appointment are you talking about?" And then Helen told him, and the next thing that I&#13;
&#13;
know, and this I did see because I was in the front office of the old Agriculture&#13;
&#13;
Department, it had not physically decentralized, it had not physically broken up yet. A&#13;
&#13;
Telex arrived from Sir John, from somewhere in the world, saying that he had understood&#13;
&#13;
that it had been announced that he was the Director, and that he had neither been offered&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             11&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 12&#13;
&#13;
nor sought nor agreed to such a position, and would somebody please make amends. So&#13;
&#13;
they did.&#13;
&#13;
        Thatâ&#128;&#153;s all I know about it. And as a result, they started looking around for&#13;
&#13;
somebody else. They had to ask Jim Evans, which caused them considerably heartburn,&#13;
&#13;
but they had to ask Jim Evans to stay on for I think almost a year extra before they found&#13;
&#13;
Montague Yudelman to take the job.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Did Jim Evans resign or was he more or less told that there was no place for him in&#13;
&#13;
this new organization? Do you know?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I donâ&#128;&#153;t know which of those it was. It cannot have been a terribly unfriendly&#13;
&#13;
arrangement, because otherwise I canâ&#128;&#153;t imagine that Jim would have agreed to stay on in&#13;
&#13;
the hold-over position. So my guess is that there was an element of both, but an agreement&#13;
&#13;
must have been reached in a fairly amicable way.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now, how did you manage then, given that you had this forewarning, to turn&#13;
&#13;
yourself into a program coordinator?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I looked around for the only senior enough person that I even had a nodding&#13;
&#13;
acquaintance with which was Peter Cargill. I went to see him and asked whether there was&#13;
&#13;
anything that could be done about it, because this was a job that I did not wish to do. I&#13;
&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t think I threatened to resign at that stage, but I might well have done it, but it didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
come to that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               12&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 13&#13;
&#13;
       Peterâ&#128;&#153;s first reaction was to be very annoyed because he told me, and I do not know&#13;
&#13;
whether this was hype or for real, because he was becoming the Vice President for Asia,&#13;
&#13;
that he had asked for me to be the Division Chief for the Agriculture Sector in his region.&#13;
&#13;
This surprised me a bit because that would have been a very nice jump for me, but it&#13;
&#13;
would have been a considerable presumption. It was a job I would not have presumed to&#13;
&#13;
have been capable of doing, and it would probably have scared the hell out of me if Iâ&#128;&#153;d had&#13;
&#13;
actually got it, but Peter said that he had, in the discussions in the Bank, put my name&#13;
&#13;
forward and had been told that I was unavailable because there was an institutional job into&#13;
&#13;
which I had been slotted which was more important and that I was not available. He&#13;
&#13;
claimed that he had accepted that and had not pressed any further. But by the time I went&#13;
&#13;
to talk to him, another person had been chosen to be the Agriculture Division Chief in&#13;
&#13;
Asia, and therefore that job was no longer available. Nevertheless, Peter put out the word&#13;
&#13;
that I was to be found another more suitable position. However, most positions had been&#13;
&#13;
filled. I think the reason why my name had come up was because you may remember that&#13;
&#13;
just before 1972 Jim Evans had the intention of having an India coordinator within the&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture Department. There were so many substantive divisions and we had no country&#13;
&#13;
focus and we were doing so much in India that he felt that it would be useful to you, I&#13;
&#13;
think, you were even the Division Chief, that it would be useful to you to have one person&#13;
&#13;
in the Agriculture Department who could be a channel through which you could get your&#13;
&#13;
message through on a more cohesive basis rather than having to deal with eight, nine, ten&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             13&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 14&#13;
&#13;
substantive division chiefs all the time. So I presume thatâ&#128;&#153;s where the idea originated. And&#13;
&#13;
that would have been quite an interesting job, but the 1972 reorganization put paid to that.&#13;
&#13;
        In any case, when it became known I was available and that all agricultural division&#13;
&#13;
chief jobs had been filled, Willi Wapenhans said: "Well, there is one job thatâ&#128;&#153;s of a suitable&#13;
&#13;
level. I donâ&#128;&#153;t even know what it is yet. I know itâ&#128;&#153;s title, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t know what it will do.&#13;
&#13;
Itâ&#128;&#153;s called Program Coordinator and there is one in the EMENA region." Wapenhans was&#13;
&#13;
going to EMENA as the Regional Projects Director and was quite happy to see me in that&#13;
&#13;
job. He agreed to talk to Mr. Benjenk, who was the Vice President-nominate there, if I was&#13;
&#13;
interested in doing it.&#13;
&#13;
        It was obvious that the job would have a large budget element, but it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t quite&#13;
&#13;
clear what else. But compared to what I was scheduled to do - and at that stage, we still&#13;
&#13;
thought Sir John was going to be around, the idea of doing it later on would have been&#13;
&#13;
awful without Sir John around - I decided that I would prefer to take this job, unknown&#13;
&#13;
though it was, rather than lock myself away into something which I knew I would find&#13;
&#13;
very frustrating. So I went to talk with Benjenk, and he offered me the job.&#13;
&#13;
        Iâ&#128;&#153;d met Benjenk once before, but not under auspicious circumstances, as a YP,&#13;
&#13;
where I hadnâ&#128;&#153;t formed a very good opinion of him, to be honest. But this time it turned out&#13;
&#13;
to be much more auspicious. He told me that heâ&#128;&#153;d been following my career. Heâ&#128;&#153;d been on&#13;
&#13;
the YP selection groups, that was one of his many tasks, and he, of course heâ&#128;&#153;d been one of&#13;
&#13;
the principal architects of the need for change prior to 1972. He told me that he thought I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              14&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 15&#13;
&#13;
was a little noisy for him, and asked whether I thought I could behave differently because&#13;
&#13;
he didnâ&#128;&#153;t like upset and noise. I told him I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know whether I could be less noisy&#13;
&#13;
because I had never tried. But we came to an agreement, and I went to do that job. And&#13;
&#13;
very fascinating it was, as it turned out.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You stayed there for two years or so?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Two years.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     It was fascinating because it was totally new?&#13;
&#13;
A:     It was fascinating, first of all, to be in the regional management team at a time&#13;
&#13;
when the regions were being established. As you may recall, for the reorganization&#13;
&#13;
McKinsey had produced two pieces of paper. One was a description of the reasons for&#13;
&#13;
change, for organizational change, the other a design of the new organization with&#13;
&#13;
functions all set out for each of the units in the new organ gram, and there was the organ&#13;
&#13;
gram itself.&#13;
&#13;
       For reasons which I donâ&#128;&#153;t know totally, Mr. McNamara chose to publish the&#13;
&#13;
organogram, because he liked it. But he didnâ&#128;&#153;t like what the various bits were supposed to&#13;
&#13;
do, so that was never published. I presume some people saw it, but I never did. So what it&#13;
&#13;
meant was that we had the idea of regions, we had the idea of central services, of some&#13;
&#13;
coordination through central operations departments, but we did not know what they were&#13;
&#13;
supposed to do, because that rationale had been hidden from us.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             15&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 16&#13;
&#13;
         In the reorganization we had to allocate the staff. I remember working in the&#13;
&#13;
mornings with Willi Wapenhans principally in Agriculture, dividing up the agriculture&#13;
&#13;
staff between the central areas and the five regions, on as fair a basis as we could in terms&#13;
&#13;
of making certain the talents that were needed in particular regions went there. There was a&#13;
&#13;
fair division of the bright stars and the more pedestrian type of people and the skill mix&#13;
&#13;
was as best we could get. But in a climate in which we did not know what the functions of&#13;
&#13;
the central unit were going to be, it was very difficult to determine what kind of people you&#13;
&#13;
needed in the central department. So in the end we put into the central operations those&#13;
&#13;
division chiefs who were not considered to be flexible enough and wide-ranging enough to&#13;
&#13;
be the operational division chiefs for the sector in each region, and vice versa. So thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
how we allocated the people to central operations, which were not necessarily the best&#13;
&#13;
people. But we didnâ&#128;&#153;t know what the job was, so we just divided everybody up as best we&#13;
&#13;
could.&#13;
&#13;
         In the afternoons I would move with Willie to the EMENA Projects Department,&#13;
&#13;
and we would try and put together the teams for each sector. So in the mornings we were&#13;
&#13;
all Agriculture, spreading it out; in the afternoons we were all EMENA region, accepting&#13;
&#13;
staff not only from Agriculture but from everybody else and arguing about whether we had&#13;
&#13;
got a suitable number, suitable types, suitable skills, from everywhere to get a department&#13;
&#13;
going. It was much easier on the country side because the same country departments&#13;
&#13;
generally just amalgamated into the regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               16&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 17&#13;
&#13;
       The reason why it was fascinating was that the regional staffs had to devise for&#13;
&#13;
themselves what it was that they would do and how they would operate from scratch, with&#13;
&#13;
a blank sheet as to how the Bank was going to operate in the future. That was done by a&#13;
&#13;
team consisting of the Regional Vice President, the Program Coordinator for each of the&#13;
&#13;
five regions, Burke Knapp, and I think somebody from the central function, whether it was&#13;
&#13;
Warren Baum or somebody else. We would just go at it once the regions were formed, and&#13;
&#13;
produced the Blue Book which was, if you remember, the document that laid those things&#13;
&#13;
down from scratch.&#13;
&#13;
       So it was very interesting in the sense of (a) doing something from scratch, and (b)&#13;
&#13;
of working so closely with people who were much more senior to me, and finding out how&#13;
&#13;
what they thought and seeing the big arguments and discussions. One issue was, for&#13;
&#13;
example, how much independent responsibility the regions would have, and how much&#13;
&#13;
coordination there would be through, say, a central Loan Committee. This was one of the&#13;
&#13;
two issues on which McNamara had to join the group himself to sort it out. Some of the&#13;
&#13;
language used between various vice presidents at that time gave me a first inkling that&#13;
&#13;
people of such seniority had the same squabbles and arguments and rude language usage&#13;
&#13;
that prevailed at lower levels in the Bank. There was an argument, for example, between a&#13;
&#13;
Peter Cargill, who thought that vice presidents were grown-up people, and someone like&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Chaufournier who was the Vice President for West Africa, who could see a value in&#13;
&#13;
having a central loan committee. He was told by Peter Cargill in words unprintable that if&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            17&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 18&#13;
&#13;
he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t capable of running his vice presidency without a loan committee, he really didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
think he was fit to be a vice president. It was pretty vicious at that time. That was one issue&#13;
&#13;
on which McNamara himself had to join the group, because even Burke Knapp did not feel&#13;
&#13;
capable of stepping in and settling it; Bob McNamara had to come down and say that he&#13;
&#13;
wanted a central loan committee for quality control, and that was that.&#13;
&#13;
       The other issue of a similar nature was why on earth we had to have chief&#13;
&#13;
economists, and what they were for and what their involvement in operational matters&#13;
&#13;
should be. There were some who thought that they should take responsibility of what&#13;
&#13;
became known as basic economic reports. These reports were humongous and turned out&#13;
&#13;
to be phenomenally expensive and not worth the money spent on them. This type of&#13;
&#13;
reports were to be done every few years on the really important countries and some felt&#13;
&#13;
that the chief economist should be very heavily involved in those, in much more detail than&#13;
&#13;
just reviewing and advising. But then there were those who felt that the country economists&#13;
&#13;
concerned ought to be capable of just doing the job in the same way as any other piece of&#13;
&#13;
work. And that became another point on which Bob McNamara had to come down to say&#13;
&#13;
that he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t going to pay the high price for 27 Level, I think they were 27 Level, chief&#13;
&#13;
economists, if they were not going to earn their keep. The only way he could see them&#13;
&#13;
earning their keep was that they would take primary responsibility for one or two basic&#13;
&#13;
economic reports each year. So that was that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              18&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 19&#13;
&#13;
       Other than that, there were just a whole range of housekeeping issues. But the&#13;
&#13;
whole operating climate of the Bank was set by this group. It was a very intense period of&#13;
&#13;
work. I donâ&#128;&#153;t think I have worked as hard in the Bank, in terms of lengthy hours and just&#13;
&#13;
the relentless pressure for month after month after month for the whole period. Since&#13;
&#13;
August 1972, when the reorganization was announced, we moved into the new structure in&#13;
&#13;
mid-October, I think it was, without the Blue Book yet being in existence. I must have&#13;
&#13;
worked 15-hour days on an at least a six-day a week basis continuously from mid-August&#13;
&#13;
to mid-March the next year, I would think. I was totally exhausted, but it worked.&#13;
&#13;
       We were all very inspired and fired up, it seemed to me, at that time because, very&#13;
&#13;
unlike the 1987 reorganization, the 1972 reorganization was seen by most people, perhaps&#13;
&#13;
not by everybody, but seen by most people as being an essential step for growth. We had&#13;
&#13;
outgrown the old structure, and, although some worried about the diminution of quality&#13;
&#13;
control, the fact was that we could not continue to run the Bank of the size it had reached&#13;
&#13;
using the old cumbersome organizational structure. I think most people thought of the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization as being very positive. The organization was growing rapidly at the time,&#13;
&#13;
and yet this was still very much the beginning of the McNamara period. Heâ&#128;&#153;d been in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank what, three years already, but this was his first really major fingerprint on the whole&#13;
&#13;
organization, but it was all done in a very positive spirit to get upwards and onwards. Very&#13;
&#13;
different from what happened in 1987.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             19&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 20&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Did you have the feeling that your experience was pretty common throughout the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, that the other Program Coordinators played a role similar to yours during the&#13;
&#13;
aftermath of the reorganization or was your role different?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Others played very different roles, according to who they were. The program&#13;
&#13;
coordinators were very different types of people with very different background. We had&#13;
&#13;
people like Gordon Street, who was probably the most experienced person in terms of&#13;
&#13;
operations. Heâ&#128;&#153;d been a Division Chief on the country side. Iâ&#128;&#153;d been at least a Deputy&#13;
&#13;
Division Chief on the projects side, and was slated to become a Division chief. And then&#13;
&#13;
you got the Rick Barryâ&#128;&#153;s who were more the professional budget and organization type&#13;
&#13;
people. So the people were tremendously varied. Now, all of us took part in that jamboree I&#13;
&#13;
talked about, but different people had different levels of input and influence, and the like.&#13;
&#13;
Where it became very different was in the day-to-day operations of the regions, because as&#13;
&#13;
well as running the program, obviously one had to do the budget and that kind of thing,&#13;
&#13;
which was very simple in those days. We make the budget now unnecessarily&#13;
&#13;
complicated. But it was fairly simple then, and it didn't really take all that much time. The&#13;
&#13;
monitoring of activities and the budgeting of activities was not all that difficult and time-&#13;
&#13;
consuming.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I guess the principal preoccupation was the monitoring of the lending program?&#13;
&#13;
A:     That's right. Getting and compiling the project timetables and all that, which was&#13;
&#13;
very easy to do. One devised some techniques for getting a handle on the most important&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 21&#13;
&#13;
things which you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get out of the statistics, such as knowing which of your division&#13;
&#13;
chiefs and country directors you could believe. The main thing which was required every&#13;
&#13;
month or every quarter in reporting upstairs was the judgment of the Program Coordinator&#13;
&#13;
and the Regional Vice President as to what was likely to happen and a little less reliance on&#13;
&#13;
automatic timetabling, which I really didn't pay any attention to at all because I didn't&#13;
&#13;
believe the timetables. I used my judgment every month and talk with Benjenk about it,&#13;
&#13;
and that was that. The net result was that we generally hit our targets because we were&#13;
&#13;
constantly making certain that they were realistic and discounted in a proper way, based on&#13;
&#13;
our knowledge of the managers and the circumstances. I used to spend a fair amount of&#13;
&#13;
time making certain that I really understood what the problems were with each individual&#13;
&#13;
project, so that I could form a judgment from my own project experience. Likewise&#13;
&#13;
Benjenk could judge from the political side as to what was likely to actually happen. So we&#13;
&#13;
were always pretty on target. Yet, unfortunately we lost out in the big arguments during&#13;
&#13;
my two years as to how things were to be done from a Management-Information-Systems&#13;
&#13;
point of view. McNamara insisted on doing things in a particular way, which eliminated&#13;
&#13;
the judgment element, and I think we've suffered from that for the last 20 years. And we&#13;
&#13;
still suffer, because the only strength of a really good MIS system is the judgment of the&#13;
&#13;
people concerned, who should be held to their judgments. Instead there is a tendency to go&#13;
&#13;
down into the bowels of the Bank and getting micro information and then spending most of&#13;
&#13;
your time explaining away why a particular date doesn't mean anything at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              21&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 22&#13;
&#13;
Q:     This was the McNamara approach to management?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, it was the Bernie Bell approach, actually. It was Bernie Bell who did us a lot&#13;
&#13;
of harm in that respect. I spent a lot of time with Bernie Bell and had a good mission with&#13;
&#13;
him in Indonesia once, but he was a determinist in these matters and liked the program to&#13;
&#13;
reflect what was actually going to be delivered. Therefore, if you nominated 23 projects&#13;
&#13;
you were going to produce at the end of the year and concentrated on them, youâ&#128;&#153;d get 23&#13;
&#13;
projects and it would be exactly those projects. Whereas the more sensible of us said youâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
&#13;
better be working on about 35 projects, because things will get in the way and you will not&#13;
&#13;
be able to deliver 23 projects.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     How did he come to determine that issue?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Because he became the Regional Vice President for East Africa, and I think Rick&#13;
&#13;
Barry, who was his Program Coordinator, who was a professional budget person but didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
know anything about operations, put him up to it. Between the two of them they came up&#13;
&#13;
with this absolutely definitive way of looking at a program, where one had to define&#13;
&#13;
exactly what was the lending program, and everything else was subsidiary to this. We&#13;
&#13;
argued against it because we said if you do that, nobody will pay any attention to the stuff&#13;
&#13;
which isn't in the 23 projects, and so when you need them, because those 23 are not going&#13;
&#13;
to turn out to be right, they won't be there. And that's exactly what happened. So we&#13;
&#13;
refused to go along with that, and we had to doctor our reports so we had our 23 nominated&#13;
&#13;
projects and the ones on the side. Inside our region we simply lumped them together and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             22&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 23&#13;
&#13;
refused to allow that type of talk to go down to our staff, and so the net result was that we&#13;
&#13;
always produced our 23 projects every year, because one knew how to do that. Whereas&#13;
&#13;
East Africa did not. Despite the fact that we produced and the East Asiaâ&#128;&#153;s didnâ&#128;&#153;t, the East&#13;
&#13;
Africaâ&#128;&#153;s didnâ&#128;&#153;t, the system was not changed. Their failure to meet the targets was put down&#13;
&#13;
to the nature of IDA constraints and IDA allocations, and that our job was just so easy.&#13;
&#13;
And yet, anybody who worked in the EMENA region and the Middle East and North&#13;
&#13;
Africa knows that this wasnâ&#128;&#153;t true, and it was just a fundamental mistake, in my view, in&#13;
&#13;
the way numbers were sort of added up and relied on. But Bernie Bell had McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
ear, whereas Benjenk was always at odds with McNamara and John Adler, the chief of the&#13;
&#13;
budget at that time. They used to argue all the time, because Benjenk didnâ&#128;&#153;t have any time&#13;
&#13;
for all this crap.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Well, neither did Peter Cargill, I presume?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yeah, I think so, and Gordon Street, who was my ally in this battle, or I was his&#13;
&#13;
ally. We were both in that together, but we were overruled.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      But I'm surprised to hear that all this should have been the making of Bernie Bellâ&#128;&#153;s.&#13;
&#13;
Quite apart from Bernie Bell and what he influence he may have had in this matter, I'm a&#13;
&#13;
bit surprised to hear that Bernie Bell would have had very strong views on a matter which&#13;
&#13;
he would have dismissed as bureaucratic. He was not usually very interested in things of&#13;
&#13;
that nature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              23&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 24&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, maybe that was the trouble. He just took Rick Barryâ&#128;&#153;s viewpoint and&#13;
&#13;
presented it for him. That's quite possible.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     But wasn't there something deeper, something related to McNamara's belief that&#13;
&#13;
you had to go down to the area where the data are being produced and collect them and&#13;
&#13;
make them the basis for your decisions.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes. Oh, I'm sure, that's why he came down on Bernie's side, because it was his&#13;
&#13;
way of looking at planning. That's what we put it down to. Because the results showed that&#13;
&#13;
our system produced and their system did not. But, no, McNamara could never&#13;
&#13;
understand. We told him we would do 37 projects at the beginning of the year. Every&#13;
&#13;
quarter and in the middle of the year I would tell him whether our target was still on right&#13;
&#13;
up to the end. If we missed, I think we did 36 or 38 or something like that. Whereas the&#13;
&#13;
others would tell him 23 all along, and they'd end up with 10 or 12 or 15, and they&#13;
&#13;
wouldn't know that right till the end. If we did miss our target, you know, we never&#13;
&#13;
actually did, our system was such that we would have been able to tell him six months&#13;
&#13;
ahead that things were not going to go right, because our system was essentially a&#13;
&#13;
judgmental one. But it meant that McNamara had to accept that judgment. Benjenk would&#13;
&#13;
send him a piece of paper saying: "My projection is--this would be in March--that this&#13;
&#13;
year's outcome will still be 37 projects, plus or minus one or two, and that we'll be doing&#13;
&#13;
you $1 billion plus or minus such and such. Full stop." And that was it. No big forms.&#13;
&#13;
We used to send him the big forms but we used to leave it all blank and just put at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               24&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 25&#13;
&#13;
bottom what the figure was, because we could never have said anything about it that added&#13;
&#13;
up to this, because we were using judgmental factors. So we just sent these forms because&#13;
&#13;
we were required to, and we just left them blank. It used to drive John Adler up the wall. I&#13;
&#13;
think we still suffer from the application of sensible judgments in our planning.&#13;
&#13;
Q:         Although the system did eventually include more of an element of probability&#13;
&#13;
ratings.&#13;
&#13;
A:         Oh, we used those, but you donâ&#128;&#153;t believe those either.&#13;
&#13;
Q:         What kind of a person was Benjenk to work with?&#13;
&#13;
A:         Well, that was one of my nice surprises. I had had one contact with him before&#13;
&#13;
1972, way back, when I was still working as a YP, I donâ&#128;&#153;t think I had actually graduated. I&#13;
&#13;
had attended a meeting between Benjenk and Paul Goffin, who was then a division chief, I&#13;
&#13;
think, in charge of credit and was dealing with a North African project. When Paul and I&#13;
&#13;
returned to our office after the meeting, Paul Goffin said: "The first thing you have to&#13;
&#13;
realize when you are dealing with Mr. Benjenk is that when you get back to your office,&#13;
&#13;
you write a note very quickly and have it hand-delivered within the hour as to what your&#13;
&#13;
understanding of the meeting result was. Don't waste any time about who said what. Just&#13;
&#13;
get the bottom line down there, and get it in there quick, because, if not, you'll find in your&#13;
&#13;
in-tray the next morning a Telex to Morocco which you will recognize as having&#13;
&#13;
something to do with the discussion you had yesterday, but it won't be quite the way that&#13;
&#13;
you remembered it. But by then the Bank will be locked in because we will have informed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                25&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 26&#13;
&#13;
the government authorities of our position." That had been my only contact with him. So I&#13;
&#13;
was extremely nervous about the idea of working for him. And if it hadnâ&#128;&#153;t been for the&#13;
&#13;
lack of alternative options, I donâ&#128;&#153;t think I would have accepted the job. But I must say I&#13;
&#13;
came to admire the man enormously when I actually went to work for him. I think he was&#13;
&#13;
incredibly shrewd. But he had behaved in one way when he was a country director dealing&#13;
&#13;
with his countries and quite differently when dealing with the sector divisions. I know&#13;
&#13;
Willi Wapenhans, who had become his Projects Director, was equally concerned and&#13;
&#13;
wondered whether how long he would last in the job. Willi did not want to become a&#13;
&#13;
regional director, he wanted to become head of the Agriculture Department, the job that&#13;
&#13;
went to Monty Yudelman because he felt he was more adept at doing sector type work&#13;
&#13;
than running the production shop. He was very worried because he thought he would lose&#13;
&#13;
every argument with the country directors, who were Greg Votaw and Dieter Hartwich, I&#13;
&#13;
think. Greg and Dieter on the other hand, were all on Cloud Nine because now they&#13;
&#13;
thought their arguments with the projects people were over and they would just get what&#13;
&#13;
they wanted, and could do what they wanted, and wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have to worry about all the&#13;
&#13;
fussy stuff. I remember we used to sit in the management meetings. The management team&#13;
&#13;
was, of course, the chief economist, who was Attila Karaosmanoglu, Benjenk, the three&#13;
&#13;
directors Iâ&#128;&#153;ve talked about, and myself. That was quite interesting for a young person to be&#13;
&#13;
involved with. I can remember on the first couple of issues that came up to the regional&#13;
&#13;
management team, Benjenk sided on both occasions with Willi Wapenhans against the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             26&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 27&#13;
&#13;
country directors. Yet, these were cases where it would have seemed to me fairly open how&#13;
&#13;
to decide. They were cases where there were very good arguments on both sides. Yet,&#13;
&#13;
Benjenk came down very much on Willi Wapenhansâ&#128;&#153; side, on the projects side, to the&#13;
&#13;
absolute shock of Dieter and Greg. Benjenk told me afterwards, that he did that quite on&#13;
&#13;
purpose. He thought the arguments were so close that he could have gone either way, but&#13;
&#13;
he just simply wanted to establish that he was no longer a country operating type, he was&#13;
&#13;
now a Vice President of the Bank responsible for both project quality and country&#13;
&#13;
relations. He was damn well going to do that job in that way and he was not going to use&#13;
&#13;
his position to override Willi all the time, because he worked for him too. And he was&#13;
&#13;
going to run the shop so that things were done properly, and he thought he just wanted to&#13;
&#13;
have it very clearly established that that was the way things were going to be. Willi didn't&#13;
&#13;
win them all but he into any argument at least thinking that he had a fair chance and that he&#13;
&#13;
had somebody who was going to listen to his arguments and who will understand. He&#13;
&#13;
remained happy, as far as I know, the whole period that he was there. He allowed me to&#13;
&#13;
participate in the operational discussions which became the major part of my job, which&#13;
&#13;
was why it became very interesting for me. I think if my responsibility had been purely&#13;
&#13;
the budget and the program administration, once the first crunch was over I would have got&#13;
&#13;
very rapidly bored with that. But in fact I acted very much like a Senior Operations&#13;
&#13;
Adviser today, although that was not part of the job description. Gordon Street, I think, did&#13;
&#13;
the same kind of thing, whereas the Rick Barryâ&#128;&#153;s could not possibly play that role. Every&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             27&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 28&#13;
&#13;
yellow cover report that came up to us before they were issued to the loan committee had&#13;
&#13;
to be reviewed by me and that was that. If I had any problem with them I would raise my&#13;
&#13;
questions. Benjenk always backed me up. I must say he really did believe in that, he&#13;
&#13;
delegated and then he backed you up, not blindly, but generally speaking you could count&#13;
&#13;
on his support. So when I read a report, whether it was in the agriculture sector, which I&#13;
&#13;
knew something about, or the telecommunications sector, which I did not, I raised my&#13;
&#13;
questions, and unless I was satisfied, and until I was satisfied with the project, Benjenk&#13;
&#13;
would not even read it. He absolutely refused to read any green cover until I was satisfied&#13;
&#13;
with it. Then he would take it home and he would then come back and say whether it&#13;
&#13;
could go to the Loan Committee or not. Occasionally heâ&#128;&#153;d have some additional&#13;
&#13;
comments, but most times he would approve it that way. That was what made the job very&#13;
&#13;
interesting for me, because it broadened my experience outside the agriculture section very&#13;
&#13;
much, and brought me into the management team. Benjenk made me feel that the region,&#13;
&#13;
without me would have collapsed. It would not have existed. I knew that he did the same&#13;
&#13;
with Attila, who was his chief economist, whom he consulted on everything that had any&#13;
&#13;
broad economic context. Attila was also made to feel that without him the region would&#13;
&#13;
not exist. Willi Wapenhans, on the projects side, equally. And we all knew that each of us&#13;
&#13;
was the only central point around which the whole region really ran. Nevertheless, we all&#13;
&#13;
worked like dogs because we felt appreciated, while Benjenk used to go home at five&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              28&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 Eccles, 4/ 11195, Page 29&#13;
&#13;
o'clock every evening, because he really had nothing to do. He used his time very wisely,&#13;
&#13;
and it was a great pleasure to work for him.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 30&#13;
&#13;
Q:     So you left because Peter Cargill came and drafted you?&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Yeah. Right. Peter Cargill came and took me away, which, while it was annoying,&#13;
&#13;
it didnâ&#128;&#153;t cause me quite the same amount of upset as 1972 and 1987. But almost, because&#13;
&#13;
Peter came and demanded that I went off to do this loan portfolio analysis unit, for which I&#13;
&#13;
did not think that I was the most suitable person, not being an economist. This had mainly&#13;
&#13;
to do with creditworthiness and things like that. In any case, Benjenk had promised me that&#13;
&#13;
I could become the country division chief, it must have been, for Turkey, which is the job&#13;
&#13;
that he wanted me to do having refused to allow me to become one of Williâ&#128;&#153;s division&#13;
&#13;
chiefs. When he had a vacancy in projects Benjenk had said that projects division chiefs&#13;
&#13;
were relatively easy to get, and program coordinators of the kind he wanted were not, so he&#13;
&#13;
refused, and I accepted that. And then he said, I could become the country division chief&#13;
&#13;
for Turkey and things, which was something I would have liked because I hadnâ&#128;&#153;t done any&#13;
&#13;
work on the country side. That would have been the opportunity to round out my&#13;
&#13;
experience in the Bank. I kept a low profile in this matter, but Benjenk and Peter Cargill&#13;
&#13;
fought about it right up to the end. It was McNamara who told Bernard Chardenet, who&#13;
&#13;
was by then the Head of Administration, that he should listen to everybody and decide&#13;
&#13;
where it was in the interest of the Bank that I should go. He in the end decided that I&#13;
&#13;
should go with Peter Cargill. So I did and I sort of just went along, because I really liked&#13;
&#13;
Peter. The idea of working for Peter was attractive, even though I was happy where I was&#13;
&#13;
and I would have preferred to have been the Turkey division chief. So I went off to do that,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             30&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 31&#13;
&#13;
and it turned out, again, to be quite interesting but not something I would have done by&#13;
&#13;
choice, even with hindsight. It meant once again, moving back to the policy side.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     This, again, lasted for about two years, I suppose?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Nearly three, although I switched jobs in between within the department. The loan&#13;
&#13;
portfolio analysis lasted about 18 months to two years. Then I moved into Programming&#13;
&#13;
and Budgeting proper. The portfolio analysis unit was attached to P&amp;B for administrative&#13;
&#13;
purposes, but it was in fact independent and I reported directly to Peter Cargill on that. It&#13;
&#13;
was quite amusing in the sense that although we had done quite good creditworthiness&#13;
&#13;
analysis country by country, there was little overall analysis. I think some of our country&#13;
&#13;
analysis had been quite good. It had prevented us from getting ourselves into silly positions&#13;
&#13;
where we had large exposures to countries that were unlikely to pay us. So in that sense it&#13;
&#13;
worked effectively in the old system of individual country economic reports which senior&#13;
&#13;
management would look at and decide whether we could afford to go on lending to a&#13;
&#13;
country. But what we had never done was put all the risks in our portfolio together and&#13;
&#13;
added them up in some way which related to the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s financial ability to take risks. It&#13;
&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t mean to say that we would, if we found out that we had more risk than we could&#13;
&#13;
honor, that we would necessarily have cut back on our lending to particular countries, but&#13;
&#13;
the alternative would have been to improve the financial basis of the Bank by getting more&#13;
&#13;
capital or by doing something. Peter had the sense, and he was right, that we were just&#13;
&#13;
about at the brink where it was becoming difficult. As it turned out, it was a good&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              31&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 32&#13;
&#13;
judgmental call on his part, or whoeverâ&#128;&#153;s it was, I think it was his, he was Senior Vice&#13;
&#13;
President for Finance. I donâ&#128;&#153;t believe McNamara cared for this work very much, as youâ&#128;&#153;ll&#13;
&#13;
see. Peter just wanted to get this whole picture linked up. He felt that the Bank was too big&#13;
&#13;
and with decisions not being made now by one person who would keep this all in his head,&#13;
&#13;
he had the sense that perhaps we would end up with a lot more risk than we could handle.&#13;
&#13;
       So that was my, my basic job, and as I was, if anything, a financial analyst more&#13;
&#13;
than an economist, although I was not a financial analyst either, as we discussed right at&#13;
&#13;
the very beginning of this thing, I felt more comfortable in doing that side than I did on the&#13;
&#13;
economics of individual countries. So Chandra Hardy, who was the sort of second person&#13;
&#13;
on this, looked at the problem principally from the country side. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s basically the way&#13;
&#13;
we ran the shop, she would mastermind all the country reviews that we did, and we had a&#13;
&#13;
team of up to six people at one stage, some short-term, some long-term, who were assigned&#13;
&#13;
to us to do these economic reviews. I worked on a variety of other things, particularly how&#13;
&#13;
to make the linkage between what she found and the finances of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
       We accepted the country economic analysis and merely transformed it so that I&#13;
&#13;
could do the transfer the conclusions from economics to finance. Given the fact that we&#13;
&#13;
just didnâ&#128;&#153;t have time nor the knowledge to second-guess all the country economists, we had&#13;
&#13;
no other option. We just hadnâ&#128;&#153;t got the staff nor the time to go and do our own independent&#13;
&#13;
analysis of the Indian economy, for example. That was clearly out, much as one would&#13;
&#13;
like to do that. That was clearly not possible. So what we did instead is that we used the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              32&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 33&#13;
&#13;
two-gap model, to work out how much money you needed and then you looked at whether&#13;
&#13;
that was a reasonable amount that one could possibly borrow, or obtain from outside. If it&#13;
&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t, you started again. We used to take as given the parameters which connected the&#13;
&#13;
various parts of the economy, such as ICORs and all that sort of stuff. We wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t attempt&#13;
&#13;
to redo that, although in some cases where we thought some of the ICORS were way out of&#13;
&#13;
line we might really sort of quiz whether this was done to dress things up. So we werenâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
totally naive, but in the end, of course, we could not have the knowledge to really question&#13;
&#13;
these things if the economists stood up to our questioning. But what we found was that&#13;
&#13;
most economists taken outside the managerial structure would be very frank. We never&#13;
&#13;
talked through the management structure. We would always go and talk with the&#13;
&#13;
economists themselves, and we would have a free discussion because we were never going&#13;
&#13;
to publish our results country by country. So if we sat down with the India economists,&#13;
&#13;
they would tell us readily when we would challenge the ICOR, they would tell us if they&#13;
&#13;
thought that it was the wrong end of the spectrum for this kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
       But letâ&#128;&#153;s take an example where we had no problems of quality. We would be&#13;
&#13;
dealing with a first-class economist who was absolutely straight and produced the best type&#13;
&#13;
of model, a financial model that he could think of. What Chandra would spend her time on&#13;
&#13;
would be looking first of all would be the factors that could most easily drive that country&#13;
&#13;
into a balance of payments crisis of such a nature that it would probably be obliged to do&#13;
&#13;
some form of rescheduling. And then what we would do is we would ask the country&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             33&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 34&#13;
&#13;
economist in the typical methodology that he used in these things, to tell us what the&#13;
&#13;
probability was of that happening. And they would tell us what it was in their judgment.&#13;
&#13;
And youâ&#128;&#153;d quiz them and if some refused to tell us we would use standard assumptions.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Crops go up and the export price comes down?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yeah. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Something like that, or in the India case, the resurgence of&#13;
&#13;
droughts, where India would have to import grain rather than export it, although the export&#13;
&#13;
market wasnâ&#128;&#153;t all that much of a factor because it just sort of wasnâ&#128;&#153;t there all that much.&#13;
&#13;
Weâ&#128;&#153;d have to take huge percentages of changes in the industry to make very little&#13;
&#13;
difference in the figures because the external sector was so swamped by the domestic&#13;
&#13;
economy. Weâ&#128;&#153;d ask these questions and weâ&#128;&#153;d get some sort of answers. For some countries&#13;
&#13;
we found that it was almost impossible to generate a catastrophe without the most absurd&#13;
&#13;
things, and one wasnâ&#128;&#153;t prepared to go do anything absurd. If things didnâ&#128;&#153;t have at least a 20&#13;
&#13;
percent chance of happening, we rejected them because it was a waste of time to refine the&#13;
&#13;
analysis too much. That was where we came to our conclusion that thatâ&#128;&#153;s what the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
callable capital was for.&#13;
&#13;
       If we could see a risk that had a 20 to 25 percent chance of happening, we thought&#13;
&#13;
it would be important to defend the Bank against that, and so that we could take it if it&#13;
&#13;
happened. But if you are going to take the 1-in-100 type chance, no. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what your&#13;
&#13;
callable capital is for. If we started taking those into account, weâ&#128;&#153;d end up by not being&#13;
&#13;
able to lend anybody anything, except our basic capital itself. Thereâ&#128;&#153;d be no room for risk&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              34&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 35&#13;
&#13;
taking. That was a key decision we took that we would only look at events that could drive&#13;
&#13;
an economy into default. If the chances of that happening were only five percent or one&#13;
&#13;
percent, or something like that, then we would tend to reject it. Obviously, you could take&#13;
&#13;
any economy and drive it into problems with your assumptions.&#13;
&#13;
       And then the real risk depended on what happened. Some economies when they&#13;
&#13;
get into crisis find it almost impossible to get out of them without dramatic actions. In most&#13;
&#13;
cases of economic crisis thereâ&#128;&#153;ll be a breakthrough in two or three years and the country&#13;
&#13;
will get out of it again because things were not expected to persist. So this led us to&#13;
&#13;
dividing those countries where we thought there was a real chance of loss, where things&#13;
&#13;
could actually happen that we would end up by having to reschedule under concessional&#13;
&#13;
terms which meant loss, a financial loss for the Bank, and those countries where you could&#13;
&#13;
get into a cash flow problem, maybe they wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t pay you for two or three years, maybe&#13;
&#13;
even five years, but in the end theyâ&#128;&#153;d pay you back because they would be perfectly&#13;
&#13;
capable of doing so. We had to apply all kinds of judgmental factors about our preferred&#13;
&#13;
creditor status. We took a decision that the first thing that we would do would be to assume&#13;
&#13;
we didnâ&#128;&#153;t have preferred credit status. That was the only distinction from other creditors we&#13;
&#13;
had. What would we be doing if we were just like any other long-term creditor as opposed&#13;
&#13;
to short-term creditor. And we would work out the probabilities that a rescheduling to&#13;
&#13;
long-term creditors would have to take place. Then we would apply another judgmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              35&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 36&#13;
&#13;
factor as to, if that was the situation, what was the chance the Bank will survive and make&#13;
&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s long-term creditors accept this.&#13;
&#13;
       So we began to categorize countries in this respect, into those that seemed to&#13;
&#13;
present no risk at all, those that could present some sort of temporary liquidity risk, and&#13;
&#13;
those where we really could expect to end up with a loss. After that we derived a number&#13;
&#13;
of factors. One was that we had to have a better loan-loss ratio, and a loan loss reserve of&#13;
&#13;
about 10 percent of the portfolio. Such a figure had never been derived before because&#13;
&#13;
nobody had any basis on which to do so, our reserves were just our reserves. We didn't&#13;
&#13;
really know why they were there, except that they were all our profits, and we'd taken out a&#13;
&#13;
million or so a year for IDA, but nobody really knew whether that was right or wrong.&#13;
&#13;
Although I don't think our judgments in the past had been that far out. But now we&#13;
&#13;
stipulated a loan-loss ratio and then limited the growth of exposure in countries that were&#13;
&#13;
in the potential loss category. Our estimate of how much portfolio they had times the risk&#13;
&#13;
we thought they were going to produce a loss was such that they all kept below 10 percent.&#13;
&#13;
So first principal conclusion was that we thought we better have a 10 percent reserve ratio,&#13;
&#13;
and that was accepted by McNamara. Another side conclusion was that our portfolio in&#13;
&#13;
that category of potential loss making countries would be restricted. We never published&#13;
&#13;
that list of countries, of course; it would have been dynamite on the market so it was a very&#13;
&#13;
closely held secret. For a lot of the countries on that list this presented no problem. They&#13;
&#13;
were the countries that had been ex-IDA and would now become IDA countries again and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              36&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 37&#13;
&#13;
therefore their IBRD portfolio would slowly decline. We had lent Bank money, for&#13;
&#13;
example, to Tanzania, and weâ&#128;&#153;d lent to a number of other places where we really should&#13;
&#13;
never have lent Bank money in the first place. So now these countries became IDA only&#13;
&#13;
countries. There was nothing we could do about the portfolio as such, and there was no&#13;
&#13;
need for us to say anything about it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     The decision to lend Bank money to IDA countries like Tanzania was of course&#13;
&#13;
driven by McNamara, who was very concerned that you were lending to the poorest&#13;
&#13;
countries without the constraints imposed by the limitations of available IDA resources. So&#13;
&#13;
your conclusions in a way put a stop to those experiments?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Right. That's right. We didn't say, you canâ&#128;&#153;t lend. We were a little bit more&#13;
&#13;
sophisticated than that. What we did was to determine what proportion of each country's&#13;
&#13;
portfolio was at risk. If you took India, for example, which was in that group at that time,&#13;
&#13;
that was before they really were considered highly risky, we were only applying a factor of&#13;
&#13;
something like 25 percent of the portfolio was at risk in India. Or, if you wish, there was a&#13;
&#13;
25 percent risk that a loss would occur. For Zaire, in contrast, we thought it was 100&#13;
&#13;
percent of the portfolio which was at risk. Then we said, if at any one time your 10 percent&#13;
&#13;
reserve adds up to so much, you have to keep the share of your portfolio at risk within that&#13;
&#13;
number. You can lend more to India if you want to, but for every dollar you add to the&#13;
&#13;
portfolio you add 25 percent to the risk going, and you've got to keep the total risk within&#13;
&#13;
the 10 percent reserve. We were not going to get into the operational decision as to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             37&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 38&#13;
&#13;
whether you lent $4 to India or $1 to Zaire, but by giving 100 percent weighting to Zaire,&#13;
&#13;
nobody was likely to use this scarce 10 percent reserve to waste any more money on Zaire;&#13;
&#13;
one would rather lend $4 to India, or some other country in like situations. But we didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
actually say you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t lend to Zaire.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     So the net result of your exercise was that you had the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s portfolio of&#13;
&#13;
outstanding loans as projected into the future multiplied by some factor that reflected the&#13;
&#13;
relative risk for those countries in category three which could lead to some real losses?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Right, and to limit the risk to the 10 percent loss reserve. Now, then we got into&#13;
&#13;
category two, which was the risky countries but with remote probability of real loss. These&#13;
&#13;
were the Brazils and Mexicos where the chances of them ever actually not paying us was&#13;
&#13;
rather slim. The chances of them getting into a problem from time to time, however, was&#13;
&#13;
very high, at least it seemed to us very high. In those countries we did not worry about our&#13;
&#13;
reserves, because we did not expect to use our reserves because we did not anticipate&#13;
&#13;
losses. Here the concern was related to the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s income. What if Brazil fails to pay,&#13;
&#13;
would we still be able to report a positive net income? If any of these countries simply&#13;
&#13;
can't pay you, put a moratorium on their debt service and say: "We are not paying&#13;
&#13;
anybody. We are in just desperate state," what do we do then? So what we said was, we&#13;
&#13;
could have eight percent of our portfolio in Brazil, another eight percent in Mexico, and,&#13;
&#13;
say, four percent in Yugoslavia, all being in difficulty at the same time, a blend of large&#13;
&#13;
and medium-sized borrowers adding up to 20 percent of the portfolio. We decided, looking&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              38&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 39&#13;
&#13;
at the portfolio and the risk that a number of borrowers could be in difficulty at the same&#13;
&#13;
time, that this was the sort of level we ought to be protected against. So we wanted our&#13;
&#13;
interest coverage ratio to be at least 1:20, which means that our earnings were 1.2 times our&#13;
&#13;
outgoings in terms of interest. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s administrative costs were piffling, they didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
enter into the financial picture for the Bank at all. When you are dealing with billions of&#13;
&#13;
interest income and billions of interest payments, itâ&#128;&#153;s the difference between these two that&#13;
&#13;
matters. The fact that thereâ&#128;&#153;s $1 billion of administrative expenses is neither here nor there.&#13;
&#13;
It was the difference in the interest rates which mattered. So this became really a matter of&#13;
&#13;
fixing our interest rate and fixing the amount of free capital we had, so that the amount of&#13;
&#13;
income we got in from loans was 20 percent higher than the amount we actually needed to&#13;
&#13;
pay out in statutory service of our bonds. This is how we came to establish an interest&#13;
&#13;
coverage ratio of 1:20.&#13;
&#13;
       And then at the same time we said, we canâ&#128;&#153;t allow the Brazils and the Mexicos to&#13;
&#13;
exceed eight percent of the portfolio because the risks involved for our income would&#13;
&#13;
become too great. But the two are linked, the eight percent limitation only had meaning in&#13;
&#13;
the sense that we aimed at an interest coverage ratio of 1:20. If you decided to get more&#13;
&#13;
capital your interest coverage ratio went up to 1:30, and you wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t mind if your&#13;
&#13;
portfolio then expanded to 10 percent, or 12 percent, because you could take it. But if your&#13;
&#13;
interest coverage dropped, as it was then doing, it was dropping from 1:20 to 1:15, which&#13;
&#13;
worried me, then the price of this was that you had to spread your portfolio around a little&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              39&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 40&#13;
&#13;
bit more and that you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t afford to have Mexico and Brazil lumped at eight percent,&#13;
&#13;
or allow your Indonesia portfolio to grow. You have to keep your portfolio in these&#13;
&#13;
countries down to maintain your projected interest coverage ratio.&#13;
&#13;
       So we linked the rules covering the loss reserve and the interest coverage and then&#13;
&#13;
we added a number of other refinements, such as the exposure of our portfolio to things&#13;
&#13;
like coffee. The coffee price was by far the most threatening commodity price. If the coffee&#13;
&#13;
price dropped, it affected more countries than just about anything else. Copper prices, for&#13;
&#13;
example, didn't matter much because copper prices would cause chaos in Chile and chaos&#13;
&#13;
in Zambia, but nowhere else. But coffee, we had so many countries around that were&#13;
&#13;
heavily dependent on coffee, that a failure in the price of coffee could have 20 countries in&#13;
&#13;
real dire straits all at one time. This is just to demonstrate that things were not unlinked and&#13;
&#13;
that you needed to have a number of cross checks to make sure that your behaviour&#13;
&#13;
remained consistent with events in the global economy.&#13;
&#13;
       Peter Cargill was an easy sell, he understood what we were trying to do and agreed&#13;
&#13;
with our proposals. When he went up to McNamara it was really quite interesting. I only&#13;
&#13;
had a couple of real sessions with McNamara on this project, and the only people who&#13;
&#13;
were present were Peter Cargill and Burke Knapp, and me and McNamara to decide&#13;
&#13;
whether to accept my report. McNamara said that he had two problems with it. One was&#13;
&#13;
that he thought we were being too pessimistic on India, which nowadays turned out to be&#13;
&#13;
right, but in those days I don't think was wrong at all. So McNamara said: "I just don't&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              40&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 41&#13;
&#13;
believe that what you are doing is are valuing this dollar portfolio only at whatever it was."&#13;
&#13;
It was a very funny meeting because it was me and McNamara, and both Peter Cargill and&#13;
&#13;
Burke Knapp kept quiet on one side. Burke Knapp was asked to give his comments in the&#13;
&#13;
beginning and he said, he preferred to listen. So it was really McNamara and I. In the end I&#13;
&#13;
said to him: "Look, Bob, thereâ&#128;&#153;s only one way we can test this," I said, "Iâ&#128;&#153;ll go up to New&#13;
&#13;
York, or if you want to go, you go to New York, and you take a $10 million slab of Indian&#13;
&#13;
debt due in 10-yearsâ&#128;&#153; time, and weâ&#128;&#153;ll sell it to somebody, and weâ&#128;&#153;ll see how much we can&#13;
&#13;
get. According to my methodology, you will get stoned for it, while according to you,&#13;
&#13;
youâ&#128;&#153;ll get $10 million for it, because this was an investment really earning interest at a&#13;
&#13;
reasonable rate.â&#128;? And he looked at me at that stage and shrugged his shoulders and said:&#13;
&#13;
"You win." He said, "You win." So that was the end of that argument, and therefore the&#13;
&#13;
10 percent loss reserve, which he did not like, was accepted.&#13;
&#13;
       And the other point McNamara made was that my assumptions about the 1:20&#13;
&#13;
interest coverage ratio were just too stringent. Now we never published our report, but we&#13;
&#13;
were going to write this up into one of Joe Wood's reports. Joe Wood was at that time in&#13;
&#13;
P&amp;B. He wasn't involved in the loan portfolio analysis, but he was a division chief dealing&#13;
&#13;
with financial policy, and at that stage he was sort of working on a capital increase. He was&#13;
&#13;
writing papers about capital adequacy, and when my results came out the results were sort&#13;
&#13;
of embodied in his paper. It argued the case and in very broad terms without mentioning&#13;
&#13;
any countries and it also mentioned the needed interest coverage ratio of 1:20 and a 10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              41&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 42&#13;
&#13;
percent loss reserve. Then Peter Cargill went off to Iran for some urgent business. He had&#13;
&#13;
to go and try and fix something with Iran. And this paper was supposed to have been&#13;
&#13;
drafted and given to McNamara, while he was away. The plan was that when he came back&#13;
&#13;
there was going to be a discussion with McNamara and Peter Cargill over the draft before&#13;
&#13;
it was finalized. So Peter disappeared off to Iran, and we submitted our draft. Then&#13;
&#13;
McNamara called up Joe Wood almost at the minute Peter got onto the plane, and said:&#13;
&#13;
"Oh, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been thinking a bit more about this. Why do we have to wait so damn long to do&#13;
&#13;
this report? Why donâ&#128;&#153;t we finalize all this before I go on my trip to Nicaragua, which is a&#13;
&#13;
week on Sunday? So speed up the report, give it to me as soon as possible, and Iâ&#128;&#153;ll clear it&#13;
&#13;
and weâ&#128;&#153;ll get it out." And of course that meant the discussion with Peter Cargill would&#13;
&#13;
never take place. Iâ&#128;&#153;d worked with McNamara a bit by then and Iâ&#128;&#153;d begun to smell a rat here,&#13;
&#13;
and so I decided that I would check around with Joe a little bit as to what was going to be&#13;
&#13;
done there. Now he said he thought that McNamara actually wanted to lower my interest&#13;
&#13;
coverage figure of 1:20 in the draft and just put in 1:10. Same arguments but just&#13;
&#13;
something to say the net judgment is that we should have an interest ratio, coverage ratio&#13;
&#13;
of 1:10 rather than 1:20. I was scared stiff about this, so I sent a message to Peter Cargill. I&#13;
&#13;
found somebody going to Iran and I sent him a little note saying: "Peter, this is whatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
going to happen. I just do not know whatâ&#128;&#153;s going on here, but I smell a rat." And Peter&#13;
&#13;
Cargill curtailed his trip to Iran and flew back, and arrived in Washington a couple of days&#13;
&#13;
before McNamara went to Nicaragua. The draft was on McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s desk, had been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              42&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 43&#13;
&#13;
cleared by McNamara, and was ready to go to the print shop. Poor Peter came storming&#13;
&#13;
into the office, took one look at the 1:10 ratio, walked into McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s office and simply&#13;
&#13;
said: "You cannot do this. This is not right." And McNamara sort of said to him: "Too&#13;
&#13;
bad. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s my opinion. I accept all the arguments. I think like that. I just think the&#13;
&#13;
judgment is wrong. I think you are just being too conservative in your assumptions and&#13;
&#13;
that 1:10 is enough." So the paper actually went out to press with 1:10 in it.&#13;
&#13;
Peter called him in Nicaragua at least once during the weekend to ask him to reconsider&#13;
&#13;
and he would not agree. So the report said that the 10 percent was there for capital losses,&#13;
&#13;
but the interest coverage ratio was 1:10.&#13;
&#13;
        The reason was, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll give you the reason first, before I go on, the reason was very&#13;
&#13;
simple. If McNamara did not succeed in getting the capital increase that was being&#13;
&#13;
envisaged, the interest coverage ratio would inevitably drop to 1:10 if he went on lending.&#13;
&#13;
He intended to go on lending, and therefore he didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to be embarrassed if the capital&#13;
&#13;
increase was not accepted. He could survive without the capital increase as long as he was&#13;
&#13;
allowed to run the interest coverage ratio at 1:10. And he feared he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t going to get his&#13;
&#13;
capital increase. In the end, he got it, so it was all resolved.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      And the 1:20?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Actually the 1:20 ratio meant that we needed a capital increase so it was an&#13;
&#13;
argument in favor because weâ&#128;&#153;d already slipped down in our interest coverage. We were&#13;
&#13;
projecting a slip-down although we were still at 1:28 or 1:30. But the rate at which the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               43&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 44&#13;
&#13;
lending program was going up and there was no new capital to back it, the interest&#13;
&#13;
coverage ratio was coming down. It was going to dip below the 1:20 in a few years. So&#13;
&#13;
obviously youâ&#128;&#153;d have to curtail the lending program now because of the lag of&#13;
&#13;
disbursements. As financial analysts we thought that stipulating a low ratio was maybe&#13;
&#13;
good politics but it was a crappy thing if you were interested in the survival of the Bank. I&#13;
&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t know what Peter Cargill did, but I have a damned good suspicion because at the&#13;
&#13;
Board meeting where this paper was discussed about five or six major shareholder&#13;
&#13;
representatives, who as far as I know, until that meeting had never known what an interest&#13;
&#13;
coverage ratio was, never mind any judgment about whether it should be 1,000 or .002, let&#13;
&#13;
alone fine-tuning between 1:20 and 1:10, as they went through their various speeches, said:&#13;
&#13;
"Oh, and one thing that I was surprised about was that if you read the paragraphs about the&#13;
&#13;
interest coverage, they all seem to lead to the conclusion of a figure of something like&#13;
&#13;
1:20." Therefore they couldnâ&#128;&#153;t understand why the bottom line was a recommendation of&#13;
&#13;
1:10. My suspicion was, although I never directly tackled Peter on it because I thought it&#13;
&#13;
was best to leave things unsaid, that he had made the rounds and planted these questions&#13;
&#13;
because he couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get it in there. McNamara at the meeting said: "Iâ&#128;&#153;m glad you accept my&#13;
&#13;
10 percent reserve ratio." And he told them that he took the message that they thought that&#13;
&#13;
the interest coverage ratio was a little bit on the low side and that we should be aiming at&#13;
&#13;
something on the order of 1:20 and that this just means that itâ&#128;&#153;s more important that we get&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              44&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 45&#13;
&#13;
more money. In the end we did get a capital increase and it was no big sweat. But it was&#13;
&#13;
quite interesting to see how he handled these matters.&#13;
&#13;
And Peter Cargill did have one or two rows with McNamara about things like that. He kept&#13;
&#13;
them for serious subjects but they did have one or two really serious discussions about&#13;
&#13;
matters of financial policy.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      I always had a sense that Peter was really quite cynical about everything, but this&#13;
&#13;
would indicate that there were some concerns that he really felt very passionate about, and&#13;
&#13;
he was also prepared to fight for them.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Oh, yeah. Not every single thing. Most often he would simply say, thatâ&#128;&#153;s not the&#13;
&#13;
way I would have done it but go ahead and see what happens. But on serious matters he&#13;
&#13;
would simply put his foot down, and Bob McNamara used to recognize that, and that, in&#13;
&#13;
turn, made Peter also be very careful about when to put his foot down, because in most&#13;
&#13;
cases McNamara would give in to him if Peter felt that he really ought to. The episode I&#13;
&#13;
told you here was the only occasion that I know of where Peter actually failed to have&#13;
&#13;
things his way. But, of course, for McNamara there was much at stake with his ambitious&#13;
&#13;
lending program, if he couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get the capital increase.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Why would McNamara not articulate his reasons for sticking with the lower&#13;
&#13;
interest coverage ratio? Why did he not say, Peter, I understand your concern but Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got&#13;
&#13;
to do it differently for this reason?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              45&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/11/95, Page 46&#13;
&#13;
A:     Oh, he may have done it. He may or may not have done it, but Peter was&#13;
&#13;
sufficiently loyal to people and he would never tell us. I mean, if McNamara had told him&#13;
&#13;
that was the reason he wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t accept his advice, he wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t come to us and tell us,&#13;
&#13;
because, you know, these things get out. It wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t be, it wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t be good at all. Peter&#13;
&#13;
was not a blabbermouth in that sort of way. He could keep his mouth shut when he wanted&#13;
&#13;
to.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Well, letâ&#128;&#153;s leave it here then. Thank you very much, Stephen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             46&#13;

            Stephen D. Eccles held on April 5, 11, 18 and 25, 1995

        <abstracts>
            On April 5, 11, 18, and 25, 1995,
            Stephen D. Eccles was interviewed on behalf of the World
            Bank Group Archives oral history program by Jochen Kraske.
            During his tenure at the Bank from 1966 to 1994, Mr. Eccles
            worked in the following areas: as a young professional
            (1966-1967); in the agriculture projects department as a
            project officer (1967-1970), as assistant to the director
            (1971), and as deputy chief to the agro-industrial division;
            in the Europe, Middle East and North Africa (EMENA) region
            as program coordinator (1972-1974); in the program and
            budgeting department as financial advisor (1975-1976); in
            the eastern Africa region as chief of the East and South
            Africa agriculture division (1977-1982); in the western
            Africa region as assistant director for the projects
            department (1982-1987); in financial operations as deputy
            treasurer and director (1987-1990); and as vice president
            and controller (1990-1994). Although Mr. Eccles specialized
            in country economics, he knew a lot about project economic
            analysis. His transcript concerns his work on the loan
            portfolio review, an extensive review of an agriculture
            project in Tanzania, and the reorganization of the World
            Bank in 1987.
