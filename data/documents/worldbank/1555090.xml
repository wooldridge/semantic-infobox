MEASURING PROJECT IMPACT: MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
IN THE PIDER RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - MEXICO&#13;
The Mexican nationwide program for rural development - PIDER - one&#13;
of the largest of-its kind in the world, has developed a system for monitoring&#13;
its implementation and for ongoing evaluation of its impact. The strengths&#13;
and weaknesses of this system's experience are analyzed in this case study.&#13;
The methodology for the economic and sociological evaluation of&#13;
the impact of rural development programs is only now being developed. The&#13;
lessons which may be-derived from PIDER's experience refer to a broad range of&#13;
issues, including the type of relevant information which should be collected,&#13;
the definition of the investigation unit, the data generation tools, the&#13;
disaggregation of the data collection process, the aggregation of monitoring&#13;
data and evaluation findings, the feeding back of information to management,&#13;
as well as the organizational structures required for carrying out monitoring&#13;
and evaluation.&#13;
PIDER's concern for the sociology of rural development resulted,&#13;
inter alia, in significant efforts for eliciting grassroot community parti-&#13;
cipation in development planning. Systematic guidelines for promoting such&#13;
participation, as proposed by the Research Center for Rural Development&#13;
(CIDER) under the PIDER program, are presented in detail in the study.&#13;

ABSTRACT&#13;
PIDER, a large-scale rural development program in Mexico, started&#13;
in 1973 and currently covers more than 100 geographical microregions which&#13;
are among the poorest areas of the country. PIDER attempts to redistribute&#13;
income and productive capacity to poorer communities which have been bypassed&#13;
by other programs. Virtually all major Mexican agricultural-related govern-&#13;
ment agencies participate in PIDER's implementation.&#13;
PIDER has developed its own vast management information system,&#13;
with the capacity to: assist management in monitoring implementation, take&#13;
corrective action quickly when needed, and evaluate project impact on bene-&#13;
ficiaries. To strengthen PIDER's information-generation and analytic cap-&#13;
abilities a research center for rural development (CIDER) was established&#13;
with a multidisciplinary staff of researchers (economists, agriculturalists,&#13;
sociologists, anthropologists, etc.). The paper reviews the management&#13;
information system in PIDER and the organizational framework of CIDER.&#13;
Methodological and institution-building lessons are derived in the&#13;
paper from the operation of the PIDER monitoring system. While the reporting&#13;
and monitoring procedures in the initial implementation period were appro-&#13;
priate, as the number of work sites expanded and PIDER grew in complexity,&#13;
the monitoring system was not accordingly adjusted and enforced; hence, it&#13;
started to erode. Information bottlenecks occurred, resulting from a lack&#13;
of correlation between reporting on physical progress and financial expendi-&#13;
tures. Too, as various works advanced to the point of completion and handling&#13;
over to beneficiaries, no information requirements were incorporated to check&#13;
on the actual use of project outputs. To correct this breakdown in the&#13;
monitoring system, an overall monitoring inventory of all PIDER works was&#13;
completed. In addition, attempts are now being made to include feedback&#13;
from the expected beneficiaries in the regular monitoring system.&#13;
For impact evaluation of PIDER, primary responsibility has lain&#13;
with CIDER, which developed its own research tools and evaluation procedures.&#13;
In particular, emphasis has been given to an evaluation of PIDER's institution-&#13;
building effects. The paper reviews in hindsight the pitfalls and weaknesses&#13;
in the evaluation methodology employed. These include: (a) the lack of&#13;
operationalization of the evaluation hypotheses; (b) insufficient quantifi-&#13;
cation; (c) the need for a disaggregation of the impact analysis by project&#13;
components; (d) insufficient orientation to the poverty group and project&#13;
impact on benfeciaries' incomes and employment; (e) weak economic analysis;&#13;
and (f) improper consideration of some crucial sociological variables, like&#13;
the communities' capacity to absorb new investments.&#13;
A complete mid-term evaluation of PIDER was undertaken in 1978,&#13;
during which significant methodological improvements in data-gathering were&#13;
introduced. The objectives, design, methodology and implementation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vi -&#13;
mid-term review are presented in the paper, together with some of the main&#13;
findings on PIDER's impact to date. These findings point out the significant&#13;
impact of irrigation works on beneficiaries' incomes, the sociological and&#13;
organizational constraints on livestock development, the socio-economic&#13;
consequences of rural roads, and the lessons learned about beneficiaries&#13;
participation.&#13;
Further strengthening of PIDER's monitoring and evaluation system&#13;
is suggested along two main lines: (a) organizational improvements in PIDER's&#13;
monitoring mechanism and institutionalization of M &amp; E procedures within the&#13;
agencies participating in PIDER; (b) methodological refinements in CIDER's&#13;
data generation and analytic approach, including changes in CIDER's staffing&#13;
and resource deployment. The study recommends changing the focus of project&#13;
evaluation, so as to center the impact analysis on the fundamental unit in the&#13;
peasant sector -- the family household --, which would be examined not from&#13;
the conventional perspective of the "farm-enterprise," but as a family pro-&#13;
duction/consumption unit. The integration of the sociological, economic and&#13;
agrotechnical perspectives on the household unit is believed essential for&#13;
grasping the consequences of PIDER investments on farmers' agricultural strat-&#13;
egies and behavior.&#13;

MEASURING PROJECT IMPACT: MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
IN THE PIDER RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - MEXICO&#13;
I.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
PIDER (Programa de Inversiones para el Desarrollo Rural) is a&#13;
nationwide program of rural development in Mexico, and is probably the most&#13;
comprehensive rural development program currently assisted by the World Bank.&#13;
Among all the agricultural projects supported throughout the world by the&#13;
Bank, PIDER is the one which has integrated the largest number (15) of sec-&#13;
toral components into one single project.&#13;
PIDER is not merely an agency; it is a developmental program mobil-&#13;
izing enormous resources and implementing an innovative policy of integrated&#13;
rural development. It started in 1973, expanding gradually over a geographic&#13;
area containing approximately 5 million of Mexico's rural poor. Between&#13;
1973-1978, Mexico invested over $1 billion in PIDER and current investment is&#13;
annually running at US$350 million. Virtually all major Mexican agricultural-&#13;
related government agencies participate in PIDER's implementation.&#13;
During the early preparation stage of PIDER it was realized that the&#13;
scale and complexity of such a program would require a systematic monitoring&#13;
and evaluation effort to assess the results being achieved and to redirect, on&#13;
an ongoing basis, the development resources as needed. PIDER has developed&#13;
such a monitoring and evaluation system. As part of this system, a special&#13;
evaluation center was created by decision of the Ministry of the Presidency in&#13;
February 1975: CIDER (Centro de Investigaciones del Desarrollo Rural - The&#13;
Research Center for Rural Development). CIDER is responsible for studying all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Mexican rural development programs, but its principal emphasis is on PIDER.&#13;
The creation of CIDER and its subsequent development during the last four&#13;
years is one of the major institution-building achievements of the PIDER&#13;
program.&#13;
CIDER is possibly the largest of the few research entities in&#13;
existence anywhere in the world specifically created to carry out evaluation&#13;
and strategy studies of a nationwide Rural Development Program. Yet despite&#13;
its impressive record of accomplishments, CIDER's growth has not been free of&#13;
problems and constraints. Its history, therefore, may provide an informed&#13;
guide for those interested in learning about the organization of monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of rural development programs.&#13;
Throughout the world, monitoring and evaluation research on ongoing&#13;
rural development programs is not yet very advanced or refined. Developers,&#13;
governmental officials, evaluators and researchers alike are asking critical&#13;
questions about the methodology of evaluation, the organizational arrangements&#13;
it requires, and the type of information to be generated. PIDER's experience&#13;
with its overall monitoring and evaluation system provides many useful answers&#13;
to these questions.&#13;
This case study will present PIDER's experience with monitoring&#13;
and ongoing evaluation in a rather detailed way - not just listing its&#13;
accomplishments, but also highlighting the trials and errors, the ways and&#13;
means through which they have been achieved, thus pinpointing the know-how&#13;
lessons which might be extrapolated to other similar projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
II. PIDER STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
(a) Rural Poverty and the Contradictions of Mexican ARricultural Growth&#13;
The launching of PIDER developed as a response to a socially and econo-&#13;
mically contradictory situation: although Mexico has achieved, over the last&#13;
three decades, the highest sustained growth in agricultural production in&#13;
Latin America, rural poverty and rural unemployment increased as well in many&#13;
regions throughout the country.&#13;
Mexico's rural sector is a composite of striking differences. It&#13;
has a rural population of 24 million, repr'esenting almost 40% of the national&#13;
population and labor force, which is characterized by a high degree of socio-&#13;
economic differentiation. On the one hand, it includes large commercial farms&#13;
under the management of efficient and sophisticated capitalist entrepreneurs.&#13;
On the other hand, the bulk of the rural population is comprised of three&#13;
distinct social groups: 1.5 million ejidatarios (small farmers, members of&#13;
the ejido cooperative groups with joint ownership of land), 1.2 million pri-&#13;
vate farmers with generally small plots, and about 1.3 million landless&#13;
families. The number of landless agricultural workers is increasing rapidly,&#13;
a consequence of limited farm land in relation to an annual average rural&#13;
population growth of 2% (net of outmigration). Based on a poverty threshold&#13;
income level of US$350'per capita, some 1.5 million families in the agricul-&#13;
tural sector are classified as "poor". This represents 40% of the rural&#13;
population and 45% of the total poor in Mexico. 1/&#13;
1/   The definition and the extent of poverty vary depending on the method-&#13;
ology used for computing the threshold income levels. According to&#13;
another set of criteria, Mexico's rural poor represent 52% of the&#13;
country's poor and 62% of the rural population. But regardless of&#13;
the difference that arises depending on the criteria used, the rural&#13;
poor in Mexico undoubtedly represent a very sizeable portion of Mexico's&#13;
total population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
During the last few decades, the evolution of Mexico's agriculture&#13;
has been characterized simultaneously by the development of the entrepre-&#13;
neurial agricultural sector, through the modernization and expansion of pro-&#13;
duction, and by the stagnation and growing exclusion of the broad sector&#13;
which could be called the peasant or campesino economy.&#13;
This process of polarization was not a matter of two parallel or&#13;
separate development paths, but constituted a single process of unequal&#13;
development with opposite consequences for the two sectors. The capitalist&#13;
sector has expanded its share of Mexico's total agricultural production from&#13;
40% in 1950 to 60% in 1970. 1/ Its resources have been concentrated in the&#13;
irrigated areas, where land-use has been intensified with the introduction&#13;
of improved seed, high fertilizer applications, growing mechanization of field&#13;
tasks, and chemical control. Private-banking and state funds have flowed into&#13;
that sector of Mexico's agriculture, and governmental agricultural research&#13;
has contributed the technology to this sector.&#13;
This spectacular growth, renowned worldwide as part of the green&#13;
revolution, of which Mexico was one of the epicenters, gave agriculture a&#13;
long-lasting development boom during which it was not only able to meet the&#13;
actual domestic market demand for food and industrial raw materials, 1/ but&#13;
also to produce large surpluses for export which earned much of the foreign&#13;
exchange needed to finance the country's industrialization.&#13;
1/   CIDER, Sintesis del V Censo Agricola, Ganadero y Ejidal, (Summary of&#13;
Fifth Farming, Livestock and Ejido Census), 1976.&#13;
2/   The potential demand is much greater and can be determined by taking&#13;
into account the increase in consumption levels that would be required&#13;
to meet the minimum nutritional needs for the country's poverty groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Yet the majority of farmers was largely excluded from the benefits&#13;
of technological research, technical assistance, credit facilities, public&#13;
sector investment, etc., and therefore from the green revolution. Under the&#13;
severe population pressure in this sector, available per-capita acreage&#13;
shrank and labor productivity declined, resulting in heavier unemployment&#13;
and increased seasonal and permanent migration, inside and outside Mexico's&#13;
borders.&#13;
The agricultural boom came to an end in the mid-1960's. The annual&#13;
growth of production, which had been running at a sustained 5% and more for&#13;
two decades, 1/ barely kept pace with and then fell behind population growth,&#13;
and the resulting shortages had to be met through increasing food imports.&#13;
(b) New Policy Directions and the PIDER Projects&#13;
Some of the policies applied during the six years 1970-1976 were&#13;
designed to correct this imbalance.    The evolution of PIDER itself (origi-&#13;
nating largely as a public works-infrastructure program, but then reoriented&#13;
to a poverty focus) was part of this new policy, aimed at channeling long&#13;
denied resources toward the peasant areas.&#13;
World Bank financial assistance to PIDER is given through two proj-&#13;
ects. The first of these is the PIDER I Rural Development Project, which was&#13;
approved in 1975 and helps finance expenditures in 30 microregions for a total&#13;
project cost of US$295 million dollars (Bank loan US$110 million). Investments&#13;
in the PIDER I project are allocated to (a) directly productive investments&#13;
(about 66%) for farm development credits, livestock production, irrigation&#13;

(Diagnostic Study of Agricultural Production).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development, etc.; (b) productive support investments (about 22%) and&#13;
(c) social infrastructure (about 12%). The second PIDER rural development&#13;
project was approved by the Bank in 1977 and helps finance expenditures in&#13;
20 microregions (in addition to those 30 supported under PIDER I) for a total&#13;
project cost of US$255 million (Bank loan US$120 million). The PIDER II&#13;
project supports productive investments (70%), productive support investments&#13;
(20%) and social infrastructure, evaluation and training (about 10%). Addi-&#13;
tional funds provided by the Mexican Government and the Inter-American&#13;
Development Bank help finance expenditures in other microregions, raising the&#13;
total number of PIDER microregions to 100. A third PIDER rural development&#13;
project, with World Bank financial support, is currently being prepared.&#13;
More detailed information about PIDER I and PIDER II project investments and&#13;
objectives is provided in Annex I; the attached map indicates the location of&#13;
the project microregions.&#13;
The potential beneficiaries of PIDER are, preferentially, peasant&#13;
groups located in regions that possess productive resources but lack the&#13;
necessary infrastructure, services and social organization to launch or&#13;
speed up their development. Approximately 50% of Mexico's rural poor are&#13;
located in PIDER microregions. PIDER's primary objective is to provide&#13;
investments and services in selected rural areas, in order to:&#13;
(a) raise rural incomes and living standards by introducing&#13;
directly productive activities;&#13;
(b) increase levels of permanent and temporary employment;&#13;
(c) strengthen supporting infrastructure for productive&#13;
activities and to improve social infrastructure;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d) help bring about a more equitable distribution of the&#13;
social product through a better balance between development&#13;
of the towns and of the rural communities.&#13;
The basic unit for purposes of investment programming in these&#13;
selected poor areas is a defined microregion, comprising from two to seven&#13;
contiguous municipalities within one state. The average microregion con-&#13;
tains about 50,000 persons living in three municipalities. Within these&#13;
microregions, PIDER provides assistance only for selected rural communities,&#13;
namely for those which have more than 300 inhabitants, but less than 3,000.&#13;
An additional distinct objective of the PIDER program is institution-&#13;
building and strengthening, through attempting decentralization of planning&#13;
and investments, and creation of a national coordination machinery for rural&#13;
development.&#13;
PIDER's attempt to redistribute income and productive capacity&#13;
to poorer communities, which have been bypassed by other programs, involves&#13;
a direct channeling of investments to the microregions and an effort to&#13;
integrate the activities of federal agencies at the state and micro-region&#13;
level.&#13;
Financially and organizationally, this is a departure from the&#13;
usual situation in which each line department is independently funded and&#13;
operates according to its own assessment of priorities. PIDER's innovative&#13;
organizational approach stresses coordination of budgetary authority and&#13;
active planning and participation at the state and local level, where the&#13;
programs are designed and executed. Coordination is critical since 14 central&#13;
agencies are involved in carrying out the PIDER program. PIDER funds are&#13;
allocated to each agency only on the basis of the PIDER investment plans,&#13;

integrated at the microregional level. This decentralization also aims at&#13;
involving the beneficiaries in the planning process, and stimulates the&#13;
strengthening of the planning and decision-making process at state and village&#13;
levels. Given the novelty of this entire institutional approach and of the&#13;
planning and financing procedures, an intense monitoring and evaluation effort&#13;
appeared to be an essential requirement.&#13;
III. THE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM IN PIDER&#13;
By their very design, rural development projects raise difficult&#13;
questions for any impact evaluation exercise. They attempt to reach large&#13;
numbers of small farmers, quite often subsistence farmers, by investing&#13;
project resources over large areas. This significantly reduces per farm&#13;
expenditures, and allows only for developments proportionate with these&#13;
small investments. Consequently, measuring such incremental development&#13;
is difficult.&#13;
Moreover, concurrently with the project inputs, many other factors&#13;
strongly affect the project's target units, thus requiring evaluation to&#13;
disentangle effects of different causes. The nature of the project target&#13;
unit - the family household - is such that a mere economic evaluation will&#13;
not do: the sociological, cultural and behavioral variables ought to be&#13;
taken into account as well. Moreover, the monitoring and ongoing evaluation&#13;
processes have to provide answers not just for improving a given project,&#13;
but for decision-making strategy related to future investment policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
In addition, two other factors explain the complexity of setting&#13;
up a reliable management* information system in PIDER: (a) the project's&#13;
multisectoral approach involves an unusually large number of development&#13;
agencies which have to be coordinated and monitored; and (b) its wide geo-&#13;
graphic spread over 100 microregions in about 20 states (with hundreds of&#13;
small investment sites in each microregion).&#13;
Consequently, PIDER had to develop its own vast information genera-&#13;
tion system, with the capacity to assist management to supervise implemen-&#13;
tation, to take corrective action quickly when needed, and to react to un-&#13;
anticipated consequences.&#13;
As currently established, the management information system (HIS)&#13;
in PIDER receives data from four major sources:&#13;
(1) The agencies which participate in the program and are&#13;
responsible for implementation of various components;&#13;
they report to PIDER on their performance.&#13;
(2)  Special groups of PIDER staff at the state level, who&#13;
supervise both the works carried out by participating&#13;
agencies in the villages and the accuracy of the reports&#13;
and disbursements claims submitted by these agencies.&#13;
(3)  The central PIDER staff, who perform a field supervising&#13;
function over both participating agencies and the perfor-&#13;
mance of local PIDER staff, collecting selected but critical&#13;
information.&#13;
*    The institutional structure of PIDER organization and management, in&#13;
which the SPP (The Secretariat for Planning and Budgeting) has a coor-&#13;
dinating role over participating agencies, is explained in detail in&#13;
the Appraisal Report of the PIDER Rural Development Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(4) CIDER, which operates as a special data generation and&#13;
processing center, producing mainly evaluation information.&#13;
These four complementary data sources are interlinked in a system&#13;
which is designed to feed back information continuously both to PIDER federal&#13;
headquarters and to PIDER state levels. 1/&#13;
The information received through the MIS is basically post-investment&#13;
information. It is not a substitute, but rather a complement to the system&#13;
which supplies PIDER with the pre-investment information. While the monitoring-&#13;
cum-evaluation information on current and past project performance is certainly&#13;
used in making decisions regarding future investments, a distinct program 2/&#13;
was set up within PIDER to finance pre-investment studies for project prepara-&#13;
tion. The information collected for these preparation-cum-feasibility studies&#13;
is supposed, inter alia, to serve as a benchmark for later evaluation studies.&#13;
One should note that, within the MIS, there is a rather clear dis-&#13;
tinction made between monitoring information and evaluation information. The&#13;
main evaluation research unit (CIDER) is generally not used for typical moni-&#13;
toring functions, which are fulfilled by PIDER itself. Instead, CIDER oper-&#13;
ates as a powerful research unit geared toward carrying out evaluation, with a&#13;
1/   The decentralization of PIDER programming procedures applies to its&#13;
management information system as well. It is critically important that&#13;
appropriate information accrue not only to central headquarters but&#13;
also to PIDER state levels, in order to permit decision-making to be&#13;
decentralized.&#13;
2/   Guidelines for this program are provided in Lineamientos Generales para&#13;
la Formulacion de Estudios y Proyectos and contain instructions for the&#13;
preparation of pre-investment studies for various types of projects,&#13;
including local industries, tourism, artisan activities, the creation&#13;
of rainfed and irrigation districts, forestry, mining, and fisheries&#13;
projects. Each pre-investment study is to include a detailed analysis of&#13;
the prospective market, technical specifications, a study of alternative&#13;
organizational arrangements, as well as financial and economic analyses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
strong emphasis on the sociological, economic and institutional aspects of&#13;
PIDER's impact. Of course, there is in each evaluation exercise an implicit&#13;
monitoring element: in other words, the evaluation team always has to find&#13;
out what has happened on the physical and financial side of project progress,&#13;
and to report on that as well. However, no conventional monitoring per se is&#13;
undertaken by CIDER.&#13;
There is, however, an area in which CIDER has helped PIDER design&#13;
the monitoring procedures as well: namely, in identifying the information&#13;
requirements and design of the data collection sheets to be used for reporting&#13;
and monitoring. Methodologically, it is difficult to select the crucial&#13;
indicators for which information is to be requested through reporting, and&#13;
to refrain from asking what would be "nice to know", but not mandatory for&#13;
running the project. CIDER has attempted to stick to the principle of&#13;
"iminimum information", which is the only sound principle for determining the&#13;
amount of monitoring data to be collected on a regular basis.&#13;
IV. THE ORGANIZATIONAL FRAMEWORK OF CIDER&#13;
To complement PIDER's information-generation capability, CIDER was&#13;
established as a special research center, staffed with well-trained profes-&#13;
sionals capable of evaluating the quality and impact of project implementation&#13;
and of deriving appropriate development lessons. Although CIDER is basically&#13;
financed under the general PIDER program, it has institutional autonomy from&#13;
the PIDER management. Independence is considered a basic prerequisite for&#13;
objectivity in evaluation and for freedom in the selection of research topics.&#13;
The Director of CIDER (first director - Jaime Mariscal) reports directly to&#13;
the Ministry and to the CIDER Board, on which PIDER is also represented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
There is also a CIDER Advisory Council which focuses on methodology and&#13;
research design problems. In practical terms, cooperation has been maintained&#13;
most of the time between the CIDER and PIDER directors, in order to bring&#13;
CIDER close to the main implementation issues and difficulties confronted by&#13;
PIDER.&#13;
(a) Objectives&#13;
CIDER's terms of reference define its main objectives in evaluation&#13;
research as follows:&#13;
(1) To evaluate the actual benefits and consequences of rural&#13;
development programs for the peasant population.&#13;
(2) To analyze the differential impact of alternative development&#13;
strategies and their adjustment to existing regional conditions.&#13;
(3) To evaluate the effectiveness of alternative approaches to&#13;
investment programming and implementation.&#13;
(4) To identify the forms most acceptable to the campesinos for&#13;
direct participation in state-sponsored programs, in order&#13;
to maximize the number of beneficiaries of public investments.&#13;
(5) To design alternative evaluation methodologies (adjusted&#13;
to specific components of rural development).&#13;
(b) Organization&#13;
At the outset, CIDER internal organization consisted of four&#13;
sections: (a) the Section for Applied Research; (b) the Section for Basic&#13;
Research; (c) the Section for Investment Programming (planning) Research;&#13;
and (d) the Training Section. Out of these four sections, three were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
related to PIDER: the applied research section was supposed to concentrate&#13;
on immediate field evaluation studies on PIDER activities; the programming&#13;
section had the tasks of working out the methodology for planning PIDER&#13;
investments at the village community level, identifying the beneficiaries'&#13;
felt needs and sorting out priorities; the training section was conceived&#13;
to devise curricula for imparting to PIDER state and local staff a better&#13;
understanding of the socio-economic problems of Mexican agricultural develop-&#13;
ment, as well as for explaining the principles and procedures of PIDER,&#13;
micro-regional programming, the lessons of ongoing evaluation, etc.&#13;
Tasks of a rather different kind were assigned to the Section for&#13;
Basic Research: it was requested to undertake long-term studies, concerned&#13;
with the structural problems of Mexican agriculture, the class stratification&#13;
of the countryside, land reform, forms of peasant organization, rural-urban&#13;
relationships, etc. These studies are not related to a particular project&#13;
but are rather intended to illuminate the fundamental characteristics of&#13;
the Mexican rural society and economy and to support the preparation of the&#13;
country's long-term policies.&#13;
This organizational structure remained virtually unchanged in the&#13;
first three years of CIDER and provided the framework for a rather rapid staff&#13;
increase and continuous expansion of studies.&#13;
(c) Staffing&#13;
CIDER assembled from the beginning a multi-disciplinary research&#13;
staff: agronomists, economists, social scientists, communication and public&#13;
administration specialists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
By including sociologists and social anthropologists rather than&#13;
limiting itself to the narrow conventional combination of economists and&#13;
agriculturalists, CIDER took a firm step towards an integrated approach to&#13;
evaluation. The study of the sociological dimensions of the beneficiaries'&#13;
behavior, of the institutional arrangements, and of peasant organization was&#13;
regarded as indispensable for a correct understanding of PIDER's operations&#13;
and impact.&#13;
Researchers of different specialities thus staffed each one of&#13;
CIDER's sections, and were requested not to work on parallel topics, but in a&#13;
team pattern. Interdisciplinary teams were sent out to evaluate microregional&#13;
developments.&#13;
By January 1978, CIDER's professional staff increased to 47 researchers&#13;
with multidisciplinary skills, from only a handfull of professionals in 1975&#13;
and 26 researchers in June 1976 (see Table 1). Ten held doctoral degrees and&#13;
about 14 had master's degrees.&#13;

As CIDER expanded its activities, several shortcomings regarding&#13;
its staffing became more apparent:&#13;
-    First, the largely young staff did not have sufficient field&#13;
research experience with alternative methodologies, and&#13;
on-the-job training was not emphasized enough;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Second, CIDER did not include among its staff statisticians&#13;
and sample survey specialists. This resulted in insufficient&#13;
use of quantitative assessments in CIDER's evaluation research;&#13;
Third, CIDER did not develop a medium-trained staff of mobile&#13;
field interviewers (data collectors); this increased the burden&#13;
put on the higher qualified research staff, which had to&#13;
perform the time-consuming tasks of filling questionnaires&#13;
entirely by themselves.&#13;
(d) Internal CIDER Reorganization&#13;
By the beginning of 1978 a social anthropologist (Dr. Arturo Warman)&#13;
was appointed as Director of CIDER. A review of CIDER's past activities,&#13;
undertaken at that time with World Bank assistance, concluded that the internal&#13;
structure of CIDER should be reorganized and made more flexible. The compart-&#13;
mentalization of CIDER into four sections was felt to be too rigid and not&#13;
conducive enough towards a continuous working interaction of research staff&#13;
or towards an active flow of ideas and experience.&#13;
A restructuring process was started consisting of the gradual&#13;
replacement of the previous big sections by small topical working groups&#13;
which reunited researchers skilled in basic (theoretical) and applied&#13;
(operational) research. The working groups are now each responsible for&#13;
a specific research theme and, at its completion, members will rotate and&#13;
team up differently into other research groups. This reorganization is&#13;
expected, inter alia, to increase the effectiveness of evaluation work and&#13;
its analytical research, by bringing CIDER staff with primarily theoretical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
interests closer to the operational issues of importance to PIDER. It will&#13;
also help extract more general theoretical lessons on rural development from&#13;
the empirical findings of field studies and enable CIDER to feed forward to&#13;
PIDER management both evaluation assessments of ongoing activities and policy&#13;
advise for improving the future strategic evaluation.&#13;
For evaluation, the prompt feedback from CIDER to PIDER management&#13;
is a crucial link in the project information system. Experience has indicated,&#13;
however, that this feedback depends not only on the speedy processing and&#13;
analysis of primary data by CIDER, as conventional wisdom would tend to indi-&#13;
cate, but also on the receptivity of PIDER management. Feedback is a dialogue&#13;
and both partners have to be technically and psychologically attuned to each&#13;
other.&#13;
For instance, on the one hand, during a period of more than half&#13;
a year in 1977, a transitional Director of PIDER practically fenced off PIDER&#13;
central management from CIDER evaluation feedback. Lack of receptivity to&#13;
criticism of implementation performance temporarily broke off the relationship&#13;
between PIDER and CIDER, injuring the effectiveness of the entire management&#13;
information system. The appointment of a new director general of PIDER in the&#13;
fall of 1977 (Dr. Miguel Cuadra, former deputy director of CIDER) was conducive&#13;
to an improved working relationship. On the other hand, PIDER management felt&#13;
the need to link planning closer to evaluation directly within PIDER's own&#13;
institutional structure. Therefore, in 1977 it decided to set up an inhouse&#13;
planning and evauation office (which will be described later) within PIDER&#13;
headquarters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
(e) Budget&#13;
CIDER is financed partly out of the general PIDER program and, for&#13;
the balance, directly by the Secretariat for Programming and Budgeting (SPP) -&#13;
as indicated in Table 2.&#13;

*    The figures for FY79 are tentative.   In FY79, due to the expansion of&#13;
its research capabilities, CIDER will receive significant resources&#13;
from other agencies for research contracted with them.&#13;
The part PIDER plays in sustaining CIDER's budget is roughly two-&#13;
thirds, slightly decreasing in recent years. CIDER's management assumed the&#13;
obligation that at least 50% of CIDER's research resources are assigned to&#13;
investigations directly related to PIDER activities. PIDER's budgetary&#13;
support to CIDER, however, does not give PIDER automatic authority in setting&#13;
up the research priorities for CIDER. These are defined in close cooperation&#13;
by the management of both. While PIDER management generally formulates its&#13;
perceived needs in terms of evaluation information or methodological assistance&#13;
for monitoring, CIDER often takes the initiative in suggesting special studies&#13;
on PIDER microregions or components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
V.   MONITORING OF PIDER IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
(a) Reporting&#13;
Basically, the regular project reporting procedures within PIDER&#13;
consist of:&#13;
(i) Monthly reports from each agency to the PIDER state group&#13;
on physical progress and the corresponding expenditures;&#13;
(ii)  Continuous supervision by a group of 1-2 full time members&#13;
of the PIDER local staff in each micro-region. They have&#13;
to check the accuracy of the reports provided by the agencies,&#13;
regarding both physical advance and quality. No PIDER dis-&#13;
bursement should be made to these agencies unless the super-&#13;
visors are satisfied with the quantity and quality of the&#13;
executed work;&#13;
(iii)  A monthly report on the overall progress in each microregion&#13;
sent by PIDER state groups to PIDER central staff, where it&#13;
is aggregated in the national report.&#13;
While these reporting procedures describe the ideal pattern, in real&#13;
life there are repeated departures from this system or bottlenecks in its&#13;
operation. Reports from implementing agencies are often overdue and not&#13;
accurate enough. The traditional weaknesses of these agencies' own reporting&#13;
and accounting procedures have surfaced in their relationships with PIDER as&#13;
well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
(b) Monitoring&#13;
When the state-level PIDER technical groups were set up, they ini-&#13;
tially included one or more professionals as supervisors to monitor the imple-&#13;
mentation of PIDER's investment program. Their task was to spend one-half to&#13;
two-thirds of their time in the field to visit project works carried out by&#13;
each agency at least once a month. They had to monitor the physical progress&#13;
and report to the State Delegado (formerly the State Vocal Ejecutive) -- or&#13;
to his deputy, the Chief of Operations -- and resolve technical problems with&#13;
the agencies.&#13;
The numbers and quality of these supervisors varied considerably&#13;
from one state to another. For example, for a period only one architect&#13;
was employed to supervise the Zacapoaxtla, Puebla, microregion. As a result,&#13;
his role was limited to inspecting the works from an engineering point of&#13;
view. But in the Sur de Nuevo Leon, there were three supervisors, one of&#13;
whom was a sociologist. They have established an effective dialogue with&#13;
the communities and the agencies and have been directly involved in the&#13;
implementation of PIDER's goals.&#13;
On the basis of these reporting and monitoring activities, the State&#13;
Delegado (who is the highest ranking local PIDER staff, with a coordinating&#13;
function) was responsible to prepare monthly the following information on each&#13;
microregion:&#13;
(a) physical progress for each investment;&#13;
(b) financial progress for each investment;&#13;
(c) charts comparing actual physical and financial progress&#13;
with programmed progress by category of works;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(d) lists of all payments made during the month in chrono-&#13;
logical order and by program;&#13;
(e) summary by each participating agency of the active flow of&#13;
funds during the month compared with the monthly program; and&#13;
(f) the proposed transfers of funds.&#13;
The consolidated reporting information (incorporating the findings&#13;
of the state monitoring teams) was to be sent subsequently to PIDER central&#13;
staff. At the federal level, PIDER had initially organized a section to per-&#13;
form the monitoring function. This section consisted of some 20 professionals&#13;
who attend the monthly state coordinating committee meetings and made periodic&#13;
field visits, concentrating on physical progress.&#13;
Again, this was the original reporting and monitoring system, as&#13;
designed. But how did it work?&#13;
(c) Lessons of Monitoring&#13;
Both the strong and the weak sides of these monitoring procedures&#13;
appear clearer in hindsight.&#13;
During the initial implementation period of PIDER I, it seems that&#13;
by and large these reporting and monitoring procedures were appropriate. The&#13;
number of work sites was not so great then. The agencies and PIDER, still in&#13;
their "breaking in" period with the new program, were learning the procedures.&#13;
The reports concentrated on information regarding the physical progress and&#13;
the expenditures for each authorized investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
As time went on, however, and the number of PIDER work sites sub-&#13;
stantially expanded, the implementation of the reporting and monitoring pro-&#13;
cedures started to erode. It became obvious that the information system was&#13;
too time-consuming, and somehow cumbersome. Delays in reporting created&#13;
information gaps in following up, from the state or central levels, the&#13;
progress of various constructions. The gaps gradually accumulated into&#13;
grey areas about which nobody had precise knowledge. Either the state PIDER&#13;
staff had insufficient numbers to cover all the work sites, or they did not&#13;
pay sufficient attention to their own supervisory responsibilities.&#13;
PIDER central management did not react promptly enough to the&#13;
erosion of monitoring at the intermediary levels, which only aggravated the&#13;
irregularities and gaps in the information flow.&#13;
Two important substantive weaknesses also developed in the reporting/&#13;
monitoring process which compounded the information bottlenecks:&#13;
-    First, the reporting information regarding financial&#13;
expenditures and progress was not strictly correlated&#13;
with the information regarding the physical progress of&#13;
works; this facilitated cost overruns and loosened the&#13;
headquarters' control over worksite performance.&#13;
-    Second, although various works gradually advanced to&#13;
the point of completion and of handing over to bene-&#13;
ficiary communities, no information requirements were&#13;
incorporated into the monitoring indicators to check on&#13;
the actual use and creation of PIDER-financed outputs;&#13;
this procedural oversight deprived management of an&#13;
assessment of actual benefits and impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
These weaknesses caused a serious breakdown in the project monitor-&#13;
ing system and were a problem in PIDER for some time, despite repeated&#13;
requests by World Bank technical assistance missions to improve the system.&#13;
Only with the change in PIDER management in the second half of 1977 has more&#13;
attention to monitoring been given.&#13;
The new management gave priority to identifying incomplete or&#13;
inoperative productive investments, primarily irrigation, livestock, land&#13;
clearing and preparation works, where supplementary investments should have&#13;
made the original investments operational. This reorientation, however, was&#13;
not carried out systematically, in part because the annual investment program&#13;
had already been determined and authorized prior to the arrival of the new&#13;
management group, and also because actual implementation required the atten-&#13;
tion of most PIDER staff.&#13;
It should be emphasized, however, that the problem was not simply&#13;
inadequate control over investment expenditures, or that monies were being&#13;
misused in a corrupt fashion. PIDER supervision of expenditures was probably&#13;
far more rigorous than for any other Mexican program. The problem was that&#13;
the data existed only as passive accounting information instead being as part&#13;
of an operational control mechanism, covering the routine process from invest-&#13;
ments to use of outputs, that would provide information about the real, ulti-&#13;
mate operation and use of the investments by the beneficiaries, as needed by&#13;
the management. Consequently, the new PIDER leadership felt uncertain regard-&#13;
ing the degree of progress of certain investments and the extent to which&#13;
various investments were actually being used by beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
(d) The Monitoring Inventory&#13;
To correct this situation, the new PIDER management decided to&#13;
undertake an extraordinary monitoring exercise: a full inventory of all PIDER&#13;
works up to the beginning of 1978, to determine the precise physical, finan-&#13;
cial and operational status of each investment.&#13;
The inventory was to be undertaken primarily by the new Division&#13;
of Planning and Evaluation, created within PIDER headquarters in 1977. This&#13;
Division is responsible for improving the quality of microregion planning and&#13;
of the annual investment plans. It also undertakes special monitoring efforts,&#13;
when needed, and continual on-going evaluations of the program, considered to&#13;
be of direct operational significance. The explicit short-term responsibili-&#13;
ties of the Department are to: (i) make a detailed review of PIDER activities&#13;
to the present; (ii) develop revised (or re-revised) programming methodology&#13;
(jointly with CIDER), including revised microregion development programs; and&#13;
(iii) evaluate and re-program (reorganize) the internal PIDER structure to&#13;
remove various inefficiencies.&#13;
The first priority was the detailed inventory of the operational&#13;
status of all PIDER investments and was carried out from January to August&#13;
1978 as part of the Mexican/World Bank mid-term evaluation review of PIDER.&#13;
The inventory was designed, in cooperation with CIDER, as a full census&#13;
survey, and the recordings were made as a joint field effort by federal and&#13;
state PIDER staff. While monitoring the actual works, PIDER central manage-&#13;
ment intended at the same time to "monitor the monitors", i.e., to ascertain&#13;
the accuracy and timeliness of the reporting, accounting and monitoring work&#13;
performed by the local PIDER staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
The monitoring inventory generated information by investment item&#13;
at the village level that would allow: (i) a comparison of the programmed&#13;
and actual investment program and costs; (ii) the assessment of the opera-&#13;
tional status of the works and the specific reasons for their non-operation;&#13;
(iii) the benefits of each investment items, in terms of physical units and&#13;
number of beneficiary families; (iv) general degree of participation and&#13;
supportive services (extension and farmer organization) provided for each&#13;
item.&#13;
Probably the most critical question in the data collection form&#13;
utilized was the one regarding the current status of each project work&#13;
(evaluated either as in process, in operation, or completed but not operating).&#13;
It included also an open-ended question about the reasons for non-operation,&#13;
for which 24 possible answers were pre-coded (for instance, non-operating&#13;
because of: lack of maintenance; lack of technical assistance; lack of&#13;
community support; poor location; organizational problems; lack of comple-&#13;
mentary coordination with agencies expected to take over the newly built&#13;
investments). The PIDER monitoring inventory found that about 4,400 of the&#13;
5,400 (or 81%) separate works undertaken in the 1,540 target villages of the&#13;
30 PIDER microregions were complete and in operation by early 1978. The field&#13;
assessment of the physical status of the works also concluded that 10% of the&#13;
productive support and social infrastructure works and 35% of the productive&#13;
works were not yet in operation. The twenty-four different reasons for&#13;
non-use (or non-operation) of these investments can be aggregated into four&#13;
broad causal categories: (1) problems in coordination and complementary&#13;
investments (about 40%); (2) lack of technical assistance (30%); (3) lack of&#13;
beneficiary maintenance (15%), and (4) poor initial technical design (15%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
These findings indicated to PIDER management that PIDER needed to strengthen&#13;
its coordination role, emphasizing improved local-level programming and&#13;
continued efforts to reorient the way participating agencies interact with&#13;
beneficiaries at grass root level.&#13;
This effort to monitor the physical works and their actual use&#13;
by beneficiaries, to the extent discussed above, was an important precedent&#13;
in Mexico. It represents one of the very few comprehensive efforts to monitor&#13;
public investment activity in the rural sector and it also provided PIDER with&#13;
the opportunity to "educate" the executing agencies about the need to tighten&#13;
their own monitoring.&#13;
Because of the urgency to undertake this inventory, however, PIDER&#13;
followed a very centralized procedure in its implementation. PIDER federal&#13;
staff undertook the actual field work, using state level staff only for&#13;
support, and consequently ran into time and staff constraints. Yet, it was&#13;
indeed also necessary to ensure that the inventory would not be subject to&#13;
the bias of local staff, who might tend to overstate the achievements or to&#13;
make such an inventory consistent with its own previous reports rather than&#13;
to let inconsistencies and discrepancies appear. In the Sur de Nuevo Leon,&#13;
for example, the pre-existing records reported twenty-four (24) livestock units&#13;
financed by PIDER as already functioning, while the inventory carried out&#13;
by central staff found that only one unit was operating. On the other hand,&#13;
the inventory provided a way to confirm information from the grass roots,&#13;
which may not have been considered trustworthy otherwise by the national&#13;
headquarters.&#13;
Under ideal circumstances, such a full inventory would not be&#13;
carried out. It was used in this project as a one-shot operation "to get&#13;
the house in order" by checking previous information, filling in the gaps,&#13;
and bringing the records up to date in order to suggest how specific steps&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
were needed in each state and microregion to speed up the completion of&#13;
unfinished works and to immediately increase the actual effectiveness and use&#13;
by beneficiaries of completed investments. It also temporarily filled the&#13;
void created by the absence of a dependable auditing system in PIDER.&#13;
The inventory was, however, an unusual, cumbersome and highly time-&#13;
consuming monitoring operation, which cannot and should not be repeated on&#13;
a periodic basis. The need for such an exercise will be obviated if the&#13;
lessons of previous monitoring efforts are properly learned by PIDER, periodic&#13;
auditing procedures are introduced and enforced, and an improved monitoring&#13;
system develops.&#13;
The main lesson of the reporting and monitoring experience thus far&#13;
has been that the timeliness and quality of field checking on various agencies&#13;
by PIDER local staff is the key to success. Given the immense number of in-&#13;
vestment sites in all microregions, and the wide range of non-standard works&#13;
to be performed by countless local contractors, it is only the field staff&#13;
of PIDER, in cooperation with project beneficiaries, who are in a position to&#13;
make certain that agency reporting is in line with actual accomplishments and&#13;
with initial project planning.&#13;
In addition, monitoring must be re-designed to include feedback from&#13;
the expected beneficiaries, i.e., the farmers themselves. The local communi-&#13;
ties should be better informed, through regular communication mechanisms,&#13;
about the content, objectives and deadlines of the investment programs affect-&#13;
ing these communities. The knowledge on what (and when) they should expect&#13;
from the various local projects and from the contractors in charge with execut-&#13;
ing them, would enable the target groups to feed back to PIDER staff their own&#13;
monitoring signals on the progress and adequacy of these works. More planning&#13;
information to the peasants would produce more involvement and better monitor-&#13;
ing of project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Another clear lesson is that decentralization of the monitoring&#13;
process, although essential, can work only if accompanied with tenacious&#13;
enforcement of the reporting and monitoring requirements by PIDER headquarters.&#13;
Without strong enforcement, erosion of the monitoring system would inevitably&#13;
occur, generating information gaps again. This is the best assurance that&#13;
information will rapidly move up the chain of command and that prompt correc-&#13;
tive action to rectify delays or shortfalls is taken. At the same time,&#13;
reporting and monitoring data requirements should not be regarded as invari-&#13;
able throughout the project's entire life. With each new implementation&#13;
stage, the information requirements should be reassessed and indicators about&#13;
the new stage introduced (for instance, data on use of investments, infor-&#13;
mation on primary or secondary benefits, on unanticipated consequences of&#13;
project inputs and outputs, etc.). Other indicators, which become outdated&#13;
with the project's advance, should be dropped and only essential, minimal&#13;
information should flow to management. Strong enforcement of monitoring&#13;
rules, together with continuous reassessment of data needs, would maintain&#13;
the effectiveness and sharpness of monitoring as a management tool.&#13;
Last but not least, the local PIDER staff should perform its moni-&#13;
toring duties over other cooperating agencies not just as simple technical&#13;
supervisors, but as genuine development agents. This means primarily that,&#13;
in addition to paying attention to physical and financial progress, the&#13;
emphasis should be shifted towards monitoring whether the completed invest-&#13;
ments can be put to use by their expected beneficiaries.    This would encour-&#13;
age the involvement of the rural community and especially by the program's&#13;
intended beneficiaries into the monitoring and evaluation process. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
would also enable the monitoring staff to send prompt signals up the chain&#13;
of command, about causes for the malfunctioning or inoperativeness of some&#13;
PIDER-completed works, as made by the beneficiaries themselves.&#13;
VI. METHODOLOGY OF IMPACT EVALUATION&#13;
While monitoring has been carried out primarily by PIDER itself,&#13;
the responsibility for impact evaluation has rested mainly with CIDER. In&#13;
performing this task, CIDER started virtually from zero, but has gradually&#13;
constructed its own research tools and methodology, tested them, and learned&#13;
from its own methodological errors. Further, CIDER has learned how to feed&#13;
findings back into the operational program, prepare specific recommendations&#13;
on the basis of its findings and then start the entire cycle over again in&#13;
the continuous process of PIDER evaluation.&#13;
T'he steps through which CIDER has gone provide a set of instructive&#13;
experiences for any project evaluation unit facing similar tasks. By and&#13;
large, CIDER passed through what we could call a "first phase" from its&#13;
creation in 1975 until the end of 1977. At the beginning of 1978 CIDER&#13;
entered a "second phase", essentially in connection with the start of the&#13;
full scale mid-term evaluation review of PIDER. In this second phase, CIDER&#13;
introduced significant changes in its evaluation approach, as well as in its&#13;
internal organization.&#13;
We will follow the development of both phases in turn.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
(a) The Unit of Evaluation Analysis&#13;
The first months of CIDER's existence were basically devoted to&#13;
constructing its own research tools and procedures. A geographic unit, the&#13;
microregion, which was also the investment planning unit, was then considered&#13;
to be the most appropriate unit of investigation for impact analysis. This&#13;
crucial methodological decision set the course for CIDER's initial comprehen-&#13;
sive approach in identifying and measuring the effects or impacts of PIDER on&#13;
territorial units, rather than sector by sector, or at the level of the pro-&#13;
duction entity, namely the family farm (later, as will be indicated, the&#13;
definition of the unit of analytical interest was changed).&#13;
In April 1975, the first ongoing evaluation was carried out in the&#13;
Baja California Sur microregion on a rather experimental basis. During the&#13;
second half of 1975, the research instruments derived from this first exer-&#13;
cise were applied in three evaluation studies carried out simultaneously&#13;
in the microregions Rio Sonora (Sonora State), Dolores Hidalgo (Guanajuato)&#13;
and Sur de Yucatan (Yucatan). Specific questionnaires were developed to&#13;
generate information on planning, operation and consequences through the&#13;
interviewing of actual personnel at all levels of involvement.&#13;
(b) Research Tools&#13;
After four microregion evaluation studies were completed, and cri-&#13;
tically appraised, two methodologies developed. The first, termed the "rapid,"&#13;
operationally-oriented methodology, was designed not only to survey planning,&#13;
execution, and palpable results, but to facilitate introducing changes in the&#13;
ongoing program. The second, "slower" evaluation methodology, was prepared to&#13;
yield a better understanding of the relations of production and structures of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
power at the community level, in order to deepen the recognition of local&#13;
impact and the foreseeable program effects in local communities. Basically,&#13;
these methodologies contained the following research tools:&#13;
(i) Procedures for selection and analyzing of relevant census&#13;
data;&#13;
(ii)  Framework for minimal data collection for investment&#13;
programming;&#13;
(iii)  Guide for interviewing PIDER staff at the state level;&#13;
(iv)  Guide for interviewing the leaders and staff of agencies&#13;
participating in the PIDER program;&#13;
(v) Guide for interviewing the municipal authorities;&#13;
(vi)  Questionnaire for members of peasant communities;&#13;
(vii)  Questionnaire for individual beneficiaries of the PIDER&#13;
programs;&#13;
(viii)  Questionnaire for the collective ejidos;&#13;
(ix)  Guide for the processing of statistical information;&#13;
(x)  Guide for sample selection in surveyed communities.&#13;
The first methodology was applied during January 1976 in&#13;
Zacapoaxtla, Puebla and later in Sur de Nayarit. Subsequently, a more&#13;
refined methodology was derived from both, to be applied on a larger scale.&#13;
With this new standard methodology, several other microregion evaluation&#13;
studies were carried out during 1976 and 1977.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
(c) Multidisciplinary Teams&#13;
The evaluation pattern developed by CIDER initially was to set up&#13;
a multidisciplinary team which was to carry out field investigations for 6-7&#13;
weeks and then write its report. For instance, in the Zacapoaxtla micro-&#13;
region CIDER sent out a team of eight researchers (an agronomist, a socio-&#13;
logist, an anthropologist, two agricultural economists, two public adminis-&#13;
tration specialists, and one economist), who worked for six weeks. CIDER's&#13;
special emphasis on the sociological/anthropological variables of project&#13;
implementation and impact was prompted by the desire to understand existing&#13;
social stratification in the intervention areas and farmers' differential&#13;
behavior and response to the project inputs.&#13;
Beyond their function as methodological tests and trials, the first&#13;
set of microregional evaluation studies produced operationally useful find-&#13;
ings, even though the short time span since the beginning of the program did&#13;
not allow for the assessment of the full long-term socio-economic impact.&#13;
Some of the principal findings of the early microregional evaluation&#13;
studies pointed out two limitations of the investment procedures, which reduced&#13;
their expected impact. They indicated for instance, that:&#13;
(i) Instead of being concentrated to form a more coherent&#13;
local development program, investments were scattered,&#13;
aiming at providing something for everyone, which reduced&#13;
their impact.&#13;
(ii) Directly productive investments (e.g., irrigation, livestock)&#13;
tended often to benefit the better-off farmers within the&#13;
villages and ejidos, exacerbating the unequal intra-village&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
distribution of income; productive support (e.g.,&#13;
extension, electricity, etc.) and social (e.g. health,&#13;
water, schools) investments, on the other hand, tended to&#13;
have more equal income distribution effects.&#13;
The ongoing evaluation studies also completed and/or corrected&#13;
certain information received by the PIDER management through the regular&#13;
reporting system. For instance, though Baja California had been previously&#13;
considered one of the successful PIDER microregions, the ongoing evaluation&#13;
study proved unexpectedly that, in fact, the state of project implementation&#13;
was rather poor. The CIDER evaluation report prompted drastic changes in the&#13;
appointed management staff of the PIDER microregion.&#13;
Various deficiencies have also been detected by CIDER evaluations&#13;
in the planning and operating of the PIDER programs. In most cases, the&#13;
causes of such deficiencies were traced to weaknesses of the original village&#13;
diagnosis and/or the original investment programming. Such deficiencies&#13;
identified by CIDER studies were:&#13;
(i) imprecision in goal definition of microregion plans;&#13;
(ii)  absence of a rigorous justification for the types and&#13;
orientations of various investments granted;&#13;
(iii)  lack of appropriate knowledge among peasants of PIDER&#13;
and its purposes;&#13;
(iv)  limited participation of the peasants in defining com-&#13;
munity needs and in the formulation of the local PIDER&#13;
program;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
(v) superficiality of the feasibility studies for the invest-&#13;
ment projects implemented by certain agencies with PIDER&#13;
money, and PIDER's failure to check their reliability.&#13;
The evaluation studies thus pointed to certain structural deficien-&#13;
cies of the microregion programs and not merely to some physical delays in&#13;
the implementation schedule. It was decided that CIDER should continue these&#13;
types of studies with the expectation that institutional and administrative&#13;
obstacles, which usually develop during implementation, would be more detect-&#13;
able in an early stage.&#13;
(d) Evaluation of Institution Building Effects&#13;
Due in large part to CIDER's sociological concerns, at least two&#13;
innovative focal points have emerged in the efforts to evaluate the non-&#13;
economic impact of the PIDER program. CIDER paid attention to sociological&#13;
aspects which, in other places, are often considered too elusive to be cap-&#13;
tured through evaluation, although they have an enormous importance. This&#13;
guided the ongoing evaluation efforts towards examining the structural factors&#13;
critical to self-sustained growth of the local communities.&#13;
The two sets of social consequences, anticipated in PIDER's design,&#13;
on which CIDER research focused were:&#13;
(i) Evaluation of the effectiveness of institution-building&#13;
under the PIDER organizational and investment strategy.&#13;
(ii) Evaluation of the degree of people's participation in&#13;
the identification, selection and planning of rural&#13;
investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
The institution-building consequence of PIDER's innovative approach&#13;
in delivering investments for rural areas is decentralization and integration&#13;
of discrete local investments into a common action program. In the Noreste&#13;
de Guanajuato microregion, for instance, there are approximately 12 federal&#13;
agencies and 8 state agencies, which participate in the programming of the&#13;
PIDER investments; similar institutional cooperation was expected to occur in&#13;
other microregions. This implied a strong change in Mexican administrative&#13;
procedures, in institutional arrangements, and in the behavior patterns of&#13;
numerous staffs.&#13;
The following aspects of local agency effectiveness were consequently&#13;
examined:&#13;
-    the cognizance level of development problems in the&#13;
microregions;&#13;
-    the patterns of communication between the agencies and&#13;
the rural population;&#13;
-    the criteria of agency decision-making and selection&#13;
between the various alternatives for investments;&#13;
-    the programming procedures and the patterns of cooperation&#13;
(or lack of cooperation) between various government agencies.&#13;
Thus, the evaluation effort consisted of testing the validity of&#13;
the PIDER assumption that decentralized investments can be promoted in Mexico&#13;
with a high degree of effectiveness, provided a new style of public adminis-&#13;
tration is created. Unanticipated (or anticipated) institutional and behav-&#13;
ioral obstacles to the new approach are examined as they appear during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
(e) The Methodology for Community Participation&#13;
The concern for evaluating the institution-building impact of PIDER&#13;
is well matched by CIDER's focus on the necessary complement to institution-&#13;
building: grass root participation in rural development programs. "Partici-&#13;
pation" is a key concept in the Mexican political arena. It was realized that&#13;
without a sociological in-depth analysis of community power mechanisms and of&#13;
whatever positive planning experience has been accumulated, genuine grass root&#13;
participation in investment decision-making would never be achieved. Since&#13;
traditional programs have been the hybrid product of bureaucratic or paternal-&#13;
istic assessment of needs and of a political process of demand-making and&#13;
pressuring, the basic issue was to involve the campesinos effectively in the&#13;
assessment of village needs and priorities for the investment program.&#13;
On the other side, it soon became obvious that the over-ambitious&#13;
objectives initially set-up for ensuring grass root participation in PIDER&#13;
were difficult to reach. The deadlines for achieving them were premature.&#13;
Initial reports on the degree of genuine participation in planning brought&#13;
the message that the expectations formulated at appraisal stage were more&#13;
wishful thinking rather than realistic estimates. So far, actual participa-&#13;
tion has been inadequate.&#13;
A methodological innovation in evaluating participatory mechanisms&#13;
was the launching of a sociological controlled experiment. It was started in&#13;
two PIDER-supported villages, and it was aimed at producing an optimal model&#13;
of peasants' involvement in planning for rural development. The two villages&#13;
(one ejido community and a non-ejido village), in Amealco microregion, were&#13;
assigned a certain amount of investment, and invited to work out their own&#13;
program to make the best use of these resources. Technicians were assigned to&#13;
give advice, but no interference of authorities was supposed to take place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Unfortunately, this social experiment was not carried out to its&#13;
end because of organizational difficulties and lack of sufficient persistence.&#13;
CIDER, however, continued its efforts to define a set of procedures for maxi-&#13;
mizing the participation of beneficiaries in the diagnosis and planning of&#13;
investments.&#13;
The concern for eliciting popular participation in the design of&#13;
investment programs led CIDER to create, more than three years ago, a special&#13;
Programming Section. This section was put in charge of designing and field-&#13;
testing alternative methodologies for participatory programming, in order to&#13;
prepare a set of procedures for use by the staff of PIDER and the cooperating&#13;
agencies in their preparation of development plans for microregions and&#13;
individual communities.&#13;
This task transcends, in fact, the strict evaluation function and&#13;
methodology, but it grew out of the findings of the evaluation effort. CIDER's&#13;
involvement in investment programs was mainly the result of their conclusions&#13;
from the short-term evaluations initially undertaken in several microregions.&#13;
CIDER found that a major problem in the PIDER program was the poor quality of&#13;
the investment programming and inadequate determination of the investments&#13;
most needed by the local communities. Thus, it was felt that an essential&#13;
methodological contribution which CIDER could make to improve PIDER imple-&#13;
mentation was to focus on developing programming guidelines involving the&#13;
local communities.&#13;
CIDER's comparative advantage in preparing guidelines for partici-&#13;
pating programming was its staff's better sociological understanding of com-&#13;
munity structures and values, village stratification and authority patterns.&#13;
Starting from the methodology previously applied by PIDER countrywide, CIDER&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
tested it first in the Mazahua microregion and subsequently improved and&#13;
retested it in the regions of Tejupilco (Mexico State), Eastern Morelos,&#13;
Ensenada (Northern Baja California), Chol, Cintalapa, Zoqe, Lacandona and&#13;
Bellavista (Chiapas), and others. The refinement of this methodology con-&#13;
tinued in Morelos, Southern Baja California and Yucatan (see Annex II,&#13;
introduction).&#13;
CIDER has focused its attention concerning participation on:&#13;
- (a) Identifying specific social organization patterns existing&#13;
in the Mexican context, particularly in the ejidos and in&#13;
the small farmers' communities, which could be built upon&#13;
or otherwise utilized in promoting grassroot participation&#13;
to government development activities.&#13;
- (b)  Identifying the forms most preferred by campesinos them-&#13;
selves for participation in rural development programs.&#13;
- (c)  Assessing the impact of public (state) investments on in-&#13;
creasing or decreasing the peasants' propensity to self-help.&#13;
The product of these experimental efforts is a set of operational&#13;
guidelines, which is a far cry from the typical idealistic (but impractical)&#13;
advocacy of popular participation in program design. Drawing heavily from&#13;
actual project experience, the CIDER methodology for programming suggests&#13;
the sequence of practical steps through which those who want to implement&#13;
bottom-up planning should follow. It gauges the diversity of social, cultural&#13;
and institutional obstacles potentially hindering the involvement of local&#13;
populations in project work, and articulates the tasks of the technicians&#13;
and planners in a logical operational sequence. A detailed summary of this&#13;
methodology is given in Annex II.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VII. EVALUATION PITFALLS&#13;
While carrying out the microregional evaluation studies, CIDER has&#13;
continuously improved its methodology. A close examination of the methodology&#13;
used, however, as well as direct discussions with CIDER staff, revealed some&#13;
weak spots in the evaluation procedures, particularly during the first phase&#13;
of CIDER's activities, in 1975-76. Some of them have been overcome by now&#13;
or are still being dealt with through refining the data collection procedures&#13;
and the analytical treatment of data. But these weaknesses seem to be recur-&#13;
rent in one form or another, in evaluation methodologies used under other&#13;
rural development projects as well, due to lack of sufficient experience in&#13;
ongoing evaluation of such large scale projects. Therefore, useful lessons&#13;
can be derived by pinpointing such pitfalls.&#13;
(a) Operationalization of hypotheses. Some of the research&#13;
hypotheses under which CIDER carried out evaluation research&#13;
initially were still too general and broad in scope. They&#13;
did not question and explore the assumed relationships between&#13;
project inputs and expected definite outputs, so as to be able&#13;
to narrow down the analysis and to measure whether the project&#13;
assumptions proved to be correct or not.&#13;
Operationalization of hypotheses was necessary for focusing&#13;
the evaluation research on issues directly consequential to&#13;
practical management decisions. Definitions for a restricted&#13;
list of key independent and dependent variables should have been&#13;
worked out and their relationships tested. The need to arrive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
at a relatively reduced number of indicators (for farm produc-&#13;
tivity and self-sustaining growth, peasant participation, self-&#13;
help, quality of life, etc.) was obvious but not much progress&#13;
has been accomplished in this respect.&#13;
(b) Insufficient quantification. There was insufficient concern&#13;
for introducing quantifying procedures in evaluation. Evalu-&#13;
ation of project progress was often largely impressionistic.&#13;
There was also an exaggerated use of open-ended questionnaires&#13;
and interviews, and the soft and uncodifiable information&#13;
collected made it difficult to aggregate findings by using&#13;
modern data processing techniques. Some reports (the case&#13;
studies in Guanajuato, for instance) were overburdened with&#13;
unnecessary descriptive information, at the expense of a&#13;
stronger analytical tact.&#13;
(c) Disaggregation. Since the unit of evaluation analysis was&#13;
the microregion as a whole, the evaluators were not able to&#13;
attribute a program's success to one or another specific&#13;
individual components. Nor was it possible to differentially&#13;
ascertain the degree of impact of various types of investments&#13;
on the forms and feed back to management clear advice as to&#13;
the comparative cost-effectiveness of alternative investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
(d) Orientation to the poverty group. The evaluation studies&#13;
lacked a direct emphasis on evaluating the impact of PIDER on&#13;
its expected ultimate beneficiaries - the poverty target group.&#13;
To a certain extent this was determined by the early stage in&#13;
project implementation. Nevertheless, even when the first&#13;
investments were completed, such in-depth evaluation of effects&#13;
at farm/household level was not undertaken. The concern for&#13;
assessing the overall institution-building effects was a valid&#13;
and timely one, but a somewhat better equilibrium between that&#13;
and the evaluation of the impact (or lack of it) felt directly&#13;
by the members of the poverty target group was required.&#13;
Another aspect of this evaluation shortcoming has some con-&#13;
ceptual implications as well. The microregions, regarded&#13;
by CIDER as the units of analytical interest, are poverty&#13;
regions. But the key concept of "poverty group" cannot be&#13;
interchanged with the concept of "poverty region"; these two&#13;
concepts are by no means equivalent and they lead to differ-&#13;
ent evaluation strategies. While both concepts are valid&#13;
and have explanatory power for PIDER design and evaluation,&#13;
they say undoubtedly different things and should not be sub-&#13;
stituted for each other. The concept of "poverty region"&#13;
provides a territorial/economic description for the project's&#13;
investment areas, while the "poverty group" is a social and&#13;
economic concept defining the expected main actors of the&#13;
project's development process. While the poverty group is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
homogeneously poor (below the country poverty level), a&#13;
"poverty region" may be a socially diversified and stratified&#13;
territorial entity, in which various social and economic strata&#13;
co-exist. By no means is the entire population of a poverty&#13;
region part of what is defined as the "poverty target group".&#13;
The evaluation analysis has therefore to make clear whether&#13;
the program is assisting, within the poverty microregions,&#13;
only those who are really poor, or also those groups who are&#13;
relatively better off, or possibly the latter alone. This is&#13;
both a conceptual and a pragmatic question.&#13;
Even if it were desirable, PIDER may not always be politically&#13;
and practically able to channel the investments only to the&#13;
poor inhabitants of the poverty microregions and may have to&#13;
assist the better-off farmers of these relatively destitute&#13;
areas (which sometimes are comparatively worse off than those&#13;
from other regions). Therefore a recurrent issue in PIDER,&#13;
as in all rural development projects, is to assess whether&#13;
the poor farmers get some benefits from project investments&#13;
or whether the richer farmers capture all these benefits.&#13;
The initial microregional evaluation reports produced by&#13;
CIDER did not address or clarify these issues. The evalua-&#13;
tion methodology should endeavor to answer this key question,&#13;
by focusing its analytical efforts on the poverty group and&#13;
on the farmer/household unit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
(e) Economic and Financial Analysis. The evaluation instruments&#13;
developed have been rather incomplete on the financial and&#13;
economic side. Cost overruns have been frequent; yet there&#13;
was no in-depth analysis of their causes. Also, an evaluation&#13;
of cost-benefit ratios for alternative investments were needed.&#13;
The ejido budgets (farm models) in the PIDER microregion plans&#13;
could easily be updated by periodic spot checks. These budgets&#13;
should also be disaggregated into partial farm/crop budgets (for&#13;
irrigation, rainfed, livestock, corn, etc.). A much stronger&#13;
concern for quantifying economic effects (on income, employment and&#13;
production at farm level) should be injected in the overall CIDER&#13;
approach on evaluating investments under PIDER.&#13;
(f)  Social absorption of new investments.    With the rapid pace&#13;
of PIDER's investments, a sociological constraint developed:&#13;
the absorptive capacity of certain target communities proved&#13;
too limited for taking over and operating the new infrastruc-&#13;
ture efficiently. The evaluation studies did not focus,&#13;
however, on the post-completion stage of PIDER investments,&#13;
to ascertain their actual integration into the village economy,&#13;
their uses or misuses, their effects on income, unanticipated&#13;
consequences, etc. For instance, CIDER's initial evaluation&#13;
studies did not explore what happens in the ejidos which receive&#13;
a livestock unit, in terms of creating appropriate organizational&#13;
arrangements, labor division, benefits distribution, self-&#13;
management, etc. This could be a very worthwhile analysis, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
unanticipated lessons to be derived. Only if the project does&#13;
learn how to assist the farmers in developing their own social&#13;
organization for absorbing new economic activities, one may&#13;
hope that a substantial self-sustaining growth capability will&#13;
be created and will outlast the project intervention.&#13;
VIII.  THE MID-TERM EVALUATION REVIEW&#13;
By the end of 1977, PIDER management, CIDER and the World Bank&#13;
agreed to undertake a joint mid-term evaluation of the first PIDER Rural&#13;
Development Project, which became effective in 1975 (see Section II of this&#13;
paper). This was a novelty in the overall effort for keeping track of PIDER's&#13;
implementation and impact. As it turned out, the work plan set up for carry-&#13;
ing out this mid-term review led to some significant changes and innovations&#13;
in the very methodology used by CIDER and PIDER for evaluating and monitoring,&#13;
as discussed below.&#13;
How is an overall evaluation at mid-point of an ongoing development&#13;
project to be set up? This is a point in time when the project's impact is&#13;
still far from being fully achieved, yet there is clear and urgent need for&#13;
assessing partial results, lessons and deriving decisions for the future.&#13;
Recently, the question about how to organize such mid-term reviews has arisen&#13;
more frequently in many projects, with little past experience available for&#13;
answering it. Since the PIDER mid-term evaluation exercise became an integral&#13;
part of the evaluation process, extending over about 10 months in 1978 and&#13;
producing substantial results, its experience may have transfer value for&#13;
other similar projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
It is therefore worthwhile to analyze the rationale, the objec-&#13;
tives, research techniques and the logistical set-up of this exercise, in&#13;
order (a) to understand better how the findings of this review were generated,&#13;
and (b) to provide a model which can be adjusted, when necessary, to setting&#13;
up mid-term evaluations in other projects.&#13;
(a) Objectives of Mid-Term Evaluation&#13;
The basic reason for the mid-term evaluation was to determine before&#13;
project completion (while remedial action can still be taken) the extent to&#13;
which project target groups are in fact benefitting from the implementation of&#13;
each project component; and the extent to which such components make any real&#13;
difference in farmer productivity and income at the farm and ejido levels.&#13;
It was the feeling of several previous Bank supervision missions,&#13;
as well as PIDER high management, that the evaluation studies which had been&#13;
carried out by CIDER and PIDER until then, might not have gone into sufficient&#13;
depth and detail, as far as the impact on beneficiaries' income and employment&#13;
was concerned. Therefore it was decided not to wait until project completion&#13;
for a full ex-post evaluation. As opposed to an ex-post evaluation, the&#13;
mid-term evaluation ought to result in corrections which can be implemented&#13;
during the life of the project - for instance, in proposed adjustments in&#13;
resource allocations, in implementation strategies, in institutional arrange-&#13;
ments, partially in project design.&#13;
More specifically, the objectives of the mid-term evaluation have&#13;
been defined as follows:&#13;
(a) to assess project implementation in terms of: (i) physical&#13;
progress by components and microregions; (ii) quality and&#13;
adequacy of project-constructed infrastructure, and (iii)&#13;
costs per unit as compared with original estimates;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
(b) to evaluate the impact on beneficiaries of the completed&#13;
investments in terms of increased productivity, incremental&#13;
income and intra-village income distributions, village social&#13;
organization for productive and marketing activities, employ-&#13;
ment effects, and self-sustaining growth prospectives in the&#13;
long run;&#13;
(c) to analyze the popular participation and managerial issues&#13;
in PIDER planning and implementation at the farm, ejido and&#13;
microregion levels, comparing what has been expected and&#13;
accomplished so far;&#13;
(d) to strengthen the implementation capacity in PIDER, to improve&#13;
the quality of management; to develop procedures for monitoring&#13;
and ongoing evaluation of project performance at PIDER center,&#13;
state and microregion levels;&#13;
(e) to define which re-adjustments, if any, should be introduced&#13;
into PIDER I and II to adapt the project design to the changing&#13;
Mexican context;&#13;
(f) to derive lessons of experience on rural development from&#13;
PIDER's strategy and from Bank's performance in Mexico, which&#13;
might be applicable both in Mexico and to other countries&#13;
starting rural development projects.&#13;
The mid-term evaluation exercise was also expected to improve the&#13;
permanent (regular) Project Management Information System. It could help&#13;
take comprehensive stock of what the PIDER I project has accomplished so far,&#13;
analyze in depth its successes and weaknesses, and significantly improve the&#13;
quality of implementation in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
The mid-term evaluation would achieve operational significance only&#13;
inasmuch as it would be able to feed back its findings into the daily process&#13;
of project management, remove bottlenecks and suggest a series of concrete&#13;
measures to improve PIDER's operations and results. In addition, the findings&#13;
of the mid-term review were expected to help prepare, readjust and appraise a&#13;
new Bank assisted project - PIDER III - as a further expansion of the PIDER&#13;
program.&#13;
(b) Methodology&#13;
Past experience with ongoing evaluation work in CIDER and PIDER&#13;
suggested that a significant change in the evaluation approach was necessary.&#13;
The principles for a revised methodology of impact evaluation were discussed&#13;
in detail between CIDER, PIDER, and The World Bank. In brief, the adopted&#13;
principles required:&#13;
(a) shifting from the geographical (area) approach towards an&#13;
analytical focus on the active productive units (households)&#13;
as investigation units for impact measurement;&#13;
(b)  disaggregating sectorally the impact analysis;&#13;
(c)  using additional data generation methods, in particular&#13;
sample surveys; and&#13;
(d)  integrating the sociological and economic analysis of&#13;
project effects on the beneficiaries.&#13;
Thus, PIDER's and CIDER's efforts in the mid-term evaluation&#13;
exercise would not only help produce the necessary information, but would&#13;
yield the additional benefit of instituting an improved pattern for subse-&#13;
quent monitoring and evaluation within the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
The mid-term evaluation exercise was planned for two phases:&#13;
Phase one: January-July 1978 - field evaluation studies and project monitor-&#13;
ing inventory in Mexico; and review and analysis of information existing in&#13;
the Bank. Phase two: Preparation of the aggregate final evaluation report&#13;
(August-October 1978).&#13;
To generate relevant information for the evaluation review, a com-&#13;
prehensive inventory of all PIDER civil works, either completed or in process&#13;
was started (see Section V, (d)) as a stocktaking operation. Besides the&#13;
physical identification of each PIDER financed investment and the assessment&#13;
of its degree of physical completion, the inventory assessed whether the com-&#13;
pleted investments have been put to actual use and to what degree.&#13;
Until the mid-term evaluation, the prevailing model for evaluation&#13;
studies in PIDER had been the comprehensive area study: this was the tradi-&#13;
tional microregional evaluation, which attempted to encompass all project&#13;
components in a geographical unit. This model often sacrificed depth and&#13;
causal analysis for a somewhat deceptive "comprehensive" coverage. The focus&#13;
was not on small farmers and did not grasp the project impact at the farm&#13;
level. Nor was it able to disaggregate or ascertain differential degrees of&#13;
impact of distinct sectors of investments. Therefore, it was proposed that&#13;
this type of study be replaced by the following evaluation models:&#13;
(a) Sectoral evaluation studies, focusing on the impact of&#13;
distinct project components -- primarily, the major pro-&#13;
ductive components (e.g. irrigation, livestock). These&#13;
studies should be cross-regional, not limited to one micro-&#13;
region, and should seek to capture the effects occurring&#13;
at the level of the farm unit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
(b) Case Studies of elidos or villages benefitting from PIDER&#13;
investments. This is a more manageable alternative to the&#13;
area (microregion)-based studies. Such a study (which is&#13;
multi-sectoral, but restricted to a rather limited area)&#13;
should attempt to capture the synergistic effect of several&#13;
project components on the life, economy, structure, institu-&#13;
tions and organization of individual communities.&#13;
(c) Issue-oriented strategy studies. These assessments are&#13;
broader in scope and should be issue-oriented (e.g., the&#13;
effectiveness of institution-building in PIDER, the build-up&#13;
of genuine self-sustaining capabilities, etc.); they should&#13;
evaluate whether the innovative principles built into PIDER's&#13;
decentralized and participatory strategy have proven to be&#13;
correct and effective under the circumstances, or what has&#13;
to be done in order to better implement them in the future.&#13;
Specifically, the following actual studies were undertaken by teams&#13;
of staff from CIDER, PIDER or INI (the National Institute for the Indigenous&#13;
Population):&#13;
1.   Irrigation:  Impact of PIDER-funded small scale irrigation&#13;
schemes on the productivity, cropping patterns and incomes&#13;
of beneficiaries' households (carried out by the PIDER staff);&#13;
2.   Livestock:  Livestock development under PIDER:   the effective-&#13;
ness of the project-built infrastructure and of credit funded;&#13;
3.   Rural Roads:   Impact of new roads on marketing, on employment&#13;
creation, and on labor mobility; community involvement in road&#13;
maintenance (CIDER study);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
4.   Apiculture:  The benefits of bee-keeping schemes for the&#13;
Indian population (carried out by the evaluation team of INI;&#13;
5.   Cattle Schemes for the Indian population:   Economic and&#13;
nutritional effects (carried out by INI staff);&#13;
6.   Village Development case studies (carried out by CIDER).&#13;
Strategy Evaluation Studies:&#13;
7.   Participation of the beneficiaries in village planning,&#13;
investment selection and project execution (started by&#13;
PIDER staff);&#13;
8.   Absorption of proiect outputs in target communities:&#13;
Is the social structure capable of assimilating the new&#13;
technical infrastructure? (This study is still in progress).&#13;
The studies listed above do not exhaust the sectors affected by&#13;
PIDER, but do cover some of its principal areas of potential impact. Extended&#13;
field visits by PIDER central staff and World Bank staff produced additional&#13;
information.&#13;
(c) Survey Design and Implementation&#13;
For the first time in its evaluation work, CIDER decided to carry&#13;
out cross-regional sample surveys. These surveys regarded the farm as their&#13;
ultimate investigation unit and focused on capturing the impact at the pro-&#13;
duction unit level of three sectoral investment programs. The sectors&#13;
selected were those which absorbed the principal share of the total invest-&#13;
ments made during (1) small-scale irrigation works, receiving 18% of the&#13;
total investments; (2) livestock development (9%), and (3) rural roads&#13;
construction (15%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
Four microregions were selected for carrying out the evaluation&#13;
survey: Southern Nuevo Leon, N.L.; Northeast Guanajuato, Gto; Eastern Morelos,&#13;
Mor; and Sur de Yucatan (Yuc). 1/&#13;
The criteria for selecting villages for the survey were linked to&#13;
the investments made, in order to ensure that evaluation would be done on&#13;
villages in which the "project treatment" had been previously applied. Each&#13;
village would have to have absorbed at least 20% of investments in these&#13;
sectors, and at least a portion in all three of them. Microregions in which&#13;
the investments in one of the three sectors had been either over-represented&#13;
or insignificant, were deliberately not selected. It was established that&#13;
the minimum number of communities to study per microregion would be four,&#13;
although the justification for such a procedure was not spelled out. 2/ In&#13;
the process, some pre-selection was made against these communities with works&#13;
not readily registering directly measurable impacts (such as a laboratory for&#13;
animal diagnoses servicing a regional livestock center).&#13;
The sample size was established at 10% of the total number of&#13;
beneficiaries. In those communities containing less than 60 recipients, the&#13;
ratio was higher than 10%, since at least six beneficiaries per small commu-&#13;
nity were included in the sample. The irrigation credit beneficiaries were&#13;
stratified by the amount of credit received per household group, resulting&#13;
in three strata (large, medium and small). At least two beneficiaries were&#13;
chosen per stratum, independently of the place they held in the local socio-&#13;
economic structure (which was reconstructed afterwards).&#13;

y Caminos en Cuatro Regiones," September 1978, Table 2, p. 72.&#13;
2/   Ibid., cf. p. 67.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Two questionnaires were designed for the sample survey, addressing&#13;
the beneficiaries of the irrigation and livestock programs. Schedules for&#13;
collecting more general data concerning the effects of rural road building&#13;
were also prepared. The adequacy of the questionnaires was pre-tested in&#13;
some localities in Morelos and adjustments were introduced.&#13;
One questionnaire was administered to the beneficiary households&#13;
(the head of the household was interviewed), requesting information regarding&#13;
the composition of the family, the family division of labor, availability of&#13;
resources (land, tools, machinery, livestock, etc.), gross value of production&#13;
and costs of agriculture and livestock-raising, utilization of costly tech-&#13;
nology and credit. In each of these categories, emphasis was placed on&#13;
identifying differences attributable to Program actions. Time limitations&#13;
precluded gathering firm data on family income and consumption patterns. The&#13;
second questionnaire compiled information from organized groups, which used&#13;
allocated project investments in some specific program. Its content was&#13;
similar to the questionnaire for the individual households, appropriately&#13;
adjusted. In the case of rural roads, guidelines were established for inter-&#13;
views with authorities of localities linked by roads, with merchants in these&#13;
localities, and with workers participating in road construction.&#13;
Four multi-disciplinary CIDER teams, one per microregion (consist-&#13;
ing of economists, sociologists, anthropologists, and agronomists) carried out&#13;
the sample survey in the designated villages. They randomly identified the&#13;
sample units, carried out the interviews and filled in the questionnaire&#13;
schedules. CIDER management supervised the teams directly in the field and&#13;
made corrections when sampling biases were spotted or interviewing procedures&#13;
were not properly observed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
An interesting feature consisted in complementing the CIDER survey&#13;
on a sample of respondents with additional collection of overall data about&#13;
the villages (localities) from which the sample units (households) were drawn.&#13;
The processing of the survey-generated information was carried out&#13;
rapidly 1/ and the results were analyzed both on their own and against the&#13;
overall background of the selected regions and localities. CIDER aggregated&#13;
these results in three different types of reports, which were submitted to&#13;
PIDER management, to interested state agencies, and to the World Bank., These&#13;
types of reports are:&#13;
(a) Three sectoral summaries of findings, by programs (irrigation,&#13;
livestock, rural roads);&#13;
(b) Four microregional reports;&#13;
(c) Twenty-one localities (village ejido) studies (which included&#13;
the farm level analysis).&#13;
Some findings from these reports are summarized below.&#13;
1/   CIDER's timetable for survey design/data collection, processing and&#13;
analysis was programmed as follows: One month was devoted to regional&#13;
selection, design and pre-testing of instruments, and integration of&#13;
methodology. The identification of the units in the sample, the actual&#13;
field survey and compiling of additional information occupied researchers&#13;
for one and one-half months. Another month was subsequently devoted to&#13;
data processing (manual), drafting preliminary assessments, discussion&#13;
of these, and preparation of the final evaluation of the three sectoral&#13;
programs. (CIDER, "Notas para la evaluacion de efectos de los programas&#13;
de infrastructura hidraulica, desarrollo ganadero, y caminos rurales en&#13;

IX. FINDINGS: IMPACT ON PROJECT BENEFICIARIES&#13;
The findings of the mid-term evaluation exercise are presented in&#13;
detail in a separate report, together with a set of recommendations for&#13;
revisions in the design, implementation procedures and institutional arrange-&#13;
ments of PIDER I and II. It is not the purpose of this paper to describe&#13;
these substantive conclusions but, rather, to analyze the approach used in&#13;
generating impact information. We will, however, present some selected&#13;
findings as illustrations of the types of quantitative and qualitative assess-&#13;
ments made. Among the most significant findings are those which, in the case&#13;
of irrigation works and rural roads, refer mainly to the impact on income&#13;
increases and uneven income distribution, and for livestock development, refer&#13;
mainly to the sociological variables.&#13;
(a) Income Consequences of Irrigation Works&#13;
CIDER investigations found that the irrigation works in the four&#13;
sample microregions had distinct effects on (a) production, (b) employment,&#13;
and (c) income. Regarding production in general, CIDER noted that the&#13;
water-works (1) diversified cropping patterns, favoring the introduction of&#13;
crops of greater commercial value; (2) increased productivity in the already-&#13;
cultivated areas, due to assured water supplies and improved complementary&#13;
inputs; and (3) increased areas under cultivation both by opening new lands&#13;
and introducing double-cropping. In Guanajuato, for example, maize production&#13;
on newly irrigated plots increased 245%, beans, 660%, and chiles, 1850%;&#13;
and cultivation expanded 22% in land area due to double-cropping alone. 1/ The&#13;

y Caminos en cuatro regiones PIDER," September 1978, pp. 22-23.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
aggregate value of production per hectare of irrigated land 1/ quintupled&#13;
in the period after the initiation of the PIDER program, reaching some 6,000&#13;
pesos per hectare.&#13;
The evaluation survey, however, also indicated that, within the&#13;
Guanajuato microregion, as well as in the other microregions, significant&#13;
variations occurred within the aggregate production figures. For instance, in&#13;
the community of Mision de Arnedo (Gto.), the aggregate value of production&#13;
per ha increased 1.5 times, while in the semi-collective ejido Vagui, produc-&#13;
tion increased 22 times. Production value increased 2.6 times on the average&#13;
in Eastern Morelos, reaching a value of 9,000 pesos; in Nuevo Leon, the&#13;
increases were smaller, varying between 2,500 and 5,000 pesos. 2/ CIDER&#13;
evaluation emphasizes, however, that most water works provide different&#13;
benefits to peasants even within the same locality, as "a function of the&#13;
existing land tenure stratification or of the effective power structure". 3/&#13;
In certain cases, CIDER found that the irrigation works have contributed to&#13;
local income disparities at the village and ejido level, between farmers who&#13;
obtain irrigation and those who do not, as well as among irrigation farmers&#13;
with land holdings of different sizes.     For instance, CIDER has estimated&#13;
that the range in irrigated landholdings from 0.5 to 6.5 ha in the Villa&#13;
Victoria project (Gto.) has created a potential net family income differential&#13;
of 1 to 13. 4/&#13;
1/   "Aggregate value" is defined by CIDER as "equal to the gross value of&#13;
total production less direct monetary costs, without imputing costs of&#13;
family labor contributed, or to other inputs contributed by the producer."&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
While irrigation works generally did not provide a significant rise&#13;
in employment during the construction phase, permanent additional employment&#13;
was created during the operation of the irrigated areas. In Eastern Morelos&#13;
some 48 man-days per hectare were generated; given the 2,000 hectares irri-&#13;
gated, employment equivalent to 350 permanent jobs was provided. 1/ The&#13;
sample survey was not in a position to find out who absorbed the labor&#13;
generated (follow-up and comparative studies are still necessary); but CIDER&#13;
did find that in Morelos, three of the four ejidos studied employed more&#13;
contract than peasant family labor, in the ratio of 1:3. In Northeast&#13;
Guanajuato, an average 72 man-days of labor was added by irrigation work,&#13;
an increase of 218% over pre-program opportunities for farm labor. 2/ Value&#13;
of work per man-day was also estimated as having increased from 50 to 77&#13;
pesos. This increment compares favorably with the average salary of 60&#13;
pesos earned by rural workers in the region. 3/ All together, with the&#13;
development of small irrigation systems, on-farm employment has now increased&#13;
- and this is extremely important for BOTH farmers and wage laborers.&#13;
As to income, CIDER estimated that the annual aggregate value of&#13;
production per hectare in Northeast Guanajuato averaged 8,000 pesos, 6,400&#13;
of which is attributable to PIDER investment. CIDER also calculates that&#13;
at least 90% of the aggregate value is absorbed by the peasant family as&#13;
the principal unit of production and consumption. While CIDER considers&#13;
that salaries of landless laborers have gone up in the area, the value&#13;
1/   Other participants in the PIDER mid-term evaluation exercise considered&#13;
CIDER's figures on employment to be high and subsequent studies are&#13;
underway.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
absorbed by the peasant family itself was higher, since the peasant household&#13;
members have been working more intensively on the watered lands. In areas&#13;
employing significant contract labor, such as Eastern Morelos, salaries have&#13;
likewise not kept pace. More workers are employed in this region (in a ratio&#13;
of 7:3) than family labor, but receive a wage unadjusted to the increase value&#13;
of irrigated land and output. Thus, contracting households absorb an even&#13;
greater share of surplus labor than in Guanajuato. CIDER observes that this&#13;
process contributes directly to the increased economic differentiation in the&#13;
area, especially that between landed and landless groups. 1/&#13;
CIDER thus concluded that "this concentration of investments in&#13;
irrigation accentuates the economic polarization between the communities of&#13;
one region and establishes unequal dependency relations.... This economic&#13;
inequality is not compensated in productive investments of equal weight in&#13;
the rest of the communities without irrigation; on the contrary, other com-&#13;
plementary PIDER investments (such as fruit trees) tend to be concentrated&#13;
in the few localities that have received water works." CIDER goes on to say&#13;
that even in areas where irrigation has been provided, "changes have not&#13;
been produced in cultivation patterns and only small increases [made] com-&#13;
pared to previous agricultural practices, due to deficiencies in technical&#13;
assistance and credit support. In other words, irrigation works have been&#13;
planned without defining an [overall] production strategy to maximize results&#13;
of the actual investments." 2/ The behavioral changes expected to occur as a&#13;
1/   CIDER's figures run thusly.   Wage laborers in Eastern Morelos earn 80&#13;
pesos daily, while the aggregate value of irrigated land per hectare&#13;
raises real wages (those "earned" by the family) to 130 pesos. The&#13;
aggregate value of irrigated land per hectare in Morelos is 9,100 pesos;&#13;
the number of man-days created per hectare is 70. If these are worked&#13;
in the ratio of 7:3 by contracted and family labor (as CIDER found), the&#13;
aggregate value of the labor put in by the irrigating peasant and his&#13;
family is 433 pesos per day, yielding a differential of 353 pesos over&#13;
actual wages paid.&#13;

consequence of providing the farmers with irrigation infrastructure have not&#13;
materialized. With the same investments, but with a better overall agricul-&#13;
tural strategy and direct technical and extension assistance to small farmers,&#13;
more production and income benefits could be derived in the future.&#13;
In CIDER's assessment, the above (and other) findings suggest that&#13;
the PIDER program's future efforts to increase the number of rural poor&#13;
benefitting from rural development should consider the following points:&#13;
First, the most immediate source of income to be derived is from&#13;
small-scale irrigation. Additional efforts should be made to&#13;
develop a means of extending benefits to the remaining target&#13;
population (40%) not yet receiving income benefits from the project;&#13;
Second, the income increases expected from other components seem to&#13;
have been overestimated at the start of the project. It also&#13;
appears that, assuming adequate technical assistance is provided,&#13;
fruit-tree production offers a good prospect of increasing some&#13;
family incomes. However, the benefits from the rainfed activities,&#13;
especially soil and water conservation works in dry areas, are not&#13;
income-increasing but rather have become a part of an income main-&#13;
tenance program. This observation suggests the need for examination&#13;
of other income generating prospects for the rural poor in these&#13;
areas.&#13;
Finally, despite substantial increases in income derived from&#13;
irrigation, the limited irrigated surface available to most&#13;
beneficiaries (between 1 and 2 ha) suggests that many of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
will still depend on a number of other income-increasing&#13;
activities. 1/   Therefore, the design of the PIDER project&#13;
must adapt itself to this reality, perhaps by offering the&#13;
beneficiary various income-generating activities in a cost-&#13;
effective manner. 2/&#13;
(b) Sociological Constraints on Livestock Development&#13;
Interesting sociological findings came out of CIDER's evaluation&#13;
of the effects of PIDER's investments in livestock development. Due to&#13;
existing social differentiation within the ejidos, as well as to the divergent&#13;
evolution of tenurial patterns in the case of agricultural land compared&#13;
to pasture commonland, the PIDER investments in livestock eventually favored&#13;
the wealthier ejidatarios, to the disadvantage of the poorer ones. Moreover,&#13;
in some cases social conflicts and direct clashes were generated within&#13;
communities among peasant groups with opposed interests, with PIDER unable to&#13;
anticipate, prevent or solve them satisfactorily.&#13;
PIDER I planned to support livestock development on some 800 ejidos.&#13;
Beef cattle development was to be the major investment involving land clear-&#13;
ing, pasture establishment, perimeter fencing and the provision of limited&#13;
cattle watering and handling facilities. To familiarize inexperienced ejidos&#13;
with modern systems of livestock management, PIDER devised a two-phased&#13;
1/   For example, CIDER has observed that most of the target area families&#13;
depend on wage labor for approximately 50% of their subsistence income.&#13;
In one of its case studies (Ejido San Rafael in the Sur de Nuevo Leon&#13;
micro-region), the CIDER evaluation study found that the wages from the&#13;
PIDER irrigation work comprised an average of 13% of the total family&#13;
income for the benefiting families.&#13;
2/   This topic would be a useful topic for PIDER's and CIDER's study&#13;
research program; CIDER is already exploring some of these options&#13;
in its research program, such as rural industries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
strategy. Initially, PIDER finances a small technical package of physical&#13;
infrastructure, the "basic pilot unit" to be run communally by the ejido.&#13;
For cattle, the package normally includes land clearing and pasture improve-&#13;
ment, a perimeter fence and handling yards. For poultry, bees and rabbits,&#13;
sheds and starter breeding stock are provided. A typical cattle unit would&#13;
involve such infrastruture for about 300 animal units for an ejido with an&#13;
average of 85 families (500 persons), equivalent to some 3 to 4 animal units&#13;
per family. For small stock and rabbits, chickens and bees, 10 to 15 members&#13;
of the ejido would normally form groups to jointly operate of such units.&#13;
In the second phase development credit provides the resources for acquiring,&#13;
cattle, sheep and goats, as well as the working capital for the "pilot units".&#13;
The mid-term evaluation of livestock investments found that their&#13;
effectiveness in generating production, income and employment has been greatly&#13;
reduced compared to appraisal estimates, primarily due to improper treatment&#13;
of the social factors. Through 1977, only 77 beef cattle-development units&#13;
(63% of appraisal estimates) were in operation, and livestock related invest-&#13;
ments in other ejidos were at various degrees of completion or use. According&#13;
to the results from the CIDER evaluation 1/, the major problems encountered&#13;
with the new livestock units consisted of a lack of adequate farmer group&#13;
organization for handling livestock, and an absence or delay of complementary&#13;
development credit. Since these livestock units have often been the first&#13;
productive investment in which ejido members must fully cooperate both&#13;
to construct and to operate the venture, substantial technical, social and&#13;
organizational assistance is especially important. This social engineering&#13;
assistance was not provided adequately.&#13;

1978, pp. 44-45.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
In a few areas, livestock ventures were more fruitful. In Sur&#13;
de Yucatan, for example, the coordination efforts of the PIDER staff achieved&#13;
the formation of livestock units that now are operating with moderate success.&#13;
CIDER finds that a considerable 24% of all ejidatarios in the sample communi-&#13;
ties studied have benefitted from livestock investments. Through voluntary&#13;
participation, part of the primary target group, that is, poor ejidatarios&#13;
with limited land and cattle resources, have been reached; some 74% of all&#13;
ejido members receiving cattle production units have actually participated in&#13;
project tasks. The livestock units generated both temporary *) and permanent&#13;
employment, totalling between 11,000 and 16,500 man-days in the 1973-77&#13;
period. The estimated average cost of creating a permanent job, however, was&#13;
exceedingly high.&#13;
In other areas, the results were less good. In Southern Nuevo Leon,&#13;
for instance, where the program consisted of pasture-sowing and fence con-&#13;
struction in common pastures, the pasture sowing has failed in the greater&#13;
part of the incorporated area and (in the sample ejidos) fences were found&#13;
destroyed, principally as a result of internal conflicts between the&#13;
ejidatarios with cattle (the minority) and the ejidatarios without cattle (the&#13;
majority), as well as conflicts between ejidos.&#13;
These ejidatarios with cattle, fearful that collective holdings&#13;
would be extended to the lands they use and that a greater quantity of cattle&#13;
would be incorporated into the common pastures, destroyed the few pastures&#13;
*)   These temporary jobs, created in the construction phase of implementa-&#13;
tion, did not continue through the phase of operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
that had succeeded in growing, and broke the fences enclosing them. Neigh-&#13;
boring ejidos who saw the path to their lands and watering places impeded by&#13;
the new fences were also responsible for fence breaking. The cattle-holding&#13;
peasants control political power in the ejidos, a fact which has impeded&#13;
pasture regulation and has slowed down the continuation of the program PIDER&#13;
conceived for these areas.&#13;
CIDER maintains, moreover, that PIDER and the agencies have paid&#13;
insufficient attention to the actual forms of production-oriented social&#13;
organization, which, if better utilized, would have led to greater peasant&#13;
involvement. Rather than making use of ejido-wide or sub-ejido groups capable&#13;
of absorbing management or technical skills necessary for the livestock&#13;
operations, the livestock units financed and established are in fact so&#13;
capital-intensive and administratively complex and alien that they "have&#13;
induced the very supporting project agencies to continue controlling the&#13;
units." 1/ Many peasants also failed to participate because (1) they lacked&#13;
precise information on the conditions of incorporation, (2) were afraid of&#13;
assuming debts for livestock purchases, and (3) because one condition of&#13;
involvement required fajinas, or partially non-remunerated labor. Other&#13;
ejidatarios left the project at crucial moments in the cultivation cycle to&#13;
attend to their own plots, and had to be replaced by day-laborers. 2/ CIDER&#13;
points out that proper programming should have accounted for seasonality in&#13;
the agricultural cycle, "given the rotational character of cultivation in&#13;
Yucatan with long fallow cyles that would have permitted the interpolated&#13;
introduction of pasture-sowing." 3/&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
The evaluation analysis thus indicated that the social and power&#13;
structure in certain ejidos, as well as the peculiar characteristics of the&#13;
land ownership and usufruct system account for the deprivation of legitimate&#13;
benefits to the smaller peasants and for the diversion of the principal&#13;
livestock development gains towards the larger farmers.&#13;
Agricultural land is a resource over whose distribution the community&#13;
exercises great social control. In the majority of the ejidos, the individual&#13;
plots were initially of equal size. In time, however, through inheritance and&#13;
other accumulation/distribution mechanisms, these plots have undergone unequal&#13;
changes in size. The ejido pasture lands, however, are typically undivided.&#13;
This permits those peasants with more cattle to utilize the undivided pastures&#13;
to their advantage, maintaining and reproducing a greater number of cattle on&#13;
them, without any benefits accruing to the other members of the community.&#13;
There are very few ejidos in which the community has succeeded in imposing a&#13;
regulation of pastures or any other instrument of social control which impedes&#13;
inequitable use of the common pastures, or enforces proportional payment&#13;
for use of this resource.&#13;
The livestock programs backed by the agencies have, in general,&#13;
been unaware or insufficiently aware of the social organizational forms&#13;
and level of development of the peasant units involved. In none of the cases&#13;
studied has CIDER found a program of peasant livestock development which takes&#13;
systematic account of the social conditions of livestock exploitation (dif-&#13;
ferentiation of cattle holdings and its relations to the community power&#13;
structure; use of summer pastures and social control of this resource);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
technical conditions (e.g., cattle genetic quality, feeding, animal health,&#13;
productivity indices, pasture management) and the requirements from the&#13;
available social organizations of labor for proper operation. I/&#13;
CIDER, therefore, recommended that the livestock-raising program&#13;
suspend new investments, except in those cases where the above limitations&#13;
are not present, until complying with the following objectives: (1) to&#13;
select among the previous investment schemes those which have operative&#13;
viability and to concentrate efforts on obtaining their adequate function-&#13;
ing on a small scale; (2) to carry out studies directed toward fitting the&#13;
alternatives for livestock-raising to the conditions which meet the original&#13;
poverty orientation of PIDER and the capabilities of its beneficiaries. 2/&#13;
CIDER's evaluation reports recommended that the small livestock&#13;
programs supported by PIDER, especially goat-keeping, sheep-keeping and&#13;
beekeeping projects, were more viable, under the given circumstances, than&#13;
large beef cattle programs, and therefore more investments should be allocated&#13;
in the future to small stock systems.&#13;
Significant conclusions regarding the correct sociological treatment&#13;
of the developmental issues involved in establishment of livestock units might&#13;
be derived from these findings. Such conclusions should point out that the&#13;
social factors embeded in the expansion of livestock raising are not neces-&#13;
sarily -- and should by no means be regarded -- as unsurmountable obstacles&#13;
to PIDER's efforts for livestock development. It is only because these social&#13;

Regiones PIDER, September, 1978, p. 8.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
factors were overlooked when the investments for livestock were designed or/&#13;
and implemented, that these factors "took revenge". In other terms, their&#13;
neglect left gaps in the design of the livestock units and these gaps provoked&#13;
the low effectiveness or straight failure of many such units. If these social&#13;
factors, the "software" of development packages, would be taken into account&#13;
properly during the preinvestment stage, the likelihood of success in PIDER&#13;
livestock investments would be greatly enhanced.&#13;
In its recommendations, CIDER emphasized the fundamental need&#13;
for PIDER to assess and take advantage of existing local social organization&#13;
for livestock development purposes. This refers both to group-wide and in-&#13;
group structures capable of performing productive tasks, such as the management&#13;
of livestock by ejidos or groups of peasant households, and to the linkages&#13;
between villages or ejidos which exert constraints on project implementation&#13;
in turn. Group programming must account for patterns in land distribution,&#13;
relations between households, and leadership potential in order to see how&#13;
animals can be distributed among cooperating groups for improved farm manage-&#13;
ment and increased income generation. A knowledge of individual and collective&#13;
pasture holdings must be gained in order to forestall conflicts between larger&#13;
landholders (both inside and outside the ejidos) who feel threatened by the&#13;
consolidation of the less powerful landholders, and that smaller landholding&#13;
group itself. The constraints on the poorer peasants' group - the need to&#13;
attend to cultivation plots as well as to tend to animals, the tightness of&#13;
credit, the fundamental need for technical assistance - must be addressed&#13;
simultaneously, so that peasants individually and as a group are prepared to&#13;
allocate and coordinate resources for increased livestock and overall rural&#13;
development. Appropriate planning can also involve landless laborers in the&#13;
cattle-development process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
The overall conclusion of this sectoral evaluation points out the&#13;
need for building/developing the social organization for cattle development,&#13;
at the same time, if not even before, building up the physical infrastructure&#13;
for livestock units. By "social organization" in this case one should under-&#13;
stand the engineering of social arrangements, of the patterns of work coopera-&#13;
tion and benefit distribution and the adjustment to existing land tenure&#13;
systems, setting up the division of responsibilities within affected com-&#13;
munities and the linkages with other village activities.&#13;
(c) Socio-Economic Impact of Rural Roads&#13;
Of the four microregions surveyed, rural road investments ranged&#13;
from 7.2% of total investments in Eastern Morelos to 27.6% in Sur de Yucatan.&#13;
Construction was devoted to three types of roads: (1) trunk or circuit lines,&#13;
connecting localities, (2) feeder roads, linking two localities or one to a&#13;
trunk line; and (3) roads to production units. All three forms employed in&#13;
variable magnitude both local labor and heavy machinery.&#13;
CIDER found that in particular Sur de Yucatan benefitted from heavy&#13;
investments, which led not only to the largest extension in roads built (232.2&#13;
km compared to 70, 100, and 154 km in the other three microregions), but also&#13;
to the highest proportion of roads finished and in use (91.1%), compared to&#13;
59.1%, 81.2%, and 69.2% in Nuevo Leon, Morelos, and Guanajuato). Sur de&#13;
Yucatan also allotted 39% of its road budget to employing local labor, in&#13;
accordance with the stated PIDER goal of beneficiary participation: figures&#13;
available for two other regions indicate a much smaller percentage of local&#13;
use, namely 12.5% and 15.6% in Guanajuato and Morelos. 1/&#13;
1/   Ibid., pp. 55-56, 61-62.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
In Nuevo Leon, where the largest absolute amount was invested in&#13;
the rural roads component, problems have arisen due to deficiencies in con-&#13;
struction. Nuevo Leon also represents the microregion absorbing the most&#13;
man-days worked (totalling some 115,500 compared to 48,000 in Yucatan and&#13;
much smaller aggregates in Morelos and Guanajuato). CIDER determined never-&#13;
theless that the roads provided cost reductions of 70% in goods transport.&#13;
Benefits varied within regions as well. CIDER's overall findings&#13;
for Northeast Guanajuato indicate that roads were first built in flat zones&#13;
of the region, to the disadvantage of more needy subregions; a shift in&#13;
emphasis has tried to correct the strategy. Although labor was sought from&#13;
the localities benefitting directly from road construction, PIDER was also&#13;
obliged to look for construction workers in neighboring localities as well.&#13;
CIDER has also collected reports of needs for road repair and conservation&#13;
in the microregions (excluding Yucatan). Roads have provided access to&#13;
fertilizer supplies, stimulating peasant organizations to seek their purchase&#13;
through road use; commercial activities have increased, notably through&#13;
the sale of fruits to local markets; and access to institutional services&#13;
such as technical assistance has been improved. 1/ Only a small portion&#13;
of the roads constructed, however, have been turned over to the appropriate&#13;
conservation program.&#13;
CIDER's general recommendations for the program call for better&#13;
coordination of local employment in road building and maintenance with the&#13;
"dead" season in the agricultural cycle. The reorientation would require&#13;
better PIDER budgeting of investments authorization which currently fall&#13;
three or four months behind schedule. 2/ It should also be noted that CIDER&#13;

called previously for the incorporation of the rural roads program into&#13;
the national program (SAHOP). The application of CIDER's new methodology&#13;
for roads evaluation in 1979 should complement the analysis. Disaggregated&#13;
data detailing the type and degree of benefits derived from road construction&#13;
and use have yet to be provided.&#13;
(d) Lessons on Beneficiaries' Participation&#13;
Since the beginning of PIDER, management viewed people's par-&#13;
ticipation as a critical element for determining the success of the program&#13;
and undertook greater effort to promote such direct participation than had any&#13;
other program in Mexico. CIDER's findings have confirmed the significant&#13;
correlation between project success and popular participation.&#13;
Given, however, the high initial PIDER objectives, the overall&#13;
participation actually achieved throughout the project cycle should still be&#13;
considered as limited, despite the real progress made. Until late 1976, most&#13;
of the people's participation has been in the form of PIDER and agency staff&#13;
getting the elected village leaders to: (i) submit a request of works desired,&#13;
and/or (ii) approve the works suggested by the agencies or by PIDER staff.&#13;
Too rarely has participation taken the form of voluntary labor for local PIDER&#13;
projects. The extent of participation achieved in the construction and&#13;
continued maintenance of the works is far from the level which was intended.&#13;
To begin with, neither PIDER nor the World Bank was aware of the tremendous&#13;
sociological and political difficulties involved in generating participation.&#13;
The experience to date clearly shows that promoting peasant participation is a&#13;
lengthy and slow process, but one that can and must be initiated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
Second, the programming methodology actually followed was either not&#13;
adequate enough, or not consistently implemented, to elicit the participation&#13;
desired. Initially , both the PIDER staff and the executing agencies ident-&#13;
ified many of the PIDER projects through "petitions" of villagers (primarily&#13;
by the elected leaders and not through village asemblies). These petitions&#13;
were assessed and investments then selected in light of their technical and&#13;
economic feasibility, and in view of existing financial constraints 1/.&#13;
By 1977, PIDER management began systematically to implement village-level&#13;
questionnaires as a means of identifying villagers' preferences and dev~elopment&#13;
possibilities. The intention has been to use this information as input&#13;
for the annual investment reprogramming exercise. However, the PIDER state&#13;
staff have only completed the questionnaires for approximately 20% of the&#13;
target villages. This slow progress has been due to the PIDER coordinators'&#13;
lack of time and to an insufficient absorption and/or inconsistent application&#13;
of the Guidelines for participatory programming (see Annex III). The initial&#13;
"petitioning process" has not involved all the groups and strata in the&#13;
villages (particularly the poorer one). It has also suffered, in particular,&#13;
from not following the procedure of integrating the final list of projects&#13;
selected by the PIDER staff within the context of beneficiary priorities&#13;
(stated explicitly) and within an explicit village-level and intra-micro-&#13;
regional development strategy. Therefore, some of the projects have often not&#13;
really been what the beneficiaries wanted in the first place. In some cases&#13;
they are not consistent with a desirable development strategy that ought to&#13;
reach a large number of the rural poor.&#13;
1/   This process was always undertaken with strong time pressures, which&#13;
tended to produce an effect contrary to that intended.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
A third difficulty in achieving desirable progress in people's&#13;
participation, which is related to the above two, is that the promoters&#13;
sent by the Secretariat for Agrarian Reform have played a limited role&#13;
in the entire process and have not received the expected support and backing&#13;
from their own agency.&#13;
Notwithstanding the constraints discussed above, several of the&#13;
executing agencies were able to organize the beneficiaries, once the projects&#13;
were selected. In particular, the success of the local level committees for&#13;
the labor-intensive rural road construction program suggests that an effec-&#13;
tive organizational structure at the local level can be established and can&#13;
facilitate the execution and operation of the program. 1/&#13;
Significant participation has also been achieved in the implementa-&#13;
tion of some social infrastructure works. One of PIDER's major benefits&#13;
has been the access provided to such social infrastructure to a large number&#13;
of the rural poor, who otherwise would not have received them. Through&#13;
1977 some 59,400 families had received benefits from potable water supply,&#13;
which surpasses the appraisal estimate of providing some 58,000 families with&#13;
social infrastructure. Village observations revealed that the beneficiaries&#13;
have placed a high value on their children gaining access to potable water,&#13;
health facilities, and schools. They often have expressed a hope that the&#13;
schools will now enable their children to gain a primary education, something&#13;
they view as necessary for their children's well-being. 2/ The access to the&#13;
1/   At the same time, these committees were effective because of a "strong"&#13;
and competent executing agency. This suggested again that PIDER should&#13;
place high importance on initiating reform in the "weaker" agencies that&#13;
are important to PIDER's investment program.&#13;
2/   The importance that the parents often attach to providing their children&#13;
with an education is reflected by the fact that many have used their&#13;
profits from the irrigation works not for direct productive reinvest-&#13;
ment in their farms, but for sending their children to nearby high&#13;
schools. This pattern was documented by the CIDER evaluation team&#13;
in Morelos.&#13;

potable water has been highly praised by the female population; women who have&#13;
saved time and effort have begun, in some cases, to diversify their activities&#13;
(i.e., such as towards home gardening and dressmaking). The beneficiaries&#13;
highly welcomed and used the access to improved health services, which was to&#13;
be expected, given that sickness is frequently the major cause of the family's&#13;
financial debt. Often, the construction of the social infrastructure was sped&#13;
up by local participation and contribution of local labor resources.&#13;
Despite these substantial benefits, preliminary data suggest that&#13;
a large proportion of the rural population (as high as 60%) in the PIDER&#13;
I microregions still lacks basic social infrastructure, and that efforts&#13;
to mobilize beneficiary participation were weak or lacking. 1/&#13;
From the mid-term evaluation, PIDER and CIDER derived important&#13;
conclusions regarding the practical procedures for increasing people's par-&#13;
ticipation. The numerous works that are not operating either due to a lack&#13;
of and/or inadequate beneficiary maintenance and a lack of program coordina-&#13;
tion and/or technical assistance, suggest the need to strongly formalize&#13;
the village-level organizational structure and to institutionalize the pro-&#13;
cess of people's participation. The programming of investments should shift&#13;
from an integration of investments at the microregional level to one at the&#13;
village level. This shift would enhance substantially the project's ability&#13;
1/   Low cost-effectiveness has been the primary reason for not extending&#13;
these works to villages of less than 300 inhabitants (which have&#13;
roughly 45% of the rural population in the selected microregions).&#13;
It seems now desirable, however, to consider alternative designs and&#13;
delivery systems for these settlements as well, combined with a much&#13;
stronger drive to mobilize available local resources by "involving&#13;
more the direct beneficiaries and thus reduce cost and increase&#13;
effectiveness."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
to target its investments within the heterogeneous PIDER microregions to&#13;
respond more flexibly to the variety of local needs at village levels, and&#13;
to stir the interests of the villagers. Although major steps have been&#13;
taken to strengthen the extension and agrarian reform agencies, these changes&#13;
are not yet fully apparent at the local level. Considerable effort must&#13;
still be given to promoting adequate implementation of the participatory&#13;
programming methodology. INI's tangible achievements in organizing bene-&#13;
ficiary participation among the indigenous population in the INI centers&#13;
areas are a confirmation that such participation is feasible and advisable&#13;
for economic and other reasons. On this point, CIDER's field-derived and&#13;
tested programming methodology (see Annex 3) provides useful guidance and its&#13;
application by the PIDER staff should be more consistent.&#13;
In brief, this procedure, improved by the lessons of the mid-term&#13;
evaluation, contains the following steps: first, an explicit and in-depth&#13;
diagnosis of the microregion's resource profile and development possibilities&#13;
should be undertaken. 1/ On this basis, an explicit investment strategy&#13;
should be devised, expressed in time and space (intra-microregional) dimen-&#13;
sions. The village-level questionnaires should be used to assess village&#13;
priorities. This step could be done simultaneously with the previous two,&#13;
which should seek the inputs from not only village ejido leaders, but also&#13;
from villagers. After this process is completed, a broad investment program&#13;
should be derived at the village level over a five-year period, considering&#13;
the financial constraints, the pre-established strategy and village priori-&#13;
ties. The specific investment programming should be undertaken on an annual&#13;
1/   Although most PIDER microregions followed this general procedure, the&#13;
time pressures have tended to limit the depth of analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
basis, where consideration is given to the financial constraints, the&#13;
previously-defined strategy, and village priorities. Inevitably, after the&#13;
budget for the entire program is authorized, the original program at the&#13;
microregion level will have to be adjusted. It is at this point that the&#13;
PIDER state staff should return 1/ to the village level to negotiate the&#13;
selection process on this "second round." This process will further con-&#13;
solidate the villagers' decision-making role in the project.&#13;
(e) The Impact Evaluation Workshop&#13;
While the findings and recommendations illustrated above are of&#13;
crucial importance for further PIDER implementation, they in fact represent&#13;
only a small fragment of the vast amount of new information and analytical&#13;
conclusions generated by this mid-term evaluation effort.&#13;
The mid-term evaluation exercise proved itself to be worth every&#13;
bit of effort which went into its planning and implementation. Not only did&#13;
it produce new hard information, but also instituted a "stock-taking" climate,&#13;
an in-depth reflective effort among the PIDER staff, and created a propitious&#13;
context for critical self-examination of past performance. PIDER management&#13;
and staff had the opportunity to compare various experiences, to perceive&#13;
where corrections are urgently needed, and are now in a better position for&#13;
redefining plans and approaches for future program implementation.&#13;
1/   Generally speaking, the government agencies rarely return to the villages&#13;
to explain budgetary decisions that are taken in the state capital and/or&#13;
Mexico City. This tends to weaken the efforts to promote people's par-&#13;
ticipation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
To sum up the main findings and to extract their lessons, a special&#13;
evaluation workshop was convened in January-February 1979, attended by PIDER&#13;
management and senior staff, CIDER management, representatives of some&#13;
agencies, World Bank and IDB staff. The in-depth discussions focused on&#13;
the major strategy and institutional changes which need to be implemented.&#13;
The conclusions of the evaluation seminar, while confirming the general&#13;
thrust of PIDER, recommended more emphasis on the overall strategy of social&#13;
change and development underlining PIDER, rather than on piecemeal investments.&#13;
Support for increasing the production potential and improving the social&#13;
organization of target peasant groups was reiterated to be essential. As the&#13;
document summarizing the general conclusion indicated,&#13;
"It is considered indispensable and thoroughly effective, that among&#13;
PIDER objectives the criterion of productive potentiality of the&#13;
investments have a fundamental role. This is important given the&#13;
scarcity of resources in relation to the magnitude of the rural&#13;
problem and the consequent necessity of promoting self-sustained&#13;
development. It is also a priority objective of PIDER to make&#13;
possible the complementarity between these objectives. It is there-&#13;
fore recommended that PIDER actions promote the organization of the&#13;
producers for transforming forms of production according to the&#13;
courses and guidelines that the organized workers themselves, with&#13;
institutional support, decide upon. We are aware of the risks and&#13;
difficulties involved in this process, but in present-day conditions&#13;
in Mexico there exists no better alternative." 1/&#13;
A number of related factors suggested that PIDER should reassess&#13;
its statement of objectives and strategy, in order to add more content to&#13;
its objective of increasing incomes of rural poor.&#13;
First, PIDER's concept of microregion selection criteria needs to&#13;
be refined if PIDER is to extend further its coverage and to target its&#13;
benefits to all rural poor. For example, approximately 35% of the total rural&#13;
population in PIDER I 30 microregions, consisting mostly of rural poor, have&#13;
1/   "Conclusiones Generales del Seminario de Auto-Evaluacion de PIDER",&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
been ineligible for inclusion in the project because they lived outside the&#13;
PIDER village-sized limits (i.e., in villages having less than 300 in-&#13;
habitants. 1/) Although this exclusion was based on a cost-effective argument,&#13;
PIDER's interest in the rural poor suggests that PIDER needs to reassess its&#13;
criteria for selecting localities so as. to include additional poverty groups&#13;
in its program. One of PIDER's future challenges is to develop low-cost&#13;
community and productive technical packages (such as potable water, irrigation,&#13;
schools, health, etc.) to assist the smallest and poorest communities.&#13;
Second, PIDER's strategy should be more vigorously geared toward the&#13;
very large group of poor farmers who still depend on rainfed agriculture,&#13;
often in areas having less than 800 mm annual rainfall. Adding to these&#13;
resource constraints, 25% of the economically active population in the PIDER&#13;
microregions are landless, and thus depend on wage labor. Therefore, PIDER's&#13;
strategy should intensify the exploring and testing of various alternatives&#13;
for increasing the income and employment of this large social group and for&#13;
developing non-agricultural activities.&#13;
X.   FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE M &amp; E SYSTEM&#13;
The PIDER mid-term evaluation, as an atypical exercise, complemented&#13;
the regular monitoring and evaluation system operating in PIDER. During this&#13;
exercise, the implementors of the program joined forces with the professional&#13;
evaluators, put together their data, compared results and derived lessons from&#13;
their experiences. The entire exercise confirmed the vital utility of a&#13;
strong M &amp; E system, built into the program and continually operating along-&#13;
side the project. Now, some specific conclusions about how to improve the&#13;
system can also be reached.&#13;
1/   In some isolated cases the PIDER investments did include some villages&#13;
having between 200 and 300 inhabitants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
Basically, there are two essential directions to follow in the&#13;
effort for improving the PIDER M &amp; E system: (a) organizational development&#13;
and (b) methodological refinement.&#13;
(a) Organizational Strengthening&#13;
On the organizational side, rigorous enforcement by the central&#13;
management of the reporting procedures within PIDER appears to be mandatory.&#13;
Timely reporting should allow, from now on, continuous updating of the over-&#13;
all 1978 PIDER' inventory, and permit good housekeeping within such a huge&#13;
project. In this respect, the enforcement of periodic auditing procedures&#13;
could be of more help in the future if the audits based primarily on&#13;
accounting documents were accompanied by an increased number of physical&#13;
audits.&#13;
The reporting mechanism in PIDER should also be streamlined to&#13;
channel essential information faster. Implementation monitoring should be&#13;
complemented by expeditious monitoring of investments in the post-completion&#13;
phase, to assess whether or not completed investments are being operated by&#13;
those expected to use them. This, in fact, is a way to include the feedback&#13;
from project beneficiary farmers in the regular monitoring flow, which would&#13;
represent a definite improvement in monitoring mechanisms.&#13;
A further step would be a firmer institutionalization of monitoring&#13;
and evaluation procedures within the agencies participating in PIDER (pri-&#13;
marily within SARH, SAHOP, CFE, FIRA, SRA, and INI). For the time being,&#13;
there are obvious imbalances in the capabilities of the major agencies par-&#13;
ticipating in PIDER for monitoring and evaluating their own programs. Some&#13;
of these agencies do not have either the resources or a systematic concern&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
for evaluation. This considerably weakens the PIDER monitoring and evaluation&#13;
system as a whole and adversely affects the flow of information within and&#13;
between the participating agencies.&#13;
It appears essential, then, to strengthen the organizational frame-&#13;
work for monitoring and self-evaluation in each one of the agencies responsi-&#13;
ble for a certain PIDER component. Experience suggests that if evaluation&#13;
findings emanate only from CIDER, they have a long way to go to reach the&#13;
central managements of participating agencies, and somehow they are often&#13;
lost on their way. The establishment of a network of small evaluation units&#13;
in these agencies could provide a double advantage: (a) it would articulate&#13;
the feedback information directly into the managerial process of these agen-&#13;
cies; (b) it would provide contact points and partners for CIDER evaluators,&#13;
thus promoting better coordination of evaluation efforts and a speedier&#13;
communication of results. This decentralization of evaluation activities&#13;
would also enable CIDER (and PIDER central management) to concentrate on&#13;
more in-depth studies and to capture the synergistic effects of the program&#13;
components.&#13;
Organizational strengthening could also be achieved through a firmer&#13;
institutionalization of the linkages between CIDER and various national level&#13;
policy making bodies. Currently, there is no effective institutional hook-up&#13;
mechanism for feeding forward CIDER's findings to crucial decision making&#13;
levels, in addition to, and beyond, PIDER management. CIDER's capacity to&#13;
inform plannng and analysis of expenditures has not been taken advantage of&#13;
by various central government agencies, because of the lack of institutional&#13;
channels of communication and interaction. A well structured, formal tying&#13;
into public-sector programs could both help CIDER to reflect better on the true&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
national priorities in rural development and maximize the benefits for&#13;
other development institutions from CIDER produced knowledge.&#13;
(b) Methodological Refinements&#13;
Improving the research methodology remains the first priority in&#13;
CIDER evaluation work. Building upon its accummulated experience, particu-&#13;
larly on the new methods used in the mid-term evaluation exercise, CIDER&#13;
has to achieve significant progress in quantifying the evaluation assess-&#13;
ments and in producing more hard information on project beneficiaries.&#13;
The in-depth study of the crucial micro unit - the peasant household&#13;
- is only in the beginning stages at CIDER. The sample surveys should become&#13;
a regular (but not exclusive) method of data generation, using much shorter&#13;
interview schedules and significantly larger samples. CIDER could thus&#13;
considerably improve its performance by systematically absorbing statistical&#13;
procedures and farm management analyses in its regular work.&#13;
CIDER ought to explore ways of using its evaluation researchers more&#13;
intensively by deploying its staff in the field on a more or less permanent&#13;
(or extended) basis. This procedure would enable CIDER evaluators to do&#13;
continuous surveying and participant observation of farmers' behavior, rather&#13;
than carry out only single-visit, time-limited surveys. Maximum effectiveness&#13;
can be achieved only if the current ratio of time spent by CIDER staff in&#13;
headquarters and in the villages will be significantly changed in favor of&#13;
more field time.&#13;
What has been until recently the main methodological shortcoming&#13;
of previous evaluation work in PIDER now remains the main challenge for&#13;
future refinement: namely, the ability to analyze the project's actual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
impact at the level of the ultimate beneficiary and his/her productive unit,&#13;
his/her income and employment. It may be somehow surprising to find out that&#13;
even after lengthy evaluation efforts and the large amounts of data collected&#13;
on various project components, there is to date still little specific under-&#13;
standing about the working of the small family household. In the future,&#13;
CIDER's ongoing evaluation should penetrate more incisively into the socio-&#13;
economic fabric of the peasant household and assess whether or not the&#13;
project's investments can be absorbed within the means and capabilities of the&#13;
poorest units and are consequential for the operation of these units.&#13;
The fundamental unit in the peasant agricultural sector is not the&#13;
"farm enterprise" as such (as conventional agricultural economics used to&#13;
consider), but the family household. In the case of the poverty group par-&#13;
ticularly, the main characteristic of the peasant economy is that the family&#13;
household is at one and the same time a unit of production and a unit of&#13;
consumption. To regard it as a strictly economic entity is a fallacy. The&#13;
sociology of this type of unit is intricately interwoven into its economy.&#13;
Only if this small but complex and delicately balanced socio-economic family&#13;
household unit becomes the unit of analytical interest in project evaluation&#13;
can we hope to answer whether or not PIDER has equity and income distribution&#13;
impact for the small farmer. The focus of project evaluation should be&#13;
changed, so as to center the impact analysis on the fundamental unit in the&#13;
peasant sector - the family household.&#13;
For future evaluation work it is crucial that CIDER also embark on&#13;
the explicit comparative study of the production strategies of various cate-&#13;
gories of peasant households. To adjust its financial and technical packages&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
properly, PIDER needs more factual knowledge of the smallholder unit, such as:&#13;
what changes are taking place in subsistence as well as in market-oriented&#13;
production? With what household variables are the differences in smallholders'&#13;
cropping patterns associated? Which are the trade-offs between various&#13;
agricultural and non-agricultural options available to the peasant household?&#13;
What competition may there be seasonally for household labor? Are there&#13;
non-economic exchanges between households? How does the household decision-&#13;
making process on production and consumption issue proceed? Can the small&#13;
farmer generate and save surpluses for reinvestment and what is the rationale&#13;
of his expenditures for the health or the welfare of this family? Distinct,&#13;
adequate analysis should be made on particular types of households, like, for&#13;
instance, the female headed households and their options and production&#13;
strategies. The evaluation research techniques used by CIDER should be&#13;
adjusted to answer precisely these types of socio-cultural and economic&#13;
questions.&#13;
The approach to evaluating development should change as the philo-&#13;
sophy of induced agricultural development itself has changed and is changing&#13;
with time.&#13;
There was a period in Mexico when agricultural sciences were thought&#13;
to answer all agricultural needs and resolve all problems. This belief was&#13;
sustained for a while by the spectacular breakthrough in plant breeding,&#13;
produced, particularly in Mexico, by the green revolution. But, as in any&#13;
development process, easing one constraint only permitted expansion until the&#13;
next constraint became limiting. The once-heady illusions of agricultural&#13;
research producing shortcuts to economic improvement gave way to the realiza-&#13;
tion that scientific technologies alone cannot work development miracles and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
that the consequences of the agro-technical progress aggravated the socio-&#13;
economic differentiation of farmers.&#13;
Subsequently, agricultural economics was called into the forefront&#13;
as the ultimate key to agro-economic development. But, despite the major&#13;
contribution of agricultural economics to development thought and action, the&#13;
discipline tended to treat the small agricultural holding as a standard&#13;
capitalist "enterprise", overlooking its non-economic characteristics as a&#13;
family household and the sociological, cultural, and behavioural factors&#13;
embeded in its operation.&#13;
This limitation is, slowly and gradually, being understood now; it&#13;
is becoming increasingly accepted that real knowledge of the peasant household&#13;
unit is crucial for designing economic and technical assistance capable of&#13;
real impact on the poorest groups. Therefore, the need for an interdis-&#13;
ciplinary approach is better recognized; an approach in which the sociologist/&#13;
anthropologist works jointly with the economist and the agricultural&#13;
researcher. This appears, to date, the most effective approach to under-&#13;
standing and affecting the peasant farming system, in the attempt to&#13;
accelerate development.&#13;
CIDER and PIDER would benefit immensely from steadfastly applying&#13;
this interdisciplinary approach and emphasizing more the sociological analysis&#13;
of the peasant household for both investment programming and evaluation.&#13;
The information basis should be expanded first. For the time being,&#13;
"before and after" profiles of family farms under the impact of PIDER invest-&#13;
ments cannot be made by CIDER because of the lack of pre-project (base-line)&#13;
information. These profiles can be prepared, however, in advance, for the&#13;
new microregions which will be covered by PIDER III. Household income&#13;
accounts, which are more complete and more relevant than conventional farm&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
income accounts, should be carefully devised and analyzed. CIDER should&#13;
explore how its own surveys on household income structure can best be coordi-&#13;
nated and corroborated with national statistical information, e.g. on income&#13;
distribution and household expenditures. Continuity of observation would&#13;
capture the interlinkages between production, marketing, credit, consumption,&#13;
seasonality, and on and off farm employment as they manifest themselves at the&#13;
level of the production and decision-making unit, much better than a single-&#13;
visit survey carried out at one point in time and asking the farmers about&#13;
almost everything.&#13;
Currently, there are several sectoral PIDER components which CIDER&#13;
has not yet approached in its evaluation work: extension, credit, marketing,&#13;
soil conservation, self-help and others. Although the rural poor place&#13;
great importance on social infrastructure, the existing evaluation methodology&#13;
is not able to capture these types of benefits. This points to the need for&#13;
CIDER to develop a methodology which can integrate and assess such benefits&#13;
alongside the more traditional benefits. A schedule of future sectoral&#13;
evaluation studies, with clearly specified topics should be introduced&#13;
into CIDER's work program.&#13;
Another complementary approach which CIDER could take for analyzing&#13;
the development impact of PIDER would be to undertake a set of special studies&#13;
on certain processes triggered or accelerated in the peasant sector by the&#13;
program's investments and by the forces currently at work within the Mexican&#13;
macroeconomy. For instance, such special studies can be carried out on the&#13;
transition process from subsistence to market oriented production, and its&#13;
consequences in the peasant economy as evidenced in certain PIDER microregions;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
a similar type of study could be undertaken on the process of combining&#13;
on-farm with off-farm employment, which appears to be an increasing trend in&#13;
campesino adaptive strategies. Focusing some special studies on socio-economic&#13;
processes and trends, as a complement to the sector-focused studies, might&#13;
enhance CIDER's grasp of the developmental impact and tendencies in the rural&#13;
sector.&#13;
The methodological refinement of field investigation for project&#13;
evaluation would enable CIDER to become more effective in its strategy recom-&#13;
mendations for rural development. CIDER's recommendations on policy, although&#13;
correct in their broad outlines, have been in the past rather general and&#13;
somewhat abstract, not substantiated by systematic evidence at the microlevel.&#13;
Subsequently, CIDER took on more direct empirical field studies. If it&#13;
continues to carry out these studies with analytical depth, it will thus build&#13;
up the insights and data base which could produce new strategy solutions of a&#13;
different, less general kind, ones which are more specific and better rooted&#13;
in the realities of the peasant economy and are of immediate operational&#13;
relevance.&#13;
The translation of evaluation findings into operational recommenda-&#13;
tions for PIDER actions have not always included concrete proposals for action&#13;
and for overcoming the immediate obstacles. This shortcoming ought to be&#13;
corrected in the future. CIDER's evaluation efforts are expected, in the&#13;
future, "to fulfill a truly replenishing function in the planning process" 1/&#13;
on the basis of its findings and of the specific solutions derived and pro-&#13;
posed.&#13;

January 31, 1979, p. 14.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
CIDER should also considerably expand its training activities for&#13;
PIDER staff in the future. Thus, it will be able to feed back the results&#13;
of its analytical efforts not only to the top PIDER management but also to&#13;
medium level and grassroot PIDER and agency staffs, through systematic train-&#13;
ing programs (see Annex II - "Training as a Feedback Channel for Evaluation&#13;
Findings").&#13;
Last but not least, the effectiveness of PIDER's entire monitoring&#13;
and evaluation system is also a function of the receptiveness of PIDER's&#13;
management staff, at both national and state levels. No monitoring and eval-&#13;
uation system can be strong and efficient if the information it feeds forward&#13;
into the daily management process and into the policy planning process is&#13;
disregarded. PIDER has developed, through a large scale effort, through&#13;
trial and error, a vast monitoring and evaluation network with considerable&#13;
experience and potential. In the final instance, it is up to PIDER management&#13;
to listen carefully and be more receptive to the system's critical signals, to&#13;
elicit new knowledge continuously, to ponder the lessons derived, and to use&#13;
and strengthen the M &amp; E systems as a uniquely powerful management tool.&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;
SUMMARY INFORMATON ON PIDER I AND PIDER II PROJECTS&#13;
PIDER (Programa de Invesiones para el Desarrollo Rural) was devel-&#13;
oped as a program to coordinate and focus the rural development efforts in&#13;
the most needy areas of Mexico, with a high concentration of rural poor.&#13;
Early in PIDER's development, in 1973, the Government of Mexico&#13;
requested the IBRD to support the PIDER program. A loan for US$110 million&#13;
was approved by the World Bank in May, 1975 to assist activities in 30 micro-&#13;
regions under the PIDER I Rural Development Project, of which the total cost&#13;
was $295 million. Investments in PIDER I are allocated to the following three&#13;
major activities:&#13;
(i)  Directly Productive Investments (66%), through the provision&#13;
of farm development credit (29.6%) for beef, dairy cattle&#13;
and other livestock purchases, rainfed grain farming, and&#13;
beekeeping, fruit production development (4.9%), improved&#13;
livestock production (10% for land clearing, fencing and&#13;
stock handling yards), irrigation development and rehabili-&#13;
tation (17%) and soil and water conservation (4.9%);&#13;
(ii)  Productive Support Investments (22%), through financing&#13;
improved extension services, market and store construction,&#13;
electrification and improved training. The Project is&#13;
also assisting in speeding up clearance of land titles to&#13;
newly established ejidos, and support technical services&#13;
including agricultural research at federal, state and&#13;
village levels.&#13;
(iii)  Social Infrastructure (12%), by the provision of improved&#13;
drinking water supplies, materials for self-help village&#13;
improvement projects, construction of primary schools and&#13;
limited rural health facilities.&#13;
After the first two years of implementing the PIDER I project, a&#13;
new World Bank credit of $120 million was granted to Mexico for the PIDER&#13;
program, under the PIDER II Rural Development Project. This extended World&#13;
Bank financial assistance to 50 PIDER microregions.&#13;
The scope of the PIDER II project generally follows the compass&#13;
of support given by PIDER I, with the addition of a rural industry component&#13;
(7% of productive investments).&#13;
Out of the total project cost of US$255 million about 70% finances&#13;
directly productive investments including farm development credit, (24%) irri-&#13;
gation (16%), livestock development (8%), soil and water conservation (5%),&#13;
and fruit, forestry, and fishery production (4%). The irrigation component&#13;
would develop about 34,000 ha of irrigated land and is expected to benefit&#13;
some 14,000 families, while the livestock investment would support livestock&#13;
development on some 500 ejidos.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Productive support activities, totalling about 20% of the PIDER II&#13;
project cost, have been included to reinforce improvements in agrarian reform&#13;
and farmer organization (3%) extension services, including field demonstra-&#13;
tions (about 5%), feeder roads (7%), rural electrification (3%), marketing&#13;
and store construction.&#13;
Another 10% of projects investments have been provided for social&#13;
infrastructure, including improved drinking water supplies, materials for&#13;
self-help village improvement projects, and primary schools construction.&#13;
In addition, PIDER II is lending support to CIDER evaluation activities, as&#13;
well as to field staff training carried out under CIDER auspicies.&#13;
PIDER's strategy guidelines for implementing these investments and&#13;
in achieving its poverty orientation objectives can be summarized as follows:&#13;
(a) The program should operate as a new institutionalized&#13;
mechanism (but not as yet another agency) which brings&#13;
the various public sector agencies that function in the&#13;
rural sector together in coordinated action.&#13;
(b) It should be implemented within a regional framework, so&#13;
as to concentrate its activities within a well-defined&#13;
radius, thereby promoting the development of regionally&#13;
integrated groups of communities, rather than the isolated&#13;
development of each individual community.&#13;
(c) Preference ought to be given to the poorest regions and&#13;
localities that possess potential resources, but lack pro-&#13;
ductive and support services and social infrastructures.&#13;
(d) The investments under the program should be assembled into&#13;
a medium-term regional development plan (which would apply&#13;
to both PIDER and non-PIDER activities) and into annual&#13;
plans for each region.&#13;
(e) The programs would comprise directly productive and support&#13;
works and services, and social infrastructure projects, with&#13;
the directly productive category receiving the largest share&#13;
of total financial resources.&#13;
(f) Village and ejido level participation in the planning and&#13;
execution process should be promoted.&#13;
(g) Planning and especially execution should be decentralized&#13;
to the state and local levels, integrating locally the&#13;
activities of existing line departments; specific alloca-&#13;
tions would be made to state levels from central government&#13;
funds, in order to finance approved programs.&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;
Organization and Management. Organizationally, PIDER deploys its&#13;
programming and coordinating functions at the federal, state and local levels.&#13;
Coordination is essential in the PIDER concept, since 14 agencies 1/ are&#13;
involved in the program.&#13;
At the federal level, PIDER's central management is located within&#13;
the Secretariat of Programming and Budgeting (SPP), in the Directorate of&#13;
Promotion and Regional Operations. Within this Directorate, a Sub-Directorate&#13;
or Rural Development (i.e., PIDER) is directly responsible for reviewing&#13;
investment plans, management operations, and investment monitoring.&#13;
At the state level, coordination of the program is handled by a&#13;
Coordinating Committee consisting of the state level directors of the par-&#13;
ticipating agencies, under the chairmanship of the state governor. Actual&#13;
management is the responsibility of the state level SPP representative who&#13;
is the technical secretary of the State Committee. The SPP representative is&#13;
assisted by a technical secretariat of professionals including a state level&#13;
PIDER coordinator and resident coordinators for each of the state's micro-&#13;
regions, who work closely with local elected officials and community leaders.&#13;
At the village/ejido level, local participation, essential to the&#13;
implementation of PIDER investments, is achieved through a variety of schemes&#13;
which depend on the political, social and administrative characteristics of&#13;
the sector and microregion. In some cases, such programs as feeder roads or&#13;
small irrigation works have served to launch permanent village committees,&#13;
which then undertake additional PIDER activities. As a rule, the field per-&#13;
sonnel of the Secretariat for Agrarian Reform takes the lead in organizing&#13;
communities at the outset involving municipal chiefs, ejido presidents,&#13;
teachers, or other appropriate persons, thus helping prepare the absorption&#13;
and implementation of PIDER investments.&#13;

ANNEX II&#13;
TRAINING AS A FEEDBACK CHANNEL FOR EVALUATION FINDINGS&#13;
CIDER's program for rural development training 1/ and its research&#13;
program 2/ for 1979 both emphasize training as an essential activity for&#13;
clarifying the design and planning of rural development actions among PIDER&#13;
staff and those of cooperating agencies.&#13;
From the outset, CIDER's mandate required the coupling of its&#13;
function of evaluating PIDER implementation with the function of training&#13;
PIDER's staff. It was considered that linking these two distinct activities&#13;
would provide a fast channel for feeding back the information collected on&#13;
PIDER's impact (or lack thereof) to the medium- and base-level PIDER staff&#13;
and would help educate the staff on the job with the lessons derived from&#13;
an analytical approach to the program's ongoing experience. CIDER set out&#13;
to fulfill its task, however, rather late, and for the initial period (until&#13;
1977) the training program was lagging behind schedule. Nor were the train-&#13;
ing manuals and documents prepared as initially planned. This was partly&#13;
due also to PIDER's vaguely defined policy for in-service staff training.&#13;
As a result, PIDER's very implementation process was adversely&#13;
affected. Among others, the insufficiency of training delayed the build&#13;
up of a unifying conceptual and methodological approach among the staff&#13;
involved in implementing the poverty-oriented strategy.&#13;
Only in 1977 did CIDER's training program start to become effective.&#13;
In conjunction with the agencies connected with planning and implementing the&#13;
PIDER program (viz., CECADE, SDR and SPP), CIDER organized two national and&#13;
13 state-level courses in 1977 for sharpening staff awareness at both levels.&#13;
The courses focused on four fundamental themes: (1) the issues of rural&#13;
development; (2) PIDER objectives and functions; (3) investment planning and&#13;
(4) project formulation and evaluation. Emphasis at central level seminars&#13;
was placed on the first two themes, while state level meetings concentrated&#13;
on the latter, more practice-oriented ones for application in the states con-&#13;
taining PIDER programs.&#13;
Course content in the central level meetings focused on identifying&#13;
the principal socio-economic factors determining the structure of the Mexican&#13;
rural environment, and in the state level seminars on the manipulation of&#13;
1/   CIDER, "Programa de Capacitacion para el Desarrollo Rural," 1977.&#13;
2/   Programma de Trabajo del CIDER:    1979, August 25, 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
ANNEX II&#13;
PIDER's methodology for planning, implementing, and modifying specific project&#13;
actions. 1/&#13;
Participation in each course was greater than expected: while goals&#13;
were set by CIDER to reach 520 state-level and 100 central level technicians,&#13;
575 and 117 in each group actually joined the training sessions. 2/&#13;
An evaluation questionnaire distributed by CIDER to participants&#13;
produced interesting assessments, indicating strong satisfaction with the&#13;
framing of rural development issues. The response to the seminars on planning&#13;
and implementation tools, while positive, was not as strong as the first&#13;
instance. 3/ Overall, however, 78% of participants expressed satisfaction&#13;
with seminar coordination, 20% called it adequate, and 2% found it lacking.&#13;
Because the seminars were by necessity given both before and after&#13;
the programming for FY78, different reactions to the materials were registered&#13;
from different staff groups. Those who participated after planning had begun&#13;
had assimilated more material than those reached beforehand. Some trainees&#13;
were only able to absorb a small portion of the extensive background materials,&#13;
a finding which calls for the tailoring of readings to the specific topics of&#13;
the training sessions (Ibid., p. 13). PIDER should henceforth plan to coor-&#13;
dinate its programming and CIDER training exercises better. Similarly, the&#13;
heterogeneity of the groups at the sessions impressed CIDER staff with the&#13;
need to attune the training exercise to the expertise of different groups&#13;
represented. Thus, while a small minority of participants found the materials&#13;
"elementary," those attending the sessions for the first time, particularly&#13;
SDR staff who made up 50% of total attendance, found the sessions "useful."&#13;
Different groups may have to be addressed in more specific ways in the future.&#13;
CIDER also recognized the need to include practical exercises in the sessions,&#13;
in order to achieve greater effectiveness of the training exercises.&#13;
1/   Background documents prepared for discussion of the four issues included&#13;
CIDER's "World Crisis and the Mexican Economy;" "Toward a Preliminary&#13;
Diagnostic of Mexican Agriculture;" and "Propositions for a Strategy&#13;
of Rural Development" for theme one. For the more operational themes,&#13;
three and four, CIDER prepared or circulated documents such as: "The&#13;
Technique of Global Planning," "Who are the Beneficiaries of Regional&#13;
Planning?" "Phases of the Budgetary Cycle," "Methodological Guidelines&#13;
for Investments Planning," "Patterns of Social Evaluation" and other&#13;
relevant materials.&#13;
2/   CIDER, "Programa de Capacitacion," Third Phase, p. 7.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
ANNEX II&#13;
Yet, CIDER itself needs to make better use of the training function&#13;
in feeding back project findings to different staff levels, particularly those&#13;
in the participating states. There is an exceptional potential in CIDER's&#13;
training role for implementing a large mass of development staff. The quality&#13;
of PIDER implementation depends on the heightened education of local and state&#13;
level PIDER staff, as well as staff of those dependencias or agencies entrusted&#13;
with project engineering.&#13;
Poverty orientation is a new and difficult strategy in rural develop-&#13;
ment and it takes re-education and re-training of staff for enabling them to&#13;
understand and implement this orientation effectively. CIDER did find that&#13;
the training exercise has contributed to "a better understanding of the inter-&#13;
institutional character of PIDER programming and the role that each institution&#13;
plays in the programming process". 1/ CIDER itself suggests the need-for&#13;
evaluating the post-training work performance of former trainees by state level&#13;
officials and throughout the agencies linked to PIDER programming. A more&#13;
concrete evaluation exercise might be developed as a regular feature of CIDER&#13;
operations. This exercise should also include reconsideration of the nature of&#13;
the training program in different years, assessing the adequacy of individual&#13;
courses versus the continuously changing nature of PIDER's activities.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
The following methodology guidelines are the fruit of the field&#13;
experience acquired over almost three years by the Programming Group of the&#13;
Research Center for Rural Development (CIDER) in Mexico. Unlike many other&#13;
papers on securing popular participation in the planning and design of rural&#13;
development projects, CIDER's "guidelines" are not a general ideological&#13;
advocation of the benefits of participation, lacking practical realism. On&#13;
the contrary, these Guidelines are an operationalized methodology explaining&#13;
the sequence of practical steps through which those who really want to do&#13;
bottom-up development planning should go. These Guidelines therefore leave&#13;
aside the glamour of the participation rhetoric in favor of dealing with the&#13;
nuts and bolts of participatory planning, even if the latter is somehow&#13;
prosaic in its administrative aspects.&#13;
The Guidelines, as they stand now, are not just a product of&#13;
imaginative planning, but the result of repeated actual testing and repeated&#13;
returns to the drawing board. CIDER's interest in investment programming&#13;
was mainly the result of their findings from several initial short-term&#13;
evaluations undertaken in several microregions. CIDER found that a major&#13;
problem in the PIDER Rural Development program was the poor quality of the&#13;
investment programs caused by inadequate determination of which investments&#13;
were most needed by the local communities. Thus, it was felt that an essen-&#13;
tial contribution CIDER could make to improve PIDER implementation was to&#13;
develop an improved programming methodology with a strong emphasis on involving&#13;
the local communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
The following methodology does not claim to be comprehensive and to&#13;
deal with all aspects of community participation in development. On the con-&#13;
trary, it is concerned with one - albeit crucial - segment of the cycle: the&#13;
participatory planning of development. This methodology is aimed at creating&#13;
the framework within which affected communities get the opportunity and the&#13;
incentives to become involved in solving the host of issues and tasks of which&#13;
the planning of development is composed: namely, the careful identification&#13;
of the existing but unused economic potential within these communities; the&#13;
assessment and comparison of alternative development options; the definition&#13;
of community felt needs; the choice and ranking of priorities; the allocation&#13;
of scarce resources among competing objectives; the scheduling of construction&#13;
work, etc.&#13;
Subsequent to the planning stage, there are, of course, many other&#13;
moments during the lengthy implementation process when community participation&#13;
ought to occur and to contribute to translating planning into action. For&#13;
assessing community participation in implementation stages, however, other&#13;
participatory mechanisms should be devised, including, for instance, labor&#13;
contributions, beneficiary cost-sharing, responsibility for maintenance, etc.&#13;
PIDER's experience with the latter aspects of participation, unfortunately, is&#13;
rather limited, and little has been done to build up participation in the post-&#13;
programming stages (as is indicated in the case study). Therefore, the follow-&#13;
ing summary of the PIDER participatory methodology does not discuss partici-&#13;
pation in the post-programming stages. But if participatory programming is&#13;
achieved at the beginning of the process, it can be expected that, in the long&#13;
run, better premises for community participation in later stages of the imple-&#13;
mentation cycle would be created.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 99 -&#13;
Repeated testing of the CIDER/PIDER programming procedure started in&#13;
the Mazahua region (Mexico State), using the methodology previously applied by&#13;
PIDER countrywide. Subsequently, in the regions of Tejupilco (Mexico State),&#13;
East Morelos, Ensenada (Northern Baja California) and Chol, Cintalapa, Zoque,&#13;
Lacandona and Bellavista (Chiapas), the CIDER Programming Group has carried&#13;
out testing on both the original programming and the annual program revisions.&#13;
In particular, CIDER has analyzed the strategy of the proposed investment&#13;
projects in relation to the communities' needs, priorities and available&#13;
resources.&#13;
On the basis of the above experience, the first Methodology Guide-&#13;
lines document was prepared. These guidelines were tested in practice in&#13;
1976, initially in the South and North Central (Southern Baja California)&#13;
micro-regions, and subsequently in the South Yucatan, Hecelchakan (Campeche&#13;
and South Nuevo Leon. The refinement of the methodology continued in the&#13;
West and East Morelos micro-regions in 1977*.&#13;
Despite extensive testing and continuous refinement of these guide-&#13;
lines, CIDER and PIDER do not regard them as the absolutely final word, not&#13;
needing further improvements. On the contrary, the imperative of continuous&#13;
adjustment and learning from experience is being stressed.&#13;
The Guidelines tend to combine flexibility with a well-structured&#13;
sequential approach to participatory planning. Participatory planning is not&#13;
*    In parallel with these experiments in Mexico, some elements of the&#13;
CIDER methodology have been applied and tested out in Columbia, in&#13;
the DRI (Integrated Rural Development) Program, during 1977 and 1978,&#13;
on the basis of a bilateral agreement between DRI and CIDER.&#13;
&#13;

- 100 -&#13;
regarded as simply collecting and collating community proposals, whatever they&#13;
might be or whoever may make them, with no regard for the sociology of the&#13;
given community, its power structure and actual economic potential. The&#13;
eliciting of the initiative of all strata in a given community should go hand&#13;
in hand with subsequent careful administrative and technical examination of&#13;
each proposal for the final integration into a development program.&#13;
The term "programming" as used in these Guidelines is the accepted&#13;
term in Mexico for "program design" or for "investment planning."&#13;
The methodology for participatory programming in PIDER emphasizes&#13;
a set of basic principles for eliciting such participation, which are probably&#13;
valid as general principles for different contexts. But the following Guide-&#13;
lines, as they stand, should not be regarded as directly transferable and&#13;
immediately applicable to all societies and cultures, They were worked out&#13;
for Mexico and reflect Mexican experience and institutional settings. Extra-&#13;
polation to other settings should imply adjustments, flexibility and adapta-&#13;
tion to local circumstances. The Guidelines' potential for generalization&#13;
resides, essentially, in their principles and major stages, not in their&#13;
details, For instance, flexible adjustment of this methodology to various&#13;
local circumstances should not skip over any of the crucial stages of the&#13;
process, but should make changes, innovations and adaptations of the specific&#13;
procedures for contracting, consulting and involving these communities, accord-&#13;
ing to local traditions, customs, institutional structures and values. In&#13;
turn, these very institutional structures and procedures would be required&#13;
to change, to a smaller or larger extent, if genuine participation in planning&#13;
is to be implemented. It should be clearly remembered that the participatory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
approach can be introduced gradually provided other transformations in the&#13;
sectoral or national institutional levels create a propitious framework for&#13;
promoting participation.&#13;
The methodological guidelines for participatory programming,&#13;
as designed by CIDER, are summarized below. Dr. Jorge Echenique, who as&#13;
Deputy Director of CIDER, and Lic. Marcos Arellano, as head of CIDER's&#13;
Programming Group, contributed essentially to the preparation of these&#13;
Guidelines, assisted in selecting the main elements of this methodology&#13;
from a significantly larger description (available as a distinct document&#13;
from CIDER*), and in preparing the following summary. Their help is grate-&#13;
fully acknowledged.&#13;

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR PARTICIPATORY PROGRAMMING&#13;
Programming rural development investments and activities is an&#13;
exercise whose content is determined by the objectives in view and the&#13;
developmental strategy adopted for accomplishing them.&#13;
The direction taken by the rural development process that PIDER&#13;
seeks to promote is imparted by the objectives of that process. The Program's&#13;
overall strategy is the instrument through which those objectives are to be&#13;
accomplished. The objectives and strategy are not fixed immutably; they are&#13;
continuously reviewed as field experience is turned to account.&#13;
It is therefore necessary, first, to understand the Program's&#13;
objectives and strategy at the present time, so that the reasons for the&#13;
steps recommended in the methodological guidelines can be understood. (A&#13;
brief presentation of the PIDER objectives and strategy is made in Section II&#13;
of the main paper.)&#13;
The basic principles by which programming of the PIDER regions&#13;
must be guided can be summarized under six headings:&#13;
1.1 Participation by_the peasant population&#13;
The individual activities of which each regional program is composed&#13;
must derive from proposals put forward by the peasant populations of the&#13;
communities that make up the region. The particular development strategy for&#13;
a given region must stem from the image the peasant farmers have of their own&#13;
needs and development possibilities.&#13;
This principle is crucial. Development cannot be planned on the&#13;
basis solely of studies or ideas put forward by technical or economic agencies&#13;
or by PIDER's own staff, To do so would be to impose a future perspective on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
the communities that would conflict with the way its members see their own&#13;
future or, even in the best of cases, to accept that the officials have a&#13;
more complete perception of peasant farmers' problems, needs and capabilities&#13;
than they themselves have.&#13;
The proposed guidelines do not accept the role of officials as&#13;
interpreters of the peasant-farmers' interests. They recognize that it is a&#13;
prerequisite of programming that the development plan contains and reflects&#13;
what the members of each community have directly asked as needed support from&#13;
the appropriate agencies.&#13;
It is possible, and even likely, that one or another of the specific&#13;
instruments that these guidelines propose for securing the participation of&#13;
the peasant population will prove inadequate. Therefore, in certain specific&#13;
situations, which vary so much from each other, those responsible for the&#13;
programming will always have to adjust procedures to local structural and&#13;
cultural circumstances and to discover new ways of making peasant partici-&#13;
pation dynamic and effective.&#13;
1.2 Community diagnoses&#13;
The principle of community participation requires that a diagnoses&#13;
of each community be undertaken and that it be continuous or at least extend&#13;
over a long period.&#13;
It would be a misinterpretation of the concept of community parti-&#13;
cipation to believe that this can be achieved simply by listening to a few&#13;
community leaders or accepting the first investment ideas that the community&#13;
spontaneously puts forward. Community participation calls for information and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
organization, for a commitment by the whole of the peasant population; it&#13;
calls for reflection, for a knowledge of available resources and of development&#13;
possibilities, conscious priority-ranking of needs, sequential ordering of the&#13;
works and services that will be required of the program; it calls for time --&#13;
time to promote, develop and harvest this collective thinking; and it calls&#13;
for technicians capable of participating in this exercise without imposing&#13;
their own ideas, without thinking they know everything and without having any&#13;
axe to grind.&#13;
1.3 Stages in programming&#13;
Programming has been defined as a process of iterative approxi-&#13;
mation.&#13;
The first approximation is achieved within the local community,&#13;
when the investment proposals of the peasant population are first obtained.&#13;
The preliminary projects and later the final projects developed from these&#13;
proposals go into deeper detail with regard to the technical, economic and&#13;
social feasibility of each of the activities it is proposed to carry out.&#13;
This feasibility study will be the responsibility of the institutions.&#13;
Preliminary programming brings the various preliminary projects&#13;
together and ensures that they are mutually complementary, ranks them in&#13;
order of importance, adjusts them to the expected availability of funds,&#13;
and establishes their chronological sequence of execution.&#13;
Final programming ensures that the projects form a coherent whole,&#13;
completes the refinement of the steps taken in preliminary programming, and&#13;
sets the final dimensions of the activities to be undertaken in light of the&#13;
budget funds approved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.4 The community and the region&#13;
The development subject is the rural community, but the community&#13;
considered not as a separate entity but in relation to the larger society of&#13;
which it forms a part.&#13;
The purpose of the exercise is to formulate an integral development&#13;
program for each of the rural communities that belong to the region. But&#13;
programming does not stop there: it is not simply the arithmetical sum&#13;
of the programs of the individual communities but rather the expression of&#13;
a strategy for the development of a set of communities. In other words,&#13;
participatory programming should reconcile the overall strategy with local,&#13;
individual priorities. There are several sociological and economic reasons&#13;
for this integrating approach:&#13;
- In the PIDER micro-regions there are systems composed of&#13;
communities that are linked to the same development center,&#13;
have similar ecologies and natural resources and similar&#13;
socio-economic production structures. They share a common&#13;
communications network and common cultural roots. It is&#13;
obviously essential in these cases to try to formulate a&#13;
strategy for the integral development of the entire system.&#13;
-  Certain works and services will necessarily have to cover a&#13;
number of neighboring localities. Examples are agroindustries&#13;
(which because of their scale need to procure their raw&#13;
materials from a number of communities), roads linking several&#13;
population centers, and irrigation and water-supply systems.&#13;
-  Peasant organization is an integrating process which finds&#13;
its initial expression in the communities but must build up&#13;
to higher levels (region, state, country). This is true not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
only of administrative or political forms of social organiza-&#13;
tion but also of producer organizations. For example, the&#13;
Uniones de Eiidos (Commonland Farmers' Unions) conduct&#13;
integrationist activities at the regional level in connection&#13;
with marketing, credit, agricultural machinery and so on.&#13;
One objective of programming is therefore to identify the possibili-&#13;
ties for integrating sets of communities within the region, and this continues&#13;
to be a fundamentally important task of the peasant organizations. They can-&#13;
*not be replaced in this task by officials, though the latter have an important&#13;
role to perform in promoting it.&#13;
1.5 Inter-agency cooperation&#13;
The programming exercise is a task shared among the responsible&#13;
officials of the PIDER central team, the PIDER state teams and the partici-&#13;
pating agencies.&#13;
The responsible officials at the national level provide advisory&#13;
assistance on programming, act as a clearing house for experiences in the&#13;
regions, set the financial parameters, and approve the final programs for&#13;
each region, interpolating them into the national program.&#13;
The state teams direct the entire programming exercise, coordinate&#13;
the various stages and activities, integrate the agencies in the different&#13;
work stages, ensuring that their work is mutually complementary, and propose&#13;
the final programs.&#13;
The agencies contribute their experience and their studies and&#13;
diagnoses, take part in the field researches, express their views on the&#13;
development strategy, and prepare the preliminary and final projects within&#13;
their specific areas-of competence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107 -&#13;
1.6 The pursuit of the ultimate objectives&#13;
The objectives of the Program must be kept in mind throughout&#13;
the programming process so as to ensure that the selection of the regions,&#13;
of the target localities within each region and of the beneficiaries of the&#13;
Program within each locality is conducive to their accomplishment. This means&#13;
that the decisions about what to do, where to do it and who the beneficiaries&#13;
should be, must be guided by the true possibilities of increasing production,&#13;
employment and incomes while at the same time, and just as importantly,&#13;
ensuring that the recipients of these benefits are the peasant groups that are&#13;
relatively most backward in terms of resources and development possibilities.&#13;
II. STAGES IN PROGRAMMING&#13;
This methodology provides for three consecutive and continuous&#13;
programming stages, each consisting of specific and well-defined activities&#13;
and using specific working criteria and instruments. 1/&#13;
The first stage, Diagnosis, comprises analysis of the existing&#13;
infrastructure and resources and of the strategy developed in previous years.&#13;
It includes a study of the localities where investment proposals will be&#13;
obtained directly from the rural population.&#13;
In the second stage, Preliminary Programming, the information&#13;
compiled in the Diagnosis stage is analyzed and then organized into community-&#13;
level strategies and investment ideas. From this material the agencies will&#13;
prepare the preliminary investment projects and propose the productive,&#13;
social and support subprograms.&#13;
1/   These instruments are available in CIDER.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
In the last stage, Final Programming, the final projects are&#13;
prepared; they are then ranked and organized into a budget program which has&#13;
to be submitted to the central-government authorities for final negotiation.&#13;
When approved, the program has to be disseminated at various levels.&#13;
2.1 STAGE ONE: DIAGNOSIS&#13;
This stage begins with the compiling and processing of the data&#13;
on the region and ends with designing, in a participatory way, the strategy&#13;
for the program (see the Activities Flow Chart in Appendix 1). The purposes&#13;
of the diagnosis are as follows:&#13;
- To obtain general background information on the region and&#13;
its component municipalities with respect to population,&#13;
natural resources, ecology, and tenure, productive&#13;
activities and employment, i.e. to identify the region's&#13;
overall development potential and constraints.&#13;
- To analyze the present geographic conformation of the region&#13;
and decide whether to enlarge it, reduce it, or retain it&#13;
unchanged for planning purposes.&#13;
- To define the universe of action of the program, comprising&#13;
the localities potentially eligible for PIDER investments.&#13;
- To identify virgin or underutilized resources, objective&#13;
needs for services, and the investment priorities perceived&#13;
by the rural population in each of the localities that poten-&#13;
tially qualify for the benefits of the Program.&#13;
- To obtain information about the existing rural infrastructure&#13;
and how it works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
- To assess the strategy followed by PIDER in previous years and&#13;
the progress made to date in each of its component programs.&#13;
The diagnosis stage would bring together the planners and the com-&#13;
munities in a reciprocal information effort to identify existing potentials&#13;
and needs and to cooperate for defining the development priorities and&#13;
approaches. The diagnosis stage includes the study of target localities, and&#13;
during this study the planners are expected both to learn from the local&#13;
population and to inform it about the preliminary assessments they make. The&#13;
willingness and preparedness of the community to participate in the imple-&#13;
mentation of various projects (for instance, through labor, cash, or other&#13;
contributions) could also be assessed, on a preliminary basis, during the&#13;
village diagnosis. Informing and educating the local population is essential&#13;
for triggering genuine participation in programming, since it is only when the&#13;
affected communities possess the information on the available span of develop-&#13;
ment options that they may exercise an informed choice.&#13;
2.1.1     Compilation and processing of secondary data.&#13;
The data have to be obtained at the central and stage levels simul-&#13;
taneously. The main sources will be the Population Censuses and the Farming,&#13;
Stockraising and Ejidal (Commonland) Census, the investment programs autho-&#13;
rized by PIDER in previous years, the existing cartographic studies, and the&#13;
monographs and studies of the region produced by official, academic and&#13;
private institutions.&#13;
2.1.2     Analysis of the region.&#13;
The purpose of this analysis is to review (a) the present confor-&#13;
mation of the regions and. (b) define the universe of localities potentially&#13;
eligible for the PIDER Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
(a)   Conformation of the region.   A first approximation of the boundaries&#13;
of the region is obtained from the municipal-development index, which ranks&#13;
the municipalities within and adjacent to the region. 1/ However, the basic&#13;
source will be the experience of PIDER's own field staff, which can apply&#13;
the following criteria in recommending that the present region be enlarged,&#13;
reduced or retained unchanged:&#13;
- Number of PIDER-eligible localities in relation to total rural&#13;
population.&#13;
- Degree of geographic and ecological homogeneity; such (relative)&#13;
homogeneity facilitates dovetailing of program activities and&#13;
may minimize implementation costs *.&#13;
- Potential in terms of utilizable resources, as an indicator&#13;
of development possibilities in relation to those of the other&#13;
municipalities and of the region as a whole.&#13;
- Existing rural infrastructure, taking into account the degree to&#13;
which this infrastructure is articulated within the municipality,&#13;
with the rest of the region and with the rest of the state, and&#13;
the existing level of services.&#13;
These criteria must be considered in conjunctively, duly weighted&#13;
to reflect their relative importance in the light of the support group's&#13;
knowledge of the region.&#13;
1/   A municipal-development index which incorporates 16 economic variables&#13;
is available and covers all municipalities in Mexico.&#13;
*)   Ecological homogeneity may also facilitate the selection of agricultural&#13;
packages for a region, but is not necessarily an indispensable criterion&#13;
for defining a region. Under certain circumstances, the complementarity&#13;
between different ecological zones that exist in close proximity and the&#13;
opportunities for local trading may give more incentive for development&#13;
than ecological uniformity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ill -&#13;
(b) Universe of potential PIDER localities. When determining the&#13;
conformation of the region it will be necessary also to determine the number&#13;
of localities potentially eligible for the PIDER Program that will have to&#13;
be served over the entire programming period. The following procedure is&#13;
suggested for this:&#13;
- A study is conducted of localities which, according to the last&#13;
census, have a population in the 300-3,000 range. If the aggre-&#13;
gate rural population in these localities is less than 50% of the&#13;
total rural population of the region, the lower limit of 300&#13;
inhabitants for eligible localities will be reduced.&#13;
- The lower limit per locality will be reduced to a figure such that&#13;
the localities which become eligible have an aggregate population&#13;
exceeding 50% of the total rural population of the region.&#13;
- In the case of ejidos or communities divided into a number of&#13;
different localities, all of the localities must be included --&#13;
even those with a population below the lower limit.&#13;
2.1.3     Discussion with the agencies&#13;
Discussions will be held both with the agencies that have parti-&#13;
cipated in the PIDER Program in the past and those that couild participate in&#13;
it or could at least contribute information and investment proposals (banks,&#13;
FIRA, regional development agencies).&#13;
The discussions can be conducted with groups of agencies. The&#13;
groups can consist of agencies performing similar or complementary functions.&#13;
The groupings will be flexible, depending on the characteristics of each&#13;
agency and on the importance of the role played by the corresponding sub-&#13;
programs in previous PIDER years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
The following points shall always be studied with these groups:&#13;
- Analysis of the programming methodology used in the past.&#13;
- Role of the agencies in programming in the past.&#13;
- Analysis of the strategy followed in previous years,&#13;
particularly with respect to:&#13;
- The main problems of the region, depending on the sphere&#13;
of competence of each agency;&#13;
- The solutions adopted for these problems by the agencies&#13;
through PIDER and conventional programs.&#13;
- Coordination between institutions, and complementarity of&#13;
the subprograms of each agency.&#13;
The object of this work will be to commit the institutions in the&#13;
programming process, to review together their past experience with PIDER, and&#13;
develop new methodologies for the future.&#13;
2.1.4     The Study of Localities&#13;
It is during this core phase of programming that the peasant&#13;
population begins to play its crucial role.&#13;
The way in which the study of localities is carried out will largely&#13;
determine the programming and subsequent execution of the Program in the&#13;
region. The principle that governs this phase of the work is that the Program&#13;
must spring from the localities and more specifically from the investment&#13;
proposals put forward by the peasant population.&#13;
The work at the locality level has the following specific and&#13;
simultaneous objectives:&#13;
a) To ascertain how the existing general infrastructure and tech-&#13;
nologies work and what results they produce.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
This point meets the need to identify investment proposals that&#13;
can increase efficiency or lengthen the useful life of the investments already&#13;
made in the local infrastructure. It is important also to identify investments&#13;
required to supplement projects that for some reason have not been completed&#13;
or which, though apparently completed, have not been taken into service. It&#13;
will be sought also to feed back the experience with project design, execution&#13;
and supervision into the new programming sequence.&#13;
b) To ascertain the available potential resources.&#13;
The purpose is to determine the degree to which the physical and&#13;
human resources are utilized and to provide the material basis for the strat-&#13;
egy of the Program.&#13;
c) To encourage and collect duly justified investment proposals.&#13;
These proposals must derive directly from the peasant population&#13;
and will have to be checked by the field team for initial appraisal of their&#13;
technical feasibility. The field team, in turn, is in a position to inform&#13;
the community about its preliminary assessment and may point out development&#13;
opportunities which the traditional community might have overlooked.&#13;
The investment proposals obtained in the localities will furnish&#13;
the material for the preliminary project stage; they must therefore be fully&#13;
supported by justifying data.&#13;
How to undertake the study of a locality?&#13;
One way of securing the participation of the peasant population&#13;
is to hold meetings attended by ejidatarios (commonland farmers) and other&#13;
members of the local communities. Such meetings have succeeded in getting&#13;
various local individuals and social groups to participate by suggesting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -&#13;
investment proposals, priority-ranking them according to the needs perceived&#13;
by the population, providing information, and so on. The holding of meetings&#13;
for programming purposes is thus an important step forward and such meetings&#13;
have become an indispensable instrument.&#13;
However, to ensure that the meeting as such provides a suitable&#13;
forum in this stage of the study and reflects the real interests of the&#13;
locality, it is necessary to grasp and explore the relationships that exist&#13;
between the various social groups within the locality, particularly between&#13;
the poor peasants and those who are better off.&#13;
A sociological understanding of the village community stratification&#13;
is necessary. Not all of the groups express their concerns with equal force-&#13;
fulness, and relatively few express them distinctly. Fear of speaking up and&#13;
the limited participation by women and young people and by groups tradi-&#13;
tionally neglected by investment policies (such as landless laborers or the&#13;
smallest farmers) are serious constraints. Certain cultural patterns often&#13;
tend to prevent women from expressing their views on community development&#13;
needs, despite their multiple roles in the peasant household organization and&#13;
in the peasant economy. The traditional authority and power structure of the&#13;
village community may tend to control the contacts between the field team and&#13;
certain village groups or individuals.&#13;
The sensitivity of the interdisciplinary field team engaged in the&#13;
community diagnosis to the concerns of the villagers, particularly of the&#13;
most deprived groups, is essential. The field team should not only announce&#13;
the purposes of program preparation to the village population at large, but&#13;
also talk to small groups, have individual contacts and informants, and create&#13;
propitious conditions for various village subgroups to express their interests&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
and needs. The field team, if well oriented, may turn the community diagnosis&#13;
into an extremely valuable information and education exercise for the&#13;
community, making the villagers more aware of their own needs, potentials and&#13;
rights to shape their development programs.&#13;
A summary is given in the following chart (see p. 116) of activities&#13;
to be performed by a field team, consisting basically of agricultural-extension&#13;
agents, in carrying out the locality study.&#13;

2.1.5     Programming Procedures&#13;
Analysis and priority-ranking of the proposals. It is necessary&#13;
next, on the basis of all the information collected during the previous&#13;
steps, to carry out an analysis of the region as a whole in order to&#13;
determine the action to be applied to the localities over the programming&#13;
time-period.&#13;
First of all, the investment proposals derived from each of the&#13;
localities must be analyzed and then ranked, using the following criteria:&#13;
- The degree to which implementation of the investment proposal&#13;
is likely to solve the locality's more important problems;&#13;
the main basis for this is the ranking performed by the con-&#13;
cerned community itself.&#13;
- The quality of the information obtained in support of the&#13;
investment proposal (this factor is of prime importance).&#13;
-  The degree to which the proposal complements others in the&#13;
same locality or in other localities.&#13;
-  The economic benefits that implementation of the proposal will&#13;
yield, particularly in terms of employment, income distribution&#13;
and surplus production, compared with the cost-benefit analysis&#13;
of possible alternative investment proposals.&#13;
The analysis of investment proposals put forward by local communities&#13;
requires economic, technical and social analysis. The attention given to&#13;
social criteria should not obscure the need for sound economic criteria and&#13;
for usig formalized techniques for measuring costs and benefits, distribu-&#13;
tional consequences, etc. An expert economic analysis is in the best interest&#13;
of the communities themselves and is an integral part of the planners' contri-&#13;
bution to the process of participatory programming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
Subdivision of the region. Since the initial programming period has&#13;
been set at four years *), that will necessarily also be the duration of the&#13;
first phase of the Program in the region. It may be desirable to subdivide&#13;
the region for that time period when:&#13;
- The size of the region causes problems in programming and&#13;
in execution, supervision and control of the program;&#13;
-  The potential localities are very numerous or very scattered and to&#13;
meet all the needs arising would be to over-dilute the investment;&#13;
- Some localities have a very different development level from the&#13;
others and need special treatment. Thus, the region may contain&#13;
areas where the lack of access roads and minimum infrastructure is&#13;
so serious as to hinder the launching of productive activities, so&#13;
that the first action must be to correct these deficiencies.&#13;
Division into subregions will consist in defining the portions&#13;
of the region that will be excluded from the Program, those which will have&#13;
to receive priority attention and those that can be incorporated into the&#13;
Program later.&#13;
Basically, three types of areas can be excluded from the Program in&#13;
the first period, in order to avoid spreading scarce investment resources too&#13;
thinly: (a) groups of localities that already possess infrastructure, ade-&#13;
quate resources and/or support from conventional programs to be able to&#13;
develop independently, without the help of the Program; (b) subregions con-&#13;
sisting of scattered population centers, lacking or with only very poor&#13;
potential resources; and (c) areas whose basic activity is not farming and&#13;
that do not have a mainly peasant population.&#13;
*    This is only a first time slice of a much longer developmental program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
The purpose of division into subregions is to make the best possible&#13;
use of the limited resources available to the Program, in the light of local&#13;
conditions, by attending to the priority-ranked localities in the first&#13;
stage of programming and incorporating the others in later stages. 3/&#13;
It is desirable to avoid dispersion of the investments under the&#13;
program, i.e. to concentrate the investments in fewer localities. This makes&#13;
it possible to attend to the investment needs or investment proposals as a&#13;
whole instead of carrying out a series of disconnected activities without any&#13;
evident impact. Another aim of division into sub-regions is to facilitate&#13;
coordination and improve administration, supervision and control.&#13;
The following factors are taken into account in deciding the com-&#13;
position of the subregions: Homogeneity in terms of potentially exploitable&#13;
resources; Degree of infrastructure needs; Number of potential localities and&#13;
their dispersion and communications.&#13;
A given subregion will merit priority for attention in the first&#13;
stage of programming if:&#13;
(a) The peasant populations of its component localities&#13;
express a relatively stronger interest in the Program.&#13;
(b) Investments previously made in the subregion call for&#13;
further investments so that they may be completed,&#13;
supplemented or brought into service.&#13;
(c) The subregion possesses relatively large resources for the&#13;
implementation of productive projects.&#13;
3/   The actual stages should not be standardized; they should be defined&#13;
in light of conditions and opportunities existing in each region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
In some regions, where the conditions described above are not&#13;
present, there will be no need for subdivision. In later, subsequent periods,&#13;
however, it will always be necessary to give attention to all the essential&#13;
needs of other localities in the region as well.&#13;
Selection of Localities. The first step in selecting the localities&#13;
to be incorporated into the Program each year is the distinguish the various&#13;
categories of localities present in the region as the basis for determining&#13;
the working sequence of the Program.&#13;
In summary, a priority subregion may contain localities that possess&#13;
some infrastructure, providing the starting point for productive investments,&#13;
and also other localities which need first to be provided with certain works&#13;
and services so that productive-investment programs can be implemented later.&#13;
It may contain localities in which the agencies have accomplished a great deal&#13;
in the form of works and services projects and which, therefore, either do not&#13;
qualify for inclusion in the program or qualify only with respect to projects&#13;
complementing certain investments or support services. Some localities may be&#13;
so widely dispersed and lacking in resources that they do not qualify for the&#13;
first phase Program because even if they were provided with infrastructure the&#13;
investment impact would be minimal or even nil.&#13;
Finally, there will be localities which possess exploitable resources&#13;
but require large investments before they can turn them to account (which&#13;
reduces the potential impact of the Program) or localities whose development&#13;
is ensured by other, non-PIDER governmental projects.&#13;
Because of this wide diversity of possible situations of the&#13;
localities, it is advisable to rank the activities and localities that will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
brought into the Program each year, within the subregion(s) being considered&#13;
for the first stage, in order of priority. A priority listing should also be&#13;
made of localities which, though they qualify for PIDER in terms of size and&#13;
are located within a priority subregion, are to be excluded from the Program&#13;
or to be included in it only with respect to support services.&#13;
2.1.6     Diagnosis and strategy document&#13;
The final phase of the diagnosis stage will comprise the preparation&#13;
of a strategy report; this will provide the frame of reference for the activi-&#13;
ties to be carried out by each of the institutions participating in the pro-&#13;
gramming. Its content will be as follows:&#13;
A.   Diagnosis&#13;
a. Evaluation of the strategy applied in the region&#13;
with respect to:&#13;
- Characteristics of the main productive&#13;
projects in progress;&#13;
- Complementarity between productive, support&#13;
and social projects;&#13;
- Consistency between productive resources, needs&#13;
of the region and application of the budget.&#13;
b. Identification of principal resources and problems&#13;
of the region:&#13;
- Division into subregions; component localities;&#13;
- Productive resources, infrastructure and&#13;
services (by subregion);&#13;
- Principal problems (by subregion).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -&#13;
B.   Objectives and strategy&#13;
a. Objectives.&#13;
b. Strategy for the specific region:&#13;
- Programming stages, and criteria for priority-&#13;
ranking of subregions and localities.&#13;
- Main investment projects, their justifica-&#13;
tion and their execution sequence.&#13;
C.   Investment proposals&#13;
a. Names of the localities proposed for each stage.&#13;
b. Investment proposals deriving from the study of all&#13;
the localities.&#13;
c. Request for preliminary projects for the localities&#13;
included in the programming for next year.&#13;
This report is to be the instrument for the preliminary decision&#13;
making on the projects; the information under the above headings must there-&#13;
fore be very precise.&#13;
A copy of the report will later be supplied to each of the agencies&#13;
that participate in the programming.&#13;
2.1.7     Analysis of the investment proposals with the agencies&#13;
Before analysis of the investment proposals obtained from the&#13;
peasant population begins, they have to be discussed in detail with the&#13;
technical agencies as well. This will be based on the document drawn up&#13;
for the purpose, indicating the division of the region into subregions, the&#13;
localities selected and the programming stages.&#13;
The analysis of these proposals with the agencies will consist of&#13;
discussion of the technical feasibility and socio-economic implications of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
each proposal in the light of the justifying data supplied by the field team&#13;
and for the agencies, and PIDER's knowledge of the locality.&#13;
Participatory programming, in particular the discussion of invest-&#13;
ment proposals with both local communities and technical agencies, may cause&#13;
a certain lengthening of the planning process and has usually to accommodate&#13;
a number of divergent views. There is, however, a trade-off, in the sense&#13;
that participatory programming, as opposed to "ivory tower" programming, has&#13;
a better chance to avoid the adoption of inadequate solutions (or of solutions&#13;
not desired by the local communities) and may also speed up the subsequent&#13;
implementation process considerably. When scheduling participatory pro-&#13;
gramming, an appropriate time horizon should be provided to allow for this&#13;
necessary lengthening of the process.&#13;
The analysis of the investment proposals with the technical agencies&#13;
may result in eliminating some of the least feasible or least beneficial pro-&#13;
posals. Information on this process should be communicated to, explained and&#13;
discussed with members of grassroot communities, to reach a broad agreement&#13;
within the communities on how their needs and aspiration should be satisfied&#13;
by the program.&#13;
2.2       STAGE TWO:  PRELIMINARY PROGRAMMING&#13;
2.2.1     Seminar&#13;
The purposes of this seminar are to ensure uniformity of criteria&#13;
among the officials of the different agencies for preliminary and final&#13;
project preparation and also to contrast preliminary and final projects in&#13;
terms of degree of detail of their component aspects and to explain the&#13;
internal cohesion that is required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
The seminar will also deal with the salient features common to&#13;
preliminary and final projects, i.e.: Location and size; Basic engineering&#13;
aspects; Budgets; Appraisal; Constraints, by type of project. 4/&#13;
2.2.2     Preparation of preliminary projects&#13;
The purpose of the iterative-approximation procedure in project&#13;
preparation (which begins by exploring the community's investment proposal)&#13;
is to make increasingly certain of the technical, economic and social feasi-&#13;
bility of each activity under the Program.&#13;
The preparation of preliminary projects constitutes the second&#13;
stage of approximation in the feasibility study.&#13;
This phase of the work is the direct responsibility of the institu-&#13;
tions, working in coordination with PIDER. The time required for delivery&#13;
of a preliminary project by the institutions will be approximately one month&#13;
following the request.&#13;
2.2.3     Analysis of preliminary projects&#13;
The analysis will be carried out jointly by PIDER and the agencies&#13;
for each of the preliminary projects submitted, using the following criteria:&#13;
a.  Internal cohesion of the preliminary project:&#13;
This is the required congruence between the components of the study&#13;
(e.g. consistency of installed capacity with raw-materials avail-&#13;
ability and with potential market).&#13;
4/   CIDER possesses project preparation guidelines for each project category&#13;
(irrigation, livestock development, roads, water supply, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -&#13;
b. Estimated benefits of the preliminary projects:&#13;
The direct benefits relate to the number of peasant families that&#13;
will benefit from the preliminary project and the production,&#13;
employment and income increases it is expected to generate, and&#13;
also to the social groups that will benefit within each locality&#13;
and the position they occupy in the local system of social strati-&#13;
fication.&#13;
c.  Unit-investment parameters of PIDER:&#13;
These parameters are maximum investment coefficients (per-family,&#13;
per-hectare, etc.) which will have to be adhered to for each project&#13;
category covered by a PIDER determination.&#13;
Where necessary, the data furnished by the preliminary project will&#13;
be checked in the field.&#13;
2.2.4     Preliminary program for the region&#13;
This phase begins with the preparation of subprograms by the tech-&#13;
nical agencies, grouping together preliminary projects off the same nature.&#13;
The main criteria for inclusion of the projects into the preliminary program&#13;
will be: (1) Relatively advanced degree of detail in the preparation studies;&#13;
(2) Complementarity between preliminary projects; (3) Relatively low invest-&#13;
ment per beneficiary; (4) Relatively lower investment per man employed;&#13;
(5) Relatively greater impact on production per unit of investment.&#13;
In consolidating the preliminary program it will be necessary to&#13;
bear in mind the probable budgetary constraint. The following criterion will&#13;
be used. Assuming that the approved budget is known up to the beginning of&#13;
the following year, the figure to be taken will be the amount authorized in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
the current year plus 50% (at constant prices). If the budget is lower than&#13;
authorized, a reserve of projects will be available for future reprogramming&#13;
exercises.&#13;
The preliminary program will have to establish which preliminary&#13;
projects can be considered as final for purposes of preparation of the final&#13;
program, which ones will be included in the next annual program for their&#13;
study phase but not yet for execution phase, and which ones will not be&#13;
included in the final phase of the program at all.&#13;
2.3 FINAL PROGRAMMING&#13;
The main purpose of this stage is to move to a higher level of&#13;
consolidation through the formulation and analysis of specific projects.&#13;
This stage begins with the request to the technical agencies for finalizing&#13;
specific projects on the basis of the comments made on each preliminary&#13;
project.&#13;
2.3.1     Analysis of the project&#13;
Project review is an interdisciplinary task involving PIDER and&#13;
the persons who prepared the studies. The project-analysis criteria are&#13;
similar to those for the preliminary projects.&#13;
Some productive projects (fruitgrowing, agroindustries, etc.),&#13;
which require working-capital financing, need to be presented in a way that&#13;
facilitates their technical appraisal by the Banks. The object is to tie&#13;
the proposed fixed investment in with the analysis criteria used by the&#13;
most suitable source of financing supplemental to PIDER.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
2.3.2     Composition of the final program for the region&#13;
The Program must form a coherent whole, in the sense that its&#13;
component parts fit together and are consistent internally and as a whole&#13;
with the strategy adopted to accomplish the rural development objectives&#13;
for the region; it must be sequential, since it extends over a time period&#13;
of four years; 5/ and it must be technically and economically feasible, so&#13;
as to ensure that its goals will be attained.&#13;
The following sequence is suggested for presentation of the final&#13;
program:&#13;
(1) Strategy and objectives.&#13;
(2) Programs (this section will include a summary of each&#13;
subprogram): productive programs; support programs;&#13;
social programs.&#13;
(3) Consolidated program budgets.&#13;
(4) Appraisal.&#13;
2.3.3     Appraisal of the program&#13;
The appraisal criteria to be used derive from the general objec-&#13;
tives of PIDER and the particular objectives of the specific program. They&#13;
take into consideration, in particular, the increases generated in levels of&#13;
production, income and employment.&#13;
A financial appraisal will be carried out in addition, using the&#13;
cash-flow discounting method. The basic indicators that this method uses&#13;
are cost/benefit ratio and internal rate of return.&#13;
5/   Although the projects will make reference to the first programming year,&#13;
they will have to take into account the need for complementarity and&#13;
continuity with projects in future years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
The discounting rate used will be that prevailing on the financial&#13;
market at the time of appraisal. The cost and benefit flows will be cal-&#13;
culated for a 25-year period.&#13;
2.3.4     Negotiation of the program&#13;
The integrated program will be submitted to the Rural Development&#13;
Division (Subdireccion de Desarrollo Rural) to note the financial needs of&#13;
the program and the factors that justify it.&#13;
After the Rural Development Division has reviewed the program and&#13;
announced the budget available, the appropriate adjustments will be made for&#13;
final approval.&#13;
2.3.5     Dissemination of the program&#13;
The program approved by the Rural Development Division will have&#13;
to be disseminated to various decision levels in addition to the usual ones:&#13;
- The PIDER Group for the state.&#13;
- The municipal authorities.&#13;
- The Commonland Farming Commission (Comisariado Ejidal)&#13;
and the Supervisory Council (Consejo de Vigilancia) of&#13;
the localities;&#13;
- The locality meetings.&#13;
The locality meetings have a particular importance in this stage,&#13;
when programming is concluded and implementation begins. It is strongly&#13;
recommended that the final program be communicated to the community-meeting&#13;
level with a clear explanation of the general background of the program and,&#13;
in particular, of the salient features of the projects approved for the&#13;
community concerned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -&#13;
Information should be provided on the changes introduced during&#13;
the preliminary and final programming stages, compared to the initial pro-&#13;
posals put forward by the community. The extension agents, PIDER staff,&#13;
agents from different agencies should develop an education effort around&#13;
the final development programs for the benefit of the villagers, as a means&#13;
of mobilizing community awareness and support to the implementation and moni-&#13;
toring of the program. Community awareness is a formidable developmental&#13;
resource.&#13;
A thorough knowledge by the village community of what the program&#13;
contains, of the implementation schedule, of the resources to be provided by&#13;
the government or to be contributed by the beneficiaries, is an essential&#13;
prerequisite for subsequent effective implementation of the entire program.&#13;

            Mexico - Measuring project impact :
            monitoring and evaluation in the PIDER rural development project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Mexican nationwide program for rural
            development - PIDER -one of the largest of its kind in the
            world, has developed a system for monitoring its
            implementation and for ongoing evaluation of its impact. The
            strengths and weaknesses of this system's experience
            are analyzed in this case study. The methodology for the
            economic and sociological evaluation of the impact of rural
            development programs is only now being developed. The
            lessons which may be derived from PIDER's experience
            refer to a broad range of issues, including the type of
            relevant information which should be collected, the
            definition of the investigation unit, the data generation
            tools, the disaggregation of the data collection process,
            the aggregation of monitoring data and evaluation findings,
            the feeding back of information to management, as well as
            the organizational structures required for carrying out
            monitoring and evaluation.
