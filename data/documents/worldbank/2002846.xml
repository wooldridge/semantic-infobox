            Rural water service - is a private national
            operator a viable business model?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In C?e d'Ivoire and Senegal water
            service is provided by privately operated national water
            utilities operating under enhanced lease contracts. While
            the national operators have performed relatively well within
            their service areas, their ability to expand service to
            rural areas has been limited. This Note focuses on the key
            factors shaping rural service expansion: reliance on
            cross-subsidies, the limited transfer of commercial risk to
            the private sector, and the lack of competition for serving
            new population centers beyond the utilities' existing
            areas of exclusivity. It compares the national model with
            those of more decentralized service provision for rural areas.
