     the private sector of emerging markets,we must offer more than capital.Our experience&#13;

     new market opportunities such as sale of carbon emissions                             countries but in some instances staked out new ways of&#13;

&#13;
Innovation...&#13;
In fiscal 2003, IFC pioneered a number of new approaches to private sector development.&#13;
&#13;
· In Mexico, we entered the municipal finance market for                · From India to Russia to Vietnam, we invested in&#13;
  the first time.                                                         cutting-edge information technology firms and trained&#13;
&#13;
· In China, we developed a new approach to the problem                    workers to increase their high-tech skills.&#13;
&#13;
  of nonperforming loans.                                               · In all regions, we worked to increase the role of smaller&#13;
&#13;
· In Tajikistan, we helped a private company restore                      businesses as suppliers of goods and services to the larger&#13;
&#13;
  hydropower plants while ensuring affordable energy for                  companies in which we invest.&#13;
&#13;
  local people and safeguarding the environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   IFC ENTERS THE MUNICIPAL FINANCE MARKET&#13;
   Municipal governments provide most essential infrastructure services in developing countries but usually lack access to market&#13;
   financing. With a $3 million partial credit guarantee for a water project in Mexico, IFC has entered the municipal finance market.&#13;
   Partnering with a private bank, IFC will provide a peso-denominated guarantee to a private Mexican trust, which will issue bonds&#13;
   up to $8.8 million equivalent in the local capital market. Bond proceeds will be used to provide a loan to the city of Tlalnepantla&#13;
   and its municipal water company for design and construction of a wastewater treatment plant. IFC also helped secure a $5 million&#13;
   letter of credit from a private lender.&#13;
      This project is both the first municipal bond offering in Mexico that is not reliant on sovereign support and the World Bank Group's&#13;
   first direct financial support to a municipality. It creates a model whereby municipalities in Mexico can secure financing entirely&#13;
   through their own revenues rather than a federal guarantee or assignment of federal transfers--and can mitigate their foreign exchange&#13;
   risk. The transaction also introduces a new local asset class for the country's capital markets.&#13;
      The wastewater treatment plant, the first in Mexico's most industrialized municipality, will stop sewage from flowing untreated&#13;
   into the Rio San Javier. The plant will recycle residential and industrial wastewater for industrial reuse and free up potable water.&#13;
   It should also relieve pressure on heavily exploited groundwater aquifers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                             INNOVATION, IMPACT, SUSTAINABILITY: IFC'S COMMITMENT             5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      Impact...&#13;
      IFC seeks out business sectors with the greatest potential for raising living standards.&#13;
&#13;
     We place special emphasis on countries that have low                   · But because investment alone is sometimes insufficient,we&#13;
     incomes or present high risks for investors,and we pinpoint              provide technical assistance and advisory services to help&#13;
     ways that they can improve their investment climates.We                  ensure that business loans and equity investments,now and&#13;
     also remain committed to addressing the evolving needs of                in the future, will have sustained economic benefits.&#13;
     the private sector in middle-income countries.                         · In countries experiencing economic downturns, we also&#13;
     · For our investments--ranging from a port in Pakistan to                play a critical role, making working capital available and&#13;
       microfinance banks in Azerbaijan, Chad, and El                         leading the way for the private sector to invest again.&#13;
       Salvador--we work to leverage the positive impact of the&#13;
       projects we finance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     THE EQUATOR PRINCIPLES&#13;
     In June 2003, ten major international banks adopted the Equator Principles, a voluntary set of&#13;
     guidelines based on the environmental and social guidelines and safeguard policies of IFC. These&#13;
     principles will be applied to the project finance activities of these banks, globally and in all industry&#13;
     sectors. In drafting the Equator Principles, the banks received extensive advice and guidance from&#13;
     IFC. These ten banks underwrote about $14.5 billion in project loans during 2002, representing&#13;
     some 30 percent of the project loan syndication market globally. The following banks&#13;
     adopted the Equator Principles:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     · ABN AMRO Bank, N.V.            · HVB Group&#13;
&#13;
     · Barclays PLC                   · Rabobank&#13;
&#13;
     · Citigroup, Inc.                · Royal Bank of Scotland&#13;
&#13;
     · Credit Lyonnais                · WestLB AG&#13;

     · Credit Suisse Group            · Westpac Banking Corporation&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Sustainability...&#13;
Sustainable development--improving corporate governance and taking environmental and social issues&#13;
into account--is at the heart of IFC's business.&#13;
&#13;
But we go even further:we explore ways to turn sustainable               · We helped industrial companies reduce greenhouse gas&#13;
development into commercial opportunities.Fiscal year 2003                  emissions, in some cases through expected sales in the&#13;
saw a range of these activities:                                            emerging market for carbon emission credits.&#13;
· We maintained our commitment to smaller businesses by                  · We educated employers and workers through the&#13;
  providing a wide range of technical assistance and                        IFC Against AIDS program and helped the Brazilian&#13;
  advisory services and by helping financial institutions                   government launch its Zero Hunger initiative.&#13;
  serve these clients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   PROVIDING ELECTRICITY AND SAFEGUARDING THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the subsequent civil war, and sharp economic decline, the diesel generation plants in the&#13;
   Gorno-Badakhshan region of eastern Tajikistan ceased to operate. As a result, the population of this very poor region has come to depend&#13;
   on wood as fuel, and an estimated 70 percent of the tree cover has been cut down in a decade. Schools and other public&#13;
   institutions have had to close during the coldest weather, indoor pollution has become acute, and economic activity has been stifled.&#13;
   IFC and the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development have established Pamir Energy, a private concessionaire that is taking control&#13;
   of hydropower plants and other facilities that serve 250,000 residents and were previously state owned. The project, the first private&#13;
   investment in the power sector in Tajikistan, will double the capacity of a Soviet-era power plant, improve transmission and distribution&#13;
   facilities, and regulate the level of a lake to ensure adequate flow in the winter. The project also aims to reduce emissions and natural&#13;
   resource depletion. It will create local contract employment during construction, and a more reliable power supply will contribute to the&#13;
   region's economic recovery.&#13;
&#13;
     IFC is investing $8 million in the new company, of which $3.5 million is in equity and $4.5 million in loans. With donor support, we&#13;
   earlier provided the technical assistance needed to structure and fund this investment. In an innovative example of IFC­World Bank&#13;
   cooperation, IDA is providing $10 million to the Tajik government to help keep tariff rates affordable for the local population. A further&#13;
   grant from the Swiss government will ensure that a minimum monthly supply of electricity is delivered at a very low rate to even the&#13;
   poorest households.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
          FC focuses its efforts where they make the greatest difference. We invest in the sectors&#13;
      I&#13;
          and countries that the private sector is unwilling or unable to enter on its own,either&#13;
      because of an adverse economic situation or because business success has not been&#13;
      demonstrated there before. We also play a catalytic role for other project sponsors,&#13;
      including commercial banks, to invest in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
      Through technical assistance,advisory services,and research,we are helping developing&#13;
      countries improve their investment climates and strengthen the capacity of their&#13;
      private sector to expand and operate.These nonlending services from IFC and itsWorld&#13;
      Bank Group partners help ensure that a country's economy will benefit over the long&#13;
      term from private sector investment.&#13;
        IFC also demonstrates its commitment to countries in economic crisis, playing a key&#13;
      countercyclical role when there is a retreat of private capital.In fiscal 2003,we helped clients&#13;
      in Brazil and Argentina secure vital trade financing, in collaboration with international&#13;
      banks through the B-loan program. Similar investments we made in East Asia during the&#13;
      crisis of the late 1990s have brought long-term economic benefits.&#13;

&#13;
  The Doing Business project, a joint initiative of IFC and&#13;
the World Bank, fills this gap by creating new, quantitative&#13;
indicators on business regulations and their enforcement&#13;
and by analyzing the relationship of these regulations to&#13;
economic outcomes.The indicators can be compared over&#13;
time and across more than 130 countries. Topics covered&#13;
include business registration, labor regulations, contract&#13;
enforcement, creditor rights, and bankruptcy. New topics&#13;
will be added in 2004 and 2005 and updated annually.&#13;
Findings will be published in the annual Doing Business&#13;
report--launched this year in both Web and hard-copy&#13;
versions--as well as an online database of indicators,&#13;
academic papers, and country analyses.&#13;

   REDUCING EMISSIONS, HELPING THE COMMUNITY&#13;
   Usha Beltron is India's leading manufacturer of specialized wires, steel wire ropes, and rods--and the world's fourth largest.&#13;
   But like other midsize companies in India, it has limited access to long-term financing. IFC played a key role in restructuring&#13;
   Usha Beltron's operations by providing debt and equity financing on its own account and by mobilizing loans from other investors.&#13;
   IFC also provided the company with valuable advice on setting up a cogeneration power plant that will reduce emissions and&#13;
   power costs by using waste flue gases from the company's iron plant to generate power.&#13;
     Usha Beltron has a strong corporate commitment to community development. It sponsors Krishi Gram Vikas Kendra, a&#13;
   nongovernmental organization whose activities include watershed development projects in more than 50 villages near Usha&#13;
   Beltron's plants; health care and agricultural development programs in two of India's poorest states, Bihar and Jharkhand; and&#13;
   women's enterprise development in partnership with the Self-Employed Women's Association. Usha Beltron also operates research&#13;
   and learning centers that offer training in business management to small businesses and other local manufacturers.&#13;

      I&#13;
          technical assistance and advisory services that strengthen businesses. Key capacity-&#13;
      building initiatives include training and advisory services for small and medium&#13;

      INVESTMENT AT THE GRASS-ROOTS LEVEL&#13;
      In frontier markets where private capital flows are limited at best, grass-roots groups' income&#13;
      generation projects can make a big difference in poor people's lives. This year, for example,&#13;
      the Mekong Private Sector Development Facility helped create a commercially viable small&#13;
      business in partnership with Hagar, a Cambodian nongovernmental organization that has&#13;
      rebuilt the lives of 20,000 destitute mothers and children over the past decade.&#13;
        MPDF has been active with Hagar since 1999, providing business advice on the planned&#13;
      commercialization of the nonprofit group's silk handicrafts and soy milk production activi-&#13;
      ties. For the latter, MPDF conducted a market study that showed great potential demand for&#13;
      a repackaged product. It then helped shape the business proposal that this year attracted a&#13;
      $450,000 IFC equity investment in newly launched Hagar Soya Ltd. and agreed to provide&#13;
      postinvestment marketing and sales support to Hagar as well. This financing will allow Hagar&#13;
      Soya to expand its daily output from 300 to as many as 12,000 liters per day. It will use&#13;
      locally grown soybeans to produce a nutritious drink that is affordable for Cambodia's poor                                                    MPDF&#13;

&#13;
        MPDF has also helped Hagar Design, enabling it to obtain $65,000 in funding from IFC's&#13;
      SME Capacity Building Facility to improve its silk production operations. Hagar Design has&#13;
      established an international market and employs more than 50 previously disadvantaged&#13;

   IMPROVING PRACTICES TO MAINTAIN MARKET ACCESS&#13;
   Favorita Fruit, an IFC client in Ecuador, is a pioneering firm on environmental and social issues. In 1999, its banana exporting&#13;
   subsidiary, Agricola Bananera Reybancorp, had all the banana farms it owns certified by Rainforest Alliance for environmental and&#13;
   labor practices. Through Fundacion Wong, named after the company's founder, Favorita supports over 30 schools for children in&#13;
   the rural areas from which it sources bananas. Supporting schools complements Favorita's leadership in efforts to eradicate child&#13;
   labor in the banana fields through the exporters' trade association, CORPEI.&#13;
      In 2003, Favorita and IFC's Corporate Citizenship Facility have begun to develop and implement a program of outreach and&#13;
   training for independent banana suppliers, which account for over half the company's exports. The program will impart basic&#13;
   environmental and labor practices that are becoming essential for Ecuadoran farmers to maintain access to markets in the EU and&#13;
   the United States. It consists of sessions in each of four banana-growing regions and field visits to certified Favorita facilities. There&#13;
   is no charge for farmers to attend the training. The project has the potential to affect environmental and labor practices on 18,000&#13;
   hectares of banana plantations and to influence the lives of thousands of workers. The facility is funding all training costs and&#13;
   materials and the rental of venues for training. Favorita Fruit is providing staff support and all transportation.&#13;

SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM SAVING SPECIES&#13;
As part of its commitment to preserving biodiversity in developing countries, IFC has launched innovative projects in Peru and&#13;
Mongolia in partnership with local civil society organizations. The projects are funded by the Global Environment Facility.&#13;
 In the rainforests of Peru, IFC is working with two nongovernmental organizations to establish a ranching and export business for&#13;
poison dart frogs. This will help rural communities generate income from a practice that enriches the rainforest rather than&#13;
depleting its diversity. The project is expected to stabilize or increase the population of at least 60 frog species, many of which have&#13;
been smuggled out of the area. It will also employ about 250 families and conserve more than 3,000 hectares of tropical forest.&#13;
 In northern Mongolia, IFC invested in a river conservation project that will protect the Siberian salmon, a threatened fish species,&#13;
and provide a sustainable source of income for local nomadic communities.The project contributes $1 million to help the Taiman&#13;
Conservation Fund, a nongovernmental organization, develop a financially sustainable conservation management system for the&#13;
Eg-Urr watershed. The plan allows for development of low-impact tourism in this wild and scenic waterway.&#13;

      Improving Use of Resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             ocusing on sustainability makes good sense for business. IFC's current work in the&#13;
      F&#13;
             energy sector--with utilities, private companies, and financial institutions--&#13;
      provides examples of how innovative approaches to project finance can allow the&#13;
      private sector to achieve environmental benefits while enhancing profitability.&#13;
&#13;
      Our investments,for example,include projects that commercialize energy efficiency in&#13;
      several Central European countries (see box). IFC is also breaking new ground in the&#13;
      market for greenhouse gas emission reductions--also called carbon credits--together&#13;
      with government and private sector buyers of emission reductions and sponsors in&#13;
      developing countries (see box). Industrialized countries that ratify the Kyoto Protocol&#13;
      will be required, once it comes into force, to reduce emissions they produce&#13;
      domestically. These countries can also meet a part of their obligation by purchasing&#13;
      carbon credits from projects in developing countries.&#13;
        IFC supports this market-based approach through several World Bank Group&#13;
      facilities that purchase carbon credits.For developing countries,the sale of carbon credits&#13;
      will encourage the transfer of cleaner technologies at an effectively reduced cost. For&#13;
      developed countries,the purchase of credits increases the range of options for complying&#13;
      with the Kyoto Protocol. Use of a market-based system is a groundbreaking step for&#13;
      achieving environmentally beneficial impacts globally,and IFC is actively facilitating the&#13;
      development of this market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      COMMERCIALIZING ENERGY EFFICIENCY FINANCE&#13;
      Central European countries remain three to five times more inefficient in energy use than their Western European neighbors.&#13;
      This inefficiency impairs economic competitiveness, creates social pressures, causes air pollution, and poses obstacles to EU&#13;
      accession. The demand for new, energy-efficient technologies is strong, but there is little capital available. Local financial&#13;
      intermediaries consider energy efficiency projects high risk because of their novelty and the difficulty in structuring collateral.&#13;
        To promote such projects, IFC, in partnership with the Global Environment Facility and bilateral donors, has established a&#13;
      $90 million guarantee facility, including up to $75 million invested by IFC. The facility provides a partial guarantee for loans&#13;
      made by local financial intermediaries when they invest in energy efficiency projects. This innovative structure will enable IFC&#13;
      to leverage more than $225 million in private capital investments. IFC launched a similar project in Hungary in 1997 and&#13;
      began this new initiative in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovakia in June 2002.&#13;
        The goal is to build a sustainable market for financing energy efficiency. The initiative uses a combination of technical&#13;
      assistance and credit enhancement instruments to enable local financial institutions to develop a profitable business in&#13;
      energy efficiency lending.&#13;
        This effort will have significant economic, environmental, and social benefits, and it supports the participating countries'&#13;
      targets for EU accession. Examples of program impacts in Hungary include investments in projects to upgrade street lighting&#13;
      in small towns in the poorest parts of the country and to replace outdated, unreliable heating technologies in hospitals.&#13;

MARKET MECHANISMS THAT REDUCE EMISSIONS&#13;
In addition to offering project financing, for eligible projects IFC can help companies increase their income while reducing&#13;
environmental impacts. For example, IFC recently committed $15 million in financing to Balrampur Chini Mills Limited, one of&#13;
India's premier sugar companies, to help finance a 20-megawatt cogeneration plant that will produce electricity from the biomass&#13;
waste product of its sugar operations. The IFC-Netherlands Carbon Facility is also negotiating to purchase up to 2 million tonnes&#13;
of emission reductions from their operations.&#13;
  Another example of combining conventional project financing and carbon financing to help companies lower costs and&#13;
increase efficiency is the El Canadá hydroelectric project in western Guatemala, which will displace about 144,000 tonnes&#13;
annually of greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise be generated through thermal plants. In addition to $27 million in&#13;
financing (including a $12 million syndicated loan), IFC collaborated with the sponsors and the Prototype Carbon Fund to arrange&#13;
carbon credit financing.&#13;
  IFC is also promoting the market for greenhouse gas emission reductions by helping companies in which it is not investing&#13;
directly. This year the IFC-Netherlands facility struck a C15 million deal to purchase 5 million tonnes of emission reductions&#13;
                                                          =&#13;
&#13;
from V&amp;M do Brasil, a leading producer of steel tubes in Brazil that uses sustainably produced biomass charcoal instead of coal&#13;
in its steel production. Revenues from this sale of carbon credits will be used by the company to continue maintaining its biomass&#13;
plantations. IFC also facilitated a one-time sale of 400,000 tonnes of credits by V&amp;M to Toyota Tsusho Corporation of Japan.&#13;

        arm of the World Bank Group, is a global investor and&#13;
advisor committed to developing a sustainable private sector in&#13;
emerging markets.For many years,we have sought convergence&#13;
and common ground between the pursuit of financial gain,the&#13;
need for economic growth, and the safeguarding of the&#13;
environment and people's interests.We are cognizant of lessons&#13;
learned through our nearly 50 years of service and are&#13;
committed to ensuring that we are part of solutions that work&#13;

theme for the institution, its staff, and the clients with whom&#13;
we work.This report shares with stakeholders our intentions,&#13;

&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY--&#13;
MORE THAN A THEME, IT IS OUR STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability is central to IFC's move to position itself as a supplier of broad commercial&#13;
expertise, not merely capital, to our private sector clients in the developing world.&#13;
There were few institutions similar to IFC in the early decades of our existence.&#13;
Now there are more than 30 bilateral, multilateral, and export credit agencies providing&#13;
capital to private sector firms in developing countries.What differentiates IFC is our ability&#13;
to provide value to our clients above and beyond financing.This value comes from the&#13;
expertise we have amassed over nearly half a century,from our global reach,and from our&#13;
unique capabilities--particularly our expertise on environmental and social matters.&#13;
  For IFC, sustainability is an essential element of business success as well as a means of&#13;
achieving enhanced development impact.&#13;

          Commercial Banks Adopt IFC's Environmental and Social Policies&#13;
&#13;
          Through consultation with IFC, ten major international banks have decided to adopt environmental and social monitoring&#13;
          procedures in their global project finance activities based on IFC and the World Bank's environmental and social policies and guide-&#13;
          lines. The banks have all agreed to what have become known as the Equator Principles (see box, p. 6). Four more banks have already&#13;
          signed on, and others are expected to adopt these principles in the coming months.&#13;
              Banks agreeing to the principles will review potential projects much as IFC does for its own investment activities. These&#13;
          investment projects will be categorized for environmental and social impact using the same criteria as IFC. Based on this ex ante&#13;
          categorization, projects will be expected to comply with the requirements for environmental assessments, environmental&#13;
          management plans, and public disclosure as similarly used in IFC projects.&#13;

    BRAZIL: COMBATING HUNGER AND POVERTY&#13;
    Although a decade of economic liberalization has given Brazil a better foundation for improving living standards, millions of&#13;
    people still live on less than $1 a day. The new administration of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has launched Fome Zero&#13;
    (Zero Hunger), a major campaign to address the issue of social inequality, focusing on food security for poor people and calling&#13;
    for involvement of the private sector and civil society. IFC is supporting this campaign and rallying the country's private sector&#13;
    to participate.&#13;
      As a first step, the Brazilian government has allocated funds to supply 1.5 million of its neediest families with a monthly&#13;
    subsidy to buy food. For its part, IFC is granting $300,000 to the Ethos Institute, a nongovernmental organization, and the&#13;

      EGYPT: IFC CLIENT SUBJECT OF INNOVATIVE BUSINESS SCHOOL STUDY&#13;
      Alexandria Carbon Black, a client of IFC since 1992 and a company that understands the contribution that environmental and&#13;
      social issues make to business performance, was recently the subject of a study conducted by students at Harvard Business School.&#13;
      The company was selected because it has demonstrated the positive results that can be achieved by committing to sustainable&#13;
      development. The study attempted to calculate the returns to society and the local economy from the investment.&#13;
        Although carbon black, an industrial by-product that is a main component in tire manufacture, is notoriously unfriendly to the&#13;
      environment, ACB has succeeded in managing the production process to minimize negative impacts. The company has attained&#13;
      numerous certifications: ISO 14001 for environmental management, OHSAS 18001 for health and safety in carbon black, ISO&#13;
      9002 for general management, and QS 9000 for quality assurance. The students identified benefits realized by the employees,&#13;
      the local community, customers, and suppliers, as well as the Egyptian economy as a whole.&#13;
        ACB provided the students with a wealth of information, not only on its environmental and social efforts but also on its finan-&#13;
      cial performance. IFC seeks to facilitate clients' participation in such partnerships, so that good corporate practices can be docu-&#13;
      mented and publicized for the benefit of the wider private sector in emerging markets.&#13;

      COMPLIANCE ADVISOR/OMBUDSMAN&#13;
&#13;
      Safeguards Review&#13;
      In 2001, IFC senior management commissioned the Office of the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman to review the implementation&#13;
      and impact of IFC's safeguard policies since their formal adoption in 1998. The CAO was also asked to make recommendations on&#13;
      the content of the policies and their means of application in IFC's work. This review was completed in January 2003.&#13;
         The main conclusion is that the commitment of the client firm to environmental and social issues is the key determinant of success&#13;
      in implementing IFC's policies and guidelines successfully. The review points out that it is commitment, not capacity, that is crucial.&#13;
      An IFC client might lack the resources or expertise to implement a thorough environmental and social management system, but as&#13;
      long as the firm is committed IFC can work in partnership with it to improve capacity. Where commitment is lacking, however, ample&#13;
      capacity may not lead to positive outcomes. Hence the review recommends that commitment in environmental and social areas should&#13;
      be a major factor in the selection of future IFC clients.&#13;
         The review also calls for further simplification and focusing of the policies and guidelines to match the realities of the private sector&#13;
      and for IFC to be able to make periodic amendments to address changing circumstances. The review recommends improving internal&#13;
      processes for implementing the safeguards and mainstreaming environmental and social concerns throughout IFC's business units.&#13;
      The full CAO report is available on the CAO's Web site at www.cao-ombudsman.org.&#13;
&#13;
      Compliance audit role&#13;
      As part of its function as an independent assurance mechanism for environmental and social concerns, the CAO is charged with&#13;
      ensuring that IFC diligently monitors client companies' compliance with environmental and social policies and guidelines. The CAO's&#13;
      office has formalized its compliance audit role for environmental and social issues by hiring a senior specialist for compliance and&#13;
      publishing a guidance document to explain the audit role, the triggers for a compliance audit, and the principles underpinning conduct&#13;
      of an audit.&#13;
         Compliance audits will be instituted in instances where an IFC project is alleged to be operating outside the bounds of its&#13;
      environmental and social policies and guidelines. Audits can be initiated by complaints made to the CAO by external stakeholders,&#13;
      by a request from senior management, or on the authority of the CAO. Although audits will focus on how safeguard policies and&#13;
      associated guidelines were applied to projects by IFC staff, the overarching goal of enhancing the environmental and social outcomes&#13;
      of projects will be stressed throughout the audit process.&#13;

         What IFC has not been able to do systematically before now            How are projects assessed?&#13;
      is to predict a project's sustainable development impacts except         IFC has developed a framework to facilitate assessments of&#13;

At IFC our mandate is to further sustainable economic development&#13;
through the private sector. We pursue this goal through innovative&#13;
solutions to the challenges of development, as we invest in companies&#13;
and financial institutions in emerging markets and as we help build&#13;
business skills.We consider positive development impact an integral part&#13;
of good business, and we focus much of our effort on the countries with&#13;
the greatest need for investment. We recognize that economic growth&#13;
is sustainable only if it is environmentally and socially sound and helps&#13;
improve the quality of life for those living in developing countries.&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2003 : innovation, impact, sustainability -
            IFC's commitment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This annual report reviews the oerations
            of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) during fiscal
            year 2003. IFC's operating income for FY03 grew to $528
            million, more than triple the figure for FY02 and one of the
            highest on record. Its committed portfolio grew by 11.5
            percent to $16.8 billion. It was a year that emphasized
            coordination, and mutually reinforcing efforts among World
            Bank Group units, particularly in pursuing private sector
            development in client countries. The report stresses the
            need for support of IFC's priorities, including
            emerging, and frontier markets, technical assistance, and
            advisory services to help improve investment climates, and
            small and medium enterprises. Also underscored, is the
            significance of IFC's presence in difficult, country
            environments as a central component of its development
            mandate, while IFC's counter-cyclical role in the face
            of heightened investor uncertainty, and volatility of
            capital flows to developing countries, is recognized, as is
            the performance within the annual portfolio performance
            review, despite continued difficulty in the global economic
            environment. IFC's financial management is reviewed,
            and its leadership for protecting the Corporation's
            financial integrity, without compromising its development
            mandate, was commendable, though the need to maintain
            profitability, while increasing development impacts, is
            stressed. The report presents financial highlights,
            particularly outlining IFC's commitment to innovation,
            impact, and sustainability, and further identifies the
            period's operational, and regional outlook. The report
            also summarizes the financial and portfolio reviews, as well
            as technical assistance and advisory services during FY03.
