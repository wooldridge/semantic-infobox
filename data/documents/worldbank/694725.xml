ARMENIA&#13;
SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCING OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    The proposed supplemental financing would increase the IDA support for the ongoing&#13;
Armenia Highway Project, which would remain as described in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)&#13;
No. 14301-AM dated August 22,1995, except for the substitution of IDA financing in place of&#13;
the Kuwait Fund cofinancing of US$15 million. Therefore, this Technical Annex will only&#13;
describe those aspects of the project that are needed to reflect the changes from the situation that&#13;
is described in the SAR for the original project.&#13;
B. Progress to Date Under IDA Credit Number 27760-AM&#13;
2.    As described in the Memorandum and Recommendation of the President (MOP), progress&#13;
under the existing project has been excellent. ARD moved quickly to set up an effective Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU), and staffed it with well qualified staff with the intention that it will&#13;
be retained after the completion of the project and merged into the regular ARD structure. The&#13;
PIU staff have become familiar with and can perform cost benefit analysis using the World Bank&#13;
HDM computer program to determine priorities for road maintenance decisions. The PIU has&#13;
carried out competitive bidding successfully in 1996 under National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
procedures for the civil works component of the project, and has now completed the preparation&#13;
of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) documents for the bidding in 1997. Accounts have&#13;
been established and an auditor has been engaged. The equipment financed from the IDA Credit&#13;
has been purchased and delivered, and a Plant Pool has been established to manage and maintain&#13;
it.&#13;
3.    12 civil works contracts for repaving were awarded in 1996 for a total value of about&#13;
US$6 million. A delay in the receipt of the bitumen from a foreign supplier led to some delay,&#13;
and some contracts were not able to be completed in the 1996 construction season. However,&#13;
this work will be completed early in 1997 at no additional cost to ARD. Training in the&#13;
application of surface dressings was carried out by ARD, but two contractors nevertheless had&#13;
some problems in obtaining acceptable surfaces on a portion of their work and had to make&#13;
repairs in order to make the work acceptable. Additional training will be provided in 1997 to&#13;
try to avoid similar problems this year. Also, good progress has been made by the local design&#13;
institute, which has carried out the design and preparation of the bidding documents and has&#13;
supervised the civil works contracts with the assistance of a foreign consultant. Local contractors&#13;
have benefitted from training and the experience of carrying out the first civil works contracts&#13;
under competitive bidding procedures, which is an important start to the development of an&#13;
effective road construction industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
4.    As described in the MOP, the Government's difficulties in providing the counterpart&#13;
funding and support for ARD's budget as required by the provisions of the Credit Agreement&#13;
have been the most serious problem for the project in its first year and one half. Payments are&#13;
current at present, and the enactment of the proposed excise tax on vehicle fuel will help to&#13;
reduce the problem in the future. However, the longer run ability of the Government to be able&#13;
to provide financing at a level required to maintain the entire network will depend on the overall&#13;
rate of economic recovery and development that takes place in Armenia as well as what decisions&#13;
the Government makes regarding road user charges.&#13;
5.    The project is being implemented in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the&#13;
Credit Agreement. A modest schedule of road user charges was put into effect as a condition of&#13;
effectiveness under the previously approved Credit.  While this schedule of charges was&#13;
appropriate based on the economic conditions at that time, a more adequate level of charges is&#13;
needed over the longer run. There was some delay in the preparation of a study of the required&#13;
level of financing needed to maintain the road network and possible financing and collection&#13;
mechanisms for obtaining it, as described in para. 16 of the MOP, but this study has now been&#13;
completed and can serve as a basis for further consideration of this issue. In view of the&#13;
difficulties in obtaining payments of counterpart funds and support for ARD's budget, an agreed&#13;
schedule of road user charges and a timetable for its implementation will be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
C. Uses of the Supplemental Financing&#13;
6.    The allocation of project costs will remain the same as for the original project, as shown&#13;
on Page 1 of Appendix 1. Within the Periodic Road Maintenance category, however, the portion&#13;
of surface dressings has declined and the amount of overlays has increased in view of the&#13;
additional deterioration of the road network since the survey was carried out, as anticipated in&#13;
para. 4.5 of the original SAR. Generally, the supplemental financing would finance the&#13;
components that are indicated for Kuwait Fund financing in the original SAR. This includes&#13;
repaving of portions of the Interstate Road Network, rehabilitation of a tunnel on an important&#13;
road link to Georgia, the purchase of materials (mainly bitumen and fuel) for routine and winter&#13;
maintenance, equipment (see Annex C of the SAR for an illustrative list of equipment to be&#13;
purchased under the project), and an additional year of project administrative expenses. A revised&#13;
Detailed Financing Plan is presented on Page 2 of Appendix 1.&#13;
D. Implementation&#13;
7.   Implementation would continue on the same basis as the present project, as described in&#13;
the original SAR. The project would, however, be extended for one year because of the delay&#13;
in identifying all of the financing, and would now be expected to be completed by June 30, 2000.&#13;
The Closing Date would be December 31, 2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
8.    The supervision of the project would also be extended by one year. Three Bank&#13;
supervision missions would be carried out each year, staffed by a senior highway engineer and&#13;
such specialists as may be appropriate for each aspect of the project (such as procurement,&#13;
training, traffic safety, and financial analysis), each of about one week duration. Missions would&#13;
review physical progress and would assist in coordinating the cofinanced elements of the project.&#13;
Cofinanciers would be invited to participate in all supervision missions. A revised Supervision&#13;
Plan is included as Appendix 2 and revised Project Monitoring Indicators are shown in Appendix&#13;
3.&#13;
E. Procurement&#13;
9.    The procurement arrangements and the Procurement Plan and Schedule, which combine&#13;
the original IDA Credit funding with the proposed supplemental financing, are shown in&#13;
Appendices 4 and 5, with the proposed supplemental financing shown in bold. A revised&#13;
Summary of Proposed Procurement Arrangements is attached to the MOP as Schedule B.&#13;
10.   The procurement provisions and limitations described in the original SAR and included&#13;
in the Credit Agreement for the original IDA Credit would apply to the supplementary financing&#13;
without change. All of the equipment procured with supplemental financing would be purchased&#13;
under one ICB tender, and the bitumen for routine maintenance would be purchased under two&#13;
ICB tenders (one in each of two years). The periodic maintenance work would be procured&#13;
under four ICB tenders (two in each of two years) and the tunnel rehabilitation would be&#13;
procured under one ICB tender.&#13;
F. Disbursements&#13;
11.   The proceeds of the supplementary financing would be distributed as shown in Schedule&#13;
B of the MOP. These amounts would be added to the amounts in the existing IDA Credit.&#13;
Disbursements of the supplementary financing are expected to be completed within a three year&#13;
period, as shown in the Disbursement Schedule in Appendix 6.&#13;
G. Economic Benefits&#13;
12.   The Estimated Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) for the periodic maintenance&#13;
component on the main road network, which accounts for 57 percent of the total project costs,&#13;
was calculated to be 38 percent in an analysis prepared by the consulting firm TecnEcon and&#13;
published as "The Armenia Highway Survey" dated September 1994. The analysis used the&#13;
World Bank Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM.-.III) to calculate the benefits. This&#13;
alialysis is still valid, since the costs used in the analysis have been confirmed as realistic based&#13;
on the results of the first year's actual prices, and the traffic volume growth estimates used in the&#13;
analysis have been reached or exceeded. The analysis also found that the results of the study&#13;
were relatively insensitive to quite large variations in assumed traffic growth, with most variations&#13;
making no more than a two percent difference in the EIRR compared to the medium traffic&#13;
growth estimate. The consultant who prepared the economic analysis for the original project did&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
not calculate the Net Present Value of the periodic maintenance component, but the high level&#13;
of economic return indicates that the Net Present Value would also be acceptably high.&#13;
13.   The tunnel rehabilitation, which accounts for 8.6 percent of total project costs, would&#13;
be included in the supplemental financing. It is urgently needed since it is on a major route to&#13;
Georgia, is in very poor condition with the concrete ceiling beginning to collapse, and the road&#13;
bed is deteriorating due to water flows that are not controlled by the present structure. The EIRR&#13;
for this work has been calculated as 50 percent based on traffic growth of 2 percent per year.&#13;
Sensitivity analysis indicates that traffic growth of 0 and a 20 percent increase in cost for the&#13;
reconstruction combined reduce the EIRR to a still very acceptable 42 percent.&#13;
14.   A portion of the routine maintenance component, which accounts for 8 percent of the&#13;
total project costs, would also be included in the supplemental financing. The EIRR for the&#13;
increase in investment in routine maintenance is calculated to be 65 percent based on an assumed&#13;
saving in vehicle operating costs related to a reduction in roughness. If traffic growth were 0&#13;
compared to the 2 percent per year assumed in the base care and if the cost of the routine&#13;
maintenance were 20 percent higher, the EIRR would be reduced to 46 percent.&#13;
15.  In summary, the overall EIRR for the components included in the supplemental financing&#13;
would be as follows:&#13;
Table 1.1 Summary of the Economic Analysis&#13;
Total Cost            EIRR          Net Present Value&#13;

*Represents 83 percent of the total cost of the components included in the supplementa&#13;
financing package. See Appendix 7 for additional supporting information regarding the tunnel&#13;
and routine maintenance.&#13;
H. Financial Impact&#13;
16.   ARD is financed entirely from the Government's central budget, and project counterpart&#13;
funds are taken into account as an addition to ARD's regular budget when budget allocations are&#13;
made. Loan interest charges and principle repayments are funded by the Ministry of Finance&#13;
separately from ARD's budget, and therefore do not have a direct impact on ARD finances. The&#13;
road user charges that are now being collected, as well as those under discussion in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
Parliament, would assist the Ministry of Finance to have the means to provide resources to ARD,&#13;
but would accrue to the Ministry and not to ARD. Therefore, there would not be a direct&#13;
financial impact from the project other than to provide ARD with more resources in the near term&#13;
fur maintaining the roads.&#13;
I. Other Project Benefits and Risks&#13;
17.   Project benefits and risks are as spelled out in the MOP. Two risks identified in the&#13;
original project have not been mentioned in the MOP, namely whether ARD has the ability to&#13;
establish an effective road maintenance organization capable of carrying out the project activities&#13;
and the ability of ARD to use contracting techniques effectively, since ARD has demonstrated&#13;
the ability to do these things during the first year and one half of project activity.&#13;
J. Agreements Reached&#13;
18.   The covenants in the original Credit Agreement would apply in full to the supplemental&#13;
financing. A condition of effectiveness would be the submission of a schedule of road user&#13;
charges and a timetable for its implementation acceptable to IDA.&#13;

            Armenia - Supplemental Financing of a
            Highway Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Highway Project
            are to assist in preserving the Armenian road network,
            thereby avoiding costly rehabilitation or reconstruction at
            a later date, and to improve the efficiency of
            Armenia's road maintenance operations for the future.
            The specific objectives are to: 1) help preserve the
            Armenian national road network and reduce transport
            operating costs by expanding maintenance operations,
            including bridge and tunnel rehabilitation; 2) help develop
            an institutional framework adapted to the requirements of
            the road sector of a market economy; 3) expand the resource
            base for road maintenance by encouraging appropriate road
            user charges; and 4) assist in developing an effective
            private road construction and engineering industry; and 5)
            improve road safety. The project components are: 1) periodic
            highway maintenance; 2) bridges and tunnels; 3) materials
            for routine maintenance; 4) equipment and spare parts; 5)
            institutional strengthening and technical upgrading; and 6)
            project implementation.
