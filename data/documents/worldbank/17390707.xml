 6.1    Ingredients of good performance under alternative institutional forms Till&#13;
Text figures&#13;
 1      As a country's income grows, the amount of infrastructure increases        3&#13;
 2      The composition of infrastructure changes with country income level 4&#13;
 3      Infrastructure has expanded tremendously in recent decades 5&#13;
 4      Urban populations have better access to safe drinking water than rural populations 6&#13;
 5      Annual gains from eliminating mispricing and inefficiency are large relative to investment 11&#13;
 1.1    Public infrastructure investment is a large fraction of both total and public investment in developing&#13;
          countries 14&#13;
 1.2    Per capita availability of major infrastructure is closely related to income levels 16&#13;
 1.3    Infrastructure services differ substantially in their economic characteristics across sectors, within sec-&#13;
          tors, and between technologies 25&#13;
 1.4    The rural-urban gap in access to power and water in developing countries narrowed over the past&#13;
          decade 27&#13;
 1.5    Efficient and effective delivery of infrastructure services does not always accompany increased&#13;
          availability 28&#13;
 1.6    There is very high unmet demand for telephone connection 31&#13;
 1.7    Walking is a transport mode used frequently by the poor 33&#13;
 2.1    The adoption of commercial principles in 1984 allowed Togo's water utility to increase coverage and&#13;
          production. . . but a performance agreement in 1989 was needed to improve financial outcomes 46&#13;
 2.2    Costs are seldom fully recovered in infrastructure 47&#13;
 3.1    Unbundling activities increases the options for competition and private sector involvement          56&#13;
 3.2    Leases and concessions in infrastructure sectors are common, even in low-income countries           60&#13;
 3.3    Privatizations in telecommunications can lead to large gains 65&#13;
 4.1    Countries with decentralized road maintenance have better roads 75&#13;
 4.2    Participation increases water project effectiveness by improving maintenance        76&#13;
 4.3    In water and sewerage, the better-off often get more subsidies than the poor 80&#13;
 4.4    Even in some formerly centrally planned economies, infrastructure subsidies went mainly to the&#13;
          better-off 81&#13;
 5.1    Large shares of official development finance for infrastructure go to energy and transport 90&#13;
 5.2    Official lending for infrastructure has increased, but publicly guaranteed private loans have&#13;
          fallen 90&#13;
 5.3    Infrastructure is a large share of privatization proceeds; foreign financing of infrastructure&#13;
          privatization is important in Latin America 105&#13;
 5.4    Infrastructure equities are contributing to the growth of Argentina's capital market 106&#13;
 5.5    Infrastructure equities have outperformed other stocks by a huge margin 107&#13;
 5.6    Options for financing increase with administrative capacity and maturity of domestic capital&#13;
          markets 108&#13;

Potential payoffs from reform&#13;

Because of the great variation in performance, the&#13;
payoffs from increasing the efficiency of infrastruc-&#13;
ture provision will differ from country to country                 Subsidies               Costs          Annual&#13;

    Reform will produce three types of gains: reduc-&#13;

    Recent studies in the United States suggest that the im-                       frastructure on production costs. Studies (summarized&#13;
    pact of infrastructure investments on economic growth                          in Aschauer 1993) found that infrastructure significantly&#13;
    represents startlingly high rates of return (up to 60 per-                     reduces production costs in manufacturing in Germany,&#13;

    in Box table 1.1 may overestimate the productivity of in-                      United States. One estimate suggests that three-quarters&#13;

    not that investment produces growth. A number of stud-                         on the exact nature of the impact of infrastructure on&#13;

&#13;
ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTUREincluding transport, electric power, telecommunications,&#13;
water and sanitation, and waste disposalproduces services that are vital to development. The&#13;
availability of infrastructure has increased significantly in developing countries over recent&#13;
decades. Yet performance is often poor, inadequate maintenance leads to premature deteriora-&#13;
tion of facilities, and services frequently do not match users' needs and willingness to pay. The&#13;
potential for infrastructure services to contribute to poverty reduction and to environmental&#13;
improvement is often neglected. The time is ripe to broaden the focus of policy beyond increas-&#13;
ing the quantity of infrastructure facilities to improving the quality and efficiency of services.&#13;
  This seventeenth annual World Development Report examines the record of both successes and&#13;
failures in infrastructure provision and concludes that obtaining more effective and efficient&#13;
delivery of services requires important changes in incentives. The Report identifies three ways&#13;
of reforming institutions to improve incentives:&#13;
     Apply principles of commercial managementoperating infrastructure more like a busi-&#13;
ness than a bureaucracy, with clear objectives, with managerial and financial autonomy; and with&#13;
customer satisfaction a key measure of performance.&#13;
     Introduce competitiondirectly where feasible, indirectly where not. By giving users more&#13;
options, competition makes providers more efficient and more accountable to users.&#13;
     Give users and other stakeholders a strong voice and real responsibility in planning, oper-&#13;
ating, regulating, and financing services.&#13;
   Governments will need to act more often as facilitator, coordinator, and guardian of the pub-&#13;
lic interest (especially to ensure access for the poor)and less often as direct operator. The pri-&#13;
vate sector will need to provide management expertise and a significantly greater share of finance&#13;
than in the past. From a broad menu of specific institutional arrangements for infrastructure pro-&#13;
vision, the Report assesses four options by sector and type of country. The Report notes that&#13;
improved performance of infrastructure can enable countries to achieve substantial efficiency&#13;
gains, a higher level of service from existing infrastructure resources, and improved access to&#13;
essential services for the poor.&#13;
   This Report includes the World Development Indicators, which offer comprehensive, current&#13;
data on social and economic development in more than 200 countries and territories. The&#13;
Indicators are also available on diskette. An appendix to the Report provides selected statistics&#13;
on infrastructure.&#13;

            World development report 1994 :
            infrastructure for development
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            World development report 1994, the
            seventeenth in this annual series, examines the link between
            infrastructure and development and explores ways in which
            developing countries can improve both the provision and the
            quality of infrastructure services. In recent decades,
            developing countries have made substantial investments in
            infrastructure, achieving dramatic gains for households and
            producers by expanding their access to services such as safe
            water, sanitation, electric power, telecommunications, and
            transport. Even more infrastructure investment and expansion
            are needed in order to extend the reach of services
            especially to people living in rural areas and to the poor.
            But as this report shows, the quantity of investment cannot
            be the exclusive focus of policy. Improving the quality of
            infrastructure service also is vital. Both quantity and
            quality improvements are essential to modernize and
            diversify production, help countries compete
            internationally, and accommodate rapid urbanization. The
            report identifies the basic cause of poor past performance
            as inadequate institutional incentives for improving the
            provision of infrastructure. To promote more efficient and
            responsive service delivery, incentives need to be changed
            through commercial management, competition, and user
            involvement. Several trends are helping to improve the
            performance of infrastructure. First, innovation in
            technology and in the regulatory management of markets makes
            more diversity possible in the supply of services. Second,
            an evaluation of the role of government is leading to a
            shift from direct government provision of services to
            increasing private sector provision and recent experience in
            many countries with public-private partnerships is
            highlighting new ways to increase efficiency and expand
            services. Third, increased concern about social and
            environmental sustainability has heightened public interest
            in infrastructure design and performance. This report
            includes the World development indicators, which offer
            selected social and economic statistics for 132 countries.
