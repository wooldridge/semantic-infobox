&amp;#12;                                                  Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
         The World Bank published a Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) of the Bulgarian&#13;
justice sector entitled Ã¢&#128;&#156;Resourcing the Judiciary for Performance and Accountability: A Judici al Public&#13;
Expenditure and Institutional ReviewÃ¢&#128;&#157; in 2008. The objective of the present study is to conduct an&#13;
assessment of the spending and institutional changes in BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judiciary from 2008 onwards. The&#13;
current report examines the principal trends in resourcing BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judiciary since 2008, while comparing&#13;
the expenditure and judicial performance with those of other European countries. The report provides a&#13;
set of conclusion and recommendations for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s&#13;
judiciary and the judicial budget1 process.&#13;
&#13;
         As per the latest published report on "European judicial systems Ã¢&#128;&#147; Edition 2014 (2012 data):&#13;
efficiency and quality of justiceÃ¢&#128;&#157;, BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s annual budget per inhabitant for the entire judicial system was&#13;
29.5 euros, which was less than the average of 60.6 euros for the CoE states. However, when compared&#13;
with the per capita GDP, BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s annual budget for its judicial system was 0.54 % of the per capita GDP,&#13;
which was higher than the average of 0.33 % for the CoE states. Despite high judicial expenditure as a&#13;
percentage of per capita GDP, BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judiciary has been under-funded in relation to its budget requests&#13;
and the statutory required minimum salaries for judges. Current expenditures account for 98 % of&#13;
BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judicial budget, the majority of which is for salaries and other remuneration. However, current&#13;
budget levels are insufficient to pay the minimum salary for magistrates prescribed under law. The capital&#13;
budget is also not adequate to meet judicial needs as only about 10-15 % of the judiciaryÃ¢&#128;&#153;s capital budget&#13;
requests are approved by the Parliament. There is scope for the judiciary to increase its own revenues by&#13;
reforming and raising court filing fees. The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has prepared a proposed revision&#13;
of the tariff and submitted it to the Council of Ministers.&#13;
&#13;
         The performance of judiciary in terms of case disposition has been quite satisfactory. The clearance&#13;
rate in Bulgarian courts has been close to 100 % in all of the past 7 years and the disposition time has been&#13;
less than 75 days for all years except 2008, both of which can be considered good performance in&#13;
comparison to other European countries.&#13;
&#13;
         At the same time, the report reveals that there is scope for BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judiciary to reorganize itself&#13;
to improve its efficiency and effectiveness based on an assessment of judicial workloads. There are 2,225&#13;
approved judge positions, against which, 1,811 judges are working. The average actual caseload per judge&#13;
per month at the national level is about 30. There are several courts with caseloads well below this national&#13;
average. As a result, there is scope to redeploy surplus or underworked judges to other courts with high&#13;
caseloads. At the national level, as an initial step in a broader judicial restructuring, the SJC could consider&#13;
reducing the number of approved judge positions to the number of currently filled positions. The ratio of&#13;
judicial staff to inhabitants in Bulgaria is 2.7, which is one of the highest in Eastern European countries.&#13;
The SJC could consider reducing this ratio at the national level (thereby contributing to cost-savings) and&#13;
uniformly distributing the revised national ratio across courts (thereby improving efficiency).&#13;
&#13;
        There are presently 13 district courts where the caseload per judge is less than 10 cases per month&#13;
and 6 regional courts where the caseload is 20 or fewer cases per judge per month, both of which, are well&#13;
below the average for each type of case. It is likely that the number of judges in these courts can be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    Throughout this paper the term Ã¢&#128;&#156;judicial budgetÃ¢&#128;&#157; will be used to refer to the budget of the Bulgarian judicial system.&#13;
&#13;
                                                             6&#13;
&amp;#12;reduced with some judges freed to be redeployed to other courts where there are higher caseloads.&#13;
Similarly, there are 147 judges working in 6 appellate courts, which have an average caseload of only 8&#13;
cases per month. The SJC could consider consolidating the 6 appellate courts into 2 or 3 appellate courts&#13;
and redeploy surplus judges elsewhere. In 4 military courts, there are 19 judges working with an average&#13;
caseload of only 2 cases per judge per month. The SJC could consider consolidating 4 military courts into a&#13;
single military court to handle the existing caseload and redeploy the surplus judges. Among the&#13;
investigation magistrates, the average annual caseload at the National Investigative Service was estimated&#13;
to be 12 cases in 2013, of which only 6 cases were completed and just 0.6 cases led to court indictments.&#13;
The Supreme Judicial Council should carefully examine the potential workload for these magistrates and&#13;
decide how many are required to do the job at hand. The surplus judges could be redeployed elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
         It is possible that the SJC may not be able to identify suitable places for the redeployment of the&#13;
all the judges identified in a court restructuring plan. However, under Bulgarian law, judges cannot be&#13;
removed from service except by way of attrition. Hence, the government may want to consider the option&#13;
of allowing these judges to retire or be deployed elsewhere in the government as an alternative exit route&#13;
to changing the law. Retirement or deployment out of the judiciary would be expected to reduce annual&#13;
recurrent expenditure on salaries, other remuneration and related office expenses in the budget. Given&#13;
the overall costs, it is recommended that a proportion of any savings from restructuring of the sector be&#13;
used to finance increases in salaries and higher capital expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
         At present, there are about 114 judges seconded to other courts through agreements between&#13;
court presidents. There may be an appearance of favoritism when some judges are seconded to higher&#13;
courts with associated increases in wages. To address this issue, the SJC should consider terminating the&#13;
secondment program as it is currently administered (by agreement between court presidents) and assume&#13;
direct responsibility for deciding the placement of seconded judges based on an assessment of the most&#13;
efficient and effective handling of the court caseloads.&#13;
&#13;
        The judiciary has raised concerns that any economies realized in a judicial restructuring program,&#13;
through reduced costs or increased income, could result in the reduction of the governmentÃ¢&#128;&#153;s subsidy to&#13;
the judicial budget leaving overall expenditures at their present insufficient level. The latest State Budget&#13;
Act has, for the first time, provided that if the judiciary fails to reach the budgeted levels of its own income,&#13;
the state budget subsidy would not be raised to compensate any shortfall. (However, this provision was&#13;
recently overturned by the Constitutional Court.) The SJC would like greater predictability in the resources&#13;
they receive from the government budget so that they can undertake necessary reorganization and&#13;
restructuring of the courts and judiciary with confidence that they will have access to necessary resources.&#13;
&#13;
         In light of the opportunities for restructuring the judicial system identified in this paper, it is&#13;
recommended that the SJC, MOJ and MOF reach an agreement on a medium term funding strategy for the&#13;
judiciary. Such an agreement could be based on a judicial restructuring plan that leads to a more efficient&#13;
court system with a more equitable distribution of workload (by redeploying judges, consolidating courts,&#13;
and shrinking judicial and staff positions as necessary) that can be fully funded (both current and capital&#13;
expenditures) without resort to annual debates and uncertainty over supplemental budget requests.&#13;
&#13;
        Apart from the appropriate funding level for the judiciary, there is an issue of over centralized&#13;
decision making at the SJC level. Under existing law, courts must receive prior authorization from the SJC&#13;
for every expenditure that they make from the budget. Court presidents cannot retain any funds or take&#13;
any expenditure decisions on their own. The SJC could consider proposing legal changes that will allow it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       7&#13;
&amp;#12;to decentralize some of its authority by allowing court presidents to retain some percentage of the fees&#13;
that their courts collect. The SJC could frame specific rules defining the object and method by which court&#13;
presidents could use those funds and hold court presidents accountable for the use of these retained funds&#13;
and for prior agreed results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    8&#13;
&amp;#12;                                Summary of Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Revision of court tariffs: A revision of tariff is overdue and it is recommended that the SJCÃ¢&#128;&#153;s&#13;
    proposed revised tariffs be evaluated based on its economic impact and its effects on access to&#13;
    the courts.&#13;
2. Reducing the number of approved judges: SJC could consider reducing the number of approved&#13;
    judge positions to the currently filled positions as an initial step in a broader judicial restructuring.&#13;
3. Reducing number of support staff: The ratio of staff to inhabitants 2.7, which is one of the highest&#13;
    among European countries. The SJC could consider reducing this ratio at the national level and&#13;
    uniformly distributing the revised national ratio across courts.&#13;
4. Redeployment of judges in District and Regional Courts: Bulgaria could reduce the number of&#13;
    judges from 13 district courts with caseload less than 10 cases per judge per month and from 6&#13;
    regional courts with caseloads of 20 or fewer cases per judge per month. These judges could be&#13;
    redeployed in courts with high caseloads.&#13;
5. Consolidation of Appellate Courts: The SJC could consider consolidating 6 appellate courts into 2&#13;
    or 3 appellate courts and redeploy the surplus judges elsewhere.&#13;
6. Consolidation of Military Courts: The SJC could consider consolidating 4 military courts into a&#13;
    single military court to handle the existing caseload.&#13;
7. Reducing the number of Investigation Magistrates: The number of investigation magistrates&#13;
    working at the National Investigation Service (NIS) could be reduced from the present number of&#13;
    approximately 80 based on the current workload.&#13;
8. Consider options for judges who are not redeployed: The government may consider offering a&#13;
    program to allow those judges who cannot be redeployed elsewhere in the judicial system,&#13;
    following the implementation of a judicial restructuring program, to retire from the bench or&#13;
    deploy elsewhere in the government.&#13;
9. Re-appropriation of savings: It is recommended that a portion of nay savings generated by a&#13;
    judicial restructuring plan be used for financing salary increases and higher capital expenditures.&#13;
10. Medium-term funding strategy: It is recommended that SJC, MOJ and MOF reach an agreement&#13;
    on a medium term funding strategy for the judiciary based upon a judicial restructuring plan, tied&#13;
    to the achievement of goals under the Judicial Reform Strategy that can be fully funded without&#13;
    resort to supplementary budgets.&#13;
11. Decentralization of expenditure: The SJC could consider decentralizing its budget authority by&#13;
    allowing court presidents to retain some percentage of the fees that their courts collect for the&#13;
    maintenance and development of their respective courts, and frame accountability rules defining&#13;
    the object and method by which court presidents could use those funds.&#13;
12. Reorganization of secondment program of judges: The SJC could consider terminating the&#13;
    secondment program as it is currently administered by court presidents and assume responsibility&#13;
    itself for deciding the placement of judges in order to improve the efficiency of the court systems.&#13;

&#13;
The World Bank published a Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) of the Bulgarian justice&#13;
sector entitled Ã¢&#128;&#156;Resourcing the Judiciary for Performance and Accountability: A Judicial Public Expenditure&#13;
and Institutional ReviewÃ¢&#128;&#157; in 2008. The paper included a review of selected judicial budget, human&#13;
resources, incentives and infrastructure issues; suggested a process to strengthen management of judicial&#13;
resources; and, proposed benchmarks to track progress on performance and efficiency. The paper analyzed&#13;
the spending of the justice sector over time, including the total spending level and its distribution by&#13;
individual courts and main spending categories and analyzed the various spending drivers, including&#13;
staffing numbers and salary increases. The review also compared spending with indicators such as average&#13;
caseloads and rates of case dispositions to get an idea of the development in productivity. Finally, the&#13;
review looked at a number of institutional factors underpinning the budget process.&#13;

The objective of the present Judicial Performance, Caseload and Expenditure Review is to update the BankÃ¢&#128;&#153;s&#13;
2008 Report and conduct an assessment of the spending and institutional changes in BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judiciary&#13;
from 2008 onwards. A World Bank mission2 travelled to Sofia in June 2015. The mission team reviewed the&#13;
procedures and process for developing and allocating the judicial budget, reviewed the institutional&#13;
framework for developing and implementing this budget, and analyzed the data on judicial expenditures;&#13;
courtsÃ¢&#128;&#153; own revenues; and, performance of the Bulgarian courts. This report and our recommendations&#13;
are focused exclusively on BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judiciary and do not address the issue of the budget or caseload of&#13;
the prosecutors.&#13;
&#13;
The team met with senior officials in the key stakeholder government agencies, which included, inter alia:&#13;
Ms. Nadejda Yordanova, Head of Cabinet, and Mr. Petko Petkov, Deputy Minister, in the Ministry of Justice;&#13;
Mr. Kiril Ananiev, Deputy Minister and Mr. Dobrin Pindjurov, Director Budget in the Ministry of Finance;&#13;
Mr. Kalin Kalpakchiev, Ms. Elka Atanasova, Mr. Mihail Kozharev and Kamen Ivanov, Members of Supreme&#13;
Judicial Council; Ms. Christina Todorova, Director of International Relations in Supreme Judicial Council;&#13;
Ms. Gorista Grancharova-Kozhareva, Vice-President of the National Audit Office; Ms. Anelia Shtereva,&#13;
Deputy Chief of Regional Court in Sofia; Head of Accounts in the Regional Court in Sofia; Mr. Vesselin&#13;
Hadjiev, Chief of Court in the Plovdiv District Court; and, Mr. Kalin Monov, Chief Accountant, Plovdiv district&#13;
Court. The mission team collected publicly available data from these institutions and gathered insights&#13;
into the functioning of judiciary from the key stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
 The current report examines the principal trends in resourcing BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judiciary since 2008, while&#13;
comparing the expenditure and performance with those of other European countries. The report makes&#13;
recommendations for improving the resourcing of BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judiciary in light of the recently updated&#13;
Judicial Sector Reforms Strategy in Bulgaria. The report provides a set of conclusion and recommendations&#13;
for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judiciary and the judicial budget process. More&#13;
comprehensive research on the conclusions and recommendations identified in this report and more&#13;
rigorous exploration of reform paths may be necessary once planned amendments to BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Constitution and Judicial System Act become reality.&#13;

&amp;#12;                             I.       Legal Framework for Administration of Justice&#13;
&#13;
1.       BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s Constitution and Judicial Systems Act constitute the core legal framework for the&#13;
administration of justice. The Constitution provides that the judiciary shall protect the rights and legitimate&#13;
interests of all citizens, legal entities and the State; it shall be independent in the manner and performance&#13;
of its functions; all judges, jurors, prosecutors and investigating magistrates shall be subservient only to&#13;
the law; and it shall have an independent budget. The administration of justice in Bulgaria is based on three&#13;
instances. The courts are state bodies that administer justice in civil, criminal and administrative cases. The&#13;
organization and activities of the Bulgarian courts are governed by the Judicial System Act, which lays down&#13;
the structure and operating principles of the judicial bodies and governs their interaction with each other&#13;
and with the legislative and executive bodies. The territorial jurisdictions of the regional, district,&#13;
administrative, military and appeal courts coincide with the administrative division of the country. The&#13;
organization of courts in Bulgaria is presented in Box 1 below.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Box 1: Organization of Courts in Bulgaria&#13;
&#13;
Regional courts Ã¢&#128;&#147; The regional courts are the main courts for examining cases in the first instance. Their decisions are&#13;
subject to appeal before the relevant district court. There are 113 regional courts of which 27 are in the district&#13;
centers.&#13;
&#13;
District courts Ã¢&#128;&#147; The district courts act as courts of first and second instance. As courts of first instance, they examine&#13;
a precisely defined category of cases involving significant sums or substantial societal interest. When acting as a&#13;
second (appellate) instance, they re-examine decisions taken by the regional courts. There are 28 district courts,&#13;
including Sofia City Court.&#13;
&#13;
Administrative courts - The administrative courts have jurisdiction over all actions seeking the issue, amendment,&#13;
repeal or annulment of administrative acts. They act as second (appellate) instance to the regional courts in some&#13;
categories of administrative cases. There are 28 Administrative courts.&#13;
&#13;
Appellate Courts Ã¢&#128;&#147; These courts consider appeals and objections against first-instance rulings by district courts within&#13;
their territorial jurisdictions. There are 5 Appellate courts.&#13;
&#13;
The Supreme Court of Cassation Ã¢&#128;&#147; The Supreme Court of Cassation is the supreme judicial instance in criminal and&#13;
civil cases. Its jurisdiction covers the entire territory of the Republic of Bulgaria. It exercises supreme judicial review&#13;
over the proper and uniform application of laws by all courts. It has its seat in Sofia.&#13;
&#13;
The Supreme Administrative Court - This court exercises supreme judicial review over the proper and uniform&#13;
application of laws by administrative courts. It deals with complaints and objections against acts by the Council of&#13;
Ministers, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, ministers, heads of other institutions directly subordinate to the&#13;
Council of Ministers, acts of the Supreme Judicial Council, acts of the Bulgarian National Bank, acts of district&#13;
governors and other acts established by statute.&#13;
&#13;
SPECIALIZED COURTS&#13;
&#13;
Military courts - examine, as courts of first instance, criminal cases concerning offences allegedly committed in the&#13;
performance of their duties, or in connection therewith, by generals, officers, non-commissioned officers and rank-&#13;
and-file in the Bulgarian army, civilian staff at the Ministry of Defence and personnel at other ministries and agencies&#13;
within the structures reporting to the Minister of Defence, at the National Security Agency and at the National&#13;
Intelligence Service. There are 3 Military Courts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            11&#13;
&amp;#12;Military Court of Appeal - examines appeals and objections lodged against decisions handed down by military courts&#13;
nationwide. There is only 1 Military Court of Appeal.&#13;
&#13;
The Specialized Criminal Court - which has its seat in Sofia, is equivalent to a district court. Its jurisdiction is laid down&#13;
by law and it deals mostly with organized crime cases.&#13;
&#13;
The Specialized Criminal Court of Appeal - considers appeals and objections lodged against decisions handed down&#13;
by the Specialized Criminal Court.&#13;
&#13;
Arbitration Court at the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry - The Arbitration Court settles civil disputes&#13;
and disputes over filling gaps in contracts or adapting contracts to new circumstances, regardless of whether one or&#13;
both parties have their registered office or domicile in the Republic of Bulgaria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.       All judicial power is exercised in the name of the people and justice shall be administered by the&#13;
Supreme Court of Cassation, the Supreme Administrative Court, courts of appeal, regional courts, courts-&#13;
martial and district courts. Specialized courts can be set up by virtue of law. The Supreme Court of Cassation&#13;
exercises supreme judicial oversight as to the precise and equal application of the law by all courts. The&#13;
Supreme Administrative Court exercises supreme judicial oversight as to the precise and equal application&#13;
of the law in administrative justice.&#13;
&#13;
3.       The governance of the judiciary is entrusted to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), which is&#13;
responsible for recruitment, promotion, reassignment and discipline (including dismissal) of the judicial&#13;
branch officials including judges, prosecutors and investigating magistrates. It also has the responsibility of&#13;
preparing and executing the budget for the judiciary. Under the Judicial System Act, published in State&#13;
Gazette No 64/2007, the SJC is the highest administrative authority and is responsible for managing the&#13;
judiciary and ensuring its independence. It determines the composition and organization of the judiciary&#13;
and manages its affairs without interfering with the independence of the bodies concerned. It determines&#13;
the number of judicial districts and the seats of the regional, district, administrative and appeal courts on&#13;
the basis of a proposal by the Minister of Justice and Ã¢&#128;&#147; as regards military courts Ã¢&#128;&#147; in coordination with the&#13;
Minister of Defense.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.      The structure of the prosecution office corresponds to that of the courts and the Prosecutor&#13;
General oversees the legality and provides methodological guidance to all other prosecutors. The&#13;
prosecution office has to ensure that legality is observed by leading and supervising investigations. It may&#13;
also conduct investigations.&#13;
&#13;
6.      The Chairman of the Supreme Court of Cassation, the Chairman of the Supreme Administrative&#13;
Court and the Prosecutor General are appointed and removed by the President of the Republic upon a&#13;
proposal from the SJC for a period of seven years. The Judicial Systems Act sets forth the structure and&#13;
operational principles of judicial system bodies, the interaction among them, as well as that among judicial&#13;
system bodies and the legislature and executive ones.&#13;
&#13;
7.     Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria were approved at first reading on&#13;
September 23, 2015. The Constitutional amendment provides for a division of the Supreme Judicial Council&#13;
into two Chambers - a judicial chamber and a prosecutors' chamber - each responsible for the&#13;
administration of the respective professions.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Draft amendments to the JSA, prepared but not submitted to the National Assembly, contain the&#13;
following provisions: division of the SJC into two Chambers - judicial and prosecutorial; direct election of&#13;
SJC members by General Assemblies of judges and of prosecutors and investigators; increase in the self-&#13;
governance of courts through increasing the functions of the general assemblies of judges; changes to the&#13;
disciplinary proceedings in order to guarantee impartiality and independence; improvements to the&#13;
attestation of magistrates in order to ensure just and transparent career growth; providing a procedure for&#13;
SJC approval in order to indict a magistrate; development of the professional qualification of magistrates;&#13;
clear and predictable rules on secondment of magistrates - decisions should be made by the general&#13;
assemblies of courts and not - as the practice currently stands - by court chairs; increasing the&#13;
independence of individual prosecutors; improving the work of SJC's Inspectorate; and introducing E-&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      13&#13;
&amp;#12;justice. This package of amendments would allow Bulgaria to meet the goals of its Updated Justice Sector&#13;
Reform Strategy, discussed below, and responds to European Commission assessments and&#13;
recommendations for strengthening BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s justice system, particularly by separating the administration&#13;
of judges and prosecutors within the SJC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          II.       Justice Sector Reform Strategy&#13;
&#13;
9.       The Council of Ministers adopted an Updated Strategy to continue judicial sector reforms by a&#13;
resolution dated December 17, 2014, which was subsequently approved by the National Assembly on&#13;
January 21, 2015. The overall objective of this Strategy is to build on the efforts to modernize the judiciary&#13;
and to complete its reform within the next seven years. In doing so, Bulgaria will rely upon the resources&#13;
and opportunities arising from its membership of the European Union and the Council of Europe, as well&#13;
as upon the maturing of civil society and the professional community. The Strategy aims to: achieve&#13;
effective independence of the courts and the judiciary; ensure good governance of the judicial authorities&#13;
and their highly effective functioning; unfold the potential of human resources in the judiciary and&#13;
guarantee the high motivation, competence and social responsibility of judges, prosecutors and&#13;
investigating magistrates; implement a modern and effective criminal policy through the necessary&#13;
institutional and regulatory reforms; ensure a full-fledged right to a fair trial for each citizen and effective&#13;
protection of human rights. Once fully implemented, the Updated Strategy will ensure European standards&#13;
of justice to natural and legal persons and turn the judiciary into an effective guarantor of the Rule of Law&#13;
and the strengthening of State governance and institutions in the country.&#13;

&#13;
10.     Data on the performance of the Judiciary over the past 7 years is presented in ANNEX 1: Case&#13;
Disposal and Workload between 2008-2014, which gives the number of pending cases at the beginning of&#13;
the year, number of incoming cases, number of resolved cases, number of resolved cases within 3 months&#13;
and number of pending cases at the end of that year for each court. It also presents the estimation of&#13;
caseload per judge per month, on the basis of the number of cases heard and resolved; and on the basis&#13;
of the number of approved judge positions and the actual number of working judges. Table 1 presents the&#13;
performance of the judiciary in terms of case-disposition for 2014.&#13;

11.      Table 1 demonstrates good performance in terms of Ã¢&#128;&#156;clearance rate percentageÃ¢&#128;&#157;4 and Ã¢&#128;&#156;calculated&#13;
disposition timeÃ¢&#128;&#157;5, both of which are internationally recognized indicators of courtsÃ¢&#128;&#153; efficiency. A Clearance&#13;
Rate close to 100 % indicates the ability of the court or of a judicial system to resolve more or less as many&#13;
cases as the number of incoming cases within the given time period. A Clearance Rate above 100 %&#13;
indicates the ability of the system to resolve more cases than received, thus reducing any potential backlog.&#13;
Conversely, a Clearance Rate below 100 % indicates that the number of incoming cases is higher than the&#13;
number of resolved cases, thus increasing any potential backlog of cases.&#13;
&#13;
12.     The Disposition Time indicator provides further insight into how a judicial system manages its flow&#13;
of cases. Generally, a case turnover ratio and Disposition Time compares the number of resolved cases&#13;

  The assessment team was unable to clarify whether the three-month period referred to in the official court statistics is uniformly measured&#13;
across courts from the date of filing of the case or from the date of the last court hearing. However, these are official statistics published in&#13;
government websites.&#13;

14.     The Clearance Rate for all cases in all Bulgarian courts has been close to 100 % in all of the past 7&#13;
years and the Disposition Time has been less than or just above 75 days for all the years except 2008. In&#13;
2014, the Clearance Rate was 102% and the estimated Disposition Time was 72.69 days, both of which will&#13;
be considered very good performance in comparison to other European countries.&#13;
&#13;
15.      In comparison with other member states of the Council of Europe (CoE),6 Bulgaria comes out quite&#13;
well when looking at the parameters of Clearance Rate and Disposition Time based on the latest publication&#13;
of judicial statistics from CEPEJ7 (using 2012 data):&#13;

16.    Table 3 shows that with respect to non-criminal cases, BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s Clearance Rate was fairly close to&#13;
the average of CoE states. However, in terms of Disposition Time, Bulgaria was much better than the&#13;
average and median for the EU states.&#13;

 Georgia had 0 cases at the start of the year, and had 18,437 incoming cases in 2012. It resolved 18,425 cases, leaving&#13;
only 12 pending cases at the end of the year. This makes disposition time very close to zero days as per the definition&#13;
of the term.&#13;

19.     Thus, on the whole, taking all kinds of cases into consideration Ã¢&#128;&#147; whether criminal or non-criminal&#13;
- BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s performance in terms of efficiency of courts is on par with CoE states in respect of clearance&#13;

maximum number of judges working per court is 25 in Appellate Courts, which is followed by 21 in District&#13;
Courts, and 18 in Regional Courts in District Centers. The lowest number of judges working per court is 4&#13;
found in the Regional Courts located outside of district centers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
    The actual number of total working judges increased to 2,030 by the end of year, i.e. December 31, 2014.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                        21&#13;
&amp;#12;22.      Whether this wide difference is justified or not will have to be examined from the perspective of&#13;
average caseload per working judge. The workload of a judge is based on the number and types of cases&#13;
s/he hears. The number of resolved cases per judge is a parameter of his/her efficiency. Column (9) shows&#13;
the caseload based on number of cases heard per working judge. According to the above information, the&#13;
overall caseload per working judge is 30.2 cases per month. However this varies from the lowest 2.4 cases&#13;
per month in Military Courts to 59.2 cases per month in the Regional Courts in District Centers, including&#13;
the Sofia Regional Court, the largest court in Bulgaria. Apart from the Military Courts, the caseload appears&#13;
to be relatively low in Appellate Courts (8.5 cases per judge per month) and District Courts (15.5 per judge&#13;
per month). BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s overall average caseload compares well with the average caseload per judge per&#13;
month in the neighboring countries such as Romania (39.3), France (38.1), Greece (23.0), Serbia (30.2), and&#13;
Ukraine (27.3).&#13;
&#13;
23.     From the above analysis, the following conclusions emerge:&#13;
&#13;
        1) Appellate Courts: There are 147 judges working in 6 Appellate Courts. On average, there are&#13;
           25 judges per court and they are hearing only 8.4 cases and resolving 7.1 cases per month. It&#13;
           is not clear how such a large number of Appellate Court judges can be justified in view of the&#13;
           number of cases being heard and resolved per judge. One explanation for the high number of&#13;
           judges in Appellate Courts is that lower-level judges may need to be promoted after some&#13;
           years of service and therefore, they move up to higher courts such as the Appellate Courts.&#13;
           However, the caseload in Appellate Courts does not appear to justify the present number of&#13;
           judges or the growth in these judges through promotions based on seniority alone.&#13;
&#13;
        2) Military Courts: There are 19 judges working in 4 Military Courts. The caseload per judge is&#13;
           only 2.4 cases per month. This does not justify the number of judges in the 4 courts. It seems&#13;
           likely that 1 Military Court with 2 judges could manage the existing caseload10.&#13;
&#13;
        3) District Courts: There are 623 judges working in 29 District Courts with an average of 21 judges&#13;
           per court. Their caseload is only 15.5 cases per month. This is low compared to the national&#13;
           average and even if half of these judges were redeployed to other courts, the caseload would&#13;
           not exceed the national average of 30 cases per month per judge. Considering District Courts&#13;
           have been established as per the administrative jurisdictions of the respective districts, it is&#13;
           likely more difficult to reduce their number. However, there is potential for redeploying at&#13;
           least 300 judges working in these courts to courts with higher caseloads. With regard to district&#13;
           courts, Sofia City Court deserves special attention. Even though it has 152 approved judicial&#13;
           positions (including judges and junior judges), only 119 judges were actually working at the&#13;
           court as of December 31, 2014. The caseload of these judges in 2014 was 46.6 cases per&#13;
           months, which is three times higher than the national average for district courts. It would be&#13;
           advisable to redeploy judges from other district courts to Sofia City Court to fill the available&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
  The MOJ informed the Bank team that it believes that Bulgaria does not need a separate military court system&#13;
because this is a remnant from a time when the country had a huge professional army. MOJ believes that general&#13;
courts could easily handle crimes committed by military personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     22&#13;
&amp;#12;            approved positions, in order to reduce caseload to levels commensurate with other courts of&#13;
            the same category.&#13;
&#13;
        4) Regional Courts in District Centers (including Sofia Regional Court): There are 484 judges&#13;
           working in 27 Regional Courts located in District Centers with an average of 18 judges per court.&#13;
           However, these courts have the highest caseload of 59.2 cases per judge per month. If a&#13;
           number of judges working in District Courts were redeployed to these Regional Courts, the&#13;
           average caseload per judge could be reduced to a more manageable level. This redeployment&#13;
           would not necessarily lead to a dislocation of judges as District Court judges could continue to&#13;
           work in the same district. Again, the biggest court in this category, Sofia Regional Court, is an&#13;
           outlier. Of the 171 approved positions for magistrates in Sofia Regional Court, 13 positions&#13;
           have not been filled yet and another 20 magistrates have been seconded to other courts. The&#13;
           actual caseload of judges in this court in 2014 was 124.4 cases per month, which is&#13;
           approximately twice the workload of judges in regional courts in district towns and almost four&#13;
           times the workload of other regional courts. In order to reduce this caseload, the Sofia Regional&#13;
           Court should be fully staffed and judges from this court should not be seconded elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
        5) Regional Courts: There are 314 judges working in 86 Regional Courts at an average of 4 Judges&#13;
           per court. However, the caseload in these courts is 33.37 cases per judge per month, which is&#13;
           not substantially high. However, there may be scope for redeploying judges to these courts to&#13;
           reduce the caseload further.&#13;
&#13;
        6) Administrative Courts: There are 226 Judges working in 28 Administrative Courts at an average&#13;
           of 8 judges per court and the caseload is 20.26 cases per judge per month. Both the number&#13;
           of judges and their average caseload are moderate in comparison to other types of courts in&#13;
           Bulgaria. These courts do not require intervention in terms of redeployment.&#13;
&#13;
24.     It may be noted, however, that all the analysis above is based on the simple number of cases and&#13;
that we do not have data on the types or complexity of cases that each level of Bulgarian courts may hear.&#13;
The SJC is currently conducting an exercise to classify each case-group by the Ã¢&#128;&#156;complexity" involved in&#13;
resolving them. Conclusions regarding the appropriate number of judges and manageable levels of&#13;
caseload for each type of Bulgarian court could be revised after considering the outcome of the SJCÃ¢&#128;&#153;s&#13;
complexity exercise. A detailed description of the last seven years of judicial workloads by category of court&#13;
is presented in ANNEX 2: Court-Wise Actual Workload between 2008 and 2014.&#13;
&#13;
25.     It will be pertinent to note that among the District Courts, the following ones in particular have&#13;
sustained low caseloads since 2010:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
26.      Table 6 shows 13 out of total 28 District Courts where the average case load has been consistently&#13;
low since 2010. These courts have an average caseload of less than 10 cases per working judge per month,&#13;
and the caseloads have further declined in the last 3 years. The average case load of these 13 courts is&#13;
about half the average of all District Courts. These courts have, on an average, approximately 21 judges&#13;
per court. Some of those judges could be redeployed to Regional Courts located in the same district towns&#13;
or to District Courts with significantly heavier judicial caseloads such as Sofia City or other Regional Courts&#13;
with high judicial caseload like Sofia City, Varna, Pernik, and Plovdiv. Any redeployment of judges will not&#13;
be easy and may be complicated by the fact that some Districts Courts likely have judges who are senior to&#13;
those in the regional courts and therefore less willing to move Ã¢&#128;&#156;downÃ¢&#128;&#157; to a Regional Court. Nevertheless,&#13;
in the interest of overall efficiency of judicial system, the SJC may need to identify a solution to the existing&#13;
unbalanced distribution of workload across the District Courts. One possible solution could be to protect&#13;
the salary and rank of District Court judges while redeploying them to Regional Courts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                      24&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
28.     Table 7 above shows 6 Regional Courts which have a consistently low caseload of less than 20 cases&#13;
per judge per month. This amounts to less than one case per day for each judge. This is a low average in&#13;
comparison to other Regional Courts. The average of these 6 courts is less than half of average of all&#13;
Regional Courts in the same years. Based on this assessment (which does not account for variations in the&#13;
complexity of the cases that are heard in each court), the current number of judges working in these 6&#13;
courts may not be justified. Surplus judges could be transferred to other courts, or if the number of judges&#13;
in the concerned courts is low, these courts could be consolidated with other Regional Courts based on&#13;
geographical proximity.&#13;

30.      Table 8 shows that the number of professional judges per 100,000 inhabitants in Bulgaria was 23.7&#13;
in 2006, which was close to the average of 20.3 for the CoE states. However, after 2006, there has been a&#13;
consistent increase in the number of professional judges per 100,000 inhabitants in Bulgaria and it reached&#13;
30.7 in 2012, whereas the average for CoE states increased minimally and remained at a level of 21 judges&#13;
per 100,000 inhabitants. The evolution in the number of professional judges per 100,000 inhabitants in&#13;
Bulgaria between 2006 and 2012 has been 29.6 % which is substantially higher than the average growth of&#13;
4.2 % for the COE states.&#13;
&#13;
31.     Bulgaria is experiencing a demographic crisis, with negative population growth since the 1990's&#13;
and an economic stagnation that has promoted significant emigration. Bulgaria's population is now&#13;
shrinking at an alarming rate, losing 582,000 in ten years, and 1.5 million since 1985. Bulgaria has an&#13;
estimated population of 7.11 million in 2015, which is down from the official population of 7.36 million at&#13;
the 2011 census. (There are also significant Ã¢&#128;&#156;pullÃ¢&#128;&#157; factors that also have influenced this recent emigration.)&#13;
However, the number of professional judges increased from 2,147 to 2,225 between 2011 and 2015. The&#13;
number of professional judges per 100,000 population in 2015 is 31.3. The evolution between 2006 and&#13;
2012 has been 32.1 %. The contrast of a shrinking overall population with the increase of almost 32% in&#13;
number of judges per 100,000 inhabitants is striking.&#13;

  The changes in number of judges in UK-Northern Ireland appears to be an outlier. Data for UK-Northern Ireland&#13;
needs to be qualified by the fact that data reported for 2006 and 2008 includes the number of lay judges (243) and&#13;
seems to be presented in terms of Ã¢&#128;&#156;personsÃ¢&#128;&#157; rather than Ã¢&#128;&#156;full time equivalentsÃ¢&#128;&#157; as reported by other COE states.&#13;

32.     Table 9 shows that there was an increase in the number of incoming cases from 2008 to 2010. But&#13;
there has been a continuous decline in the number of incoming cases since 2011. If these caseload figures&#13;
are compared to the increase in the number of professional judges per 100,000 inhabitants to 31.3 in 2015&#13;
we see that the number of judges in Bulgaria grew despite a reduction in population and a reduction in the&#13;
number of incoming cases. (Though it should be noted that the absolute number of incoming cases in 2012&#13;
and even in 2014 was still greater than in 2008 for all of BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s courts except the Military Courts.) This&#13;
analysis can be used to support the case for establishing a freeze on the number of approved judgesÃ¢&#128;&#153;&#13;
positions and redeploying existing working judges based on the distribution of caseload.&#13;
&#13;
33.     Digging deeper into the judicial statistics we can assess the evolution in the number of judicial&#13;
positions from 2008 to 2014 to see in which category of courts it has increased the most:&#13;

34.      Table 10 shows that the maximum proportionate increase in the number of judicial positions has&#13;
been in the Appellate Courts. This is followed by Regional Courts in District Centers. This is as expected,&#13;
since, as the judges get promoted, they likely move Ã¢&#128;&#156;upÃ¢&#128;&#157; the court hierarchy and ultimately are posted in&#13;
Appellate Courts. In Regional Courts in district centers, there is the maximum caseload and it is expected&#13;
that the number of judges would be increased to match the increasing caseload. The increase in District&#13;
Courts has been 4.44 %, but in relation to the caseload in these courts, this may be considered high. As&#13;
suggested earlier, this growth could have been to provide promotional avenues to judges in the Regional&#13;
Courts. A reduction of 7.44 % in the number of judges in Regional Courts, is, however, not justified because&#13;
these are first instance courts with caseloads that are greater than the average. A reduction of 19.35 % in&#13;
Military Courts is to be expected due to reducing caseload.&#13;
&#13;
35.      If we compare the number of courts per 100,000 inhabitants in Bulgaria and other COE member&#13;
states, the situation emerges as follows:&#13;

&#13;
36.     In many European countries, planned or current reforms to the judicial map tend to reduce the&#13;
number of courts with the aim of cutting budgets or increasing efficiency by grouping courts together or&#13;
making them more specialized. This applies to Croatia and Serbia in the above list of countries. Similar&#13;
types of reduction or consolidation of courts could be justified in Bulgaria based on the declining&#13;
population, downward trend in incoming cases, growth in the number of judges and uneven distribution&#13;
of caseload among different court levels.&#13;
&#13;
37.      The caseload analysis in the sections above was conducted based on the actual number cases filed&#13;
and resolved in courts as per statistics published by the SJC. However, (as noted above in paragraph 24)&#13;
these statistics do not distinguish between the complexities of different types of cases. All cases are not&#13;
equally complex. Some cases raise a number of difficult issues, involve multiple parties or address novel&#13;
legal issues and therefore require greater effort from a judge to understand and resolve. Other cases, such&#13;
as the issuance of enforcement orders and writs of execution, can be resolved in minutes. In order to&#13;
incorporate this additional characteristic in its statistics, the SJC has developed a methodology for&#13;
measuring the complexity of cases.&#13;
&#13;
38.      Under this methodology, administrative cases have been divided into 50 groups and criminal and&#13;
civil cases have been divided into 100 groups. Judges have been asked to fill out questionnaires specifying&#13;
how many hours they typically need to devote to a case from each group. Once the information from all&#13;
these questionnaires is processed, SJC will determine a Ã¢&#128;&#156;Complexity QuotientÃ¢&#128;&#157; for each case group, which&#13;
will form the basis of the case weighing methodology. A survey of judges across Bulgaria was started in July&#13;
2014 and concluded in March 2015. Questionnaires were completed by judges and uploaded electronically&#13;
to the central server. Processing of survey results is ongoing. The entire set of results is expected by end of&#13;
August 2015. The questionnaire cards were entered on a retrospective basis, but in the future can be&#13;
entered on real time basis. Time Control Sheets will have to be entered by judges in the electronic system.&#13;
The electronic system will enable the monitoring of complexity of cases on a real time basis. The SJC should&#13;
have the ability to track the Ã¢&#128;&#156;complexity quotientÃ¢&#128;&#157; by court/case type and arrange the cases in ascending&#13;
or descending order of complexity. This exercise will help in assessing the caseload in different courts more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              29&#13;
&amp;#12;accurately by more effectively incorporating complexity into the assessment. If adopted by the SJC in 2015,&#13;
the results will be available for use in preparing budget estimates for the courts starting in 2017.&#13;
&#13;
39.     There is a risk that the judges (and possibly the SJC) will identify more time needed to handle a&#13;
particular type of case than it actually takes them to resolve the case. Thus the SJCÃ¢&#128;&#153;s Complexity Quotient&#13;
could have an upward bias to it. This has been observed in another sector in Bulgaria where an assessment&#13;
of complexity tended to move in the direction of more rather than less complexity when measured by the&#13;
participants. At the same time the SJCÃ¢&#128;&#153;s efforts could provide a useful benchmark against which court&#13;
workloads can be measured going forward. Such measurements could help the SJC reallocate caseload&#13;
among different courts in a more refined manner based on complexity and could be used to develop a&#13;
more fair evaluation of judges.&#13;

                                        VI.      Investigation Magistrates&#13;
&#13;
40.      Investigation magistrates also form part of the judiciary. More than 1,000 investigation magistrates&#13;
were appointed during 1999-2005, of which about 500 have either retired or become prosecutors. There&#13;
are still approximately 500 investigation magistrates, approximately 80 of which work at the National&#13;
Investigative Service (NIS). Many of them do not have sufficient workload, especially the ones working at&#13;
NIS. Thus, the average caseload per investigation magistrate at the National Investigative Service in 2013&#13;
was estimated to be 11.89 cases, of which 5.79 cases have been completed and just 0.56 have ended with&#13;
an opinion for bringing an indictment to court12. Unfortunately current data on investigation magistratesÃ¢&#128;&#153;&#13;
workload was not publicly available. Anecdotal evidence suggests that workload may have dropped further&#13;
since 2013. As per Constitutional provisions, these magistrates can exit only through retirement; they&#13;
cannot be removed from service unless there is a disciplinary ground. Based on available information, the&#13;
government may consider conducting a detailed examination of the potential and actual workloads for&#13;
these magistrates in order to make a decision on the optimal number needed to handle the expected&#13;
caseload.&#13;
&#13;

                                          VII.     Secondment Program&#13;
&#13;
41.     Court presidents have the authority to temporarily transfer judicial assistance between the courts.&#13;
The assistance is based on an assessment of the workload in the receiving court. Both the sending and&#13;
receiving court presidents must agree on the transfer of judicial assistance. The funds to pay for the salaries&#13;
of the temporary judge are reallocated through the SJC. If the judge is temporarily assigned to a higher&#13;
level court, the salary of the judge is increased to the level of the higher level judge position. Only salary&#13;
funds are transferred to the receiving court. No provision is made for the additional travel or other&#13;
incidental costs. Once the assignment is complete, the seconded judge returns to the resident court and&#13;
the salary is reduced to the level of the original, lower resident court.&#13;

&amp;#12;43.      Based on Tables 12 and 13 it appears that backlogs continued to fall even in those courts that&#13;
experienced a net loss of judges due to secondments. The one exception were the District Courts which&#13;
experienced both a net loss in judges and an increase in backlog. While we cannot draw specific&#13;
conclusions from this data (for example would the backlog in the Regional Courts have fallen more if these&#13;
courts did not have a net loss in seconded judges?), we can conclude that the secondment program will&#13;
result in an increased caseload burden for the judges remaining in courts that experience a net loss of&#13;
seconded judges. For example, the Regional Court in Sofia seconded 21 judges to other courts and received&#13;
7 seconded judges, resulting in a net reduction of 14 judges which contributes to the high caseload carried&#13;
by the judges remaining in the Sofia Regional Court. The length of secondment service has been as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                                   Table 14: Length of Secondment Service&#13;
&#13;
                  Over 36 Months       Over 24 months            Over 12 Month      Under 12 Months&#13;
&#13;
                          21                    17                     24                  52&#13;
&#13;
44.     The above table indicates that some of the secondments have become de-facto permanent re-&#13;
assignments. In the category of secondments with a duration of more than 36 months, some judges have&#13;
been on assignment for more than 60 months and in one case, for more than 80 months. Based on this&#13;
data, the SJC may consider reviewing the list of seconded judges to determine those that should be placed&#13;
permanently in vacant positions in the receiving courts.&#13;
&#13;
45.       The secondment program can be used by the SJC as a valuable tool to address the workload of&#13;
judges in overburdened courts. However, the SJC should consider restructuring the secondment program&#13;
as it is currently administered Ã¢&#128;&#147; through agreement of the sending and receiving Court Presidents Ã¢&#128;&#147; for it&#13;
to make more effective use of this tool. Under a revised secondment procedure the SJC could assume&#13;
responsibility for deciding the placement of seconded judges based on a work load analysis conducted by&#13;
the SJC.&#13;
&#13;
46.     The above arrangement would eliminate both the perception of favoritism in the assignment of&#13;
some judges to higher courts (with an accompanying increase in wages) and the possibility of Court&#13;
Presidents influencing the decisions of seconded judges who would like to remain in their seconded&#13;
positions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        VIII.    Support Staff in Judiciary&#13;
&#13;
47.     The SJC is developing a court reorganization strategy by studying court closure alternatives and the&#13;
impact those closures would have on access to justice. Following that study, the SJC plans to estimate the&#13;
number of support staff needed in relation to the workload. The present ratio of support staff to judges is&#13;
as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                                   Table 15: Ratio of Support Staff to Judges&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            32&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
48.      The current ratio of support staff to Magistrates is 2.52. However, this ratio is not uniform across&#13;
courts. It will be useful to ensure that this ratio is equitably applied within each court. There are several&#13;
courts that do not have an adequate number of support staff, which can affect the courtÃ¢&#128;&#153;s efficiency. It&#13;
may be possible to have a redeployment of support staff from courts with higher ratios to courts with lower&#13;
ones. It would also be helpful for the SJC to analyze if a ratio of 2.52 clerks to each judge is necessary for&#13;
the efficient delivery of judicial services. If not, and if the ratio can be reduced to 2 while maintaining the&#13;
same level of outputs and judicial services, then the number of clerks could be reduced to around 950&#13;
which could result in an annual savings of approximately 17.5 million BGN.&#13;

&amp;#12;49.      As can be seen, the ratio of staff to judges falls into three groups. There are three countries with&#13;
ratios of 3.7 or more, four countries with ratios between 3 and 3.2 and four countries with ratios of 2.6 or&#13;
2.7 and one country with a ratio of 2.1. Bulgaria falls in the middle with a ratio of staff to judges of 2.6.&#13;
&#13;
50.     The ratio of staff to inhabitants is the highest in the highly developed EU countries; Germany and&#13;
Sweden all have over 50 staff per 100,000 inhabitants. Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia and Slovenia (all&#13;
former Yugoslav republics, not listed) also each have well over 30 staff and judges per 100,000 inhabitants.&#13;
The rest of the Eastern European countries have ratios of staff and judges to 100,000 inhabitants ranging&#13;
from a high of 29 in Bulgaria to a low of 11.7 in Albania. The ratio of both staff and judges in all of the&#13;
Eastern European countries are very similar. The three other EU members, Italy, Netherlands and France,&#13;
have substantially less staff per 100,000 inhabitants ranging from 2.6 to 3.7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         IX.      Expenditure Framework for the Judiciary Sector&#13;
&#13;
51.     The Public Finance Act, 2014 assigns the responsibility for the budget formulation process and&#13;
timetable to the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The SJC follows the Budget Instructions issued by the MOF&#13;
that are applicable to all Primary Budget Holders. The SJC is the Primary Budget Holder for the judiciary.&#13;
The courts are considered Secondary Budget Holders. The instructions and budget schedules to be&#13;
completed by the courts are issued by January 31 of each year. The budget call circular requests the&#13;
Primary Budget Holders to estimate their budget requirements for two years into the future. All budget&#13;
proposals including from the Judiciary and the Parliament are approved by the Council of Ministers.&#13;
&#13;
52.      The SJC sends budget instructions to the courts requiring the courts to prepare their budget&#13;
proposals using the standard budget classification for all government bodies. The standard classification&#13;
is by economic object class of expenditures (Salaries, Social Security, Travel, Maintenance, etc.). The courts&#13;
submit their budget proposals to the SJC as email attachments. The analysts in the SJCÃ¢&#128;&#153;s Directorate of&#13;
the Budget and Finance Sector consolidate all 185 budget proposals by court type and submit the budgets&#13;
to the Budget and Finance Committee of the SJC for review.&#13;
&#13;
53.     There are two sources of funding for the judiciary budget Ã¢&#128;&#147; Own Revenue and State Subsidy. The&#13;
courts estimate the level of court fees to be collected during the fiscal year based on the expected number&#13;
of incoming cases and their types. An estimate is also made in regard to the amount to be collected through&#13;
penalties based on cases under consideration and past trends. The estimated level of fees to be collected&#13;
during a year is linked to the tariff-rates approved by the Council of Ministers. Once the SJC approves the&#13;
Judiciary budget including estimated expenditure, Own Revenue, and State Subsidy, it is sent to the&#13;
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) for presentation to the Council of Ministers.&#13;
&#13;
54.      Article 117 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria makes the following provision in respect&#13;
of the judiciary:&#13;
&#13;
         Ã¢&#128;&#156;(1) The judiciary shall protect the rights and legitimate interests of all citizens, legal entities and&#13;
         the State.&#13;

&amp;#12;55.     The Judiciary is guaranteed an independent budget to ensure its independence from the executive.&#13;
The Budget for the judiciary is, therefore, not amended by MOJ or the Council of Ministers. The Council of&#13;
Ministers consolidates budgets of all ministries, departments and agencies and forwards them to the&#13;
Parliament for approval. Table 17 below illustrates the significant reduction to the judicial budget request&#13;
as proposed by the MOF and adopted by the Parliament for inclusion in the State Budget Act.&#13;

56.     Traditionally the MOF submits an alternate budget for the judiciary to Parliament. The alternate&#13;
budget is always lower than the budget proposal from the SJC. This is typically due to the fact that the&#13;
MOF considers broader resource constraints and tries to allocate the budget rationally and equitably based&#13;
on these broader constraints. Since the parties running the executive branch are also in control of the&#13;
Parliament, the Parliament usually approves MOFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s alternate budget proposal for the judiciary. As a result,&#13;
the annual State Budget Act has included the MOFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s alternative budget rather than the budget proposed&#13;
by SJC.&#13;
&#13;
57.     After the State Budget Act is approved, the SJC distributes an annual allocation of funds to courts&#13;
by economic classification along with an approved employment ceiling. The court presidents have the&#13;
authority to reprogram funds among the various classes of expenditures with approval of the SJC.&#13;
&#13;
58.     The courts manage their budget within the approved funding level. All court expenditures are&#13;
transmitted to the SJC electronically for prior approval. Courts cannot incur any expense without prior&#13;
authorization from the SJC. This practice is uniformly followed across all government agencies where&#13;
secondary budget holders are required to take prior authorization for all expenditures from the primary&#13;
budget holders. Courts maintain their own accounting records and submit monthly accounting reports to&#13;
the SJC. The reports are consolidated by the SJC and are subject to certification by the Bulgarian National&#13;
Audit Office.&#13;

&amp;#12;61.     Figure 1 shows that Expenditure has been higher than the originally approved budget in all years&#13;
except in 2009, when the investigative function was transferred from courts to the police. The average&#13;
budget execution during this period has been 106%, which was largely covered by the supplementary&#13;
budgets passed in these years.&#13;

&#13;
63.      Table 19 shows that the annual budget allocation per inhabitant for Courts is 17.1 Euros in Bulgaria&#13;
against the average for CoE states of 34.8 Euros. For the entire Judicial System, comprising of Courts, Public&#13;
Prosecution and Legal Aid, the annual budget allocation per inhabitant in Bulgaria is 29.5 Euros, in&#13;
comparison to the average for CoE states of 60.6 Euros. Bulgaria thus provides a lower absolute budget&#13;
allocation (per inhabitant) for its judicial system in comparison to the average of CoE member states.&#13;
&#13;
64.        In terms of GDP per capita, the BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s budget allocation to the judicial sector is as follows:&#13;

&#13;
65.     Table 19b shows that BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s annual budget allocation as a percentage of GDP per capita is&#13;
higher than a rich country like Norway and lower than a poor country like Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;
BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s allocation to its courts and judicial system on a GDP per capita basis is also above the COE&#13;
averages. In fact only four COE states spend more on their judicial systems relative to GDP per capita than&#13;
Bulgaria (Bosnia, Montenegro, Serbia and UK-N. Ireland). It is important to note that Bulgaria receives&#13;
large scale assistance to strengthen rule of law from EU and other international organizations. As a result,&#13;
the annual budget allocation may be higher than what it would have otherwise been.&#13;
&#13;
66.      A benchmarking of BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judicial budget in comparison to other EU member states in relation&#13;
to GDP is presented in ANNEX 3: Benchmarking of Per Capita State Budget and % of GDP with COE Member&#13;
States. This benchmarking reveals that BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judicial budget allocation as a percentage of GDP is&#13;
second at 0.46%; only Slovenia spends more as a percentage of its GDP on the judiciary (0.53%). The&#13;
benchmarking also shows that Bulgaria is dedicating almost 26 euros per capita for the operation of the&#13;
judiciary compared to an average of over 50 euros per capita for EU Member States. Of the newer EU&#13;
Member States, only Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia are spending more per capita than Bulgaria.&#13;
The rest of the former Eastern European countries are spending similar amounts as Bulgaria on their&#13;
judicial system.&#13;

&amp;#12;   68.    Table 20 shows that the judiciary is currently funding 27 % of its expenditure from its own sources,&#13;
   whereas the Government is funding 73 % through its subsidy. If we compare court fees with respect to&#13;
   expenditure on courts, the court fees cover 49 % of court expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
   69.      Currently the judiciary is experiencing a reduction in filings which in turn reduces the collection of&#13;
   filing fees. The level of filing fee collection was reduced from a high of 124,009,000 BGN in 2011 and has&#13;
   declined almost each year since to its current level of 105,578,000 BGN in 2014. This is a reduction of&#13;
   18,431,000 BGN or almost 15% over four years. It is anticipated that the amount of filing fees collected will&#13;
   continue to fall in succeeding years (matching the trend of decreasing intake of new court cases).&#13;
&#13;
   70.      The SJC is proposing a restructuring of filing fees that will increase revenue in future years. Under&#13;
   this proposal, some fees would be increased to reflect the actual work being performed by the courts. For&#13;
   example, some fees for administrative cases and privately filed criminal cases are low based on the level&#13;
   of judicial effort and could be increased.13 On the other hand, the 4% proportionate fee charged in civil&#13;
   cases based on the amount of monetary interest can become extremely high in high-value cases and may&#13;
   deter some claimants from making claims or cause them to file only partial claims. Therefore, the SJC has&#13;
   proposed introducing a ceiling to this fee.&#13;
&#13;
   71.      The SJC has submitted the revised court fee plan to the Council of Ministers, through the Deputy&#13;
   Minister of Finance, over the past few years for submission to Parliament. (The Council of Ministers is the&#13;
   only government body authorized to propose legislation to the Parliament.) The Council of Ministers has&#13;
   yet to act on the SJCÃ¢&#128;&#153;s fee proposal. A revision of BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s court tariffs is overdue. The SJCÃ¢&#128;&#153;s proposal&#13;
   should be reviewed and evaluated based on its impact on access to BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s courts as well as its revenue&#13;
   raising impact.&#13;

     Some judges believe raising the filing fees on some administrative and privately filed criminal cases will have the&#13;
   added benefit of leading to a reduction in frivolous filing allowing more time for judges to review other cases.&#13;
&#13;
   14&#13;
      This covers the actual budget approved by the Parliament. There were Supplementary Budgets approved&#13;
   thereafter, for which the break-down by administrative or economic classification is not available.&#13;

   73.      Table 21 shows that there has been a modest 2.8 % per annum rise in the budget funding for the&#13;
   judiciary sector between 2008 and 2015. There was a reduction in the budget in 2010 due to the transfer&#13;
   of the investigation function to the police department. The judiciary was left with investigations of higher&#13;

were transferred to the Prosecution in 2010.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
75.      Figure 2 shows that 51 % of the judicial budget is for the courts, 39 % for the prosecution, and 10&#13;
% for all other judicial institutions. The Supreme Court of Cassation and Supreme Administrative Court&#13;
together have an allocation of 5 % of the judicial budget. The Supreme Judicial Council and the Inspectorate&#13;
under it together have an allocation of 4 % of the judicial budget. The National Institute of Justice has an&#13;
allocation of 1 % of the judicial budget. The budget expenditure follows the same trend.&#13;
&#13;
76.      The budget execution for the different administrative classifications described in Figure 3 and Table&#13;
22 is as follows:&#13;

&#13;
15&#13;
   The investigators under the District ProsecutorsÃ¢&#128;&#153; offices can investigate any crimes that are assigned to them by the respective district&#13;
prosecutors, however, usually the more complex crimes go to them. The investigators at the National Investigative Service investigate, according&#13;
to the Judicial System Act, cases with special factual or legal complexity, crimes committed abroad, requests for legal assistance from foreign&#13;
countries, as well as other cases specified in law.&#13;

 77.      Table 22 shows a budget execution by the Supreme Judicial Council that has been consistently low&#13;
 each of the last three years. The SJC has been unable to spend almost 45-50 % of its budget. The SJC should&#13;
 carefully assess its capacity to spend as it prepares future budgets. The highest budget execution by&#13;
 percentage is that of the National Institute of Justice on a consistent basis. Therefore, the Institute also&#13;
 should more accurately assess its needs during its budget preparation. The execution of the judicial budget&#13;
 exceeded the amounts in the State Budget Act for all years with the exception of budget year 2009. The&#13;
 Council of Ministers ordinances dealing with the judiciaryÃ¢&#128;&#153;s budget for the period 2008 Ã¢&#128;&#147; 2014 were&#13;
 examined to determine if the judiciary received supplemental funds. There were a number of decrees&#13;
 approved for 2013 and 2014 and only one decree approved in the three prior years. The National Audit&#13;
 Office confirmed that the additional judicial expenditures were authorized.&#13;

 79.     From Table 23, it may be noted that the budget was classified only into current and capital&#13;
 expenditures from 2012 onwards; the breakdown of current expenditures into salaries, social security,&#13;
 other remuneration and payments and expenses for maintenance was not included in the budget. This&#13;
 gave more flexibility to the judiciary to use its current budget allocation based on its specific needs each&#13;
 year. The distribution of judicial budget into current and capital expenditures has been as follows:&#13;

 80.     The Capital Budget has been significantly low. One of the reasons is that the Capital Budget&#13;
 requests submitted by the SJC are not approved in the Budget voted by the Parliament. This is described&#13;
 in Table 24.&#13;

&#13;
81.      The table shows that a very small proportion of the capital budget requests of the judiciary are&#13;
included in the Budget Act. This leads to lack of resources for the judiciary in regard to modernization. Since&#13;
2007 the Ministry of Justice is responsible for the capital assets of the judiciary and these funds form part&#13;
of MOJÃ¢&#128;&#153;s budget. Since 2009 the Judicial System Act specifies that this responsibilit y extends only to&#13;
immovable capital goods such as court buildings. The change appears to not have impacted SJCÃ¢&#128;&#153;s ability to&#13;
get more funds for movables, i.e. it continuously appears to get insufficient funds. The responsibility over&#13;
capital budget was moved to MOJ because the judiciary was not doing a very good job of managing it. The&#13;
main negative effect of separating the responsibility over movable and immovable properties has been&#13;
that currently the judiciary pays for ordinary repair and MOJ pays for capital repair. Therefore, there have&#13;
been arguments over how to characterize individual repair works, which has led to their postponement.&#13;
&#13;

judicial expenditure by economic classification is presented below.&#13;

&#13;
86.     From Table 26, it is clear that budget execution been more than 100 % since 2010 and in six of the&#13;
past seven years. The average budget execution during 2008-2014 has been 106 %. The average budget&#13;
execution of current expenditure has been 106 % and that of capital expenditure has been 89 %. The&#13;
execution percentage for Ã¢&#128;&#156;other remunerationÃ¢&#128;&#157; was exceptionally high during 2010 and 2011. The&#13;
breakdown of budget execution for the current budget is not available for 2012-2014 as the budget itself&#13;
did not provide this detail.&#13;
&#13;
87.    The execution of the Capital Budget in 2013 was 58 % while in 2014 it was 165 %. Both of these&#13;
were exceptional. The high capital budget execution in 2014 was due to the completion of building&#13;
construction in Sofia. Expenditure in excess of the originally approved budget is usually done with prior&#13;
approval of the Ministry of Finance, in the form of Supplementary Budgets.&#13;
&#13;
88.     The Ministry of Justice has the responsibility for managing the property of the judiciary; the funds&#13;
for construction and complete refurbishment of real estate; and for property entailed obligations, i.e.&#13;
taxes, fees, rent16. The Table 27 shows the funding approved in the State Budget Act and actual&#13;
expenditures for judicial facilities.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
89.     The general tendency to under-execute the capital budget demonstrates the complexities involved&#13;
in new space acquisition and major renovation projects. Most of the issues, if not all, are outside the control&#13;
of the MOJ.&#13;
&#13;
90.      The SJC has a minimal capital budget of its own to be used for minor space maintenance and repair&#13;
projects. Some of these minor capital expenditure projects have resulted in disagreements with the MOJ&#13;
as to which monies should be used for the project. This is one of the reasons why the MOJ is considering&#13;
proposing that the SJC assume responsibility for all space acquisition, major renovation as well as the minor&#13;
maintenance and repair projects for which it is already responsible. The proposal for the SJC to manage&#13;
the buildings was part of the draft amendments to the Constitution of Republic of Bulgaria approved at&#13;
first reading in September 2015.&#13;
&#13;
91.       Considering that salaries are a major component of BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judicial budget, a benchmarking with&#13;
other COE member states has been done as shown in ANNEX 4: Benchmarking of Salaries of Judiciary&#13;
with other CoE states. It is evident from Annex 4 that both gross wages of a Supreme Court judge and a&#13;
first instance judge in Bulgaria are lower than in most other CoE states. The only country paying a lower&#13;
wage than Bulgaria is Albania. However, the ratio of gross wages of a judge in comparison to the gross&#13;
average wage is one of the highest in Bulgaria, and is second only to Romania.&#13;
&#13;
92.    The following provisions of the Judicial Systems Act provide for a minimum salary for magistrates&#13;
and judges:&#13;
&#13;
        Ã¢&#128;&#156;Article 218 (1). The chairpersons of the Supreme Court of Cassation and of the Supreme&#13;
        Administrative Court, the Prosecutor General and the Director of the National Investigation&#13;
        Service shall have a basic monthly remuneration equal to 90 percent of the remuneration of the&#13;
        chairperson of the Constitutional Court.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       48&#13;
&amp;#12;        (2) The basic monthly remuneration for the lowest judicial, prosecutorial or investigating&#13;
        magisterial position shall be set at the double amount of the average monthly salary of&#13;
        budget-funded employees, based on data of the National Institute of Statistics.&#13;
        (3) Remunerations for other positions at judicial system bodies shall be set by the Supreme&#13;
        Judicial Council.&#13;
        Article 219. On top of the basic monthly remuneration, judges, prosecutors and investigating&#13;
        magistrates shall be paid additional remuneration for extended work as a judge, prosecutor and&#13;
        an investigating magistrate at the amount of 2 percent for each year of service record, not to&#13;
        exceed 40 percentÃ¢&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
93.     The salary of civil servants was enhanced in 2012, but there was no equivalent increase in the salary&#13;
of magistrates and judges. Accordingly, about 20 % of judges and magistrates are receiving less than the&#13;
salary prescribed under the above provisions of the Judicial Systems Act. This has led to hardships and&#13;
resentment among judges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
94.     Performance of the Judiciary: The performance of judiciary in terms of case disposition has been&#13;
quite satisfactory. The clearance rate in Bulgarian courts has been close to 100 % in all of the past 7 years&#13;
and the disposition time has been less than 75 days for all years except 2008, both of which can be&#13;
considered good performance in comparison to other European countries.&#13;
&#13;
95.      Judicial Staffing and Workloads: There are 2,225 approved judge positions, against which, 1,811&#13;
judges are working. The average actual caseload per judge per month at the national level is about 30.&#13;
There are several courts with very low caseloads. As a result, there is scope to redeploy surplus judges to&#13;
other courts with high caseloads. At the national level, however, there does not appear to be a need to&#13;
increase the total number of working Judges. As an initial step in the judicial restructuring process, the SJC&#13;
could consider reducing the number of approved judge positions to the number of currently filled positions&#13;
(1,811). Further restructuring, including possibly additional reductions in judicial positions, could then be&#13;
based on a more refined analysis of workloads and case complexity.&#13;
&#13;
96.     Support Staff Levels: The ratio of staff to inhabitants in Bulgaria is 2.7, which is one of the highest&#13;
in Eastern European countries. However, staffing is not uniform across courts. The SJC should consider&#13;
reducing the ratio at the national level (thereby contributing to cost-savings) and uniformly distributing the&#13;
revised national ratio across courts (thereby improving efficiency).&#13;
&#13;
97.     District and Regional Courts Workloads: There is scope for the judiciary to reorganize itself to&#13;
improve its efficiency and effectiveness based on an assessment of judicial workloads.17 There are presently&#13;
13 district courts where the caseload per judge is less than 10 cases per month. Similarly, there are 6&#13;
regional courts where the caseload is 20 or fewer cases per judge per month. Both of which are well below&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17&#13;
  For this study the World Bank has only measured the number of cases per court and per judge and has not assessed&#13;
the complexity or the types of cases that are handled in different courts in Bulgaria. A deeper analysis of case&#13;
complexity could result in different conclusions.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       49&#13;
&amp;#12;the average for each type of case. It is likely that the number of judges in these courts can be reduced with&#13;
some judges freed to be redeployed to other courts where there are higher caseloads. Surplus judges in&#13;
district courts could be redeployed within regional courts located in the same district centers to avoid any&#13;
discomfort due to re-location18. In addition, regional courts with low caseloads could be consolidated with&#13;
other regional courts or they could be retained as territorial units of other, larger regional courts.&#13;
Considering that there are only about 4 judges in regional courts on average, redeployment of judges to&#13;
other courts may not be appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
98.     Appellate Courts: There are 147 judges working in 6 appellate courts (including 1 Appellate Military&#13;
Court). On average, there are 25 judges per court who each hear only 8.4 cases per month and resolve only&#13;
7.1 cases per month. It may be difficult to justify this level of appellate court staffing given the existing&#13;
caseload. The SJC should consider consolidating the 6 appellate courts into 2 or 3 appellate courts and&#13;
redeploy surplus judges elsewhere, so that the average appellate caseload per judge is around 25 cases&#13;
per month Ã¢&#128;&#147; closer to the overall average of 30 cases per judge per month for all BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s courts.&#13;
&#13;
99.     Military Courts: There are 19 judges working in 4 military courts. The caseload per judge is only&#13;
2.4 cases per month. It is likely difficult to justify the existing number of military judges given the caseload.&#13;
One court with 2 judges could manage the existing caseload. The SJC should consider consolidating 4&#13;
military courts into a single military court to handle the existing caseload. Surplus judges could be&#13;
redeployed elsewhere, if needed. Alternatively, the SJC, MOJ and military leadership could consider&#13;
moving all military cases into the general courts and closing the military court system as suggested by the&#13;
MOJ.&#13;
&#13;
100. Investigation Magistrates: the average caseload per Investigation Magistrate at the National&#13;
Investigative Service in 2013 was estimated to be 11.89 cases, of which 5.79 cases have been completed&#13;
and just 0.56 have ended with an opinion for bringing an indictment to court. This is very low workload and&#13;
even lower indictment rate. According to the Ministry of Justice, this caseload has declined further since&#13;
2013. The government should carefully examine the potential workload for these magistrates and decide&#13;
how many are required to do the job at hand. The surplus judges could be redeployed elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
101. Options for Surplus Judges: In view of the analysis and conclusions in this paper, a number of&#13;
judges may be determined to be surplus because the SJC may not be able to identify suitable places for&#13;
their redeployment. However, under Bulgarian law, judges cannot be removed from service except by way&#13;
of attrition. Hence, the government may want to consider options to allow these judges to retire or&#13;
redeploy within the government as alternative exit routes to changing the law.&#13;
&#13;
102. Secondment of Judges: At present, there are about 114 judges seconded to other courts through&#13;
agreements between the court presidents. There are two major issues regarding the current&#13;
administration of the program: the appearance of favoritism in the assignment of judges to higher courts&#13;
with associated increase in wages and the possibility of court presidents influencing the decision of those&#13;
seconded judges who want to maintain their secondment assignment. To address these issues the SJC&#13;
should consider terminating the secondment program as it is currently administered by the court&#13;
presidents and assume direct responsibility itself for deciding the placement of seconded judges. The SJCÃ¢&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18&#13;
 It is acknowledged this could considered as demotion by some judges. Hence, the pay and title must be protected.&#13;
On the other hand, it may be possible for example to redeploy judges from other District Courts to Sofia City Court.&#13;
&#13;
                                                        50&#13;
&amp;#12;decisions should then be based on a careful and detailed analysis of workloads across BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s courts and&#13;
the circumstances under which full-time vacancies have been generated from the termination of&#13;
magistrates on any of the grounds listed in Article 165 of the Judicial Systems Act, i.e., tendering of&#13;
resignation, disciplinary termination, etc. In the event of such circumstances, secondment of magistrates&#13;
may remain the most expedient manner of swift and effective resolution of workload issues.&#13;
&#13;
103. Under-Funded Judicial Budget Request: Despite high judicial expenditures in relation to its per&#13;
capita GDP (based on comparison with EU and neighboring countries), Bulgaria has underfunded its&#13;
judiciary in relation to the SJCÃ¢&#128;&#153;s budget request and the statutory required minimum salaries for judges.&#13;
Ninety-eight percent of BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s judicial budget is for current expenditure, the majority of which is for&#13;
salaries and other remuneration. However, current budget levels are insufficient to pay even the minimum&#13;
salary for magistrates prescribed under law. The capital budget is also not adequate to meet judicial needs&#13;
as only about 10-15 % of the judiciaryÃ¢&#128;&#153;s capital budget requests are approved by the Parliament. The low&#13;
execution rate for the capital budget had been of a concern until 2013, but in 2014, the execution rate for&#13;
the Capital Budget reached 165 %.&#13;
&#13;
104. Judicial Restructuring and Cost Savings: In light of the funding uncertainty faced by the judiciary&#13;
and the opportunities for restructuring the judicial system identified in this paper, it may be possible for&#13;
the SJC, MOJ and MOF to reach agreement on a medium term funding strategy for the judiciary. Such an&#13;
agreement could be based on a judicial restructuring plan that leads to a more efficient court system with&#13;
a more equitable distribution of workload (by redeploying judges, consolidating courts, and shrinking&#13;
judicial and staff positions as necessary) that can be fully funded (both current and capital expenditures)&#13;
without resort to annual debates over supplemental budget requests. Given the overall costs, it is&#13;
recommended that a proportion of any savings from judicial restructuring be used to finance increases in&#13;
salaries and higher capital expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
105. Court Fee Structure: There is a scope for the judiciary to increase its own revenues by reforming&#13;
and raising filing fees. For a number of years, the SJC has submitted proposals to the Council of Ministers&#13;
seeking support to submit a revised court fee structure to Parliament for approval. The Council of Ministers&#13;
has not acted on the SJC proposal. A revision of the tariff is overdue and the SJC proposal should be&#13;
evaluated based on its impact on access to BulgariaÃ¢&#128;&#153;s courts and on the court systemsÃ¢&#128;&#153; revenue raising&#13;
capacity. In the determination of the revised court fee structure, it would be necessary to strike a balance&#13;
between the need to boost own revenues in the judiciary budget and the right of access to justice for&#13;
citizens and legal entities.&#13;
&#13;
106. Predictability of Government Subsidy: The judiciary has raised concerns that any economies&#13;
realized through reduced costs or increased income that it is able to achieve through judicial restructuring&#13;
would result in the reduction of the governmentÃ¢&#128;&#153;s subsidy to the judicial budget leaving overall&#13;
expenditures at their present insufficient level. These concerns have been aggravated by the latest State&#13;
Budget Act which for the first time provided that if the judiciary fails to reach the budgeted levels of its&#13;
own income, the state budget subsidy would not be raised to compensate any shortfall. It is noteworthy,&#13;
however, that in its Decision No 4/2015, the Constitutional Court declared this provision of the State&#13;
Budget Act to be contrary to the Constitution and would therefore not be implemented. The SJC would like&#13;
greater predictability in the resources they receive from the government budget so that they can undertake&#13;
necessary reorganization and restructuring of the courts and judiciary with confidence that they will have&#13;
access to sufficient resources to manage a restructured judicial system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    51&#13;
&amp;#12;107. Preparing Medium-Term Budget as Per Plans of Judiciary: It is recommended that SJC prepare a&#13;
medium-term Action Plan based on the Justice Sector Reform Strategy approved by the Council of&#13;
Ministers in December 2014 and approved by National Assembly in January 2015. The Action Plan could&#13;
then be used to develop the judiciaryÃ¢&#128;&#153;s medium term financial requirements. The medium term financing&#13;
plan could incorporate the minimum salary for judges and other judicial officials as prescribed under law.&#13;
It also is recommended that the judiciaryÃ¢&#128;&#153;s full capital budget needs in reference to their modernization&#13;
plan are included in the financing plan. The medium term financing plan could account for any funding&#13;
expected to be received from the EU or other international organizations for judicial modernization. The&#13;
judiciaryÃ¢&#128;&#153;s spending should be aligned to the performance of its functions. A realistic medium-term budget&#13;
forecast should be based on an analysis of the spending efficiency in the system and tied to plans for the&#13;
achievement of the goals defined in the Judicial Reform Strategy. It is also recommended that the Ministry&#13;
of Justice and Ministry of Finance review this medium term financing framework and have an open&#13;
discussion with the SJC in order to reach consensus on a stable funding plan.&#13;
&#13;
108. One option that a number of Latin American countries have used to increase the predictability in&#13;
government funding to the judiciary is linking the government subsidy to the judicial budget to GDP. If all&#13;
the parties can agree on a formula for sufficient and consistent government subsidies to the judicial budget,&#13;
then this could help to build trust between the judiciary and the Government and motivate the former to&#13;
reform. However, this linkage does not appear to have any impact on judicial performance, including the&#13;
length of court processes.19 In addition, earmarks make the budget allocation process more rigid. They&#13;
undermine allocative efficiency by preventing the government from moving resources to meet changing&#13;
needs; they may reduce technical efficiency by undermining managerial incentives; and there is a risk of&#13;
such earmarks proliferating.&#13;
&#13;
109. Decentralization of Expenditure Decisions: Presently courts must receive prior authorization from&#13;
the SJC for every expenditure that they make from the budget, while every fee that a court receives is&#13;
transferred to the SJC. Court presidents cannot retain any funds or take any expenditure decisions on their&#13;
own. The SJC could consider allowing court presidents to retain some percentage of the fees that their&#13;
courts collect. Considering that some courts collect fees to a significantly lesser extent in comparison to&#13;
their maintenance requirements, SJC could use the pool of fees collected to address the needs of resource-&#13;
deficient courts. The objective of this recommendation is to empower courts to use a portion of their&#13;
collected fees for the maintenance and development of their respective courts. The SJC could match this&#13;
decentralization of authority with specific rules defining the object and method by which court presidents&#13;
could use those funds and providing procedures for holding court presidents more accountable for the use&#13;
of these retained funds. Also, a results agreement could be signed between the SJC and court presidents&#13;
at the beginning of the year and the latter made accountable for results.&#13;

Bulgaria is dedicating almost 26 euros per capita for the operation of the judiciary compared to over an&#13;
average of over 50 euros per capita for all EU Member States. Of the new Member States Hungary, Poland,&#13;
Slovakia and Slovenia are spending more per capita than Bulgaria. The rest of the former Eastern European&#13;
countries in the EU are spending similar amounts as Bulgaria on their judicial system.&#13;

It is evident from Table that both gross wages of a Supreme Court judge and a first instance judge in Bulgaria&#13;
are lower than most of other EU member states. The only country paying a lower wage to its judges than&#13;
Bulgaria is Albania. However, the ratio of gross wages of a judge in comparison to the gross average wage&#13;
is one of the highest in Bulgaria and it is second only to Romania. So relative to local Bulgarian workers,&#13;
Bulgarian judges are well paid.&#13;
