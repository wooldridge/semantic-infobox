                    The Water and Sanitation Program                 April 2008&#13;
                    is an international partnership for&#13;
                    improving water and sanitation sector&#13;
                    policies, practices, and capacities to&#13;
                    serve poor people                                Info Note&#13;
&amp;#12;Clean streets, clean localities, clean marketsâ&#128;¦ this is what most people look for from an&#13;
efficient solid waste management system. Not much thought is given to where the waste has&#13;
gone once it is out of sight. In other words: out of sight, out of mind! In India, currently over 80&#13;
percent of the municipal solid waste generated is dumped out in the open. At current&#13;
estimates, that is almost 100,000 tons being added to our environment every day, and it is&#13;
responsible for serious public health and environmental concerns including soil, water and&#13;
air pollution, and accidents such as fire explosions, aeroplane crashes,1 and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What are the Impacts of Open Dumping?&#13;
â&#150;    Water pollutionâ&#128;&#148;Surface and groundwater bodies can get contaminated by leachate2&#13;
    and hazardous substances released from the dumpsite. Potable groundwater may become toxic.&#13;
â&#150;    Soil pollutionâ&#128;&#148;Toxic substances released into the soil are absorbed by surrounding vegetation and move into&#13;
    the food chain.&#13;
â&#150;    Dump firesâ&#128;&#148;When waste decomposes at dumpsites, methane is released; this gas is inflammable and can result&#13;
    in explosions or dump fires. The smoke from such fires contains toxic substances and is inhaled by the&#13;
    surrounding populace.&#13;
â&#150;    Global warmingâ&#128;&#148;Methane released from dumpsites is one of the main contributors to global warming.&#13;
â&#150;    Source of diseaseâ&#128;&#148;Dumpsites breed flies, rodents, and pests which carry diseases into the surrounding&#13;
    population.&#13;
â&#150;    Other impactsâ&#128;&#148;Foul smell; visual ugliness; bird menace which can be a hazard to aeroplanes.&#13;
&#13;
The primary goal of any solid waste management system is to safeguard public health and the environment. This&#13;
is achieved by ensuring proper collection, transportation, recycling or processing and, finally, safe disposal of&#13;
waste. The last step is lacking in most solid waste management systems implemented across the country.&#13;

 Improper storage of waste, especially hazardous waste, could lead to accidental spills, thereby increasing the risk of fires or explosions. Flight safety is&#13;
affected because the garbage also attracts birds, increasing the risk of bird-hits and aeroplane crashes.&#13;

 Leachate is a toxic liquid that seeps through solid waste in a landfill and, in the process, extracts soluble dissolved and suspended materials from the&#13;
waste. It contains waste, bacteria, toxic substances, heavy metals, among other things. In towns where biomedical or hazardous waste (for instance,&#13;
batteries, bulbs, thermometers) mixes with the municipal waste stream, the leachate can cause serious health and environmental damage.&#13;

 Landfill gas contains methane and carbon dioxide plus small amounts of some other gases. Methane being inflammable can cause fires or explosions.&#13;
Accordingly, at most secured landfills this gas is collected and either burnt in a controlled manner or used to generate electricity. The gas is released over&#13;
a long period of time as the waste degrades. Consequently, gas emissions from landfill sites must be monitored for many years even after the sites have&#13;
stopped accepting waste.&#13;

            India - Secured landfills : the bucket at
            the end of the solid waste management chain
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In India, currently over 80 percent of
            the municipal solid waste generated is dumped out in the
            open. At current estimates, that is almost 100,000 tons
            being added to our environment every day, and it is
            responsible for serious public health and environmental
            concerns including soil, water and air pollution, and
            accidents such as fire explosions, airplane crashes, and so
            on. This document describes the characteristics and
            advantages of a secured landfill. It begins by describing
            the consequences of open dumping, then lays out the
            definition and components of a secured landfill. It presents
            the justifications for having one, and lays to rest the
            objections that might arise.
