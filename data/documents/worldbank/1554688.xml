FOREWORD&#13;
Centrally planned economies (CPEs) account for a significant share of&#13;
the world's production and income.    In view of their importance in the world&#13;
economy, and to facilitate international comparative analysis, for many years&#13;
the World Bank has included statistical data on these countries in those of&#13;
its publications that aim for universal coverage, such as The World Bank&#13;
Atlas.   Among these data, those relating to gross national product (GNP) and&#13;
to GNP per capita are the most important, and the Bank also needs them for&#13;
operational purposes for its member countries, which now include some CPEs.&#13;
In the CPEs prices are generally set administratively and are often&#13;
loosely or not at all related to the relative scarcity and costs of production&#13;
of goods and services.    This is particularly true of the exchange rate.    The&#13;
World Bank normally uses exchange rates for converting GNP figures from&#13;
national   currencies  into   dollars   (or  into  any   other  numeraire),   an&#13;
indispensable   step  for   international  comparisons.     The  choice   of  an&#13;
appropriate conversion factor therefore poses particularly difficult problems&#13;
for most CPEs.   A further difficulty arises because the national accounts of&#13;
the CPEs are based on the concept of net material product (NMP), which differs&#13;
from the concept of GNP used in market economies.     To derive the GNP numbers&#13;
of those CPEs that compile only NMP accounts, various adjustments must be&#13;
made.   The data required for making these adjustments are not always fully&#13;
available.   Finally, a separate set of issues arises in relation to year to&#13;
year comparisons within the same CPE.      For these too and the corresponding&#13;
growth rates, official data are not strictly comparable to growth rates of the&#13;
market economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In early 1982 a research project sponsored and financed by the World&#13;
Bank was undertaken to assess alternative methods of computing the per capita&#13;
dollar GNP levels and growth rates of CPEs.        It covered eight countries:&#13;
Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary,&#13;
Poland, Romania and the U.S.S.R.    The purpose of this research project was to&#13;
define the best among known methods that could be applied to CPEs as a group&#13;
and make use of available data.     It was not its aim to establish and define&#13;
new computation methods whose application would have required many more years&#13;
of effort, even if data had been available.&#13;
This research project has produced eleven reports, which are&#13;
published   simultaneously.    The  main   report  authored  by   the  principal&#13;
researcher for the project, Paul Marer, is published as a book, Dollar GNPs of&#13;
the USSR and Eastern Europe (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985). The eight&#13;
country studies and two background papers are published separately in the&#13;
World  Bank  Staff Working Paper series.      The main report provides highly&#13;
valuable insights isto the problems related to the estimation and comparison&#13;
of the GNPs and GNP growth rates of the CPEs. It also gives the author's best&#13;
estimates of the actual values of these indicators for the majority of CPEs&#13;
covered by the project, that is those for which there was some statistical&#13;
basis for computing estimates or choosing between those already available.&#13;
The main report on the Research Project on CPEs concludes that&#13;
adequate GNP data in national currencies can be derived for most CPEs by&#13;
adjusting official information about net material product in the light of&#13;
statistical  and other information known to country experts.         It further&#13;
concludes that the best method generally applicable to CPEs for converting&#13;
such GNP data from local currencies into dollars would use conversion rates&#13;
based upon purchasing power parity (PPP) information.       For comparison with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
corresponding World Bank data on other World Bank members, these conversion&#13;
rates should be adjusted to correct for the expected differences between the&#13;
PPP rates and the actual official exchange rates (the "exchange rate deviation&#13;
index"). The needed adjustments are estimated econometrically from the actual&#13;
differences observed at each level of per capita GNP among the thirty-one&#13;
market economies participating in Phase III (1975) of the International&#13;
Comparison Project (ICP).    For Hungary, Romania, and Poland, PPP information&#13;
is derived from Phase III (1975) of the ICP, while for Czechoslovakia, the&#13;
German Democratic Republic, and the U.S.S.R., it is derived from private&#13;
bilateral comparisons chain-linked to the ICP data.       This method yields a&#13;
range of per capita GNP estimates: for example, $2,700 to $5,700 with a&#13;
midpoint of $4,190, for the U.S.S.R. in 1980.    No PPP estimate was available,&#13;
and no GNP per capita figure in US dollars calculated, for Bulgaria and Cuba.&#13;
The main report also concludes that the official estimates of growth&#13;
rates of the CPEs "tend to yield varying degrees of upward bias."        For all&#13;
countries except Hungary, the experts lean toward preferring alternative&#13;
indices, constructed by outside experts with partial information, although&#13;
these too present problems (especially for countries other than the U.S.S.R.)&#13;
and the experts therefore fell short of endorsing them.       The author of the&#13;
study on Hungary leans toward preferring the official index at this time.&#13;
The country studies and background papers that are being issued in&#13;
the World Bank Staff Working Paper series provide additional details on the&#13;
CPEs studied and their exchange rates.     Some of the country studies include&#13;
the respective authors' estimates of per capita GNP in U.S. dollars.       These&#13;
estimates, however, are the individual authors' experimental computations,&#13;
based on methods that may not be consistently applicable to CPEs generally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
There remain major uncertainties about GNP conversions by means of&#13;
"adjusted PPPs."   In addition to numerous remaining theoretical and practical&#13;
problems associated with calculating PPPs within the framework of the&#13;
centrally coordinated ICP, private estimates such as those used in this study&#13;
for three CPEs still appear to be subject to a wide margin of error.&#13;
Furthermore, there is no other way to estimate the exchange rate deviation&#13;
index than to derive it from observation of the countries covered by the ICP&#13;
(almost all of which are market economies).      The applicability of an index&#13;
derived in this fashion to the CPEs, whose economic structures are very&#13;
different, remains subject to reservations.&#13;
The present study used ICP Phase III data relating to the year 1975,&#13;
extrapolated to 1980.    Phase IV ICP data already published shows estimates&#13;
directly relating to 1980 for European countries, including Hungary and&#13;
Poland; Romania,   a participant in early phases of the ICP, has not provided&#13;
the data needed for participation in Phase IV. It is noteworthy that Phase IV&#13;
estimates of Hungary's and Poland's per capita GNP in 1980 are lower than the&#13;
1975 results extrapolated to 1980, used by the Research Report on CPEs. These&#13;
differences are partly due to the greater attention paid in Phase IV to&#13;
quality differences and to other methodological advances.&#13;
During the course of 1983 the Bank, with the help of a distinguished&#13;
panel of experts, 1/ undertook a review of the methodological problems and&#13;
issues related to the estimation of internationally comparable per capita GNP&#13;
figures for all countries. The preliminary results of the research project on&#13;
CPEs constituted an important input into that review, whose findings and&#13;
l/ Abram Bergson, Harvard University, Chairman; Andre Vanoli, Institut&#13;
National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques; and Parmeet Singh,&#13;
Commonwealth Secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
recommendations were approved by the panel of experts.         In light of the&#13;
review, the Bank has decided that for the time being (that is, at least until&#13;
data availability and other problems related to PPP information are resolved),&#13;
official GNP information converted at official exchange rates should generally&#13;
continue to provide the basis of the per capita GNP estimates published in The&#13;
World Bank Atlas.   Exceptions to this rule are to be made only when official&#13;
GNP data, in national currency, is exceptionally bad or compiled in ways which&#13;
diverge in an exceptionally large measure from the usual methods and&#13;
standards, or when the official exchange rate is exceptionally far removed&#13;
from the rate effectively governing foreign payments transactions. When there&#13;
is a reason to believe that such exceptional circumstances prevail, and&#13;
adequate information exists, appropriate adjustments are to be made.        When&#13;
adequate information does not exist and cannot be obtained, no estimates are&#13;
to be published.   At the time of writing this foreword, it seems likely that&#13;
lack of information will for some time prevent the Bank from making estimates&#13;
of the per capita GNP of most CPEs.     Thus The World Bank Atlas published in&#13;
early 1985 contains an estimate of the values of GNP and GNP per capita for&#13;
only one European CPE, Hungary.&#13;
Following the review endorsed by the panel of experts, the World Bank&#13;
has adopted calculation methods and obtained results which, for a few&#13;
countries, are different from those of the research project of CPEs.         The&#13;
Bank's general methodology must be applicable to all its member countries,&#13;
including most market economies and only a few CPEs; the Bank could demand&#13;
that its member countries provide additional information when needed; and it&#13;
could, and did, decide not to estimate the per capita GNP of countries for&#13;
which a minimal, but still fairly extensive set of information could not be&#13;
obtained.   As noted earlier, however, the research project on CPEs has aimed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
at defining a method consistently applicable to all CPEs and one that could&#13;
make use of available information.   These differences in aims and constraints&#13;
readily explain the differences in results.&#13;
The research project on CPEs, whose major findings are published in&#13;
the main report, has greatly enhanced the understanding of the CPEs' unique&#13;
macroeconomic accounting frameworks and pricing systems.       It has provided&#13;
insight into many substantive issues, in particular the relationship of&#13;
domestic and international prices.   The individual country reports, published&#13;
separately, shed much light on many important country-specific issues.      The&#13;
Bank will continue to build upon the valuable findings of the research project&#13;
on CPEs in its future efforts to understand these important components of the&#13;
global economy.&#13;

ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper reviews Bulgaria's national accounts data, and estimates&#13;
the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in national currency for 1970 and&#13;
1980 and the average growth rate of GDP for the period, 1970-80. It also&#13;
examines the role of the official exchange rate in the country and concludes&#13;
that the official exchange rate vis-a-vis convertible currencies is not&#13;

SUMMARY&#13;
This paper reviews briefly Bulgaria's national accounts data, and&#13;
estimates the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in national currency for&#13;
1970 and 1980 and the average growth rate of GDP for the period, 1970-80. It&#13;
also examines the role of the official exchange rate in the country to see if&#13;
it can be used to convert GDP in national currency into U.S. dollars.&#13;
Bulgaria's national accounts data&#13;
Bulgaria compiles regularly the net material product (NMP)&#13;
statistics by industrial origin, expenditure categories and types of primary&#13;
income. However, it publishes NMP only by industrial origin. The published&#13;
data is discontinuous over time: beginning in 1970, the NMP estimates have&#13;
included value-added in passenger transportation, communications serving&#13;
households, processing of agriculture products at home and exploratory&#13;
geological work; and starting with 1977, the estimates of the capital&#13;
consumption (depreciation) have been based on new norms, affecting the&#13;
estimates of NMP total at current market prices.&#13;
Bulgarian methods to estimate NMP for certain sectors differ from&#13;
the "standard" ones for the System of Balances of the National Economy. Among&#13;
them, the method for estimating the contribution of the trade sector may&#13;
introduce a significant bias by including "price equalization taxes or&#13;
subsidies" on internationally traded goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Bulgaria estimates NMP by industrial origin in constant prices, by&#13;
taking the difference between the values of outputs and intermediate inputs as&#13;
evaluated at the base-year prices. A comparison of sectoral NMP indexes with&#13;
the corresponding production indexes over time suggests that the official&#13;
estimates have overstated significantly the "real" growth rate of the trade&#13;
sector (thus NMP growth rate also) for the period 1970-80.&#13;
Estimation of Bulgaria's GDP&#13;
Bulgaria has not published data on outputs and inputs of the "non-&#13;
material" service sectors. It is therefore not possible to estimate the&#13;
country's GDP on the expenditure side: the major components of expenditures,&#13;
i.e. consumption of material goods and services, consumption of non-material&#13;
services net of material inputs used up there, gross fixed investment, changes&#13;
in stocks, exports and imports, are estimated from related official data;&#13;
then, these estimates are added up to GDP. Some of the official data used&#13;
here are unclear about their definitions and coverages. The GDP estimates,&#13;
therefore, are subject to unknown margins of error.&#13;
Estimation of growth rate of Bulgaria's GDP&#13;
To offset the possible bias introduced in the estimates for the&#13;
trade sector, the official estimates of NMP in constant prices are adjusted.&#13;
The average growth rate of the adjusted NMP from 1970 to 1980 becomes lower&#13;
than that of the official NMP estimates. Next, the index of net value added&#13;
for the non-material service sectors is estimated in constant prices, based on&#13;
the employment data. This estimate plus the adjusted NMP index yields an&#13;
estimate of net domestic product index in constant prices. Finally, it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
assumed that the growth rate of the net domestic product estimate reflects&#13;
also that of GDP.&#13;
Role of official exchange rates in Bulgaria&#13;
Bulgaria maintains multiple exchange rates. In addition to the&#13;
official exchange rate applied to the trade settled in convertible currencies,&#13;
there are rates applied to tourists' transactions. Also, there is a special&#13;
rate applied to the trade with other members of the Council for Mutual&#13;
Economic Assistance (CMEA). The official exchange rate vis-a-vis convertible&#13;
currencies is applied to only about one-fourth of the country's total trade.&#13;
Even for the traded goods involved here, the official exchange rate rarely&#13;
links their international prices to the domestic market prices. This is&#13;
because a complex system of subsidies and indirect taxes intervenes in the&#13;
determination of domestic market prices of those traded goods. Therefore, the&#13;
official exchange rate vis-a-vis convertible currencies is not suitable to be&#13;
used for converting national currency GDP into U.S. dollars.&#13;

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS STATISTICS AND EXCHANGE RATES FOR BULGARIA&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.       This paper was prepared based on published statistics and discussions&#13;
with Bulgarian officials on methodological issues. When data were not available&#13;
from official sources, some estimates were made based on related statistics.&#13;
Eventually, these estimates are to be evaluated against data prepared by the&#13;
Bulgarian authorities.&#13;
Net Material Product&#13;
2.       Bulgaria compiles net material product (NMP) statistics by industrial&#13;
origin,  expenditure  categories   and  types  of  primary  income.    Its NMP   is&#13;
determined as the sum of the net income generated in the individual material&#13;
sectors.   Expenditures on NMP are estimated independently, while NMP by primary&#13;
income is derived from the data used for estimating sectoral net value-added.&#13;
Of these data, only NMP by industrial origin (both at current and constant&#13;
market prices) is officially published (Tables 1 and 2).&#13;
3.       There are discontinuities in the published NMP series.       Beginning in&#13;
1970, the NMP has included the value-added in passenger transportation, communi-&#13;
cations serving households, processing of agricultural products at home and&#13;
exploratory geological work.    Further, beginning in 1977, the depreciation of&#13;
capital stock has been estimated by new norms and on the basis of replacement&#13;
values, a change that has affected the NMP estimates /l&#13;
4.       Sectoral NMPs at constant prices are calculated as the differences&#13;
between the values of outputs and intermediate inputs evaluated in base-year&#13;
/1 Since the sectoral NMP is estimated by subtracting the intermediate input&#13;
costs, which include depreciation allowances for capital stocks, from the&#13;
value of gross outputs, the NMP at current market prices in 1977 and there-&#13;
after might have been understated in relation to the NMP series for the&#13;
earlier period.    However, the national statistical, agenc   claI,ms that the&#13;
constant price NMP series have been linked together into a         continuous&#13;
series.&#13;

prices.   For the agricultural sector, the central statistical office evaluates&#13;
the physical outputs and intermediate inputs in base-year prices. For all other&#13;
sectors, the enterprises report their outputs and inputs in base-year prices.&#13;
Then, based on these reports, the central statistical office calculates the&#13;
sectoral NMPs at constant prices.    The indexes of the constant price NMP series&#13;
up to 1962 were calculated at 1957 prices, those for 1963 through 1971 at&#13;
January 1, 1962 prices and those for the years after 1971 at January 1, 1971&#13;
prices.   These indexes have been linked using comparable data in the adjacent&#13;
two series.&#13;
5.       Bulgarian national accounts generally follow the standard concepts and&#13;
definitions recommended for the system of balances of the national economy&#13;
(MPS).    Passenger  transportation   and  communications   serving  households  are&#13;
included  in material    production.    Further,   the  processing  of  agricultural&#13;
products by households and the collection of wild berries, mushrooms and,&#13;
firewood, as well as fishing and hunting, are included in material production.&#13;
6.       Deviations in Bulgaria from the standard MPS practice include the fol-&#13;
lowing: (i) allowances for the wear and tear of roads and bridges are not&#13;
treated as depreciation but as final consumption expenditures; (ii) expenditures&#13;
on exploratory geological surveys are not treated as intermediate expenditures&#13;
but as the value of gross output in the construction sector; and (iii) the gross&#13;
output of foreign trade is compiled by evaluating the balance of foreign trade&#13;
at the domestic prices of imports and exports.      The special practices listed as&#13;
(i) and (ii) will lead to a small overestimation of NMP as compared to that in&#13;
other CPEs that follow the standard MPS.&#13;
7.       The   effects  of   the  special   treatment  of  foreign   trade  is  less&#13;
clearcut.   It depends on the "valuta" trade balance/l and the ratio of domestic&#13;
/1  The "valuta" trade balance means the trade balance that is coverte          i t&#13;
-  domestic currency value from tne roreign currency vaiue using rne oriciai&#13;
exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and international prices for imports or exports ("internal exchange rates").&#13;
When the valuta trade balance is positive and exports are heavily taxed, then&#13;
the country's NMP will be underestimated.        If the "valuta" trade balance is&#13;
negative and imports are heavily subsidized in the domestic market, the&#13;
country's NMP will be overestimated (see Appendix 1).&#13;
Estimation of Gross Domestic Product&#13;
8.       Bulgarian authorities have estimated GDP for 1970 and 1978 but have not&#13;
officially published these estimates.      Neither the breakdown of the aggregate&#13;
GDP estimates, nor the detailed estimation procedure, is available.&#13;
9.       The GDP/NMP ratios as derived from the Bulgarian government's estimates&#13;
are much lower than those for the other European CPEs and those of the estimates&#13;
made by L.W. International Financial Research (LWIFR) (Table 3). Since detailed&#13;
input-output data on the non-material sectors are not available in Bulgaria, it&#13;
has not been possible to evaluate the GDP estimates made by the Bulgarian&#13;
authorities in a systematic manner.&#13;

10.      Bulgaria does publish statistics on trade, consumption and investment.&#13;
The data on consumption include the consumption of goods and services produced in&#13;
the material sectors including materials consumed in the non-material sectors&#13;
which serve individual and community consumption needs.       One major problem for&#13;
estimating GDP is the lack of data on value-added and non-material inputs to&#13;
these  non-material  sectors.    These  were   estimated  here by   subtracting  the&#13;
material consumption of the non-material sectors from the social consumption&#13;
funds and then adding the result to the material consumption to derive total&#13;
consumption.   Finally, GDP was estimated for 1970 and 1980 (Table 4)./l      These&#13;
GDP estimates are based on official data evaluated at market prices.      As these&#13;
are affected by subsidies and indirect taxes, the estimates for GDP, and&#13;
especially those for the components of GDP, are also subject to the effects of&#13;
those price distortions. As such, the GDP expenditure estimates in Table 4 may&#13;
be significantly distorted.&#13;

11.       As mentioned in paragraph 4 above, the statistical office estimates NMP&#13;
at constant prices by evaluating the outputs and intermediate inputs in&#13;
appropriate base-year prices.     The accuracy of the constant price NMP series&#13;
thus depends on having reliable estimates of physical outputs and inputs and&#13;
reliable prices.&#13;
12.      As a preliminary check on the sectoral price indexes, in this study the&#13;
implicit sectoral deflators were derived by dividing the nominal NMP indexes for&#13;
the individual sectors by the relevant constant price NMP indexes. It should be&#13;
noted that the deflators for the industry, construction, trade and communica-&#13;
tions sectors were generally lower in the later part of the 1970s (1977-79) than&#13;
in the early '70s.    The same was true for the overall NMP deflator (Table 5).&#13;
On the other hand, the official indexes of the domestic retail prices showed&#13;
rising trends throughout the 1970s (Table 11).        These seemingly inconsistent&#13;
movements in the NMP deflators and domestic price indexes imply either that the&#13;
volume of intermediate inputs per unit of output increased over time or that the&#13;
increases in intermediate input prices were higher than those for the output&#13;
prices for those sectors during the period. The latter is more plausible, given&#13;
that the government has been trying to maintain stable domestic prices in the&#13;
face of the rising prices for raw materials, most of which have to be imported.&#13;
13.      The above discussion suggests that the apparent anomaly in the movement&#13;
of the NMP deflators reflects shrinking margins for the operating surpluses that&#13;
have  been   included  in  the   estimates  of  nominal   NMP.    This  requires  an&#13;
examination of the physical production indexes.&#13;
14.       Comprehensive statistics on the physical volumes of individual products&#13;
are not available. Thus, it was necessary to compare the official aggregate&#13;
&#13;

individual sectors appear to be within a reasonable range of productivity&#13;
changes, except for the trade sector (Table 6).&#13;
15.      The indexes of the sectoral NMP were also compared with those derived&#13;
by the LWIFR./3    It was found that the LWIFR indexes showed much slower in-&#13;
creases than the NMP indexes did, except for the agricultural sector. The dif-&#13;
ferences between the growth rates of the two indexes were most pronounced for&#13;
the trade and industry sectors (Table 6). Detailed data were not available for&#13;
evaluating these discrepancies.    However, there is strong indirect evidence to&#13;
suggest that the official NMP index for the trade sector is overestimated (see&#13;
paras. 6 above and 16 below).     Further, the official NMP index for the indus-&#13;
trial sector may overstate industrial growth, since the Bulgarian statistical&#13;
agency assumes that the base-year prices are equal to the current year prices&#13;
for new products in estimating NMP at constant prices.      On the other hand, the&#13;
LWIFR index for the industrial sector may understate industrial growth because&#13;
/1 Comparisons of the production indexes for a limited number of individual&#13;
products with the corresponding aggregate production indexes suggest that&#13;
the aggregate indexes are not significantly biased.&#13;
/2 This is because the production indexes are output indexes, while the NMP&#13;
indexes are the indexes for the "real" return on the primary factors of&#13;
production.&#13;
/3  Strictly speaking, these two indexes are not comparable: the LWIFR's is for&#13;
the sectoral value-added which includes depreciation but excludes non-&#13;
material service inputs, while the NMP's is for sectoral net income, which&#13;
excludes depreciation but includes non-material service inputs.&#13;

that index is based on a physical output series which may not have been able to&#13;
incorporate new products.&#13;
16.      The trade sector includes wholesale and retail trade, including inter-&#13;
national trade, and restaurants.     The official NMP index for the trade sector&#13;
shows that the sector's net income in 1980 was more than 5 times that in 1970 in&#13;
"real" terms.   This increase far exceeded that of the domestic retail turnover&#13;
or international trade volume during the period (Table 6)./1&#13;
17.       The overall NMP index also depends on the relative weights given to&#13;
different sectors. The official NMP index is based on the sectoral weights that&#13;
are affected by the different subsidies and indirect taxes included in the&#13;
market  prices   of  different  products.     The  sectoral  weights  thus  may not&#13;
represent the weights based on real resource costs.         The LWIFR derived such&#13;
sectoral weights,   which turned out to be not very much different         from the&#13;
official weights.     In fact, an experiment to compute the average annual NMP&#13;
growth rates using official and LWIFR weighting schemes and sectoral production&#13;
indexes showed that the difference in the weighting scheme did not affect the&#13;
average NMP growth rate significantly (Table 7).&#13;

19.      As mentioned    earlier,  statistics  on  income  generated  in  the non-&#13;
material sectors at constant prices are not available.       However, data on the&#13;
number of non-private employed persons in the non-material sectors are&#13;
available.   Considering that the non-material service activities of the private&#13;
sector (e.g., barbers and hairdressers) are not very significant compared to&#13;
those in the non-private sector (e.g., health and education), the net income of&#13;
the non-material sectors in 1970 was extrapolated for other years, using the&#13;
index of the number of non-private employed persons in the non-material sector.&#13;
/1 See Appendix 3 for further details.&#13;

trade volume represented the trade sectors' NMP index.&#13;

The Exchange Rate&#13;
21.      Bulgaria maintains multiple exchange rates not only with respect to&#13;
different types of transactions, but also with respect to different payment&#13;
zones. For example, in August 1982, the official exchange rate was $1.00 = leva&#13;
(Lv) 0.96; the tourist rate for convertible currencies was $1.00 = Lv 1.44; and&#13;
the black market rate was generally quoted at $1.00 = Lv 2.88. In addition, the&#13;
duty-free shops were selling some local products; however, the exchange rate&#13;
could not be derived because the prices were set directly in US dollar terms&#13;
(although it did seem closer to the tourist rate).&#13;
22.      The exchange rate quotations of the National Bank of Bulgaria, as of&#13;
August 1, 1982, are shown in Table 10.        None reflects the real price of the&#13;
Bulgarian leva.    The only firm conclusion that can be drawn is that tourists&#13;
from the CMEA countries received a smaller amount of leva for their currencies&#13;

than the official    exchange rate indicates (negative premium),       whereas  the&#13;
reverse was true for tourists from the hard currency countries (positive premium&#13;
of 50%).    However,  the rates clearly imply that the official exchange rate&#13;
overvalues the leva against the convertible currencies.&#13;
23.      The official exchange rate is an accounting price.      Van Brabant aptly&#13;
points out that in the CPEs, "the exchange rate bears no relationship with&#13;
reality, is not actually utilized in economic transactions whenever it can be&#13;
avoided, and has been largely confined to the role of a uniform bookkeeping&#13;
unit."/1&#13;
24.      Bulgaria's trade is predominantly with the CMEA countries.       In 1980,&#13;
for example, the CMEA countries accounted for 75% of its external trade, the&#13;
developed market economies for 16%, and the developing countries for 9%. Trade&#13;
with the developing countries is mostly on the basis of hard currency - only a&#13;
small fraction of trade is on a bilateral clearance basis.         Trade with the&#13;
developed market economies is also mostly on the basis of hard currency. During&#13;
the last 10 years, this trade has increased tenfold, but is now running into&#13;
snags because, among other reasons, of problems of market access to the European&#13;
Community.&#13;
25.      Trade with the socialist countries, one-half of which is with the USSR,&#13;
is bound by long-term agreements.     Reference trade prices within the CMEA for&#13;
transferable ruble transactions are negotiated every year on the basis of a&#13;
five-year average of international prices.     Actual prices are negotiated bila-&#13;
terally and, in the case of manufactured goods, may to some extent reflect the&#13;

cost of production in the exporting country.        Trade adjustments cleared in&#13;
convertible currencies are usually based on current world prices.&#13;
26.      The volume and commodity composition of trade are largely independent&#13;
of the exchange rate.     The balancing of trade among the CMEA countries takes&#13;
place on the basis of a "transferable" ruble.       These balances are taken into&#13;
account in early negotiations, and no effort is made to accumulate or decumulate&#13;
transferable rubles.    Initial agreements aim at the most optimal exchange of&#13;
goods to meet the needs in each country, with an effort to balance the exchange.&#13;
27.      The  exchange   rate  against  convertible  currencies  fluctuates   on  a&#13;
monthly basis, but this does not affect internal prices.      The goal of domestic&#13;
policies is to maintain a stable internal price through a complex system of&#13;
subsidies and taxes at various levels.     Thus, even the general price reform in&#13;
1980 did not affect the exchange rate (Table 11).      To offset the effect of the&#13;
overvalued national currency, subsidies are given at the production level for&#13;
exports, whereas variable rates of taxes are imposed on imported goods.       Thus,&#13;
actual import prices may well not be reflected in domestic prices in a&#13;
particular year.&#13;
28.      The  tourist exchange   rate appears to perform as a positive policy&#13;
instrument even though it is determined by the State and not by the market.&#13;
However, if merchandise trade, and thus Bulgaria's comparative advantage, is to&#13;
be exploited as a potential source of economic growth, more effective exchange&#13;
rates will need to be substituted for the current official rates, which serve&#13;
merely as a bookkeeping device.&#13;

The gross output (T) of foreign trade is estimated as follows:&#13;
(Ib   Is) + (Ea - Eb) - (Ib - Eb) + (Ea       a Y&#13;
where     Ia and Ea - The value of imports and exports converted into domestic&#13;
currency by means of the official exchange rate and&#13;

Note: Personal consumption includes the material inputs used for business travel and&#13;
recreational and cultural facilities provided for employees. However, in the UN&#13;
standard national accounts system, these items are treated as intermediate inputs&#13;
rather than as a consumption item. To this extent, personal consumption is&#13;
overestimated. However, this ovetestimation is assumed to be cancelled out by the&#13;
exclusion of the value-added and non-material inputs associated with recreational and&#13;
cultural facilities and also the consumption of imputed housing services from own-&#13;
occupied dwellings.&#13;

PRICE FORMATION IN BULGARIA&#13;
Price policies in Bulgaria are an integral part of the planning,&#13;
production and distribution process.     The basic object is to execute the plans&#13;
in as stable an environmtent as possible.&#13;
The basic prinh::iples governing the formation of prices are:&#13;
(i) The pric(a structure should conform with economic and social&#13;
policies.    Prices should stimulate backward branches of the&#13;
economy and should help stabilize people's real income.&#13;
(ii)  Internal prices should be in accord with international prices,&#13;
but shcould be stable.&#13;
(iii)  Prices should serve as a tool for the management of economic&#13;
policies.&#13;
Indigenous Goods&#13;
The baseline for the price of a product is the cost of its&#13;
production, define!d basically as the average full labor cost per unit of&#13;
output in Bulgarigi.  The following principles govern the setting of producer&#13;
and consumer priceBs.&#13;
The wholesale price = the cost of production + overhead + storage +&#13;
packaging + transportation + gross profit of the wholesale sector (for own&#13;
use and for cenl:ralized use) + turnover tax (for some goods).       The retail&#13;
price differs fi:om the wholesale price by the retail profit margin, retail&#13;
overhead, possibly packaging and transportation, and net subsidies or&#13;
indirect taxes.&#13;
The turnover tax that is applied to consumer goods at the retail&#13;
level is fundamnentally similar to the indirect taxes in mXarket economies,&#13;
although they Lre not normally ad valorem.    The incidence of this tax varies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
from product to product.   If the state wishes to rest:rain the consumption of&#13;
a good, it imposes a larger turnover tax. If social ,policy so requires, the&#13;
turnover tax may be zero or even negative (e.g., on goods for children and&#13;
the aged and on medicine). There is no turnover tax orm modern machinery and&#13;
equipment from abroad, although a tax may be imposedi when the imported&#13;
production  technology  is backward.     If  there  are  slhortages,  or  if  an&#13;
industry is faced with structural problems, the state su,bsidizes production;&#13;
for example,   the production of coal or other energy       resources  is being&#13;
subsidized to stimulate domestic production.    Similarly, 1oreservation of the&#13;
environment is subsidized, as are segments of a partictular sector.         For&#13;
example, in agriculture, if the state wishes to stimultate output in a&#13;
particular mountain region where production costs are higher than average, a&#13;
subsidy is given.     Social projects - nurseries, kindergarten schools and&#13;
foreign  students  from developing   countries - are also     subsidized.   The&#13;
subsidies are financed from the turnover taxes and central profits.&#13;
Imported Goods&#13;
The price system varies as follows:&#13;
(i) The producer goods price = the price converted kit the official&#13;
rate + customs duties + transport + profit marginr;&#13;
(ii)  The raw material price = the price converted       at the office&#13;
rate + turnover taxes.    Internal prices are kept stable at a&#13;
five-year moving average so that the costs of enterprises are&#13;
kept stable.   Depending upon the variation betwe(Bn the actual&#13;
price and the norm, subsidy may be given or a tax applied;&#13;
(iii)  The consumer goods price = the price converted at the official&#13;
rate + customs duties + indirect taxes if domes;tic goods of&#13;
the same type are also taxed + additional taxies based on&#13;
social policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
The producer price structure is revised every five to eight years.&#13;
At that time, the turnover taxes, centralized profits and subsidies are&#13;
defined after compiling a list of products whose production needs to be&#13;
stimulated.    The average   international  prices   are used as a base.      An&#13;
experimental price revision was enacted in January 1980, and a full price&#13;
one in January 1982.      Prior to that time, revisions were instituted in&#13;
January 1962 and January 1971.&#13;
Wage Determination&#13;
Wages and salaries are an integral part of the social welfare&#13;
process. They are set under the following set of principles:&#13;
(i) Wages and salaries should assure the normal reproduction of&#13;
life.&#13;
(ii) Wages should correspond to the character, quality and quantity&#13;
of labor.&#13;
(iii) The average wage is based on social productivity in the nation&#13;
as a whole.&#13;
(iv) For teachers, government employees and the like, the salary&#13;
corresponds to working time, education and managerial level.&#13;
(v)  A man-hour   productivity   bonus  is provided   in certain   pro-&#13;
fessions, mainly in agriculture and manufacturing.&#13;
Salaries and wages are the main part, but not the only part, of&#13;
money income.    Salaries and wages guarantee about 80% of consumption needs;&#13;
the rest comes from social consumption funds - centralized as well as&#13;
decentralized.    The latter pay for social services and are financed out of&#13;
the profits of enterprises, turnover taxes, etc.&#13;

            National accounts statistics and exchange
            rates for Bulgaria

            This paper reviews Bulgaria's
            national accounts data, and estimates the country's
            gross domestic product (GDP) in national currency for 1970
            and 1980 and the average growth rate of GDP for the period,
            1970-80. It also examines the role of the official exchange
            rate in the country and concludes that the official exchange
            rate vis-a-vis convertible currencies is not suitable to be
            used for converting the national currency GNP into US dollars.
