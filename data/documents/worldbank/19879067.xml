       as endorsed by the ESMAP governing body, the Consultative Group for the&#13;

        which ESMAP will continue supporting client countries to better address the&#13;
        energy security and poverty reduction nexus; and (ii) newly identified ESMAP&#13;
        initiatives that address thematic challenges and thereby strengthen ESMAP's&#13;
        comparative advantage as a global knowledge and technical assistance partnership.&#13;
&#13;
        Specifically, ESMAP's activities are developed around the following areas of focus:&#13;
&#13;

        develop strategies and investment programs and designing robust frameworks to&#13;
        track, monitor, and evaluate intervention costs and benefits of: i) measures to&#13;
        mitigate national energy systems vulnerabilities; ii) regional energy integration;&#13;
        and/or iii) low carbon growth.&#13;
&#13;

        SMEs both as providers and users of modem energy services to the poor in rural&#13;
        and urban communities; ii) enhance poverty reduction impacts of national/rural&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                ANNEX 3&#13;
&#13;
Governance Terms Applicable to the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program&#13;
                                   (ESMAP)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The following Governance Structure applies to ESMAP:&#13;
&#13;
1.     Consultative Group (CG)&#13;
&#13;
       ESMAP is governed and funded by a Consultative Group (CG) composed of&#13;
       representatives of Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland,&#13;
       the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the World Bank. The&#13;
       CG meets at least once a year and is chaired by a Vice President of the World Bank.&#13;
       This function is delegated to the Chair of the World Bank Energy and Mining&#13;
       Sector Board/Director of Energy, Transport and Water Department.&#13;
&#13;
2.     Technical Advisory Group (TAG)&#13;
&#13;
2.1.   A Technical Advisory Group (TAG) provides input to ESMAP's strategic agenda,&#13;
       and submits regular reports to the CG and to ESMAP Management.&#13;
&#13;
3.     The Energy and Mining Sector Board&#13;
&#13;
3.1.   The Energy and Mining Sector Board of the World Bank which includes the&#13;
       regional energy sector managers and ESMAP's manager ensure that ESMAP's&#13;
       strategy is consistent with the Bank's approach and priorities in the energy sector.&#13;
&#13;
3.2.   The ESMAP Manager, a senior official from the World Bank and a member of the&#13;
       Energy and Mining Sector Board, is responsible for administering the program,&#13;
       approving its activities, and overseeing their implementation.&#13;
&#13;
3.3.   The Manager is supported by a small staff responsible for donor relations, quality&#13;
       assurance, portfolio and financial management, and information dissemination. To&#13;
       conduct individual activities, ESMAP relies on a cadre of World Bank Group&#13;
       engineers, energy planners, economists and other development specialists, and on&#13;
       consultants.&#13;
