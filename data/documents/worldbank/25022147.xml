&amp;#12;&amp;#12;ACKNOWLEDGMENTS&#13;
&#13;
To better understand dynamics of agricultural risks and identify appropriate responses,&#13;
incorporate agricultural risk perspective into decision making, and build capacity of&#13;
local stakeholders in risk assessment and management, the Agricultural Risk Manage-&#13;
ment Team (ARMT) of the Agriculture and Environment Services Department of the&#13;
World Bank is conducting an agricultural sector risk assessment in Senegal. The cur-&#13;
rent report was developed by a team led by Stephen Dâ&#128;&#153;Alessandro and comprising&#13;
Amadou Abdoulaye Fall, George Grey, Kersten Hell, Traci Johnson, Simon Simpkin,&#13;
Kilara Suit, and Abdrahmane Wane.&#13;
&#13;
The team is especially grateful to Aifa Fatimata Ndoye Niane and Vikas Choudhary&#13;
of the World Bank for their support and inputs throughout the activityâ&#128;&#153;s planning,&#13;
fieldwork mission, and report preparation. The team would also like to extend its&#13;
appreciation to Maguette Diop Ndiaye of the Ministry of Economics and Finance, the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Equipment, other government representatives,&#13;
farmers, market traders, and all those who shared their perspective and insights, which&#13;
provided the basis for this study and its findings.&#13;
&#13;
This activity would not have been possible without the generous contributions from&#13;
USAID, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Netherlands and State&#13;
Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) of the Government of Switzerland.&#13;

Agricultural Sector Risk Assessment                                                       ix&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Senegalâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural economy today accounts for roughly one-sixth of national gross&#13;
domestic product (GDP), down from nearly one-quarter in the mid-1980s. Although&#13;
sector output has expanded by 70 percent over the past 30 years, population growth&#13;
has quadrupled. During this period, successive government policies have promoted&#13;
intensiï¬&#129;cation of crop and livestock production via supportive policies and public&#13;
investments.1 And yet, growth has been lackluster amid limited take-up of improved&#13;
seeds and fertilizer consumption that remains among the lowest in the region. A major&#13;
limiting factor has been widespread reluctance among the millions of smallholder&#13;
farmers in Senegal who dominate production to assume the risks associated with&#13;
increased productivity. With only limited capacity to manage these risks, highly vulner-&#13;
able farmers choose to limit their exposure by limiting their outlays. Moreover, unman-&#13;
aged risks have a profound impact on sector performance. A sound understanding of&#13;
the risks faced by farmers and other agricultural sector stakeholders enables develop-&#13;
ment of risk management systems that can at once support new productivity invest-&#13;
ments, strengthen resilience, reduce losses, and drive sector growth.&#13;
&#13;
This agricultural risk assessment study was undertaken to provide a review of produc-&#13;
tion, market, and enabling environment risks facing farmers and other stakeholders&#13;
across Senegalâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector. The report has been compiled with extensive anal-&#13;
ysis of crop and livestock production, price, and meteorological data records over the&#13;
period 1980â&#128;&#147;2012. It includes a review of key documentary evidence of yield and risk&#13;
events together with input from interviews held with farmers, traders, processors and&#13;
others in rural Senegal as well as with government and agricultural research staï¬&#128;&#13;
between March and May 2014. The results of the analysis are considered in the light&#13;
of the vulnerability of the diï¬&#128;erent stakeholders to the eï¬&#128;ects of ex post shock events&#13;
and the resulting ex ante impact upon investment. The most salient issues and results&#13;
of this analysis are outlined in the text of the report. A considerable volume of sup-&#13;
porting data is supplied in the appendixes, including (1) an analysis of cumulative&#13;
rainfall during 1980â&#128;&#147;2013; (2) an assessment of levels of vulnerability among key&#13;

 GOS expenditures on agriculture (as a percentage of total expenditure) have exceeded 12 percent on average during&#13;
the 10-year period 2000â&#128;&#147;10, well above the 10 percent commitment under NEPADâ&#128;&#153;s CAADP framework.&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER ONE&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Risks are a pervasive and permanent ï¬&#129;xture of the agricultural landscape. They are&#13;
also costly. Unchecked, they breed uncertainty and stiï¬&#130;e investments. For a given rate&#13;
of return, the higher the risk associated with an agricultural enterprise, the lower the&#13;
level of investment that it can attract. On the aggregate, this can have a debilitating&#13;
impact on sector growth. This is especially true when risk is ampliï¬&#129;ed by a limited&#13;
capacity to absorb shocks. When risks do manifest, they can cause substantial losses to&#13;
income and assetsâ&#128;&#148;especially among the most vulnerable communitiesâ&#128;&#148;placing&#13;
livelihoods, and in extreme cases, sector growth, in jeopardy. Failing to address&#13;
agricultural risk can severely hamper long-term economic growth and poverty&#13;
reduction eï¬&#128;orts.&#13;
&#13;
The performance of Senegalâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural performance exempliï¬&#129;es the impact of&#13;
unmanaged risk on productivity among vulnerable smallholder crop producers and&#13;
pastoralists. Despite the fact that well over half (57.1 percent in 2012) of the popula-&#13;
tion lives in rural areas and derives some portion of its livelihood from agriculture, the&#13;
sector itself contributes less than one-ï¬&#129;fth (16.7 percent in 2012) to GDP, according&#13;
to the World Bank. Despite several years of strong performance, sector growth has&#13;
averaged 2.3 percent since 1980, amid notable volatility in year-on-year performance&#13;
(ï¬&#129;gure 1.1).&#13;
&#13;
A succession of agricultural strategies designed to increase productivity has largely&#13;
failed to intensify production beyond a subsistence level, and much of the country,&#13;
although suitable for agriculture, remains underdeveloped. Keeping risks in check,&#13;
shielding the most vulnerable, and building resilience among all agricultural stake-&#13;
holders to better withstand and recover from inevitable shocks requires moving from&#13;
ad hoc interventions to proactive, systematic and sustained risk management.&#13;
&#13;
The government of Senegal has historically responded to drought and other shocks&#13;
with direct ï¬&#129;nancial support to farmers as well as general assistance to the rural popu-&#13;
lation. More recently, GOS put in place a series of emergency response and ï¬&#129;nancial&#13;
mechanisms to help aï¬&#128;ected communities better cope with shocks and enhance ï¬&#130;ows&#13;
of rural credit. These include the Fonds de Boniï¬&#129;cation, Fonds de Garantie, and the&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER TWO&#13;
AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS IN SENEGAL&#13;
To inform the analysis and discussion of agricultural risk in Senegal, this chapter&#13;
presents an overview of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector. The most pertinent sector&#13;
characteristics related to risk are given particular attention. The analysis primarily&#13;
covers the 33-year period from 1980 to 2012 to assess the frequency and severity of the&#13;
most important risks.&#13;
&#13;
AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN SENEGAL&#13;
Table 2.1 shows the key economic indicators for Senegal with notable import to agri-&#13;
culture. Of particular relevance is the fact that while approximately 57.1 percent2 of&#13;
the population lives in rural areas and is largely dependent upon agriculture, over the&#13;
ï¬&#129;ve years up to 2012, agriculture and associated activities generated only 16.7 per-&#13;
cent of national GDP, according to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s World Development Indicators.&#13;
Considering the current GDP of US$14.05 billion and a population of 13.73 mil-&#13;
lion, it is evident that there is considerable discrepancy in rural vs. urban incomes.&#13;
Whereas per capita GDP may be US$1,023, the average per capita value added for&#13;
the population dependent upon agriculture is US$300; the rest of the largely urban&#13;
population is 6.7 times higher (US$2,000). This is due largely to the relatively low&#13;
output of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural production systems, which generate less than&#13;
US$1.00 per capita per day. This suggests that the bulk of agricultural activity is of a&#13;
subsistence nature.&#13;
&#13;
In fact, the level of production is inadequate to meet national demand and Senegal&#13;
imports signiï¬&#129;cant volumes of food. Food imports in 2012 were worth US$1,546 mil-&#13;
lion, or 11 percent of GDP and up to 26 percent of total imports by value, according&#13;
to the World Bank. Senegalâ&#128;&#153;s exports are valued at slightly over 50 percent of total&#13;
imports and the current account is balanced largely through a combination of remit-&#13;
tances and development assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
 According to the World Bank, Senegal has one of the highest levels of urbanization in Africa, estimated at&#13;
42.9 percent in 2012 and growing at a rate of 3.6 percent per year.&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER THREE&#13;
AGRICULTURE SECTOR RISKS&#13;
The main sources of risk in Senegalâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural sector are reviewed in this chapter.&#13;
These include production risks, market risks, and a general set of risks associated with&#13;
the enabling environment for agriculture. The incidence and implications of multiple&#13;
or successive shocks are also considered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PRODUCTION RISKS&#13;
In terms of production, the most important factor contributing to agricultural risk is&#13;
weather. Other factors include crop pests and diseases (both before and after harvest),&#13;
windstorms, bush ï¬&#129;res, and livestock diseases having weak response mechanisms. Each&#13;
of these factors is considered in more detail below.&#13;
&#13;
WEATHER RISKS&#13;
Weather-related risks manifest mainly through extremes of temperature and precipita-&#13;
tion. In the former case, the actual impact of extreme temperatures upon crop yields&#13;
in Senegal is uncertain. Over the past 40 years, mean annual temperatures across&#13;
Senegal have increased rapidly (averaging 0.19Â°C per decade), but prior to that period,&#13;
mean annual temperatures had decreased substantially, so that current mean annual&#13;
temperatures have only recently regained the levels experienced at the beginning of&#13;
the last century (ï¬&#129;gure 3.1).&#13;
&#13;
Extreme Temperatures&#13;
Although it is evident that high temperatures that inhibit plant production (generally&#13;
in excess of 35Â°C) will occasionally occur during the growing season, their impact is&#13;
not easily determined, because it will often have been confounded by moisture stress.&#13;
Similarly, the impact of extreme cold is not easily measured because it occurs so rarely&#13;
in Senegal (although an important exception is the impact of cold rain upon weakened&#13;
livestock, as happened in 2002). Extreme temperatures may well constrain production,&#13;
but although changes in the frequency and impact of extreme temperature anomalies&#13;
can be modeled (see appendix A), they are not empirically evident. Temperature per&#13;
se is rarely considered by stakeholders as a contributory factor to crop production risk,&#13;
and does not feature as an observed cause of ex post impacts.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER FOUR&#13;
ADVERSE IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURAL&#13;
RISKS&#13;
The frequency, severity, and costs of adverse events are analyzed in this chapter as the&#13;
basis for prioritizing the various sources of risk. The conceptual and methodological&#13;
basis described below is then applied to production, market, and enabling environ-&#13;
ment risks. The various sources of risk are then reviewed to discern the most critical.&#13;
&#13;
CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL&#13;
BASIS FOR ANALYSIS&#13;
For the purposes of this study, risk is deï¬&#129;ned as an exposure to a signiï¬&#129;cant ï¬&#129;nancial&#13;
loss or other adverse outcome whose occurrence and severity is unpredictable. Risk&#13;
thus implies exposure to substantive losses, over and above the normal costs of doing&#13;
business. In agriculture, farmers incur moderate losses each year as the result of unex-&#13;
pected events such as suboptimal climatic conditions at diï¬&#128;erent times in the produc-&#13;
tion cycle and/or modest departures from expected output or input prices. Risk refers&#13;
to the more severe and unpredictable adverse events that occur beyond these smaller&#13;
events.&#13;
&#13;
This concept diï¬&#128;ers from the common perception of â&#128;&#156;riskâ&#128;&#157; by farmers and traders,&#13;
based on the year-to-year variability of production and prices. It should also be distin-&#13;
guished from constraints, which are predictable and constant limitations to productiv-&#13;
ity and growth and which contribute to ineï¬&#131;ciencies in production and marketing&#13;
systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LOSS THRESHOLDS&#13;
As agricultural production is inherently variable, the immediate step for analysis is to&#13;
deï¬&#129;ne loss thresholds, which distinguish adverse events from smaller, inter-annual varia-&#13;
tions in output. This is achieved by ï¬&#129;rst estimating a time trend of â&#128;&#156;expectedâ&#128;&#157; produc-&#13;
tion in any given year, based on actual production, and treating the downside diï¬&#128;erence&#13;
between actual and expected production as a measure of loss. A loss threshold of 0.33&#13;
standard deviation from trend is then set to distinguish between losses resulting from&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER FIVE&#13;
VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS&#13;
All stakeholders in agricultural value chains assume some level of risk. Vulnerability&#13;
presents when the potential impact of risk events is greater than a stakeholderâ&#128;&#153;s capac-&#13;
ity to absorb adverse impacts. This may be because knowledge of the frequencies or&#13;
impacts of risk events is inadequate (as a result, for example, of unforeseen changes in&#13;
climate) or because actions that might otherwise limit the level of risk assumed are&#13;
constrained by circumstances so that involuntary exposure to risk is increased. (This is&#13;
especially true where capacity for adaptation lags behind changing circumstances.)&#13;
A more comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to vulnerability is presented&#13;
in appendix C. Its key conclusions and relevance to diï¬&#128;erent types of stakeholders are&#13;
listed below.&#13;
&#13;
Table 5.1 provides a simple ranking of risks reported by smallholders (Wane and&#13;
Galandou 2012). The most oft-cited risk, reported by almost 50 percent of households,&#13;
highlights their perceived vulnerability to food price shocks. This is indicative of high&#13;
levels of market dependence because of insuï¬&#131;cient productive capacity together with&#13;
low levels of oï¬&#128;-farm income. It is perhaps notable that the most important vulnerabil-&#13;
ity is not to a risk inherent to agricultural production but to rural households as con-&#13;
sumers. Initiatives designed to increase the prices paid for staple crops may well expose&#13;
households to higher levels of vulnerability if not accompanied by other measures.&#13;
&#13;
The second most oft-cited risk also relates to cash dependence and the limited ï¬&#129;nan-&#13;
cial resources of producers that constrain their capacity to deal with increases in the&#13;
costs of inputs. It is again signiï¬&#129;cant that although this shock does aï¬&#128;ect agricultural&#13;
production, it is mediated through local input markets rather than through a physical&#13;
event such as drought or disease. The same is true for the fourth most important area&#13;
of vulnerability, that is, the loss of productive capacity through death, disease, or dis-&#13;
ability, which altogether aï¬&#128;ect almost 25 percent of households. These shocks may&#13;
aï¬&#128;ect agricultural production, but the eï¬&#128;ect is not upon the agricultural production&#13;
system itself.&#13;
&#13;
It is only the third most frequently cited risk event (poor rains), reported by nearly one-&#13;
quarter (23.8 percent) of households, that has a direct eï¬&#128;ect on agricultural production&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER SIX&#13;
RISK PRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
Previous sections have highlighted sources of risks that are pervasive across the Senega-&#13;
lese agriculture landscape. These risks are both numerous and complex. They manifest&#13;
with varying levels of frequency and severity, and can cause substantial losses to crops and&#13;
livestock, with profound short-term and long-term impacts on income and livelihoods.&#13;
Putting in place eï¬&#128;ective risk management measures can help mitigate adverse impacts&#13;
on agricultural supply chains and the livelihoods they support. However, it is virtually&#13;
impossible to address all risks at once. Thus, it is necessary to prioritize interventions&#13;
based on which risks occur most frequently and which cause the greatest ï¬&#129;nancial losses.&#13;
&#13;
RISK PRIORITIZATION&#13;
Using quantitative measures and anecdotal evidence collected directly from stakehold-&#13;
ers, this analysis has evaluated risks for the crop and livestock subsectors. Owing to the&#13;
lack of reliable data, some of the risks could not be quantiï¬&#129;ed. In such cases, the&#13;
assessment team relied more on qualitative measures. Based on the teamâ&#128;&#153;s combined&#13;
quantitative and qualitative assessment, table 6.1 prioritizes the most important risks.&#13;
This prioritization was presented during a roundtable at MEF in Dakar on March 21,&#13;
2014. It provides a basic ranking of agricultural risks on the basis of the probability of&#13;
the event occurring and the anticipated impacts in terms of ï¬&#129;nancial losses. The iden-&#13;
tiï¬&#129;ed risks located in the grayer areas represent the most signiï¬&#129;cant risks.&#13;
&#13;
Overall, this prioritization identiï¬&#129;ed (1) erratic rainfall, punctuated by drought; (2)&#13;
locusts; (3) price volatility; and (4) crop pest and diseases as the most important risks&#13;
facing Senegalâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural sector. Parasitic weeds such as Striga, aï¬&#130;atoxin contami-&#13;
nation (maize, groundnuts) and other postharvest threats, and livestock diseases were&#13;
also deemed important, but to a lesser extent.&#13;
&#13;
It is worth noting that incidences of drought have declined signiï¬&#129;cantly within the most&#13;
recent decade, but it remains unclear whether this change is temporary or rather the&#13;
result of a shift in long-term weather patterns. Although an observed wetting over&#13;
roughly the same period has led to recurrent ï¬&#130;ooding in many parts of the country,&#13;
aï¬&#128;ecting urban and coastal areas, impacts on crop and livestock production have been&#13;
limited at the aggregate level.&#13;

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ANALYSIS&#13;
&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Climate change is a long-term trend that will exacerbate natural resource constraints on&#13;
agricultural production in Senegal by making weather patterns more variable, and&#13;
increasing the frequency and intensity of severe weather events. As result, climate change&#13;
will directly aï¬&#128;ect the incidence of some agricultural risk events and indirectly aï¬&#128;ect the&#13;
incidence of others. Understanding how climate change trends aï¬&#128;ect farm productivity&#13;
is essential to formulating an agricultural risk management plan that maximizes the use&#13;
of scarce resources. Regardless of the future extent of global warming, identifying and&#13;
implementing risk management strategies that address agricultural risks, including those&#13;
exacerbated by climate change, can reduce volatility and improve sustainability in the&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE&#13;
In the Mapping the Impacts of Climate Change index under â&#128;&#156;Agricultural Productivity Loss,â&#128;&#157;&#13;
the Center for Global Development ranks Senegal sixth out of 233 countries globally for&#13;
â&#128;&#156;direct risksâ&#128;&#157; due to â&#128;&#156;physical climate impactsâ&#128;&#157; and 23rd out of 233 for â&#128;&#156;overall vulner-&#13;
abilityâ&#128;&#157; due to â&#128;&#156;physical impacts adjusted for coping abilityâ&#128;&#157; (Wheeler 2011).&#13;
&#13;
Like most of the countries in the Sahel region, Senegalâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural sector is highly&#13;
vulnerable to the eï¬&#128;ects of climate change. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s climate is already charac-&#13;
terized by high temperatures and low, highly variable annual precipitation, factors&#13;
that negatively aï¬&#128;ect the productivity of heat-sensitive crops. More than 95 percent&#13;
of the total cropped area depends on rain-fed systems, and most farmers and herd-&#13;
ers practice traditional forms of agriculture (Khouma et al. 2013, 319). Because of&#13;
these factors and the importance of the sector in Senegalâ&#128;&#153;s national economy, cli-&#13;
mate change impacts on crop yields and land suitability will have far-reaching&#13;
eï¬&#128;ects.&#13;
&#13;
The agricultural sector accounts for approximately 15 percent of GDP and is an&#13;
important source of foreign exchange earnings. Agriculture also plays a key role in&#13;

SENEGAL VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS&#13;
&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Agricultural shocks are one important factor driving chronic poverty and food insecu-&#13;
rity in Senegal. Shocks aï¬&#128;ect household well-being in a variety of ways, by limiting&#13;
food availability, weakening food access, and negatively aï¬&#128;ecting monetary well-being&#13;
through the depletion of productive assets. Chronically vulnerable groups with high&#13;
exposure to hazards experience a disproportionate impact from adverse events and&#13;
lack coping mechanisms available to other groups. In this context, vulnerability is a&#13;
useful lens through which to examine agricultural shocks because it allows policy mak-&#13;
ers to determine which groups are most aï¬&#128;ected and to target risk management solu-&#13;
tions accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
GENERAL TRENDS&#13;
Rural households are more likely to be poor and food insecure than are urban house-&#13;
holds in Senegal. In rural districts, 15.1 percent of households are severely or moder-&#13;
ately food insecure, compared with 8.6 percent in urban districts. Malnutrition, a&#13;
direct cause of food insecurity, is signiï¬&#129;cantly higher in rural areas: almost 20 percent&#13;
of rural children under age ï¬&#129;ve are stunted, compared with 9 percent of children in&#13;
urban zones. Important sources of vulnerability in the rural environment include (1)&#13;
poor access to markets, (2) low levels of educational attainment and poor quality edu-&#13;
cation, and (3) lack of diversity in income opportunities. All three factors increase the&#13;
vulnerability of households to food insecurity and aï¬&#128;ect rural communities more&#13;
acutely than urban ones.&#13;

&amp;#12;APPENDIX C&#13;
AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE IN SENEGAL&#13;
Agriculture is important for Senegal. It contributes 20 percent to GDP and provides&#13;
employment to 60 percent of its workforce. It is key to food security and to protect the&#13;
country against the increasing ï¬&#130;uctuations of international food prices, which saw rice&#13;
prices triple in 2007â&#128;&#147;08.&#13;
&#13;
The increase of agriculture productivity is a paramount objective of the government&#13;
of Senegal. The Programme de Relance et dâ&#128;&#153;AccÃ©lÃ©ration de la Cadence de&#13;
lâ&#128;&#153;Agriculture au SÃ©nÃ©gal aims at implementing the objectives of the Plan Senegal&#13;
Emergent in the agriculture sector and focuses on four strategic crops: rice, onions,&#13;
groundnuts, and oï¬&#128;-season fruits and vegetables. The underlying goals that explain the&#13;
selection of these crops are: (1) coverage of the whole of Senegal with these products;&#13;
(2) gradual suppression of food dependence (rice and onions); (3) development of&#13;
exports (oï¬&#128;-season fruits and vegetables); and (4) jobs creation and additional income&#13;
generation.&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture is risky in Senegal. Ninety-eight percent of cultivated land is rain fed, and&#13;
as Senegal belongs to the Sahel, rain is scarce in parts of the country and unreliable&#13;
across the country, causing damage by excess as well as scarcity. The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Agriculture Risk Management Team estimates that during 1980â&#128;&#147;2012, total losses&#13;
from production risks aï¬&#128;ecting maize, rice, millet, sorghum, peanuts, and cowpeas&#13;
alone totaled US$1.38 billion, that is, US$41.7 million per year. A detailed report was&#13;
shared with the government of Senegal in the second half of 2014; its ï¬&#129;ndings have&#13;
informed the work of the AIDP and this report.&#13;
&#13;
World Bank analysis using the ModÃ¨le dâ&#128;&#153;Analyse des Risques de Cultures du SÃ©nÃ©gal&#13;
modeled an average annual crop loss cost of 10 percent of national crop value and&#13;
indicates a 1 in 100 year loss of 44 percent of the national average crop value. The&#13;
2002â&#128;&#147;03 drought cost an estimated 35 percent of national crop production, almost&#13;
US$50 million. Annual groundnut production decreased by 70 percent, likewise the&#13;
average cash ï¬&#130;ow to groundnut farmers. The 2004â&#128;&#147;05 locust infestation reduced mil-&#13;
let yields by 23 percent and sorghum yields by 14 percent. The livestock sector is also&#13;

&amp;#12;APPENDIX F&#13;
RATIONALE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT&#13;
METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
The rationale behind the risk prioritization exercise is based upon the nature of risk in&#13;
agriculture, and it is necessary to deï¬&#129;ne risk to understand its nature. First it is key to&#13;
recognize that risk is an abstract concept associated with an activity, and cannot exist&#13;
of itself. Only if an activity is undertaken does the possibility of its outcomes being&#13;
diï¬&#128;erent to those hoped. Secondly, risk involves a detrimental outcome normally but&#13;
not always associated with reduced returns on investment. Farmers the world over are&#13;
aware that there is â&#128;&#156;a riskâ&#128;&#157; inherent in crop production and that in doing so they â&#128;&#156;riskâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
the assets that they invest in the process. Thirdly, the risk inherent in an activity is mag-&#13;
niï¬&#129;ed as the ratio between the potential for downside loss and the capacity to absorb&#13;
that loss (Weeks 1970) Commercial farmers who risk $1,000 per ha but have the assets&#13;
to sustain a loss of that size take on less risk than a smallholder for whom the loss of&#13;
$1,000 might result in complete bankruptcy and loss of livelihood.&#13;
&#13;
Since the word risk is widely used colloquially, It is also important to deï¬&#129;ne what, for&#13;
the purposes of this prioritization exercise at least, risk is not. It is not a speciï¬&#129;c type of&#13;
eventâ&#128;&#148;such as drought. Although we talk of such events as â&#128;&#156;risks,â&#128;&#157; they are not risks&#13;
of themselves. Although the potential for a drought to occur might contribute to the&#13;
risk inherent in crop production, the fact that a drought might contribute much more&#13;
to rain-fed crop production that it would to irrigated vegetable production highlights&#13;
the fact that risk is more a property of an activity than of the event itself. Neither is risk&#13;
the probability that an event might occur. Although the work risk is often colloquially&#13;
used in place of chance or probability, the words are not interchangeable. A greater prob-&#13;
ability that a detrimental event might occur can increase the risk inherent in an activity&#13;
that is aï¬&#128;ected by that event, but does not itself constitute that risk.&#13;
&#13;
Risk as described above is an abstract and subjective concept, but it is a critical aspect&#13;
of the stochastic processes that typify agricultural production systems. Although deter-&#13;
ministic value chain analyses can help to determine the optimal path for rural develop-&#13;
ment, the reality is often at odds with deterministic optima, frequently as a result of the&#13;
impacts of risk upon rural investment decisions. Unless the perceived risks faced by&#13;

This is even more the case in the livestock sector. The          the household, and especially its food security. It is the fear&#13;
majority of ruminants in Africa are kept under extensive         of food insecurity that drives the majority of investment&#13;
management in ancient systems that were not set up to            decisions faced by smallholders so that, when faced with&#13;

means of making a living or earning an income. These             important therefore to qualify the priorities developed&#13;
extensive livestock production systems are strongly driven       from national data and to note and explain the diï¬&#128;erences&#13;

            Senegal - Agricultural sector risk assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The performance of Senegal’s
            agricultural performance exemplifies the impact of unmanaged
            risk on productivity among vulnerable smallholder crop
            producers and pastoralists. The government of Senegal has
            historically responded to drought and other shocks with
            direct financial support to farmers as well as general
            assistance to the rural population. The World Bank, with
            support from the group of eight (G-8) and the United States
            Agency for International Development (USAID) and in
            collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
            Equipment (MARE), commissioned the present study. The
            objective of this assessment was to assist the government of
            Senegal to: (1) identify, analyze, quantify, and prioritize
            principal risks facing the agricultural sector; (2) analyze
            the impact of these risks; and (3) identify and prioritize
            appropriate risk management interventions that may
            contribute to improved stability, reduced vulnerability, and
            increased resilience of agricultural supply chains in
            Senegal. This report presents a summary of the assessment’s
            key findings. Chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two
            provides an overview of the agricultural sector in Senegal
            and a discussion of key growth constraints. An assessment of
            the main agricultural risks is presented in chapter three.
            Chapter four analyzes the frequency and severity of
            highlighted risks and assesses their impact. Chapter five
            presents some stakeholder perceptions of risks and evaluates
            levels of vulnerability among various livelihood groups. The
            study concludes in chapter six with an assessment of
            priorities for risk management and a broad discussion of
            possible risk management measures that can help to
            strengthen the resiliency of agricultural supply chains and
            the livelihoods they support.
