            An update of the World Bank Group's
            Privatization Database shows that privatization in
            developing countries continued to pick up in 2004 and 2005,
            with 400 transactions worth US$90 billion. Apart from 1997,
            the 2005 result in nominal terms is the highest since 1990
            (when the data start). Transaction values remained
            concentrated in 10 countries, with 4 new entrants joining
            the group. The top 10 deals, largely in banking and
            telecommunications, again accounted for 40 percent of the total.
