ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper presents sources and uses of funds accounts integrated&#13;
in a macroeconomic framework for analysing financing patterns and economic&#13;
interdependence among sectors in India, contrasting the period 1975-80&#13;
with the Sixth Plan period 1980-85. To achieve compatibility and&#13;
consistency of data, national accounts, monetary accounts, Central and&#13;
State Government budgets and the balance of payments are integrated into&#13;
this setting. This framework is also used as a programming tool linking&#13;
the financiAl and real flows of the economy to derive consistent&#13;
projections for the Sixth Plan, not only in terms of aggregate output,&#13;
savings and investment assumptions, but also regarding inflation, the rate&#13;
of monetary expansion and intersectoral financing patterns, which have&#13;
highlighted some economic policy issues and options.&#13;

FOREWORD&#13;
This working paper by A. Pinell-Siles and V.J. Ravishankar is an&#13;
application of the sources and uses of funds approach to the analysis of&#13;
country economic problems and prospects. It is one of a number of efforts&#13;
by Bank staff to apply this general analytical approach. We believe it&#13;
offers promise for a better understanding of the recent past and for&#13;
improvements in medium-term economic and financial programming for the&#13;
future. It is, however, still very much an experimental approach which&#13;
must be adapted to the concerns and data in each particular case. Our&#13;
initial work in this area grew out of the Bank's long standing interest in&#13;
the analysis of public sector investment programs and their financing.&#13;
The sources and uses of funds approach provides a useful macro-economic&#13;
framework for such investment program analyses because it covers both how&#13;
savings are generated in the main sectors of the economy (the current&#13;
account matrix) and how they are transferred from the sectors that are net&#13;
savers to those that are net investors (the capital account matrix).&#13;
The sources and uses of funds approach attempts to make more effective&#13;
use of existing data by integrating them into a consistent framework&#13;
covering the main sectors of an economy. It thus is a rearrangement and&#13;
reconciliation of the data normally found in government budgets, balance&#13;
of payments statements, monetary accounts and national income accounts.&#13;
By looking at the intersectoral flows one identifies and hopefully&#13;
reconciles inconsistencies, leading to a better understanding of these&#13;
basic economic data, and also generates a residual account for the private&#13;
sector. Particularly when used as a macro framework for public sector&#13;
economic and financial programming, it is important to have such a private&#13;
sector account which can show the implications for the private sector of&#13;
the totality of projected public sector transactions.&#13;
The definition of a sector is sometimes more a question of what is&#13;
desirable and feasible in the particular case than what might be "correct"&#13;
in terms of a more abstract standard. For example, the present study&#13;
treats the central government, the state governments and the public&#13;
enterprises as separate sectors when the available data made this&#13;
possible. The account for the private sector tends to be a residual&#13;
which, in effect, includes errors and omissions. In contrast to the flows&#13;
of funds studies which focus on financial intermediation in the economy&#13;
(and particularly within the private sector), the sources and uses of&#13;
funds approach used in this study looks at the current as well as the&#13;
capital account and looks especially at flows to and from the public&#13;
sector (and within the public sector insofar as it can be disaggregated).&#13;
This paper reports on work in progress with respect to both the&#13;
methodology of sources and uses of funds analysis and the substantive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
results from applying this approach in India0 On methodology there are,&#13;
in particular, unresolved questions about the deflators that should be&#13;
used in moving between matrices in current and constant prices and on the&#13;
interpretation of capital account matrices in constant prices. This study&#13;
is being made available to a wider audience as a Staff lWorking Paper&#13;
because of the interesting substantive analysis of the past and future&#13;
financing of investment in India, the data set that is made available in&#13;
the annex tables (particularly for 1975/76 through 1980/81) and the&#13;
discussion of the methodological issues involved.&#13;

FINANCING OF INVESTMENT IN INDIA: 1975-1985&#13;
A SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS APPROACH&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF MAIN RESULTS&#13;
1.      This paper presents sources and uses of funds accounts integrated&#13;
in a macroeconomic framework for analysing financing patterns and economic&#13;
interdependence among sectors in India, contrasting the period 1975-80&#13;
with the Sixth Plan period 1980-85. 1/ This analysis makes extensive use&#13;
of the double-entry accounting principle in which payments (uses of funds)&#13;
by one sector are at the same time the receipts (sources of funds) of&#13;
another sector. To achieve compatibility and consistency of data,&#13;
national accounts, monetary accounts, Central and State Governments&#13;
budgets and the balance of payments are integrated into this setting,&#13;
which is also used as a programming tool linking the financial and real&#13;
flows of the economy to derive consistent projections for the Sixth&#13;
Plan. 2/ This framework can also be used to trace the implications of a&#13;
change in a given flow on the rest of the system; e.g. the adjustments&#13;
required in other sectors in response to an increase in public investment&#13;
financed by borrowing from the banking system. The domestic economy has&#13;
been disaggregated into the following sectors: private sector, Central&#13;
Government, State Governments and non-departmental enterprises; 3/ the&#13;
1/ The period 1975-80 refers to the five fiscal years 1975-76 to 1979/80.&#13;
Similarly, 1980-85 refers to the period 1980/81 to 1984/85. The&#13;
Indian fiscal year runs from April 1 through March 31.&#13;
2/ The major official sources of these data are: 1) Central&#13;
Statistical Organization (CSO), National Account Statistics&#13;
(annual issues) and "Quick Estimates" published every year in&#13;
January/February; 2) Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Monthly&#13;
and Weekly Bulletin on Monetary Accounts, and detailed flow-of-funds&#13;
tables for the period 1970/71-1976/77 (RBI Bulletin, March 1980);&#13;
3) Central Government, Economic and Functional Classification of&#13;
the Central Government Budget, published annually by the Ministry&#13;
of Finance; 4) Consolidated Accounts of State Government Budgets,&#13;
published by RBI and by the Ministry of Finance. Independent&#13;
estimates of the balance of payments were derived on the basis of&#13;
these and other official sources.&#13;
3/ Refers to autonomous public sector units whose accounts are excluded&#13;
from Central or State Governments budgets, although they may receive&#13;
some financing from Government budgets. In contrast, departmental&#13;
enterprises belonging to Central or State Governments are those whose&#13;
accounts are integrated in the corresponding budgets of Central or&#13;
State Governments.&#13;

analysis focuses on current and capital transactions0 The current account&#13;
of the sources and uses of funds accounts analyses the transformation of&#13;
GDP into disposable income by sector and its breakdown between consumption&#13;
and savings  ensuring consistency of aggregate savings and investment via&#13;
the current account deficit of the balance of payments0 The capital&#13;
account studies investment financing patterns and includes monetary&#13;
accounts and the balance of payments to reflect, respectively the finan-&#13;
cial intermediation of the banking system and capital transactions with&#13;
the rest of the world. 1/&#13;
20      Although the paper focuses on financial aspects to a large extent&#13;
it is primarily a device for analysing broad economic changes over timeo&#13;
In effect, national accounts are fully integrated into this approach and&#13;
an effort is made to estimate the extent of the deterioration in India's&#13;
terms of trade in the 1970s and its implications on disposable income and&#13;
savings0 Attention is also focused on real lntersectoral financing pat-&#13;
terns, where there are complex methodological issues regarding deflation&#13;
in the context of capital gains and losses0 The paper analyses the nature&#13;
of the financing of public sector0s investment savings gap, and derives a&#13;
consistent set of estimates, including not only direct borrowing but also&#13;
what has been defined here as "segnorage", which reflects the erosion of&#13;
private sector's net monetary assets on account of inflation0 The struc-&#13;
ture of this paper is as follows0 The remainder of this section presents&#13;
a summary of the main results of the paper0 Income, savings and invest-&#13;
ment patterns are reviewed in Section II while Section III concentrates on&#13;
intersectoral financing patterns since 1975/76. Appendix A presents data&#13;
sources, assumptions and methodology used in the derivation of the sources&#13;
and uses of funds accounts and in the projections up to 1984/85o Tables&#13;
are included in the Annex.&#13;
3.      Summary of Main Results0   This paper attempts a systematic&#13;
integration of macroeconomic accounts in a sources and uses of funds&#13;
framework to derive consistent estimates and projections0 Although the&#13;
broad contours of the Indian economy are generally known, a systematic&#13;
integration and analysis of the financial interrelationships among dif-&#13;
ferent sectors of the economy are not available, partly because of data&#13;
limitations but also due to the inherent difficulties in quantifying some&#13;

Governments were consolidated and referred to as "General Government",&#13;
whereas in the capital account they are fully separated0 In the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

of these aspects. 1/ The main results of this paper can be summarized as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a) The deterioration in the terms of trade since the mid-1970s&#13;
accounted for about 1.5% of Gross Domestic Income (GDY) in 1975-80 (at&#13;
constant 1970/71 prices). Had it not been for the large inflow of net&#13;
current transfers and factor payments from abroad, the terms of trade&#13;
deterioration would have emerged clearly on the current account (para. 4).&#13;
(b)  During the period 1975-80 aggregate investment was financed&#13;
primarily from internal sources.   Aggregate- nfVtment and national --&#13;
savings averaged about 22.1% of GDP in 1975-80, compared to an investment&#13;
rate of only 18.3% of GDP and foreign savings of 0.7% of GDP in 1970-75.&#13;
Net capital inflow averaging about 1.2% of GDP in 1975-80 enabled the&#13;
accumulation of net foreign exchange assets, which increased from&#13;
Rs 5.97 billion as of March 31, 1975 to Rs 60.16 billion as of March 31,&#13;
1980 (para. 7).&#13;
(c) Against this background the 1980s have begun on a strikingly&#13;
different note. The current account deficit as percentage of GDP at&#13;
market prices increased sharply to 2.0% in 1980/81 and 2.7% in 1981/82.&#13;
Although it is projected to decline in the remainder of the Sixth Plan,&#13;
the overall average is expected to be around 2.3% of GDP in 1980-85&#13;
(para. 8).&#13;
(d) The anticipated level of real expenditure in the next few&#13;
years will make possible the fulfillment of the Plan investment targets&#13;
and allow per capita consumption to increase at about 1% per annum in real&#13;
terms between 1981/82 and 1984/85. To achieve this level of expenditure&#13;
expansion within the anticipated level of foreign savings, it will be&#13;
necessary to increase gross national savings in both the public and&#13;
private sectors (para. 9).&#13;
(e) The adjustment process envisaged over the next few years will&#13;
have two aspects. First, the gross national savings rate will have to&#13;
rise from 22.2% in 1980/81 to 25.3% in 1984/85, not only in order to&#13;
finance a rising rate of investment, but also to substitute gradually for&#13;
foreign savings, which will, after peaking at 2.7% of GDP in 1981/82, go&#13;
down to 2.0% by 1984/85. Second, the high level of investment and the&#13;
consequently higher flows of income and expenditure will have to be&#13;
managed in such a manner as to substitute domestic production for imports&#13;
where such substitution is economic, and to increase exports in order to&#13;
1/   For instance, the conversion of current price series to constant&#13;
prices to assess real changes over time in the context of capital&#13;
gains and losses.&#13;

reduce the current account deficit without a need to cut back on the&#13;
economy's rate of growth. The reduction in the balance of payments&#13;
deficit will require a higher expansion of production and gross national&#13;
disposable income than of aggregate expenditure. In turn, to facilitate&#13;
the adjustment over time, the expansion of expenditure is expected to&#13;
concentrate primarily on investment, which is expected to increase sub-&#13;
stantially during the Sixth Plan (para. 10)o&#13;
(f) In spite of a sizeable increase in public savings, public&#13;
investment is anticipated to increase faster in the course of the Sixth&#13;
Plan, thereby increasing the savings-invpstment gap of the public sector&#13;
from 5.3% of GDP in 1975-80 to about 7.3% of GDP in 1980-85. In 1975-80&#13;
the savings-investment gap of the public sector was financed by the exter-&#13;
nal sector (1.2% of GDP), household savings (net lending, Li%) and the&#13;
banking system (3.0%). The larger savings-investment gap in the public&#13;
sector in 1980-85 confronts a less favorable external environment for&#13;
concessional finance than in the past, and definite limits on the extent&#13;
to which the banking system can accommodate higher public sector borrowing&#13;
without either displacing credit to the private sector or bringing about&#13;
excess liquidity, There is some scope for higher net borrowing directly&#13;
from the household sector, as Government has shown in the last two years,&#13;
but it is contingent upon the public sector being able to go beyond cap-&#13;
tive sources of borrowing (small savings and provident funds), by offering&#13;
more attractive terms than in the past in ways which can stimulate&#13;
household savings. There is greater scope however for closing the&#13;
savings-investment gap in the public sector through additional resource&#13;
mobilization measures to be taken within the public sector itself (paras.&#13;
14 and 15).&#13;
(g) It is not possible to separate fully the financial perfor-&#13;
mance of the Central Government or State Governments from that of&#13;
non-departmental enterprises, since they are closely inter-linked and have&#13;
large financial transfers. In 1975-80 the savings investment gap of&#13;
non-departmental enterprises was 3.7% of GDP and was financed by State&#13;
Government (1.4% of GDP), Central Government (1o2% of GDP), credits from&#13;
the banking system (0.8% of GDP) and only marginally by private savings&#13;
(0.3% of GDP; para. 16)o&#13;
(h) The effect of inflation in transferring resources from the&#13;
private sector to the public sector through the depletion in the value of&#13;
outstanding net monetary assets of the private sector ("seignorage2") is&#13;
quantitatively at least as important as direct lending from the private&#13;
sector to the public sector0 It financed about 16% of real public invest-&#13;
ment in 1975-80 and is projected to account for about 20% ir. 1980-85&#13;
(para. 17)o&#13;
(i) In conclusion, this paper has illustrated the application of&#13;
the sources and uses of funds analysis to the Indian economy, portraying&#13;

the financial inter-dependence between the private and public sectors and&#13;
the way their respective income, savings and investment patterns, in&#13;
conjunction with inter-sectoral financing through the banking system and&#13;
balance of payments, bring about alternative configurations of the&#13;
economy. It has also derived a consistent set of projections, not only in&#13;
terms of aggregate output, savings and investment assumptions, but also&#13;
regarding inflation, the rate of monetary expansion and inter-sectoral&#13;
financing patterns, which have highlighted some economic policy issues and&#13;
options.&#13;

II. INCOME, SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PATTERNS&#13;
4.      Income Patterns. The deterioration in India's terms of trade&#13;
since the mid-1970s has had a negative impact on income: whereas for the&#13;
period 1970-75 the cumulative terms of trade effect (TTE) at 1970/71&#13;
prices was almost negligible (only Rs 101 billion or 001% of GDY), 1/ it&#13;
reached Rs 37.1 billion in 1975-80 or 1.5% of GDY in this period. Had it&#13;
not been for the significant inflow of net current transfers from abroad&#13;
(mostly workers' remittances from the Middle East) and net factor payments&#13;
from abroad, national disposable income and the current account deficit in&#13;
1975-80 would have been very different from their actual values. 2/&#13;
(Table 1 and Graph 1)o Despite the worsening terms of trade in the second&#13;
half of the 1970s--which led to a higher trade deficit adjusted for TITE&#13;
despite substantial growth in exports--the significant inflow of current&#13;
transfers and net factor payments from abroad generated a current account&#13;
surplus (at 1970/71 prices) of Rs 1.6 billion in 1975-80, compared to a&#13;
deficit of Rs 13.9 billion in 1970-75. Since 1979/80, however, the&#13;
balance of payments has turned into deficit, partly as a result of an&#13;
additional deterioration of the terms of trade prompted by petroleum price&#13;
increases.&#13;

5.      External factors have had an important influence on income pat-&#13;
terns, but a much more crucial determinant has been domestic production&#13;
itself. In turn, variations in domestic production often had repercus-&#13;
sions on the balance of payments as shortfalls of important commodities&#13;
were relieved through imports. Compared to an average real growth rate of&#13;
about 3.6% per annum since Independence, actual growth rates i-a the most&#13;
recent three-year period have shown large variability. Real CDP at factor&#13;
cost declined by about 5.0% in 1979/80, and increased subseque.atly by 7.5%&#13;
in 1980/81 and by about 5.5% in 1981/820 GDP at constant marktet prices&#13;
overstates actual income since it ignores the terms of trade effect, which&#13;
for instance brought about a sharper decline in GDY than of GDP in 1979/80&#13;
(Table 2)o To some extent this was alleviated by the inflow cf net cur-&#13;
rent transfers and factor payments from abroad, as reflected in gross&#13;
national disposable income. Notwithstanding these income patterns, real&#13;
expenditure declined to a smaller extent than gross national disposable&#13;
income in 1979/80 and increased faster in 1980/810 In effect the widening&#13;
balance of payments deficit since 1979/80 reflects a growing disparity&#13;
between expenditure and gross national disposable income, partly as a&#13;
result of the deterioration in India's terms of trade which implied an&#13;
income loss and would have required an equivalent contraction in domestic&#13;
expenditure to prevent the deficit0 However, the decline in expenditure&#13;
required to eliminate the current deficit would have seriously affected&#13;
consumption, investment and growth prospects0 Under these circumstances,&#13;
India opted for sustaining the level of real expenditures and increasing&#13;
foreign savings to finance those expenditures, while applying these&#13;
resources progressively to adiust production and expenditure patterns to&#13;
encourage exports and import bubstitution.&#13;

6.      In the light of achievement in the first two years of the Plan&#13;
period, and assuming average weather conditions for the remaining three&#13;
years, the Sixth Plan's aggregate growth target should be achieved. The&#13;
achievement of the target would require GDP to grow at about 4.5% per&#13;
annum in the last three years which should be within reach given the&#13;
investment in new capacity in recent years, and the scope for improving&#13;
capacity utilization. This rate is higher than the long-term growth rate&#13;
of the Indian economy of about 3.6% per annum. Gross Domestic Income&#13;
(GDY) is projected to increase at a slightly lower rate due to terms of&#13;
trade losses which, relative to 1980/81 prices, will be about 0.4% of GDY&#13;
for the period 1980-85.&#13;
7.      Savings and Investment Patterns.   Aggregate investment, national&#13;
savings and foreign savings rates (expressed as percentage of GDP at&#13;
current market prices) are presented in Table 3, which shows five-year&#13;
averages for the period 1970-85 separately for the public and private&#13;
sectors. 1/ There has been a considerable increase in investment and&#13;
national savings rates in 1975-80 compared to 1970-75. During the period&#13;
1975-80 aggregate investment was financed primarily from internal sources.&#13;
Aggregate investment and savings averaged about 22.1% of GDP in 1975-80,&#13;
compared to an investment rate of only 18.3% of GDP and foreign saving of&#13;
0.74% of GDP in 1970-75. 2/ Net capital inflow averaging about 1.2% of GDP&#13;
in 1975-80 enabled the accumulation of net foreign exchange assets, which&#13;
1/ For simplicity the entire private sector has been aggregated into one&#13;
category. In para 10 below it will be shown that only the household&#13;
sector generates positive financial savings. The private corporate&#13;
sector tends to invest more than their own savings and is thus a net&#13;
recipient of financial resources from the household sector.&#13;
2/ The current account deficit of the balance of payments (foreign&#13;
savings) reflects an excess of aggregate investment over aggregate&#13;
national savings, or equivalently an excess of aggregate domestic&#13;
expenditure (on consumption and investment) over gross national dis-&#13;
posable income. See the note in Table A.l. It can also' be seen as&#13;
resulting from combining the investment savings gap in the private&#13;
sector (i.e. the financial savings of the private sector) with the&#13;
savings investment gap of the public sector.&#13;

80      Against this background, the 1980s have begun on a strikingly&#13;
different note. In the first tuo fiscal years the current account deficit&#13;
averaged 2.3% of GDP at market prices, after increasing from 2o0% in&#13;
1980/81 to 2.7% in 1981/82. Although it is projected to decline in the&#13;
remainder of the Sixth Plan period 1980-85, the overall average is&#13;
expected to be around 2.3% of GDP, uhich wi'll entail additional losses in&#13;
1/ Net foreign assets are defined inclusive of SDR holdings and reserve&#13;
position at the Fund. The value of net foreign assets in terms of&#13;
imports (at 1980/81 prices) increased from Rs 10046 billion in&#13;
March 1975 to Rs 93.27 billion in March 1979, but registered sharp&#13;
falls in 1980 and 1981 as a result o£ large import price increases,&#13;
reaching only Rs 55o08 billion as of March 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

net foreign exchange assets and require additional financing. Total&#13;
investment is projected to increase to 25.7% of GDPmp, to be financed by a&#13;
slightly higher level of national savings (23.4%) and significantly higher&#13;
level of foreign savings (2.3%).   In real terms (constant 1980/81 prices),&#13;
gross investment is projected to increase from Rs 1,289.27 billion in&#13;
1975-80 to Rs 1,739.50 billion in 1980-85 (34.9% increase), while gross&#13;
national savings is projected to increase from Rs 1,295.84 billion in&#13;
1975-80 to Rs 1,585.81 billion in 1980-85 (22.4% increase).&#13;
9.      The anticipated level of real expenditure in the next few years&#13;
will make possible the fulfillment of the Plan investment targets and&#13;
allow per capita consumption to increase at about 1% per annum in real&#13;
terms between 1981/82 and 1984/85. The Sixth Plan investment program&#13;
continues and intensifies the investment prioriti.es which succeeded in&#13;
accelerating India's economic growth in the second half of the 1970s and&#13;
which remain relevant to its current needs. The Plan is designed to&#13;
alleviate some of the major infrastructural bottlenecks that inhibited&#13;
output growth in the past. Expansion in infrastructural capacity typi-&#13;
cally requires large capital investment per unit of output. This explains&#13;
to a large extent the increase in investment rate and the increase in the&#13;
relative share of the public sector investment. Although the Government&#13;
encourages private investment in infrastructure, because of the size and&#13;
nature of the investment required, an increase in infrastructure invest-&#13;
ment in India virtually means an increase in public sector investment.&#13;
The sizeable increase in the share of private investment in 1980/81,&#13;
although to some extent due to the replenishment of private foodgrains&#13;
stocks, is also indicative of the fact that private investment responds,&#13;
among other factors, to an increase in the availability of infrastructural&#13;
services.&#13;
10.    'Savings.  Relative to its low per capita income India has attained&#13;
very high savings rates, which increased particul-arly rapidly in the 1970s&#13;
reaching an average of 22.1% of GDP in the second half of the decade&#13;
compared to 17.6% in the first half (Table 3). The most dramatic increase&#13;
took place in private savings, which accounted for about 79% of all&#13;
savings in the period 1975-80. There are three main 'forces behind the&#13;
increase in the private savings rate:    (  the increase in curren t- trans-&#13;
fers from_abroad (consisting mostly of remit`tance~s from `Ind_ia_n-wo'rkers in&#13;
th'Wlii'ddle East) and the high savings component associated with those&#13;
flows ; (F) the-st-rong-~growth in production in the period 1975-79 which&#13;
boosted- ",-rea-1_ disposable- icome-an-ttihe ~average propensity to save, and&#13;
(Co' flze price stability that characterized the period 1975-79, which&#13;
enhanced real returns to savings. Most of the increase in private savings&#13;
took place in the household sector (which also includes unincorporated&#13;
enterprises); private corporate savings as percentage of GDP remained low&#13;
(generally less than 2%) and did not have a clear trend in the 1970s.&#13;
Household savings as percentage of GDP increased from about 12.7% in&#13;
1970-75 to about 15.9% in 1975-80. Household financial savings (i.e.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18&#13;
excluding gross capital formation by the household sector) registered a&#13;
very rapid growth--increasing from 4.2% of GDP in 1970=75 to 6.2% in&#13;
1975-80. The household sector has thus become an important net supplier&#13;
of resources to the private corporate sector and to the public sector,&#13;
sectors which normally invest more than their own savings.&#13;

Note: The breakdown of public sector savings differs from CSO data due to the&#13;
adoption of Central Government savings from budget data9 as explained&#13;
in Appendix A, para A020&#13;
Source:  CSO, National Accounts Statistics9 1981, and Quick Estimates dated&#13;
February 89 19820&#13;
11 o    Savings rates in the private sector are projected to increase from&#13;
about 17.5% of GDP in 1975-80 to about 18.6% in 1980-85o This savings&#13;
rate is derived on the basis of overall investment and current account&#13;
deficit projections after discounting public sector's savings (see&#13;
para A0 14)0  An alternative would have been to project private savings on&#13;
the basis of the experience in the 1970s, which reflected a margInal&#13;
savings rate out of real private disposable income of about 33% (see&#13;
para Ao14)o  However9 there is the presumption that the savings experience&#13;
in the 1970s was somewhat exceptional, especially in view of the three&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
developments listed above and the fall in savings rates in 1979/80 and&#13;
1980/81.&#13;
12.     Although there has been an increase in public saving rates in the&#13;
1970s their level remains low and somewhat vulnerable to inflationary&#13;
conditions. The public sector increased its savings rate from 3.2% in&#13;
1970-75 to about 4.6% in 1975-80. This was achieved by a rapid expansion&#13;
of public disposable income from 12.6% of GDP in 1970-75 to 14.6% of GDP&#13;
in 1975-80 and a slower increase in public consumption reflecting a high&#13;
incremental savings rate out of disposable income in the 1970s, which&#13;
however has not been sustained uniformly throughout the decade. Despite&#13;
substantial investments in non-departmental enterprises--which include&#13;
most major public enterprises with the exception of Railways, Post and&#13;
Telegraphs, controlled directly by Government Departments--their contribu-&#13;
tion to gross savings remains small, having reached only 1.9% of GDP in&#13;
the period 1978-81. There has also been a marked deterioration in public&#13;
savings in 1979/80 and 1980/81, reflecting the inelasticity of public&#13;
revenues under inflationary conditions. Compared to an average rate of&#13;
3.0% of GDP in the period 1975-79, gross savings of theCentral Government&#13;
declined to 2.1% of GDP in 1979/80 and 1.7% of GDP in 1980/81. 1/&#13;
13.     Measured against the investment and savings experience of the&#13;
1970s, the Plan objectives are high but achievable. India's savings and&#13;
investment have followed an increasing trend which despite some decline in&#13;
saving rates in recent years, is expected to continue in the remainder of&#13;
the Sixth Plan. Nonetheless, a lower rate of increase in savings is&#13;
assumed for 1980-85 because it would be unrealistic to expect the savings&#13;
to continue to increase at the same rate as they did in the 1970s.&#13;
1/ CSOs data for 1980/81 are derived using revised budget estimates&#13;
instead of actual receipts and expenditures. This probably&#13;
under-estimates public savings because in the past it has been&#13;
observed that under inflationary conditions actual receipts tend to&#13;
exceed revised budget estimates by a larger margin than the difference&#13;
between actual and revised budget expenditures.&#13;

III. INTERSECTORAL FINANCING PATTERPNS&#13;
13,     This section reviews intersectoral financing patterns of the&#13;
public and private sectors, the financing of the current account deficit&#13;
and the intermediation role played by the banking system, Detailed annual&#13;
sources-and-uses-of-funds accounts were derived for the perlod 1975/76 to&#13;
1984/85 at current and constant prices although the constant-pr:ce data&#13;
were not reduced to a common base. The annual accounts in the period&#13;
1975-80 are available in 1970/71 prices; the aggregate account for 1975-80&#13;
is also available in 1980/81 prices. All constant price accounts for&#13;
1980-85 are available only at 1980/81 prices.&#13;
140     Public Sector.  Graph 2 portrays real investment and savings in&#13;
the public sector since 1970/71 (at constant 1970/71 prices) and the&#13;
extent to which the public sector has relled on other sectors to finance&#13;
its investment since 1975/76. Public investment increased substantially&#13;
in the 1970s but had two sharp falls, one in 1974/75 following the oil&#13;
crisis, and a much sharper decline in 1977/78o From 1978/79 to 1980/81&#13;
there was a fall in public savings while public investment increased&#13;
continuously0 This has led to an increasing investment-savings gap in the&#13;
public sector, which as percentage of GDP at current market prices&#13;
increased from 4,3% in 1970-75 to 5.3% in 1975-80. In 1975-80 the savings&#13;
investment gap of the public sector was financed by the external sector&#13;
(1o2% of GDP), the private sector 1/ (net lending of 1.1% of CDP) and the&#13;
banking systems (3.0% of GDP; Table 5).&#13;
15.     In spite of a sizeable increase in public savings, public&#13;
investment is anticipated to increase faster in the course of the Sixth&#13;
Plan, thereby increasing the savings-investment gap of the public sector&#13;
to about 7.3% of GDP in 1980-85. The larger savings-investment gap in the&#13;
public sector in 1980-85 confronts a less favorable external environment&#13;
for concessional finance than in the past, and definite limits on the&#13;
extent to which the banking system can accomnodate higher public sector&#13;
borrowing without either displacing credit to the private sector or&#13;
bringing about excess liquidity0 There is some scope for higher net&#13;
borrowing directly from the household sector, as Government has shown in&#13;
the last two years, but it is contingent upon the public sector being able&#13;
to go beyond captive sources of borrowing (small savings and provident&#13;
funds), by offering more attractive terms than in the past in ways which&#13;
can stimulate household savings0 There is greater scope, however, for&#13;
closing the savings-investment gap in the public sector through additional&#13;
resource mobilization measures to be taken withi'n the public sector&#13;
itself. Public savings are expected to finance only 39% of public&#13;

16.     It is not possible to separate fully the financial performance of&#13;
the Central Government or of State Governments from that of&#13;
non-departmental enterprises, since they are closely inter-linked and have&#13;
large financial transfers. In 1975-80, the savings gap of&#13;
non-departmental enterprises was 3.7% of GDP and was financed by the State&#13;
Governments (1.4% of GDP), Central Government (1.2% of GDP), credits from&#13;
the banking system (0.8% of GDP) and only marginally by private savings&#13;
(0.3% of GDP). In turn, the Central Government contributed to the State&#13;
Governments' financing by capital transfers and net loans equivalent to&#13;
about 2.1% of GDP in 1975-80. As a result of these transfers and loans,&#13;
the Central Government--which had a savings-investment gap of only 0.4% of&#13;
GDP in 1975-80-increased its net borrowing requirements to about 3.7% of&#13;
GDP, which were financed by the banking system (1.9% of GDP), foreign&#13;
borrowing and grants (1.2% of GDP) and private sector (0.6% of GDP).&#13;
Undoubtedly, resource mobilization measures designed to reduce the&#13;
borrowing requirements of public sector enterprises would have direct&#13;
repercussions on the finances of Central and State Governments.&#13;

170     Public sector's investment financing at constant prices (Part B of&#13;
Table 5) reveals a somewhat different pattern from that of GDP rates,&#13;
since only the real increase in credit to the public sector is registered&#13;
as financing from the banking system. The effect of inflation, which&#13;
transfers resources from the private sector to the public sector through&#13;
the erosion in the value of private sector's net monetary assets, is&#13;
captured under the heading of "seignorage" (para Aol2)o Table 5 shows&#13;
that seignorage is larger than the direct lending of the private sector to&#13;
the public sector, accounting for about 16% of real public investment in&#13;
1975-80 and for about 20% in 1980-85o Selgnorage was particularly large&#13;
in the period 1980=82 when inflation rates were relatively higlh0&#13;
18o     Private Sectoro While the private savings rate is prolected to&#13;
increase from 17.5% of GDP in 1975-80 to 1807% in 198OQ859 the -)rivate&#13;
investment rate is projected to increase faster, and hence the pnojected&#13;
financial savings rate is slightly lower in 1980=85 (5.0% of GDP as&#13;
compared to 503% in 1975-80) as a result of the decline in financial&#13;
savings rates in 1980-82 (Table 6). A greater share of the firancial&#13;
savings of the private sector will be captured directly by the public&#13;
sector in 1980=85 than in 1975-80 and a correspondingly smaller share will&#13;
be absorbed by the banking system. The Covernment has announced several&#13;
measures designed to stimulate private financial savings, such as new&#13;
savings schemes with higher nominal interest rates$ including the 1981&#13;
six-year Hational Savings Certificate, the 1982 Social Security&#13;
Certificate and the 1982 Capital Investment Bond.&#13;
19o     Only a small fraction of the private sector's financial savings is&#13;
lent directly to the public sector (101% of GDP in 1975=80) Mhile most&#13;
financial savings are channelized through the banking system (Oable 6)o&#13;
This reflects, in a partial sense, a somewhat narrow capital market base&#13;
in India, 1/ although it should be pointed out that our breakdown of the&#13;
economy by sectors ignores the role of financial institutions as&#13;
intermediaries between household savings and enterprises.&#13;
1/ There is, however, an additional transfer of private sectoT's finan-&#13;
cial savings to the public sector due to the effect of inflation on&#13;
net monetary assets, as discussed in pare 17 and shown in Graph 3.&#13;
There was a sharp increase in lending and capital transfers to the&#13;
public sector in 1979/80 as a result of inflation.&#13;

real money supply is projected to increase at about 8.4%, on the basis of&#13;
real expenditure and projected inflation rates (A.15). Despite the lower&#13;
rate of growth, the substantial fall in net foreign assets that will take&#13;
place in 1980-85 will enable a higher growth of credit in real terms to&#13;
both public and private sectors than in 1975-80. The issue of whether&#13;
credit to the private sector in 1981/82 and 1982/83 has been adequate can&#13;
be discussed in the context of the estimates and projections presented&#13;
here. In real terms, credit to the private sector appears to have&#13;
increased by about 11% in 1981/82 and may increase by about 14% in&#13;
1982/83, and although investment demands have also increased there does&#13;
not appear to be a larger financial gap than in the period 1975-80. The&#13;
main difference lies in the much lower share and level of private sector's&#13;
financial savings going through the banking system. 1/&#13;

21o     Foreign Savings. The financing of the current account deficit&#13;
projected for 1980=85 differs markedly from the period 1975-8O0 in which&#13;
foreign exchange assets were accumulated to the tune of 1025% of GDP&#13;
(Table 8)D the current account deficit being negligible in this period.&#13;
In the period 1980=85, the much larger current account deficit (2.3% of&#13;
GDP) will have to be financed by GoverniLent and private borrowing and by&#13;
drawing down net foreign assets (inclusive of INF credit) by about 0.8% of&#13;
GDPo Given the uncertain prospects of concessional aid, GovernEent&#13;
borrowing is expected to have a larger component of commercial borrowingo&#13;

APPENDIX A&#13;
Derivation of Sources and Uses of Funds Accounts&#13;
A.1     CSOs national accounts statistics comprise independent estimates&#13;
of production, consumption and investment and include statistical&#13;
discrepancies to reflect differences in estimation methods. In addition&#13;
to these series, CSO has direct estimates of savings. In order to derive&#13;
a consistent set of these aggregates over time, the interrelations among&#13;
savings, investment and consumption have been taken into account. For any&#13;
given estimate of savings, investment or consumption, the other two would&#13;
follow from accounting identities. CSOs savings estimate was selected as&#13;
the basis for deriving investment and consumption data. CSOs investment&#13;
figure adjusted for statistical discrepancies is itself based on the&#13;
savings estimate.&#13;
A.2     Ministry of Finance economic classification of budgetary&#13;
accounts--based on national income accounts methodology--is available only&#13;
for the Central Government Budget, not for the States. CSO presents&#13;
estimates of net savings and investment for Central and State Governments&#13;
separately, but no breakdown is available for borrowing and lending&#13;
transactions. In case of conflict with other sources, Central Government&#13;
Budget data were used; both savings and investment figures from this&#13;
source were used instead of CSOs estimates. In order to ensure&#13;
consistency of total public and private savings with corresponding CSOs&#13;
figures, the gross savings estimate of non-departmental enterprises was&#13;
correspondingly adjusted to the extent of the difference in the two&#13;
estimates of Central Government savings. Gross savings of State&#13;
Governments were derived on the basis of CSOs net savings, adjusted to&#13;
reflect the consumption of fixed capital. 1/&#13;
A.3     Monetary Accounts.   RBIs adjusted monetary accounts are fully&#13;
consistent with government budget data and reflect the financial position&#13;
as on March 31 on the basis of the closure of government accounts. The&#13;
distribution of "other banks' credit to the government" (i.e. other than&#13;
RBIs credit) between the Centre and States, which is not available from&#13;
RBI's monetary accounts, has been derived on the basis of the proportional&#13;
distribution of commercial banks' credit, available from other RBI&#13;
1/ The latter is estimated as the difference in depreciation estimates&#13;
of General Government and Central Government (assumed to be given by&#13;
the consumption of fixed capital in Railways and Communications),&#13;
which is considered justified in view of the small orders of magnitude&#13;
involved. For example, in 1978/79 the consumption of fixed capital in&#13;
Railways and Communications was Rs 1.56 billion, while the total for&#13;
Central and State Governments was only Rs 2.16 billion, so the remain-&#13;
ing 0.5 has been allocated to the States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30 &#13;
publications. 1/ Met credit to Public Enterprises has been derived as&#13;
the sum of "RBEIs Credit to the commercial sector" (Which consists of loans&#13;
to financial institutions), available from the monetary accounts, and net&#13;
bank credit to non-departmental non-financial enterprises as recorded in&#13;
the accounts of these enterprises, available from RBI's Report On Currency&#13;
and Finance. Bank credit to the private sector has been derived as the&#13;
difference between total bank credit to commercial sector and the credit&#13;
granted to public enterprises0 Net foreign assets of the banking system&#13;
in India's monetary accounts exclude some INF'related items which should&#13;
be included to reflect foreign assets in a consistent way with balance of&#13;
payments categories0 SDR holdings and reserve position at the Fund as of&#13;
March 31, were added to the foreign assets of the banking system, and a&#13;
corresponding adjustment was made to net non-monetary liabilitfes to&#13;
preserve the balance in monetary accountso&#13;
Ao4     Some of the remaining gaps in information regarding State&#13;
Government's capital account have been covered by using other cectors'&#13;
accounts of transactions with State Governments, e.g. Central Government&#13;
loans and transfers0 Data on State Provident Fund are available from the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, while data on borrowing from insurance and&#13;
non-government provident fund through the sale of securities are available&#13;
from RBI's Report on Currency and Finance0 Non-departmental public&#13;
enterprises have been assumed to be the sole recipients of unidentified&#13;
lending by State Governments, since RBI flow-of-funds tables up to 1976/77&#13;
show the State Electricity Boards as the major recipients of State&#13;
loans0 2/&#13;
A05     Estimates of the resource gap (net imports of goods and non-factor&#13;
services) and the current account deficit (foreign savings) were derived&#13;
by the authors on the basis of commodity trade data supplemented by the&#13;
inclusion of imports of merchaat ships, and current transfers and net&#13;
factor service payments from abroad; they are consistently higher than&#13;
RBIs estimates based on payments data0 The capital account of the balance&#13;
of payments was derived on the basis of total net capital inflow (foreign&#13;
savings), net inflow to the government from the Central Budget (assuming&#13;
no net inflows to public enterprises or State Governments) , and net change&#13;
1/ The proportional distribution of Commercial Banks' Credit was derived&#13;
by aggregating two categories:   a) `credit `  from RBI Banking Statis°&#13;
tics (a half-yearly publication) and b) "investments" from RBI Statis-&#13;

in reserves from the monetary accounts; net inflow to the private sector&#13;
was derived as the residual.&#13;
A.6     In general, the private sector account has been treated as a&#13;
residual account in the sources and uses of funds system, in which other&#13;
sectors' transactions with unspecified source or destination of funds have&#13;
been attributed to it. Capital transactions of public enterprises and the&#13;
private sector are generally covered by the Central Government Budget,&#13;
State Governments' Budgets and the Monetary accounts, except for the&#13;
transactions between these sectors. The transactions between public&#13;
enterprises and private sector consist of flows from households to public&#13;
financial enterprises (life insurance, provident fund), flows from public&#13;
financial enterprises to private corporations (long-term loans), flows&#13;
from private corporations to public non-financial enterprises (shares,&#13;
trade credit), and various miscellaneous items. Data are readily&#13;
available only for life insurance and provident fund, which has been&#13;
assumed to represent lending from the private sector to public&#13;
enterprises. Borrowing by private sector from public enterprises has been&#13;
derived simultaneously as the balancing item in the capital accounts of&#13;
both sectors.&#13;
A.7     Constant Price Estimates.   To assess the extent of real changes&#13;
over time, the sources and uses of funds accounts have been converted to&#13;
constant 1970/71 prices. However, there is no generally accepted overall&#13;
deflator for intersectoral flows and it could be argued that each sector&#13;
and transaction should have a different deflator, allowing for&#13;
intersectoral terms of trade gains and losses. Such an approach would&#13;
have several disadvantages and it may be practically impossible to&#13;
implement because of data limitations. 1/&#13;
A.8     The deflation procedures used in this paper are as follows.    Terms&#13;
of trade losses attributable to lower increases in export prices than&#13;
import prices have been fully taken into account as these affect the level&#13;
of gross domestic income (GDY, equivalent to GDP corrected for terms of&#13;
trade losses). The terms of trade correction amounts to deflating export&#13;
values by import prices (and deriving the effective loss in the purchasing&#13;
power of exports); this procedure has been extended to all balance of&#13;

payments categories. 1/ Current transfers frem abroad plus ne': factor&#13;
payments from abroad, deflated by import prices, were added to GVDY to&#13;
derive real gross national disposable income (GHDI), which measures the&#13;
overall purchasing power available to the country from national sources&#13;
(ioe., gross national savings plus consumption expenditure)o AA excess of&#13;
real expenditure (comprising consumption and investment) over GXDI&#13;
reflects an excess of investment over gross national savingg, or a current&#13;
account deficit to be financed by inflows from abroad0&#13;
A09     Investment at constant prices was derived by deflating the&#13;
corresponding current price estimate (pare Aol) by CSOs implicic price&#13;
deflator (ipd) of gross capital formation. Real gross national. savings&#13;
was obtained as the difference between real investment and the c.urrent&#13;
account deficit (the latter deflated by the ipd of imports)0 The ipd of&#13;
gross national savings was used in deflating pr'vate and public savings&#13;
at current prices. Real savings so obtained plus real consumption led to&#13;
disposable income of public and private sectors respectively. iotal&#13;
consumption was obtained as domestic expenditure minus investment.&#13;
Private consumption was derived as residual after subtracting CSOs data&#13;
on public consumption at constant prices.&#13;
A010    To derive GDY by sectors the ipd of GDY was applied to the&#13;
corresponding current price estimates of GDPo The intersectoral flows&#13;
that are not income but transfers were derived implicitly, by assuming&#13;
that each sector's receipts have the same implicit deflator irrespectively&#13;
of the source0 A simultaneous equation system was then solved to derive&#13;
the implicit price deflators and real intersectoral transfers that assured&#13;
consistency with real income and saving patterns derived earlier0 The&#13;
following matrix describes the price deflators used in each category and&#13;
I/ The indices of export and import prices used In this calcu'ation are&#13;
derived from exports and imports of coamodities valued f.o.b. and&#13;
c.iofo, respectively, instead of the actual values of traded com-&#13;
modities and non-factor services which enter the production accounts0&#13;
In addition, changes in the compositIon of exports and imports over&#13;
time may lead to inaccuracies in the use of fixedweight price&#13;
indices0 See Paul Hgst-Madsen Macroeconomic Accounts: An Overviews&#13;

A.11    The capital account of the sources and uses of funds system adopts&#13;
the sectoral savings and aggregate investment derived in the current&#13;
account.   Sectoral investment is derived by using the ipd of investment.&#13;
The capital account of the balance of payments is deflated by the import&#13;
price deflator. All other flows are deflated by the ipd of investment&#13;
except for monetary accounts, and some residual categories (involving the&#13;
private sector) that were necessary to offset the use of other deflators&#13;
in other categories. The rationale for using the investment deflator is&#13;
1/ The subscripts GDY, M, I, E, NS and CC stand respectively for Gross&#13;
Domestic Income, imports, investment, expenditure, gross national&#13;
savings, and public consumption.   P    and P s are the&#13;
implicit deflators of current flowsgfrom otRer sectors to general&#13;
government and private sector respectively. A similar deflator for&#13;
public enterprises could have been listed in the second row, except&#13;
that these transactions have been netted out of public enterprises'&#13;
payments to other sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34 -&#13;
that most capital transactions-including those of the banking system-are&#13;
designed to transfer savings from one sector to another to finance&#13;
investment. There is an important difference regarding the deflation of&#13;
monetary stock variables; in general, the nominal increase in mcney supply&#13;
deflated by the investment deflator will not be an accurate measure of the&#13;
real increase in money supply since the unit value of the stocks at the&#13;
beginning and end of a given year will be different. The real increase&#13;
in money supply in year t (in terms of investment prices) has been&#13;
calculated as the difference between the money stock at the end of fiscal&#13;
year t deflated by the average investment price level in year t, and the&#13;
money stock at the end of year t-I deflated by the investment price index&#13;
of year t-1. 1/ A similar procedure has been followed to calculate the&#13;
real increase in credit to public and private sectors. The only exception&#13;
is that changes in net foreign assets have been directly deflated by the&#13;
import price. This means, in effect, that capital gains or losses due to&#13;
changes in the valuation of foreign assets, being of an unrealized nature,&#13;
are excluded from the real flow of foreign assets, and absorbed in the&#13;
residual category (non-monetary liabilities)o The following matrix&#13;
summarizes the price deflators used in the capital account0&#13;
1/ Instead of using the average price level of a given year q.t would have&#13;
been preferable to use the price level prevailing at the end of each&#13;
fiscal year to deflate the stock values0 Unfortunately lack of&#13;
sufficiently broad end-of-year price indices-as would be derived&#13;
from quarterly data on national income accounts--prevented the&#13;
adoption of this approach0&#13;

A.12     Derivation of Constant Price Series for Private Sector Capital&#13;
Account. The destination of the savings investment surplus (i.e.&#13;
financial savings) of the private sector in nominal terms is as follows:&#13;
S - I = DLPu +      DLBS + DLA                            (I)&#13;
where S is Private Savings, I is Private Investment, DLPu is direct&#13;
private lending to Public Sector (i.e. not through the banking system),&#13;
L DLBS is increase in net lending by the private sector to the banking&#13;
system 1/ and DLA is direct lending abroad. In real terms, the&#13;
destination of this financial savings acquires special importance since&#13;
there are capital gains and losses arising from inflation. Define&#13;
respectively the nominal and real increase in net indebtedness of the&#13;
banking system towards the private sector as follows:&#13;
1/ Reflects the net increase in indebtedness of the banking system towards&#13;
the private sector, composed of increase in money supply (M3) minus&#13;
increase in domestic credit to private sector plus increase in&#13;
non-monetary liabilities of the banking system.&#13;

banking system towards Ehe private sector at the end of year t , and&#13;
Pt is the investment price index for year to From (II), after transferring&#13;

t  t             t  t         t-1  t&#13;

t    t            t               t-I&#13;
where INF = (Pt-Pt'l)/P t0    In other words, the nominal increase in net&#13;
lending to the banking system in year t is equal to the real increase in&#13;
lending multiplied by the current price leveI, plus the inflatlon rate&#13;
INF multiplied by the outstanding net debt (in nominal terms as of the end&#13;
of year t-1) of the banking system towards the private sector. The last&#13;
term measures the erosion due to inflation in the nominal net indebtedness&#13;
of the banking system towards the private sector0    When deflated by Pt it&#13;
measures the real loss (at base-period prices) incurred by the pzivate&#13;
sector in its net monetary assets on account of Inflation, which we will&#13;
later describe as Bseignorage".O Replacing (v) in (I) and deflating&#13;
all terms by Pt 1/ we get&#13;

P  = P ), the real savings-investment surplus of the private sector can be&#13;
seen to correspond readily to the current-price categories established in&#13;
(I), except for the second and third terms on the right hand side of&#13;
(VII). The third term is the only one attributed to the banking system,&#13;
whereas the seignorage term is really seen as a transfer to the public&#13;
sector (in the form of an inflation tax). 1/ The seignorage effect plus&#13;
1/  In countries with high inflation rates, interest rates reflect a premium&#13;
for anticipated inflation. Some assets and liabilities of the&#13;
banking system towards the private sector are subject to interest rates,&#13;
e.g. time deposits on the liabilities side and credit&#13;
to the private sector on the assets side. To the extent that the&#13;
interest rates on these reflect anticipated inflation, only unanticipated&#13;
inflation rates applied to these assets and liabilities plus inflation&#13;
rate applied to the remaining net monetary assets not bearing interest,&#13;
would be "seignorage" in India. Bank interest rates are subject to&#13;
statutory limits which may or may not reflect anticipated inflation&#13;
rates. In general, however, India's inflation rates have been&#13;
moderate (average annual rate is lower than 10%). For these reasons,&#13;
all monetary assets and liabilities have been treated as bearing no&#13;
interest premium to reflect inflation, although this may overestimate&#13;
the measure of seignorage.&#13;

A.13    Projections. Consistent estimates and projections fo7 s..he Sixth&#13;
Plan period 1980-85 were derived by means of a simplified set of relations&#13;
and assumptions. Although more elaborate projections are of ccurse&#13;
possible and desirable, the purpose of fulLy reflecting in the "rojections&#13;
the interlinkages between national income accounts, balance of payments&#13;
and intersectoral financial flows can be underscored better th-ough a&#13;
simplified set of assumptions. The overall resource situatlon w^as&#13;
projected in real terms; GDP at constant market prices was assumed to grow&#13;
at rates similar to the ones assumed in the Sixth Plan. GDP inflator is&#13;
projected assuming a gradually decreasing Inflatlon rate, from 8.5% in&#13;
1982/83 to 7.5% in 1984/850 The overall expenditure deflator -s derived&#13;
implicitly. CSO estimates were used for S980/81 and authors' estimates&#13;
based on sectoral performance for L981/82. Export, imports an6 resource&#13;
gap projections were based on sectoral commodity projections ircorporating&#13;
anticipated changes in import substitution and export patterns which are&#13;
expected to reduce the current deficit over time.&#13;
Aol4    Aggregate real investment for the period 1980-85 is assumed to be&#13;
the same as in the Plan, converted from 1979/80 prices to 1980/81 prices&#13;
through the implicit price deflator of gross domestic capital formation0&#13;
Since overall expenditure and the level of investment are predetermIned,&#13;
real consumption follows as a residual0 T'o estimate real gross national&#13;
savings, it is necessary to derive first an estimate of real gross&#13;
national disposable income, which includes in addition to GDY (GDP&#13;
converted for terms of trade), net current transfers from abroad and net&#13;
factor payments from abroad, both of which were deflated using the&#13;
implicit import deflator0 Implicit import and export prices are also&#13;
derived to measure the extent of terms of trade losses over time0 The&#13;
import deflator is also used as the deflator of all balance of payments&#13;
categories0 Real gross national savings can then be derived as that part&#13;
of real income which is not consumed (real gross national disposable&#13;
income minus consumption) or real investment minus the current account&#13;
deficit deflated by import price0 2/ This estimate is the rate of&#13;
savings necessary to implement the investment program given the overall&#13;
I/ In the sources and uses of funds accounts, the savings and impcrt&#13;
deflator adjustments are also included in the total capita:'&#13;
resources claimed by the public sector from the private sectoro&#13;
2/ Notice that the current account deficit so derived is also equivalent&#13;
to the resource gap minus net current transfers from abroad and net&#13;
factor payments from abroad, when all terms are properly deflated by&#13;
the import price0&#13;

resource situation. Public savings as percentage of GDP at current market&#13;
prices is projected to increase from 4.2% in 1981/82 to about 6.1% in&#13;
1984/85. Private savings requirements are then derived as a residual. 1/&#13;
The breakdown of investment between public and private sector assumes an&#13;
increasing public investment rate. For the period 1980-85 the share of&#13;
the public sector in total investment is about 47%, slightly lower than&#13;
the 53% share assumed in the Sixth Plan.&#13;
A.15    Overall money supply growth consistent with predicted real&#13;
expenditure patterns and projected price increases is derived using a&#13;
demand function for real monetary balances estimated for the period&#13;
1/ A regression equation explaining variations in real private savings&#13;
(RPS) in terms of real private disposable income (RPDI) for the&#13;
period 1970/71 to 1980/81 led to a marginal savings rate of 33%:&#13;
RPS = -57.244 + 0.33 RPDI            R     0.92&#13;
(-4.42)   (10.17)            SEE = 4.53&#13;
DW = 2.39&#13;
When converted from 1970/71 prices to current prices, the savings&#13;
rates projected on the basis of this equation were somewhat higher&#13;
than the required savings rates. Nonetheless, the savings experience&#13;
of the 1970s was somewhat exceptional and it may not be legitimate&#13;
to project on that basis specially in view of the fall in saving rates&#13;
observed in 1979/80 and 1980/81.&#13;

also recovered to 101% of GDPmp in 1981/82o In view of the various&#13;
schemes introduced recently by the Government to attract private savings&#13;
for public investment (such as the six-year Wational Savings Certificate&#13;
introduced in 1981, the Social Security Certificate and Capital Investment&#13;
Bond introduced in February 1982), net direct borrowing from the private&#13;
sector is projected to rise to 109% of GDP in 1982/83, 2.5% in '.983/84 and&#13;
2.8% in 1984/85.&#13;

to fill the residual borrowing requirements of the public sector0 Given&#13;

where M is M3 at the end of year t (March 31 data after closure of&#13;
Government Accounts), p is overall expenditure deflator (base&#13;
1970/71) during year t, Et is real expenditure in year t at 1970/71&#13;
prices, and A is expected inflation (measured as the a-verage annual&#13;
inflation rate (in %) between year t and t-2). The variable (M/P)t-1&#13;
reflects the partial adjustment of desired to actual monetary balan-&#13;
ces. Numbers in parentheses are t-raties. All the coefficients are&#13;
statistically significant and have the right sign. Real expenditure&#13;
is projected to increase at about 4% per annum in the perIod 1982/83&#13;
till 1984/85. The expenditure deflator ic expected to increase at&#13;
8.5% in 1982/83, declining gradually to 7.5% in 1984/85. The&#13;
expected inflation rate is assumed to decline gradually from an&#13;
estimated rate of 1404% in 1980/81 to about 1000% in 1984/85. These&#13;
rates are compatible with the projected price levels0&#13;

Note: The assumptions and methodology used in deriving estimates and projections are&#13;
described in detail in Appendix A. The overall expenditure inflator increases at&#13;
a higher rate than the GDP inflator on account of terms of trade losses, Investment&#13;
at 1980/81 prices (Table 2.4) has been converted to current prices using an implicit&#13;
price index which increases at a slightly higher rate (1% point per annum) than the&#13;
overall expenditure inflator. This long-term trend is confirmed by CSO data.&#13;

            The financing of investment in India,
            1975-85 : a sources and uses of fund approach
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper presents sources and uses of
            funds accounts integrated in a macroeconomic framework for
            analyzing financing patterns and economic interdependence
            among sectors in India, contrasting the period 1975-80 with
            the Sixth Plan period 1980-85. To achieve compatibility and
            consistency of data, national accounts, monetary accounts,
            Central and State Government budgets and the balance of
            payments are integrated into this setting. This framework is
            also used as a programming tool linking the financial and
            real flows of the economy to derive consistent projections
            for the Sixth Plan, not only in terms of aggregate output,
            savings and investment assumptions, but also regarding
            inflation, the rate of monetary expansion and intersectoral
            financing patterns, which have highlighted some economic
            policy issues and options.
