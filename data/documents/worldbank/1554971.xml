REGIONAL ASPECTS OF FAMILY PLANNING AND&#13;
FERTILITY BEHAVIOR IN INDONESIA&#13;
This paper discusses the recent decline in the population growth rate&#13;
of Indonesia which has been achieved at a relatively low level of income&#13;
and socio-economic development. Evidence is presented of this decline which&#13;
is largely attributed to the fall in the total fertility rate in Java-Bali.&#13;
The much higher growth rate of population in the Outer Islands remains a&#13;
matter of concern and the paper accordingly focuses on differences between&#13;
Java-Bali and the Outer Islands.&#13;
The paper briefly reviews the history and organization of the family&#13;
planning program in Indonesia, attempts to identify those factors which&#13;
have been responsible for its success and to assess its prospects for the&#13;
future.  It then presents the results of a multivariate analysis, using&#13;
data from the 1976 Intercensal Population Survey, which attempts to explain&#13;
fertility behavior and family planning practice by socio-economic factors as&#13;
well as the availability of family planning services.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION&#13;
This paper discusses one of the unique elements of recent Indonesian&#13;
development: the decline in its population growth rate which has been achieved&#13;
at a relatively low level of income and socio-economic development.&#13;
The paper presents evidence of this decline which has been in large&#13;
part attributed to the fall in the total fertility rate in Java-Bali. The&#13;
much higher growth rate of population in the Outer Islands, which contain over&#13;
one-third of the population of Indonesia at present but whose contribution to&#13;
future population growth will become increasingly important, remains a matter&#13;
of concern. Indeed, a major focus of the paper is on the many aspects which&#13;
differentiate Java-Bali and the Outer Islands.&#13;
The family planning program in Indonesia has attracted a great deal&#13;
of attention; it has been credited by many for the impressive decline in&#13;
fertility on Java-Bali. This paper briefly reviews the history and organ-&#13;
ization of the program, attempts to identify those factors which have been&#13;
responsible for its success and to assess its prospects for the future. It&#13;
concludes that the strong political commitment, the organizational structure&#13;
and approach of the program, and the efforts to ensure adequate provision of&#13;
contraceptives, coupled with a favorable socio-economic environment in some&#13;
instances, have accounted for the wide acceptance of the program. However,&#13;
because some changes in the organization of the program had to be made in&#13;
the Outer Islands, particularly with regard to the role of the field workers&#13;
there, it is not clear at present that the performance of the program in&#13;
Java-Bali can be readily replicated in the Outer Islands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The paper presents the results of a first attempt to explain fer-&#13;
tility behavior and family planning practice by socio-economic factors as well&#13;
as the family planning program. It concludes that socio-economic factors do&#13;
influence fertility behavior. At low levels of income and education, an&#13;
improvement in these is associated with higher fertility. However, at higher&#13;
levels of income and education, the association is negative. Information&#13;
gathered during the 1976 Intercensal Population Survey suggests that the use&#13;
of family planning is associated with the number of living children that a&#13;
woman has, so that the women who seek family planning services are those who&#13;
have completed their desired family size. However, more recent family plan-&#13;
ning program data indicate that the average family size of women seeking the&#13;
services of the program is declining and that services are being sought earlier&#13;
in marriage. One of the major achievements of the program appears to be that&#13;
it has made family planning accessible to the lower socio-economic groups and&#13;
lower parity women in Java-Bali; use of modern program methods is not strongly&#13;
associated with socio-economic factors there.&#13;
The Outer Islands do not account for as great a proportion of the&#13;
population of Indonesia as Java-Bali, but they do account for over one-third.&#13;
Moreover, this proportion is growing through a higher population growth rate.&#13;
Family planning has been slower in coming to the Outer Islands and the logis-&#13;
tics of reaching a population which is widely scattered will represent quite a&#13;
challenge. There is no evidence that the program will face religious or&#13;
socio-cultural obstacles in the Outer Islands and it seems clear that the&#13;
focus of the struggle to hold down the size of the population of Indonesia&#13;
requires increasing emphasis on extending the program in the Outer Islands.&#13;

Regional Aspects of Family Planning and Fertility Behavior in Indonesia&#13;
1.   Introduction&#13;
The population of Indonesia at the end of 1979 was estimated to&#13;
be 140 million, making it the fifth most populous country in the world.&#13;
While Indonesia as a whole is not a densely populated country, its popula-&#13;
tion is very unevenly distributed across the different islands, as can be&#13;
seen in Table 1. While the population density outside Java and Bali is&#13;
under 50 persons per square kilometer for nearly all the islands, it is over&#13;
600 persons per square kilometer in Java and 400 persons per square kilometer&#13;
in Bali. Thus Java, with 7% of the total land area in contrast with 63% of&#13;
the population, is one of the most densely populated regions in the world,&#13;
comparable to Bangladesh. Historically, Indonesia has had a high growth rate&#13;
of population. In the period 1961-1966, the crude birth rate was 46 per&#13;
thousand population, so that, given a crude death rate of 25 per thousand, the&#13;
population was growing at an annual rate of 2.1%. Finally, the population of&#13;
Indonesia is poor; in 1979, its income per capita was U.S. $370. Moreover,&#13;
the more crowded islands of Java and Bali have a lower standard of living than&#13;
many areas in the Outer Islands. All these considerations add up to a serious&#13;
population problem for Indonesia.&#13;
On the brighter side, between 1971 and 1976, the average annual&#13;
growth rate of population of 2.0% was substantially lower than the rate of&#13;
2.5-2.6% which had been predicted (Iskander, 1976; Speare, 1976). However,&#13;
there was a disparity in growth rates between Java, where it was 1.7%, and&#13;

Intergovernmental Group on Indonesia in Amsterdam in May 1980.&#13;

the Outer Islands where it was 2.6%. There has apparently been a decline&#13;
in fertility rates in Indonesia which has taken place primarily in Java and&#13;
Bali (Hull, Hull and Singarimbun, 1977; Jones, 1977).&#13;
This decline in fertility rates in Java-Bali is noteworthy for two&#13;
reasons. Firstly, it took place at a relatively low level of income and&#13;
socio-economic development. Secondly, it coincided with the implementation&#13;
of the family planning program.&#13;
Indonesia has an income level which is considerably lower than&#13;
those of neighboring countries. It has not experienced rapid urbanization&#13;
or industrialization: 82% of the population live in rural areas and 62%&#13;
of the labor force are engaged in agricultural activities. As in the great&#13;
majority of countries at Indonesia's income level, social development has&#13;
been relatively limited. Nearly two in five adults, and over half of adult&#13;
women, are illiterate. Primary education is by no means universal, secondary&#13;
school enrollment is around 20% and only a small minority receives education&#13;
beyond the secondary level. Life expectancy at birth is under 50 and infant&#13;
mortality remains high; in 1976 the infant mortality rate was estimated to be&#13;
110 per 1,000 live births. The population per physician ratio in 1979 was&#13;
13,198 and only 12% of the population had access to safe water in 1975.&#13;
The family planning program in Indonesia was initiated in Java&#13;
and Bali in 1970 and extended to the Outer Islands in 1974. While much credit&#13;
should be given to the program for the observed fertility decline, it is also&#13;
appropriate to note the importance of the socio-economic changes which are&#13;
currently taking place in Indonesia. Notwithstanding the relatively low level&#13;
of social development noted above, changes in standards of living, levels of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4-&#13;
educational attainment, and labor force participation, particularly that of&#13;
women, have been remarkably rapid. Separation of the effects of the program&#13;
and the socio-economic changes is extremely difficult.&#13;
This paper takes up some of these important issues. The next&#13;
section presents some evidence on recent demographic trends and discusses&#13;
the implications of these trends for the future. Section three gives a brief&#13;
history and description of the family planning program in Indonesia, and&#13;
evaluates both its success to date and its future prospects. Given the dis-&#13;
parate features of Java-Bali and the Outer Islands in many respects, some&#13;
attention will be paid to regional differences. Against this background,&#13;
section four presents the results of an exploratory study of the demogra-&#13;
phic and socio-economic correlates of family planning practice and fertility&#13;
behavior in Indonesia. The study is based on an analysis of primary data&#13;
at the household level from the second round of the Intercensal Population&#13;
Survey for Indonesia (SUPAS II) which was carried out during February-March&#13;
1976. The study is a first attempt to analyse household-level data for the&#13;
Outer Islands as well as Java-Bali.&#13;
2. Recent Demographic Trends in Indonesia&#13;
The growth rate of a population is determined by three factors:&#13;
births, deaths and migration.&#13;
Migration has a negligible effect on the overall growth rate of&#13;
the population of Indonesia. In 1976, the total foreign population living&#13;
in the country was 1.1 million, or less than 1% of the total population.&#13;
No estimate is available of the number of Indonesians living abroad, but&#13;
it is not believed to be great. Migration also has only a small effect on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
the population growth rate by island. Both the 1971 Census and the 1976&#13;
Intercensal Population Survey indicate that net inter-island migration&#13;
flows are small. Between 1971 and 1976, the net migration from Java to the&#13;
Outer Islands was of the order of 0.1% of the population of Java. Rural-&#13;
urban migration is more substantial since, given that there is no evidence&#13;
of significant differences in fertility and mortality rates between urban&#13;
and rural areas of a region (Chernichovsky, Newlon and Sigit, 1978), and a&#13;
roughly comparable age structure, it must have accounted for the difference&#13;
between the urban population annual growth rate of 2.6% and the rural rate&#13;
of 1.8% (World Bank Report, 1980).&#13;
Recent surveys provide sufficient data to establish regional fer-&#13;
tility rates, but not mortality rates. 1/ The most widely accepted mortality&#13;
rates for Java and the Outer Islands are those produced by Chandrasekaran&#13;
and Suharto (Chandrasekaran and SuhartQ, 1978) which were based on the 23&#13;
provinces covered by the Intercensal Population Survey of 1976 and are&#13;
shown in Table 2. These estimates have also been used as the basis for&#13;
the most recent population projections, which are given in Table 3. 2/&#13;
Table 2 provides a useful contrast between the demographic situa-&#13;
tions in Java and the Outer Islands over the 1971-75 period. The annual&#13;
growth rate of population of 1.7% in Java resulted from a birth rate of 37&#13;
I/   It is possible to deduce mortality rates from the regional growth and&#13;
fertility rates given in Table 1.    However, such a calculation assumes&#13;
no net migration between two regions, and cannot be considered to give&#13;
reliable estimates.&#13;

per thousand, a death rate of 18 per thousand and a net out-migration rate&#13;
of 0.1%; in the Outer Islands the growth rate of 2.6% was the outcome of a&#13;
much higher birth rate of 47 per thousand, a higher death rate of 23 per&#13;
thousand and a net in-migration rate of 0.2%. The implications of a con-&#13;
tinuation of these statistics are that the population of the Outer Islands&#13;
could overtake that of Java within a few decades. As shown in Table 3, the&#13;
Outer Islands accounted for 36% of the population of Indonesia in 1971. By&#13;
the end of the century they will account for 42%. After the mid-1980s, the&#13;
contribution of the Outer Islands to the absolute increase in population will&#13;
exceed that of Java.&#13;
The evidence is conclusive that fertility has declined in Java and&#13;
Bali. 1/ Table 4 presents total fertility rates 2/ (TFR) for the period&#13;
1967-71 and 1976 for Java and Bali. The figures show an overall decline&#13;
in the TFR from 5.3 children per woman to 4.5, representing a drop of 15%&#13;
between 1971 and 1976.&#13;
Changes in fertility are attributable, either singly or in varying&#13;
combinations, to three factors: changes in marital fertility; changes in&#13;
marriage patterns, that is, variations in age at marriage and/or propor-&#13;
tions married; and changes in the overall age composition of the population.&#13;
Two measures of marital fertility are analyzed to evaluate changes&#13;
in marital fertility rates. These are the age-specific marital fertility&#13;
1/   Comparable information is not available for the Outer Islands.&#13;
2/   The total fertility rate is the mean number of births a woman will&#13;
have throughout her reproductive life if the prevailing age-specific&#13;
fertility rates continue.&#13;

rates (ASMFR) and Coale's Index of Marital Fertility (I ) 1/ which are&#13;
presented in Table Al. Between 1971 and 1976, ASMFRs declined in the older&#13;
age-segments, starting from the age group 25-29 years, while increasing&#13;
among younger women. These declines became sharper with increasing age,&#13;
thus conforming with the patterns of fertility decline in other developing&#13;
countries: women who have achieved their desired family size are more&#13;
likely to avail themselves of the opportunity to limit their fertility&#13;
by means of contraceptive methods, when such services are readily available.&#13;
Nevertheless, the almost precipitous decline for women over 40 is unusual,&#13;
because these women have been found in many other countries to be more&#13;
likely to resist innovations such as family planning.&#13;
Whenever marital fertility, as measured by Coale's I , is equal&#13;
to or greater than 0.64, then it reflects natural fertility, that is fer-&#13;
tility among married couples uncontrolled by contraception. In the late&#13;
1960s, Bali, Jakarta and West Java were experiencing natural fertility levels&#13;
(see Table Al). By 1976, only West Java had fertility levels approaching&#13;
the natural level (.628). Elsewhere there was no decrease in the marital&#13;
fertility level in Yogyakarta between the late 1960s and 1976, a sharp decline&#13;
in Bali, and moderate declines in the remaining provinces, as well as in Java&#13;
and Bali as a whole.&#13;
1/   The index of marital fertility (I ) is defined as the number of births&#13;
of currently married women relatihe to the number they would bear if&#13;
subject to Hutterite marital fertility rates, the Hutterites being the&#13;
most prolific sizable population for which there are reliable statistics.&#13;
The index is confined to the interval zero to one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
As noted above, the decline in fertility is also due to changes in&#13;
age at marriage and proportions married. As may be seen from Table A2, there&#13;
is a decline in the proportion of women currently married, as measured by&#13;
Coale's Index of Proportion Married (I ), 1/ from .75 in 1971 to .71 in 1976&#13;
for Java and Bali. This overall decline in proportion married occurred&#13;
through a very noticeable reduction in the percent of women currently married&#13;
in the youngest age groups (15-29). These shifts in the proportions marrying&#13;
are also reflected in the rise in the mean age at marriage (SMAM), which&#13;
increased in Java and Bali from 18.7 in 1971 to 19.4 in 1976.&#13;
Changes in marital fertility have been advanced as the most sig-&#13;
nificant contributory factor to the decline in the TFR for Java and Bali.&#13;
According to Sinquefield and Sungkono (1977:48), fully 70% of the decline&#13;
in fertility between 1971 and 1976 was due to a reduction in marital fer-&#13;
tility, with most of the remainder (30%) explained by rising age at marriage.&#13;
In conclusion, the evidence establishes that fertility has declined&#13;
in Java and Bali. However, the higher population growth rate of the Outer&#13;
Islands implies that they will contribute more and more to the population&#13;
problem of Indonesia in the future.&#13;
3. The Family Planning Program&#13;
Indonesia has been widely acclaimed for its successful family&#13;
planning (FP) program. As already indicated, the growth rate of population&#13;
has declined in recent years, with much of the decline taking place in Java&#13;
1/   The index of proportion married (I ) is defined as the number of children&#13;
that married women would produce relative to the number that all women&#13;
would produce if both sets of women experienced the Hutterite fertility&#13;
schedule. The index is confined to the interval zero to one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
and Bali. While these results are impressive, it is necessary to view&#13;
the FP program in its entirety in order to identify the factors that contri-&#13;
buted to the success of the program. Special mention should be made of the&#13;
strong and sustained political commitment to the FP program; the historical&#13;
context of the program; the organizational structure, to which much of the&#13;
success of the program has been attributed; and the efforts to ensure ade-&#13;
quate provision of contraceptives at all levels of distribution. This paper&#13;
considers the importance of some of these factors, examines various statis-&#13;
tics, and provides an evaluation of the program, emphasizing the extent of&#13;
the success of the program in Java-Bali and the factors that contributed to&#13;
the success, as well as future prospects of the program both in Java-Bali&#13;
and the Outer Islands.&#13;
3.1 Historical Context of the Family Planning Program&#13;
In the early years of independence, a pronatalist policy was&#13;
adopted under President Sukarno, and transmigration to the relatively sparsely&#13;
populated Outer Islands was advocated as a solution to the perceived popu-&#13;
lation problem of overcrowding on Java-Bali. Birth control was viewed as&#13;
unnecessary except for the purposes of spacing births in order to preserve&#13;
the health of the nation's mothers (U.N., 1978:11). It was considered that,&#13;
in the long run, fertility would decline as economic development progressed.&#13;
Consequently, no direct governmental action was taken to reduce the high&#13;
level of fertility. In addition, dissemination of information on birth&#13;
control and the distribution of contraceptives to the public was prohibited&#13;
by law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
With the change of government in March 1966, the population problem&#13;
was viewed from a different perspective. According to this point of view,&#13;
the population growth rate of around 2% per annum, although moderate by&#13;
developing country standards, nevertheless affected the country's socio-&#13;
economic development by putting excessive pressure on available natural&#13;
resources and by contributing to the problem of unemployment. In addition,&#13;
it constrained desired income redistribution, affected savings generation&#13;
and hampered the effectiveness of capital investment (UNFPA-UN, 1979).&#13;
Therefore, the official population policy was changed from the previously&#13;
pronatalist stance to one of explicit support for a national program of&#13;
birth control.&#13;
3.2 Organizational Structure&#13;
Against the setting outlined above, the initial steps towards&#13;
a national FP program were taken not by politicians but by community leaders&#13;
and influential groups who saw a need for such services for individuals,&#13;
quite apart from any effect that it would have on the population problem.&#13;
Scattered services were provided to a mainly urban clientele by a number of&#13;
agencies which were forged into the Indonesian Planned Parenthood Association&#13;
(PKBI) in 1957 (Hull, Hull and Singarimbun, 1977). The PKBI continued to&#13;
expand until the mid 1960s, when political turmoil forced it to abandon its&#13;
services. With the advent of the new government in 1966, and freed from&#13;
the earlier restraints of hostile press coverage and lack of government&#13;
support, the PKBI reopened its clinics, and over the next two years paved&#13;
the way for the adoption of family planning as an official government policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
In 1968, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) formally adopted family&#13;
planning as a national program with an explicit policy to reduce the popula-&#13;
tion growth rate. A National Family Planning Coordinating Board (NFPCB) was&#13;
established in 1970 to plan and coordinate the FP program which was at first&#13;
restricted to Java-Bali, extended to 10 provinces in the Outer Islands in&#13;
1974, and to the remaining 11 provinces of the country in 1979.&#13;
The administrative structure of the FP program is presented in&#13;
Figure 1. The President assumes personal responsibility for the progress&#13;
of the program. On policy matters he is advised by a council of ministers,&#13;
chaired by the State Minister for Peoples Welfare. The NFPCB is a fully&#13;
governmental body (unlike its predecessor, the semi-autonomous Family Plan-&#13;
ning Institute) with a chairman, four deputy chairmen, who are in charge of&#13;
eleven bureaus representing various staff functions, and a secretariat to&#13;
provide administrative and financial support. The chairman reports directly&#13;
to the President. Actual implementation of the program activities is vested&#13;
in various concerned governmental ministries (the most important of which&#13;
is the Ministry of Health), as well as the armed forces, various voluntary&#13;
organizations and universities which carry out research and pilot studies.&#13;
Similar structures exist at the provincial and kabupaten (regency)&#13;
levels, which form the operational base of the program. Insofar as the&#13;
governors are responsible to the President for the development programs&#13;
within their administrative areas, and since FP forms an integral part of&#13;
the nation's development plans (UN, 1978), they are also responsible for&#13;
the FP program.&#13;

A salient feature of the Indonesian FP administration which accounts&#13;
in some measure for the success of the program is the operational decentral-&#13;
ization involved in the elaborate process of program development and imple-&#13;
mentation. The chairman of the NFPCB, after considerable discussion with the&#13;
senior and mid-level officials of the central and provincial NFPCBs and imple-&#13;
menting units, enunciates a national policy. Programs responsive to local&#13;
conditions are then formulated by the provincial NFPCBs in collaboration with&#13;
various government ministries, kabupaten NFPCBs and private organizations.&#13;
After approval of the governor has been obtained, it is presented to the&#13;
central NFPCB as the provincial program. Once the NFPCB has approved and&#13;
funded these plans, implementation devolves on the agency which proposed&#13;
them.&#13;
Two types of services are offered by the family planning program:&#13;
Information, Education and Communication (IEC), and medical. The community&#13;
education program, directed and supervised at the national level by the&#13;
Special Bureau of Field Workers, is planned and coordinated at the provincial&#13;
level and implemented at the kabupaten level through Family Planning Field&#13;
Workers (FPFW) who impart FP education to couples contacted during regular&#13;
house visits. In addition to this direct input by the NFPCB, information on&#13;
FP is also provided by private organizations such as the PKBI, whose role was&#13;
increasingly modified and limited to community education and motivation as&#13;
the GOI increased direct support for FP. FP information is also part of the&#13;
curriculum of the health education program offered in FP clinics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Public information services are rendered primarily by the Ministi&#13;
of Information and Religion, and were initiated at the instigation of the&#13;
Bureau of Information and Motivation of the Central NFPCB. The Ministry of&#13;
Information has established a FP unit which is provided with an assessment&#13;
of the information needs of the program, as well as technical information&#13;
and funds by the NFPCB. Within the Ministry of Information, FP information&#13;
teams exist at provincial and kabupaten levels. A multi-media approach is&#13;
used to cover FP subject matter which includes discussion of population&#13;
problems, the relationship between religion and FP, and information on con-&#13;
traceptive methods.&#13;
Medical services are provided by the Ministry of Health (MOH),&#13;
the armed forces, and by private agencies supervised by the MOH. Initially&#13;
these services were clinic-based, and consisted of a few hours set aside&#13;
each week during which the medical staff were available for FP services.&#13;
This arrangement was necessitated by the shortage of trained medical per-&#13;
sonnel. Recently estimated statistics for March 1979 are as follows:&#13;
Doctors                        1:13,198 population&#13;
Nurses and Midwives            1: 4,443 population&#13;
Auxiliary Health Personnel     1: 3,879 population&#13;
In spite of these limitations, by 1979, the number of clinics offering&#13;
FP services increased to nearly 3,000 in Java-Bali, and to over 5,000 in&#13;
Indonesia as a whole (National Family Planning Coordinating Board: Bureau&#13;
of Reporting and Evaluation). In an effort to service the rural areas,&#13;
most clinics were provided with field workers for door-to-door canvassing&#13;
of eligible couples, and with mobile teams staffed by paramedical personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
A major innovation by the NFPCB designed to increase contraceptive&#13;
use was to re-orient its program strategy by "transferring the primary&#13;
responsibility for motivating, recruiting and maintaining FP acceptors from&#13;
the government to the people themselves and their communities" (Nortman,&#13;
1978:23). Local community workers were enlisted to promote the small-family&#13;
norm, and serve as the delivery network for contraceptive supplies, In&#13;
addition, the field workers were reassigned to serve particular geographical&#13;
areas to ensure the availability of medical and information services. They&#13;
are no longer attached to the puskesmas (health centers), from which they&#13;
obtain logistical and other support.&#13;
In Bali, the "banjar," a hamlet bound together by kinship, social&#13;
and economic ties, became the vehicle for integrating FP into the life of&#13;
the community. Household heads meet once a month to discuss community&#13;
matters as well as the FP status of eligible women in their households. A&#13;
banjar map identifies each household according to the method of contracep-&#13;
tive use.&#13;
In Java, where village communities are more loosely bound, the&#13;
NFPCB sought to penetrate the villages by establishing village contraceptive&#13;
distribution centers (VCDC) staffed by villagers themselves (usually satis-&#13;
fied acceptors) who are assisted by field workers from the provincial NFPCB.&#13;
In the Outer Islands, the NFPCB modified its approach. Since field&#13;
workers were not employed in these provinces, the Camats 1/ from the Depart-&#13;
ment of Internal Affairs were used as a link between the national program and&#13;
the local community. Hamlet officials were trained by the Camats to assume&#13;
responsibility for the programs in their areas.&#13;
1/   The Camat is the head of a subdistrict (kecamatan).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Over the years, under the guidance of the NFPCB, the Indonesian&#13;
FP program has evolved into a unique blend of "government initiatives and&#13;
local customs" (Stokes, 1977). It has been successfully absorbed into the&#13;
political and social processes of the local institutions, thus becoming an&#13;
integral part of the community.&#13;
3.3 Program Results&#13;
Table 5 shows the extent of current use of contraceptive methods&#13;
in Indonesia. Overall, 31% of married women aged 15-44 were using some&#13;
program method of birth control in 1979/80. This figure, however, disguises&#13;
a wide variation in the current use of contraceptives by region. Estimates&#13;
of current use are given separately for provinces of Java and Bali where the&#13;
family planning program was started in 1970, Outer Islands I where it was&#13;
started in 1974, and Outer Islands II where it was started in 1979. 1/&#13;
It can be seen that, whereas 42% of married women in Java and Bali were&#13;
using birth control methods in 1979/80, only 14% of married women in the ten&#13;
provinces of Outer Islands I and 3% of those in the eleven provinces of Outer&#13;
Islands II were using contraceptives. Table 5 also shows the increase in&#13;
current use of contraceptives over time. Starting from a situation in which&#13;
a negligible proportion of married women were using contraceptives before&#13;
the program started, the proportion in Java-Bali reached 17% after half a&#13;
decade and 42% after a full decade of the program. In the provinces of&#13;
Outer Islands I it reached 14% after half a decade.&#13;
1/   The provinces of Outer Islands I are Aceh, North Sumatra, West Sumatra,&#13;
South Sumatra, Lampung, West Nusatenggara, West Kalimantan, South&#13;
Kalimantan, North Sulawesi and South Sulawesi. The provinces of Outer&#13;
Islands II are Riau , Jambi, Bengkulu, East Nusatenggara, Central&#13;
Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, Central Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi,&#13;
Mialuku, Irian Jaya and East Timor.&#13;

Table 4 highlights the extent of the decline in TFR's in the&#13;
provinces of Java-Bali between the period 1967-70 and 1976. Overall, the&#13;
TFR of Java-Bali declined from 5.3 to 4.5, a reduction of 15.1%. However,&#13;
the range of decline is wide, from a spectacular 34.5% drop in TER in Bali&#13;
to a comparatively small decline of 6.4% in Yogyakarta.&#13;
A summary of some of the changes that took place in current use of&#13;
contraceptives by currently married women of reproductive age (15-44 years)&#13;
between 1973 and 1976 is presented in Table 6. In 1976, Yogyakarta had the&#13;
highest percentage of women currently using any method of contraception (43.1)&#13;
followed by Bali (39.1), with West Java having the lowest current use (17.4).&#13;
However, as the second panel of Table 6 shows, the proportion currently using&#13;
modern methods is highest in Bali (38.3), and lowest in West Java (14.9).&#13;
This indicates a positive association between current use of modern contra-&#13;
ceptives and decline in fertility. Bali, with the highest current use of&#13;
modern methods also experienced the largest decline in its fertility (see&#13;
Table 4). On the other hand, Yogyakarta, which has a small proportion of&#13;
married women currently using modern methods (19.9 percent), experienced a&#13;
relatively small decline in its fertility.&#13;
As can be seen from Table 7, the IUD was the most common method&#13;
used in Bali by women currently using contraceptives. Yogyakarta, which had&#13;
experienced a 30.3% increase between 1973 and 1976 in the proportion of&#13;
married women currently using contraceptives, the largest increase of any&#13;
province, also showed the smallest increase, 8.8%, in the proportion currently&#13;
using a modern method. As Table 7 indicates, the traditional methods of&#13;
rhythm, withdrawal, abstinence and folk methods gained more popularity; the&#13;

proportion using these rose from 13.3% in 1973 to 54.4% in 1976. Of the&#13;
modern methods, only the use of the condom increased, while that of the pill&#13;
and of the IUD fell from 25. 5% to 8. 9% and from 52. 0% to 17. 8% respectively&#13;
over this period. In the remaining provinces, the proportion of women cur-&#13;
rently using traditional methods in 1973 was low (except Jakarta, for which no&#13;
data are available), and continued to be low in 1976. These data re-emphasize&#13;
the importance of the type of method used, rather than prevalence per se, in&#13;
contributing to the reduction in fertility.&#13;
3. 4 Evaluation&#13;
Some of the factors that contributed to the success of the FP program&#13;
have already been discussed. Primary among these is the administrative&#13;
structure that evolved under the guidance of the Central NFPCB, which&#13;
permitted both innovation and decentralization of program operations. This&#13;
decentralization permits a high degree of participation in both the planning&#13;
and implementation of the program. For the NFPCB, it serves as a device for&#13;
mobilizing the political power and enthusiasm of regional officials behind&#13;
the FP effort (Snodgrass, 1979:12).&#13;
Operational decentralization within the FP program was further&#13;
extended to the villages. Contraceptives were distributed to the villagers&#13;
either through the existing diffusion networks or through village-level&#13;
volunteers. Moreover, part of the responsibility of the administration of&#13;
the program was also shifted to the village politicians. This worked well,&#13;
especially in Bali, because of the high degree of cohesion existing in the&#13;
social and cultural structure of the villages.&#13;
In addition to the structural-functional factors, there were psycho-&#13;
logical factors that contributed to the success of the program. The most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
important of these is the strong dedication of the political leadership to&#13;
the cause of FP. In the early 1970s, a new sense of urgency was created&#13;
for slowing the population growth rate. From the President down, an aware-&#13;
ness was created that FP could not be left solely within the scope of the&#13;
Ministry of Health. Population pressure came to be viewed as a problem&#13;
affecting general community development, and Indonesians recognized that&#13;
strengthening FP meant making birth control efforts a community rather&#13;
than central government undertaking. As Haryono Suyono of the Central NFPCB&#13;
pointed out, "the long-term success of family planning in Indonesia hinges&#13;
on the ability of the government to transfer to the individual and the com-&#13;
munity the same sense of urgency that now exists at the higher levels of&#13;
government rather than simply imposing a Family Planning program on an&#13;
otherwise uncommitted public." (Stokes; 1977:32, 34-35).&#13;
To sum, the success of the FP program "rests fundamentally on&#13;
a political commitment to use an established administrative system which&#13;
is capable of reaching from the center through successively smaller admin-&#13;
istrative units to the village itself. This involves authority, power&#13;
and respect relations resting on traditional forms of relationships, but&#13;
strengthened as the fundamental framework for order and policy implementa-&#13;
tion by the present government" (Freedman, 1978:5).&#13;
*This overall FP success, which nationally appears to be an all-&#13;
encompassing movement, presents a varied pattern when viewed in terms of&#13;
provincial acceptance. In Bali, which in 1976 had the lowest estimated&#13;
fertility, the social structure creates supports for low fertility&#13;
(Hull, 1978). Therefore, there already exists a latent demand for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
contraceptives. This is reinforced by a-highly developed clinical&#13;
infrastructure for contraceptive sup'plies, and the newly introduced banjar&#13;
system.  Therefore the demographic imiracle bf'Bali has been reinforced by&#13;
certain unique featu'res of the island.&#13;
'East Java in 1976 had achieved the second lowest fertility. This&#13;
achievement'rested priniarily on the'mobilization of bureaucratic resources&#13;
by an energetic and committed leadership. However, this could emerge as a&#13;
potential weakness in that change in leadership could result in a change&#13;
in program performance (Hull, Hull and Singarimbun, 1977).&#13;
Central Java and Yogyakarta had middling success in their program&#13;
efforts.' Central Java's high reliance on the pill creates problems of motiva-&#13;
tion, guaranteed supplies and available help for side effects. Yogyakarta,&#13;
on the other hand, favored the use of highly unreliable traditional methods,&#13;
especially abstinence.&#13;
In West Java, such characteristics as high mobility, early marriage,&#13;
and high marital fertility are less conducive to fertility decline.    In&#13;
addition, a severe shortage of field workers hampered the local NFPCB approach&#13;
of pairing field workers with health p'aramedics for door-to-door service, and&#13;
this shortage was compounded by the larger average size of administrative&#13;
units in this province, implying a lower field worker to population ratio.&#13;
Jakarta documented a very low proportion of women currently using&#13;
contraceptives, and hence experienced a relatively moderate decline in fer-&#13;
tility. While such a pe'rformance is unusual for a cosmopolitan city, it may&#13;
be explained by the greater difficulty of attracting and training field&#13;
workers there and the shortage of service facilities. Family planning&#13;
services in Jakarta are thus less well developed than in most areas of Java&#13;
and Bali.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
The program has thus achieved varying success in Java-Bali, but&#13;
there is now some concern that the acceptance rates may have reached a&#13;
plateau. Recent statistics indicate that the proportion of currently married&#13;
women aged 15-44 using contraceptives continues to rise, but the absolute&#13;
number of new acceptors declined slightly for the first time in 1978/79 from&#13;
the preceding year. It is too early to conclude that acceptance rates have&#13;
levelled off and it is by no means clear that this is inevitable. Not only&#13;
has the change in fertility and contraceptive acceptance been rapid, the&#13;
flexible program design has also been able to mould itself to accommodate&#13;
varying situations. A strong base composed of administrative flexibility and&#13;
a policy of innovation already exists from which the program can respond to&#13;
changing demands that arise as the traditional brakes on fertility give way&#13;
and socio-economic development changes the nature of thb demand.&#13;
Of more importan,ce is the question of whether the experience of&#13;
Java-Bali can be transferred to the Outer Islands, which have played a crucial&#13;
role in Indonesia's population problem and hence its development efforts.&#13;
Some of the areas are currently growing by 3% or more each year and the very&#13;
young age structure of this region has a built-in momentum for population&#13;
growth that is foreboding. It is therefore crucial that the FP program&#13;
should succeed in these provinces.&#13;
The prospects of success for the program in the Outer Islands&#13;
depend on how rapidly adequate services can be provided to the people&#13;
there. Until quite recently, the clinic coverage was far from adequate.&#13;
At 8,080 women per clinic in 1976, it was still higher than the 1:7,000&#13;
ratio in densely settled Java-Bali even during the early years of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
program. However, the government is now increasing the number of puskesmas&#13;
(health centers), mobile units, and other services and this will go some&#13;
way towards overcoming the previous shortage of facilities.&#13;
Additionally, the field workers, who formed the cornerstone of&#13;
the program in Java-Bali by acting as recruiters and motivators, were not&#13;
included in the Outer Islands program in order to hold down costs. Community&#13;
leaders and village officials therefore assume the tasks of both recruiting&#13;
and distributing in the Outer Islands. This strategy is kept under con-&#13;
stant review to ensure adequate program results, particularly as it places&#13;
the main burden on busy government officials who have other duties to per-&#13;
form as well.&#13;
The main challenge in reducing fertility in the Outer Islands&#13;
will be the organization and logistics of providing services to the more&#13;
scattered population in many areas. Because of the relatively small size of&#13;
population in the Outer Islands, it has been possible to reduce the average&#13;
number of married women served by a clinic considerably. In 1979/80, a clinic&#13;
in Java and Bali served 4,538 women on average, compared with 3,907 in Outer&#13;
Islands I and 2,895 in Outer Islands II. However, the logistical problem&#13;
facing the program in the Outer Islands is highlighted by data on the average&#13;
area served by a clinic. In 1979/80, a clinic in Java and Bali covered 46&#13;
square kilometers on average. In contrast, a clinic served 428 square kilo-&#13;
meters in Outer Islands I and 1,668 square kilometers in Outer Islands II.&#13;
Thus the problem is not so much one of providing enough clinics for the given&#13;
number of eligible women as ensuring that clinics are within a reasonable&#13;
distance from the potential users. The problem is crucial for the success of&#13;
the family planning program in the Outer Islands where the pill and the condom&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
are more popular than in Java and Bali so that the resupply of contraceptives&#13;
is a more important part of the program. In 1979/80, 67.4% of current users&#13;
in Outer Islands I and 76.0% of those in Outer Islands II were using the pill,&#13;
compared with 62.8% in Java and Bali; 7.5% in Outer Islands I and 7.3% in&#13;
Outer Islands II were using the condom, compared with 6.1% in Java and Bali.&#13;
In contrast, 18.7% in Outer Islands I and 11.3% in Outer Islands II were using&#13;
the IUD, whereas 28.1% in Java and Bali were. There is, however, no evidence&#13;
that the program will face religious or socio-cultural obstacles in the Outer&#13;
Islands substantially different from those in Java-Bali. But desired family&#13;
size is at the present appreciably greater in the Outer Islands, and it seems&#13;
clear that the focus of the struggle to hold down the size of the population&#13;
of Indonesia requires increasing emphasis on extending the program in the&#13;
Outer Islands.&#13;
In conclusion, certain aspects of the Indonesian experience have&#13;
been crucial for its success. These are a program design sufficiently&#13;
flexible to accommodate the existing socio-political and socio-cultural&#13;
institutions and a readiness to innovate.&#13;
4.   Determinants of Family Planning Practice and Fertility Behavior&#13;
4.1 The Data and the Setting&#13;
This study uses data at the household level from the second round&#13;
of the 1976 Intercensal Population Survey for Indonesia (SUPAS II). The&#13;
sample design for the survey and summaries of various statistics have been&#13;
well documented (Biro Pusat Statistik, 1976, 1978). The data pertain to&#13;
some 60,000 households, with a provincial breakdown given in Table A3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
These households were interviewed during February - March 1976. Rural areas&#13;
of Maluku, Irian Jaya and East Nusatenggara were excluded from the survey&#13;
altogether.&#13;
Some basic information has been obtained from unpublished tabula-&#13;
tions provided by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) which gives a simple&#13;
overview of the provinces or islands according to their demographic and&#13;
socio-economic characteristics. The detailed tabulations have been summa-&#13;
rized in Table A4 and are given by province for Java and by major island&#13;
for the Outer Islands. Urban and rural areas are treated separately.&#13;
To summarize the tabulations, to which the interested reader is&#13;
referred for greater details on variations across provinces or islands and&#13;
urban/rural areas of residence, the differences in demographic and socio-&#13;
economic characteristics between Java and the Outer Islands are quite strik-&#13;
ing. The Outer Islands have a higher propbrtion of young children under five&#13;
than Java, 16.1% compared with 14.5%, and a higher average number of children&#13;
ever born per ever-married woman, 4.2 compared with 3.6. These findings are&#13;
consistent with the higher population growth rate and total fertility rate&#13;
for the Outer Islands already reported.&#13;
Yet at first sight there are reasons for expecting a higher birth&#13;
rate in Java than in the Outer Islands: the proportion of women aged 15 to&#13;
49, that is, of child-bearing age, in the total female population is higher&#13;
in Java, 49% compared with 47%, as is the proportion of ever-married women in&#13;
the total female population, 72% compared with 64%; the average age at first&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
marriage is lower in Java, 16.8 years compared with 18.3 in the Outer Islands,&#13;
and the average age of ever-married women is correspondingly lower in Java,&#13;
38.2 compared with 44.0. On the other hand, there are factors working the&#13;
other way: childlessness is more' prevalent in Java, 13.4% compared with 8.9%;&#13;
and marital disruption is more frequent in Java, as indicated by 35.1% of&#13;
ever-married women having married more than once, compared with 17.3% in the&#13;
Outer Islands.&#13;
A large proportion of ever-married Javanese women are without any&#13;
schooling. However, they are also more likely to be working or looking for&#13;
work than their counterparts in the Outer Islands. A higher proportion of&#13;
them have heard of a method of family planning, 76.5% compared with 51.2%&#13;
in the Outer Islands, where there are also great variations among the dif-&#13;
ferent islands. Whereas 65% of those in Sulawesi have heard of a method,&#13;
only 28% of those in Kalimantan have. The proportion currently using a&#13;
method of family planning is low compared with the proportion who have heard&#13;
of a method in both regions, but is still much higher in Java at 23.9% than&#13;
in the Outer Islands at 6.4%. The average number of surviving children is&#13;
lower in Java, as is the proportion of married women wanting an additional&#13;
child.&#13;
In terms of the characteristics described above, Bali resembles&#13;
Java rather than the Outer Islands, especially in the area of family planning.&#13;
In summary, Java and the Outer Islands are very different in terms&#13;
of their demographic and socio-economic characteristics. While Java has&#13;
some demographic aspects consistent with a higher birth rate than the Outer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
Islands, there are some mitigating factors, most notably the greater pre-&#13;
valence of knowledge and use of family planning, as well as a lower desire&#13;
for additional children despite an already lower number of surviving children.&#13;
Bali is altogether a special case in the Outer Islands.&#13;
4.2 Analytical Framework and Statistical Procedure&#13;
As pointed out earlier, it is not possible to establish that any&#13;
single socioeconomic improvement, such as the spread of education or improve-&#13;
ments in health, or any single policy, such as family planning, is a pre-&#13;
requisite to fertility decline. Rather, it is clear that each makes its&#13;
contribution; to see this requires an understanding of the decision making&#13;
of individuals concerning fertility.&#13;
Economists and other social scientists have developed a simple&#13;
model of family fertility behavior, which explains why it is sensible for&#13;
the poor to have large families, and which provides a guide to how changes&#13;
in the family's economic and social environment will affect fertility. 1/&#13;
In the first place, children may be considered a consumption good;&#13;
they are a source of pleasure to parents. In many developing countries,&#13;
children are also a form of investment, both short-term if they work during&#13;
childhood and long-term if they support parents in old age. But parents&#13;
need to spend time as well as money to bring up children. Therefore if family&#13;
income increases, parents may be expected to want more children. This then&#13;
would provide an explanation if we find that better-off families have more&#13;
children.&#13;
1/   The analytical framework is taken from Birdsall, Nancy, Population and&#13;
Poverty in the Developing World, World Bank, mimeo., February 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
But in reality we usually observe a negative association between&#13;
family income and family size. Several non-competing reasons have been&#13;
offered for this phenomenon. First, with increasing educational and employ-&#13;
ment opportunities for women, they want smaller families. Women are primarily&#13;
responsible for childrearing and, as their horizons expand beyond the family,&#13;
the alternative uses of time, either to earn incomes or enjoy other purchased&#13;
goods, become more attractive. This explanation is consistent with the&#13;
frequent observation that more educated women have lower fertility. Second,&#13;
there is an explanation which reinforces the previous one. In low-wage&#13;
settings, much of women's traditional work, in agriculture, traditional&#13;
crafts and petty trading, are compatible with childcare, so that looking&#13;
after children does not involve loss of income. As women accept job oppor-&#13;
tunities outside the home, they find that these compete with having children&#13;
and so may want fewer of them. Third, the children of the poor help around&#13;
the house and work outside the home at an early age. In addition, if they do&#13;
not go to school, so that the costs of schooling can be avoided, then having&#13;
many children means a larger contribution to family income. The children's&#13;
contribution to family income is less important for better-off families who&#13;
can also better afford the costs of schooling. Fourth, if children contribute&#13;
to parents' support in old age, the low current costs of raising children&#13;
are a small premium to pay for insurance against future uncertainties. Where&#13;
mothers command only low wages, the difference between children's and mothers'&#13;
earnings may be small; work time lost by the mother during a child's infancy&#13;
may be easily recaptured by the child in later years. Better-off parents view&#13;
children as a less important source of support in old age and therefore have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
less incentive for large families. Fifth, with increasing income, parents opt&#13;
for healthier and better-educated children, but fewer of them. Parents are&#13;
more likely to seek increased education for their children when they believe&#13;
that their children's future work opportunities will be governed less by class&#13;
origin or family background than by education and associated skills, and this&#13;
tends to be a consequence of development.&#13;
The link between low household income and high fertility is rein-&#13;
forced by two further forces. The first is the set of reasons why high rates&#13;
of infant mortality are commonly found together with high fertility in low-&#13;
income families. In the first place, mothers who cease breast-feeding because&#13;
of the death of an infant are biologically more likely to conceive another.&#13;
Moreover, parents who lose children are likely to try to replace them; in&#13;
addition, parents in high mortality communities may also insure themselves&#13;
against future child loss by having more children than they would ideally&#13;
want. On the other hand, high fertility contributes to high infant and child&#13;
mortality because close spacing of births and many births may deplete the&#13;
mother's physical resources and reduce the amount a family has to spend on&#13;
each member of it; a commonly noted phenomenon is the death of a child when,&#13;
on the birth of a subsequent child, the mother ceases breastfeeding the older&#13;
child.&#13;
The second is the fact that poor households are often in situations&#13;
where modern and simple means to restrict fertility are not easily avail-&#13;
able, or if available are costly. For a poor family in a rural area, where&#13;
means of family limitation are confined to abstinence, illegal abortion and&#13;
infanticide, or to ineffective and difficult traditional contraception, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
psychological or financial costs of avoiding a particular pregnancy may&#13;
exceed the costs of having an additional child. Even in urban areas, the&#13;
costs of obtaining contraception through private doctors may outweigh the&#13;
additional cost of another child to a poor household. tioreover, in most&#13;
societies, though both parents enjoy the satisfaction children bring, it is&#13;
the mother who bears more of the physical and usually more of the caretaking&#13;
costs of chidren. In some cultures, the mother may even bear primary finan-&#13;
cial responsibility for children; this is the case where marital disruption&#13;
is frequent or where unions are highly informal. Yet, if contraceptives are&#13;
difficult to obtain and costly, women cannot restrict their fertility without&#13;
complete cooperation from husbands or other sexual partners. Finally, family&#13;
planning availability may lower the social, as well as private, costs of&#13;
avoiding children, by legitimizing what relatives, friends, the community,&#13;
the clan or village might otherwise have frowned upon as unusual behavior.&#13;
This could help explain the growing acceptance of modern family planning in&#13;
Indonesia, where the government has encouraged community-level cooperation&#13;
in arranging and administering services.&#13;
A decline in the birth rate may reflect a decline in marital fer-&#13;
tility, that is, the childbearing behavior of couples, an increase in the&#13;
average age at which women marry in a society, or a reduction in the propor-&#13;
tion of women who ever marry.&#13;
An increase in the female age at marriage affects the birth rates&#13;
in two ways not linked to individual behavior: it shortens the period during&#13;
which women are exposed to pregnancy, and at an age when fecundity is high;&#13;
and it lengthens the interval between generations. In addition, there may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
be behavioral effects of late marriage. In part, women who marry later have&#13;
fewer children because the same factors which lead to later marriage, such&#13;
as greater education and employment opportunities, also directly reduce&#13;
fertility; but it is also possible that later marriage assures individual&#13;
women more time to explore interests beyond family and childbearing, interests&#13;
which they take with them into married life and which moderate their fertility&#13;
goals.&#13;
In the statistical analysis which follows, we shall attempt to&#13;
determine the direction and extent of association between family planning&#13;
practice, as well as fertility, and a number of factors suggested by the model&#13;
outlined above. The sample used includes all ever-married women. 1/ Family&#13;
planning practice is represented by knowledge and use of contraception.&#13;
Fertility will be measured by the number of children ever born to an ever-&#13;
married woman. The explanatory factors for fertility may be grouped as&#13;
follows: exposure to pregnancy (age, age at first marriage, marital disruption);&#13;
education; economic activity (labor force participation, place of work);&#13;
economic status (ownership of modern consumer durables, 2/ level of household&#13;
consumption expenditures); knowledge of contraception; and cultural and&#13;
environmental factors (religion, urban/ rural area of residence). 3/&#13;
The first set of factors indicating exposure to pregnancy controls&#13;
for the simple fact that the greater the exposure, the larger the potential&#13;
1/   No attempt was made at this stage to select just one woman per household.&#13;
It is estimated that roughly 10% of the women in the sample belong to&#13;
households with more than one woman included in the study. This reduces&#13;
somewhat the variance in the common household variables, but is not&#13;
believed to affect the results obtained.&#13;
2/   These include the following:   radio, television, stereo, refrigerator,&#13;
motorcycle and automobile.&#13;
3/   There is multicollinearity between some of these variables, especially&#13;
those indicating economic status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
number of children ever born. The factors describing the education status&#13;
of the woman and economic status of the household taken as a group should,&#13;
as they improve, be associated with fewer children. However, in the range&#13;
where education and income have improved only slightly, it is possible&#13;
that the factors which the model postulates will lead to a lower demand for&#13;
children, such as increasing employment opportunities for women outside the&#13;
home and the desire of parents to give children a better education, may not&#13;
yet operate. In such a case, it is possible to find the somewhat higher&#13;
education and income status being associated with a larger number of children.&#13;
In addition, it has been suggested that at low levels of income, fertility is&#13;
likely to increase with an improvement in socio-economic conditions through&#13;
improved maternal health and fecundity (Easterlin 1976). The set of factors&#13;
concerned with economic activity is again suggested by the model; work outside&#13;
the home is expected to be associated with a lower demand for children.&#13;
Finally, religion and urban/rural area of residence are expected to influence&#13;
fertility through the norms set by society for family size.&#13;
For this initial exploratory effort, a single-equation multivariate&#13;
regression or logit analysis has been used. 1/ This procedure ignores the&#13;
more complex interdependent structure underlying fertility behavior that would&#13;
consider age at first marriage, female labor-force participation and children's&#13;
schooling as being codetermined with the number of children the couple is&#13;
likely to have. The analysis is carried out separately for Java, Bali and the&#13;
Outer Islands.&#13;
1/   Logit analysis is used when the dependent variable is dichotomous,&#13;
namely for the equations explaining whether a woman knows of, has ever&#13;
used, and is using a program method of, contraception.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
The explanatory factors for knowledge and use of contraception&#13;
include the ones for fertility listed above, with the obvious exception&#13;
of knowledge of contraception itself. In addition, the number of children&#13;
who have died and the number of children who have survived are included.&#13;
In an attempt to test the effect of the availability of contraceptives on&#13;
knowledge and use of contraception, while allowing for the effects of socio-&#13;
economic factors, two other factors are added, namely, the number of family&#13;
planning clinics per eligible couple and the number of clinics per square'&#13;
kilometer in the province of residence of the woman. The first of these&#13;
indicates availability of family planning service relative to the potential&#13;
number of users of the service, while the second reflects the convenience&#13;
in getting to it. If the population is scattered over a wide area, then&#13;
the average distance for getting to a clinic would be greater than for a&#13;
smaller area with the same number of clinics per eligible couple. The family&#13;
planning program data used in the regression equations are at the provincial&#13;
level so that the results will only reflect provincial variations in family'&#13;
planning service. Data at a more detailed level, for example the kabupaten&#13;
or village, would have been more appropriate.&#13;
4.3 Statistical Estimates&#13;
4.3.1 Family Planning&#13;
This part of the analysis is concerned with knowledge and practice&#13;
of family planning, and utilizes three questions asked of all ever-married&#13;
women in SUPAS II: whether they have heard of any methods of family planning&#13;
(FP); if they have heard, whether they have ever used any method; and, if&#13;
they are currently using a method, whether they are using a program method,&#13;
namely the pill, IUD or condom. On the basis of the responses to these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
questions, an attempt will be made to assess the impact of the FP program on&#13;
fertility behavior and to identify those women who may be receptive to the&#13;
program.&#13;
Table 8 gives the proportions of women giving affirmative answers&#13;
to the three questions listed above by region. It can be seen that there are&#13;
impressive differences between Java-Bali and the Outer Islands. Whereas&#13;
roughly two-thirds of all women aged 15 to 49 in Java-Bali have heard of a&#13;
method of family planning, in the Outer Islands this is true for 58% of&#13;
those in Sulawesi, just over 50% of those in Sumatra and Nusatenggara and only&#13;
30% of those in Kalimantan. The differences are even more striking for use&#13;
of family planning. Of those women who have ever heard of a method, the&#13;
proportion who have ever used one is 40% in Java and 55% in Bali, while in the&#13;
Outer Islands the proportion is never greater than 20% and is as low as 12% in&#13;
Sulawesi and 13% in Sumatra. Of those currently using a method, the proportion&#13;
using a program method is substantially higher in Java-Bali, being as high as&#13;
87% in Java and 95% in Bali. In the Outer Islands, the proportion using a&#13;
program method, of those currently using any method, ranges from 70% in&#13;
Sulawesi to 40% in Nusatenggara. Thus among users there has been as yet&#13;
little substitution of program methods for traditional ones in many areas.&#13;
These differences are consistent with the fact that the FP program has been&#13;
active in Java-Bali since 1970 but has only been introduced to the Outer&#13;
Islands since 1974. Nevertheless, without an analysis which properly takes&#13;
into account the vast socio-economic differences across regions, it would be&#13;
premature to credit the FP program with the entire decline in fertility in&#13;
Java and Bali.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
The results of the multivariate logit analysis aimed at identifying&#13;
the socio-economic factors which can be associated with knowledge and use of&#13;
contraception are given in Tables A5, A6 and A7. 1/ A summary of the findings&#13;
is given here.&#13;
When all other factors, including the number of living children,&#13;
are controlled for, it is found that knowledge, general practice and use&#13;
of modern contraception decline with the age of the woman. 2/ In general,&#13;
late marriers appear to be more knowledgeable about contraception and this&#13;
knowledge translates into actual use in all three regions considered. In&#13;
addition, later marriage is associated with greater use of program methods.&#13;
The evidence thus suggests that women who marry later are more inclined to&#13;
acquire knowledge of contraception and, moreover, that the FP program in&#13;
Java-Bali may have promoted the use of contraception in general and of pro-&#13;
gram methods in particular. Later marriage thus contributes to smaller family&#13;
size both by limiting the woman's exposure to pregnancy and through greater&#13;
knowledge and use of contraception.&#13;
Being currently married significantly increases the likelihood that&#13;
a woman knows of family planning, and actual use is also higher among currently&#13;
married women. Since extramarital child bearing is rare in Indonesia, these&#13;
findings are consistent with the notion that subfecundity may be a reason for&#13;
divorce or separation.&#13;
1/   Because of the large sample size and computing limitations, the logit&#13;
equations are based on a random sample of the observations.&#13;
2/   The sample used in the equations involving general practice and use of&#13;
modern contraception is a random sample of all women, not just women&#13;
who know of contraception or who have ever used it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
One of the most important findings is that the number of living&#13;
children appears to be the most significant factor in influencing both&#13;
the knowledge and use of contraception. The results are statistically sig-&#13;
nificant in all the regions considered. It also increases the likelihood that&#13;
a woman uses a program method. Moreover, it is the number of living children&#13;
that matters, not the number of children ever born. This finding gives the&#13;
strongest support yet to the hypothesis that family planning is a function of&#13;
family size and comes into play only after a woman has achieved her desired&#13;
family size.&#13;
Throughout Indonesia better-educated women are more likely to&#13;
have some knowledge of contraception. Moreover, better education is also&#13;
associated with actual use of contraception except in Bali. One striking&#13;
finding is that the use of modern program contraceptives is in general not&#13;
associated with socio-economic status as represented by ownership of modern&#13;
durables in Java and Bali or with the level of education in Bali. This&#13;
interesting finding suggests that in Java-Bali the program has been made&#13;
accessible to the lower socio-economic groups; either the program has reached&#13;
out to them or they have sought the services of the program. The lower&#13;
socio-economic groups are also more likely to respond to community pressure,&#13;
of which the family planning program has taken advantage.&#13;
In the Outer Islands, women who work outside the home are more&#13;
likely to know about family planning but are not necessarily more likely to&#13;
have ever used contraception.&#13;
The results of including family planning statistics in the regres-&#13;
sion equations for knowledge and use of contraception are interesting.&#13;
Our prior expectations are that both the number of clinics per eligible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
couple and the number of clinics per square kilometer would be positively&#13;
related to knowledge and use of contraception. We find that the number of&#13;
clinics per eligible couple is negatively associated with knowledge of contra-&#13;
ception in Java. However, a greater number of clinics per square kilometer&#13;
is positively associated with knowledge of contraception in the Outer Islands,&#13;
while the association is negative in Java. 1/ The results are not surprising&#13;
since in the Outer Islands the population is scattered over a very large area&#13;
and hence greater density of clinics can be expected to increase knowledge,&#13;
while in Java the density of clinics is relatively high all over the island&#13;
but the urban areas like Jakarta and Yogyakarta which have more clinics per&#13;
eligible couple and per square kilometer also have lower proportions of women&#13;
who know of contraception.&#13;
On the other hand, the probability that a woman has ever used&#13;
contraception is positively related to the number of clinics per eligible&#13;
couple in Java, after taking into account other socio-economic factors.    For&#13;
the Outer Islands, the number of clinics per square kilometer has a positive&#13;
effect on use of contraception, while the number of clinics per eligible&#13;
couple has a negative effect.&#13;
Finally, a larger probability of a women using a program method is&#13;
associated with more clinics per square kilometer in the Outer Islands but&#13;
with more clinics per eligible couple in Java.&#13;
In general, greater knowledge and use of contraception are asso-&#13;
ciated with urban residence in the Outer Islands but, in contrast, with rural&#13;
residence in Java-Bali. The same phenomenon is captured in the negative&#13;
effect of availability of clinics on knowledge of contraception in Java.&#13;
1/   Since the FP program statistics are at the provincial level, they are&#13;
not included in the equation for Bali only.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
In conclusion, the multivariate analysis of family planning practice&#13;
has yielded three important conclusions. First, the number of living children&#13;
a woman has is the most significant factor influencing knowledge and use of&#13;
contraception, which suggests that women seek information on family planning&#13;
when they have achieved their desired family size. Second, in Java-Bali,&#13;
the family planning program, which has been in operation for some years, has&#13;
reached the lower socio-economic groups who show greater acceptance of program&#13;
methods than the higher groups, among those who are using some method of&#13;
family planning. Third, the availability of clinics is positively associated&#13;
with greater knowledge and use of contraception in the Outer Islands.&#13;
4.3.2 Fertility&#13;
The regression estimates with the number of children ever born to&#13;
ever-married women as the dependent variable for Java, Bali and the Outer&#13;
Islands are presented in Table A8. In order to make the results comparable&#13;
across different regions, each having a different mean and a different coeffi-&#13;
cient for every variable, elasticities around region-specific means were&#13;
calculated for the continuous variables. 1/ These are presented in Table A9.&#13;
For the dummy variables, a measure comparable to the elasticity has been used;&#13;
this gives the change in the number of children ever born attributable to the&#13;
dummy variable as a percentage of the predicted level around the mean without&#13;
this variable. The results are given in Table AIO.&#13;
The regression equations should be interpreted in the context of&#13;
the analytical framework set out in section three. First of all, we have&#13;
three variables which together reflect the exposure of a woman to pregnancy:&#13;
1/   These are summary statistics giving the percentage change in the average&#13;
number of children ever born associated with a one percentage change in&#13;
the independent variable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
her current age, age at first marriage and marital disruption. The results&#13;
are as expected and statistically significant throughout. The number of&#13;
children ever born is positively associated with increasing age of the woman,&#13;
and negatively associated both with increasing age at first marriage and with&#13;
marital disruption following death of the husband, divorce or separation.&#13;
Since the effects of other socio-economic factors are controlled&#13;
for, the coefficients of current age in the regressions reflect the underlying&#13;
propensity to have children of ever-married women. It is interesting that&#13;
this propensity is higher in the Outer Islands than in Java and Bali. The&#13;
finding may reflect higher preferences for children in the Outer Islands&#13;
which are not correlated with the factors included here, and also the lower&#13;
prevalence of family planning practice there.&#13;
The correlation coefficients underlying the regression coefficients&#13;
reported here indicate that late marriage is associated with a higher level&#13;
of education and income. Therefore socio-economic factors have both a direct&#13;
effect on fertility and an indirect effect through their influence on the age&#13;
at first marriage. The finding that age at first marriage has a substantial&#13;
effect on the number of children ever born,.as shown in Table All, is indica-&#13;
tive of a situation in which family planning is still not widely practiced.&#13;
The lower current average ages at first marriage in Java compared with the&#13;
Outer Islands is reflected in the greater potential effect of this variable on&#13;
fertility decline in Java.&#13;
With respect to marital disruption it should be noted that child-&#13;
lessness may be a reason for divorce or separation, so that the association&#13;
between this variable and fertility can go either way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
The analytical framework for fertility behavior led us to expect&#13;
a negative association between fertility and both education and income level,&#13;
although at low levels of education and income the association may be posi-&#13;
tive. The results are generally consistent with this expectation. In the&#13;
Outer Islands, more education is first associated with higher fertility,&#13;
but beyond completion of elementary school, it is associated with lower&#13;
fertility. In Java and Bali the relationship between education and fertility&#13;
is generally negative.&#13;
For the income-related variables, fertility is positively associated&#13;
with household expenditures but negatively associated with its squared value,&#13;
showing that fertility initially rises with increasing expenditures but&#13;
declines beyond a certain level. Ownership of modern consumer durables,&#13;
which reflects a household income above some minimal level, as well as moderni-&#13;
sation, shows a negative association with fertility. It would thus appear that,&#13;
at low levels of income and education of women, an improvement in these var-&#13;
iables may be associated with rising fertility but, beyond some level of educa-&#13;
tion and income, the improvement is clearly associated with falling fertility. 1/&#13;
As far as economic activity is concerned, women who are not economi-&#13;
cally active have fewer children. This may be taken as indicative of the&#13;
negative effect of maternal ill health on fertility. Although we had expected&#13;
to find women engaged in housekeeping having more children, as well as women&#13;
1/   Similar results have been obtained by other researchers.    See, for&#13;
example, Valerie J. Hull, The Positive Relation between Economic Class&#13;
and Family Size in Java, Gadjah Mada University, Population Institute,&#13;
Monograph Series No. 2, 1976.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
who work in household enterprises as compared to outside the home, the results&#13;
obtained here are mixed, with the expected results being obtained for Java&#13;
but not Bali or the Outer Islands.&#13;
The religion variables are included in the Outer Islands equation to&#13;
control for differences in the attitudes towards the number of children&#13;
desired by a family, as well as towards family planning. These variables are&#13;
not suitable for showing differences among religions when used in the Java or&#13;
Bali equations where there is a strong association between religion and&#13;
island; for example, Bali is mostly Hindu while Java is predominantly Muslim.&#13;
The religion variables therefore show too little variation and have not been&#13;
included in the regressions for Java and Bali.&#13;
Knowledge of contraception was included in the equation without&#13;
any a priori notion. This approach was adopted because, on the one hand,&#13;
women with knowledge of contraception have the means for limiting family size.&#13;
On the other hand, women who wish to limit fertility may be more vigorous in&#13;
their search for knowledge on contraception. The regression results tend to&#13;
confirm the second hypothesis since we find a positive association between&#13;
knowledge of contraception and the number of children ever born. Thus women&#13;
with more children are the ones with greater awareness of contraception.&#13;
To conclude, after controlling for exposure to pregnancy which&#13;
is naturally positively associated with fertility, the regressions show&#13;
that the underlying propensity of women to have children, holding other&#13;
factors constant, appears to be higher in the Outer Islands than in Java-&#13;
Bali, reflecting some systematic factors which have been excluded from the&#13;
regressions, for example, the fact that the FP program was introduced more&#13;
recently in the Outer Islands or that land is less scarce in relation to the&#13;
size of population there.&#13;

At low levels of education and income, there is a positive associa-&#13;
tion between these factors and fertility. However, the association is clearly&#13;
negative at higher levels. Thus higher levels of schooling and an improvement&#13;
in the standard of living will eventually be associated with a decline in&#13;
fertility. Modernisation, which is here approximated by ownership of modern&#13;
durables, is found to be negatively associated with fertility. It is found&#13;
that women with larger numbers of children are the ones who seek knowledge&#13;
of contraception.&#13;
4.4 Conclusion&#13;
These preliminary results represent a first attempt aimed at assess-&#13;
ing the relative influence of both socio-economic factors and the family&#13;
planning program on fertility behavior in Indonesia. In addition, the study&#13;
is unique in that it is the only one of this kind which focuses on differences&#13;
between Java-Bali and the Outer Islands.   The results show that there are&#13;
some fundamental differences in fertility behavior and family planning&#13;
practice in Java-Bali and the Outer Islands. The former can apparently be&#13;
characterized by a lower propensity of women to have children, given that&#13;
other factors are controlled for, and by a much greater prevalence of family&#13;
planning knowledge and practice, among the lower socio-economic groups as well&#13;
as the higher ones. Thus, whereas it is clear that socio-economic factors do&#13;
influence fertility and family planning decisions, their significance may be&#13;
reduced when all strata of society have easy access to contraception. Where&#13;
family planning has only recently been introduced, such as the Outer Islands,&#13;
availability of family planning service is positively associated with knowledge&#13;
and use of contraception.&#13;

            Regional aspects of family planning and
            fertility behavior in Indonesia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper discusses the recent decline
            in the population growth rate of Indonesia whch has been
            achieved at a relatively low level of income and
            socio-economic development. Evidence is presented of this
            decline which is largely attributed to the fall in the total
            fertility rate in Java-Bali. The much higher growth rate of
            population in the Outer Islands remains a matter of concern
            and the paper accordingly focuses on differences between
            Java-Bali and the Outer Islands. The paper briefly reviews
            the history and organization of the family planning program
            in Indonesia, attempts to identify those factors which have
            been responsible for its success and to assess its prospects
            for the future. It then presents the results of a
            multivariate analysis, using data from the 1976 Intercensal
            Population Survey, which attempts to explain fertility
            behavior and family planning practice by socio-economic
            factors as well as the availability of family planning services.
