STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA&#13;
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
I. Country and Sector Background&#13;
A. Current Agricultural Situation&#13;
1.           The First Republic (1958-1984) imposed heavy taxation on agriculture and provided little&#13;
support for technology development and dissemination and rural infrastructure. Consequently, the&#13;
performance of the agricultural sector was poor and the agricultural trade balance became negative. With&#13;
the change in regime and economic liberalization, agriculture has grown since the late 1980s at a rate of&#13;
over 3.0 percent p.a., reaching a peak of 5.1 percent in 1994. Agriculture has great potential for increased&#13;
production through yield increases, given Guinea's favorable climatic and agro-ecological conditions, and&#13;
the currently low levels of technology.&#13;
B. Main Sectoral Issues and Sector Strategy&#13;
2.            Guinea's agriculture is characterized by small holdings (70 percent of farms have less than&#13;
2 ha), and very low labor and land productivity due to limited use of improved agricultural technology,&#13;
genetic material, animal traction, and commercial inputs. Consumption of fertilizers is only about 8,000&#13;
tons per year, and pesticide consumption is negligible. Average yields (kg/ha) for the major crops are as&#13;
follows: paddy -- 600-1,500; fonio -- 500; corn/millet and sorghum intercropped -- 900; groundnuts -- 600;&#13;
and cassava 7,000. These yields are low due to declining natural soil fertility, low input use, poor seed&#13;
quality, and poor husbandry practices. Except for the last few years, yields were stagnant and production&#13;
increases were mostly the result of area expansion. Over the years, the agricultural trade balance has&#13;
deteriorated: rice imports have increased and agricultural exports have stagnated. Prior to 1984, total rice&#13;
imports remained below 80,000 tons; in 1985 they reached 110,000 tons; and by 1994, 270,000 tons. In&#13;
1994, these rice imports amounted to about US$50.0 million or five times the value of major agricultural&#13;
exports.&#13;
3.           In addition, the public expenditure review carried out by IDA and the Government in early&#13;
1995 raises the following key issues concerning agricultural investments and the role of the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, Livestock and Forests (MAEF): (a) public sector involvement in agriculture is large and&#13;
disproportionate to what is needed to provide an enabling environment for agricultural growth. The&#13;
functions, structure and size of the MAEF (currently about 9,000 employees) need to be reexamined. This&#13;
is all the more important as producer organizations, village associations and small enterprises are&#13;
increasingly able to carry out some of the activities previously provided by Government departments; (b)&#13;
the current pattern of funding of recurrent and investment expenditures in agriculture is untenable.&#13;
Personnel expenditures take up almost all (97 percent) of MAEF's recurrent budget, and donors are&#13;
financing 85 percent of investment expenditures as well as 80 percent of recurrent expenditures. This&#13;
situation has led to a donor-driven and fragmented investment program; (c) insufficient attention is paid to&#13;
operation and maintenance expenditures, especially for rural infrastructure.  Credible strategies for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
maintenance and cost recovery need to be developed; and (d) the cost of public investment in agriculture is&#13;
high (including substantial expenditures for technical assistance) and its impact is limnited. Criteria need to&#13;
be established for judging the acceptability and priority of investment projects. MAEF also needs to ensure&#13;
that extemally financed projects fit into the core investment program, that their numbers remain within&#13;
manageable limits and that their development impact is commensurate with the expenditure made.&#13;
Expansion of cultivated area, low and stagnant crop yields, and rising per capita food imports are all&#13;
indications that the efficiency of agricultural investment urgently needs to be enhanced. As implementation&#13;
capacity in MAEF expands, and in order to accelerate this process, all projects remaining in the public&#13;
sector domain should be integrated into national programs under the line departments; the creation of&#13;
parallel project implementation units should be avoided. All of this will require a new partnership between&#13;
MAEF and intemational donors. In this context, the role of long-term technical assistance needs to be&#13;
reviewed with a view to reducing it over time and replacing it with short-term consultancies whenever&#13;
outside expertise is needed.&#13;
4.            The Government is aware of these issues and has started to rationalize public sector&#13;
investments in agriculture, and to coordinate the interventions of different donors more closely. Two&#13;
specific measures have been taken in this context: (a) development of this operation, i.e., the National&#13;
Agricultural Services Project (NASP) as a tool to rationalize public expenditures; and (b) formulation of&#13;
an agricultural sector policy note (Annex 5). The NASP harmonizes donor interventions in key areas of&#13;
agricultural development, and its design addresses in a practical manner the concerns raised in the public&#13;
expenditure review. The agricultural policy note, which is an integral part of this operation, states the&#13;
Govenmment's position in key areas: (a) respective roles of the public and private sectors in agricultural&#13;
development; (b) improvements in the quality of individual investment projects and in the agricultural&#13;
public investment program as a whole; (c) cost recovery and recurrent cost financing; (d) technical&#13;
assistance; (e) input supply systems; and (f) the procedure that will be followed with all the donors to&#13;
update the Agricultural Development Policy Letter. In the agricultural policy note, MAEF states clearly&#13;
that its primary role is to encourage private sector initiative and investments by creating the enabling&#13;
environment, and by limiting itself to the provision of services and infrastructure that have a public goods&#13;
nature. MAEF is determined to transform a public sector administration that was bloated under the First&#13;
Republic into a lean, technically competent development administration. To this effect, MAEF has carried&#13;
out an institutional analysis of all its units and their staff and is in the process of readjusting the staffing of&#13;
the Ministry in accordance with a more narrowly defined mandate. The proposed project will help&#13;
accelerate this process and promote a viable solution to the problem of overstaffing within the Ministry&#13;
through voluntary staff reductions (see para. 14).&#13;
5.            The Govemment's overall goals and strategy for the agricultural sector are articulated in&#13;
its 1991 Letter of Agricultural Development Policy (LPDA), which was submitted to IDA as part of the&#13;
National Agricultural Export Promotion Project (Cr. 2407-GUI). The overall goals are to: (i) promote&#13;
food security and reduce food imports (especially of rice); (ii) promote agricultural exports (coffee, fruits,&#13;
and cotton); (iii) provide essential support services to rural producers, and (iv) ensure a rational&#13;
management of natural resources. The Govemment strategy to achieve these objectives is to: (a) pursue&#13;
the macro-economic reforms agreed under the SAL and sector adjustment programs to reinforce the market&#13;
economy; (b) continue to disengage the State from productive activities and from services that can be&#13;
privatized; (c) improve business conditions to attract private agricultural investments, (d) improve&#13;
agricultural research and extension, and develop a seed industry; (e) improve rural infrastructure, and (f)&#13;
build up local administrative capacity. The agricultural policy letter will be fomally revised by December&#13;
31, 1996, by which time the Government, after consultation with IDA and other donors, will organize a&#13;
donors' meeting to review investment needs not covered by this project. Main areas for investment are&#13;
rural infrastructure (rural roads, village water supply, and small-scale irrigation), and credit. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
agricultural sector policy note referred to in para. 4 will form the basis for the revised agricultural policy&#13;
letter.&#13;
II. The Project&#13;
A. Lessons Learned and Results of Previous Bank Involvement&#13;
6.            The proliferation of small, incoordinated donor-financed projects has in the past overtaxed&#13;
MAEF's sector management capacity, leading to parallel implementation arrangements, insufficient&#13;
counterpart funds, lack of commitment by Government to implement them, and contradictory philosophies&#13;
of development. This approach needs to be replaced with long-term national programs. Synergy between&#13;
agricultural services is best achieved when projects are under common management. Experience under the&#13;
Gueckedou Agricultural Development Project and the First Agricultural Services Project (Credits&#13;
1635/1636-GUI), for which Perfornance Audit Reports are available, shows that it is essential to: (a) have&#13;
flexible and simple program designs with clear objectives and well-defined management structures; (b)&#13;
ensure timely availability of counterpart funds; and (c) avoid complex co-financing arrangements. Draft&#13;
Implementation Completion Reports are also available for the recently completed Livestock Sector&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1725-GUI) and the National Seeds Project (Cr. 1864-GUI). The main lessons&#13;
learned from the successful Livestock Rehabilitation Project are the importance of: (a) a proper&#13;
macroeconomic incentive framework; (b) good identification and preparation which highlight the main&#13;
difficulties facing the subsector; (c) regular supervision missions staffed with the right skills and including&#13;
cofinanciers; (d) constructive dialogue with the line implementing agency; and (e) training for project staff&#13;
and beneficiaries (herders). Experience with this project also highlighted the problems associated with&#13;
inadequate counterpart funding. Major lessons learned from the less successful Seeds project are: (a) the&#13;
need to create a demand for improved technology through effective agricultural support services (research&#13;
and extension) and appropriate pricing policies; (b) the importance of involving private sector stakeholders&#13;
at the outset to develop a private seeds industry; and (c) the importance of strong management based on the&#13;
development of local capacity, with less reliance on expatriate technical assistance. All of these lessons&#13;
have been incorporated in the design of the present project and plans for its implementation and&#13;
supervision.&#13;
7.            A quantitative impact evaluation of extension activities supported under the Agricultural&#13;
Research and Extension Project (Cr. 1955-GUI) is currently underway. It is based on a random sample of&#13;
1,024 farmers. The final results should be available by April 1996, after the rice harvest. Preliminary&#13;
results indicate that the extension program is working satisfactorily: (a) 61 percent of the sample of farmers&#13;
indicated that they knew of the program's existence; (b) 26 percent reported that they had received advice&#13;
directly from an extension agent; (c) nearly all farmers (92 percent) receiving extension advice considered it&#13;
to be "very useful" and deemed it important for the extension service to continue disseminating messages&#13;
on imnproved practices (95 percent). When asked to rate the impact on crop output of the extension&#13;
recommendations they had adopted, 59 percent of these farmers rated it as "very successful" and 39&#13;
percent as "successful".&#13;
B. Project Rationale and Objectives&#13;
8.            The agricultural sector in Guinea has great potential for responding rapidly to a carefully&#13;
designed investment program in agriculture with special emphasis on the provision of agricultural services&#13;
(technology generation and dissemination, and improved animal health and husbandry practices).&#13;
Agriculture can play a significant role in the economic adjustment process by providing the initial supply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
response needed to stimulate economic activities, and also by reducing food imports and providing a&#13;
sustainable source of export earnings to support long-term economic growth. If the anticipated growth is to&#13;
materialize, MAEF's policy formulation and coordination capacity needs to be strengthened, and greater&#13;
efficiency in service delivery and in the provision of aid will be essential. Donor support to Guinean&#13;
agriculture needs to be well coordinated and MAEF needs to regain control over externally funded projects.&#13;
Under the NASP, there would be a partnership between the Government and donors for the provision of&#13;
agricultural services. The Government would be responsible for identifying and preparing its priority&#13;
programs, and would work with donors to improve the efficiency and sustainability of those programs,&#13;
without sacrificing ownership.&#13;
9.            The NASP is a direct successor to two ongoing operations financed by IDA and other&#13;
donors -- the Livestock Sector Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1725-GUI) and the Agricultural Research and&#13;
Extension Project (Cr. 1955-GUI) -- and would build on their achievements. It would also be closely&#13;
coordinated with the IDA-financed Rural Resources Management Project which is scheduled for Board&#13;
presentation in FYI 997. The NASP's overall development objective is to improve nationwide agricultural&#13;
productivity and production, incomes of farmers and food security. The operation is designed to: (i)&#13;
reshape the public sector role to complement the private sector and support private sector led growth; (ii)&#13;
develop human capital, i.e., the knowledge and skills of both professionals (researchers, extension agents&#13;
and livestock specialists) and farmers; and (iii) improve MAEF's capacity to provide services that are&#13;
"public goods" and to arrest environmental degradation. The project's imnplementation objectives are to:&#13;
(a) strengthen the field presence and technical capacity of MAEF in the areas of sectoral policy&#13;
formulation, project and donor coordination, and agricultural statistics; (b) strengthen agricultural&#13;
extension to accelerate the dissemination of appropriate and sustainable technologies, and increase land and&#13;
labor productivity; (c) improve agricultural research's output of appropriate technologies for increased&#13;
productivity; (d) improve animal production and veterinary support services to herders; and (e) increase&#13;
responsiveness to social and gender issues as well as environmental concems.&#13;
10.          The NASP is consistent with the Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS) for Guinea,&#13;
which was presented to the Board in February 1994. It is the first step in a strategy to move towards&#13;
integrated investment lending in the agricultural sector, and constitutes the first in a series of time slices&#13;
fmanced under a long-term program. It is cofinanced by several donors and links key subsectors of the&#13;
agricultural investment program more closely. It was prepared primarily by Guinean task forces, including&#13;
broadly-based participation of stakeholders in the definition of agricultural research priorities. It will be&#13;
implemented by MAEF without the creation of separate project units. IDA's strategy in supporting NASP&#13;
is to focus on the provision of basic, core agricultural services and to concentrate on systemic solutions in&#13;
the form of time slices within long-term national programs.&#13;
C. Summary Program/Project Description&#13;
11.          The overall agricultural services program is being supported by the European Union (EU),&#13;
France (MC and CfD), and IDA. Project preparation for the NASP started in November 1994 when a joint&#13;
Borrower/lDA mission provided advice on expanding the scope of agricultural services throughout the&#13;
country. A Project Preparation Facility advance of $1.0 million was granted in October 1995 to finance&#13;
project start-up and prepare project executing agency staff for integrating previous projects' activities into&#13;
the new national program. The NASP has four components: (a) institutional capacity building in MAEF;&#13;
(b) agricultural extension; (c) agricultural research; and (d) livestock and animal health. It will be executed&#13;
by some 3,000 of MAEF's 9,000 staff (SNPRV/extension -- 1,700; IRAG/research -- 600; DNE/animal&#13;
health -- 600; BCPA/policy coordination; and DNA/agricultural field offices -- 100). The EU is financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
animal health, genetic selection of milk cattle, animal traction, and slaughter and marketing facilities in&#13;
certain parts of the country, as well as agricultural research in one of the six research stations. France is&#13;
financing technical assistance for IRAG through its Ministry of Cooperation (MC), and the component to&#13;
strengthen producer organizations, and support to the development of poultry and small ruminants through&#13;
its Caisse fran,aise de Developpement (CfD). The IDA project would cover the remaining gaps for policy&#13;
analysis, project coordination, and agricultural statistics; agricultural extension; agricultural research in the&#13;
remaining five research stations; and animal health and livestock marketing and processing in the areas not&#13;
funded by EU. This four-year, US$90.5 million program (about US$22.6 million/year) represents about&#13;
40 percent of the Government's annual public expenditure in agriculture, and will give farmers throughout&#13;
the country access to quality agricultural services. Donor support by component is shown in Table 1.&#13;

(Base cost - US$6.9 million; 9 percent of total base costs)&#13;
12.          To improve the capacity for policy formulation and coordination of donors and projects,&#13;
the project would provide professional advisory services and staff training in economic analysis to the&#13;
Agricultural Policy Coordination Office (BCPA) of MAEF. With this support, BCPA would carry out&#13;
several policy and organizational studies. Two of the priority studies to be carried out by BCPA would be:&#13;
(a) a study aimed at reorganizing and streamlining the National Agriculture Department (DNA) inter alia&#13;
through a redefinition of its functions and redeployment of staff; and (b) a study analyzing the Borrower's&#13;
current agricultural input distribution system with a view to increasing its efficiency and encouraging the&#13;
development of a private sector input distribution system. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that&#13;
the study conceming the reorganization and streamlining of DNA, and the policy study concerming the&#13;
agricultural input system, would be carried out and completed by September 30, 1996. The results and&#13;
recommendations of these two studies will be presented to IDA for its review and comment before&#13;
December 31, 1996 (para. 35 (a)). In addition, and based on the findings of the Guinea Public Expenditure&#13;
Review of December 1995 and issues addressed in the "Agricultural Policy Note", BCPA would carry out&#13;
inter alia the following policy studies: (c) review of the existing agricultural sector investment program in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
order to determine the associated recurrent costs and to identify possibilities for cost recovery through,&#13;
inter alia, introduction of a levy on commercial crops, and/or user fees for services delivered by MAEF&#13;
(rural roads, land titling, extension advice); and (d) agricultural sector review with special emphasis on an&#13;
analysis of how best to encourage private sector investments, improve agricultural marketing, and stimulate&#13;
agricultural exports. These studies will be carried out and completed by September 30, 1997, and their&#13;
results and recommendations will be submitted to IDA for review and comment not later than December&#13;
31, 1997 (para. 35 (a)). Thereafter, the Borrower will promptly implement the recommendations of these&#13;
four studies as agreed upon and in accordance with a timetable satisfactory to IDA, and taking into account&#13;
all measures required to update the agricultural policy letter which was submitted to IDA under the&#13;
National Agricultural Export Promotion Project (Cr. 2407-GUI).&#13;
13.   The project would also finance support for: (i) MAEF's agricultural statistics office to produce&#13;
reliable data; and (ii) rehabilitation of MAEF's office space for staff at the regional and departmental&#13;
levels.&#13;
14.           The project would support the formulation and implementation of a pilot operation&#13;
(entrepreneurship capacity building scheme) to encourage MAEF employees, especially those who are&#13;
already engaged in subsidiary economic activities, to leave the public sector and become private&#13;
entrepreneurs. An information campaign for all MAEF employees would be carried out, explaining all&#13;
aspects of the operation. During an initial short training module, applicants would be screened for their&#13;
aptitude as business people. Successful candidates would then receive further tailor-made training directly&#13;
related to the kind of business they would like to engage in and would be assisted in preparing their&#13;
investment projects and in obtaining credit on commercial terms. The precise procedures to be followed&#13;
would be modeled on the success in this field of the private enterprise development project "PRIDE"&#13;
financed by USAID and executed by the NGOs VITA and PRIDE/Guinee. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that the Borrower shall: (a) not later than December 31, 1996, carry out a detailed design&#13;
study required to develop the entrepreneurship capacity building scheme; (b) submit the results and&#13;
recommendations of this study to IDA for review and comment; and (c) promptly thereafter, implement this&#13;
scheme in accordance with the implementation modalities and schedule agreed upon with IDA. This study&#13;
would include, inter alia, a determination of the kind of separation benefits, over and above training and&#13;
access to credit, that would be needed to induce people to leave MAEF in favor of private sector&#13;
entrepreneurship, and of the practical steps needed during the transition period (para. 35 (b)). Government&#13;
would sub-contract this pilot operation to VITA PRIDE/Guinee and financing of up to US$2.0 million&#13;
would be set aside for the training of future entrepreneurs (US$0.2 million) and for credit for their new&#13;
enterprises (US$1.8 million). Receipt of a report and recommendations on implementation modalities and&#13;
schedule satisfactory to IDA for this entrepreneurship capacity building scheme, will be a condition of&#13;
disbursement of IDA funding for this scheme (para. 37). Separation benefits would not be financed by&#13;
IDA; other donors have expressed their interest in financing such benefits if the feasibility study is&#13;
conclusive. After an initial, specially designed information campaign, the first training module would be&#13;
launched in July 1996. These training modules would be repeated every three months, and it is expected&#13;
that some 500 MAEF employees would participate during the two-year pilot phase. Based on the&#13;
experience of PRIDE to date, it is expected that some 30 percent of the participants would become&#13;
successful entrepreneurs and would leave the Ministry. Before July 31, 1997 and during the mid-term&#13;
review, results of this pilot operation would be evaluated to make the necessary adjustments and if feasible,&#13;
accelerate its rate of implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
Agricultural Extension Component&#13;
(Base cost - US$3 1.0 million; 39 percent of total base cost)&#13;
15.          The main objective of this component would be to provide a continuous flow of&#13;
appropriate extension recommendations to Guinea's 670,000 farm families. The extension service (Service&#13;
National de la Promotion Rurale et de Vulgarisation - SNPRV) would be in direct contact with about&#13;
200,000 farmers (organized into about 20,000 contact groups) through some 1,300 field extension workers,&#13;
backed up by supervisors and Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs). All farmers would be encouraged to&#13;
apply and test technical recommendations in small plots or on selected animals and to adopt new&#13;
technologies more widely. On the qualitative side, the project would seek to:&#13;
(a)    further decentralize the management of the SNPRV and improve management of the&#13;
logistical aspects of the extension service;&#13;
(b)    continue to upgrade the skills of staff at all levels through continuous tailor-made training.&#13;
A training and human resource management program would be carried out, including (i)&#13;
fortnightly training of extension staff by subject matter specialists; (ii) monthly&#13;
technological review meetings involving research and extension staff, and farmers; (iii)&#13;
training of farmer organization specialists; (iv) training in field diagnosis, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, and surveys; (v) training of trainers; (vi) training in supervisory techniques;&#13;
(vii) management training; (viii) training in techniques involved in carrying out tests and&#13;
trials in farmers' fields; and (ix) study tours inside the country and abroad.&#13;
(c)    continue to improve the "diagnostic skills" of front-line extension agents;&#13;
(d)    further expand the achievements of the completed IDA-funded Agricultural Seeds Project&#13;
(Cr. 1864-GUI) and popularize improved varieties through formal and informal&#13;
distribution channels;&#13;
(e)    strengthen the existing monitoring and evaluation system by introducing systematic client&#13;
consultation and "beneficiary assessments";&#13;
(f)    promote, strengthen and work more closely with farmer organizations through the&#13;
provision of advice to farmers for the organization and management of groups and&#13;
associations, and better access to commercial marketing and supply outlets, credit&#13;
institutions, and seed producers, plant and improved livestock breeders; and&#13;
(g)    broaden extension recommendations to cover not only production aspects, but also crop&#13;
protection, natural resource management, and storage, processing and marketing.&#13;
16.          The project would finance training, and acquisition of 4-wheel drive vehicles, motorcycles&#13;
and bicycles for 1,700 extension staff, short-term consultant services, equipment and a modest amount of&#13;
civil works for the rehabilitation of existing buildings. During the first year, the project will also support&#13;
the launching of pilot extension initiatives to: (a) improve the quality of extension recommendations by&#13;
putting more emphasis on their economic and financial aspects; (b) develop a mass communications&#13;
strategy to support face-to-face extension activities; and (c) develop contractual relationships with&#13;
specialized NGOs in extension support activities. More pilot operations may be identified and executed&#13;
over the life of the NASP. Government will formulate projects for the identified pilot initiatives, as needed,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
and obtain IDA's non-objection before implementation. Lessons learned from the pilot initiatives will be&#13;
appropriately adapted and then mainstreamed.&#13;
A2ricultural Research Component&#13;
(Base cost - US$20.3 million; 25 percent of total base cost)&#13;
17.           The main objective of this component would be to build a sustainable agricultural research&#13;
capacity within Guinea's agricultural research institute (Institut de Recherche Agronomique de Guinee -&#13;
IRAG) that responds to farmers' needs by developing appropriate technologies. The NASP will support&#13;
priority research programs and the evaluation of professional staff working in research. An on-the-job&#13;
training and scientific tutoring program will be developed for the researchers and implemented with the help&#13;
of existing French technical assistance. In addition, young graduates will be recruited and further training&#13;
will be provided locally or abroad. The Institute will be reorganized to: (a) adjust the composition and&#13;
functions of its governing bodies; (b) separate financial and accounting functions from that of procurement;&#13;
(c) create a position for internal auditing and human resource management at IRAG headquarters; (d)&#13;
create a position of station manager at each research center. The project will also support continuing&#13;
improvement in research organization and management by: (a) improving the relevance of research by&#13;
involving extension agents and farmers in the programming, monitoring and evaluation of research&#13;
activities; (b) strengthening the autonomy of IRAG, as well as its accountability, by granting more&#13;
decision-making power to its Board of Directors and its management; and (c) ensuring higher quality and&#13;
more efficient research. To this end, a system for ongoing performance evaluation and reward will be put&#13;
in place, based on a researcher "statute" to be included in the revised organizational rules and procedures&#13;
of IRAG; (d) improving the logistical and financial management of IRAG; (e) rationalizing IRAG's&#13;
network of experimental stations and laboratories, and improving management and maintenance of&#13;
infrastructures through systematic on-the-job training; and (f) participating closely in regional research&#13;
within the SPAAR framework. The credit provide funding for research activities only in the following&#13;
centers: Koba, S&amp;edou, Bordo, Foulaya, Bareng, and Kilissi (excluding the seed production center). The&#13;
agro-processing laboratory at Foulaya will be rehabilitated during the third year of project implementation,&#13;
once the agro-processing research team has been constituted.&#13;
18.          The following assurances were obtained at negotiations.  The Borrower  shall, by&#13;
December 31, 1996, reorganize IRAG as required to increase its overall efficiency including, inter alia, by&#13;
establishing personnel rules and adopting an operational manual, all satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
Furthermore, the Borrower shall cause IRAG to: (a) carry on its operations and conduct its affairs im&#13;
accordance with sound administrative, financial and research practices under the supervision of qualified&#13;
and experienced management assisted by competent staff in adequate numbers; (b) (i) carry out by&#13;
December 31, 1996, a comprehensive assessment of the competency skills of its research staff; and (ii) by&#13;
March 31, 1997, formulate and thereafter promptly implement a career development plan designed to&#13;
attract and retain talented research staff within IRAG; (c) (i) submit to the Association for its review and&#13;
comments the draft competency skills assessment report and career development plan referred to in&#13;
paragraph (a) above; and (ii) promptly finalize and implement them in accordance with the&#13;
recommendations and timetable agreed upon with the Association; and (d) enhance its financial&#13;
management system by not later than December 31, 1997, by adopting appropriate procedure to record all&#13;
of its expenditures through a cost accounting methodology acceptable to the Association (para. 35 (c)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
Livestock and Animal Health ComDonent&#13;
(Base Cost - US$21.2 million; 26 percent of total base cost)&#13;
19.          The main objective of this component would be to increase the productivity of Guinean&#13;
livestock, thereby augmenting national meat and milk production and improving nutrition, and raising the&#13;
income and standard of living of herders. It would have four main sub-components:&#13;
(a)   Improved Animal Health would be achieved through increased vaccination coverage&#13;
against gazetted diseases (CBPP, Rinderpest, peste des petits ruminants), and improved&#13;
drug distribution. Vaccination, currently a public service, is gradually being transferred to&#13;
private veterinarians operating under contract (the so-called mandat sanitaire). All&#13;
vaccinations will eventually be carried out by private operators. The Government&#13;
pharmaceuticals procurement agency (CAVET) is scheduled for privatization before&#13;
September 30, 1996. Drug import and distribution, already 50 percent private, will then&#13;
be entirely private.&#13;
(b)   Institutional Support - Government staff will be retained to carry out "public good"&#13;
services (collection of sectoral economic data, public health duties), and to help support&#13;
herder and other professional organizations (livestock traders, butchers) so they can&#13;
modernize their operations. Headquarters staff will further develop their capacity to devise&#13;
development policies and monitor their implementation.&#13;
(c)    Animal production systems improvement will be achieved through support to village&#13;
poultry production, to peri-urban poultry and pig farming, to regional dairy development&#13;
and animal traction, as well as through support to the modernization of livestock and&#13;
animal product marketing facilities. Village poultry production would be boosted through&#13;
the development of vaccination coverage against Newcastle disease by grassroots&#13;
auxiliaries operating in cooperation with village associations and private veterinarians (an&#13;
activity that has already started). Breeding for improved dairy production will be further&#13;
developed around Boke and Beyla based on the "open nucleus selection system" involving&#13;
village herds around the breeding stations. New traditional milk processing technologies&#13;
will be introduced (manufacture of Wara cheese), and dairy product marketing will be left&#13;
entirely to the private sector. A credit scheme will help finance semi-modem peri-urban&#13;
pig and egg-layer farms operated by qualified technicians no longer employed by&#13;
Government.&#13;
(d)    Infrastructure and natural resources management support - holding pens and concrete slabs&#13;
would be built for the marketing and slaughter of animals, under a commitment from users&#13;
to manage and maintain them and collect fees for that purpose. Similarly, small pastoral&#13;
infrastructures (drinking troughs, cattle crushes, access tracks) would be developed on a&#13;
matching grant basis with the contribution of beneficiaries, in order to help improve&#13;
natural resource management and conservation, and on the basis of the commitment of&#13;
herders to maintain the facilities.&#13;
ResDonsiveness to Social. Gender, and Environmental Issues&#13;
(Costs included under the other components)&#13;
20.          All project components include actions to improve the social and gender responsiveness of&#13;
the agricultural support services: a small unit will be created inside the SNPRV at the national level and&#13;
selected female agents will act as socio-cultural SMSs at the regional level; all extension agents will receive&#13;
training on how to deal effectively with different target groups; transformation and conservation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
technologies (typically women's activities) will be introduced into the research and extension agendas;&#13;
promising income-generating activities will be tested with women's groups; and female leaders will be&#13;
trained in group and financial management.&#13;
21.          All project components also include actions to reduce possible negative effects of&#13;
agricultural production technologies on the natural environment and to enhance their positive impact. To&#13;
this end, a mitigation plan will be put in place and its implementation will be assessed during the mid-term&#13;
review. This mitigation plan -- funded under the project -- will consist of the following five elements:&#13;
(a)    careful evaluation and selection of agricultural technologies that have a positive impact on&#13;
the natural environment, with heavy emphasis on soil and water conservation practices and&#13;
agroforestry;&#13;
(b)    environmental training (for staff) and a mass communications plan;&#13;
(c)   training of farmers and their organizations to deal with soil degradation problems;&#13;
(d)    environmental monitoring actions in related areas; and&#13;
(e)    adaptive research activities geared towards these issues.&#13;
All of these activities will be carried out by staff of executing agencies (extension and livestock agents and&#13;
researchers) with short-term technical assistance.&#13;
E. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
22.          The total base cost of the project, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at about 78.7 billion&#13;
Guinean Francs (US$80.4 million equivalent). The base cost estimates reflect November 1995 prices.&#13;
Physical contingencies amount to about US$4.4 million and are estimated to be 10 percent of civil works,&#13;
10 percent for goods, 5 percent for other investment costs and for operating costs. Price contingencies,&#13;
amounting to US$5.6 million, represent about 7 percent of total base costs and are based on estimated&#13;
annual forecasts of international inflation rates for foreign manufactured goods (from 1.9 percent to 3.0&#13;
percent) and estimated annual inflation rates in Guinea for local costs (5 percent per annum). Foreign&#13;
exchange portion of total project cost is 40 percent. A summary of total project costs is given in Annex 1.&#13;
23.          The proposed IDA credit of US$35.0 million would finance about 38.8 percent of total&#13;
program costs of US$90.5 million, including 55 percent of foreign exchange and 28 percent of local costs.&#13;
In addition, the project would be financed by: (a) Government contribution of US$26.7 million equivalent,&#13;
mostly for salaries (US$23.5 million) and recurrent expenditures; (b) beneficiary contributions of US$1.0&#13;
million equivalent, mainly in the form of labor and local building materials, and (c) cofinancing&#13;
contributions of US$27.8 million, distributed as follows: US$10.9 million equivalent from the European&#13;
Union (EU); US$11.1 million equivalent from the French Ministry of Cooperation (MC); and US$5.8&#13;
million equivalent from the Caisse francaise de Developpement (CfD). Taxes and duties foregone,&#13;
estimated at about US$20.5 million, represent the Government's additional contribution but are not&#13;
included in the total project costs. To ensure timely availability of adequate counterpart funds&#13;
(US$800,000 per year), assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Borrower will: (a) open and&#13;
maintain an account (the Project Account) in a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the&#13;
Association; (b) deposit into the Project Account an initial amount equivalent to US$300,000; (c)&#13;
thereafter, deposit into the Project Account by the first day of each calendar quarter, an amount equivalent&#13;
to US$200,000 or such other amount as shall have been agreed upon at the beginning of each fiscal year&#13;
between the Borrower and the Association in the light of the budgetary requirements of the Project; and (d)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
ensure that funds deposited in the Project Account shall be used only for the purposes of defraying the cost&#13;
of expenditures incurred for the execution of the Project (para. 35 (d)). The initial deposit of US$300,000&#13;
equivalent will be a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 36 (a)).&#13;
F. Procurement, Disbursement, Accounts and Auditing&#13;
24.          Details of procurement, disbursement, accounts and auditing are provided in Annex 2.&#13;
The main executing agencies (SNPRV, IRAG and DNE) have satisfactory financial management systems&#13;
in place and are fully familiar with Bank procedures concerning procurement, disbursements, and&#13;
accounting and auditing. IDA would finance: (a) goods totaling about US$9.1 million to be procured&#13;
through international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures; (b) works and goods totaling about US$1.0&#13;
million to be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures; and (c) goods and services&#13;
totaling about US$25.0 million to be procured through other procedures, including international and local&#13;
shopping for goods and short lists for consultants' services. The project's three cofinanciers would&#13;
administer procurement for their share of the financing according to their respective rules and procedures.&#13;
The proposed IDA Credit of US$35.0 million equivalent would be disbursed over four years, with&#13;
disbursements to be completed by December 31, 2000. IDA funds for agricultural research would be made&#13;
available by the Borrower to IRAG as a grant, under a grant agreement to be entered into between the&#13;
Borrower and IRAG and satisfactory to IDA. Execution of this grant agreement on behalf of the Borrower&#13;
and IRAG is a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 36 (b)). To facilitate disbursements, a special&#13;
account would be established for each executing agency and operated in a commercial bank, under terms&#13;
and conditions satisfactory to IDA. All cofinancing would be on a parallel basis and administered by each&#13;
donor.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained that project accounts will be audited by&#13;
international, independent auditors under TORs acceptable to IDA and reports on such statements will be&#13;
provided within six months after the close of each fiscal year (para. 35 (e)). The contracting of independent&#13;
auditors, on a multi-year basis, and certification by auditors that the accounting system of each&#13;
implementing agency is operational, is a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 36 (c)).&#13;
G. Project Implementation&#13;
25.          MAEF would have overall responsibility for implementing the NASP and no parallel&#13;
administrative project units would be created. Each of the executing agencies, i.e., BCPA, SNPRV, IRAG,&#13;
and DNE would be responsible for the execution of their respective components.  The NASP&#13;
implementation manual was reviewed during negotiations and its adoption is a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness (para. 36 (d)). Thereafter, the Borrower will take all measures necessary to ensure that the&#13;
Project is carried out in conformity with the project implementation manual (PIM) and shall not make any&#13;
change to the PIM which would materially or adversely affect the execution of the Project; and maintain&#13;
policies and procedures adequate to enable it to monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance&#13;
with indicators satisfactory to IDA, the carrying out of the Project and the achievement of its objectives.&#13;
To coordinate implementation of all NASP components, assurances were obtained during negotiations that&#13;
the Borrower will establish by June 30, 1996, and thereafter maintain: (a) (i) a Project Steering Committee;&#13;
and (ii) a Project Technical committee, all with membership and functions and responsibilities satisfactory&#13;
to Association; and (b) ensure that each technical department of MAEF responsible for carrying out any&#13;
part of the Project is headed at all times by staff with experience and qualifications satisfactory to the&#13;
Association (para. 35 (f)). The chairman of the NASP Steering Committee would be the Secretary General&#13;
of MAEF and members would comprise the Directors of the executing agencies, the Director of the Rural&#13;
Resources Management Project, senior officials from the Ministries of Plan and Finance, and&#13;
representatives of  the private sector (farmers' organizations).  BCPA would be responsible for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
consolidating the annual work program, preparing sector budgets for approval of the NASP Steering&#13;
Committee, and coordinate with donors on annual reviews, supervision missions and implementation issues.&#13;
The Steering Committee would have a sub-committee on environmental impact monitoring, composed of&#13;
the Directors of BCPA, the Rural Resources Management Project, the PNAE, and the NGO Guinee&#13;
Ecologie. The Project Technical Committee would be composed of the Directors of the executing agencies.&#13;
In addition, during negotiations the following assurances were obtained: (a) by September 30 of each year,&#13;
MAEF would submit its draft annual work programs, investment proposals and related budgets for each&#13;
project component to IDA for its review and comments; (b) by November 30 of each year, finalize the said&#13;
work programs and related budgets by taking duly into account the comments and recommendations made&#13;
by IDA; and (c) promptly thereafter, carry out the work programs as they shall have been finalized in&#13;
agreement with IDA. Finally, the Borrower has agreed to ensure that any new investments to be made for&#13;
the purposes of fostering agricultural extension, research and livestock development activities are included&#13;
in the MAEF's work program; meet criteria of economic return acceptable to IDA; and have the funding&#13;
required to cover their anticipated recurrent costs available through the Borrower's budget (para. 35(g)).&#13;
H. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
26.          Details on the project's monitoring and evaluation arrangements, including the key&#13;
performance indicators, are provided in Annex 3. Each executing agency already has a monitoring and&#13;
evaluation (M&amp;E) system, that will be further strengthened under NASP. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that MAEF and the executing agencies will maintain a project monitoring and evaluation&#13;
system satisfactory to IDA, including adequate policies and procedures to enable monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of NASP on an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators satisfactory to IDA. At Project completion&#13;
and not later than six months after the Closing Date (December 31, 2000) the Borrower will furnish to IDA&#13;
a plan for the future operation of the project (para. 35 (h)). In addition, a joint mid-term review by the&#13;
Borrower, IDA, and the co-financiers would be carried out not later than March 31, 1998 to assess the&#13;
progress achieved in the execution of the project (para. 35 (i)).  This review will cover: (a) the&#13;
implementation and management aspects of the project, including policy reforms, the performance and use&#13;
of technical assistance personnel, the role of national counterpart staff, the status and results of training,&#13;
reporting, accounting and audit performance, disbursement and procurement procedures, the functioning&#13;
and the level of amounts deposited in the Project Account, and the progress achieved in the formulation and&#13;
execution of the voluntary departure pilot scheme; (b) not later than thirty (30) days prior to the mid-term&#13;
review, the Borrower shall furnish to IDA, for its comments, a detailed report, including an evaluation of&#13;
the progress achieved in implementing the various components of the project, and a draft action plan&#13;
containing proposals for remedying identified deficiencies; (c) the Borrower shall, promptly thereafter (i)&#13;
prepare and adopt an action plan, acceptable to IDA, based on the recommendations stemming from the&#13;
aforementioned review; and (ii) thereafter, carry out the said action plan for the remaining period of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
m1. Assessments&#13;
A. Technical Assessment&#13;
27.          The design of NASP is based on the experience gained in the implementation of two,&#13;
ongoing, IDA-funded projects and is technically sound. Design of the agricultural extension component is&#13;
based on Training and Visit (T&amp;V) management principles that have been internalized, have proven their&#13;
effectiveness, and are being applied flexibly (see Annex 6). In addition, through pilot operations that were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
started in 1994, a methodology for farmer participatory research has been developed and is now being used&#13;
systematically by SNPRV. Hence, extension recommendations are developed jointly between researchers,&#13;
extension agents and farmers and are situation-specific. This has been facilitated through considerable&#13;
investments in training (abroad and in-service) of staff, especially Subject Matter Specialists. Special&#13;
attention has been given to attune the extension service to women farmers' needs and to involve NGOs in&#13;
service delivery. Finally, with support from CfD, producer organizations are being strengthened, which in&#13;
turn facilitates the task of developing and providing extension advice. In the design of the research&#13;
component, care was taken to address all the fundamental weaknesses of IRAG and to systematically build&#13;
up its research capacity. Research priorities were defined with Bank support through a participatory&#13;
method that brought together all the major stakeholders. All activities under the livestock and animal health&#13;
component are extension of activities that were already successfully carried out under the IDA financed&#13;
Livestock Sector Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1725-GUI).&#13;
B. Institutional Assessment&#13;
28.           SNPRV is the successor organization of the IDA-financed national extension program and&#13;
its management and staff are competent and dynamic. Since 1987, when pilot extension activities were&#13;
started with Bank support, management and staff have gained considerable experience through learning-by-&#13;
doing, short-term technical assistance, various types of training, and support from Bank and other donor&#13;
missions. Expansion of the size of the extension service and its geographic coverage has been gradual,&#13;
thereby allowing adequate time to build up management capacity and carefully select and train new staff.&#13;
IRAG on the other hand, has been less successful in benefiting from the support that was provided under&#13;
IDA financing. IRAG lacks competent researchers and its research management, as well as human,&#13;
financial and physical resources management is still weak. The Ministry has agreed to a series of remedial&#13;
measures: giving greater autonomy to IRAG, hiring a few young researchers every year on contract to&#13;
rejuvenate the institute, and carrying out a formal evaluation of all researchers to define training needs of&#13;
each researcher. In addition, MC has agreed to change the terms of reference of its technical assistance&#13;
inside IRAG to place much more emphasis on scientific tutoring and training of Guinean researchers than&#13;
in the past. Finally, management of research has been strengthened by appointing one scientific director&#13;
per station to be responsible for the quality of all research activities, and by introducing closer supervision&#13;
from the scientific director of IRAG. DNE, which was completely restructured under the Livestock&#13;
Rehabilitation Project and had all of its staff has retrained, is competent to fulfill the tasks assigned to it&#13;
under the NASP.&#13;
C. Economic Assessment&#13;
29.           Given the large size and composite nature of the current project, the overall assessment of&#13;
its economic viability is based on several criteria: (a) traditional cost-benefit analysis for the livestock&#13;
component, (b) cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis for the extension and research components, and&#13;
(c) fiscal impact analysis of the whole project. Most of the benefits from the livestock component would&#13;
come from increased beef and milk production in cattle herds with better animal health and a more&#13;
conducive institutional environment. The rate of growth of the cattle herd is assumed to increase from 1.0&#13;
percent in 1996 to 1.35 percent by the year 2009. Similarly, milk production would increase by about 30&#13;
percent over the same time span. Under these assumptions, the National Directorate of Livestock estimates&#13;
that the ERR would be around 30 percent. An independent ex-post estimate of the ERR for similar&#13;
investments financed under the recently completed Livestock Services Rehabilitation Project was found to&#13;
be 18 percent. Concerning research and extension, there is wide scope for increasing returns. Current crop&#13;
yields are low and over the past five years, 50 percent of farmers have adopted one or more technical&#13;
messages extended by SNPRV. The agricultural research and extension components will contribute to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
improved crop and animal husbandry practices and to developing and disseminating new agricultural&#13;
technology. Monitoring and evaluation surveys by SNPRV indicate that with existing technology, crop&#13;
yields have increased by about 30 percent for farmers having direct contact with the national extension&#13;
service. Ex-post and independent measures of the economic impact of agricultural extension in countries&#13;
with lower agricultural potential than Guinea suggest returns ranging from 70 to 100 percent. A combined&#13;
ERR was estimated at 46 percent, assuming that the national agricultural extension service will cover 50&#13;
percent of the territory by the year 2000 (up from 30 percent currently) and that about 70 percent of rice&#13;
farmers (compared with less than 50 percent current) would adopt the improved technical messages. Key&#13;
assumptions on area covered, adoption rates and yield increases by crop and by natural region are in Annex&#13;
4, pages 11 to 13. Under the recently completed National Research and Extension Project (Cr. 1955-GUI),&#13;
it was estimated that to achieve a 25 percent ERR, aggregate crop yield would have to increase by 15&#13;
percent between 1988 and 1995. Actual rice yield increased by 44 percent, cassava 50 percent, groundnut&#13;
33 percent, and maize 11 percent in areas covered by the national service. This suggest that the 46 percent&#13;
ERR is reasonable and can be obtained from the proposed project, especially given that the project will&#13;
foster synergy between livestock and agricultural activities, leading to positive externalities on higher crop&#13;
yields particularly in transhumance areas of Guinea Maritime.&#13;
D. Financial Assessment&#13;
30.           Annual expenditures for the services covered under the project as a percentage of the&#13;
agricultural GDP in 1994 (US$750 million) are as follows: research - 0.7 percent; extension - 0.8 percent;&#13;
and livestock services - 0.7 percent. These percentages are well within international norms for these kinds&#13;
of public expenditures. All three components were carefully tailored to the absorptive capacity of the&#13;
respective executing agencies, and the proposed investments constitute least-cost solutions. The project&#13;
support to institutional strengthening, including a much needed restructuring of MAEF, would have a&#13;
positive impact on public finances and can be expected over time to lower the salary bill. For more detailed&#13;
information, see the economic analysis in Annex 4. By integrating ongoing and future investments in&#13;
research, extension and livestock services into national programs, the unit costs for these services will be&#13;
lowered significantly. Especially in the case of extension, the unit costs per farm fanily will be lowered&#13;
from between US$20 - US$100, depending on the type of crop- or area-based extension project, to US$10&#13;
for the SNPRV under the NASP. In the case of livestock services, pharmaceuticals are sold on a&#13;
commercial basis and herders pay 200 GNF per animal and vaccination, which constitutes 50 percent of&#13;
the costs for these services. Overall, the proposed project would generate estimated annual incremental&#13;
recurrent cost of US$6.5 million equivalent in 1995 prices, representing 6 percent of total public&#13;
expenditures on agriculture in 1994. Given the low income of a large proportion of the rural population,&#13;
cost recovery at this time would have adverse welfare implications. However, the possibilities for partial&#13;
cost recovery of agricultural services will be analyzed as part of the review of MAEF's current investment&#13;
program and its associated recurrent costs (see para. 12).&#13;
E. Environmental Assessment&#13;
31.           The NASP is rated "B" for environmental assessment purposes, and an environmental&#13;
analysis was carried out during August/September 1995. The report (available in the Project File)&#13;
concludes that the NASP would have a neutral or positive impact on the natural environment, provided that&#13;
the mitigation plan to be funded under the project, described in para. 21, is put in place and carried out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
F. Project Sustainability&#13;
32.           After studying the multiplicity of projects in extension, research and livestock development&#13;
carried out in the past, the Government has, on the basis of results and least-cost considerations, committed&#13;
itself to a national program which will integrate ongoing and future efforts in the provision of agricultural&#13;
services. This approach will lower the unit cost of delivering these services and limit it to some US$20 per&#13;
farm family or about 2 percent of agricultural GDP. Expenditures of this magnitude fit within the&#13;
country's public finances and are likely to be sustained over the long term. Through the provision of more&#13;
professional and regular agricultural services, the project will contribute to a growing confidence of the&#13;
farming community in the administration, which should, if successful, ensure longer term sustainability of&#13;
project efforts. Further, the Government will study the possibilities for cost recovery through introduction&#13;
of a cess on commercial crops, and/or some cost recovery for extension advice. Also, under the NASP, the&#13;
Government will pilot initiatives for private sector/NGO participation in extension on a cost-sharing basis.&#13;
Over time, it can be expected that improved prosperity of the farming sector will permit more cost recovery&#13;
and generate a demand for extension services from sources other than those publicly funded. The&#13;
institutional sustainability of the program is enhanced by the fact that there is strong government and&#13;
beneficiary ownership; the program has been designed by Guineans and would use existing channels for&#13;
implementation.&#13;
G. Benefits&#13;
33.           The NASP would benefit the economy in several ways. It would focus the role of the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture on the provision of key agricultural services; increase the efficiency and impact of&#13;
the provision of these services and reduce waste in public expenditures. The institutional improvements in&#13;
extension, research, and animal health would translate into the widespread diffusion and adoption of better&#13;
agricultural technology, increase farmers' productivity, production and incomes, and accelerate the&#13;
agricultural growth rate. The NASP would have a favorable impact on rural poverty alleviation through&#13;
increased crop and livestock production and diversification. Women play important roles in Guinea's&#13;
agricultural sector as farmers, managers, decision makers, farm laborers, and are expected to be major&#13;
beneficiaries of the NASP. Increased incomes for women should result in improved household food&#13;
security, nutrition and health areas where women are largely the decision makers.&#13;
H. Risks&#13;
34.           The risks foreseen include: (i) ineffective management and training of widely scattered&#13;
extension, research and livestock agents; (ii) the failure of Government and/or donors to sustain the long-&#13;
term commitment required to achieve durable improvements in the effectiveness of agricultural support&#13;
services; and (iii) shortage of counterpart funds and long-term  fiscal sustainability.  Concerning&#13;
agricultural services, good management is expected as a result of the application of T&amp;V management&#13;
principles, restructuring of research, and improving the linkages among extension, research, and farmers.&#13;
Performance of the project executing agencies will be assessed through the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
arrangements and through joint support missions in the field by donor agencies. The multi-donor annual&#13;
review of work plans and budgets, as well as the mid-term review, will allow fine-tuning of programs and&#13;
build long-term commitment. Regarding counterpart funds and fiscal sustainability, the reduction of&#13;
independent projects and the reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture will significantly reduce the unit&#13;
costs of these services, and thereby increase the capacity of the Government to fund the single national&#13;
agricultural services program. Also, it is expected that the review of the agricultural sector investment&#13;
program (para. 12) will identify new possibilities for cost recovery.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
2.            Procurement of works and goods financed by the IDA Credit will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with IDA Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995).&#13;
Consultant contracts will be undertaken in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants (August 1981). When National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be permitted, it will be&#13;
carried out in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA with precautions such as: (a) any bidders are&#13;
given sufficient time to submit bids (about four weeks for contracts exceeding US$20,000 equivalent); (b)&#13;
bid evaluation and bidder qualification are clearly specified; (c) no margin of preference is granted to&#13;
domestic contractors or manufacturers; (d) eligible foreign firms are not precluded from participation; (e)&#13;
contracts provide for security in an amount sufficient to protect the Borrower in case of breach of contract&#13;
(without distinction or exception); (f) prior to issuing the first call for bids, draft standard bidding&#13;
documents are submitted to IDA and found acceptable; and (g) award will be made to the lowest evaluated&#13;
bidder.&#13;
3.            Procurement of civil works, goods and consulting services. Procurement arrangements&#13;
for works, goods and services to be financed by the IDA Credit will be as follows:&#13;
(a)    Civil works for small office facilities (totaling about US$1.0 million equivalent - IDA&#13;
financing US$0.7 million) with an average contract value of under US$250,000, will be&#13;
contracted into about 10 contracts and procured through NCB procedures acceptable to&#13;
IDA. Local firms can offer competitive prices, and due to the nature, size of works&#13;
(mainly minor renovation and small rural facilities) and their geographical dispersion, civil&#13;
works are unlikely to attract the interest of foreign bidders. However, any changes made&#13;
in the contract packaging which would result in civil works contracts exceeding US$0.5&#13;
million each would require procurement througlh ICB.&#13;
(b)    Goods including vehicles, agricultural materials, office furniture, equipment and supplies&#13;
(totaling US$9.1 million equivalent) will be procured through ICB in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995).&#13;
Goods costing more than US$25,000 equivalent but less than US$100,000 will be&#13;
procured through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA, provided the aggregate amount of&#13;
such procurement does not exceed US$0.3 million equivalent. Goods costing US$25,000&#13;
or less can be procured through international and national shopping, based on price&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers, provided that the aggregate&#13;
amount of such procurement does not exceed US$200,000 equivalent (international&#13;
shopping - US$100,000 and national shopping - US$100,000).&#13;
(c)    Consulting services (totaling US$10.9 million equivalent) will be awarded in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981). These services&#13;
include: (i) technical specialist services in support of extension and research, and financial&#13;
management and auditing (US$4.0 million), and (ii) training of project related staff in-&#13;
country and abroad (US$4.9 million) delivered by specialized training and research&#13;
institutions, individual trainers, and NGOs. The entrepreneurial capacity building scheme&#13;
would be handled by VITA/PRIDE for which selection will be on a sole source basis found&#13;
acceptable to both parties. Each executing agency will maintain a roster of consultants for&#13;
the establishment of short-lists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
(d)    Incremental Operating Costs (totaling US$16.1 million) financed by IDA include: (i)&#13;
operation and maintenance costs of office equipment, vehicles and motorcycles, spare&#13;
parts, office and laboratory supplies, building maintenance totaling US$11.9 million; (ii)&#13;
in-country travel allowance for supervision staff, instructors and trainees in the amount of&#13;
US$3.2 million; and (iii) salaries for incremental staff in the amount of US$1.0 million.&#13;
Items which cannot be grouped into packages of at least US$25,000 equivalent,&#13;
aggregating not more than US$100,000 equivalent, would be procured through&#13;
international and/or national shopping on the basis of quotations obtained from at least&#13;
three reliable suppliers or at official unit rates for items which are not subject to price&#13;
comparison.&#13;
4.            Review by IDA. For ICB, the Bank's Standard Bidding documents for goods and civil&#13;
works will be used. Draft standard bidding documents for NBC will be reviewed by and agreed upon with&#13;
IDA. IDA-financed contracts for works above a threshold value of US$250,000 equivalent, and for goods&#13;
above US$100,000 equivalent will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures which would cover about&#13;
88 percent of the total value of the arnount contracted. Documentation for contracts under this threshold&#13;
will be maintained for ex-post review by Bank staff and auditors. In addition, for all contracts for which&#13;
there are less than three bidders or for any decision not to select the lowest evaluated bid, the executing&#13;
agency will submit its proposal to IDA for approval prior to notifying the winning bidder. Prior IDA&#13;
review will not apply to consultant contracts with firms or individuals selected from a short list estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$50,000 equivalent for individuals and US$100,000 equivalent for firms. However, the&#13;
exception to prior review of consultant contracts will not apply to the terms of reference (or standard terms&#13;
of reference) for such contracts, to single-source hiring of firms and individuals, to assignment of a critical&#13;
nature (as determined by IDA), and to amendments to contracts raising their value above the US$50,000&#13;
and US$100,000 thresholds respectively.&#13;
5.            Procurement Arrangements. A detailed implementation schedule for works, goods and&#13;
services to be procured under the project was prepared and will be updated on a regular basis. During&#13;
implementation, all bid evaluation reports transmitted to IDA for review will contain an updated copy of&#13;
the procurement schedule. The Government will take the necessary measures to ensure that procurement&#13;
phases do not exceed the following target time periods:&#13;
Maximum number of weeks&#13;
* Preparation of bidding documents                     4&#13;
* Preparation of bids by bidders                       4 (6-8 for ICB)&#13;
* Bid evaluation and contract award                    3&#13;
* Signature of contracts                               2-4&#13;
* Payments                                             3&#13;
6.            Each implementing agency will be responsible for procurement with support for bulk&#13;
procurement from BCPA or ACGP on a case by case basis. Implementation staff have acquired experience&#13;
under the on-going operation and have be trained in IDA procurement procedures. They will receive&#13;
continued updating courses and guidance from the Departmental Implementation Unit and from&#13;
procurement analysts based in resident missions.&#13;

B. Disbursements&#13;
7.            Disbursements will be in accordance with procedures outlined in the World Bank&#13;
Disbursement handbook. The borrower possesses the ability to process and maintain Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOE) documentation in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. Appropriate accounting and&#13;
control systems are in place. Therefore, disbursements for expenditures related to contracts for goods of&#13;
less than US$ 100,000 would be made on the basis of SOEs. Disbursements for operating costs would also&#13;
be made on the basis of SOEs. The SOEs and all records such as contracts, orders, invoices and payroll&#13;
vouchers will be retained by BCPA, which will be responsible for maintaining this information in a manner&#13;
that would facilitate inspection by supervision missions and for review by the external audit.&#13;
Disbursements related to contracts above the SOE limit would be fully documented. The estimated&#13;
quarterly schedule of disbursements is shown below.&#13;
8.            Special Account and Project Account. To expedite disbursements and ensure that project&#13;
funds will be available when needed, the Government will open one Special Account for each executing&#13;
agency (total of 4 Special Accounts) in a conunercial bank acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocation of&#13;
Special Account "A" for BCPA, Special Account "B" for Extension, Special Account "C" for Research&#13;
and Special Account "D" for Livestock will be US$300,000 for each one, representing IDA's anticipated&#13;
share of eligible expenditures for 4 months. IDA would make an initial deposit of $150,000 in each special&#13;
account upon credit effectiveness and once SDR (-check figure-) is disbursed for each component, the&#13;
balance of the authorized allocation would be advanced to the Special Account. Replenishment of the&#13;
Special Accounts would be made on the basis of monthly applications supported by full documentation of&#13;
SOEs as required.&#13;
9.           Initially, all expenditures of less than US$30,000 would be financed directly from the&#13;
Special Accounts and for any expenditure above US$30,000, IDA would accept direct payments. Once the&#13;
full allocation is advanced, this threshold would rise to US$60,000. The Government will open in a&#13;
financial institution a Project Account to cover its counterpart contribution to the project, to be used&#13;
exclusively to meet expenditures under the Program. The Borrower will deposit into the Project Account:&#13;
(a) an initial amount of US$300,000 equivalent in Guinean Francs and (b) the remaining amount of its&#13;
counterpart contributions, US$2.9 million equivalent according to a schedule of payments agreed upon&#13;
between the Borrower and IDA (para. 15). The establishment of this Project Account with an initial&#13;
deposit of US$300,000 equivalent in Guinean Francs will be a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 23).&#13;

C. Accounts and Auditing&#13;
10.          Consolidated project accounts will be established and maintained by each of the executing&#13;
agencies, which have developed the required experience under on-going operations. As soon as possible&#13;
after the end of the financial year, but not later than nine months after its completion, the Government will&#13;
present audit reports of the special accounts and the project accounts with a special opinion on the use of&#13;
the special account and SOEs. The audits will be carried out by an independent auditing firm with&#13;
qualifications and under ternms of reference acceptable to IDA. The audit reports will furnish as part of the&#13;
management letter an opinion on the use of, and procurement methods for IDA-financed incremental&#13;
operating costs. The Government's performance in auditing project accounts has generally been acceptable&#13;
and the Government is in full compliance on other projects, and the quality of the audits has also been&#13;
satisfactory. The contracting of auditors, on multi-year contract, acceptable to IDA, and certification by&#13;
auditors that each project entity's accounting system is operational, is a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA&#13;
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION PLAN AND&#13;
PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
A. Monitoring and Evaluation Plan&#13;
1.           The M&amp;E system would have three components: (a) management information systems&#13;
(MIS) by each executing agency, focusing on annual measurement of outputs in terms of physical&#13;
accomplishments; (b) impact evaluations and beneficiary assessment/feedback; and (c) agricultural sector&#13;
performance analyses. Type (b) and (c) evaluations would be carried out before the midterm review (March&#13;
1998) and at the end of the project, and would be done through technical assistance contracts with local&#13;
university-based or other qualified research groups, and supported under the agricultural policy and&#13;
institutional improvement component. BCPA, in consultation with the other executing agencies, would be&#13;
responsible for initiating and coordinating these evaluations.&#13;
2.            Management Information Systems (MIS).  The MIS would be established within&#13;
SNPRV, IRAG and DNE and would be the overall responsibility of the BCPA. These MIS would embody&#13;
data on financial, physical and personnel inputs, as well as on sub-program outputs, which would be&#13;
evaluated against pre-defined performance indicators. MIS reports would be provided regularly to the&#13;
BCPA, which would disseminate them to the NASP Steering Committee and participating donors, and&#13;
interpret their results for decision makers. The NASP Steering Committee will also be responsible for&#13;
identifying corrective actions required and ensuring that these are implemented by sub-program managers.&#13;
3.           Impact Evaluations and Feedback. The impact of extension and livestock services on&#13;
the intended beneficiaries would be assessed every two years. The main source of information will be from&#13;
a random samnple survey of about 3,000 farm households. The survey, which covers all districts, is&#13;
conducted annually by the Agricultural Statistics Office of MAEF (SNSA). The results of this survey&#13;
would provide the main source of data for quantitative evaluations. Additional questions would be added to&#13;
this survey's questionnaire to elicit mostly qualitative feedback from farmers on their satisfaction of NASP&#13;
services, and constraints they are facing. The data collected will be analyzed by gender and income&#13;
categories. Supplementary impact evaluation surveys will be conducted by experienced investigators to&#13;
verify and supplement the qualitative evaluations. The in-depth analysis of the quantitative survey and the&#13;
impact evaluation will be conducted by independent, local, university-based, qualified research groups&#13;
supported by international consultants. Results of both the quantitative and qualitative evaluations will be&#13;
used to identify improvements that would increase the impact of NASP activities.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
4.            Sector Performance Analysis (see Section B below).  As NASP encompasses an&#13;
important part of the agricultural sector, its impact would be best evaluated though an analysis of the&#13;
overall performance of the sector (Table 1). Thus, a sector performance analysis would be undertaken&#13;
before the mid-term review and at the end of the first phase by the independent research group mentioned&#13;
above. This analysis would consider the impact on the sector of such factors as policy reforms,&#13;
international trade and inflation, besides conventional inputs and weather variables. Furthermore, it would&#13;
assess the relative contributions of different NASP sub-programs to overall sector performance (Tables 2&#13;
to 4). The BCPA and SNSA would be responsible for reviewing methodologies of both the above surveys&#13;
and the sector performance analysis to ensure that they conform with high international standards.&#13;
Special Studies&#13;
5.            Provision is being made for special M&amp;E studies for which need may arise during the&#13;
course of implementation. Inasmuch as these studies may require special data collection efforts such as&#13;
rapid rural surveys, they can be undertaken by the enumerators of SNSA.&#13;
Bank Supervision Input&#13;
6.            Table 5 (Section B) summarizes field supervision needs. These inputs are in addition to&#13;
regular supervision needs for the review of progress reports, procurement actions, supervision report&#13;
preparation and correspondence (which are estimated at 20 staff weeks per year throughout project&#13;
implementation).&#13;
7.            Each Bank supervision mission would: (i) require at least two weeks in the field; (ii)&#13;
require the services of a specialist in project management and implementation and, at least once a year,&#13;
specialists in research, extension and livestock; and (iii) review progress of procurement and civil works,&#13;
financial statements and disbursements, loan covenants, and the implementation of technical assistance and&#13;
training activities. Specialized skill requirements would be added to the missions according to needs&#13;
identified by previous supervision missions and would concentrate on the following: specific technical&#13;
issues in research, extension and livestock; monitoring and evaluation; and agricultural policy analysis and&#13;
special needs of women farmers.&#13;
8.            BCPA would be responsible for coordinating arrangements for supervision missions by the&#13;
Bank and cofinanciers and providing information required by missions. Mission briefings upon arrival and&#13;
wrap-up meetings would be presided by the Secretary General of MAEF or a designated representative.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA&#13;
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Background&#13;
1.           Guinea achieved one of the highest growth rates in agricultural GDP in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa during the past decade. This was essentially due to the liberalization of prices and markets, which&#13;
fbllowed three decades of excessive government control, and improved rural infrastructure. Several&#13;
indicators point to the fact that future growth would be less potent unless concerted efforts are taken now to&#13;
put enhanced agricultural knowledge in the hands of farmers. First, output growth was essentially the&#13;
result of expansion of cultivated area; crop yield remained, at best, constant. As more land is put into&#13;
cultivation at the extensive margin, crop yields will decline further, thereby requiring even more land to&#13;
sustain output growth and exacerbating deforestation concems. Second, the level of awareness and&#13;
adoption of improved cultural practices by Guinea farmers is low as a combined result of low productivity&#13;
of agronomic research and the limited coverage of the national agricultural extension system. (See Figure 1&#13;
for an illustration of the expected effect of the current project on the aggregate agricultural supply&#13;
response).&#13;
2.            Recent economic and sector reviews have highlighted the need for agricultural&#13;
intensification as the most desirable avenue for sustainable agricultural output growth and broad based&#13;
poverty alleviation in Guinea. This entails generation and diffusion of improved crop and animal&#13;
husbandry practices. Thus, the current Country Assistance Strategy (1994) recognizes the need for&#13;
rationalizing the considerable donor assistance to Guinea's agriculture, including restructuring of the IDA&#13;
financed project portfolio, and for a broad review of growth constraints and potentials. More specifically,&#13;
the Policy Framework Paper (1995) calls for support to agricultural services including agronomic research,&#13;
agricultural extension, and animal health services.&#13;
3.            The current project takes due account of the above and fits within the sectoral priorities&#13;
outlined in the Borrower's stated sectoral development strategy contained in the Letter of Agricultural&#13;
Development Policy (LPDA, 1991) and the Agricultural Development Note (NDA, 1995).&#13;
4.            A recent review of public expenditures highlighted the need for reducing the size of the&#13;
public investment program and the scope of the activities of MAEF. Generic problems related to&#13;
counterpart financing are being addressed.&#13;

Intensification and general improvement in crop husbandry as a result of technology generation and its&#13;
diffusion to a large number of farmers under the current project would lead to a downward shift in the&#13;
aggregate supply schedule (Q=f(A)), from the solid to the dotted line. Under this circumstance, the price&#13;
elasticity of supply would be larger since the incremental output with project (AQ*) is larger that the one&#13;
without (AQ) for the same incremental area put to cultivation (AA). (See S. Ghatak and Ingersent:&#13;
Agriculture and Economic DeveloDment (1984), Johns Hopkins, p. 173, for a theoretical treatment). Net&#13;
actual gains from the project are larger than AQ* because the mitigation of environmental cost to the society of&#13;
moving along the "without project" aggregate supply schedule via area expansion alone, without the&#13;
mitigation activities included in the project, is not accounted for.&#13;

Guinea in the past have yielded satisfactory results in terms of broad based productivity increase and&#13;
financial sUstainability. Agricultural extension and applied research undertaken within the context of&#13;
commodity development (filiere) projects traditionally have a high overhead, reach too few farmers, and are&#13;
mono-crop specific. When undertaken within the context of area development projects, the delivery of&#13;
these services loses in professionalism and creates parallel structures with conflicting approaches (a source&#13;
of confusion to farmers). In addition, area development projects, by internally undertaking activities that&#13;
could best be delivered by other (public or private) operators are often sources of inefficiencies due to&#13;
scope diseconomies. The shortcomings of area development projects have been highlighted by OED2; and&#13;
IDA has discontinued financing such projects in Guinea since completion of the Gueckedou Agricultural&#13;
Development Project in 1989. Private extension in Guinea currently does not seem feasible.&#13;
Economic Benefits and Rate of Return.&#13;
6.            Direct economic benefits from this project derive from increased productivity and&#13;
production of a wide range of crops and livestock products. The major food crops are rice (occupying&#13;
about 360,000 ha, or about 45 percent of cultivated land), groundnuts (15 percent) and maize (10 percent).&#13;
Given the large size and composite nature of the current project, the overall assessment of its economic&#13;
viability is based on several criteria: (a) traditional cost-benefit analysis for the livestock component, (b)&#13;
cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness for the extension and research components, and (c) fiscal impact&#13;
analysis of the whole project.&#13;
7.            Livestock Component. Beef and cow milk production make up about 60 percent of the&#13;
total quantifiable benefits of the livestock component. Under the assumption that: (a) the current cattle&#13;
population (1.8 million heads) would grow at a rate of about 1.0 percent in 1996 and 1.35 percent by 2009,&#13;
due to (i) a decline in adult mortality rate from 0.05 in 1996 to 0.04 in 2009, and (ii) an increase in fertility&#13;
rate from 0.55 in 1996 to 0.60 in 2009 based on experience with similar projects; and (b) cow milk&#13;
production would increase by 33 percent between 1996 and 2009; the ERR estimated by DNE would be&#13;
about 30 percent3. An ex-post estimate of the recently completed Livestock Services Rehabilitation Project&#13;
suggests 18 percent4.&#13;
8.            Research and Extension Component. Concerning extension, current crop yields are low&#13;
and over the past five years, 50 percent of farmners have adopted one or more technical messages extended&#13;
by SNPRV. The agricultural extension component will contribute to increasing the adoption of the stock of&#13;

improved crop and animal husbandry practices and to developing and disseminating new agricultural&#13;
technology. Monitoring and evaluation surveys by SNPRV indicate that with existing technology crop&#13;
yields have increased by about 30 percent for farmers having direct contact with the national extension&#13;
service. Ex-post and independent measures of the economic impact of agricultural extension in countries&#13;
with lower agricultural potential than Guinea suggest returns ranging from 70 to 100 percent.&#13;
Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery&#13;
9.            The key question to address is whether or not the Borrower can afford the incremental&#13;
costs generated by the current project. Our analysis indicates that: (i) the pattern of expenditures on&#13;
agricultural services in Guinea is adequate, and (ii) based on current projections of revenue collection and&#13;
overall GDP growth, the current project fits within the country's public expenditure program.  In&#13;
comparing the levels of annual expenditure for services covered under the project and their shares as a&#13;
percentage of the agricultural GDP, one finds that the expenditures pattern is adequate by intemational&#13;
standards.  Annual expenditures for the services covered under the project as a percentage of the&#13;
agricultural GDP in 1994 (US$750 million) are as follows: research - 0.7 percent; extension - 0.8 percent;&#13;
and livestock services - 0.9 percent. These percentages are well within international norms for these kinds&#13;
of public expenditures.  All three components were carefully tailored to the absorptive capacity of the&#13;
respective executing agencies, and the proposed investments constitute least-cost solutions. The project&#13;
support to institutional strengthening, including a much needed restructuring of MAEF and improved&#13;
public expenditure programming and monitoring, would have positive impact on public finances and can be&#13;
expected over time to lower the salary bill. The average annual budget of the agricultural ministry for the&#13;
period 1988-94, in constant 1989 prices, amount to GNF 40 billion, of which GNF 30 billion (75 percent)&#13;
are investment expenditures and GNF 10 billion are recurrent expenditures. Wages expenditures typically&#13;
make up the bulk (97 percent) of recurrent expenditures. In 1994, MAEF spent GNF 17 billion on wages&#13;
and only GNF 300 million for non-wage recurrent expenditures (at current prices). The counterpart&#13;
contribution from Government to the project amounts to about US$44 million, consisting of forgone taxes&#13;
and salaries (in US$ million equivalent) of IRAG (2.6), SNPRV (14.6), DNE (5.2), and BCPA (1.1).&#13;
Based on: (a) latest projections of overall GDP; (b) derived central government revenues and expenditure&#13;
patterns as projected in the recent public expenditure review; (c) constant inter-sectoral shares of public&#13;
expenditures; and (d) constant agricultural services share of total agricultural sector budget; the&#13;
government would have spent about US$92 million during the four-year period 1996-1999. This is slightly&#13;
higher than the cost of the current project over the same time span (see Table 1 for historical and projected&#13;
allocation of public expenditures in the agricultural sector). Thus, the expenditure pattern induced by the&#13;
proposed project not only compares favorably with international norms but its induced recurrent&#13;
expenditures are also likely to be sustained beyond project life.&#13;
10.           There is a downside risk of a shift in inter-sectoral allocation of public expenditures,&#13;
should another sector or civil service salaries receive a more than warranted share of total expenditures.&#13;
Under this scenario there is only a slight margin for decreasing the allocation to agricultural services&#13;
without sacrificing project activities. To mitigate this risk, the agreed annual reviews of the sectoral public&#13;
expenditures would result in rationalization of the PIP and limit waste. The number of projects on the PIP&#13;
has already been reduced by one-half from 133 projects in 1993 level to about 60 projects by end-1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 5 of 13&#13;
With an increasing tendency to focus more on public services activities and selectively recovering the costs&#13;
of their provision, the sectoral demand for public funds would be reduced.&#13;
11.          Further cost savings would be obtained, in terms of unit cost of provision, by integrating&#13;
current and future investments in research, extension, and livestock services. The levels of anticipated&#13;
expenditures on these under the proposed project compare favorably by historical and international&#13;
standards. For agricultural extension, the average capital and current expenditure per-farm family under&#13;
the ongoing operation is estimated at US$18. Under the proposed project, it would be decreasing to US$9,&#13;
owing to extension of the geographical coverage and to the right-sizing of MAEF.&#13;
Assumptions for the Economic Analysis&#13;
12.          Yields:  Incremental yields due to the adoption of simple improved crop husbandry&#13;
methods by farmers in direct contact with the extension is about 30 percent higher than the average crop&#13;
yield obtained by farmers who are not in direct contact with the service. This result is fairly consistent with&#13;
the Burkina Faso extension impact studys.&#13;
12.          Extension coverage: The extension service is currently reaching about 30 percent of farm&#13;
families. It is expected to reach about 50 percent by the year 2000 under the current project.&#13;

13.          Adoption rate: Overall awareness of simple messages is low, except for farmers who have&#13;
been exposed to the extension service. Within the latter group, it is estimated that about 50 percent have&#13;
fully adopted the technical messages extended by SNPRV. The adoption rate varies by theme and by crop,&#13;
ranging from more than 70 percent for such messages as setting up nurseries for low-land rice and&#13;
introduction of new maize varieties, to about 20 percent or less for plant spacing in oilseed cultivation. (See&#13;

15.            Major crops: The area planted with rice, small millet, groundnut, maize, and cassava&#13;
accounts for nearly ninety percent of the total cultivated area of Guinea. Coffee cultivation is confined to&#13;
the forest region, Guinee Forestiere.&#13;
16.           Prices: Producer prices for all crops are converted into their import parity equivalents.&#13;
International prices are derived from Bank's projections by the Commodity Policy and Analysis Unit.&#13;
17.           Markets: All crops are assumed to be domestically consumed. The impact of the project&#13;
on export crops (in Guinee Maritime, for fruits and vegetable, and Guin6e Forestiere, for coffee) would be&#13;
relatively minor, given that most technical messages extended to farmers pertain to food crops.&#13;
18.           Net incremental margins: Under the assumptions made above, net incremental returns at&#13;
the end of PY4 are anticipated to amount to about US$38 million.&#13;
19.           Economic costs: The economic cost of transferring the technical messages to farners&#13;
under the current project includes not only extension but also agronomic research. The latter cost is lagged&#13;
by four years to account for the time it takes for a research result to translate into a technical message to be&#13;
extended. Project costs are net of taxes.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return&#13;
20.           Several ex-post and quantitative studies show that research and extension projects are&#13;
highly profitable, with economic rate of return (ERR) in excess of 40 percent. (Evenson). More recently,&#13;
two such studies found ex-post ERR, based on primary survey data, in excess of 100 percent for Kenya6&#13;
and 70 percent for Burkina Faso7.&#13;
21.           The estimated economic internal rate of return is 46 percent; it is in the range of similar&#13;
estimates found elsewhere for research and extension operations. Table 3 below summarizes the stream&#13;
and benefits and costs; detailed derivations of these streams are included in Annex Table 1.&#13;

Rate of Return&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
22.           The economic rate of return is tested against several scenarios of variations in the levels of&#13;
key variables affecting benefits and costs. From the benefits side, crop yields and producers' prices were&#13;
made to increase and decrease from 10 to 50 percent. The same variations are applied to the cost stream.&#13;
The results included in Table 3b show that the ERR is fairly robust. In effect, the ERR would fall below&#13;
10 percent only in the event of a concomitant 50 percent decline in revenue and 20 percent increase in cost.&#13;
23.           Estimated switching values (at an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent) suggest that to&#13;
break even, benefits would have to decrease by 53 percent or costs to increase by 115 percent. The&#13;
likelihood of each occurrence is small, based on experience with the recently completed predecessor&#13;
projects in Guinea and with similar projects in other Sub-Saharan African countries. The basket of&#13;
commodities on which the benefits are based is diversified and declines in prices of major magnitude for the&#13;
commodities concerned, during the past four decades were infrequent (see para 24).&#13;

24.           Probabilities of occurrence of each scenario are used to weigh the expected streams of&#13;
benefits. The same weighing is applied to the costs and delays in project start. Probabilities of occurrence&#13;
are based on the historical frequencies of major variations in benefit or cost factors. For instance, during&#13;
the period 1950-91, the price of rice declined, from one year to the next 21 times and increased 20 times.&#13;
Major yearly declines of at least 10 percent occurred nine times and those of at least 20 percent occurred&#13;
four times during the same period.  The maximum  year-to-year decline was 39 percent in 1982.&#13;
Probabilities for the delays in implementation are based on Africa-wide experience of Bank financed&#13;
projects and Guinea's recent experience in providing counterpart financing and timely fulfilling of&#13;
effectiveness conditions. From this experience, delays in counterpart funds are likely and will lead to lags&#13;
in implementation. Under this scenario, the ERR is still robust at 20 percent with a three-year lag in&#13;
project benefits.&#13;

25.               Four commodities make up the bulk of the prospective benefits: rice, 35 percent; cassava,&#13;
31 percent; groundnut, 23 percent; and maize, 11 percent. Project benefits will depend on the projected&#13;
variations in the prices of these commnodities. According to the Bank's projections, there is a 70 percent&#13;
probability that the price of rice will fall within the range 40 percent to +30 percent around the baseline&#13;
forecast of US$255/t in 1997; for groundnut, the lower and upper bounds are -33 percent and +40 percent;&#13;
and for maize, -31 percent and +25 percent around the respective baseline forecasts. (There is no similar&#13;
probability forecast for cassava). Combining the benefit share and the price risks associated with each&#13;
commodity, one can conclude that there is a 70 percent probability that project total benefits would fall&#13;
within the range -14 percent (i.e, 0.40 times -0.33) to + 10.5 percent (i.e, 0.35 times 0.30) around the base&#13;
line total benefits as a result of rice price; 8 percent around the base line as a result of groundnut price and&#13;
only 3 percent as a result of maize price. Even under this conservative scenario (since, actually, the joint&#13;
probability of the simultaneous decrease in the price of all the commodities, is much less than 15 percent --&#13;
the lower tail of the 70 percent probability distribution) the ERR will be no less than 30 percent (in the&#13;
range 35 to 41 percent in Table 4b).&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA&#13;
MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE&#13;
LIVESTOCK AND FORESTS&#13;
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR POLICY NOTE&#13;
The agricultural policy pursued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry constitutes&#13;
the sectoral application of the speech delivered on December 22, 1985 by the Chief of State, which laid out&#13;
the broad economic outlines of post-revolutionary Guinea. Guinea officially rallied at that time to the&#13;
cause of market-based economics and launched an economic and financial recovery program (the&#13;
Programme de Redressement Economique et Financier, or PREF) based on the State's withdrawal from&#13;
production and marketing activities and the promotion of private initiative.&#13;
These guidelines served as the basis for a policy document prepared in close collaboration with the&#13;
international commnunity and adopted in December 1991. The objective was to revitalize a sector affecting&#13;
80% of the Guinean population and to turn it into one of the motors of economic growth in a country whose&#13;
great productive potential was widely recognized. This document, the Policy Letter on Agricultural&#13;
Development (Lettre de politque de developpement agricole - LPDA) emphasized four priorities:&#13;
-- promotion of food security;&#13;
= rehabilitation of export crops;&#13;
= natural resource conservation in order to preserve the productive base;&#13;
-- creation of conditions conducive to the emergence of a private sector.&#13;
Four years after the adoption of this policy, it is time to take stock , to reflect on its application and&#13;
its weaknesses, and to develop some perspective.  Such an exercise is all the more opportune since the&#13;
global context has changed markedly, macroeconomic imbalances persist at the national level, and a certain&#13;
number of development operations initiated in the late 1980s are drawing to a close. Guinea needs to&#13;
redefine, vis-a-vis its development partners, the framework within which it intends to implement its public&#13;
investment program in support of sustainable development.&#13;
This exercise has caused the government to ask itself, in particular, whether its strategies are&#13;
relevant and whether its institutional set-up is geared to the goals that the country has set for itself.&#13;
Overall, the results of this first decade of rehabilitation of Guinean agriculture have been quite&#13;
positive. Since 1991, growth in the agricultural sector has exceeded that of the gross domestic product&#13;
(GDP): 2.9% in 1991; 4.7% in 1992, 5.0% in 1993 and 5.1% in 1994. This acceleration in the sector's&#13;
growth indicates the validity of the policy and investment program being pursued to support this growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

These growth rates, which are higher than those of many African countries, were accentuated by the&#13;
previous lag accumulated by Guinea under the first republic. Henceforth, this growth will need to be&#13;
supported through a more systematic identification of pockets of growth, and producers and economic&#13;
actors will need to be mobilized around such pockets.&#13;
Redefining the role of the State&#13;
Tailoring the State's role to the demands of the LPDA is one of the primary concems of the&#13;
department in charge of agriculture. The task will be to transform the managerial administration of a&#13;
bloated public sector under the first republic into a development-oriented administration capable of defining&#13;
subsectoral priorities, defining and implementing support programs and keeping pace with the growing&#13;
power of a private sector that efficiently seizes upon development opportunities offered by the agricultural&#13;
sector, in domestic as well as export markets.&#13;
At the administrative level within the Ministry, a wide-ranging restructuring effort has been&#13;
undertaken with outside help, most notably from the World Bank. A certain number of national&#13;
directorates and their decentralized services are now operational, and have the appropriate mandates and&#13;
staffing levels. The directorates in question are the National Livestock Directorate (Direction Nationale de&#13;
1'elevage - DNE), the National Rural Promotion and Extension Services (Service national de promotion&#13;
rurale et de vulgarisation - SNPRV), the Guinean Agronomic Research Institute (Institut de recherche&#13;
agronomique de Guinge- INAG), the Bureau for Coordination of Agricultural Policy (Bureau de&#13;
coordination de la politique agricole - BCPA). The fact that these directorates have been restructured&#13;
does no preclude a quest for greater efficiency, through training efforts and eventual adjustments at the&#13;
managerial level.&#13;
The National Water Supply Service (Service national d 'amenagement des points d 'eau - SNAPE)&#13;
is considered one of the most effective village water supply entities in Africa. This assessment was recently&#13;
confirmed by a joint evaluation commissioned last June by the European Union and the French&#13;
Cooperation. Village water supply programs are ahead of schedule: the 1995 goal of 6,500 water points&#13;
was achieved in mid-1994. The SNAPE has gradually withdrawn from force account works and now&#13;
oversees, as implementing and executing ag-,ncy, works delegated to contractors. This divestiture will&#13;
continue through the creation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) specialized in well-digging and the&#13;
improvement of springs, which should make it possible to reduce SNAPE's contractual staff by half.&#13;
The process is not as far along for other structures, which are, however, no less important for the&#13;
success of actions undertaken by the directorate. Indeed, the debate is ongoing regarding the organization&#13;
of our services in a number of areas. Our reflection will continue, especially in the following areas:&#13;
-- the direction our efforts should take to promote food security and revitalize exports. Experience&#13;
indicates that our teams need strengthening in this area in order to foster a more sustained production&#13;
dynamic;&#13;
-- coordination of field interventions (i.e., roles to be played by the prefecture-level directors for&#13;
rural development and environment (DPDRE) and by the regional inspection services) in a context of&#13;
greater decentralization of government intervention;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

-- protection of food consumers (i.e., development and implementation of consumer fraud&#13;
regulations). This is an interministerial matter, since it concerns consumers' health as well as the trade&#13;
sector;&#13;
-- implementation of a policy on plant disease prevention geared to the demands of a liberal&#13;
economy through the creation of a network of private operators and specialized groups;&#13;
--management of protected forests and national parks, and protection and conservation of natural&#13;
resources that do not enjoy official protected status.  The results of pilot projects in village land&#13;
management, reforestation and brush fire prevention will be used to update our policy concerning the&#13;
rational management of our natural resources. We already know that the State and decentralized local&#13;
authorities will need to play a primary role in an area where individual initiative and the desire for&#13;
immediate gain are often at odds with medium and long-term environmental interests. The example of the&#13;
mangrove area, which is under strong demographic pressure, is one indication that excessive liberalization&#13;
of access to a resource can have irreversible consequences;&#13;
*- implementation of the land tenure code which recognizes land ownership and which will have to&#13;
make allowances for the traditional laws that still prevail on almost all rural lands. The development of a&#13;
rural land tenure plan, begun with the support of the World Bank, will be the MAEF's preferred tool in this&#13;
area;&#13;
-- development and implementation of a sustainable policy on rural roads maintenance, which can&#13;
be progressively transferred to local communities and user associations. In this connection, we intend to tie&#13;
the implementation of new investment tranches in a given region to the beneficiaries' capacity to assume&#13;
responsibility for all or part of the maintenance;&#13;
-- promotion of private operators in areas were investment opportunities exist: i.e., in modem&#13;
commercial agriculture and stockraising, input distribution, small and medium-sized contractors, service&#13;
provision (topography, consulting, training, accounting, etc.);&#13;
--training of managers in the department and in the private sector. Indeed, these structures are only&#13;
as good as the people staffing them and the programs that they implement.&#13;
In all these areas of government intervention, we will continue to weigh the best means of achieving&#13;
our objectives. The department is already planning to reassign some of the staff of the five directorates for&#13;
community rural development and environment for Conakry to the interior of the country, and particularly&#13;
those agents charged with livestock and agroprocessing.  The redeployments resulting from  this&#13;
restructuring will need to be accompanied by human resource training programs to enable staff to take on&#13;
the new tasks entrusted to them. However, the posts that will be subject to redefinition as regards their&#13;
location, mandates and skill requirements will not necessarily correspond to the profiles of the agents&#13;
already in post, nor will they necessarily be in line with their professional and personal objectives.&#13;
The management of the ministry's staff is inseparable from the national policy on the&#13;
management of administrative personnel, for which the Ministries of Reform, Plan and Finance and of the&#13;
department concerned are primarily responsible. MAEF's initiatives in this area will therefore be pursued&#13;
in close cooperation with these ministerial departments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
In this connection, the MAEF has drawn up an inventory and computerized roster of personnel..&#13;
The MAEF is practically the only ministry in the country to have such a high-tech tool. This mechanism&#13;
will make it possible to better know and evaluate the capacities of departmental personnel. It will also&#13;
improve the management of personnel assignments and ensure that positions are indeed filled.&#13;
In addition, given the concem with streamlining staff and minimizing the social consequences, the&#13;
ministry estimates that a certain proportion of the department's employees could be inclined to leave civil&#13;
service if the conditions of their departure and insertion into the private sector were sufficiently attractive.&#13;
For this reason, the MAEF will carry out a study, starting in early 1996, with the following objectives:&#13;
- identify, by means of a survey, the target population of candidates for voluntary departure;&#13;
- detem-ine how the administration can facilitate these departures;&#13;
- examine the financial feasibility of the operation;&#13;
- set up a two-year pilot project ( 1997-98) which, subject to an evaluation, could be extended.&#13;
In order the ensure the greatest chance of success and avoid the errors committed in the past,&#13;
operations carried out in support of privatization by the Bureau d'aide a la reconversion des&#13;
fonctionnaires (BARAF), the Projet integre de developpement des entreprises (PRIDE) and the OIC will&#13;
be analyzed in the framework of this study with a view to deriving the relevant lessons. The following&#13;
calendar is proposed for this operation:&#13;
-January 1996 : drafting of terms of reference (first draft to be presented at negotiations)&#13;
-February 1996: choice of survey team members and establishment of the team&#13;
- March-August 1996: implementation of the survey&#13;
- September 1996: drawing up dossier on feasibility&#13;
- October-December 1996: setting up logistics for implementation of pilot project and choice of&#13;
candidates for same&#13;
-January 1997: start-up of two-year project&#13;
-November-December 1998: evaluation of project with a view to its extension.&#13;
Improving project effectiveness&#13;
The quest for efficiency in the department's interventions is behind an important effort aimed at&#13;
reformulating and reorganizing regional development projects. This work began with the projects launched&#13;
towards the end of the first republic and at the beginning of the second republic. At issue were the Projet&#13;
Agricole de Gueckedou (PAG), the Projet d'amenagement de la plaine de Monchon, the Operation de&#13;
developpement rural integre de Kouroussa (ODRIK), the Projet de rehabilitation agricole dans le Foutah&#13;
Djallon (PRAFD), the Projet agricole de Kolente (PAK) and the Projet de developpement rural de Siguiri&#13;
&#13;

2 (PSRS2). The project management units had been handling the following activities directly: extension,&#13;
infrastructure work, input supply and distribution, credit distribution, seed production, research, and&#13;
agricultural water supply. These units have been streamlined and the implementation of the various&#13;
components has been handed over to specialized operators (SNPRV for extension, IRAG for research,&#13;
SMEs and ONGs.) It was in this context that the SMEs were set up and staffed with managers and&#13;
employees who had previously been working within the projects. The SMEs include the following: la&#13;
Guineenne de maintenance et de travaux publics (GMTP), la Guin&amp;enne de travaux et d 'entretien routier&#13;
(GUITER) and the Societe de production et de commercialisation d'intrants agricoles (SPCIA). Over&#13;
two hundred people were reassigned in the wake of these restructurings. As for the new rural development&#13;
projects, they are henceforth managed by streamlined structures that offer support to public, private or&#13;
professional operators (depending on the type of activity) who will then be able to ensure the sustainability&#13;
of results achieved under those projects.&#13;
Public expenditure in the agricultural sector&#13;
This issue was discussed extensively in a 1995 World Bank study of public expenditures in&#13;
Guinea's agricultural sector. The MAEF is grateful for the study's contribution to the Government's&#13;
reflections in this area.&#13;
The study notes that the portion of the investment budget devoted to the agricultural sector (13.0%&#13;
for the 1988-94 period) is one of the highest among developing countries undergoing an adjustment process&#13;
(the average being 7.0% for the 1984-88 period). This is in keeping with government priorities. The study&#13;
also notes the great weight (over 20% of expenditures) given in the budget to rural infrastructures and&#13;
especially to rural roads, whereas in other countries these activities often come under the heading of public&#13;
works. This situation is the result of a deliberate desire on the part of the Guinean government to closely&#13;
link the programming and implementation of rural roads to other agricultural development priorities.&#13;
According to our calculations, the impact of rural roads in terms of transport costs for goods and&#13;
passengers (a 30 to 70% drop in costs) and increased traffic (an increase of up to 1,000%) is considerable.&#13;
The MAEF shares certain concerns expressed in the study, especially regarding the need to boost&#13;
the performance of the public investment program, cost recovery and the inclusion of recurrent&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
Improving the guality of the Public Investment Program (PIP)&#13;
The improvement of the MAEF's project portfolio implies the continuation of efforts already begun&#13;
at the programming and evaluation level. The Bureau de coordination de la politique Agricole (BCPA)&#13;
now possesses a computerized data base on all the projects implemented under the Ministry's supervision.&#13;
Selection criteria will be progressively refined in order to ensure that action undertaken are in&#13;
keeping with agreed-upon sectoral objectives and priorities. The "tools" of evaluation will be progressively&#13;
refined. It should be noted in this regard that the BCPA has been involved with the SIRPAO program&#13;
(Simulation interregionale des politiques agricoles en Afrique de I 'Ouest), and that it should soon be able&#13;
to exploit the program's possibilities for its own use.&#13;
Special attention will need to be given to a realistic evaluation of recurrent costs engendered by&#13;
activities undertaken in the framework of the PIP, and to the assumption of those costs by beneficiaries, the&#13;
&#13;

State or local authorities. The constraints weighing on public finances are causing the departmnent to&#13;
concern itself more with this question. Interministerial cooperation would be required to deal with the issue.&#13;
Cost recovery and the financing of recurrent costs&#13;
Maintenance costs for watering holes are now entirely borne by the management committees&#13;
created and monitored by the SNAPE in conjunction with the implementation of investment programs.&#13;
A similar procedure will be used for rural roads programs. This will require that such roads first&#13;
be classified as "belonging" to the local authorities that will be entrusted with their maintenance. The&#13;
maintenance costs of the network, which are estimated at about US$ 10 million at full development, will be&#13;
assumed jointly by the State (in the form of a roads fund), prefecture budgets (for the regional network),&#13;
rural development communities (for community road networks) and residents' groups (in the case of&#13;
terminal roads.)&#13;
In subsectors that generate significant value-added (fruits and vegetables, industrial crops), we are&#13;
seeing a gradual increase in the degree of autonomous financing of the cost of services (such as supply,&#13;
collection and technical support) that are performed collectively by professional organizations (coffee,&#13;
onions and potatoes, cotton). In the case of industrial crops (cotton, rubber, palm oil), the objective&#13;
(already partially achieved) would be for operating costs to be completely supported by production and&#13;
processing activities.&#13;
Concerning agricultural and veterinary inputs, cost recovery has become the rule, and this has&#13;
allowed the emergence of private operators or associations. Subsidies are ad hoc and limited in time: they&#13;
consist either of investment incentives (agricultural water supply installations, storage facilities, animal&#13;
traction equipment, creation of permanent plantations), incentives to use certain inputs during the learning&#13;
phase (insecticides for cotton, fertilizers for vegetable crops), or subsidies linked to public health measures&#13;
(obligatory vaccinations against certain diseases).&#13;
Studies will be carried out with a view to broadening the range of MAEF services likely to generate&#13;
revenues. As an example, one can cite the implementation of the rural land tenure plan. Given the interest&#13;
manifested by land owners affected by the Pilot Rural Land Tenure Operation, we are inclined to give&#13;
favorable consideration to the possibility of helping to finance its expansion.  This assumes the&#13;
standardization of intervention costs (land tenure surveys, topographic mapping).  Other services&#13;
(meteorology, documentation) could also be offered on a charge-back basis, at least in part. The studies&#13;
will include negotiations with the Ministry of Finance to determine how to proceed in accordance with the&#13;
rules of public finance.&#13;
Conceming the State budget, one is forced to acknowledge that the MAEF's budget under Title II&#13;
(i.e., operations) is, at 533 million Guinean francs for 1996, abnorrnally small. Such a budgetary envelope&#13;
seems absurd considering the department's activities. One should note, however, that the operating costs of&#13;
certain services directly involved in the implementation of agricultural projects are incorporated into the&#13;
investment budget under the category of the State's contribution.  Tlis anomaly will need to be&#13;
progressively corrected once we have recovered a greater capacity for self-financing of our activities. This&#13;
issue is outside the purview of the MAEF, however, and will need to be examined in the context of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

periodic consultations that Guinea has maintained with the international institutions since it has been&#13;
undergoing structural adjustment.&#13;
The department also noted with pleasure the World Bank's efforts to cover a substantial portion of&#13;
the operating costs of services considered essential for the rehabilitation of agricultural production (e.g.,&#13;
extension, livestock services and agronomic research.)&#13;
Distribution of inputs and seeds&#13;
The department aims to establish an efficient network of private and associative importers and&#13;
distributors of inputs who are capable of satisfying the growing demand on the part of producers.&#13;
However, since the demand among creditworthy takers (6,000 - 7,000 tons of fertilizers per year) is still&#13;
weak, it is difficult to develop a critical mass of activity that could interest the private sector.&#13;
Regarding food crop inputs (in this case 2,000 tons of fertilizer per year) financed by the Japanese&#13;
Cooperation under the GATT agreements (KR2) , the department (DNA) is currently in charge of their&#13;
distribution. DNA is concerned with the judicious use of these inputs for the benefit of small farmers. It&#13;
has progressively withdrawn from retail distribution because of the logistical problems that that created,&#13;
and now relies on such intermediaries as the cotton projects and the RC2 project (Coffee Rehabilitation),&#13;
professional organizations and, increasingly, on specialized private distributors who are willing to commit&#13;
themselves on a long term basis to the creation of a network of sales outlets. From now on, DNA will serve&#13;
as an interface between distributors and outside suppliers, seeking at the same time to ensure good&#13;
geographic coverage of input distribution and negotiating sales agreements so that retail prices remain&#13;
compatible with the objectives of agricultural intensification. DNA will centralize information on the input&#13;
market and its spatial distribution and will spearhead a pro-active policy of developing private and&#13;
associative operators.&#13;
In the area of seed production, the World Bank-supported National Seed Project did not achieve&#13;
the objective of creating a viable private sector for seed production and distribution. The use of improved&#13;
seed increased significantly, however, during the phase of preparation for privatization (1993-95) and now&#13;
stands at over 200 tons of cereal and groundnut seed. Studies will be pursued so that seed processing&#13;
centers can continue to develop and be progressively privatized, and so that seed producers can organize&#13;
themselves into cooperatives. We will endeavor to encourage synergy among the structures involved in&#13;
input distribution.&#13;
This reflection will be broadened to include livestock inputs, which are still largely dependent upon&#13;
public operators such as the Centrale d'approvisionnement vetc1rinaire (CAVET) and the Atelier de&#13;
pierres a lcher (APILEC).&#13;
Updating the Agricultural Development Policy Letter (LPDA)&#13;
An update of the LPDA is planned in the course of 1996 to take into account the desired changes in&#13;
development priorities that are required by the shifting national and international situation and the resulting&#13;
adjustments in policies and investment programns. This exercise will be based on a review of agricultural&#13;
&#13;

projects that will allow us to better evaluate their impact and contribution to sectoral objectives. It will be&#13;
conducted in close collaboration with Guinea's agricultural development partners.&#13;
The work thus undertaken will complement the reflection now underway on the previously&#13;
mentioned restructuring of the DNA.&#13;
It will also make it possible to consolidate achievements in the area of natural resource&#13;
management strategies. One aim, among others, will be to carry out complementary studies aimed at&#13;
evaluating the economic importance of certain resources, the cost of their degradation and the benefits&#13;
associated with investing in their management and conservation. The resources in question are essentially&#13;
forests (including mangrove swamps in the mangrove areas) and lands earmarked for agricultural and&#13;
pastoral activities.&#13;
The update of the LPDA will also be an opportunity for the Ministry to reflect on the role it must&#13;
play in managing the wood subsector: regulatory control of exploitation, issuance of cutting permits,&#13;
appropriateness of tax regimes, promotion of professionals, and evaluation of the impact on resources.&#13;
These studies will allow us to better identify the investments needed to ensure the sustainable&#13;
management of these resources and to define the mandate and organization of services entrusted with&#13;
implementing this policy. It will be necessary, in particular, to reexamine the respective mandates of the&#13;
DNFF, the Office Guineen du Bois (OGUIB), and of structures set up within the framework of natural&#13;
resource management projects ("watershed" and "village lands" projects). Any contribution that SNPRV&#13;
can make to the dissemination of technical messages linked to rational resource management (prevention of&#13;
brush fires, individual and collective tree planting, agroforestry) will be incorporated into this reflection.&#13;
Technical assistance&#13;
During the period from 1984 to 1994, the MAEF relied to a great extent on external technical&#13;
assistance for help with its own restructuring process and with implementing its investment plan.&#13;
Retrospective evaluations (by BSD, PAG, etc.) have shown that this technical assistance was not always&#13;
wisely recruited and utilized. Given the high cost of this technical assistance, the department will continue&#13;
efforts to streamline its use.&#13;
Technical assistance on a grant basis is the subject of periodic negotiations with the relevant&#13;
donors. As for technical assistance in the context of loans, it will gradually be cut back. Priority will be&#13;
given to short term consultancies, ad hoc missions or periodic support missions.&#13;
Support to the private sector&#13;
In i'mplementing its agricultural policy, the MAEF tries to rely as much as possible on private&#13;
initiative. This is, of course, the case with the promotion of traditional farms, which constitute the basis of&#13;
production. Even for industrial crops (cotton, rubber, oil palm), family farms play a preponderant role.&#13;
This policy orientation extends into the area of help to professional organizations established by producers.&#13;
As we have seen, such organizations can become veritable economic operators, especially in the area of&#13;
input supply and product marketing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 9 of 9&#13;
This support to the private sector also manifests itself at the level of small and medium enterprises&#13;
in the rural works sector. The almost systematic execution of works by contractors has created a vein&#13;
opportunity for the private sector, which has translated into the creation of 115 SMEs that have received&#13;
training from MAEF through the UniIe Mobile Ecole de Mamou and that performed US$ 3 million worth&#13;
of work in 1994.&#13;
As regards livestock, fifteen private veterinarians have settled in as clinicians (running clinics&#13;
formerly belonging to the livestock service and that have been ceded to them), in addition to eight private&#13;
veterinarians who work alongside pharmacists to handle the supply of veterinary products in their zones.&#13;
The plan is to have them participate in the obligatory vaccination programs and to involve them in&#13;
programs promoting animal traction.&#13;
In the area of rural credit, the process initiated through the rural and mutual credit networks is&#13;
aimed at creating private-style federated structures. The process is already well underway with rural&#13;
credit. Legislative and regulatory texts were approved by the relevant authorities in mid-1995. The&#13;
structures (a foundation, a rural credit bank and local caisses) should be operational by mid-1996. The&#13;
process is also moving along for mutual credit, and should be finalized before the end of 1996.&#13;
The DNA also has a great stake in the promotion of modern agriculture. Tools are in place for this&#13;
purpose (e.g., lines of credit for stockraising, a USAID-financed Agricultural Investment and Marketing&#13;
Project and a World Bank-financed Agricultural Exports Promotion Project.) These interventions are&#13;
beginning to bear fruit.&#13;
Efforts made by the Guinean government and by the DNA to mobilize international investors are&#13;
beginning to yield promising results. The code of economic activity, issued in late 1992, the investment&#13;
code, the land tenure code published in April 1992, the liberalization of exchange rates, the democratization&#13;
process, etc., are all signs attesting to the desire to attract outside investment. Many investors have shown&#13;
an interest in Guinea and some have begun to undertake concrete operations. The MAEF will continue, in&#13;
collaboration with other departments, to improve the general business climate in order to foster private&#13;
foreign investment in agriculture.&#13;
In conclusion, and as a certain number of indicators prove, Guinean agriculture is on the road to&#13;
recovery. The results obtained are promising, but remain fragile. We must consolidate achievements by&#13;
strengthening field teams so that they can improve their performance. We are confident that the upgrading&#13;
of personnel through more appropriate training, the development of synergy between the department's&#13;
various interventions, improved collaboration between ministries and with our development partners will&#13;
make it possible for us to attain our objectives of food security, rehabilitation of exports and rational&#13;
resource management which are the cornerstones of our agricultural policy.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the National
            Agricultural Services Project is to improve nationwide
            agricultural productivity and production, incomes of farmers
            and food security. The project comprises the following
            components: (a) institutional capacity building in the
            Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry (MAEF) to
