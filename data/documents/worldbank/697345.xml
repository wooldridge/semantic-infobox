TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower              Republic of Indonesia&#13;
Beneficiary           PT. Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TELKOM)&#13;
Ministry of Tourism, Posts and Telecommunications (MTPT)&#13;
Amount                $325.0 million equivalent&#13;
Terms                 Twenty years including a five-year grace period at the Bank's standard&#13;
variable rate.&#13;
On-lending Terms      The proceeds of the loan, except $8.0 million for technical assistance to the&#13;
Government of Indonesia (GOI), will be on-lent from the GOI to TELKOM&#13;
for 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years; the subsidiary loan will be&#13;
denominated in equivalent US dollars and the on-lending rate will be under the&#13;
same terms as the Bank's loan plus 0.5 percent per annum. TELKOM will&#13;
bear the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
and Description   :  The project supports, and is predicated on a comprehensive reform program&#13;
for the  telecommunications sector.  The reform  is based on three key&#13;
elements: entry of world class operators, competition in all segments of the&#13;
sector, and reorganization of the established public telecommunications&#13;
service provider. The proposed project has a policy component, an investment&#13;
component, and a technical assistance component.&#13;
The policy component of the project, fully financed by the Bank, entails (a)&#13;
reviewing and developing as appropriate the telecommunications legal and&#13;
regulatory environment to ensure effective entry of private investors and&#13;
operators in the telecommunications sector;  (b) strengthening MTPT's&#13;
capability to manage regulatory issues including monitoring and evaluating&#13;
operators' performance in the emerging multi-operator environment;  (c)&#13;
reviewing the management and allocation of radio frequency spectrum to&#13;
ensure efficient use of the spectrum and appropriate use of modem&#13;
technology; and (d) developing a plan for the provision of rural telephone&#13;
services on a commercial basis.&#13;
The investment component, partly financed by the Bank and to be&#13;
implemented over three years (1995-97), will support further improvements in&#13;
quality of service and network modernization. It includes: (a) installation of&#13;
local and inter-exchange networks based on the latest technology to add one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
vi&#13;
million telephone lines and effectively utilize the switching capacity in Jakarta&#13;
and Surabaya; (b) installation of a second fiber optic back-bone system&#13;
between Jakarta and Surabaya; (c) installation of submarine optical fiber cable&#13;
transmission systems to upgrade transmission facilities to Kalimantan and&#13;
Sulawesi; and (d) enhancement of information systems to improve&#13;
TELKOM's business processes.&#13;
The technical assistance component, fully financed by TELKOM supports: (a)&#13;
strengthening the project implementation, marketing, customer services and&#13;
managerial capacities of TELKOM through the provision of specialized&#13;
marketing and managerial services; and (b) improving TELKOM's managerial&#13;
capabilities through the implementation of its ongoing restructuring program.&#13;
The project complements and supports the JOS operations through which&#13;
private investors and operators will install a minimum of two million&#13;
additional telephone lines and operate both the new and existing network in&#13;
the regions outside Jakarta and Surabaya under stringent performance&#13;
requirements. As a result of these and other initiatives, Indonesia's telephone&#13;
density would be increased from about 1.26 in 1994 to 3.5 per 100 inhabitants&#13;
at the end of REPELITA VI in 1999.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
and Risks           Project Benefits: The proposed project will support the implementation of an&#13;
ongoing reform agenda with profound effect on market structure, service&#13;
coverage and regulatory environment, all aimed at bringing the performance of&#13;
the Indonesian telecommunications sector to international competitive levels.&#13;
The licensing of five consortia, each tied to a world-class telecommunications&#13;
operator, to provide local telephone services in five regions of Indonesia will&#13;
generate dynamic effects towards increasing competition in various market&#13;
segments and developing an effective regulatory environment. The award of&#13;
these licenses to the private sector through a transparent and competitive&#13;
bidding process, the establishment of clearly defined performance targets for&#13;
service quality throughout the country and the establishment of effective&#13;
performance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms will not only contribute&#13;
to the development of high quality low cost telecommunication systems&#13;
throughout Indonesia, but also establish a framework approach as precedent&#13;
for emulation in other Indonesian infrastructure sectors.  Likewise, other&#13;
elements of the reform agenda, i.e. the review of the Telecommunications&#13;
Law, planned partial privatization of TELKOM, and the development of pilot&#13;
projects for improved delivery of rural telephone services, will each contribute&#13;
to improved sector performance. Taken together, these various elements of&#13;
reform will lead to a substantially increased role for the private sector, a more&#13;
competitive TELKOM and the evolution of a multi-operator environment.&#13;
Project Risks. Based on the past successful experience with Bank projects, the&#13;
implementation of the physical components by TELKOM and achievement of&#13;
the benefits associated with it essentially does not present any significant risks.&#13;
However, there are risks in the implementation of the reform program in&#13;
respect of: (a) transparency of selection and award process of the JOS; and (b)&#13;
incentives for efficiency improvements, achievement of performance targets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
vii&#13;
and sharing benefits with customers. The quality of the requests for proposals&#13;
(RFP), issued to 12 pre-qualified consortia, and the process to respond to&#13;
bidders' questions and opening of bids (on March 21, 1995) in the presence of&#13;
representatives of all bidders, have demonstrated MTPT's commitment to a&#13;
transparent selection and award process. Similarly, the GOI has signaled in&#13;
the clarification to the RFP that the GOI overriding objective in proceeding&#13;
with the JOS is to bring the provision of telecommunications services in all&#13;
parts of Indonesia up to internationally competitive levels in terms of range of&#13;
services, availability, quality, and price. Thus, the GOI has linked explicitly&#13;
the justification of reform to performance improvements and customer&#13;
benefits. Specifically, in reviewing tariff proposals from JOS operators, the&#13;
GOI will eschew a "cost-plus" approach by using the highest efficiency&#13;
performance in the sector in Indonesia and in other competitor countries in the&#13;
region as benchmarks.&#13;

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJFCT&#13;
I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR&#13;
A. Sector Overview&#13;
Performance Assessment&#13;
1.1       Where does Indonesia  stand?   Indonesia's record  of accomplishmenits  in the&#13;
telecommunications sector during 1988-94 is impressive. Annual investment increased from about $340&#13;
million to about $1 billion; investment costs per new line have dropped from US $3,000 to US $1,200:&#13;
the rate of network expansion has increased from 8 percent per annum to over 20 percent per annum; the&#13;
rate of long-distance call completion improved from 19 percent to 36 percent, and labor productivity&#13;
improved from 20 to 50 lines per employee. Nevertheless, much remains to be done for the sector to&#13;
meet the vigorous growth in demand for telecommunications and informatics services and to match the&#13;
performance standards of Indonesia's best performing regional competitors (Table 1.1). Demand for&#13;
telephones still exceeds supply; sophisticated telecommunications services - which are needed for&#13;
businesses to compete in the global market place - are in their infancy; the efficiency of operations&#13;
remains low; and service quality and reliability are below that of well dimensioned networks.&#13;

1.2        Regional Distribution.  In 1994, the access to telephone service in Indonesia was low at&#13;
around 1.26 telephone lines per 100 inhabitants. Jakarta, with only about 8 percent of Indonesia's&#13;
population, has about 36 percent of the country's telephone lines. However, as shown in Figure 1. 1,&#13;
the regional distribution of telephone service throughout Indonesia, excluding Jakarta, is reasonably&#13;
balanced. Outside of Jakarta, Sumatra and Irian Jaya are better served than the rest of the country.&#13;
The telephone penetration in Jakarta was 9.7 lines per 100 population while the rest of the country&#13;
averaged 0.85 lines per 100 inhabitants. The penetration ranged from a high of 1.28 lines per 100&#13;
population in the best served regions to 0.67 per 100 population in the worst served regions of the&#13;
country. The regional distribution of telephone lines reflects the concentration of economic activity&#13;
(especially in Jakarta) as well as of population in the different regions. Partly as a result of the Bank's&#13;
Third and Fourth Telecommunications Projects, the access to service in East Indonesia improved&#13;
substantially during the REPELITA V period with an average annual growth rate of about 35 percent&#13;
per annum compared to about 8 percent during REPELITA IV. Public telecommunications service is&#13;
currently available in all 27 provinces, 55 municipalities, 236 district capitals and 2,869 of the 3,539 sub-&#13;
districts. However, of approximately 67,600 villages in the country, only 10,000 have telephone service.&#13;
With the opening of all areas outside Jakarta and Surabaya to private sector through the Joint Operation&#13;
Schemes (para. 1.17) during REPELITA VI, service will become available to the remaining sub-&#13;
districts and 50 percent of the villages. In addition, the quality of service is expected to improve and&#13;
new services currently not available will be introduced. Detailed regional distribution of telephone are&#13;
shown in Annex 1.&#13;

Institutional Framework&#13;
1.3       The GOI exercises extensive regulatory authority and supervisory control over the&#13;
telecommunications sector through the Ministry of Tourism, Posts and Telecommunications (MTPT). The&#13;
MTPT Organization Chart is in Annex 2. The Telecommunications Law and certain regulations and&#13;
decrees establish the legal framework for regulation of the telecommunications sector. Furthermore,&#13;
REPELITA plans for the sector are established through the Ministry's Planning Bureau and regulations&#13;
through its Law and Organization Bureau. Both bureaus report to the Secretary General of the MTPT.&#13;
Within the MTPT, the Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunication (DGPT) supervises the&#13;
directorates of telecommunications, frequency management and standardization. In addition to MTPT,&#13;
important roles are played by the Ministry of Finance, the National Development Planning Agency&#13;
(BAPPENAS), and State Ministry for Research and Technology (BPPT). The Ministry of Finance, as the&#13;
owner, approves budgets and oversees TELKOM's financial performance. BAPPENAS coordinates and&#13;
controls the GOI's Five-Year planning process (REPELITA) and approves investment plan funding. BPPT&#13;
has a lead role in determining the introduction of the new technologies and their timing.&#13;
1.4    Faced with rapidly increasing demands for telecommunications services and equipment, the GOI&#13;
enacted the Telecommunications Law in 1989 to facilitate the introduction of new technologies and to&#13;
stimulate the growth of the telecommunications sector by tapping the resources of the private sector.&#13;
Specifically, the Telecommunications Law permitted private sector participation in the provision of non-&#13;
basic services without association or cooperation with either TELKOM or INDOSAT subject to licensing&#13;
from the MTPT. Furthermore, decrees promulgated in 1993 after a high level Bank/MTPT seminar on&#13;
sector development, permitted private sector participation in the provision of basic' domestic and&#13;
international telecommunication services through the establishment of management agreements, joint&#13;
operation schemes or joint venture corporations with TELKOM or INDOSAT.&#13;
Market Structure&#13;
1.5       TELKOM  (a state owned  enterprise) is the primary  provider of basic domestic&#13;
telecommunications services. RATELINDO (a majority privately owned joint venture with TELKOM) was&#13;
authorized in 1993 to provide basic telecommunications services using wireless technology in Jakarta and&#13;
Bandung. RATELINDO expects to begin offering service by mid-1995. INDOSAT (a partially privatized&#13;
state-owned  enterprise) is the primary provider of   international telecommunications services.&#13;
SATELINDO (a majority privately owned joint venture with TELKOM and [NDOSAT) began providing&#13;
international direct dialing telephone, low and high-speed leased lines and telecast service in November&#13;
1994. In addition to TELKOM and INDOSAT, there are currently five private companies authorized to&#13;
provide cellular services (Annex 3); four companies for Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) services&#13;
(Annex 1); four companies for E-mail services; and one company for each of the following services:&#13;
In general, basic services involve delivery of information between sender and receiver without processing or&#13;
modification and include telephone, telex, telegram and leased circuits. Non-basic services are defuned&#13;
generally as services resulting from the ability of computers and sophisticated telecommunications facilities to&#13;
process and modify the form of data contained therein. Examples of these services include store and forward&#13;
facsimile, electronic data interchange and E-mail.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Packet-Switched Data Network (PSDN), low-speed leased lines, and store and forward facsimile. In&#13;
addition, three equipment suppliers manufacture and supply switching equipment on a competitive basis in&#13;
Indonesia. There are four private limited liability companies manufacturing telephone cables and 14 small&#13;
privately owned companies manufacturing telecommunications equipments.&#13;
1.6       The market and ownership structures of the Indonesian telecommunications sector are shown in&#13;
Table 1.2. This table shows that the Indonesian telecommunications sector has moved decisively away&#13;
from the model of predominant state-owned enterprise monopoly that existed as recently as two years ago.&#13;
Nevertheless, as a result of the requirements of the Telecommunications Law, the provision of basic fixed&#13;
telecommunications involves substantial cross-ownership. Thus, TELKOM and/or fNDOSAT have&#13;
significant ownership interests in all basic service operations.&#13;
1.7       The structure of the cellular mobile market is shown in Annex 3. Until very recently this&#13;
market was dominated by regional operators working under revenue sharing agreements with TELKOM.&#13;
Decisions taken in 1993 and 1994 are already beginning to transform the cellular market. SATELINDO has&#13;
been awarded a national license to provide cellular service using GSM technology and will be supported by&#13;
its new strategic investor, Deutsche Telekom. Similarly, in late 1994, TELKOMSEL, a joint venture of&#13;
TELKOM and INDOSAT, was awarded a national GSM cellular license and is believed to be seeking an&#13;
experienced foreign partner. At the same time, the regional revenue sharing operators are being converted&#13;
to majority private joint ventures with TELKOM. Thus, important elements of competition are being&#13;
introduced for the provision of cellular mobile service in all areas.&#13;
1.8       Notwithstanding cross-ownership in the sector, competition is beginning to develop because&#13;
both SATELINDO and RATELINDO have majority private investment, different foreign operator partners&#13;
(namely Deutsche Telekom and Netherlands PTT respectively) and separate management from TELKOM&#13;
and INDOSAT. Also, TELKOM's ownership interests in SATELINDO and RATELINDO will decline&#13;
proportionately as private investment in these companies increases. For example, once SATEL[NDO's&#13;
arrangements with its new partner, Deutsche Telekom, are completed, TELKOM's ownership share will&#13;
decline from 30% to 22.5%. Furthernore, the substitutability of different types of telecommunications&#13;
services, such as mobile cellular service for conventional fixed service, VSAT private networks for&#13;
terrestrial leased lines, and the fact that cellular local calling areas are likely, in some cases, to include&#13;
services that TELKOM would charge as long-distance calls, will result in more competition than implied by&#13;
the market segment stratification shown in Table 1.2.&#13;

Tariffs&#13;
1.9       Tariff Study. TELKOM's tariffs were reviewed in-depth by external consultants during&#13;
1994. The consultants' findings were:&#13;
(a)   TELKOM's overall level of tariffs is high in relation to its total costs and should be&#13;
reduced in real terms over a period of time;&#13;
(b)   The level of the installation charge is substantially above costs. This charge should be&#13;
gradually lowered in real terms (as a result of inflation) by maintaining the existing&#13;
connection charges;&#13;
(c)   Monthly subscription and local call charges are low and should be increased;&#13;
(d)   Long-distance charges are substantially above costs and should be reduced. Furthermore,&#13;
the number of long-distance charging bands should be reduced in order to simplify the&#13;
tariff and reflect the reduced cost-sensitivity of long-distance calling now that the&#13;
capacity of TELKOM's long-distance network has been substantially increased; and&#13;
(e)   Leased line charges should be reduced.&#13;
1.10      Tariff Levels and Structure: In response to the findings of the study, the Govemnment&#13;
authorized new tariffs that came into effect on January 1, 1995. The new tariff schedule makes&#13;
substantial improvements in the structure of the tariff, very much in line with the recommended&#13;
directions of the comprehensive tariff study completed by consultants. Telephone installation charges&#13;
were reduced in most cases and the number of different regional charging zones reduced from ten to five.&#13;
At the same time, differential charging for different customer categories (business, residential or several&#13;
purpose) was introduced. The overall reduction in these high installation charges, which were originally&#13;
intended, in part, to ration scarce new telephone lines, reflects both the easing of the shortage and a&#13;
simultaneous increase in monthly rental charges. Monthly rental charges, the minimum payment made&#13;
by customers each month regardless of telephone usage, have been substantially increased, for example,&#13;
in Jakarta from Rp. 10,000/month for all customers to Rp.15,500 for a social purpose customer, Rp.20,500&#13;
for a residential customer, and Rp.31,000 for a business customer. At the same time, the number of&#13;
differential charging zones has been reduced from ten to five (as for installation charges). Even in the&#13;
least expensive zone, monthly charges have been increased from Rp.5,000/month to Rp.10,500, Rp.&#13;
13,000 or Rp.21,000 for the different customer categories. Importantly, this change is accompanied by&#13;
inclusion of a number of free local calls. The net effect of these changes is to substantially eliminate the&#13;
previous price incentive for consumption inefficiency whereby some customers would rent a telephone&#13;
line below cost and make very few if any calls. Telephone usage charges were also restructured with (a)&#13;
a ten percent increase in the price of local calls, (b) a reduction in the distance-sensitivity of long-&#13;
distance charges implemented by reducing the number of long-distance charging bands from five to&#13;
three, and (c) the introduction of significant discounts for off-peak usage. The overall effect of these&#13;
changes in TELKOM's installation, monthly rental and usage charges, is to achieve a significantly&#13;
improved tariff structure in terms of its incentives for economically efficient consumption of telephone&#13;
services. TELKOM's tariffs are shown in Annex 4.&#13;
&#13;

B. Sector Reform&#13;
Strategic Sector Issues&#13;
1.11       The Challenges.  Inadequacies of the Indonesian telecommunications sector, both in&#13;
quantity and quality of service, are a constraint to sustained industrial and export growth and regional&#13;
development (para 1.1). To overcome these constraints, actions are required on the following: (a)&#13;
mobilizing on attractive terms the capital needed for massive investments to accelerate network&#13;
expansion (Fig.1.2); (b) ensuring world class operator participation to harness fully the benefits of&#13;
emerging technology and modem operating practices; (c) improving regional service delivery through&#13;
effective decentralization; and (d) developing TELKOM into a modern, efficient and business-oriented&#13;
company.&#13;

1.12       Private Sector Participation. Meeting the financial, managerial and technical requirements&#13;
of a competitive telecommunications sector development are predicated upon private sector&#13;
participation. Hence, there is a need to create an appropriate framework for efficient private sector&#13;
participation which creates both the capacity and incentives for excellent performance. Creating such a&#13;
framework will require major organizational changes in TELKOM that would pave the way for strategic&#13;
alliances with first-class international telecommunications operators.&#13;
1.13       Enabling Environment. With the emergence of a significant role for private investors and&#13;
operators, regulatory oversight will need to be strengthened. First, the GOI needs to review the&#13;
telecommunications law that has mandated TELKOM and/or fNDOSAT equity stakes in all basic service&#13;
providers and thereby stifled the development of competition in the sector. Second, MTPT's capacity to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
monitor the performance of operators, to impose penalties for poor performance and to respond in a&#13;
timely way to new regulatory issues, needs to be significantly strengthened.&#13;
1.14      Tariffs. A key goal of opening the telecommunications sector to private participation is to&#13;
bring the provision of services in all parts of Indonesia up to internationally competitive levels in terms&#13;
of price and performance. Accordingly, the future tariff policy should provide operators an incentive for&#13;
cost efficiency and ensure that benefits of efficiency gains are shared equitably by both customers and&#13;
investors. Inefficiency should not be shielded by accommodating tariff adjustments.&#13;
Government Objectives and Strategy&#13;
1.15      Objectives. The GOI  recognizes that, because information has become a fundamental&#13;
factor of production, adequate telecommunications infrastructure and services are key prerequisites for&#13;
economic development. Thus, the GOI considers telecommunications a strategic investment for the&#13;
Indonesian economy to maintain a competitive advantage and to participate effectively in the global&#13;
economy. Furthermore, the GOI recognizes that telecommunications can play a key role in regional&#13;
development and delivery of social services. Commensurate with these considerations, the GOI intends&#13;
to improve rapidly the quality and coverage of service, while reducing the costs, so as to match the&#13;
telecommunications performance standards of its East Asian economic competitors. In particular, the&#13;
GOI's objectives are to substantially eliminate unmet demand for service by planning for the&#13;
construction of a minimum five million additional lines during 1994-1999, a pre-requisite for upgrading&#13;
sector performance to world-class standards.&#13;
1.16      Strategy. The strategy to achieve these objectives constitutes a fundamental departure from&#13;
past practices in that the GOI will be relying mainly on private sector investment and expertise, in an&#13;
increasingly competitive, multi-operator environment. This strategy, outlined below, which has already&#13;
been initiated by the GOI, involves large scale Build/Joint-Operate/Transfer Schemes (JOS), partial&#13;
privatization initiatives, increased competition, and development of the legal and regulatory environment&#13;
for the sector. The GOI has furnished to the Bank a Policy Letter which elaborates its strategy for&#13;
development of the telecommunications sector (Annex 5). This letter forms the basis for implementing&#13;
the telecommunications sector agenda and associated Bank support.&#13;
Private Entry&#13;
1.17      Joint Operation Schemes.   The GOI is in the process of establishing  JOS contracts&#13;
between TELKOM and private consortia for the provision of local telephone service in five of the seven&#13;
regions. The JOS will involve the construction, during REPELITA VI, of a minimum of two million&#13;
new lines (with an investment cost of approximately US $2 billion) by private consortia that include&#13;
first-class foreign operators, and the operation of both new and existing local network facilities on an&#13;
integrated basis in these five regions, which comprise about 40 percent of the overall market (see Map&#13;
26332). The consortia will be granted limited exclusivity, until 1999, for the provision of fixed local&#13;
telephone services in their regions. Separate authorizations would be required to provide other services&#13;
(para. 1.4). The prequalification of private consortia was completed in September 1994.2&#13;
2 Prequalified consortia, each comprising both Indonesian investors and one or more foreign operators, including:&#13;
ATI-Alberta (Canada), Bell Canada, Cable and Wireless, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, GTE (USA),&#13;
Korean Telecom, New Zealand Telecom, Nynex (USA), NTT (Japan), Malaysia Telekom, Singapore Telecom,&#13;
and Testra (Australia).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
1.18      The JOS bids were opened in the presence of representatives of all bidders on March 21,&#13;
1995 and the contents of Bid Summary Forms were read out. The success of this process hinges on how&#13;
well the next steps are managed: (a) the selection of the five consortia; (b) completion of negotiations&#13;
and finalization of contracts with the five consortia; and (c) monitoring the JOS operators' performance.&#13;
Therefore, during negotiations assurances were obtained from GOI and TELKOM that: (i) GOI will, by&#13;
January 31, 1996, cause TELKOM to finalize and sign the JOS contracts paying due regard to the Bank's&#13;
comments on the draft contractual terms submitted to the Bank for its review and thereafter furnish&#13;
copies of signed contracts; (ii) TELKOM will sign contracts, with the five selected consortia by January&#13;
31, 1996; and (iii) GOT will appoint by June 30, 1996, qualified consultants to assist DGPT to obtain a&#13;
professionally sound assessment of the operational performance of TELKOM and the five JOS operators&#13;
under the JOS contracts. Copies of the consultants' report will be furnished to the Bank for its review&#13;
and comments by June 30 of each year, commencing June 1997.&#13;
1.19      The limited geographical application of the JOS approach recognizes several factors: (a) the&#13;
telecommunications development challenge is the greatest outside of the Jakarta and Surabaya regions,&#13;
where the telephone density is the lowest and other services such as cellular, paging and data&#13;
communications are not available. The initial assignment of foreign operator consortia to these areas&#13;
matches their technical and managerial capabilities to the challenge of accelerated business development.&#13;
In contrast, the Jakarta and Surabaya regions have already been developed to the point that they can be&#13;
handled successfully by TELKOM's management which has been strengthened steadily in recent years;&#13;
and (b) the judgment of the GOI that it would be best to gain experience with the JOS initiative before&#13;
extending it on a national scale. More details on the joint operation scheme are provided in Annex 6.&#13;
1.20      Privatization. The GOI selected INDOSAT as the flag bearer for its fledgling privatization&#13;
program across various sectors. INDOSAT successfully placed approximately 32 percent of its shares to&#13;
public shareholders through its initial public offering in October 1994. These shares are listed and traded&#13;
on the New York and Jakarta stock exchanges. TELKOM is expected to follow with a similar partial&#13;
privatization during REPELITA VI. This will be a positive development since the stock exchange&#13;
disclosure requirements and the vigilance of institutional investors will enhance the business orientation&#13;
of TELKOM's management. During negotiations, agreements were reached with GOI that it will, prior&#13;
to carrying out full or partial divestiture of TELKOM or the sale of TELKOM shares in major joint&#13;
venture companies providing basic telecommunications services, afford the Bank a reasonable&#13;
opportunity to exchange views with the Government and TELKOM on such proposed divestiture or sale&#13;
and thereafter, carry out said divestiture or sale, paying due regard to the Bank's comments and&#13;
recommendations, if any.&#13;
Enabling Environment&#13;
1.21      Legal Framework. The importance of providing benefits to customers as well as giving&#13;
incentives for private participation highlights the need to build on the earlier reforms to the&#13;
Telecommunications Law in 1989. GOI recognizes that this reform process needs to be conducted with a&#13;
view to developing regulatory oversight of the sector that fairly balances the interests of government,&#13;
consumers, investors, financiers and operators in the emerging multi-operator environment. The first&#13;
stage of this process, involving an examination of international best practice in telecommunications&#13;
regulation and an analysis of the shortcomings of the existing legal framework and developing&#13;
recommendations for legal and regulatory reform, is already underway. Technical assistance is provided&#13;
under the proposed project to help develop the legal and regulatory framework to further promote&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
efficient private sector participation in the telecommunications sector. During negotiations, agreement&#13;
was reached with GOI that it will annually review with the Bank progress achieved in the development&#13;
of the legal and regulatory framework.&#13;
1.22      Regulation. The GOI is planning to proceed gradually with the institutional development of&#13;
the regulatory function. The immediate and most important step is to build a regulatory framework on&#13;
the basis of clear-cut contractual arrangements with the new entrants into the telecommunications sector,&#13;
which is being done satisfactorily under the present institutional arrangements. The creation of JOS are&#13;
establishing regulatory mechanisms by specifying rights and obligations through contracts on key issues&#13;
- the period of agreement, the responsibility for the assets used, the extent of competition, the pricing of&#13;
the services and the quality of service to be achieved. They will determine how benefits and risks will be&#13;
shared among TELKOM, the private sector party, and the customers. Furthermore, in a move to&#13;
establish independent regulatory oversight in the Ministry, all TELKOM staff, who had been seconded to&#13;
the Ministry, have now returned to TELKOM. A program to upgrade the technical capabilities of the&#13;
Ministry's regulatory activities is in place and will be further strengthened by this project.&#13;
Tariff Policies&#13;
1.23      The GOI recognizes that appropriate tariffs are key elements of maintaining an environment&#13;
in the sector that is attractive for investors, provides incentives for efficiency, and protects customer&#13;
interests, and which thereby contributes to the international competitiveness of the Indonesian economy.&#13;
Therefore, the GOI has decided that, in reviewing TELKOM's tariffs periodically (in principle every&#13;
three years), to use as a comparator the performance of the highest efficiency service provider operating&#13;
in Indonesia and in Indonesia's competitor countries in the East Asia region while taking into account the&#13;
requirements of telecommunications operators in Indonesia to attract capital for future construction and&#13;
expansion. Thus, the tariff setting will be performance based and be applied uniformly to all. As a result&#13;
of this approach, one would see significant real reductions in the overall level of tariffs for basic&#13;
telecommunications services. During negotiations, the above principles and the information the GOI&#13;
would use in revising principal tariff for basic telecommunications services were agreed on. In addition,&#13;
GOI agreed that it will exchange views with the Bank prior to adopting tariff revisions for basic&#13;
telecommunications services.&#13;
Sector Vision&#13;
1.24      The Indonesian telecommunications sector is going through a period of significant structural&#13;
transformation from almost total state monopoly of basic services to emerging competitive, multi-&#13;
operator environment, a predominance of private sector investment, substantial elimination of unmet&#13;
demand, and dramatic improvements in operational efficiency and customer service with declining real&#13;
prices. During REPELITA VI about 50 percent of new investment in the sector will be private and it is&#13;
expected that the telecommunications law will have been overhauled to eliminate the requirement for&#13;
TELKOM or INDOSAT to have equity stakes in all basic service operators.&#13;
1.25      Evolution of Competition. The dynamics of these initiatives that have already been taken&#13;
by the GOI are likely to lead to more competition in the future. Thus, as the costs of cellular technology&#13;
continue to decline, this service will increasingly be a competitive alternative to conventional fixed&#13;
telephone service.  Furthermore, within 5 or so years, there is a potential that the regional JOS&#13;
arrangements will have been converted into autonomous regional operating companies, each with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
participation of a highly qualified foreign operator, providing not only local service but, prospectively,&#13;
also long-distance service within their own operating region in competition with TELKOM and&#13;
SATELINDO. Similarly, cellular operators that are currently limited to providing local service on their&#13;
own network facilities could in the future be authorized to link their cell sites with their own&#13;
transmission facilities, thereby creating additional long-distance operators. Just as other countries that&#13;
have initiated liberalization of the telecommunications sector (such as Australia, Malaysia or the United&#13;
Kingdom) started somewhat cautiously before moving to authorize increased competition in the sector,&#13;
Indonesia is on a path towards much increased competition in the sector. Expectations are that, by the&#13;
beginning of REPELITA VII, Indonesia may have one of the most competitive telecommunications&#13;
sectors in Asia, second only to Malaysia, with competition in all important market segments: terminals,&#13;
basic local services, pay phones, cellular mobile telephone service, long-distance service, leased lines,&#13;
VSAT private networks, international service, and value-added services.&#13;
C. Bank Group Role&#13;
Global Experience&#13;
1.26      The Bank has been involved in the telecommunications sector since the mid-1960's.&#13;
Initially, the Bank focused on financing investment to modernize and expand physical plant. This&#13;
included some strengthening of the operating enterprises (mainly in the areas of accounting and finance,&#13;
planning and project preparation, and implementation) and improving dialogues with governments&#13;
(especially regarding tariffs and finances). In the 1970s, broader efforts were made to strengthen the&#13;
telecommunications' enterprises' organization and management. In the mid-1980's the Bank further&#13;
expanded the scope of its support for telecommunications, emphasizing sectoral reforms including,&#13;
where appropriate, the privatization of state telecommunications enterprises. In recent years, the Bank&#13;
has focused its attention on overall sector policies, environment and institutional structures and assisted&#13;
governments in the formulation and implementation of sector strategies designed to meet demand. This&#13;
approach has included advocating policies designed to promote new entry, competition and private&#13;
participation. In order to implement this new agenda, fuller use has been made of the range of assistance&#13;
instruments available in the Bank Group, including sector work, investment lending, adjustment,&#13;
technical assistance, underwriting and syndication and political risk insurance.&#13;
1.27      International experience suggests that: (a) in countries with a very small base of telephones,&#13;
divestiture and privatization of the incumbent monopolist is at best, a partial solution to closing the gap&#13;
between demand and supply. More important than this "top-down" approach is likely to be various&#13;
"bottom-up" approaches, funded by a mix of public and private capital, involving new concessions to&#13;
independent wireline and wireless (cellular radio) telephone companies, build-transfer schemes and joint&#13;
ventures; and (b) among the various options (management contracts, joint venture and privatization) for&#13;
introducing fresh management and technical expertise into the sector, the most potent approach is for&#13;
leading international telecommunications operators to make an equity investment in the sector's&#13;
operations. Such operators can bring hands-on experience and highly developed management systems to&#13;
the development of local human resources, skills and institutional capabilities. The proposed project&#13;
design takes these lessons into account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Experience in Indonesia&#13;
1.28      Since the mid-1980s, the Bank has made three loans to the sector: the Technical Assistance&#13;
Project in 1986; and the Third and the Fourth Telecommunications Projects in 1990 and 1992,&#13;
respectively. In implementing these projects, the GOI has made impressive progress in improving the&#13;
performance and transforming the structure of the sector (paras. 1.1 to 1.7).  Substantial private&#13;
investments are being made in the sector. Key sector reform initiatives that have been taken by the GOI&#13;
in recent years include the following:&#13;
(a)    The enactment in 1989 of a new telecommunications law (Law No. 3) permitting&#13;
competition in the provision of value-added services.&#13;
(b)    Conversion in 1991 of TELKOM from a '"perum" state corporation to a limited liability&#13;
"persero" company and implementation of a program of commercialization and&#13;
performance improvements.&#13;
(c)    Promulgation in 1993 of a decree to expand the scope for private investment in the&#13;
provision of basic services, i.e. through joint ventures and joint operations with the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
(d)    The licensing in 1993 of PT. SATELINDO, a majority privately-owned joint venture with&#13;
TELKOM and INDOSAT, to provide satellite, cellular telephone and international&#13;
telecommunications services. SATELINDO commenced providing service in November&#13;
1994.&#13;
(e)    The licensing in 1993 of PT. RATELINDO, also a majority privately-owned joint venture&#13;
with TELKOM and 1NDOSAT, to provide basic local telephone service in Jakarta and&#13;
Bandung using wireless technology. With significant investment from the Netherlands&#13;
PTT, plans are to install over 300,000 lines - the largest wireless local telephone service&#13;
project in Asia. RATELINDO is expected to commence service provision by mid-1995.&#13;
IFC Involvement&#13;
1.29      The Bank has maintained a close dialogue with IFC in respect of private entry into the&#13;
telecommunications sector in Indonesia, in particular, the Joint Operations Schemes. IFC has indicated&#13;
that the JOS concept, which has been structured to provide for competitive private sector entry, would&#13;
constitute a promising opportunity for IFC. Such an opportunity had not existed in the past. IFC has&#13;
already held preliminary discussions with a number of JOS bidders and anticipates involvement in some&#13;
of the JOS consortia.&#13;
Bank Stratkga&#13;
1.30   The Bank's dialogue in preparing this project has focused on restructuring the sector. Thus,&#13;
the Bank has provided assistance to reorganize the sector, create openings for private investors and&#13;
operators in basic services, rationalize tariff policies, introduce competition in various segments of the&#13;
sector, address regulatory issues and to reorganize the corporatized TELKOM and decentralize its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
management process. In particular, in recent months, the Bank has focused on helping the GOI to&#13;
establish the competitive JOS bidding process on bringing cheaper and better telecommunications&#13;
systems which support the international competitiveness of the Indonesian economy and the interests of&#13;
customers in all parts of the country. A summary of the performance levels expected at the end of 1999&#13;
are in Table 1.3. Regional performance targets to be achieved during REPELITA VI are in Annex 7.&#13;

Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.31      The proposed project is an integral part of Bank assistance to Indonesia. It will alleviate&#13;
crucial bottlenecks in the telecommunications infrastructure, expand the coverage of service throughout&#13;
the country and help enhance overall competitiveness of the Indonesian economy (Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy was discussed by the Board on March 21, 1995). By blending policy advice and carefully&#13;
targeting technical assistance with priority physical investments to exploit emerging technologies, the&#13;
project will be an appropriate culmination of the Bank's years of commitment to modernize Indonesia's&#13;
telecommunications sector.  The GOI's reform  agenda is consistent with the Bank's policy for&#13;
telecommunications which advocates commercializing operations, encouraging new entrants and&#13;
competition, increasing private participation, and shifting the role of GOI from ownership and operation&#13;
to policy and regulation. The Bank has played a critical role in promoting this reform agenda in&#13;
Indonesia and expectation of the proposed Bank loan has figured prominently in the GOI's decisions on&#13;
sector refonn.  The GOI would like to see continued Bank involvement in the sector because of the&#13;
Bank's track record of quality assistance in supporting the GOI's reform program. The GOI also values&#13;
the Bank as a unique source of cross-country experience and as a stabilizing factor in helping oversee&#13;
major players and in mitigating the risk of policy reversals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK AND SERVICES&#13;
A. Telecommunication Network&#13;
Demand&#13;
2.1       The demand for telephone service in Indonesia at present far exceeds supply. Official&#13;
waiting lists were discontinued sometime ago as they were creating public expectations about the&#13;
provision of services. A JICA report prepared in 1993 indicates that the demand for telephone service&#13;
will rise to 8 million by 1998/99 (Annex 8). The demand forecast is based on the economic indicators,&#13;
existing tariffs, and the size of the current and forecasted population. The forecast demand for 1998/99&#13;
is segmented into the business and residential categories: business 3.8 million and residential 4.2 million&#13;
lines. With the expected reduction in tariffs (para. 1.23) due to efficiencies gains, demand for telephone&#13;
service is likely to rise above 8 million.&#13;
Local Telephone Network&#13;
2.2       The number of telephone lines in service experienced an average annual growth rate of 18.9&#13;
percent for the period 1983 to 1993. This high rate of growth continues. In 1993, the number of lines in&#13;
service grew to 1.9 million representing an increase of about 21 percent over the previous year. In 1994&#13;
it grew to 2.5 million representing an increase of about 32 percent. TELKOM forecasts a sustained&#13;
growth equivalent to at least 25 percent annually from 1994 to the year 2000 (Fig. 2.1). Sustained&#13;
growth at these levels will make Indonesia one of the most rapidly expanding telecommunications&#13;
networks in the region.&#13;
2.3       The total number of lines in service in 1993 were 1.9 million, of which 1.5 million were in&#13;
the urban network, and 0.4 million lines in rural areas (Annex 1). Lines in service vary considerably&#13;
among provinces, from about 0.7 million lines in Jakarta to 0.015 in Maluku (Annex 1).&#13;
2.4       Development of the customer access networks (CANs) has lagged behind that of exchanges,&#13;
resulting in idle switching capacity. Nationwide, in 1993, only 64 percent of the exchange lines were&#13;
connected to customers. In the urban areas, 72 percent of capacity was utilized, compared with over 90&#13;
percent that normally should be expected given the existence of large unmet demand. This is a major&#13;
problem in many developing countries, resulting from the complexity of constructing underground cable&#13;
networks compared to installing exchanges. However, given TELKOM's rapid expansion of the CAN,&#13;
idle switching capacity is expected to be quickly utilized. Furthermore, the introduction of wireless&#13;
system in the local loop to overcome the complexities of constructing underground cable networks to be&#13;
deployed under the Fourth Telecommunications Project, together with improved project coordination,&#13;
will moderate this situation.&#13;

Year&#13;
2.5       During the past decade, TELKOM  has focused largely on introducing new technology for&#13;
switching, inter-exchange transmission and network management. Attention now needs to be focused on&#13;
the modernization of the CANs because these access networks provide the delivery systems for a wide&#13;
range of modern and sophisticated information and telecommunications services to business enterprises and&#13;
residential end users. Unless CANs are modernized, serious service bottlenecks will occur. The most&#13;
immediate technical issues are: bandwidth on demand, quality and costs.&#13;
2.6       In line with the growing importance of data communication for businesses of all types and&#13;
sizes, the prime concern of the business community is service bandwidth. The existing, largely copper-&#13;
based customer access networks cannot generally be used as the carrier for broadband services over 2 Mb/s.&#13;
For widespread use of data communications, availability and integrity of the CAN are vital. The crucial&#13;
need for the future is for TELKOM to be able to deliver CANs of higher quality and greater bandwidth at&#13;
reasonable costs to enhance the competitiveness of existing business, as well as to attract new business to&#13;
Indonesia. Since the CAN accounts for the largest part of the total network expenditure in both original&#13;
investment costs and recurrent operating costs, emerging technologies such as Fiber in the Loop will be&#13;
deployed under the proposed project.&#13;
Long Distance Network&#13;
2.7       The domestic long distance network consists of two main components: (l) terrestrial and (2)&#13;
satellite. The terrestrial network is based on microwave radio and coaxial as well as optic fiber cables. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
mainly uses the microwave system, stretching from Aceh in Sumatra to Ujung Pandang in Sulawesi, and&#13;
includes Java and Nusa Tenggara.  This terrestrial network includes the new fiber optic cable&#13;
transmission link between Jakarta and Surabaya, and the submarine cable link between Surabaya and&#13;
Banjarmasin. In order to accommodate traffic growth and improve network reliability, a second optic&#13;
fiber cable transmission link will be provided between Jakarta and Surabaya. Furthermore, to improve&#13;
services to Kalimantan and Sulawesi, submarine optic fiber cables will be installed between: (i)&#13;
Surabaya-Banjarmansin-Ujung Pandang; and (ii) Pangkalpinang-Pontianak (Map 26333).&#13;
2.8       The satellite transmission system consists of the B-generation of Palapa satellites (including&#13;
B2P, B2R AND B4 models), and 216 earth stations. Two more new C-generation satellites are&#13;
scheduled to be commissioned in 1995 and 1996. Each of these will be equipped with 34 transponders,&#13;
10 transponders more than the B-generation satellites. All Palapa satellites are managed and operated&#13;
by PT. SATELINDO, a joint venture corporation owned by PT. Bimagraha Telekom Indo, a private&#13;
company (60 percent), TELKOM (30 percent) and INDOSAT (10 percent).&#13;
International Network&#13;
2.9       INDOSAT  is the primary provider of international telecommunications services.&#13;
International switched telecommunications services including:  telephone, telex, telegram, packet&#13;
switched data, store and forward facsimile are provided through gateways in Jakarta, Medan and Batam&#13;
using more than 3,770 circuits via three earth stations, submarine cables and microwave transmission&#13;
systems. INDOSAT is constructing a new gateway in Surabaya which is scheduled to be ready for&#13;
service in April, 1995. International direct-dialing can be made to 209 destinations throughout the world.&#13;
In recent years, INDOSAT has launched a variety of non-switched telecommunications services that&#13;
typically involve the transmission of data or video rather than voice traffic. SATELINDO began to offer&#13;
international services, in November 1994, in competition with INDOSAT.&#13;
Non-voice and Other Facilities&#13;
2.10      Packet-Switched Data Network (PSDN) is provided by Lintasarta, a joint venture company&#13;
owned by TELKOM, INDOSAT and Bank Indonesia.   Currently, Lintasarta provides such&#13;
telecommunications services as a digital data network service at the speed of up to 64Kbps, a packet&#13;
switched data network service (dial-up at 300 and 1,200 bps, and dedicated at 300, 1,200 and 4,800 bps),&#13;
leased line service (local at up to 2,400 bps and intercity at up to 1,200 bps), and a VSAT network&#13;
service. It also provides several banking information services: a banking reporting service, a banking&#13;
information management service, an ATM service, and a banking payment service. These services are&#13;
available in the following cities: Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Semarang, Yogyakarta, Denpasar, Medan,&#13;
Palembang, Batam, and Ujung Pandang. As of December 1993, a total of 1,875 customers are using&#13;
Lintasarta's data communication network services. PSDN is also connected through the facilities of&#13;
INDOSAT to directly or indirectly exchange data with users of approximately 116 other public packet-&#13;
switched data networks in 49 countries.&#13;

B. Service Access and Quality&#13;
Access to Service&#13;
2.11      Telephone.  At the end of 1993 there were 1.9 million working lines in operation in&#13;
Indonesia, giving a density 1.0 line per 100 population, significantly below that in OECD countries and&#13;
the lowest in the ASEAN countries. Figure 2.2 gives some comparative examples for telephone density&#13;
as of the end of 1993 in Asian countries. In 1993, the density in Jakarta was 7.74 lines per 100&#13;
population. However, the average density for the rest of the country is only 0.67 lines per 100&#13;
population. The regional distribution of access to service is discussed in para 1.2 in more detail.&#13;

2.12      As of December 31, 1993, there were 235,000 IDD lines. INDOSAT's top 100 customers&#13;
accounted for approximately 9.3 percent of outgoing calls with 70 percent originating in Jakarta followed&#13;
by 5.8 percent from Denpasar in Bali by revenue billed in 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
2.13       To provide a basic level of service and access to facilities to the non-subscribing public, the&#13;
concept of Wartels was introduced in 1989. Wartels are franchised phone offices, from where local,&#13;
long distance and international calls can be made and telexes, faxes and telegrams sent. Some 1,103&#13;
Wartels operate throughout the country. In addition, there are currently 49,556 pay phones, comprising&#13;
2.6 percent of TELKOM total lines. TELKOM's policy is to allocate 3.0 percent of the network capacity&#13;
to provide payphones. This target is comparable to the standards followed by other international&#13;
telecommunications administrations.&#13;
2.14      Telex and Telegraph. Aside from facsimile transmitted over the telephone network, telex is&#13;
the most important non-voice service in Indonesia and accounts for approximately 3 percent of&#13;
TELKOM's operating revenue. Only modest growth of telex lines is expected over the next five years&#13;
because of significant substitution by fax and data. Installed telex switching capacity is sufficient to&#13;
meet demand up to year 2000 and no further increase will be required. Telegram service is provided at&#13;
affordable prices through a network of 689 telegraph offices.&#13;
Quality of Service&#13;
2.15      Quality of telephone service is still relatively poor even though the incidence and duration of&#13;
faults has been significantly reduced since the commencement of the Third Telecommunications Project&#13;
in 1990 (Fig. 2.3). The average duration of faults in switching and inter-office facilities has also&#13;
improved significantly (from 4.7 hours in 1988 to 0.2 hours in 1992) as a result of the introduction of&#13;
digital stored program control (SPC) exchanges and fiber optic digital inter-exchange facilities.&#13;
Indonesia's reported average of 2.6 faults per 100 telephone lines per month in 1993 was lower than in&#13;
several other Asian countries (Fig. 2.4) and comparable to that in the ASEAN countries.&#13;

2.16      Figure 2.5 presents the successful call completion rates (SCR) which were on average 44&#13;
percent for automatically dialed local calls compared to Japan 83, Malaysia 50, Singapore 70 (Fig. 2.6)&#13;
and 36 percent for long distance direct-dialed calls in Indonesia. The ongoing Third and Fourth&#13;
Telecommunications Projects (Ln. 3182 and Ln. 3482) give priority to effective capacity utilization,&#13;
rehabilitation of local networks and increasing traffic handling capacity of the system (Annex 9). In&#13;
addition to the investment component, technical assistance provided under the Third and Fourth&#13;
Telecommunications Projects is aimed at developing TELKOM's capacity to undertake on a continuous&#13;
basis measurements, analysis and forecasting of traffic to provide reliable database for network&#13;
management and optimization. The introduction of the Computerized Cable Administration System&#13;
(CNAS) and the Integrated Management System (IMS) for network management under the above&#13;
projects should substantially improve the quality and quantity of management information available to&#13;
enhance maintenance planning. Further efficiencies are expected to accrue when TELKOM integrates&#13;
these two systems under the proposed project.&#13;

Customer Service&#13;
2.17      TELKOM  is strengthening its customer service units to respond to complaints and resolve&#13;
problems quickly. Training and technical assistance is also being provided by TELKOM to customer's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
employees to improve relations. TELKOM is undertaking a variety of initiatives (para. 2.18) to continue to&#13;
improve its service to its customers and to prepare for competition. TELKOM's approach, based on the&#13;
lead taken by WITEL IV, is to establish Customer Service Groups (CSGs). CSG is aimed at meeting the&#13;
specific needs of business customers and individual VIP customers. Thus, WITEL IV has a CSG for "blue&#13;
chip" customers, who represent 100 businesses with very large monthly call volumes. The CSG staff have&#13;
been grouped into specialized industry teams to better understand the needs of specific customers. The&#13;
concepts of CSGs will be developed further and industry specialization of CSG staff is planned for major&#13;
cities with the assistance of the Netherlands's PTT in Jakarta and Singapore Telecom in cities outside&#13;
Jakarta.&#13;
2.18      TELKOM commenced in 1992 a benchmark survey of its customers to compare its service&#13;
quality against Singapore Telecom. TELKOM plans to carry out this survey at two-year intervals. The&#13;
1992 survey gave a score of 68 percent for overall customer satisfaction and the plan is to raise the score to&#13;
90 percent by 1998. By comparison, Singapore Telecom had a customer satisfaction score of 98.5 percent.&#13;
2.19      TELKOM realizes the enormity of the challenge in raising sales and customer satisfaction&#13;
levels simultaneously. The job requires the Services Directorate to work closely and cooperatively with the&#13;
Development, Operations and Engineering Directorates as well as the WITELS in Indonesia. TELKOM,&#13;
based on terms of reference cleared during appraisal, will hire consultants by December 31, 1995 to help&#13;
manage this particular challenge and integrate all sales and customer service initiatives across its different&#13;
directorates.&#13;
Mobile Radio Services&#13;
2.20      Cellular. Although Indonesia was one of the first developing countries to introduce cellular&#13;
telephone service (in 1986), the growth in cellular customers has been slow compared with many other&#13;
countries. Further, the price of cellular handsets in Indonesia is high, even compared with other Asian&#13;
countries. Several factors have contributed to this situation: lack of coherent and consistent GOI policy&#13;
regarding the introduction of the service; fundamentally unsound pricing and revenue settlement&#13;
arrangements; absence of adequate competition; inadequate spectrum management; exclusive&#13;
distribution of cellular phones; inappropriate interconnection arrangements; unreasonable technology&#13;
constraints; and lack of appropriate development incentives. Details of the current situation regarding&#13;
the mobile cellular operations in Indonesia are given in Annex 3.&#13;
2.21      In view of the disappointing performance of the cellular market segment, which holds&#13;
considerable promise for the provision of cellular telecommunications service throughout Indonesia, the&#13;
Bank, in response to the GOI's request, has engaged consultants under the Japan Grant Fund (JGF) to&#13;
undertake a study of policy options to optimize the performance of the cellular segment. The final&#13;
report, expected by end June 1995, will enable MTPT to formulate a plan for rapid improvement in the&#13;
coverage and quality of service.&#13;
2.22      Paging. Radio paging services are operated by the private sector. In the relatively profitable&#13;
areas such as Jakarta, Medan, Bandung and Surabaya, there is competition between several operators.&#13;
Each operator has an independent revenue sharing arrangement with the network carrier, TELKOM. As&#13;
of December 1994, a total of 27 companies provided paging services in 21 cities for about 73,000 pagers,&#13;
rather low compared to Singapore's 652,000 and Thailand's 350,000. The GOI recently initiated a study&#13;
to identify factors constraining development of this market segment. Based on the findings, measures&#13;
will be introduced during the project to stimulate growth in this market segment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
2.23      In July 1993, PT SKYTELINDO, owned by PT INDOKOM PRIMANUSA (52 percent), a&#13;
telecommunications subsidiary of the Kedaung Group, Singapore Telecom International Private, Ltd. (30&#13;
percent), and Mtel of the US (18 percent), launched its nationwide paging service. At present it covers&#13;
Jakarta, Surabaya and Bandung. The company plans to expand its service coverage to 15 other cities&#13;
within five years.&#13;
2.24      Radio Trunking. At present, there are three nationwide private mobile radio trunking&#13;
service providers, using systems provided by Philips, Nokia, and Motorola. They received provisional&#13;
licenses in 1992 for pilot projects (a test-run for a certain area). The official licenses for operation are&#13;
expected to be issued by mid 1995 after MTPT completes its review of the operators' performance. Two&#13;
of these operators are expected to soon receive approval for commercial operation.&#13;
New Services&#13;
2.25      TELKOM will implement an Intelligent Network (IN) architecture, and Integrated Services&#13;
Digital Network (ISDN) during REPELITA VI. With the deployment of the Intelligent Network (IN),&#13;
TELKOM will be able to offer a variety of telecommunications services including calling cards, virtual&#13;
private networks, 800 services for telemarketing including a free phone number and 900 services like&#13;
tele-voting and tele-polling.  ISDN will provide a high speed network that allows simultaneous&#13;
transmission of voice, data and video to a wide range of customers.  These services require a&#13;
telecommunications network  that can send, exchange, transmit and receive signals at speeds&#13;
significantly higher than that for ordinary telephone service which is 64 kbps (para 2.6). The proposed&#13;
project will help TELKOM build information super highway networks that will support the needs of an&#13;
information oriented society in the 21st century to provide a full range of telecommunications services&#13;
at affordable prices. Incidentally, the provision of information superhighways will be an essential&#13;
requirement in approving JOS operations.&#13;
2.26      Marketing.  Selling and connecting three million lines under REPELITA VI plus the&#13;
remaining one million unsold lines from REPELITA V presents a significant challenge for TELKOM&#13;
over the next five years. TELKOM's projected marketing plan for the years 1995 to 1999 will be&#13;
reviewed and agreed on during negotiations based on their marketing achievements for 1994. Technical&#13;
assistance is provided under the proposed project to assist TELKOM to achieve the above targets, and&#13;
TELKOM expects to achieve 80 percent of this target which, if achieved, will be a remarkable&#13;
improvement compared to its past performance. Given the challenge to market and connect I million&#13;
lines in 1995 and thereafter, it is crucial that TELKOM's management closely monitor their achievement&#13;
in this area. TELKOM has initiated actions, as part of project preparation, to hire consultants to assist&#13;
TELKOM in developing its marketing capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
III. THE BENEFICIARY&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
3.1       On September 24, 1991, the GOI changed the corporate status of PERUMTEL to a limited&#13;
liability company, thereby reflecting the increased commercial mandate and autonomy of the company.&#13;
At the same time its name changed to PT TELEKOMUNIKASI INDONESIA (TELKOM). TELKOM is&#13;
managed by a Board of Executive Directors headed by a President-Director under the supervision of the&#13;
Board of Commissioners. The directors are full-time employees appointed and accountable to the&#13;
Minister of Finance. The President-Director has authority for all operations of TELKOM. In addition to&#13;
the President-Director, the Board includes six other directors with functional responsibility, respectively,&#13;
for engineering; development and logistics; services; operations; finance; and human resources.&#13;
Operational responsibility devolves to 12 regions, and responsibility for major development projects to 4&#13;
project-managers. Also reporting to the Board are several staff units responsible for corporate planning&#13;
and research and development, education and training, information and technology, and the corporate&#13;
inspectorate, an internal audit-unit. TELKOM's organizational structure is shown in Annex 10. The&#13;
management team is dynamic and forward looking and has implemented a number of reforms including&#13;
improving staff communications, streamlining procurement systems and improving accounting and&#13;
financial systems. Nevertheless, the challenge for TELKOM is how rapidly its performance can be&#13;
raised to that of a world class telecommunications operator so that it can compete effectively with private&#13;
sector operators. In order to meet this challenge, TELKOM, with the assistance of consultants financed&#13;
under the Fourth Telecommunications Project, developed detailed restructuring plans to transform&#13;
TELKOM from an engineering-led to a business-oriented company.&#13;
3.2       The Restructuring Plan expected to be completed shortly will result in: (a) a corporate office&#13;
with some 800 staff (down from 3000); (b) seven regional operating divisions (which have been&#13;
developed to align with the proposed JOS areas); (c) a national network division; and (d) several&#13;
subsidiary support divisions including information systems, training and repair, which will be prepared&#13;
for private participation. In addition, a number of non-core activities will be devolved and sold, and&#13;
various related business activities will also be prepared for outside participation, as shown in Annex 11.&#13;
3.3       It is envisaged that in the future TELKOM  will evolve into a relatively small holding&#13;
company with major holdings in: (a) the national network company; (b) the regional operating&#13;
companies; and (c) critical support companies, including information systems, billing, and property. All&#13;
non-core businesses will have been sold to outside interests. Throughout this transition, advice and&#13;
expertise will be provided as part of the proposed project.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
3.4       A summary of TELKOM's staff efficiency and composition is in Annex 12. There have been&#13;
significant improvements in TELKOM's staffing efficiency in recent years, as shown in Figure 3.1. This&#13;
has resulted in part from the growth in the number of main lines connected while holding the total&#13;
number of staff virtually constant and from contracting out a number of non-core services such as local&#13;
cable network design, its construction, maintenance, and janitorial services. TELKOM's staffing ratio of&#13;
20 staff per 1,000 telephone lines compares favorably with that of Malaysia (20), Singapore (14), and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
Thailand (18). With the very substantial quantities of highly reliable digital equipment to be installed in&#13;
the coming years, the overall staffing ratio is expected to be 8/1,000, by 1998, which would be&#13;
comparable to that of the top class telecommunications operators.&#13;

3.5       There are also some imbalances in the current mix of TELKOM employees. For example, at&#13;
the end of 1994, TELKOM's work force included 2,627 university graduates, that is 6.3 percent of total&#13;
staff, relatively low for an entity employing highly sophisticated technology. This ratio would be about&#13;
10 to 15 percent in developed telecommunications entities. To improve its staffing efficiency and in&#13;
order to address the staffing imbalance, TELKOM in 1991, started to develop and improve the&#13;
educational level of its employees. More importantly since 1993, TELKOM has been developing two&#13;
types of human resource planning models; namely, bottom up requirement planning model, and top&#13;
down requirement planning. In the future, TELKOM will develop and implement performance standards&#13;
and systems to improve human resource productivity, planning and control, and quality of staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
Training&#13;
3.6       To address its training challenges, TELKOM has a separate department for training. This&#13;
department known as PUSDIKLAT plays an important role in TELKOM's efforts to upgrade the skills of&#13;
its technical and administrative staff and managers. There are twelve regional training centers (RTCs)&#13;
with about 667 staff, including 175 instructors. A program to upgrading both the central training center&#13;
(CTC) and RTCs, initiated with UNDP-ITU cooperation and supported by UNDP, is currently being&#13;
implemented. Under this program, TELKOM will decentralize much of its technical, administrative,&#13;
operational and supervision training to RTCs and run the CTC as a resource center. Due to the huge&#13;
distances in Indonesia, distance learning techniques are also utilized. Computer-based training is in the&#13;
later stages of development as a continuing process. On average, each employee received 2.8 days of&#13;
job-related training compared to 6.5 days of Singapore Telecom. The ongoing projects provide adequate&#13;
resources to raise the period of job-related training.&#13;
Billing and Collection&#13;
3.7       TELKOM's billing performance is satisfactory. Bills are issued monthly and within 10 days&#13;
after the cut-off date. Billing is fully computerized and processing is done at regional billing centers. To&#13;
facilitate the subscribers' payment at any payment point, TELKOM has developed an Integrated Service&#13;
and Billing System (ISBS). ISBS is an on line system, which allows direct access to billing information&#13;
and input of payment advice from all participating payment points, including the post office (PERUM&#13;
POS DAN GIRO). ISBS has been implemented in Denpasar, Bandung, Solo, Ujung Pandang and&#13;
Jakarta.&#13;
3.8       With the number of subscribers increasing rapidly, TELKOM has introduced phased billing&#13;
in most WITELs and plans to implement it in all WITELs by the end of 1995. As the number of&#13;
subscribers increase, TELKOM proposes to increase the number of phases. The CNAS software system&#13;
which is being financed under the Third Telecommunications Project includes the requirement for a new&#13;
billing system which will facilitate real time billing. In addition, the new system should provide detailed&#13;
billing to improve TELKOM's service to customers and its knowledge of customer calling habits for&#13;
marketing, planning and financial analysis.&#13;
3.9       Overall collection performance is satisfactory.  The receivables in respect of private&#13;
subscribers continues to be satisfactory and maintained at around the equivalent of one and half months&#13;
of the annual billing. The receivables for GOI subscriber, which accounts for about 7 percent of total&#13;
annual revenue, have been maintained at around two months' billing since 1992.&#13;
Accounting and Financial Management Systems&#13;
3.10      TELKOM's accounting system, introduced in early 1989, and the computerization of the&#13;
general ledger have helped to reduce substantially the time required to prepare annual corporate accounts&#13;
and audits which are now completed within two months of the end of the fiscal year. TELKOM has&#13;
continued to improve its accounting policies and systems and has revised a number of accounting&#13;
policies, such as depreciation, amortization, capitalization of costs and treatment of retained earnings, to&#13;
be in line with US GAAP and new improved Indonesia accounting standards as part of its preparation to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
access the capital markets. TELKOM is in the process of modifying its financial and accounting systems&#13;
to implement these changes.&#13;
3.11      TELKOM  recognizes the need to produce more accurate, detailed information on both&#13;
costing and revenue in a timely manner for management decision-making and TELKOM's internal&#13;
procedures for preparing budgets and monitoring actual performances through better coordination and&#13;
participation by the various functional directorates and regional offices in the process, to enhance the&#13;
budget's value as a management tool. Since 1989, TELKOM has implemented actions to improve its&#13;
accounting practices, functions as well as coordination between its directorates and its regional offices in&#13;
budget preparation, and monitoring and evaluation of performance. In addition, technical assistance is&#13;
provided under the Fourth Telecommunications Project to review, recommend and implement the necessary&#13;
policies, systems and procedures as well as the appropriate organizational setup to carry out the necessary&#13;
financial accounting and management functions, with special emphasis in management, cost accounting and&#13;
treasury functions. Based on the consultants' recommendations, TELKOM decided to restructure its&#13;
financial functions at headquarters and the regional offices. The main objective of new management and&#13;
organizational structure is to improve management planning and control through the focus of the&#13;
organization on corporate goals. The consultants are finalizing the function descriptions for the new&#13;
structure which is expected to be implemented during 1995. Any additional technical assistance required&#13;
beyond the consulting assignment financed under the ongoing project will be financed through TELKOM's&#13;
own funds.&#13;
Audit&#13;
3.12      TELKOM's accounts are being audited by the state auditors (BPKP) in accordance with&#13;
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The auditor's opinion with respect to TELKOM's accounts since 1989&#13;
accounts have been unqualified. As a result of joint efforts by TELKOM and BPKP, the time required for&#13;
completing TELKOM's audits has been reduced significantly over the last five years. For 1994, the audited&#13;
accounts were finalized within two months after the close of its fiscal year as compared to fourteen months&#13;
for 1989 audited accounts. To prepare for access to the capital markets, TELKOM has employed&#13;
international certified auditors to audit its past three years' financial accounts and will continue to employ&#13;
international certified auditors to audit its annual financial accounts. During negotiations, it was agreed that&#13;
commencing June 30, 1996 TELKOM would furnish to the Bank its unaudited and audited financial&#13;
accounts within four and six months, respectively, of the close of the fiscal year.&#13;
Information Systems&#13;
3.13      TELKOM is expected to experience significant structural changes and a significant increase&#13;
in customer lines by the end of REPELITA VI. The increase in the customer base, as well as the&#13;
increasingly sophisticated enhancement to telecommunications services, will necessitate a more&#13;
sophisticated information system than that existing today to effectively manage this growth. Indeed, as&#13;
more competition is introduced, and as more business support system solutions are introduced, there is&#13;
an urgent need for synchronizing business plans and its mechanisms to ensure data integrity,&#13;
concurrency, availability, and security. TELKOM has prepared a comprehensive information plan under&#13;
the ongoing project which is supported under the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
Background&#13;
4.1    Over the last years, GOI has been actively pursuing efficiency improvements in the&#13;
telecommunications sector through a series of policy measures covering successively corporatization and&#13;
commercialization of TELKOM, new entry, partial privatization of INDOSAT and the planned partial&#13;
privatization of TELKOM. Overall, these policy initiatives have been successful and performance of the&#13;
sector has continued to improve (para. 1.11). The GOI, however, recognizes that further gains can be&#13;
made through expanded private sector participation. The new regulations (para. 1.28) provide the&#13;
enabling environment for greater and effective private sector participation in the telecommunications&#13;
sector. Until now, the role of the private sector has been limited to construction of network facilities&#13;
only (para. 1.28). The thrust of the proposed project, and the dialogue associated with this preparation,&#13;
has been to involve the private sector in activities which have hitherto been the domain of the public&#13;
sector.&#13;
Project Obiectives&#13;
4.2        The main objectives of the proposed project are to assist GOI in the implementation of the&#13;
long-term sector development program for its telecommunications sector aimed at enhancing its&#13;
international competitiveness through: (a) the formulation and implementation of a sectoral legal and&#13;
regulatory framework; and (b) modemization of Indonesia's telecommunications services and network.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
4.3       The proposed project to be implemented during 1995-1997 is a self contained, balanced and&#13;
integrated package of high priority components to support: (a) GOI's reform agenda; and (b) TELKOM's&#13;
1994-1998 investment program. Specific components of the projects are outlined below. Details of the&#13;
project components and the source of financing are given in Annex 13 and illustrated in Maps No. 26332&#13;
and 26333. The project includes the following components:&#13;
(a)    Policy Component: fully financed by the Bank, would provide policy support and&#13;
capacity building including: (i) reviewing and developing as appropriate the&#13;
telecommunications legal and regulatory environment to ensure effective entry of private&#13;
investors and operators in the telecommunications sector; (ii) strengthening MTPT's&#13;
capability to manage regulatory issues including monitoring and evaluating operators'&#13;
performance in the emerging multi-operator environment, and training of MTPT staff;&#13;
(iii) reviewing the management and allocation of radio frequency spectrum management&#13;
to ensure efficient use of the spectrum and appropriate use of modern technology; and&#13;
(iv) developing a plan for the provision of rural telephone services on a commercial&#13;
basis. During negotiations, terms of references for the consultancy assignments were&#13;
agreed and GOI agreed that the consultants will be appointed by June 30, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
(b)    Technical Assistance Component:  fully financed by TELKOM, would support (i)&#13;
strengthening the project implementation, marketing customer services and managerial&#13;
capacities of TELKOM through the provision of specialized marketing and managerial&#13;
services; and (ii) improving TELKOM's managerial capabilities through the&#13;
implementation of its ongoing restructuring program. The request for proposals for the&#13;
consultancy assignments have been issued and TELKOM agreed that the consultants will&#13;
be appointed by January 31, 1996.&#13;
(c)   Investment Component:  partly financed by the Bank to be implemented over three&#13;
years (1995-97), would support further improvements in quantity and quality of service&#13;
and network modernization, including: (i) installation of local and inter-exchange&#13;
networks based on the latest technology to utilize effectively an additional one million&#13;
lines of switching capacity in Jakarta and Surabaya; (ii) installation of a second fiber&#13;
optic backbone system between Jakarta and Surabaya; (iii) installation of submarine&#13;
optical fiber cable transmission systems to upgrade transmission facilities to Kalimantan&#13;
and Sulawesi; and (iv) enhancement of information systems to improve TELKOM's&#13;
business processes.&#13;
The project complements and supports the JOS operations through which private investors and operators&#13;
will install a minimum of two million additional telephone lines and operate both the new and existing&#13;
network in the regions outside Jakarta and Surabaya under stringent performance requirements (para&#13;
1.17). As a result of these and other initiatives, Indonesia's telephone density will increase from about&#13;
1.26 in 1994 to 3.5 per 100 inhabitants at the end of REPELITA VI in 1999.&#13;
TELKOM'S Investment Program.&#13;
4.4       TELKOM's 1994-1998 investment program is estimated at Rp. 13,207 billion (US $6,274&#13;
million equivalent) with a foreign component of Rp.6,270 billion (US $2,979 million equivalent). In&#13;
addition, private sector investments are estimated to be about US $3.0 billion, of which US $1.5 billion is&#13;
outside Java and Sumatra thus, supporting the GOI's objective of achieving a more balanced inter-&#13;
regional equity (para 1.17). The investment under the different components of the program and annual&#13;
investment during FY1994-98 are given in Annex 14.  The Bank reviewed the composition of the&#13;
investment program and the methodology for determining it and was satisfied that the program was&#13;
justified to meet growing demand and to ensure a balanced development of Indonesia's&#13;
telecommunications sector.  However, based on revised demand forecast (para.2.1), TELKOM's&#13;
investments for 1998 and thereafter will need to be revised to meet the increased demand.&#13;
Project Cost&#13;
4.5       The total cost of the project is estimated at Rp.3,097 billion (US $1,412.6 million&#13;
equivalent), with a foreign component both direct and indirect of Rp.1,903 billion (US $867.8 million&#13;
equivalent). Project costs are summarized in Table 4.1.&#13;
4.6       The project cost estimate was prepared by TELKOM with the assistance of consultants. The&#13;
estimates have been prepared based on price quotations recently obtained by TELKOM for similar&#13;
projects in Indonesia and vendor inputs. Except for a value added tax of ten percent of the total cost, the&#13;
cost estimates are net of duties and taxes since all imports under the project are duty free. Physical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
contingencies are based on 5 percent for equipment, services and civil works. Price contingencies for&#13;
foreign costs are based on projected increases of 2.2 percent p.a. in 1995, and each year thereafter. Price&#13;
contingencies for local costs are based on projected increases of 5.0 percent in 1995 and each year&#13;
thereafter.&#13;

a\  Local Currency portion includes VAT (USD1 17.9 millions).&#13;
4.8       Bank Financing. TELKOM, following the Bank's advice, has decided to exploit emerging&#13;
technologies such as fiber optic in the local loop so as to be able to deliver a wide range of information&#13;
services and wide-band telecommunications services to modern business enterprises and residential end-&#13;
users. GOI believes that the Bank's continued involvement in financing such large scale state of the art&#13;
technology equipment is crucial, first for the preparation of the technical specifications, and second, for&#13;
advice on the evaluation and selection process which will ensure that GOI gets the best technology at the&#13;
lowest price. The proposed Bank loan will partly finance outside plant network to modernize customer&#13;
access through optical fiber networks and fully finance technical assistance, including consultancy and&#13;
training for MTPT. In addition, the Bank will finance the submarine optic cable transmission systems. A&#13;
total of four contracts are proposed for Bank financing: (a) fiber optic customer access network; (b)&#13;
submarine fiber optic cable systems for (i) Surabaya-Banjarmasin-Ujung Pandang; and (ii)&#13;
Pangkalpinang-Pontianak; (c) SDH junction network; and (d) technical assistance for MTPT.&#13;
4.9       On-Lending. The proposed Bank loan of US$325 will finance about 23 percent of the total&#13;
financing requirements for the project. The proposed Bank loan would be made to the Republic of&#13;
Indonesia at the Bank's standard variable interest rate for a 20 year term including five years of grace.&#13;
GOI will on lend the proceeds of the Bank loan, except for US $8.0 million for technical assistance to&#13;
MTPT for sector management, to TELKOM under a subsidiary loan agreement (SLA). The SLA will be&#13;
denominated in equivalent US dollars, and the onlending interest rate will be under the same terms as the&#13;
Bank's loan plus 0.5 percent per annum for a 20-year term including five years grace period. The&#13;
foreign exchange risk will be borne by TELKOM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
4.10      Cofinancing. The loan of US $264.0 million (equivalent) from OECF Japan will finance&#13;
regional telecommunications development in Jakarta and Surabaya. Funding from EXIM Bank Japan of&#13;
US$41.0 million (equivalent) will finance 213,000 line units of switching equipment. The loan of US&#13;
$95.0 million equivalent from KfW, already effective, will finance 341,000 line units of switching&#13;
equipment and associated inter exchange optic network and remote area network. The US $62.0 million&#13;
loan from France, also effective, will finance the cost of (a) the backbone transmission systems in Java&#13;
for the northern route (Jakarta-Surabaya); (b) rural area Phase 4. In addition, USA loan (US$42.0&#13;
million from Exim Bank) already effective, will finance 206,000 line units of switching equipment and&#13;
associated facilities in Jakarta and Surabaya.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
4.11      Goods and Works. The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3. All goods&#13;
and works to be funded under the Bank loan will be procured by international competitive bidding (ICB)&#13;
in accordance with "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the&#13;
Bank in January 1995. The use of Bank's standard bidding documents for goods and works will be&#13;
mandatory with such modifications as the Bank may agree to be necessary for the purposes of the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.12      Technical Assistance and Consultancy. Selection of consultants for all assignments will&#13;
be made on a competitive basis from a short list of firms or experts for each assignment agreed on by the&#13;
Bank and under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank following the Bank Guidelines for the&#13;
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981.&#13;
4.13      A total of three contracts is proposed for Bank financing and the schedule of procurement&#13;
actions is in Annex 15. In the procurement of equipment under ICB, domestic manufacturers will be&#13;
eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of either 15 percent or the import duty whichever is lower. All&#13;
bidding packages for training over $100,000 equivalent, for consulting firms over $100,000 equivalent&#13;
and individual consultants exceeding $50,000 equivalent financed by the Bank would be subject to&#13;
Bank's prior review. All Bank-financed contracts for goods and works will be subject to prior review,&#13;
which will cover 100 percent of the contract value. Procurement of goods and services financed by co-&#13;
financiers will be in accordance with co-financiers' procurement guidelines. All major goods and&#13;
services to be procured with TELKOM's own internal resources will be through local competitive&#13;
bidding following the GOI regulations Keppres 16.&#13;
4.14      Advance Procurement Action.  To ensure timely project implementation, TELKOM has&#13;
initiated advance procurement actions: (a) announced the general procurement notice for the proposed&#13;
project in the November 1994 Development Business; and (b) selected in August 1994 consultants for&#13;
engineering designs and construction management of the proposed project. TELKOM furnished to the&#13;
Bank the following bid documents prepared in accordance with Bank standard bidding documents for the&#13;
two major components: (a) fiber optic customer access network, and (b) fiber optic submarine cable&#13;
systems for (i) Surabaya - Banjarmasin - Ujung Pandang; and (ii) Pangkalpinang - Pontianak. The Bank&#13;
has reviewed and cleared the technical bidding documents.&#13;

is expected to be faster than the average Bank profile in Indonesia because of the advance procurement&#13;
activity initiated for the three major components of the project. Although physical construction of the&#13;
project would be completed by end 1998, the implementation of all aspects would be completed by&#13;
December 31, 2000. The closing date of the Bank loan will be June 30, 2001.&#13;

b\   Amount includes physical and price contingencies.&#13;
4.16       Special Account.  In order to facilitate disbursements, a Special Account for MTPT in an&#13;
amount of US$500,000 will be established. This amount will be deposited in Bank Indonesia on terms&#13;
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. This Special Account will be held in the name of the Director&#13;
General of Budget, Ministry of Finance, following established procedures. The Special Account would&#13;
be used for consultants and training for MTPT. Replenishment to the Special Account will be made on a&#13;
monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever occurs first. TELKOM&#13;
indicated that while it does not require a special account, it has agreed to ensure that withdrawal&#13;
applications, prior to submission to the Bank, will be aggregated in amounts of US $1,000,000 equivalent&#13;
or more using direct payment or reimbursement procedures. These procedures were discussed and&#13;
agreed on during negotiations.&#13;
4.17       Site Acquisition. To ensure smooth and timely implementation of the project, TELKOM&#13;
has completed acquisition of all sites for housing network facilities and rights of way for cable routes.&#13;
There are no resettlement issues under this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
Implementation&#13;
4.18      To ensure effective project management, track emerging issues and address them in a timely&#13;
way, TELKOM has established a project implementation unit (PROTEL V) headed by a Project Director,&#13;
with overall responsibility for project implementation, reporting to the Director of Development.&#13;
Appointment of the unit head and key staff members has already been made. The PROTEL V has been&#13;
given adequate financial and administrative autonomy to enable it to discharge its responsibilities&#13;
effectively, have its own accounting, procurement, transport, land acquisition, administrative and&#13;
technical sections, and keep separate and distinct project accounts for the Bank project as a whole as well&#13;
as its individual components. The critical path method will be used to coordinate implementation of the&#13;
project in order to minimize the level of non-performing investment. Technical assistance financed by&#13;
TELKOM is provided to assist PROTEL V in project implementation and supervision of the project&#13;
components. TELKOM's has agreed to request proposals from consultants prior to negotiations. Time&#13;
bound summary implementation plan is in Annex 17. During negotiations, assurances were obtained&#13;
from GOI and TELKOM to ensure:&#13;
(a)    commencing on November 30, 1995 and each year thereafter, GOI and TELKOM will&#13;
review with the Bank: (i) GOI's telecommunications sector development program&#13;
including the role of the private sector in accordance with the Policy Letter, (ii)&#13;
evaluation of TELKOM's performance in accordance with performance indicators, (iii)&#13;
assessment of business environment for private participation and progress in developing&#13;
the legal and regulatory framework, and (iv) review of TELKOM's investment program&#13;
to ensure consistency with GOI's sector development program and the Policy Letter to&#13;
achieve a balanced development of the regions and ensure implementation of&#13;
TELKOM's plans to increase self-financing from its operations; and&#13;
(b)    efficient project implementation, TELKOM will maintain the Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PROTEL V) for the Telecommunications Sector Modernization Project headed by&#13;
a qualified and experienced officer, and assigned, at all times, with such power,&#13;
responsibilities, funds, staffing facilities and other resources as shall be required to&#13;
undertake its responsibilities in carrying out the project.&#13;
4.19      Environment and Health Aspects. The use of environmentally friendly approaches will be&#13;
adopted to install conduits without surface excavation. Indeed, the net effect of the project is expected to&#13;
be positive on both environmental impact and health impact since it will result in a substitution of&#13;
environmentally benign communications for environmentally damaging transportation. In addition, it&#13;
will improve marginally the delivery of health services through better communications between health&#13;
units and with the population. However, given the volume of civil works related to the installing of&#13;
underground cables, there is likely to be some disruption to vehicular traffic and pedestrians. This will&#13;
be minimized by (a) planning and phasing of construction works; and (b) including in construction&#13;
contracts, clauses which require contractors to maintain vehicular and pedestrian flows. The use of&#13;
environmentally friendly approaches will be adopted to install conduits without surface excavation. This&#13;
will minimize vehicular and pedestrian traffic disruption while laying cables for local networks. The&#13;
long distance fiber optic cables will be buried mostly along existing roads and river crossings, so no&#13;
disruption of virgin land is expected.  Laying of submarine cable is not expected to cause any&#13;
environmental problems. Therefore, the project has been given a 'B' environmental rating. No&#13;
resettlement issues are expected. BAPEDAL by its letter dated August 25, 1994 has issued the&#13;
environmental clearance for the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Performance Monitoring and Supervision.&#13;
4.20      Performance Indicators. Performance indicators to monitor TELKOM's implementation of&#13;
the physical components of the investment program, the quality of service and productivity are given in&#13;
Annex 7. During negotiations, the proposed performance targets for the years 1995 and 1996 were&#13;
discussed and agreed with GOI and TELKOM. Assurances were also obtained from GOI and TELKOM&#13;
that (a) the indicative targets for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 will be reviewed and specific targets for&#13;
each year agreed with the Bank by November 15 of the preceding year; and (b) within six months of the&#13;
end of each of TELKOM's fiscal year until the completion of the Project, prepare and submit to the&#13;
Bank, for its review, a progress implementation report, indicating the actions taken by TELKOM to meet&#13;
such indicators..&#13;
4.21      Performance Reporting. PROTEL V will be required to prepare and submit a quarterly&#13;
report in an agreed format to the Bank on the status of the project and compare the actual perfornance&#13;
against the agreed on indicators. This report will be the main instrument for monitoring project&#13;
accomplishments and will include the proposed pipeline of sub-projects, and implementation status of&#13;
contracted sub-projects. The PROTEL V will maintain separate project accounts and technical audits in a&#13;
form satisfactory to the Bank for annual audits. These accounts will be audited annually by an&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank and will include opinions on all expenditures. The PROTEL&#13;
V will submit the audited accounts and technical audits to the Bank no later than six months after the&#13;
close of each fiscal year. Within six months of the closing of the proposed loan, TELKOM will prepare&#13;
and furnish to the Bank a detailed Implementation Completion Report.&#13;
4.22      Supervision Plan.  Supervision of this project will focus upon a number of sector&#13;
optimization and institutional development activities. These measures will include: (a) continuing the&#13;
ongoing dialogue with GOI to implement appropriate sector modernization and optimization to improve&#13;
sector performance and human resource development; (b) initiate discussion on efficient usage of&#13;
telephones through tariff rebalancing; (c) improving access to telephone service through increased use of&#13;
public pay phones and telecommunications service retail shops; (d) improving emphasis on servicing&#13;
corporate customers through strengthened Customer Service Groups. Based on past experience, front-&#13;
end loading of supervision resources, particularly during the first two years of project implementation, is&#13;
necessary to resolve basic physical implementation issues. Two mission will be needed each year as&#13;
adequate supervision of this project. The total estimated staff inputs are: (a) telecommunications&#13;
regulation and policy specialist; (b) telecommunications engineer; (c) financial analyst; (d) organization&#13;
and human resource specialist; (e) telecommunications lawyer; and (f) an MIS expert. A total of 90&#13;
staff weeks effort in the field will be required for effective supervision of this project and another 90&#13;
staff weeks will be required at Headquarters. The Bank's supervision plan is in Annex 16.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
5.2       During 1990 to 1994 period, the network grew by over 20 percent p.a.; the call completion&#13;
rate for long distance improved from 19 percent to 36 percent; domestic traffic grew by about 25 percent&#13;
p.a.; and labor productivity improved from 20 to 50 lines per employee. These improved performance&#13;
have enabled TELKOM to maintain satisfactory financial performance despite the low utilization of its&#13;
installed capacity (para 2.4). During the same period, profit increased from Rp. 130 billion to Rp. 418&#13;
billion; net internal cash generation from around 24 percent of average capital investment to 58 percent;&#13;
debt service coverage from 2.1 to 4.3; and return on average equity improved from 8 percent to 16&#13;
percent. Accelerated depreciation method used by TELKOM underestimate its financial performance as&#13;
operating ratio tends to be higher and the rate of return lower when compared with other telecoms&#13;
operators which use straight line depreciation.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and&#13;
amortization as a percentage of revenue (EBITDA) is a more appropriate measure of performance to&#13;
compare with other telecoms operators because it eliminates differences which arise due to differences in&#13;
depreciation policies, capital structure, interest rates and taxation and is thus used as a comparative&#13;
measure within the investment community. TELKOM's EBITDA/ revenue during the period remain 60&#13;
percent, which is better than most telecoms operating companies and is comparable with Telekom&#13;
Malaysia's 62 percent and Singapore Telecom's 57 percent for 1993.&#13;
5.3       TELKOM's Financial Position: TELKOM's financial and liquidity positions remained&#13;
sound during the 1990-94 period. TELKOM's financial position as shown by its audited balance sheet as&#13;
of December 31, 1994 is summarized in Table 5.2. TELKOM's financial position is sound with a debt&#13;
equity ratio of 53:47 and liquidity is strong with a current ratio of 1.5.&#13;

5.4       TELKOM's  Projected  Financial  Performance:  TELKOM's estimated financial&#13;
performance based on TELKOM's approved budget for 1995 and projections through 1999 are&#13;
summarized in Table 5.3. TELKOM's financial performance is projected on the basis of assumptions&#13;
shown in Annex 20. From 1996, private sector through JOS agreements will be responsible for&#13;
investment of the new network and management of the existing and new network in five out of seven&#13;
operating regions. The annual revenue contribution by the JOS to TELKOM for managing the existing&#13;
network and the initial investor payment are estimated based on the March 21, 1995 bid opening results.&#13;
In addition, the JOS investors will contribute a share of the distributable revenue (i.e. gross revenue net&#13;
of cash operating cost of the total network and annual guaranteed revenue contribution) to TELKOM. In&#13;
line with the objectives of the GOI to ensure that the benefits of efficiency gain will be equitably shared&#13;
between customers and investors (para. 1.23), it is assumed that call and installation charges are&#13;
reduced annually by 5 percent and 25 percent, respectively, commencing from 1997. Detailed financial&#13;
performance indicators and financial projections are provided in Annex 7 and Annex 21, respectively.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
5.5       TELKOM's performance is expected to improve because of the overall productivity&#13;
improvements due to the involvement of foreign operators in the JOS scheme beginning in 1996 and&#13;
TELKOM's exclusive focus on Jakarta and Surabaya regions and long distance. As shown in Table 5.3,&#13;
TELKOM's net profit is expected to increase from Rp. 472 billion in 1995 to Rp. 1,397 billion by 1999.&#13;
Return on average equity is expected to improve from 15 percent for 1995 to 23 percent for 1999. The&#13;
ratio of net internal cash generation to average capital investment is projected to increase from 55&#13;
percent to around 90 percent during the projection period. During negotiations, it was agreed with&#13;
TELKOM that it will (a) not incur any additional debt unless a reasonable forecast of its net revenue&#13;
after expenditures for each fiscal year during the term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.5 times&#13;
the projected debt service requirements; and (b) take all necessary measures to achieve for each of its&#13;
fiscal years, funds from internal sources after debt service, working capital needs , and dividend&#13;
payments and contributions equivalent to not less than 50% of its annual average of TELKOM's capital&#13;
expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, for that year and the following fiscal year.&#13;
5.6       During the projection period, TELKOM's financial position is expected to remain sound&#13;
with the debt equity ratio reaching better than the GOI authorized limit of 60:40. TELKOM's debt&#13;
service coverage ratio would be in excess of 3.0 throughout the projection period. TELKOM's current&#13;
ratio is expected to be above 1.0 throughout the projection period and to remain reasonable.&#13;
B. Economic Analysis&#13;
5.7       Least Cost Solution: TELKOM's investment program (para. 4.4) is the least-cost solution&#13;
for providing planned service levels within the constraints imposed by the existing configuration and&#13;
technology of the telecommunications network. Similarly, the JOS investment program will be required&#13;
to confirm under the JOS construction agreement that it is the least cost-solution for providing planned&#13;
services. The timing and dimensioning of various elements of investment in the system as well as design&#13;
and composition of alternative network configurations are the results of careful analyses made by&#13;
TELKOM in close cooperation with consultants financed under the Bank's ongoing projects. These&#13;
techno-economic analyses are based on internationally recognized engineering practices.&#13;
5.8       Project Benefits: The proposed project will support the implementation of an ongoing reform&#13;
agenda with profound effect on market structure, service coverage and regulatory environment, all aimed at&#13;
bringing the performance of the Indonesian telecommunications sector to international competitive levels.&#13;
The licensing of five consortia, each tied to a world-class telecommunications operator, to provide local&#13;
telephone services in five regions of Indonesia will generate dynamic effects towards increasing competition&#13;
in various market segments and developing an effective regulatory environment. The award of these&#13;
licenses to the private sector through a transparent and competitive bidding process, the establishment of&#13;
clearly defined performance targets for service quality throughout the country and the establishment of&#13;
effective performance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms not only will contribute to the development&#13;
of high quality low cost telecommunication systems throughout Indonesia, but also establish a framework&#13;
approach as precedent for emulation in other Indonesian infrastructure sectors. Likewise, other elements of&#13;
the reform agenda, i.e. the review of the Telecommunications Law, planned partial privatization of&#13;
TELKOM, and the development of pilot projects for improved delivery of rural telephone services, will&#13;
each contribute to improved sector performance. Taken together, these various elements of reform will lead&#13;
to a substantially increased role for the private sector, a more competitive TELKOM and the evolution of a&#13;
multi-operator environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
5.9       Rate of Return: Based on the assumptions summarized in Annex 20, the economic rate of&#13;
return (ERR) is estimated at 33 percent (see Annex 22). The ERR is based on the financial benefits and&#13;
costs directly associated with the proposed project, excluding corporate taxes, that is the addition of one&#13;
million lines of capacity during the project period (1995-97) in Jakarta and Surabaya regions. The&#13;
capital cost is adjusted by excluding the value added tax of 10 percent levied and revenue is adjusted by&#13;
including the value added tax of 10 percent. Although the implementation of the physical component&#13;
does not present any significant risks, the sensitivity of ERR estimate with respect to the effects of the&#13;
following scenarios were considered:&#13;
(a)    a delay of 12 months in connection of new subscribers resulting in a delayed revenue&#13;
stream of 12 months would result in a fall in ERR to about 20 percent;&#13;
(b)    an increase in capital cost by 10 percent would result in a fall in ERR to 28 percent;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)    combining (a) and (b) would result in a fall of ERR to 18 percent.&#13;
Even under the most improbable scenario, (c), the project would be acceptable. Furthermore, each of&#13;
these estimates underestimates the true ERR because they do not include: (a) any improvements in the&#13;
existing network performance due to the project; (b) estimates of consumer surplus; and (c) the major&#13;
productivity and quality improvements expected to follow from the JOS initiative.&#13;
5.10      Project Risks:  Based on the past successful experience with Bank projects, the&#13;
implementation of the physical components by TELKOM and achievement of the benefits associated&#13;
with it essentially does not present any significant risks. However, there are risks in the implementation&#13;
of the reform program in respect of: (i) transparency of selection and award process of the JOS; and (ii)&#13;
incentives for efficiency improvements, achievement of performance targets and sharing benefits with&#13;
customers. The quality of the requests for proposals (RFP), issued to 12 pre-qualified consortia, and the&#13;
process to respond to bidders' questions and opening of bids (on March 21, 1995) in the presence of&#13;
representatives of all bidders, have demonstrated MTPT's commitment to a transparent selection and&#13;
award process. Similarly, the GOI has signaled in the clarification to the RFP that the GOI's overriding&#13;
objective in proceeding with the JOS is to bring the provision of telecommunications services in all parts&#13;
of Indonesia up to internationally competitive levels in terms of range of services, availability, quality,&#13;
and price. Thus, the GOI has linked explicitly the justification of reform to performance improvements&#13;
and customer benefits.  Specifically, in reviewing tariff proposals from JOS operators, the GOI will&#13;
eschew a "cost-plus" approach by using the highest efficiency performance in the sector in Indonesia and&#13;
in other competitor countries in the region as benchmarks.&#13;

after expenditures for each fiscal year during the term of the debt to be incurred shall&#13;
be at least 1.5 times the projected debt service requirements; and (ii) take all necessary&#13;
measures to achieve for each of its fiscal years, funds from internal sources after debt&#13;
service, working capital needs, and dividend payments and contributions equivalent to&#13;
not less than 50% of its annual average of TELKOM's capital expenditures incurred,&#13;
or expected to be incurred, for that year and the following fiscal year (para 5.5).&#13;

Ref. :    Indonesia Telecommunications Modernization Project&#13;
(Policy Letter)&#13;
Date      Jakarta, April 13 1995&#13;
Mr. Vice President&#13;
East Asia &amp; Pacific Region&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
Washington DC&#13;
Dear Sir,&#13;
I am writing to you, in the context of the processing by The World Bank of The&#13;
Indonesia Telecommunications Modernization Project, to provide the Bank with&#13;
the government's strategy for the development of the telecommunications sector&#13;
in Indonesia.&#13;
Background&#13;
Indonesia's basic goals for the development of the telecommunications sector are&#13;
based on the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia and Law No. 3 of&#13;
1989, and are described in the Outlines of State Policy (Garis-garis Besar Haluan&#13;
Negara or GBHN) promulgated by the People's Consultative Assembly in March&#13;
1993 to guide the formulation of the Sixth Medium Term (Five Year) Develop-&#13;
ment Plan (Repelita VI). The GBHN highlights the importance of rapidly devel-&#13;
oping an efficient telecommunications sector to meet the needs of the Indonesian&#13;
economy.&#13;
The Government of Indonesia recognizes that telecommunications networks (like&#13;
other public infrastructures) have very important effects on the productivity and&#13;
competitiveness of the national economy. They therefore make a vital contribu-&#13;
tion not only to export competitiveness in the increasingly globalized market&#13;
economy, but also to the success of national development. As economic activities&#13;
in almost all sectors become increasingly information intensive, adequate, reli-&#13;
able and efficient telecommunications networks and services become critical to&#13;
the ability of firms to conduct business and compete in the global economy. In&#13;
Indonesia, telecommunications is now becoming an integral part of financial&#13;
services, commodities market, media, transportation and tourism, and provides&#13;
vital links among manufacturers, wholesalers and customers. Telecommunica-&#13;
tions constitute the core of, and provide the infrastructure for, the information&#13;
economy as a whole. Therefore, the government is committed to addressing&#13;
sector constraints to ensure that inadequate access to modern communications&#13;
will not impede the participation of Indonesia in the global economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
Given the importance of telecommunications for the competitiveness and perfor-&#13;
mance of thelndonesian economy as a whole, the telecommunications sector has&#13;
been an important priority for the government in recent years. Partly on the&#13;
basis of the important assistance  from   and collaboration with the   Bank,&#13;
TELKOM   achieved impressive performance improvement over the period 1988&#13;
- 1994. The rate of network growth increased from 8% p.a to over 20% p.a.;&#13;
!abor productivity improved by 125% from 20 to 48 lines per employee; annual&#13;
investment increased by 200% from about $ 340 million to over $ 1 billion, with&#13;
TELKOM currently self-financing over 50% of investment; and TELKOM was&#13;
recently able to have the audit of its account completed within 2 months com-&#13;
pared with over 14 months in 1988.&#13;
Although telephone service penetration rates in Indonesia doubled over the period&#13;
1988 - 1994, from 0.5 to 1.4 telephone lines per 100 persons, they are neverthe-&#13;
less the lowest of the ASEAN countries, with Singapore at 42 lines per 100&#13;
persons, Malaysia 12, Thailand 3, and Philippines 2. Furthermore, TELKOM's&#13;
uality of service remains oor with low call completion rates of approximately&#13;
50 % for local calls and 35 % for national long distance-calls, and staffing levels&#13;
remain high. Additionally, the call completion rates for and market development&#13;
of cellular telephone services have been unsatisfactory. Thus, in spite of the&#13;
impressive improvements in TELKOM's performance outlined above, very sig-&#13;
nificant progress, in terms of network expansion, quality of service, and produc-&#13;
tivity, stl7l need to be achieved. An on-going reform agenda is there ore required.&#13;
Government Objectives and Strategy&#13;
The overall government objective for the telecommunications sector is to support&#13;
the international competitiveness of the Indonesian economy as a whole by bring-&#13;
ing the provision of telecommunications services in all parts of Indonesia up to&#13;
internationally competitive levels in terms of availability, range, quality and&#13;
pricin. The specific government goals for the telecommunications sector during&#13;
REPELITA V1(1994- 1999) are to substantially reduce or eliminate unmet&#13;
demand for services by constructing a minimum of 5 million additional lines,&#13;
greatly improve access to services in rural areas, bring TELKOM's operations up&#13;
to world-class standards, and rapidly improve the performance of the cellular&#13;
mobile telephone market segment.&#13;
As a result of government initiatives that have already been taken, the sector is&#13;
going through a period of very substantial change from one of almost total state&#13;
monopoly of basic sevices to one characterized by an emerging competitive,&#13;
multi-operator environment, substantial private investment and dramatic im-&#13;
provements in TELKOM's performance. Key sector reform initiatives have&#13;
included:&#13;
(a)  Conversion in 1991 of TELKOM's status from a "perum" state corporation&#13;
to a limited liability "PT" company and implementation of an on-going&#13;
program of commercialization and performance improvement;&#13;
(b)  Proclamation in 1993 of a decree that significantly expanded the scope for&#13;
private participation in the provision of basic services, including joint&#13;
ventures and joint operations between TELKOM or INDOSAT and the&#13;
private sector;&#13;
&#13;

(c)  Authorizing in 1993 PT. SATELINDO, a majority privately-owned joint&#13;
venture with TELKOM and PT. INDOSAT, to provide satellite, national&#13;
GSM cellular telephone and international telecommunications services.&#13;
SATELINDO commenced service in November 1994;&#13;
(d)  Authorizing in 1993 PT. RATELINDO, also a majority privately-owned&#13;
joint venture with TELKOM, to provide basic local telephone services in&#13;
Jakarta and Bandung using wireless technology. With significant invest-&#13;
ment from the Netherlands PTT,' good progress is being made on plans to&#13;
install over 250.000 lines--probably the largest wireless local telephone&#13;
service project in Asia. RATELINDO is expected to commence service&#13;
provision by mid-1995;&#13;
(e)  The partial privatization of PT. INDOSAT in October 1994 through a very&#13;
successful, well-planned and professionally managed initial public offering.&#13;
As a result, 35% of INDOSAT is now owned by private investors.&#13;
The provision of telecommunications terminal equipment and value added servic-&#13;
es has also been fully privatized along with the provision of public card phones&#13;
and paging radio services. TELKOM has entered into several other joint ventures&#13;
with the private sector for the provision of cellular and VSAT satellite networks&#13;
for private use.&#13;
In addition to these measures, the government is currently implementing a vigor-&#13;
ous reform agenda to further improve the performance of the sector. This invol-&#13;
ves an influx of 'rivate capital investment linked to foreign operator expertise&#13;
through large-scafe Joint Operation Schemes with TELKOM, increased competi-&#13;
tion, organizational restructuring of TELKOM, planned partial privatization of&#13;
TELKOM through an issue of shares to the public, and a review of the telecom-&#13;
munications legal enviroment. More specifically, the government is taking the&#13;
following initiatives:&#13;
(a)  Joint Operation Schemes. The government is moving quickly to establish&#13;
large scale " Build-Joint Operate-Transfer" schemes. These schemes in-&#13;
volve the construction during REPELITA VI of approximately two million&#13;
additional lines (with a capital cost of approximately US 52 billion) by&#13;
private consortia that include first-class foreign operators, and subsequent&#13;
operation of local network facilities in five out of TELKOM's seven oper-&#13;
ating regions by the new joint operation management. Requests for prop-&#13;
sals to the twelve pre-qualified consortia were issued in November 1994.&#13;
The selection of the winning bidders from this competitive process is tar-&#13;
geted for May 1995 or earlier;&#13;
(b)  Reorganization  of TELKOM. A  comprehensive  reorganization  of&#13;
TELKOM is being undertaken. This involves reducing the number of&#13;
TELKOM's operating divisions from twelve to seven, establishing a sepa-&#13;
rate national network division establishing a much smaller corporate of-&#13;
fice, and reorganizing TELKOIM's non-core activities;&#13;
(c) Initial Public Offering. Following the lead of INDOSAT, TELKOM will&#13;
have its own initial public offering of shares within one to two years. This&#13;
partial privatization will have the important effect of strengthening the&#13;
commercial enviroment and discipline for management;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;

(d)   Cellular Competition. In addition to the licences issued to SATELINDO&#13;
and RATELINDO in 1993, the government recently (in 1994) authorized a&#13;
second national GSM cellular system to be operated by PT. Telkomsel, a&#13;
joint venture between PT. TELKOM and PT. INDOSA'T. Operations have&#13;
started in Batam and Medan and now are being expanded to other regions.&#13;
The award of a second national GSM cellular licence is expected to lead to&#13;
a rapid improvement in the coverage and quality of cellular service;&#13;
(e)   Review of the  Legal Enviroment. MTPT  has   already initiated a pre-&#13;
liminary study for a review of6the laws and regulations that govern the&#13;
sector in order to assess what changes should be made to accommodate and&#13;
support the emerging competitive, multi-operator enviroment. Additional&#13;
reviews and development of proposals for a comr*letely revised and&#13;
modernized law will be undertaken as part of the Telecommunications&#13;
Modernization Project with the support of the Bank.&#13;
The JOS initiative referred to in (a) above has several important features:&#13;
*    The JOS have been structured to operate in five separate territories, which&#13;
are expected to be awarded to five separate investor kgroups each with an&#13;
experienced foreign telecommunications operator as a Key member;&#13;
*    The JOS packages are to be awarded after a careful pre-qualification&#13;
process on the basis of competitive bidding based on highly professional&#13;
requests for proposals documentation. This process will ensure all bidder&#13;
groups include highly qualified foreign operators and have demonstrated&#13;
capabilities to finance the package that they bid on;&#13;
*    The government has structured the ore-qualification process to expand the&#13;
investor groups significantly beyonc[ the small number of interested parties&#13;
who previously invested in the sector;&#13;
*    The private consortia who are awarded the JOS projects will be responsible&#13;
for the construction of the new lines and the subsequent operation of both&#13;
new and existing facilities;&#13;
*    Unlike the earlier revenue sharing arrangements for local network facili-&#13;
ties, under the JOS project the private investor groups will be accountable&#13;
for the achievment of demanding operational performance targets and will&#13;
be responsible for the appointment of the senior management team foriEe&#13;
]OS unit:&#13;
*    The JOS will run for longer periods than earlier revenue sharing arrange-&#13;
ments; they are expected to run from 13 to 17 years;&#13;
*    Neither the government nor TELKOM  will provide any financial guaran-&#13;
tees to the investor groups or their financiers;&#13;
*    The exclusivity provisions of the JOS contract will be carefully limited to&#13;
the JOS construction period (i.e. until 1999) and only for wireline and not&#13;
for wireless services, thereby leaving the government the discretion to&#13;
expand the scope of competition in the sector as it sees fit from time to&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6 2                              Annex 5&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
The government also recognizes that appropriate tariffs are a key element of&#13;
maintaining an environment in the sector that is attractive for investors, provides&#13;
incentives or efficiency, and protects the interests of customers, thereby contrib-&#13;
uting to the international competitiveness of the Indonesian economy. Therefore,&#13;
the government will review lTELKOM's tariff as necessary every three years.&#13;
The ractors that will be taken into account on a uniform national basis in review-&#13;
ing and authorizing tariff adjustments will include:&#13;
(a)   The principle that tariff adjustment should be cost-oriented in terms of the&#13;
highest efficiency performance ih comparable countries;&#13;
(b)  The avoidance of undue negative impact on the performance of TELKOM&#13;
and JOS units;&#13;
(c)  Increases or decreases required to reflect the impact of changes of more&#13;
than 10% in the value between the Rupiah and the US dollar;&#13;
(d)  The requirement for telecommunications operators in Indonesia to attract&#13;
capital for future construction and expansion; and&#13;
(e)   Promoting affordability of telecommunications services for Indonesian&#13;
consumers.&#13;
The magnitude of the transition that is underway in the Indonesian telecommuni-&#13;
cations sector is indicated by the fact that about 50 % of new investment in an&#13;
aggressive investment plan for the sector will be private investment. Further-&#13;
more, by the end of REPELITA VI, Indonesia may have one of the most com-&#13;
petitive telecommunications sectors in Asia, with some competition in all import-&#13;
ant market segments: terminals, basic local service (in particular through com-&#13;
petitive fixed wireless networks), pay phones, long-distance service, leased lines,&#13;
VSAT private networks, internationai services ana value-added services.&#13;
I trust the above explanation indicates the wide scope of the fundamental changes&#13;
the Government has initiated in the Indonesian telecommunications sector and&#13;
underlines our commitment to modernizing the sector in line with current gov-&#13;
ernment policies.&#13;
Sincerely,&#13;

1.     Summarv of the Joint Operation Schemes&#13;
The Joint Operations Schemes are cooperative ventures between TELKOM and&#13;
Investors. Investors are JVCs composed of private sector Indonesian entities such as companies,&#13;
small businesses and cooperatives as well as foreign entities such as experienced public&#13;
telecommunications operators. The main elements of the JOSs are as follows:&#13;
a)     The Investor will be responsible for the financing and construction on a turnkey&#13;
basis of the New Installation necessary to provide a prescribed minimum number&#13;
of Access Line Units within the JOS Territory. The New Installation will be&#13;
integrated with the Existing Installation to form a single integrated JOS System&#13;
within each Territory. These integrated systems will be operated by JOS Units&#13;
in each Territory during the applicable JOS Periods.&#13;
b)     JOS Units will operate for, on behalf of and in the name of TELKOM. Each of&#13;
the five JOS Units will operate as a TELKOM Regional Division. The JOS Unit&#13;
will be staffed by existing TELKOM employees in each Territory supplemented&#13;
by additional staff hired by the JOS management and management and expert&#13;
personnel placed by the Investor.&#13;
c)     TELKOM will be responsible for the monitoring and supervision of overall JOS&#13;
Operations to ensure that the objectives of the JOS are achieved. TELKOM will&#13;
appoint a non-executive Chairman for each JOS Unit to assist in performing&#13;
TELKOM's functions in this regard. All other management functions will be&#13;
delegated by TELKOM to the Investor who will appoint, supervise and be&#13;
responsible for the performance of the senior JOS management.&#13;
d)     The Investor will be held accountable for the achievement of specific operational&#13;
performance targets relating to the expansion and quality of telecommunications&#13;
services as well as the achievement of financial performance targets. Financial&#13;
sanctions will be established to ensure that both operational and financial&#13;
performance targets are met. In addition, financial and other penalties will be&#13;
established to ensure compliance with construction schedules, successful&#13;
completion of acceptance tests for facilities, and other obligations of Investors&#13;
related to the successful implementation of the JOS.&#13;
e)     The investor will be responsible for the appointment of the senior management&#13;
team of the JOS Unit, including the General Manager, the top three levels of&#13;
management and the Kandatel managers. The Investor will seek TELKOM's&#13;
approval before such candidates are appointed. If TELKOM fails to approve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65                                ANNEX.6&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
senior management candidates proposed by the Investor, the Investor shall&#13;
reconsider the candidate. If the Investor then wishes to proceed with the&#13;
appointment of the candidate, the Investor shall consult with TELKOM at the&#13;
JOS Consultation Forum (see below). After such consultation, the Investor may&#13;
withdraw the proposed candidate, or, after 30 days, proceed with the&#13;
appointment. The Investor will also have the responsibility for identifying and&#13;
recruiting key expert staff and consultants required for the JOS Unit.&#13;
f)     The Investor will exercise its best efforts to ensure that an Indonesian national is&#13;
appointed General Manager of the JOS. If the General Manager is an existing&#13;
TELKOM employee, he or she shall resign from TELKOM upon assuming the&#13;
position of General Manager. The Investor shall endeavor to hire Indonesian&#13;
nationals for other management positions wherever reasonably possible. The&#13;
majority of senior management positions shall, at all times during the JOS. be&#13;
filled by Indonesian nationals.&#13;
g)     A Committee known as the JOS Consultation Forum will be established for each&#13;
JOS. The Forum will be composed of an equal number of representatives of&#13;
TELKOM and the Investor, plus a Chairman appointed by the Minister. The&#13;
purpose of the Forum will be consultation and coordination between the Investor&#13;
and TELKOM on all matters relating to the JOS.&#13;
h)     Disputes between TELKOM and the Investor that cannot be resolved at the JOS&#13;
Consultation Forum will be dealt with as follows:&#13;
i)    major regulatory and policy issues relating to the fundamental nature of&#13;
the JOS will be referred to the Minister, who may settle them or refer&#13;
them to arbitration; and&#13;
ii)    all other issues, including technical and commercial issues shall be&#13;
settled by arbitration. Such issues shall initially be referred to the&#13;
Indonesian National Arbitration Board (BANI); however a party&#13;
dissatisfied by the award of first instance may refer the matter for final&#13;
settlement by arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of&#13;
Investment Disputes (ICSID), unless the matter falls outside the&#13;
jurisdiction of ICSID in which case it shall be finally settled under the&#13;
Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce at Paris.&#13;
i)    The JOS Unit will pay Minimum TELKOM Revenues to TELKOM on a&#13;
monthly basis. These payments will be made in addition to and before the&#13;
calculation of the Distributable JOS Revenues. The Minimum TELKOM&#13;
Revenues will be paid to TELKOM to compensate it for the financial benefits&#13;
that TELKOM would have received from its Existing Installation in a Territory&#13;
if a JOS had not been entered into. Bidders are requested to propose the amount&#13;
of Minimum TELKOM Revenues they would pay to meet this objective. The&#13;
JOS Agreement will determine the amount of Minimum TELKOM Revenues to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66                                ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
be paid and will require the Investor to guarantee payment by the JOS Unit of&#13;
that amount.&#13;
j)     To recover its investment in the construction of the New Installation and the&#13;
upgrading of the Existing Installation (including its return on that investment),&#13;
the Investor will share with TELKOM the Distributable JOS Revenues generated&#13;
by services offered on both the New and Existing Installations.&#13;
k)    Upon entering into the JOS Agreement, an Investor will be required to pay&#13;
TELKOM an Initial Investor Payment.&#13;
1)    In evaluating the Proposals for each Territory, the Evaluation Team will first&#13;
review each Proposal to ensure compliance with the technical and other&#13;
conditions specified in this RFP. Provided it complies with the requirements of&#13;
the RFP, the Evaluation Team will recommend that, for each JOS, the&#13;
Government should select the Bidder whose proposal offers the highest&#13;
aggregate financial benefits to TELKOM based on the following three factors:&#13;
i)    the highest amount of Minimum TELKOM Revenues;&#13;
ii)   the highest percentage share of Distributable JOS Revenues for&#13;
TELKOM, and&#13;
iii)   highest Initial Investor Payment.&#13;
Subject to Government approval, the Evaluation Team intends to commence&#13;
negotiations with the highest Bidder for each JOS Territory (in terms of these&#13;
three variables) to establish definitive JOS Agreements.&#13;
m)    There will be a Preparation Period between the signing of the JOS Agreements&#13;
and the commencement of the JOS Period, which is scheduled for January 1,&#13;
1996. During the Preparation Period the Investor will mobilize its resources,&#13;
commence construction and otherwise prepare for the implementation of the&#13;
JOS. TELKOM will continue to operate the Existing Installation during the&#13;
Preparation Period. Revenue sharing and the transfer of management&#13;
responsibilities to the Investor will commence at the beginning of the JOS&#13;
Period.&#13;
n)    During the JOS Period, the Investor will remain owner of the portions of the&#13;
New Installation that it has constructed. At the end of the JOS Period, the&#13;
ownership of the New Installation will be transferred to TELKOM. Unless&#13;
otherwise agreed in writing, TELKOM will take over all aspects of the&#13;
operations of the JOS System at that time.&#13;
o)    At the time of transfer, the Investor will not receive compensation for that part&#13;
of the New Installation which was constructed within the Construction Period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
67                                ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
p)    Either TELKOM or the Investor may propose additional New Installation&#13;
construction projects during or after the Construction Period. The Investor will&#13;
have a first right of negotiation to implement such additional projects. If such&#13;
additional projects are implemented, the Investor will receive compensation for&#13;
the value of such additional New Installation at the end of the JOS Period. The&#13;
amount of compensation will be based on the Net Present Value of the Investor's&#13;
projected revenue share attributable to such New Installation during the&#13;
remainder of the Payback Period approved by the Minister at the time additional&#13;
New Installation construction projects were approved. This compensation is&#13;
intended to provide an incentive for the Investor to continue to expand the JOS&#13;
System to meet demand throughout the JOS Period. A similar compensation&#13;
arrangement will apply if TELKOM exercises its early buy-out option during the&#13;
last one-third of the JOS Period.&#13;
2.     Legal Framework of the Joint Operation Schemes&#13;
The JOSs will be established in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Indonesia,&#13;
and particularly, Telecommunications Law Number 3 of 1989, which governs the provision of&#13;
telecommunications services in the Republic of Indonesia; the 1993 Government Regulation on&#13;
the Operation of Telecommunications (No. PP 8/93); and the 1993 Ministerial Decree&#13;
(No. KM.39/KS.002/MPPT93) on Corporation in the Implementation of Basic&#13;
Telecommunications Services.&#13;
The Indonesian legal framework authorizes TELKOM, in its capacity as the national&#13;
telecommunications operator, to implement cooperative operation agreements with the private&#13;
sector in relation to the provision of telecommunications services. The JOSs to be established&#13;
pursuant to this RFP are the Government's selected mode of cooperative operation.&#13;
Accordingly, in each of the five JOS Territories, the Minister intends to grant a license to an&#13;
Investor pursuant to Article 5 of PP 8/93 and Article 28 of KM 39/93 to enter into a JOS with&#13;
TELKOM.&#13;
3.    Investor Status Requirements&#13;
The Investor shall be an Indonesian national Joint Venture Company ("JVC")&#13;
established under the laws of the Republic of Indonesia. At least one member of the JVC shall&#13;
be a highly experienced public telecommunications operator (PTO). At least one PTO must hold&#13;
a significant equity interest in the Investor and take the leading role in providing the&#13;
management and operational expertise for the JOS Project.&#13;
During the JOS Period the composition of the participants in the Investor shall not be&#13;
changed, nor shall their percentage levels of equity participation in the Investor be changed,&#13;
except with the prior written approval of the Minister. In order to provide continuity and&#13;
accountability for the achievement of the Repelita VI JOS objectives, approval will not be&#13;
granted for a significant reduction in the participation of the PTO(s) in the Investor, save in&#13;
exceptional circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
68                                ANNEX 6-&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
During the JOS Period the Investor shall maintain a debt to equity ratio such that the&#13;
equity portion of its total financing is at no times less than 40%. Investors must comply with the&#13;
requirements of KEPPRES 39/1991 relating to the approval of offshore loans.&#13;
4.     Guarantees&#13;
Neither the Government nor TELKOM will provide any financial guarantees to the&#13;
Investor, its lenders or other financial backers in relation to the JOS or the Investor's investment&#13;
under the JOS Agreement. The public telecommunications operators participating in the&#13;
Investor will be required to guarantee the performance of the Investor under the JOS Agreement.&#13;
5.     Scope of the Joint Operation Schemes&#13;
The purpose of the JOS in each Territory will be to perform all activities required to&#13;
expand, upgrade and operate the JOS System in the Territory in a manner comparable to world&#13;
class telecommunications systems. Responsibility for the planning, design and construction of&#13;
the New Installation and the upgrading of the Existing Installation will rest with the Investor.&#13;
The JOS System in each Territory is to be operated on behalf of and in the name of&#13;
TELKOM. TELKOM shall be responsible for monitoring and supervision of the JOS Unit to&#13;
ensure that the objectives of the JOS are achieved. TELKOM will delegate to the Investor&#13;
responsibility for the management of the JOS Unit, which shall be responsible for the operation&#13;
of the integrated JOS System. JOS Units are to make the maximum use of available domestic&#13;
resources, human and material resources in accordance with Government policy. Over time, the&#13;
JOS Unit shall replace expatriate employees and consultants with qualified Indonesian nationals.&#13;
6.    Interconnection&#13;
The JOS System shall interconnect with the facilities of TELKOM long distance&#13;
network at the secondary centre (S.C.) exchanges, which shall continue to be operated by&#13;
TELKOM. Traffic shall be exchanged between the JOS System, TELKOM's System and other&#13;
JOS Systems on a Sender Keep All (SKA) basis. Under the SKA arrangements, the JOS Unit&#13;
shall keep all revenues for traffic that originates in the JOS, except for the amount due to the&#13;
international service providers, Indosat and Satelindo based on prevailing interconnection tariffs.&#13;
In return the JOS Unit will receive settlement payments from the international service providers&#13;
in accordance with prevailing tariffs for international calls terminating in the JOS Territory. The&#13;
JOS Unit will terminate all traffic received from TELKOM or other JOS Units without&#13;
compensation.&#13;
7.    Integration of Existing and New Installations&#13;
The Investor will be required to construct the New Installation and to exercise its&#13;
responsibilities in the operation of the JOS System so that the New Installation will operate in an&#13;
integrated manner. Wherever it is practical and cost-effective, the Investor should use and&#13;
upgrade existing facilities, rather than construct new facilities. However, this obligation shall&#13;
not relieve the Investor of its obligations to construct the specified minimum number of new&#13;
Access Line Units. The performance of the JOS System will be measured in accordance with&#13;
specified performance indicators, this RFP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
69                                ANNEX-4&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
Proposals from Investors should take into account the need to upgrade, and if necessary&#13;
replace, financial, operational and management information systems in order to improve the&#13;
efficiency of the JOS System. The Investor shall coordinate with TELKOM to ensure that&#13;
upgraded and new systems are compatible with TELKOM's requirements. All systems that are&#13;
upgraded or replaced must utilize fully tested and stable technology. The Investor shall ensure&#13;
that full documentation is provided to the JOS Unit for each system including, wherever&#13;
possible, source code listings for computer software.&#13;
The Investor shall ensure that, wherever possible, payments related to licenses for&#13;
computer software or other technology employed in the JOS do not extend beyond the JOS&#13;
Period. Any license that will impose financial obligations on TELKOM or another person&#13;
following the JOS Period must be submitted to TELKOM for review and approval prior to the&#13;
Investor entering into it. Licenses that are to be entered into in the name of TELKOM must in&#13;
all cases be furnished to TELKOM in advance for TELKOM's review and approval. Licenses&#13;
entered into in the name of the Investor must be fuliv assignable to TELKOM without charge at&#13;
or before the end of the JOS Period. Promptly after a license is entered into the Investor shall&#13;
supply a copy of the license to TELKOM.&#13;

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Assumptions Used for Financial Projections&#13;
Price Levels and Tariffs&#13;
1.        Prices:  The foreign and domestic inflation rates of 2.2%  and 5.0%  p.a.,&#13;
respectively, are assumed for the projection period. The exchange rate of Rp. 2,193 to the US&#13;
dollar is used.&#13;
2.        Tariffs:   Tariffs schedules as shown in Annex 4 are used through 1996. From&#13;
1997 onward call and installation charges are assumed to decline annually by 5% and 25%,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
3.        Future Facilities. The number of connection for telephone, staffing, quality of&#13;
service and other productivity improvements for the projection period are shown in Annex 7&#13;
(Agreed Performance Indicators).&#13;
Income Statements&#13;
4.        Operating Revenues. The operating revenue is generated from network managed&#13;
by TELKOM and the network that is expected to be managed by the Joint Operations Scheme&#13;
(JOS) Division in the five areas starting in 1996. The contribution of revenue from the JOS&#13;
Divisions to TELKOM consists of (i) initial investor payment, (ii) minimum revenue&#13;
contribution by the JOS to TELKOM to manage TELKOM's existing network; and (iii) revenue&#13;
sharing arrangement of the distributable revenue (which is the gross revenue minus cash&#13;
operating cost of the total network and minimum guaranteed revenue to TELKOM for managing&#13;
its existing network). Initial investor payment and minimum TELKOM revenue are based on&#13;
the results of the bidding held on March 21, 1995. As for revenue share, it is assumed that&#13;
TELKOM will receive an average 20% of the distributable revenue. The operating revenue for&#13;
each of the services are calculated as follows:&#13;
(i)    Telephone and Telex - Traffic revenues are calculated by multiplying the&#13;
total traffic (pulses or minutes) by the price per pulse or minute for local,&#13;
long distance and international calls. Traffic of domestic automatic per line&#13;
is assumed to decline at an annual rate of 5%. For international revenue&#13;
projection, the revenue sharing with INDOSAT is assumed at 25%, starting&#13;
January 1995 (to TELKOM) throughout the projection period. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 3&#13;
rental revenue is calculated on the basis of existing lines and additional lines&#13;
installed during each year. The installation revenue charge for each year is&#13;
calculated on new lines installed during the year with 50% shown as revenue&#13;
for the year and the remainder as revenue for the following year.&#13;
(ii)   Existing Revenue Sharing Arrangement (RSA): The share of TELKOM's&#13;
revenue from RSA is assumed at 30% of the pulse revenue.&#13;
5.    Operating Expenses. The operating expenses are assumed as follows:&#13;
(I)    Personnel cost is calculated as the average number of employees times&#13;
average salary, including benefits, per employee. The total number of&#13;
employees is expected to increase, but the staffing ratio is expected to&#13;
decrease as measures are taken to improve operational efficiency. Annual&#13;
salaries are projected to increased by 10% p.a. in real terms due to the&#13;
effects of salary increases as well as the change in staff profile with a&#13;
higher percentage of more qualified staff.&#13;
(ii)   General and administrative cost per staff is assumed to grow by 10%&#13;
annually.&#13;
(iii)   Repair and maintenance cost is calculated as the average number of main&#13;
lines times repair and maintenance (R&amp;M) per average main line. R&amp;M&#13;
per main line and is assumed to increase by 5% per annum in real terms.&#13;
(iv)   Provision for doubtful debt is a percentage of billed revenues and is&#13;
projected at 5% of outstanding accounts receivable.&#13;
(v)   Other expenses are estimated at 2.5% of revenue.&#13;
(vi)   Depreciation is on a double declining method. It is assumed depreciation&#13;
rate will decline gradually to 22% during the projection period.&#13;
Balance Sheet Items&#13;
6.    Gross Fixed Assets reflect the investment program in Annex 14 and transfers from&#13;
work-in-progress.&#13;
7.    Accounts Receivable is measured as the number days of total operating revenue.&#13;
It is assumed to remain at 20 days of TELKOM's billing during the projection period.&#13;
8.    Inventories are estimated as a percentage on gross fixed assets in service and are&#13;
projected to reduce to 5.0% of gross assets by 1996. Provision for inventory is assumed&#13;
at 3.0% of inventory.&#13;

Return on Investments&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
The assumptions made in deriving the benefit and costs streams used to calculate the financial&#13;
and economic rates of return on investments are outlined below.&#13;
Capital Cost&#13;
TELKOM's investment program  over the period 1994-1998 has been categorized as&#13;
investments under (i) ongoing works, (ii) investments included in the Telecommunications Sector&#13;
Modernization Project and (iii) future works. Investments under the TSM Project would also benefit the&#13;
existing as well as new network to be installed under the on-going program. However, in calculating the&#13;
return on investments for the proposed project, the cost and benefits directly associated with the proposed&#13;
project, that is the connected new subscribers related to the one million lines of capacity to be added under&#13;
the proposed project during the 1995-97 period, have been included. The capital cost of the project is&#13;
adjusted by excluding the value added tax of 10% levied to net out transfer payments.&#13;
Other Costs and Benefit Streams&#13;
Incremental operating costs stream are specified as the expected operating costs for the new&#13;
lines to be connected under the proposed project. Thus the operating cost is estimated on the average&#13;
operating cost per line (excluding depreciation, amortization and corporate taxes) based on the financial&#13;
projections (Annex 21).&#13;
Similarly, the incremental revenues are specified as expected revenue from the new lines to be&#13;
connected under the proposed project. The revenue in each year is estimated based on the average revenue&#13;
per line based on the financial projections (Annex 21). The revenue is adjusted by including the value&#13;
added tax of 10%.&#13;
Time Horizon&#13;
The time horizon for the project cost and benefit streams extends from 1995 to 2010. At the&#13;
end of this period it is estimated that on average all equipment provided under the project would have&#13;
completed its useful life. From 1999 onward all costs and benefits related to the proposed project are&#13;
expected to remain constant in nominal terms.&#13;
Rate of Return&#13;
The cost and benefit streams for estimating the economic rate of return (ERR) are shown in&#13;
Table 21. 1. The cost and benefit streams have not been shadow priced since the procurement of most items&#13;
are on competitive basis, skilled labor is mainly used and Indonesia has an open foreign exchange market.&#13;
The net benefit stream was deflated to reflect constant 1994 prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 22&#13;

Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of return is estimated at 33%. Although the&#13;
implementation of the physical component does not present any significant risks, the sensitivity of ERR&#13;
estimate with respect to the effects of the following scenarios were considered:&#13;
ERR&#13;
(a) a delay of 12 months in connection of new subscribers                                    20&#13;
resulting in a delay in revenue of 12 months;&#13;
(b) 10%  increase in capital cost;                                                           28&#13;
(c) combining (a) and (b)                                                                    18&#13;
Even under the most improbable scenario, (c), the project would be acceptable. Furthermore, each of these&#13;
estimates underestimates the true ERR because they do not include: (a) any improvements in the existing&#13;
network performance due to the project; (b) estimates of consumer surplus; and (c) the major productivity&#13;
and quality improvements expected to follow from the JOS initiative. In addition to quantitative factors, the&#13;
project contributes indirectly to poverty alleviation through general economic and social development&#13;
linked to both the important productivity improvements and access to markets and market information&#13;
that arise from access to telecommunications. The project also contains important measures to improve&#13;
access to the public telephone system by the less well off. In particular, the project accelerates the&#13;
expansion in the number of public pay-phones towards a target of 3 % of total lines; supports the JOS&#13;
initiative which requires investors to allocate a significant part of total investments in less economically&#13;
attractive areas; and includes two rural pilot projects to develop and test approaches to dramatically&#13;
improve the affordability and viability of telephone service in rural areas.&#13;

            Indonesia - Telecommunications Sector
            Modernization Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Telecommunications Sector
            Modernization Project supports, and is predicated on a
            comprehensive reform program for the telecommunications
            sector. The reform is based on three key elements: entry of
            world class operators, competition in all segments of the
            sector, and reorganization of the established public
            telecommunications service provider. The project has three
            components. The policy component entails: 1) reviewing and
            developing as appropriate the telecommunications legal and
            regulatory environment to ensure effective entry of private
            investors and operators in the telecommunications sector; 2)
            strengthening the capability of the Ministry of Tourism,
            Post and Telecommunications to manage regulatory issues
            including monitoring and evaluating operators'
            performance in the emerging multi-operator environment; 3)
            reviewing the management and allocation of radio frequency
            spectrum and 4) developing a plan for the provision of rural
            telephone services on a commercial basis. The investment
            component includes: 1) installation of local and
            inter-exchange networks to add one million telephone lines;
            2) installation of a second fiber optic back-bone system; 3)
            installation of submarine optical fiber cable transmission
            systems; and 4) enhancement of information systems. The
            technical component will support: 1) strengthening the
            project implementation, marketing, customer services
            capacities; and 2) improving TELKOM's managerial capabilities.
