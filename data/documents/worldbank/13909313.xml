            The political economy of sanitation : how
            can we increase investment and improve service for the poor?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study follows current approaches to
            political economy-interdisciplinary inquiry drawing upon
            social and political theory and economic principles-to
            understand how political actors, institutions, and economic
            processes influence each other. The 'political economy
            of sanitation,' therefore, refers to the social,
            political, and economic processes and factors that determine
            the extent and nature of sanitation investment and service
            provision. This study's conceptual framework combines a
            diagnostic component with a typology of actions to help
            translate analytical findings into more effective support to
            operations and investments. The diagnostic framework aims to
            identify political economy constraints as well as
            opportunities that are entry points for subsequent
            operational actions. The study was conducted through a
            qualitative analysis of stakeholders, institutions, impacts,
            risks, and opportunities that was linked to processes and
            policy debate. This synthesis report is based on the
            findings from the secondary literature review and the
            results of primary research in the four case study
            countries, which examined how each had identified and
            managed political economy risks and opportunities in its
            sanitation interventions. Overall, the study confirms the
            importance of assessing stakeholder interests, identifying
            potential winners and losers, identifying incentives, and
            examining formal and informal institutions.
