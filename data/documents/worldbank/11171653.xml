&amp;#12;MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION &amp; ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL&#13;
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#13;
&#13;
I. OVERVIEW&#13;
International Finance Corporation (IFC or the Corporation) is an international organization, established in 1956, to further economic growth in its developing&#13;
member countries by promoting private sector development. IFC is a member of the World Bank Group, which also includes the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD or the World Bank), the International Development Association (IDA), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee&#13;
Agency (MIGA). It is a legal entity separate and distinct from the World Bank, IDA, and MIGA, with its own Articles of Agreement, share capital, financial struc-&#13;
ture, management, and staff. Membership in IFC is open only to member countries of the World Bank. As of June 30, 2002, IFC's entire share capital was held&#13;
by 175 member countries.&#13;
    IFC's principal products are loans and equity investments, with a small but growing guarantee portfolio. Unlike most multilateral development institutions,&#13;
IFC does not accept host government guarantees. IFC raises virtually all of the funds for its lending activities through the issuance of debt obligations in the&#13;
international capital markets, while maintaining a small borrowing window with the World Bank. Equity investments are funded from net worth. During the year&#13;
ended June 30, 2002 (FY02), IFC had an authorized borrowing ceiling of $4.5 billion (including $1.0 billion to allow for possible prefunding of the funding pro-&#13;
gram for the year ending June 30, 2003 (FY03) during FY02).&#13;
    IFC's capital base and its assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in US dollars. The Corporation seeks to minimize market risk (foreign exchange&#13;
and interest rate risks) by closely matching the currency, rate bases, and maturity of its liabilities in various currencies with assets with the same characteristics.&#13;
The Corporation controls residual market risk by utilizing currency and interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II. FINANCIAL SUMMARY&#13;
BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (US GAAP).&#13;
    The Corporation has traditionally prepared one set of financial statements and footnotes, complying with both US GAAP and International Accounting&#13;
Standards (IAS). However, due to material differences between US Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative&#13;
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivatives and Certain Hedging Relationships (collectively SFAS&#13;
No. 133), which became effective for the Corporation on July 1, 2000, and its counterpart in IAS, IAS No. 39, Financial Instruments Recognition and&#13;
Measurement, which became effective for the Corporation on July 1, 2001, it is no longer possible for the Corporation to satisfy the requirements of both US&#13;
GAAP and IAS via one set of financial statements.&#13;
    IFC is actively monitoring developments related to accounting standards and the primary basis for preparation of its financial statements, all with a view to&#13;
the necessary systems and controls to manage its various lines of business. IFC plans to resume presentation of its financial statements using IAS by the year&#13;
ending June 30, 2007.&#13;
    Unless stated otherwise, discussions of financial performance herein refer to operating income, which excludes the effects of adopting SFAS No. 133. The&#13;
effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income are discussed in Section VI.&#13;
&#13;
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY&#13;
From year to year, IFC's operating income is affected by a number of factors, principally the magnitude of provisions for losses against its loans, equity invest-&#13;
ments, and guarantees; loans in nonaccrual status and recoveries of interest on loans formerly in nonaccrual status; and income (dividends and capital gains)&#13;
generated from its equity portfolio. A significant part of IFC's liquid assets portfolio is invested in fixed income securities, which are also subject to external&#13;
market factors that affect the value of such securities, adding variability to operating income. Beginning in FY01, net income also includes unrealized gains and&#13;
losses on financial instruments other than from trading activities, pursuant to the implementation of SFAS No. 133.&#13;
     IFC has been consistently profitable since its inception in 1956, and recorded operating income for FY02 of $161 million, as compared with $241 million&#13;
for the year ended June 30, 2001 (FY01), and $380 million for the year ended June 30, 2000 (FY00). Despite the tough economic environment in emerging&#13;
markets, particularly in Argentina, one of IFC's largest exposures, the Corporation was able to record net income, including the effects of SFAS No. 133, of&#13;
$215 million for FY02, as compared with $345 million for FY01 and $380 million for FY00.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;III. CLIENT SERVICES&#13;
BUSINESS OVERVIEW&#13;
In partnership with private investors, IFC assists in financing the establishment, improvement, and expansion of private sector enterprises by making investments&#13;
where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. IFC seeks to bring together domestic and foreign private capital and experienced&#13;
management and thereby create conditions conducive to the flow of private capital, domestic and foreign, into productive investments in its developing member&#13;
countries. In this way, IFC plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional project funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through&#13;
loan syndications, underwritings, and guarantees. In addition to project finance (described below) and resource mobilization, IFC offers financial and technical&#13;
advisory services to private businesses in developing member countries. It also advises member governments on private sector development matters.&#13;
    IFC's investments are normally made in its developing member countries. The Articles of Agreement mandate that IFC shall invest in productive private&#13;
enterprise. The requirement for private ownership does not disqualify enterprises that are partly owned by the public sector if such enterprises are organized&#13;
under local commercial and corporate law, operate free of host government control in a market context and according to profitability criteria, and/or are in the&#13;
process of being totally or partially privatized.&#13;
    The Corporation's main investment activity is project financing. This encompasses "greenfield" projects, expansions, and modernizations. IFC also provides&#13;
corporate credits to selected companies to finance ongoing programs of investment projects. In addition, the Corporation facilitates financing through financial&#13;
intermediaries, covering project and general purpose lending and specialized lending products such as leasing, trade, and mortgage finance. These financial&#13;
intermediaries function either as IFC's borrower, on-lending to private sector companies at their own risk, or as IFC's agent, identifying companies for direct&#13;
loans from IFC.&#13;
    The Corporation applies stringent tests of enterprise soundness, project viability, and developmental impact in determining the eligibility of projects for its&#13;
investments.&#13;
&#13;
INVESTMENT PROCESS AND PORTFOLIO SUPERVISION&#13;
IFC's investment process can be divided into six main stages:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Identification &amp; appraisal        Board approval           Document negotiation                                Commitment             Disbursement         Supervision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The initial four stages are carried out under the responsibility of the Vice President, Investment Operations, while the fifth and sixth stages are overseen by&#13;
the Vice President, Portfolio and Risk Management.&#13;
    The Corporation carefully supervises its projects to monitor project performance and compliance with contractual obligations and with IFC's internal poli-&#13;
cies and procedures. IFC's Board of Directors is informed of such matters and of recommended courses of action at regular intervals.&#13;
&#13;
REORGANIZATION OF THE CORPORATION'S INVESTMENT DEPARTMENTS&#13;
The Corporation undertook a reorganization of its investment departments in the last quarter of FY02. The reorganization was undertaken with the goal of&#13;
increasing the volume of high-quality assets and sharpening the focus on the needs of IFC's clients and strengthening development impact. Regional depart-&#13;
ments are being transformed into business development centers based in the field, and senior staff are being assigned to regional hubs specifically for business&#13;
development. Having such people in the field will not only strengthen IFC's country knowledge but will also help increase IFC's engagement with the domestic&#13;
private sector. The reorganization is also intended to concentrate IFC's worldwide experience in financial markets and general manufacturing in two specialist&#13;
departments, responsible for all investment processing and portfolio supervision. The financial effects of the reorganization on the Corporation's operating&#13;
income for FY02 are detailed in Section VII.&#13;

&amp;#12;Disbursements&#13;
IFC disbursed $1.5 billion for its own account in FY02 ($1.5 billion in FY01). The lower level of disbursements in FY01 and FY02, as compared to FY00 ($2.2&#13;
billion), is mainly attributable to the difficult investment climate in the emerging markets in which IFC operates, together with the changing product mix in the past&#13;
two years from direct investment products such as loans and equity investments to off-balance-sheet products such as guarantees. At June 30, 2002, IFC's&#13;
disbursed and outstanding loans and equity investments for its own account (disbursed investment portfolio) were $10.7 billion ($10.9 billion at June 30, 2001).&#13;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          5&#13;
&amp;#12;INVESTMENT PRODUCTS&#13;
Loans&#13;
Loans account for the major part of the financing provided by IFC, representing 75% of the Corporation's disbursed investment portfolio as of June 30, 2002,&#13;
unchanged from June 30, 2001.&#13;
&#13;
Loans will generally have the following characteristics:&#13;
· Term: typically amortizing with final maturities of up to 12 years&#13;
· Currency: primarily in major convertible currencies, principally US dollar, and to a lesser extent, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen&#13;
· Interest rate: fixed or variable&#13;
· Pricing: reflects such factors as market conditions and country and project risks; variable rate loans are generally tied to the 6-month LIBOR index in the&#13;
  relevant currency.&#13;
                                                                                         CURRENCY COMPOSITION OF LOAN PORTFOLIO&#13;
     Since FY99, IFC has offered local currency loan products to certain clients,&#13;
provided the Corporation is able to hedge its local currency exposure through                                  10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    Billions of U.S. Dollars&#13;
mechanisms such as cross-currency swaps or forward contracts. Fixed-rate&#13;
                                                                                                                8&#13;
loans and loans in currencies other than US dollars are normally transformed,&#13;
using currency and/or interest rate swaps, into US dollar variable rate loans.                                  6&#13;
&#13;
     On June 30, 2002, total loans disbursed and outstanding were $8.0 billion                                  4&#13;
($8.2 billion at June 30, 2001). At June 30, 2002, 89% (91% at June 30, 2001)&#13;
                                                                                                                2&#13;
of the Corporation's loans were US dollar-denominated. The currency compo-&#13;
sition of the loan portfolio is shown on the accompanying diagram (right).                                      0&#13;

Equity&#13;
Equity investments accounted for 25% of the Corporation's disbursed investment portfolio at June 30, 2002, unchanged from June 30, 2001. IFC's equity&#13;
investments are typically in the form of common or preferred stock and are usually denominated in the currency of the country in which the investment is made.&#13;
&#13;
Quasi-equity&#13;
In addition to traditional equity investments, the Corporation provides financing through a variety of quasi-equity instruments, which constitute a growing portion&#13;
of its investment portfolio. Quasi-equities include subordinated or convertible loans, asset-backed securities, and certain common or preferred shares with put&#13;
and/or call features. Depending upon their characteristics, quasi-equities may be classified as either loans or equity investments in the Corporation's balance&#13;
sheet. At June 30, 2002, the Corporation's disbursed and outstanding quasi-equity portfolio totaled $1,342 million ($1,326 million at June 30, 2001), of which&#13;
$1,157 million was classified as loans ($1,160 million at June 30, 2001) and $185 million ($166 million at June 30, 2001) was classified as equity investments&#13;
in the Corporation's balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Loan participations (B-loans)&#13;
IFC finances only a portion, usually not more than 25%, of the cost of any project. All IFC-financed projects, therefore, require other financial partners. The prin-&#13;
cipal direct means by which the Corporation mobilizes such private sector finance is through the sale of participations in its loans, known as the B-loan program.&#13;
Through the B-loan program, IFC has cooperated primarily with commercial banks but also with non-bank financial institutions in financing projects since the&#13;
early 1960s. More than 190 commercial banks and institutional investors currently participate in IFC's B-loan program.&#13;
    Whenever it syndicates a loan, IFC will always make a loan for its own account (an A-loan), thereby sharing the risk alongside its loan participants. IFC acts&#13;
as the lender of record and is responsible for the administration of the entire loan, including the B-loan. IFC charges fees to the borrower at prevailing market&#13;
rates to cover the cost of the syndication of the B-loan. Since it began its loan syndication program, IFC has placed participations totaling $20.9 billion.&#13;
&#13;
Client risk management services&#13;
IFC provides clients access to asset and liability management tools such as currency swaps and interest rate swaps, caps, and floors by acting as an interme-&#13;
diary between clients and market counterparties. IFC also provides risk-sharing structures and guarantees that allow its clients to transact directly with market&#13;
counterparties.&#13;
&#13;
Guarantees and partial credit guarantees&#13;
Guarantees represent a growing product line for the Corporation. Beginning in FY01, the Corporation began offering partial credit guarantees to clients cov-&#13;
ering, on a risk-sharing basis, client obligations on bonds and/or loans. The Corporation's guarantee is available for debt instruments and trade obligations of&#13;
clients and covers commercial as well as noncommercial risks. IFC will provide local currency guarantees but generally only if the Corporation is able to fund&#13;
its commitment in local currency terms, for example, by hedging its exposure in the swap market. Guarantee fees are charged consistent with IFC's loan pricing&#13;
policies. During FY02, the Corporation signed $0.3 billion of guarantees, as compared with $0.5 billion in FY01.&#13;
&#13;
Underwritings and investment banking services&#13;
IFC provides underwriting and placement services for equity, quasi-equity, and/or debt securities issues of private sector companies in IFC's developing&#13;
member countries. It also structures and underwrites funds and pooled investment vehicles such as private equity investment funds. IFC is often a core investor&#13;
in the enterprises it underwrites. Services are priced in conformity with market standards and practices, in consultation with international securities firms and&#13;
financial intermediaries. Underwriting and other capital markets services requiring a financial commitment from IFC are subject to the same investment criteria&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  6&#13;
&amp;#12;and limits applicable to its loan and equity investments.&#13;
    The Corporation does not conduct any placement activities within the United States or directed at US investors in connection with securities offerings of pri-&#13;
vate sector companies or pooled investment vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
Advisory activities&#13;
The Corporation, on its own or through a department jointly managed with the World Bank, provides three general types of advisory services to member coun-&#13;
tries as well as to individual enterprises:&#13;
· Special advisory services on project structuring and financial packaging&#13;
· Financial advisory services provided to member governments or to private sector clients&#13;
· Policy advice to governments on capital markets development and private sector development, including privatization and foreign investment.&#13;
&#13;
    The Corporation also assists governments with developing the legal frameworks for privatizing their state-owned sectors, as well as with the sale of indi-&#13;
vidual enterprises. Fees are charged for advisory services consistent with market rates charged for comparable services. IFC recorded such fees amounting to&#13;
$40 million for FY02 ($41 million for FY01 and $49 million for FY00).&#13;
&#13;
Specially targeted assistance&#13;
IFC has established a number of vehicles through which it provides specially targeted assistance to areas highly in need of development. In FY02, the&#13;
Corporation contributed $22 million to such vehicles, compared with $16 million in FY01 and $7 million in FY00. In FY02, such vehicles included:&#13;
&#13;
· The World Bank Group's Global SME Capacity Building Facility, which funds partnerships and programs that support the core pillars of the World Bank&#13;
  Group's Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) strategy.&#13;
· The Private Enterprise Partnership, which provides focused technical assistance, with the goal of helping build successful private businesses in the former&#13;
  Soviet Union region.&#13;
· The Corporation's own Technical Assistance Trust Funds, which provide resources through which IFC can cofinance technical assistance being supported&#13;
  by donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IV. TREASURY SERVICES&#13;
Liquid assets&#13;
IFC invests its surplus liquidity in highly rated fixed and floating rate instruments issued by, or unconditionally guaranteed by, governments, government agen-&#13;
cies and instrumentalities, multilateral organizations, and AAA-rated corporate issuers, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities, and in time deposits&#13;
and other unconditional obligations of banks and financial institutions.&#13;
    The Corporation manages the market risk associated with these investments through a variety of hedging techniques including derivatives, principally cur-&#13;
rency and interest rate swaps and financial futures.&#13;
    IFC's liquid assets are invested in four separate portfolios.&#13;

&amp;#12;    The P3 portfolio is not permitted to exceed 12% of the total value of liquid assets at any time.&#13;
    The P1 and P2 portfolios were accounted for as available-for-sale portfolios through June 30, 2000. Effective July 1, 2000, these portfolios were redesig-&#13;
nated as trading portfolios to more closely reflect the management style of the portfolios as discussed in Note A to the Corporation's financial statements for the&#13;
year ended June 30, 2002. The P0 and P3 portfolios are also accounted for as trading portfolios.&#13;
    Beginning in FY01, the Corporation adopted a more flexible approach to managing the P1 portfolio by making investments on an aggregate portfolio basis&#13;
against its benchmark within specified risk parameters. The P2 portfolio is also actively managed on an aggregate basis to its benchmark. In implementing these&#13;
portfolio management strategies, the Corporation utilizes derivative instruments, futures, and options, and takes long or short positions in securities.&#13;
    All liquid assets are managed according to an investment authority approved by IFC's Board of Directors and investment guidelines approved by IFC's&#13;
Finance and Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the Management Group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CAPITALIZATION&#13;
The Corporation's capitalization as of June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2001 is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      FY02                       FY01&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           Borrowings from market sources&#13;
                                                                           Borrowings from the World Bank&#13;
                                                                           Paid-in capital&#13;
                                                                           Retained earnings &amp; other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings&#13;
The major source of IFC's borrowings is the international capital markets. Under the Articles of Agreement, the Corporation may borrow in the public markets&#13;
of a member country only with approvals from that member and also the member in whose currency the borrowing is denominated. The Corporation borrowed&#13;
$4.0 billion during FY02 ($3.6 billion in FY01 and $4.4 billion in FY00). In addition, IFC's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase and redemption of&#13;
and tender for debt obligations issued by the Corporation. During FY02, the Corporation repurchased and retired $186 million of outstanding debt ($134 mil-&#13;
lion in FY01).&#13;
     IFC diversifies its borrowings by currency, country, source, and maturity to provide flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Outstanding market borrowings have&#13;
remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to almost 30 years, with a weighted average remaining maturity of 8.8 years at June 30, 2002 (7.2 years&#13;
at June 30, 2001).&#13;
     Market borrowings are generally swapped into floating-rate obligations denominated in US dollars. As of June 30, 2002, the Corporation had gross payables&#13;
from borrowing-related currency swaps of $10.2 billion ($10.6 billion at June 30, 2001) and from borrowing-related interest rate swaps in the notional principal&#13;
amount of $7.1 billion ($6.3 billion at June 30, 2001). After the effect of these derivative instruments is taken into consideration, all of the Corporation's market&#13;
borrowings at June 30, 2002, and June 30, 2001, were US dollar-denominated.&#13;
     The weighted average cost of market borrowings after currency and interest rate swap transactions was 1.8% at June 30, 2002 (4.3% at June 30, 2001).&#13;
&#13;
Capital and retained earnings&#13;
As of June 30, 2002, IFC's net worth (presented as Total Capital in the Corporation's balance sheet) amounted to $6.3 billion, up from the June 30, 2001, level&#13;
of $6.1 billion.&#13;
    As of June 30, 2002, and 2001, IFC's authorized capital was $2.45 billion, of which $2.37 billion was subscribed at June 30, 2002, unchanged from June&#13;
30, 2001. Over 99% of this was paid in ($2.36 billion at June 30, 2002, and June 30, 2001). The Corporation has agreed to defer the payment dates for&#13;
certain member countries. Pursuant to these arrangements, $2 million of subscribed shares remained unpaid at June 30, 2002 ($14 million - June 30, 2001).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
V. RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL POLICIES&#13;
RISKS IN IFC'S BUSINESS&#13;
IFC assumes various kinds of risks in its private sector development business. The Corporation's operations and activities are principally subject to commercial&#13;
or project risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk. Active management of these risks is an essential part of the Corporation's operations&#13;
and a key determinant of its ability to maintain a stable capital and earnings base. To this end, it has adopted several key financial policies and a number of pru-&#13;
dential policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  8&#13;
&amp;#12;KEY FINANCIAL POLICIES&#13;
IFC currently operates under the following key financial policies which have been approved by its Board of Directors:&#13;
1. Disbursed equity plus quasi-equity investments (net of loss reserves) may not exceed 100% of net worth.&#13;
2. Minimum liquidity (including liquid assets and undrawn borrowing commitments from the World Bank) must be sufficient at all times to cover at least 65% of&#13;
   IFC's estimated net cash requirements for the next three years.&#13;
3. The currency, rate basis, and maturity of loan assets must be closely matched to borrowings.&#13;
4. Capital (including paid-in capital, retained earnings, and general loss reserve) must equal at least 30% of risk-weighted assets.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, under IFC's Articles of Agreement, as long as IFC has outstanding borrowings from the World Bank, IFC's leverage, as measured by the ratio of&#13;
IFC's debt (borrowings plus outstanding guarantees) to IFC's equity (subscribed capital plus retained earnings), may not exceed 4.0 to 1.&#13;
&#13;
MANAGING COMMERCIAL (PROJECT) RISK&#13;
IFC is prohibited from accepting host government guarantees of repayment on its investments and therefore incurs the commercial risk of its investments. In&#13;
addition to the key financial policies specified above, the Corporation's investments are subject to a number of operational or prudential limits, including limita-&#13;
tions on single project exposure, single country exposure, and segment concentration. Thus,&#13;
1. IFC does not normally finance for its own account more than 25% of a project's cost.&#13;
2. An equity investment in a company does not normally represent more than 35% of the company's total share capital, provided further that IFC is not the single&#13;
   largest shareholder.&#13;
3. An investment in a single project or entity may not exceed 3% of IFC's total investment portfolio.&#13;
4. Equity and quasi-equity investments in a single project or entity may not exceed 3% of the Corporation's net worth plus general reserves.&#13;
5. Total investments in a single country will not normally represent more than 12% of IFC's total investment portfolio or 25% of its net worth, whichever is lower.&#13;
6. The Corporation's total exposure to a single risk sector may not exceed 8% of the total investment portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
The quality of IFC's investment portfolio is monitored according to established supervision procedures. The portfolio management units of individual investment&#13;
departments are responsible for the day-to-day monitoring and management of commercial risk associated with projects originated by the departments,&#13;
including monitoring and evaluating credit quality of the borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
MANAGING CREDIT RISK; LOSS RESERVES&#13;
Credit risk refers to the potential for a borrower, or a counterparty to a transaction with IFC, to default on its financial obligations to the Corporation. IFC's Credit&#13;
Review Department analyzes information obtained from the investment departments and provides an independent review of the credit risk of IFC's borrowers.&#13;
     IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60 days unless man-&#13;
agement anticipates that collection of interest is expected in the near future.&#13;
     The amount of nonaccruing loans as a percentage of the disbursed loan portfolio, a key indicator of portfolio performance, increased to 15.2% at June 30,&#13;
2002, compared with 12.9% at June 30, 2001. The principal amount outstanding on nonaccrual loans totaled $1,217 million at June 30, 2002, an increase of&#13;
15% from the June 30, 2001, level of $1,054 million.&#13;
     The quality of IFC's investment portfolio deteriorated in FY02, mainly due to the increase in internal risk ratings of individual investments, with significant&#13;
deterioration in the quality of the Corporation's investments in Argentina, one of the Corporation's largest exposures. Other factors that the Corporation con-&#13;
siders in determining total reserves against losses on the disbursed investment portfolio remained fairly constant. As a result, total reserves against losses on&#13;
loans and equity investments at June 30, 2002, increased to $2,771 million ($2,213 million at June 30, 2001). This is equivalent to 25.8% of the disbursed port-&#13;
folio, a historical high for the Corporation and significantly higher than the 20.3% level at the end of FY01, then a historical high for the Corporation.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    Given the Corporation's limited history with financial guarantees, IFC is working under the assumption that the guarantee portfolio is exposed to the same&#13;
idiosyncratic and systematic risks as IFC's loan portfolio and the inherent, probable losses in the guarantee portfolio need to be covered by an allowance for&#13;
loss. IFC also accrues anticipated losses associated with its guarantee portfolio. Beginning in FY01, the Corporation established such an allowance. The&#13;
allowance at June 30, 2002, was $29 million ($13 million ­ June 30, 2001), based on the year-end portfolio, and is included in payables and other liabilities on&#13;
the balance sheet. The charge for the year, $16 million for FY02 ($13 million for FY01), is included in provisions for losses on loans, equity investments, and&#13;
guarantees in the income statement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                    9&#13;
&amp;#12;MANAGING LIQUIDITY RISK&#13;
The Corporation's Liquidity Policy, as approved by its Board of Directors, requires the maintenance at all times of sufficient liquidity (including liquid assets and&#13;
undrawn borrowing commitments from the World Bank) to cover at least 65% of its estimated net cash requirements for the next three years. As a prudential&#13;
measure, the Corporation maintains an operating liquidity target of not less than 70% of three years' net cash requirements, including projected disbursement&#13;
and debt service requirements. At June 30, 2002, the Corporation's liquidity level stood at $14.5 billion, or 109% of its projected net cash requirements for three&#13;
years ($13.3 billion, and 101% at June 30, 2001).&#13;
&#13;
MANAGING MARKET RISK&#13;
Market risk refers to changes in values of financial instruments or positions due to movements in interest or exchange rates, or to liquidity factors. IFC manages&#13;
market risk by adopting a matched-funding policy and by using a variety of derivative instruments to convert assets and liabilities into 6-month floating US dollar&#13;
assets and liabilities as detailed below. Implementation of the matched-funding policy is a two-step process: funds are earmarked at Board approval stage and&#13;
matched, with respect to interest rate and currency, at disbursement. This policy limits the Corporation's exposure to unmatched interest rate and exchange risks.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset investment activities&#13;
As noted above, the P1 and P3 portfolios have been generally invested, directly or synthetically, in floating-rate US dollar instruments. This reflects the&#13;
Corporation's matched-funding policy, which requires that all loans be funded with liabilities bearing similar interest rate and currency characteristics, and the&#13;
fact that its loans are predominantly denominated in floating-rate US dollars.&#13;
    Beginning in FY01, the Corporation began to manage interest rate risk in the P1 portfolio on a portfolio basis by investing in fixed or floating rate instruments&#13;
against a standard benchmark within specified risk parameters.&#13;
    The P2 portfolio is invested in fixed-rate US dollar-denominated instruments. Unlike the P1 portfolio, which accepts mostly credit risk, the P2 portfolio incurs&#13;
mainly market risk, with additional flexibility to deviate from its duration benchmark. The P0 portfolio is generally invested in short-dated deposits reflecting its&#13;
use for short-term funding requirements.&#13;
    IFC uses a variety of derivative instruments in its liquid asset management activities to manage the interest rate, currency, and other market risks associated&#13;
with certain of its liquid asset portfolios consistent with the Corporation's matched-funding policy. The derivative instruments used include short-term, over-the-&#13;
counter foreign exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. The&#13;
Corporation also takes both long and short positions in securities in the management of certain of its liquid asset portfolios to their respective benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowing activities&#13;
The Corporation issues debt securities in various capital markets in a variety of currencies, sometimes using complex structures. These structures include bor-&#13;
rowings payable in multiple currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a stock market index, a&#13;
reference interest rate, a commodity index, or one or more foreign exchange rates. Market risk associated with fixed rate obligations and structured instruments&#13;
is mitigated by using derivative instruments to convert them into variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with the Corporation's matched-funding policy.&#13;
&#13;
Lending activities&#13;
Currency and interest rate swaps are used in connection with the Corporation's lending activities to minimize the level of interest rate and currency exchange&#13;
risk in fixed- or floating-rate non-US dollar or fixed-rate US dollar lending.&#13;
&#13;
Client risk management activities&#13;
The Corporation offers risk management products to its clients and seeks to minimize its exposure to market risk resulting from derivative asset and liability man-&#13;
agement transactions with clients by entering into offsetting positions with highly rated market counterparties.&#13;
&#13;
Asset and liability management activities&#13;
While IFC's matched-funding policy provides a significant level of protection against currency and interest rate risk, the Corporation can be exposed to residual&#13;
market risk in its overall asset and liability management, which is monitored by the Asset-Liability Management group within the Corporation's Treasury&#13;
Department.&#13;
    The Corporation may be exposed to residual currency risk due to events such as changes in the level of non-US dollar loan loss reserves which it manages&#13;
by monitoring the aggregate position in each lending currency and hedging the exposure when the net asset or liability position exceeds $5 million equivalent&#13;
through spot sales or purchases.&#13;
&#13;
IFC also faces residual interest rate risk from two sources:&#13;
· Assets that are fully match-funded at inception can become mismatched over time due to write downs, prepayments, or rescheduling, and&#13;
· LIBOR reset dates on assets can differ from those on liabilities (this risk, however, is limited by synchronizing reset dates on assets and liabilities at a port-&#13;
  folio level).&#13;
    This residual interest rate risk is managed by measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point&#13;
change in interest rates, with a review trigger of $50,000 on this measure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 10&#13;
&amp;#12;MANAGING CREDIT RISK&#13;
Loans and equity investments&#13;
The risk of borrower default in connection with the Corporation's loans and equity investments is discussed above, under Managing commercial (project) risk.&#13;
&#13;
Treasury counterparty credit risk&#13;
Counterparty credit risk is the principal residual risk to the Corporation arising from its liquid assets and borrowing activities. IFC's credit policies set conser-&#13;
vative eligibility criteria for counterparties and diversification caps on exposure to individual counterparties. IFC currently restricts counterparty eligibility to banks&#13;
and financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of A by leading international credit rating agencies. In order to limit exposure to counterparties, IFC signs&#13;
collateral agreements with counterparties that require the posting of collateral when net exposure exceeds certain predetermined thresholds, which decrease&#13;
as a counterparty's credit rating deteriorates. Because counterparties can be downgraded during the life of a transaction, the agreements provide an option for&#13;
IFC to terminate all swaps if the counterparty is downgraded below investment grade or if other early termination events occur that are standard in the market.&#13;
     Limits are also imposed on the volume of over-the-counter derivative transactions with individual counterparties. IFC measures derivatives exposure to coun-&#13;
terparties in terms of "worst case" potential exposure based on simulations of market variables which are updated monthly to reflect market movements.&#13;
     These restrictions and limits are revised annually at the beginning of each fiscal year and approved by IFC's Finance and Risk Committee. During the year,&#13;
institution-specific limits are updated monthly based on changes in counterparty size or credit status. For exchange-traded instruments, IFC limits credit risk by&#13;
restricting transactions to a list of authorized exchanges, contracts and dealers, and by placing limits on the Corporation's open interest rate position in each&#13;
contract.&#13;
     Credit risks arising in connection with IFC's treasury activities are monitored and controlled in accordance with credit risk guidelines established by the&#13;
Corporation's Risk Management Group.&#13;
&#13;
Client risk management activities&#13;
The Corporation minimizes its credit risk exposure to clients with which it transacts derivative asset and liability management business by conducting credit&#13;
appraisals of the clients.&#13;
&#13;
MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK&#13;
Operational risk covers the risks emanating from the manner an entity is operated as opposed to the way it is financed. IFC has extended this definition of oper-&#13;
ational risk to be the potential for losses arising from internal activities or external events caused by breakdowns in information systems, communications, phys-&#13;
ical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing, and the execution of legal, fiduciary, and agency responsibilities.&#13;
     Like all financial institutions, IFC is exposed to many types of operational risks. It seeks to mitigate such risks by maintaining a comprehensive system of&#13;
internal controls that is designed not only to identify the parameters of various risks but also to monitor and control those areas of particular concern. The&#13;
Corporation has adopted the COSO1 control framework and a control self-assessment methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal controls, and it&#13;
has an ongoing program in place to cover all significant business operations. In each of the last seven fiscal years, IFC has obtained an attestation report from&#13;
its external auditors on its assertion that as of June 30 of each of the fiscal years, its system of internal control over external financial reporting met the criteria&#13;
for effective internal control described in COSO and that the Corporation's assertion is fairly stated in all material respects.&#13;
&#13;
During FY02, the Corporation undertook several ongoing initiatives, among other things, to manage operational risk. These included:&#13;
&#13;
1. Implementation of a first-stage review of IFC's back-office activities to identify sources of operational risk, define risk exposures, identify key risk factors qual-&#13;
   itatively and quantitatively, and deepen understanding of operational and enterprise risk management in a development bank (as distinct from a commercial&#13;
   or investment bank).&#13;
2. Implementation of a corporate business exposure and insurance review to identify the risks and assess the adequacy of existing insurance policies and limits.&#13;
   Discussions with insurance brokers and insurance consultants covered areas such as general liability, professional liability, bankers' blanket bond, directors&#13;
   and officers, environmental liability, and other categories.&#13;
3. Review of business continuity, disaster recovery planning, and crisis management preparations and procedures to meet the challenges of FY02, heightened&#13;
   by the tragic events of September 11th. In future, efforts to improve will continue in areas such as increased coordination within the World Bank Group to&#13;
   strengthen response capacity (in view of biological/chemical and nuclear threats) while achieving increased economies of scale.&#13;
4. Review of policies and practices to strengthen controls and improve guidance and communication to managers in various country offices.&#13;
5. Improvement of controls over donor-funded operations, by piloting new self-assessment checklists to assess a country office's or donor-funded office's com-&#13;
   pliance with procedures for transactions handled by the enterprise-wide systems for administrative and financial activities.&#13;
6. Continued design, development, and implementation of the Information Pyramid set of system streams. The underlying objective is to minimize redundant&#13;
   data and ensure a single corporate repository of operational and financial data that is consistent, comprehensive, and timely. This is supplemented by a Data&#13;
   Stabilization initiative and other related data integrity efforts.&#13;
7. Implementation of an environmental and social risk rating framework to provide an indication of the current level of environmental and social risk associated&#13;
   with a portfolio project.&#13;
8. Maintaining monthly closing procedures across departmental lines to minimize information flow breaks and ensure timeliness of financial reporting, with&#13;
   ex post exception reviews conducted as a further control.&#13;
&#13;

      COSO refers to the Internal Control-Integrated Framework formulated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission which was convened by the US Congress in&#13;
      response to the well-publicized irregularities that occurred in the financial sector during the late 1980s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                    11&#13;
&amp;#12;9. Planning for the major upgrade of the enterprise-wide system for processing administrative expenses, with an expected improvement in related staff effi-&#13;
    ciency. This upgrade is targeted for late in FY03, and is being accompanied by upgrading staff skills through a global training program and stricter recruit-&#13;
    ment criteria for Country Office staff. Consequently, improved control is to be achieved over financial accounting and administrative expense processing&#13;
    including budget, expense, travel, procurement, and leave and absence attendance administration.&#13;
10. Related initiatives emphasizing the area of operational risk management that were underway in FY01 and that continued in FY02 are as follows:&#13;
      a. IFC established an Operational Risk Management (ORM) Sounding Board and identified a framework for the prioritized review of key ORM compo-&#13;
         nents as part of IFC's implementation of the COSO methodology in FY02 and beyond.&#13;
      b. IFC continued to use the COBIT2 methodology to supplement the COSO review of the IT function--deemed a high-priority operational risk by the&#13;
         Sounding Board.&#13;
      c. IFC continued to use its online version of Operating Policies, Practices, and Guiding Principles, integrated with the Corporation's Operational&#13;
         Procedures, so that staff can consult the latest comprehensive version easily.&#13;
      d. Independent reviews of the financial, administrative, and organizational structure of IFC Trust Funded Facilities continued into FY02. Such reviews have&#13;
         resulted in improved controls, information flows, and donor reporting.&#13;
      e. Streamlined and central equity sale procedures have been formulated by the Corporation's Portfolio Management Department, internally cleared with&#13;
         all concerned parties, and were implemented in late FY02 by the Corporation's central Equity Management Desk. This activity is being conducted on a&#13;
         pilot basis through the end of FY03.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VI. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES&#13;
The Notes to the FY02 financial statements contain a summary of the Corporation's significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued&#13;
accounting pronouncements. Certain of these policies are considered to be "critical" to the portrayal of the Corporation's financial condition, since they require&#13;
management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. These policies include deter-&#13;
mining the level of the allowance for losses in the loan and equity investment portfolios, and valuation of certain financial instruments with no quoted market&#13;
prices. Additional information about these policies can be found in Notes A, C, and M to the FY02 financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
RESERVE AGAINST LOSSES FOR LOANS AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS&#13;
The Corporation considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all&#13;
amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. The reserve against losses for impaired loans reflects management's judgment of the present value of&#13;
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. The Corporation establishes a reserve against losses for equity investments when a&#13;
decrease in value of the investments has occurred which is considered other than temporary. The reserve against losses for loans and equity investments&#13;
includes an estimate of probable losses on loans and equity investments inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable. The reserve is established&#13;
through periodic charges to income in the form of a provision for losses on loans and equity investments. Investments written off, as well as any subsequent&#13;
recoveries, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
    The assessment of the adequacy of total reserves against losses for loans and equity investments is highly dependent on management's judgment about fac-&#13;
tors such as geographical concentration, industry, regional and macroeconomic conditions, and historical trends. The reserve against losses on equity invest-&#13;
ments also considers the management quality of the investee company and its financial condition. Due to the inherent limitation of any particular estimation&#13;
technique, management utilizes three different and independent methods to provide estimates for the total loss reserve balance: (1) a simulation model,&#13;
(2) country risk ratings and probability of crisis associated with those risks, and (3) a model of the Corporation's long-term historical portfolio experience.&#13;
Changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on the provision and could result in a change in the reserve balance.&#13;
    The reserve against losses on loans and equity investments is separately reported in the balance sheet as a deduction of the Corporation's total loans and&#13;
equity investments. Increases or decreases in the reserve level are reported in the income statement as provision for losses on loans, equity investments, and&#13;
guarantees. The reserve against losses on loans and equity investments relates only to the Client Services segment of the Corporation (see Note O to the FY02&#13;
financial statements for further discussion of the Corporation's business segments).&#13;
&#13;
VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH NO QUOTED MARKET PRICES&#13;
As part of its compliance with SFAS No. 133, the Corporation reports at fair value all of its derivative instruments and certain borrowings which the Corporation&#13;
has designated as components of fair value hedges. In addition, certain features in various loan agreements, equity investment agreements, and borrowing con-&#13;
tracts contain embedded derivatives that, for accounting purposes, are separately accounted as either derivative assets or liabilities, including puts, caps, floors,&#13;
and forwards. Few of these instruments have a ready market valuation. Therefore, the fair values of the financial instruments with no quoted market prices are&#13;
estimated using sophisticated pricing models of the net present value of estimated future cash flows. Management makes numerous assumptions in developing&#13;
the pricing models, including the appropriate discount rates, interest rates, and related volatility and expected movement in foreign currency exchange rates.&#13;
Changes in assumptions could have a significant impact on the amounts reported as assets and liabilities and the related gains and losses reported in the income&#13;
statement. The fair value computations affect both the Client Services and Treasury segments of the Corporation (see Note O to the FY02 financial statements&#13;
for further discussion of the Corporation's business segments).&#13;
&#13;
Additional information can be found in Notes A and M to the FY02 financial statements.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Elements                                               Significant influences&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Operating income:&#13;
Spread on interest earning assets                       Nonaccruals and recoveries of interest on loans formerly in nonaccrual status and income&#13;

&#13;
Noninterest income and expense                          Level of technical assistance and advisory services provided by the Corporation to its clients,&#13;
                                                        the level of income from the staff retirement and other benefits plans, and the approved administrative&#13;
                                                        and other budgets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Net income:&#13;
Other unrealized gains and                              Principally, differences between changes in fair values of derivative instruments and changes in fair value&#13;
losses on financial instruments                         of hedged items in fair value hedging relationships&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the Corporation's FY01 net income reflects the one-time impact of adopting SFAS No. 133.&#13;
&#13;
   The following paragraphs detail significant variances between FY02 and FY01, and FY01 and FY00, covering the periods included in the Corporation's&#13;
FY02 financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
FY02 VERSUS FY01&#13;
Operating income&#13;
The Corporation's operating income for FY02 was $161 million, substantially lower than FY01's operating income of $241 million. The decline was mainly attrib-&#13;
utable to the significant charge for provisions for losses on loans, equity investments, and guarantees, which reflected the downturn in portfolio quality in FY02,&#13;
principally in Argentina, one of the Corporation's largest portfolio countries. Such provisions totaled $657 million in FY02 as compared with $402 million in FY01.&#13;
Capital gains on equity sales partially offset the negative effect on operating income of such provisions. FY02 capital gains were $288 million as compared with&#13;
$91 million in FY01 due to targeted sales of a small number of equity investments in certain markets which had reached pre-determined sales trigger levels.&#13;
&#13;
Net interest income&#13;
IFC's primary interest earning assets are its loan portfolio and its liquid assets portfolios. After charges on borrowings are taken into account, net interest income&#13;
improved by $58 million or 11% from $544 million in FY01 to $602 million in FY02.&#13;
     Interest and financial fees (including guarantee fees) for FY02 were $562 million, compared with $715 million for FY01, a decrease of 21%. The disbursed&#13;
and outstanding loan portfolio declined marginally by 2%, and the Corporation's nonperforming loan rate was higher in FY02 than in FY01. Loans in nonaccrual&#13;
status grew from $1,054 million at June 30, 2001 to $1,217 million at June 30, 2002, an increase of 15%. Interest and financial fees benefited in FY02 from net&#13;
recoveries of interest on loans in nonaccrual status, related to current and prior years of $39 million ($27 million ­ FY01). In addition, as discussed in Note E to&#13;
the FY02 financial statements, the Corporation recorded income of $15 million in FY02, included in interest and financial fees from loans, as a result of exer-&#13;
cising an option to reacquire the remaining outstanding loan participations owned by a trust, and the subsequent dissolution of the trust.&#13;
     Interest income from time deposits and securities for FY02 was $478 million, $312 million lower than the $790 million recorded in FY01. The liquid assets&#13;
portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities, grew from $13.3 billion at June 30, 2001, to $14.5 billion, largely funded by the growth in the&#13;
Corporation's borrowings program, proceeds from sales of equity securities, and the slower pace of loan and equity disbursements experienced in FY02, con-&#13;
tinuing the trend experienced in FY01. The $1.2 billion growth in the liquid assets portfolio partially offset the negative effect of the overall declining interest rate&#13;
environment experienced in FY02 on interest income from time deposits and securities.&#13;
     The Corporation's charges on borrowings fell by $523 million during FY02 from $961 million to $438 million, largely reflecting the declining US dollar interest&#13;
rate environment, partially offset by the growth of the borrowings portfolio. After the effect of associated derivative financial instruments, the borrowings port-&#13;
folio grew by $0.3 billion in FY02 from $16.6 billion at June 30, 2001, to $16.9 billion at June 30, 2002.&#13;

                                                                                                                                                                   13&#13;
&amp;#12;Net gains and losses on trading activities&#13;
Due to the overall decline in the US dollar interest rate environment in FY02, and the favorable impact of this decline on the carrying value of the Corporation's&#13;
fixed income liquid asset investments, the Corporation recorded net realized and unrealized gains on its liquid asset portfolios of $31 million, lower than the net&#13;
realized and unrealized gains of $87 million recorded in FY01, which was characterized by a steeper declining interest rate environment than experienced in FY02.&#13;
&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
Overall income from the equity investment portfolio was higher by $206 million, or 93%, from $222 million in FY01 to $428 million in FY02.&#13;
    The Corporation generated capital gains for FY02 of $288 million as compared with $91 million for FY01, an increase of 216%. Capital gains, while strong&#13;
in FY02, were highly concentrated, with $227 million of the total capital gains of $288 million resulting from sales or partial sales of six equity investments in&#13;
Korea, Mexico, Peru, and Latvia. Dividend income was marginally higher in FY02 at $140 million, as compared with $131 million in FY01. Consistent with FY01,&#13;
the stable performance in dividend income in FY02 was largely attributable to returns on the Corporation's joint ventures in the oil, gas, and mining sectors.&#13;
&#13;
Provisions for losses on loans, equity investments, and guarantees&#13;
The income charge for provisions for losses of $657 million in FY02, including $16 million in respect of guarantees, was significantly higher than the charge in&#13;
FY01 of $402 million (which included $13 million in respect of guarantees), a growth of $255 million or 63%. On June 30, 2002, the Corporation's total reserves&#13;
against losses on loans and equity investments were 25.8% of the disbursed and outstanding portfolio (20.3% at June 30, 2001).&#13;
&#13;
Noninterest income&#13;
Noninterest income of $114 million for FY02 was $2 million lower than in FY01 ($116 million), principally due to lower pension income from the Staff Retirement&#13;
Plan and the cost to the Corporation of other postretirement benefit plans, which fell from $47 million in FY01 to $31 million in FY02. Service fees in FY02 were&#13;
substantially unchanged at $40 million, as compared with $41 million in FY01. Other income, principally fees collected from clients for reimbursement of&#13;
expenses incurred by the Corporation, was $43 million in FY02 as compared with $28 million in FY01.&#13;
&#13;
Noninterest expense&#13;
Administrative expenses (the principal component of noninterest expense) rose 8% from $304 million in FY01 to $327 million in FY02. Excluding the grossing-&#13;
up effect of certain revenues and expenses attributable to the Corporation's reimbursable program ($39 million in FY02, as compared with $24 million in FY01)&#13;
as noted above, and the impact of a reorganization effected in FY02 ($13 million in FY02, as compared with $nil in FY01), administrative expenses, the largest&#13;
component of noninterest expense, fell by $5 million, from $280 million in FY01 to $275 million in FY02. This decrease was largely attributable to the effect of&#13;
a series of efficiency and effectiveness measures implemented in the second half of FY02. These measures were taken as part of IFC's overall reorganization&#13;
and also to address the impact on operating income of the emerging crisis in Argentina.&#13;
     As noted above, the Corporation undertook a reorganization of its investment departments in FY02. Administrative expenses include a charge of $13 mil-&#13;
lion for this in FY02. The reorganization involved staff reductions, field office closings and reorganizations, and a headquarters reorganization. The reorganiza-&#13;
tion was finalized and announced in the fourth quarter of FY02, and the Corporation currently estimates that the implementation of the plan will commence and&#13;
conclude during FY03. Further details of the costs associated with the reorganization are included in Note R to the Corporation's FY02 financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Net income&#13;
As more fully disclosed in Notes A, L, and M to the Corporation's FY02 financial statements, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for derivative&#13;
instruments to conform with SFAS No. 133 beginning in FY01. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the Corporation has designated certain hedging relationships in its&#13;
borrowing activities and its lending activities as fair value hedges. The Corporation generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific&#13;
underlying financial instruments hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other features. However, differing valuation&#13;
methodologies are applied to the derivative and the hedged financial instrument, as prescribed by SFAS No. 133. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for&#13;
such relationships is recorded in other unrealized gains on financial instruments in net income.&#13;
    The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income FY02 and FY01 can be summarized as follows (US$ millions):&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               FY02       FY01&#13;
Operating income                                                                               161         241&#13;
SFAS No. 133 adjustments:&#13;
 Other unrealized gains on financial instruments                                                 54         11&#13;
 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle                                              -         93&#13;
Net income                                                                                     215         345&#13;
&#13;
    The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle (the transition adjustment) comprises the difference between the previous balance sheet car-&#13;
rying value and the fair value of all freestanding derivatives together with the offsetting gains and losses on assets and liabilities held under hedging relation-&#13;
ships in existence prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133.&#13;
    Other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments largely comprises the difference between the change in fair value of derivative instruments and&#13;
the change in fair value of the hedged item under designated hedging relationships.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 14&#13;
&amp;#12;FY01 VERSUS FY00&#13;
Operating income&#13;
The Corporation's operating income for FY01 was $241 million, substantially lower than FY00's operating income of $380 million. FY01 operating income,&#13;
unlike prior years, reflected unrealized gains and losses on the P1 and P2 liquid asset portfolios due to the change in classification of these portfolios from avail-&#13;
able for sale to trading on July 1, 2000. The decline was mainly attributable to significant provisions for losses on loans, equity investments and guarantees,&#13;
reflecting the downturn in portfolio quality in FY01. In addition, due to the tough economic conditions in the markets in which IFC operates, realized capital gains&#13;
were significantly lower in FY01 than in FY00. Offsetting these negative factors were strong realized and unrealized gains on the Corporation's liquid asset&#13;
trading activities, which benefited considerably from the recent declining interest rate environment.&#13;
&#13;
Net interest income&#13;
IFC's primary interest earning assets are its loan portfolio and its liquid assets portfolios. After charges on borrowings are taken into account, net interest income&#13;
improved by $28 million or 5% from $516 million in FY00 to $544 million in FY01.&#13;
     Interest and financial fees for FY01 were $715 million, compared with $694 million for FY00, an increase of 3%. The disbursed and outstanding loan port-&#13;
folio declined marginally by 1%, and the Corporation's interest collection rate was lower in FY01 than in FY00. Loans in nonaccrual status grew from $922 mil-&#13;
lion at June 30, 2000, to $1,054 million at June 30, 2001, an increase of 14%.&#13;
     Interest income from time deposits and securities for FY01 was $790 million, $156 million higher than the $634 million recorded in FY00. The liquid assets&#13;
portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities, grew from $12.2 billion at June 30, 2000, to $13.3 billion, largely funded by the growth in the&#13;
Corporation's borrowings program and the slower pace of loan and equity disbursements experienced in FY01. The $1.1 billion growth in the portfolio offset&#13;
the negative effect of the declining interest rate environment experienced throughout much of FY01 on interest income from time deposits and securities.&#13;
     The Corporation's charges on borrowings grew by $149 million during FY01 from $812 million to $961 million, largely reflecting the growth of the borrow-&#13;
ings portfolio, offset by the effect of the declining interest rate environment. After the effect of associated derivative financial instruments, the borrowings port-&#13;
folio grew by $0.8 billion in FY01, from $15.8 billion at June 30, 2000, to $16.6 billion at June 30, 2001.&#13;
&#13;
Net gains and losses on trading activities&#13;
As previously noted, up to and including FY00, unrealized gains and losses on the Corporation's P1 and P2 liquid asset portfolios were excluded from net&#13;
income until realized. Effective July 1, 2000, the Corporation reclassified these portfolios from available for sale to trading and now reflects unrealized gains and&#13;
losses on these portfolios in net income.&#13;
    Due to the declining interest rate environment in FY01, and the favorable impact of this on the carrying value of the Corporation's fixed income liquid asset&#13;
investments, the Corporation recorded net unrealized gains on its liquid asset portfolios of $87 million.&#13;
&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
Overall income from the equity investment portfolio declined by $40 million, or 15%, from $262 million in FY00 to $222 million in FY01.&#13;
    The Corporation generated capital gains for FY01 of $91 million as compared with $132 million for FY00, a decline of 31%. Dividend income, however, was&#13;
substantially unchanged at $131 million for FY01 as compared with $130 million for FY00. Consistent with FY00, the stable performance in dividend income in&#13;
FY01 was largely attributable to the continuing high level of oil prices during much of FY01, which significantly improved returns on the Corporation's joint ven-&#13;
tures in oil, gas, and mining.&#13;
&#13;
Provisions for losses on loans, equity investments and guarantees&#13;
The income charge for provisions for losses of $402 million in FY01, which included $13 million in respect of guarantees, was significantly higher than the&#13;
charge in FY00 of $215 million, a growth of $187 million or 87%. On June 30, 2001 the Corporation's total reserves against losses on loans and equity invest-&#13;
ments were 20.3% of the disbursed and outstanding portfolio (18.0% at June 30, 2000).&#13;
&#13;
Noninterest income&#13;
Noninterest income of $116 million for FY01 was $9 million lower than in FY00 ($125 million), principally due to the sale of assets, including assets associated&#13;
with the Corporation's information provision business in FY00 that did not recur in FY01. Service fees were also lower at $41 million for FY01 as compared with&#13;
$49 million for FY00.&#13;
    Offsetting these negative factors, there was an increase in net periodic pension income from the Staff Retirement Plan and from the change in the&#13;
Corporation's share of net assets held for postretirement benefits, from $45 million in FY00 to $47 million in FY01.&#13;
&#13;
Noninterest expense&#13;
Administrative expenses (the principal component of noninterest expense) rose 15% from $265 million in FY00 to $304 million in FY01. This increase was&#13;
in line with budget funding of the anticipated growth in the investment portfolio and the continuing move into smaller investments in frontier countries within&#13;
IFC's portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
Net income and the impact of new accounting standards&#13;
As discussed above, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments to conform with SFAS No. 133 beginning in FY01. The effects&#13;
of SFAS No. 133 on net income for the year ended June 30, 2001 were to increase net income by $104 million. There was no impact on FY00 net income, as&#13;
the implementation of SFAS No. 133 occurred in FY01.&#13;

&#13;
       RESPONSIBILITY FOR EXTERNAL FINANCIAL REPORTING&#13;
&#13;
       The external financial statements and related financial information in the IFC annual report, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, were&#13;
       prepared by the management of IFC. In doing so, management applied generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and&#13;
       also exercised its judgement and made estimates in those instances where they were deemed appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
       In assuming its responsibility both for the integrity and fairness of financial information, management maintains a system of internal con-&#13;
       trols designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Board of Executive Directors and member countries that assets are safeguarded,&#13;
       transactions are properly executed and recorded in accordance with management's authorizations, and accounting records are reliable&#13;
       for preparing accurate, published financial statements. Management uses its judgement balancing the costs of systems of internal&#13;
       accounting controls and the benefits to be derived from them. The systems of internal accounting controls are continually modified and&#13;
       improved in response to changes in business conditions and operations.&#13;
&#13;
       Key procedures that Management has established and which are designed to provide effective internal financial control within the IFC&#13;
       include the preparation, review and Board approval of annual financial plans that align with strategic plans prepared every year. Results&#13;
       are monitored regularly and reports on progress compared to the plan are prepared quarterly. Additionally, systems are in place to mon-&#13;
       itor financial risks such as changes in the market prices of financial instruments, funding of assets, operational error and fraud. Exposure&#13;
       to these risks is monitored by the IFC Finance and Risk Committee.1 Further, the system of internal controls includes written policies and&#13;
       procedures, proper delegation of authority, accountability through establishing responsibility centers, and segregation of duties.&#13;
&#13;
       The effectiveness of IFC's systems of internal accounting controls is monitored throughout the year by management in its ongoing over-&#13;
       sight role, through the conduct of control risk self assessments, and by an established program of internal audit carried out by the World&#13;
       Bank Group Internal Auditing Department. Management believes that IFC's internal controls for external financial reporting, which are&#13;
       subject to close scrutiny by Management and by internal auditors and are revised as considered necessary, support the integrity and relia-&#13;
       bility of the external financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
       Further, the external financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2002, were audited by external auditors who, in the course of their&#13;
       work, considered the internal control structure to obtain an understanding of it sufficient to plan the audit and to determine the nature,&#13;
       timing, and extent of audit procedures performed. However, an audit is not designed to provide assurance on the internal control system&#13;
       or to identify reportable conditions.&#13;
&#13;
       The Board of Directors of IFC has appointed an Audit Committee responsible for monitoring the accounting practices and internal con-&#13;
       trols of the Corporation. The Audit Committee meets periodically with Management and our internal auditors to discuss the work of each.&#13;
       Both the internal auditors and the external auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee to discuss the audits and any accounting&#13;
       controls or financial accounting and reporting matters.&#13;
&#13;
       Even an effective internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations ­ including the possibility of the circum-&#13;
       vention or overriding of controls ­ and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to external financial statement&#13;
       preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, internal control system effectiveness may vary over time.&#13;
&#13;
       IFC assessed its internal control system as of June 30, 2002 in relation to criteria for effective internal control over external financial&#13;
       reporting described in Internal Control ­ Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the&#13;
       Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, IFC believes that, as of June 30, 2002, its system of internal control over external finan-&#13;
       cial reporting met those criteria.&#13;

&amp;#12;NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
PURPOSE&#13;
&#13;
The International Finance Corporation (the Corporation), an international organization, was established in 1956 to further economic development in its member&#13;
countries by encouraging the growth of private enterprise. The Corporation is a member of the World Bank Group, which also includes the International Bank&#13;
for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The&#13;
Corporation's activities are closely coordinated with and complement the overall development objectives of the other World Bank Group institutions. The&#13;
Corporation, together with private investors, assists in financing the establishment, improvement, and expansion of private sector enterprises by making loans&#13;
and equity investments where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. The Corporation's share capital is provided by its member&#13;
countries. It raises most of the funds for its investment activities through the issuance of notes, bonds and other debt securities in the international capital&#13;
markets. The Corporation also plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional project funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or&#13;
through loan syndications, underwritings, and guarantees. In addition to project finance and resource mobilization, the Corporation offers an array of financial&#13;
and technical advisory services to private businesses in the developing world to increase their chances of success. It also advises governments on how to create&#13;
an environment hospitable to the growth of private enterprise and foreign investment.&#13;
&#13;
NOTE A ­ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP).&#13;
On August 8, 2002, the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved these financial statements for issue.&#13;
&#13;
Financial statements presentation - Certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.&#13;
&#13;
Use of estimates - The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of&#13;
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense&#13;
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A significant degree of judgment has been used in the determination of: the&#13;
adequacy of the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments; estimated fair values of all derivative instruments and related financial instruments in&#13;
qualifying hedging relationships; and net periodic pension income. There are inherent risks and uncertainties related to the Corporation's operations.&#13;
The possibility exists that changing economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
As part of the ongoing compliance with US Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging&#13;
Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivatives and Certain Hedging Relationships (collectively SFAS No. 133), certain internal&#13;
valuation models are used to determine the fair values of derivative and other financial instruments. The Corporation undertakes continuous review and respeci-&#13;
fication of these models with the objective of refining its estimates of fair value, consistent with evolving best market practices. Changes in fair value resulting&#13;
from refinements in the assumptions and methodologies incorporated in the models are reflected in net income in the period in which the enhanced models are&#13;
first applied.&#13;
&#13;
Translation of currencies - Assets and liabilities not denominated in United States dollars (US dollars or $), other than disbursed equity investments, are&#13;
expressed in US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at June 30, 2002, and June 30, 2001. Disbursed equity investments are expressed in US dollars at the&#13;
prevailing exchange rates at the time of disbursement. Income and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction.&#13;
Translation gains and losses are credited or charged to income.&#13;
&#13;
Loans and equity investments - Loans and equity investments are recorded as assets when disbursed. Loans are carried at the principal amounts outstanding.&#13;
Where loans are part of a designated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying value is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable&#13;
to the risk being hedged. These adjustments are reported in other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments in net income. It is the Corporation's&#13;
practice to obtain collateral security such as, but not limited to, mortgages and third-party guarantees. Equity investments are carried at cost. The Corporation&#13;
enters into put and call option agreements in connection with equity investments; these are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133.&#13;
&#13;
Reserve against losses on loans and equity investments - The Corporation recognizes portfolio impairment in the balance sheet through the reserve against&#13;
losses on loans and equity investments, recording a provision or release of provision for losses on loans and equity investments in net income on a quarterly&#13;
basis, which increases or decreases the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments.&#13;
&#13;
Management determines the aggregate level of the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments, taking into account established guidelines and its&#13;
assessment of recent portfolio quality trends. The guidelines comprise simulation techniques, internal country risk ratings, and the impairment potential of the&#13;
portfolio based on the Corporation's historical portfolio write-off and loss reserve experience on mature investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                              25&#13;
&amp;#12;NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued&#13;
&#13;
The reserve against losses on loans and equity investments reflects estimates of both probable losses already identified and probable losses inherent in the&#13;
portfolio but not specifically identifiable. The determination of identified probable losses represents management's judgment of the creditworthiness of the&#13;
borrower or the value of the company invested in and is established through review of individual loans and equity investments undertaken on a quarterly basis.&#13;
The Corporation considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all&#13;
amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. A reserve against losses for an equity investment is established when a decrease in value of the equity&#13;
investment has occurred that is considered other than temporary. Unidentified probable losses are the aggregate probable losses over a one-year risk horizon,&#13;
in excess of identified probable losses. The risks inherent in the portfolio that are considered in determining unidentified probable losses are those proven to&#13;
exist by past experience and include: country systemic risk; the risk of correlation or contagion of losses between markets; uninsured and uninsurable risks;&#13;
nonperformance under guarantees and support agreements; and opacity of, or misrepresentation in, financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Revenue recognition on loans and equity investments - Interest income and commitment fees on loans are recorded as income on an accrual basis. All other&#13;
fees are recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies. The Corporation does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt&#13;
or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60 days unless management anticipates that collection of interest will occur in the near future.&#13;
Any interest accrued on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is reversed out of income and is thereafter recognized as income only when the actual payment is&#13;
received. Interest not previously recognized but capitalized as part of a debt restructuring is recorded as deferred income, included in the balance sheet in&#13;
payables and other liabilities, and credited to income only when the related principal is received. Such capitalized interest is considered in the computation of&#13;
the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments in the balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Dividends and profit participations are recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies. Capital gains on the sale or redemption of equity&#13;
investments are measured against the average cost of the investments sold and are recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies.&#13;
&#13;
Guarantees - The Corporation extends guarantee facilities to its clients to provide credit enhancement for their debt securities and trade obligations. Under the&#13;
terms of the guarantees, the Corporation agrees to assume responsibility for the client's financial obligations in the event of default by the client.&#13;
The Corporation's guarantee agreements do not meet the definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133. Guarantees are regarded as outstanding when the&#13;
underlying financial obligation of the client is incurred, and called when the Corporation's obligation under the guarantee has been invoked. Not meeting the&#13;
definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133, guarantees remain off balance sheet while outstanding; when called, the amount disbursed is recorded as a new&#13;
loan. A liability is established for probable losses on outstanding guarantees and is included in payables and other liabilities on the balance sheet. Specific&#13;
reserves are established on called guarantees and are included in the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments on the balance sheet. Commitment&#13;
fees on guarantees are recorded as income on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolio - The Corporation's liquid funds are invested in government and agency obligations, time deposits, and asset-backed securities.&#13;
Government and agency obligations include long and short positions in highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills and other obligations issued or unconditionally&#13;
guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities including government agencies and instrumentalities or by multilateral organizations. The liquid&#13;
asset portfolio, as defined by the Corporation and as detailed in note B, comprises: these time deposits and securities; related derivative instruments; securi-&#13;
ties purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements and payable for cash collateral received; receivables from sales of secu-&#13;
rities and payables for purchases of securities; and related accrued income and charges.&#13;
&#13;
On July 1, 2000, the Corporation reclassified all of its available for sale securities as trading securities. This resulted in a transfer of accumulated net unrealized&#13;
holding losses on available for sale securities of $5 million from other comprehensive income to net income in the year ended June 30, 2001. Beginning with the&#13;
year ended June 30, 2001, realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are reported separately in the income statement.&#13;
&#13;
Trading securities are carried at fair value with any changes in fair value reported in net gains and losses on trading activities. Interest on securities and amorti-&#13;
zation of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in interest from time deposits and securities.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation classifies due from banks, time deposits, and securities (collectively, cash and cash equivalents) as an element of liquidity in the statement of&#13;
cash flows because they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash within 90 days.&#13;
&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements - Repurchase agreements are contracts under which a party sells securities and simultaneously agrees to repurchase&#13;
the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Resale agreements are contracts under which a party purchases securities and simultaneously&#13;
agrees to resell the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price.&#13;
&#13;
It is the Corporation's policy to take possession of securities purchased under resale agreements, which are primarily liquid government securities. The market&#13;
value of these securities is monitored and, within parameters defined in the agreements, additional collateral is obtained when their value declines. The&#13;
Corporation also monitors its exposure with respect to securities sold under repurchase agreements and, in accordance with the terms of the agreements,&#13;
requests the return of excess securities held by the counterparty when their value increases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 26&#13;
&amp;#12;NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued&#13;
&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amount at which the securities were acquired&#13;
or sold plus accrued interest. Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities payable for cash&#13;
collateral received are recorded at fair value.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings - To diversify its access to funding and reduce its borrowing costs, the Corporation borrows in a variety of currencies and uses a number of&#13;
borrowing structures, including foreign exchange rate-linked, inverse floating rate and zero coupon notes. Generally, the Corporation simultaneously converts&#13;
such borrowings into variable rate US dollar borrowings through the use of currency and interest rate swap transactions. Under certain outstanding borrowing&#13;
agreements, the Corporation is not permitted to mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its assets (other than purchase money security interests) without&#13;
extending equivalent security to the holders of such borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings are recorded at the amount repayable at maturity, adjusted for unamortized premium and unaccreted discount. Where borrowings are part of a&#13;
designated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying amount is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.&#13;
Adjustments for changes in fair value attributable to hedged risks are reported in other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments in the income&#13;
statement. Interest on borrowings and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in charges on borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
Risk management, derivative instruments, and hedge accounting - The Corporation enters into transactions in various derivative instruments for financial risk&#13;
management purposes in connection with its principal business activities, including lending, client risk management, borrowing, liquid asset portfolio manage-&#13;
ment, and asset and liability management. The Corporation does not use derivatives for speculative, marketing, or merchandising purposes.&#13;
&#13;
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Where they are not clearly and closely related&#13;
to the host contract, derivative instruments embedded in loans, equity investments, and market borrowing transactions entered into on or after January 1, 1999&#13;
are bifurcated from the host contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets and liabilities. The value at inception of these embedded derivatives is&#13;
excluded from the carrying value of the host contracts on the balance sheet. Changes in fair values of derivative instruments used in liquid asset portfolio&#13;
management activities are recorded in net gains and losses on trading activities. Changes in fair values of derivative instruments other than those used in liquid&#13;
asset portfolio management activities are recorded in other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments. Prior to July 1, 2000, changes in fair values of&#13;
derivative instruments associated with the liquid asset portfolio classified as available for sale were included in other comprehensive income until realized, and&#13;
those associated with the liquid asset portfolio classified as trading were included in net income.&#13;
&#13;
Subject to certain specific qualifying conditions in SFAS No. 133, a derivative instrument may be designated either as a hedge of the fair value of an asset or&#13;
liability (fair value hedge), or as a hedge of the variability of cash flows of an asset or liability or forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge). For a derivative instru-&#13;
ment qualifying as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument are reported in net income, together with offsetting fair value gains&#13;
or losses on the hedged item that are attributable to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument qualifying as a cash flow hedge, fair value gains or losses&#13;
associated with the risk being hedged are reported in other comprehensive income and released to net income in the period(s) in which the effect on net income&#13;
of the hedged item is recorded. Fair value gains and losses on a derivative instrument not qualifying as a hedge are reported in net income.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing and lending activities as fair value hedges. The Corporation generally matches&#13;
the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying financial instruments hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest&#13;
rates, and other features. However, the valuation methodologies applied to the derivative and the hedged financial instrument, as prescribed by SFAS No. 133,&#13;
may differ. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships is recorded in other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments in the&#13;
income statement.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has not designated any hedging relationships as cash flow hedges.&#13;
&#13;
The risk management policy for each of the Corporation's principal business activities and the accounting policies particular to them are described below.&#13;
&#13;
Lending activities The Corporation's policy is to closely match the currency, rate basis, and maturity of its loans and borrowings. Derivative instruments are used&#13;
to convert the cash flows from fixed rate US dollar or non-US dollar loans into variable rate US dollars. The impact on net income of changes in fair value of&#13;
interest rate swaps qualifying for the shortcut method under SFAS No. 133 is exactly offset by a corresponding adjustment to the fair value of the related loans.&#13;
The Corporation has elected not to designate hedging relationships for all other lending-related derivatives that do not qualify for the shortcut method.&#13;
&#13;
Client risk management activities The Corporation enters into derivatives transactions with its clients to help them hedge their own currency, interest rate, or com-&#13;
modity risk, which, in turn, improves the overall quality of the Corporation's loan portfolio. To hedge the market risks that arise from these transactions with clients,&#13;
the Corporation enters into offsetting derivative transactions with matching terms with authorized market counterparties. Changes in fair value of all derivatives&#13;
associated with these activities are reflected currently in net income. Though hedge accounting is not applicable to these activities, the matching of terms between&#13;
the offsetting transactions minimizes the impact on net income. Fees and spreads charged on these transactions are recorded as income on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Borrowing activities The Corporation issues debt securities in various capital markets with the objectives of minimizing its borrowing costs, diversifying funding&#13;
sources, and developing member countries' capital markets, sometimes using complex structures. These structures include borrowings payable in multiple cur-&#13;
rencies, or borrowings with principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a stock market index, a reference interest rate, a com-&#13;
modity index, or one or more foreign exchange rates. The Corporation uses derivative instruments with matching terms, primarily currency and interest rate&#13;
swaps, to convert such borrowings into variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with the Corporation's matched funding policy. The Corporation has des-&#13;
ignated the majority of derivatives associated with borrowing activities as fair value hedges of the underlying borrowings. There are a small number of cash flow-&#13;
like hedging transactions for which no hedge relationship has been designated.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolio management activities The Corporation manages the interest rate, currency, and other market risks associated with certain of the time&#13;
deposits and securities in its liquid asset portfolio by entering into derivative transactions to convert the cash flows from those instruments into variable rate US&#13;
dollars, consistent with the Corporation's matched funding policy. The derivative instruments used include short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange for-&#13;
wards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. As the entire liquid asset portfolio is clas-&#13;
sified as a trading portfolio, all securities (including derivatives) are carried at fair value, and no hedging relationships have been designated.&#13;
&#13;
Asset and liability management In addition to the risk managed in the context of its business activities detailed above, the Corporation faces residual market risk&#13;
in its overall asset and liability management. Residual currency risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate position in each lending currency and eliminating&#13;
the net excess asset or liability position through spot sales or purchases. Interest rate risk due to reset date mismatches is reduced by synchronizing the reset&#13;
dates on assets and liabilities and managing overall interest rate risk on an aggregate basis. Interest rate risk arising from mismatches due to writedowns, pre-&#13;
payments and reschedulings, and residual reset date mismatches is monitored by measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and liabilities in each&#13;
currency to each basis point change in interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation monitors the credit risk associated with these activities by careful assessment and monitoring of prospective and actual clients and counter-&#13;
parties. In respect of liquid assets and derivatives transactions, credit risk is managed by establishing exposure limits based on the credit rating and size of the&#13;
individual counterparty. In addition, the Corporation has entered into master agreements governing derivative transactions that contain close-out and netting pro-&#13;
visions and collateral arrangements. Under these agreements, if the Corporation's credit exposure to a counterparty, on a mark-to-market basis, exceeds a spec-&#13;
ified level, the counterparty must post collateral to cover the excess, generally in the form of liquid government securities.&#13;
&#13;
Resource mobilization - The Corporation mobilizes funds from commercial banks and other financial institutions (Participants) by facilitating loan participations,&#13;
without recourse. These loan participations are administered and serviced by the Corporation on behalf of the Participants. The disbursed and outstanding bal-&#13;
ances of the loan participations are not included in the Corporation's balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Pension and other postretirement benefits - IBRD has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP), and a Post-&#13;
Employment Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of its staff members as well as the staff of the Corporation and of MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees.&#13;
The PEBP provides pension benefits administered outside the SRP. All costs associated with these plans are allocated between IBRD, the Corporation, and&#13;
MIGA based upon their employees' respective participation in the plans. In addition, the Corporation and MIGA reimburse IBRD for their share of any contri-&#13;
butions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
The net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense allocated to the Corporation is included in income from (contributions to) Staff&#13;
Retirement Plan and cost of (income from) other postretirement benefits, respectively, in the income statement. The Corporation includes a receivable from&#13;
IBRD in receivables and other assets, representing prepaid pension and other postretirement benefit costs.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting and financial reporting developments - During the year ended June 30, 2002 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued several&#13;
new accounting standards, including SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations, SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, SFAS No. 143 Accounting&#13;
for Asset Retirement Obligations, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB&#13;
Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. None of these accounting standards are expected to have&#13;
a material impact on the Corporation's financial position or results of operations.&#13;

NOTE I ­ CAPITAL STOCK&#13;
The Corporation's authorized share capital was increased to $2,450 million through two capital increases in 1992. The subscription and payment period for shares&#13;
then allocated ended on August 1, 1999, but the Corporation has agreed to defer the payment date for certain member countries beyond this date. Pursuant to&#13;
these arrangements, $2 million of subscribed shares remained unpaid at June 30, 2002 ($14 million - June 30, 2001).&#13;
&#13;
During the year ended June 30, 2002, 92 shares were subscribed by member countries at a par value of $1,000 each (624 - year ended June 30, 2001). Less than&#13;
1 million was paid in on account of subscriptions (less than $1 million - year ended June 30, 2001).&#13;

Of the total other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments, unrealized gains of $72 million (gains $22 million - year ended June 30, 2001) are attributable&#13;
to borrowings and related derivatives transactions, unrealized losses of $19 million (losses $7 million - year ended 30 June, 2001) are attributable to loans and related&#13;
derivatives transactions, and unrealized gains of $1 million (losses $4 million - year ended 30 June, 2001) are attributable to client risk management activities.&#13;
&#13;
At the date of initial application of SFAS No. 133 on July 1, 2000, certain items were recorded as a transition adjustment, denoted as the cumulative effect of a&#13;
change in accounting principle in the income statement. The transition adjustment included, first, the difference between the previous carrying value and the fair value&#13;
of all freestanding derivative instruments. Secondly, it included the offsetting gains and losses on assets and liabilities held under fair value-like hedging relationships&#13;
in existence prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133 that are also recognized by adjusting their carrying value to fair value. Finally, the adjustment included the fair&#13;
value of derivatives embedded in hybrid financial instruments entered into on or after January 1, 1999, where they are required to be separated from their respec-&#13;
tive host contracts, and also recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The total amount of the transition adjustment, recorded on July 1, 2000, was $93 million.&#13;
&#13;
Also upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, the Corporation recorded a gain of $14 million to accumulated other comprehensive income to adjust the book value to fair&#13;
value of cross-currency interest rate swaps in cash flow-like hedges. The Corporation elected not to seek hedge accounting for these transactions under the&#13;
Standard and, accordingly, records the cross-currency interest rate swaps at fair value, with the change in fair value included in earnings. The gain recorded in&#13;
accumulated other comprehensive income upon adoption of the Standard is released into earnings over the remaining original hedge term. The amounts released&#13;
for the years ended June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2001 are shown above; the expected release for the year ending June 30, 2003 is $2 million.&#13;

&#13;
NOTE M ­ DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
Many of the Corporation's financial instruments are not actively traded in any market. Accordingly, estimates and present value calculations of future cash flows are&#13;
used to estimate the fair values. Determining future cash flows for fair value estimation is subjective and imprecise, and minor changes in assumptions or method-&#13;
ologies may materially affect the estimated values. The excess or deficit resulting from the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair values presented&#13;
does not necessarily reflect the realizable values, since the Corporation generally holds loans, borrowings, and other financial instruments to maturity with the aim&#13;
of realizing their recorded values.&#13;
&#13;
The estimated fair values reflect the interest rate environments as of June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2001. In different interest rate environments, the fair value of the&#13;
Corporation's financial assets and liabilities could differ significantly, especially the fair value of certain fixed rate financial instruments. Reasonable comparability of fair&#13;
values among financial institutions is not likely, because of the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates that must be made in the absence&#13;
of secondary market prices. This lack of objective pricing standards introduces a greater degree of subjectivity and volatility to these derived or estimated fair values.&#13;
Therefore, while disclosure of estimated fair values of financial instruments is required, readers are cautioned in using these data for purposes of evaluating the finan-&#13;
cial condition of the Corporation. The fair values of the individual financial instruments do not represent the fair value of the Corporation taken as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 36&#13;
&amp;#12;The methodologies used and key assumptions made to estimate fair values as of June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2001 are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid assets - The estimated fair value of time deposits and the trading securities portfolio are based on quoted market prices and the present value of estimated&#13;
future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
Derivative instruments - Fair values for covered forwards were derived by using quoted market forward exchange rates. Fair values for other derivative instruments&#13;
were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
Loans and loan commitments - The Corporation generally has not sold its loans from the portfolio, and there is no comparable secondary market. Fair values for&#13;
fixed rate loans and loan commitments were determined using a discounted cash flow model based on a discount rate comprising the fixed rate loan spread plus&#13;
the year-end estimated cost of funds. Since rates on variable rate loans and loan commitments are generally reset on a quarterly or semiannual basis, the carrying&#13;
value adjusted for credit risk was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. The Corporation also holds options to convert loans into equity of certain of its&#13;
investee companies. Fair values of these conversion options are based on quoted market prices or other calculated values of the underlying equity investment.&#13;
&#13;
Equity investments - Fair values were determined using market prices where available, put option prices, book values, or cost, certain of which were discounted&#13;
based upon management's estimate of net realizable value. Where market prices were not available or alternate valuation techniques were not practical, cost was&#13;
determined to be the best estimate of fair value. Management's estimate of fair value takes into consideration the relative illiquidity and volatility, as well as the overall&#13;
business constraints, in the emerging markets in which the Corporation invests.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings - Fair values were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
Estimated fair values of the Corporation's financial assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are summarized below (US$ millions).&#13;
The Corporation's credit exposure is represented by the estimated fair values of its financial assets.&#13;

NOTE O ­ SEGMENT REPORTING&#13;
For management purposes, the Corporation's business comprises two segments: client services and treasury services. The client services segment consists&#13;
primarily of lending and equity investment activities. The treasury services segment consists of the borrowing, liquid asset management, asset and liability manage-&#13;
ment, and client risk management activities.&#13;
&#13;
The assessment of segment performance by senior management includes net income for each segment, return on assets, and return on capital employed. The&#13;
Corporation's management reporting system and policies are used to determine revenues and expenses attributable to each segment. Consistent with internal&#13;
reporting, administrative expenses are allocated to each segment based largely upon personnel costs and segment head counts. Transactions between segments&#13;
are immaterial and, thus, are not a factor in reconciling to the consolidated data.&#13;
&#13;
The accounting policies of the Corporation's segments are, in all material respects, consistent with those described in note A, Summary of Significant Accounting&#13;
and Related Policies.&#13;
&#13;
An analysis of the Corporation's major components of income and expense by business segment for the years ended June 30, 2002, 2001, and 2000 is given below&#13;

During the year ended June 30, 2002, the Corporation changed its method of allocating certain costs among business units within the Corporation. Segment disclo-&#13;
sures for the years ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000 have been restated to be consistent with the new allocation method. Geographical segment data in respect&#13;
of client services are disclosed in note C, and are not relevant in respect of treasury services.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                        39&#13;
&amp;#12;NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued&#13;
&#13;
NOTE P ­ PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS&#13;
IBRD has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP), and a Post-Employment Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substan-&#13;
tially all of its staff members as well as the staff of the Corporation and of MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees.&#13;
The PEBP provides pension benefits administered outside the SRP. All costs associated with these plans are allocated between IBRD, the Corporation, and MIGA&#13;
based upon their employees' respective participation in the plans. In addition, the Corporation and MIGA reimburse IBRD for their share of any contributions made&#13;
to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
Net income from the SRP allocated to the Corporation for the year ended June 30, 2002 was $36 million ($50 million - year ended June 30, 2001; $47 million - year&#13;
ended June 30, 2000). The portion of the cost for the RSBP and the PEBP attributable to the Corporation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 was $5 million&#13;
($3 million - year ended June 30, 2001; $2 million - year ended June 30, 2000).&#13;
&#13;
In addition, at June 30, 2002, $286 million was receivable by the Corporation from IBRD ($250 million - June 30, 2001), representing the accumulated excess of its&#13;
contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit assets over its allocated net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE Q ­ SERVICE AND SUPPORT PAYMENTS&#13;
The Corporation obtains certain administrative and overhead services from IBRD in those areas where common services can be efficiently provided by IBRD. This&#13;
includes shared costs of the Boards of Governors and Directors, and other services such as communications, internal auditing, administrative support, supplies,&#13;
and insurance. Payments for these services are made by the Corporation to IBRD based on negotiated fees, chargebacks, and allocated charges, where&#13;
chargeback is not feasible. Expenses allocated to the Corporation for the year ended June 30, 2002, were $19 million ($19 million - year ended June 30, 2001;&#13;
$16 million - year ended June 30, 2000).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE R ­ REORGANIZATION COSTS&#13;
On March 8, 2002 the Corporation adopted a Strategic Directions Paper articulating its strategic priorities, being: frontier markets; high impact sectors; and&#13;
support for small to medium enterprises. To achieve these strategic priorities, in late March the Corporation began a major internal reorganization planning exercise&#13;
designed to sharpen the focus on the needs of the Corporation's clients, strengthen developmental impact, increase the volume of high quality assets, and provide&#13;
counter cyclical support in countries affected by volatility in capital flows. Details and particulars of the reorganization plan were finalized and announced during the&#13;
quarter ended June 30, 2002. The plan involves staff reductions, field office closings and reorganizations, and a headquarters reorganization which the Corporation&#13;
estimates will commence and conclude during the year ending June 30, 2003.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has accrued $13 million associated with the reorganization, included in administrative expenses in the income statement for the year ended June&#13;
30, 2002. The accrual primarily represents costs associated with termination benefits (including outplacement consulting, job search assistance, training, medical&#13;
insurance plan contributions, severance payments, and related tax allowances) for 115 staff identified for separation as of June 30, 2002. An additional amount, less&#13;
than $1 million, is associated with various field office closures and reorganizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE S ­ TRUST FUNDS&#13;
The Corporation uses the services of IBRD to administer funds on behalf of donors which are restricted for specific uses, including technical assistance, feasibility&#13;
studies and project preparation, global and regional programs, and research and training programs. These funds are placed in trust and are not included in the&#13;
Corporation's assets. The responsibilities of the Corporation are to arrange for services generally not otherwise provided by it, including full project implementation&#13;
and procurement of goods and services. The distribution of Trust Fund assets by executing agent is as follows (US$ millions):&#13;

NOTE T ­ CONTINGENCIES&#13;
In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is from time to time named as a defendant or co-defendant in various legal actions on different grounds in&#13;
various jurisdictions. In March 2002 the Corporation, two of its staff members, and certain other parties were named as defendants in a lawsuit in Indonesia involving&#13;
a local company in which the Corporation has a minority equity stake. The lawsuit was withdrawn in July 2002.&#13;

                   IFC's strategic priorities focus on frontier markets, on high-impact&#13;
                   sectors such as domestic financial markets and infrastructure, and on&#13;
                   support for small and medium enterprises and sustainable develop-&#13;
                   ment. Sustainability is a key strategic priority and provides an increas-&#13;
                   ingly important vehicle for IFC to add value to our clients in the private&#13;
                   sector and complement member countries' development efforts. IFC's&#13;
                   ability to help firms manage environmental, social, and governance&#13;
                   risks and opportunities differentiates IFC from other lenders. The&#13;
                   Corporation's expertise in these areas, in particular, enables it to take&#13;
                   on and add value to large, complex projects that others may avoid.&#13;

This review is the first of its kind prepared for public release by IFC. Some information appearing in this report&#13;
has no comparable information for previous periods. Modifications of management reporting systems under-&#13;
way will allow for more efficient collation of data, and this may be reflected in future reporting. Unless other-&#13;
wise noted, annual data refer to our July-June fiscal year (for example, FY02 began on July 1, 2001, and ended&#13;
on June 30, 2002). All currency data are provided in U.S. dollars throughout, unless otherwise specified.&#13;
  This report focuses primarily on IFC's core business impacts or those related to investment and advisory&#13;
activities. IFC staff appreciate the advice of staff from the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies&#13;

IFC PROFILE&#13;
The International Finance Corporation is an international organization established in 1956 to further economic&#13;
growth in its developing member countries by promoting sustainable private sector investment. IFC is a mem-&#13;
ber of the World Bank Group, which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
(IBRD, or the World Bank), the International Development Association (IDA), and the Multilateral Investment&#13;
Guarantee Agency (MIGA). IFC is a legal entity separate and distinct from the World Bank, IDA, and MIGA,&#13;
with its own Articles of Agreement, share capital, financial structure, management, and staff. Membership in&#13;
IFC is open only to member countries of the World Bank. As of June 30, 2002, IFC's entire share capital&#13;
was held by 175 member countries.&#13;
  IFC invests on a commercial basis but, as a public entity, does so where markets are not fully developed,&#13;
complementing and catalyzing funding from private financial markets rather than competing with them.&#13;
  IFC's principal products are loans, equity and quasi-equity investments, guarantees, and risk management&#13;
products. IFC is the largest multilateral source of loan and equity financing for the private sector in emerging&#13;
economies. We also mobilize significant resources through loan participations and securities offerings. In addi-&#13;
tion, we provide advisory services and technical assistance for our clients. Unlike most multilateral develop-&#13;
ment institutions, IFC does not accept host government guarantees. IFC raises virtually all of the funds for&#13;
its lending activities through the issuance of debt obligations in international capital markets. Equity invest-&#13;
ments are funded from net worth.&#13;
  The World Bank Group is increasingly focused on supporting sustainable private sector development.&#13;
As its private sector arm, IFC has an important role to play in the development of an environment that enables&#13;
private sector development in concert with the efforts of IBRD, IDA, and MIGA. Instruments to leverage exper-&#13;
tise across the World Bank Group include strategic cooperation at the corporate level, at the country and sec-&#13;
tor level, and through joint Bank-IFC organizational structures in the Global Product Groups (small and medium&#13;
enterprises, advisory services, communications and information technology, and oil, gas, and mining).&#13;

                      Environmental        All proposed IFC-financed projects require an environmental assessment to ensure that&#13;

                                           of each of these categories are given in the environmental and social review procedure.&#13;
                                           IFC's information disclosure policy sets forth the minimum requirements for public con-&#13;

                      Natural habitats     IFC promotes and supports natural habitat conservation and improved land use and the&#13;
                                           protection, maintenance, and rehabilitation of natural habitats and their functions. IFC&#13;
                                           does not support projects that involve significant conversion or degradation of critical&#13;

                      Pest management      IFC supports the use of biological or environmental control methods rather than the use&#13;
                                           of pesticides where there is a need for pest management. Where pesticides are required,&#13;
                                           this policy sets forth the criteria for their use.&#13;

                                           existing dams, including tailings dams, the owner of a dam has full responsibility for the&#13;
                                           safety of the dam. IFC requires that dams be designed and constructed by experienced&#13;
                                           and competent professionals. For large dams (over 15 meters high) and dams between&#13;
                                           10 and 15 meters that present special design complexities, IFC requires reviews by a&#13;

Forced labor        IFC will not support projects that use forced labor and harmful child labor. "Forced&#13;
and harmful         labor" consists of all work or service not voluntarily performed that is exacted from an&#13;
child labor         individual under threat of force or penalty. "Harmful child labor" consists of the employ-&#13;
                    ment of children that is economically exploitative or is likely to be hazardous to, or to inter-&#13;
                    fere with, the child's education or to be harmful to the child's health or to its physical,&#13;

Indigenous          IFC projects must comply with World Bank­related policy in a private sector context.&#13;
peoples             Indigenous people are identified by qualified social development specialists and normally&#13;
                    have the following characteristics: close attachment to ancestral territories and natural&#13;
                    resources; self-identification and identification by others as members of a distinct cultural&#13;
                    group; an indigenous language, often different from the national language; primarily&#13;
                    subsistence-oriented production; and the presence of customary social and political insti-&#13;
                    tutions. The policy requires the preparation of an indigenous people's action plan.&#13;

cultural property   tural property, consistent with World Bank policy on cultural property, in a private sector&#13;
                    context. "Cultural property" includes sites having archaeological (prehistoric), paleonto-&#13;
                    logical, historical, religious, and unique natural values (such as burial grounds, temples,&#13;
                    churches, mosques, monuments, shrines, and artifacts). "Cultural property" also encom-&#13;
                    passes unique natural environmental features such as canyons and waterfalls.&#13;
&#13;
Involuntary         The objective of the resettlement policy is to ensure that the population displaced by a&#13;
resettlement        project receives benefits from it. This policy applies wherever land, housing, or other&#13;
                    resources are taken involuntarily from people. Involuntary resettlement should be avoided&#13;
                    or minimized where feasible, exploring all viable alternative project designs. The policy&#13;
                    sets out the objectives to be met and procedures to be followed for carrying out base-&#13;
                    line studies, impact analyses, and mitigation plans when affected people must move or&#13;
                    lose part or all of their livelihoods. It also provides an outline for a resettlement plan.&#13;

&amp;#12;                      MEASURING GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACT&#13;
&#13;
                      In line with its commitment to transparency in its operations, IFC prepares an environmental impact assessment&#13;
                      or an environmental review summary (both disclosed at the World Bank Infoshop) for every project in which it con-&#13;
                      siders investing. Included in that disclosure is a description of potential air emissions and how they will be&#13;
                      addressed to ensure compliance with applicable host country laws and regulations and with World Bank and IFC&#13;
                      requirements. If a project under consideration is likely to produce more than 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide equiv-&#13;
                      alents per year, IFC estimates the greenhouse gas emissions in its appraisal of the project. IFC is working toward&#13;
                      reporting annually on the GHG emissions of all its investments in major GHG-intensive activities.&#13;
                           The vast majority of projects in which IFC invested in FY 2002 had GHG emissions substantially less than&#13;
                      100,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year. In any case, IFC works with project sponsors to explore oppor-&#13;
                      tunities to reduce such emissions if there is potential to reduce them significantly by modifying the project design.&#13;
                      For example, IFC has made an investment in the modernization of three electricity distribution companies in&#13;
                      Moldova. When completed in 2005, the project is expected to reduce GHG emissions by 30,000 tons of carbon&#13;
                      dioxide per year.&#13;

&amp;#12;                       SUPPORTING SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
&#13;
                       This year IFC helped establish a process to develop a model for project reporting that conforms to the Global&#13;
                       Reporting Initiative's sustainability guidelines. The pilot program, funded by IFC's Technical Assistance Trust&#13;
                       Funds program, focuses on IFC client companies from Europe. IFC hopes to gather information on the ben-&#13;
                       efits and barriers to sustainability reporting in developing countries and to foster a stakeholder engagement&#13;
                       model for reporting that reinforces IFC's strong commitment to developing community-business partnerships.&#13;
                          IFC is collaborating closely with the GRI and the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at the&#13;
                       Central European University (CEU) in Budapest. Participating companies have begun mainstreaming sus-&#13;

                       assessed at a workshop later this year, and the first sustainability report is expected in spring 2003. One&#13;
                       pilot company has also agreed to have its report verified, and CSR network (U.K.) has been engaged to&#13;
                       undertake this assignment.&#13;
                          IFC will also explore ways to expand the pilot program to other geographic regions. IFC recently estab-&#13;
                       lished the Corporate Citizenship Facility, which will consider supporting future pilot projects. This facility is&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2002 : investing in a sustainable private sector
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report concerns the operations of
            the International Finance Corporation (IFC) during fiscal
            year 2002. The year began with economic uncertainty in many
            parts of the world. The scale and magnitude of the events of
            September 11 affected business. By mid-year the global
            economic uncertainty, and especially exposure to Argentina,
            left IFC vulnerable to its first-ever annual loss. Despite
            substantial new provisioning, the IFC was able to show a
            $161 million operating profit for the year, committing $3.1
            billion in financing to 204 projects for IFC's own
            account, a 14 percent increase over the previous year. About
            two-thirds of the IFC's new investments were in
            financial markets, infrastructure, information technology,
            and health and education. Lending to small and medium
            enterprises directly and through intermediaries amounted to
            about $540 million, or 17 percent of new financing for
            IFC's account. First volume of the report contents: IFC
            Boards of Directors; message from the Executive Vice
            President; investing in a sustainable private sector;
            spotlights on clients; product and services; operations and
            regional reports; annual review; FY 2002 projects; and
            appendixes. Second volume of the report contents:
            managements discussion and analysis; responsibility for
            external financial reporting; financial statements; and
            investment portfolio.
