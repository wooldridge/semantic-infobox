 Interviewee: Mr. Robert H. Nooter&#13;
&#13;
 Interviewer: Mr. Robert E. Asher, Consultant&#13;
 Date and Place of Interview: September 23, 1982&#13;
                              Bank Headquarters&#13;
                              washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
 Asher: Today is September 23rd. My name is Robert Asher. I have with me Mr.&#13;
 Robert H. Neater who was Resident Representative of the world Bank in Tanzania&#13;
 from 1980 to 1982 and is now senior loan officer for the Sudan here at the&#13;
 Bank's Headquarters in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
     Bob, would you reminisce for a few moments on the nature of the job you&#13;
 had in Tanzania, how it was described to you when you were being recruited for&#13;
 the post, how it actually evolved in practice, how the post of Resident&#13;
 Representative fitted into the Bank's chain of command and so on?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter - All right, Bob. First, I served in that post from about the 1st. of&#13;
March 1980 to the end of April 1982. When I had discussions with the Bank&#13;
people, before I joined the Bank in 1979, the job was described as the&#13;
Resident Representative for the World Bank in the country in question, in this&#13;
case Tanzania, and consisting of two principal parts: on the one hand, acting&#13;
as a general facilitator of the Bank's programme in terms of assisting the&#13;
Bank's supervision missions and Bank personnel travelling to Tanzania in their&#13;
work of carrying out projects, carrying out the preparation of future projects&#13;
and so on; on the other side, and more interesting to me, was the policy&#13;
dialogue which the Bank has on a more or less continual basis with the&#13;
countries it has a relationship with. In this case, the Resident&#13;
Representative being in the country all the time, filled the function of&#13;
carrying forward that policy dialogue with the officials of the government of&#13;
the country. I would say that in fact it worked out about that way - that is,&#13;
those were the two principal parts of the job.&#13;
&#13;
       I had no illusions about the first part of that in the sense of it&#13;
  involving a great deal of routine, passing of information, following up on&#13;
  detail and so on, and that was quite clear in the discussions ahead of time&#13;
  and in fact it does encompass a fair amount of a Resident Representative's&#13;
. work, that is, the leg work associated with carrying out the programme and in&#13;
  fact consumes a fairly large amount of the time in the office. some part of&#13;
  that is carried out by local staff, some part in this case by the Deputy&#13;
  Representative. The policy dialogue, which is the most important part, is&#13;
  also perhaps the least time consuming of the two pieces by a long measure.&#13;
  This might mean 5 percent on policy and 95 percent on the other side. Now the&#13;
  routine part goes a little further than that. The Resident Representative is&#13;
  entitled to express certain opinions and views about internal Bank work. For&#13;
  example as the country strategy is being developed, the Resident&#13;
  Representative may comment on the drafts that are being prepared, express&#13;
  views on project preparation work that is going&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     -2-&#13;
&#13;
forward and so on, which is substantive work. One limitation of that is that&#13;
the field location and the slowness of the mail make it difficult to&#13;
participate in that internal Bank dialogue as effectively as if one is located&#13;
in Washington so that is just a practical limitation of that aspect of the&#13;
work.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Well, can you tell me a little bit more about with whom in Tanzania you&#13;
would deal? I assume in the case of at least the senior officials you went to&#13;
their offices, but who came to your office, what was the division of work&#13;
between you, and you mentioned you had a deputy, and your deputy?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: Yes, the office in Tanzania consisted of two regular Bank staff,&#13;
myself and the deputy and then 4 or 5 local employees doing secretarial,&#13;
clerical, administrative and messenger work and that sort of thing. Well, my&#13;
regular contacts in the government were at the ministerial and principal&#13;
secretary level. The Minister of Finance, the Minister of Economic Planning&#13;
and their principal secretaries were our most regular points of contact in&#13;
regard to policy questions or important implementation issues. But I a~so&#13;
dealt with the head of the Central Bank and a number of the other ministers,&#13;
that is those ministries where we had Bank programs, particularly agriculture,&#13;
industry, transportation and that sort of thing.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: What about other U.N. family personnel? Was there a Fund Resident&#13;
Representative and, if so, did he have an office near yours?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: The IMF does not have a resident office in Tanzania but many of the&#13;
other aid organizations are well represented there. Tanzania is a large aid&#13;
recipient and the bilateral developed-country programs are well represented,&#13;
as well as the EEC, the UNDP and several of the other specialised agencies of&#13;
the UN. So there is a large foreign community. One other aspect of my job&#13;
was to stay in touch with those representatives, to coordinate, if you will,&#13;
our programs, to be sure that each of us knew what the other was doing and so&#13;
on. One of the things we started while I was there was an informal, once a&#13;
month meeting with the heads of the various aid agencies there to exchange&#13;
information and to talk about important topics.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Was there or wasn't there a formally established consultative group for&#13;
Tanzania to coordinate the work of the donors?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: There was no formal group as such. There have been from time to time&#13;
consultative group meetings, usually I guess in Paris. The last one might&#13;
have been 4 years ago or so, although it preceded my time by a fair amount.&#13;
The entire time I was there included discussions with the government about&#13;
holding another consultative group meeting but it never took place.&#13;
&#13;
Asher : Was this because the government really wasn't that keen on it?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Neater: I always thought there was some reluctance on the part of the&#13;
government to have it, although at various times they did agree to have one.&#13;
But the most conducive time to have a consultative group meeting is when there&#13;
is good agreement between the country and the Bank and preferably the IMF, in&#13;
which we can all be supportive of the policies going forward. That policy mix&#13;
never really quite came to an appropriate head. I would say this was more a&#13;
reason than anything else for continuing to postpone the meeting as our&#13;
various policy discussions went on. But we did have this informal once a&#13;
month group that met not with government representation but just among the&#13;
donors themselves, although we had sought government approval to hold those&#13;
meetings because we didn't want do it without their being aware of what was&#13;
going on.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Who chaired those?&#13;
&#13;
Neater: The UNDP Rep and I alternated chairing those meetings.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Well, you implied that there was a number of donor countries and donor&#13;
agencies involved in Tanzania. In comparative financial terms how important&#13;
was the Bank, IDA and IFC in that country during the years you were there?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: The Bank - I use that term interchangeably with IDA because in fact&#13;
all of our lending to Tanzania in recent years has been with IDA funds rather&#13;
than Bank funds - was the biggest single donor to the country, but only by a&#13;
narrow margin. I believe Sweden was the next largest. we put in about 15% of&#13;
the annual aid commitments. The level varies of course but it was something&#13;
over a hundred million, maybe a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty&#13;
million dollars in some years. sweden put in about 90 to 95 million and so on&#13;
down the line. Our contribution was about 15% of the total, but being the&#13;
largest single contributor, we did have somewhat of a special place in terms&#13;
of the relationship. We certainly had access to Tanzanian officials and were&#13;
in a position to discuss issues and policies with them.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: The Bank's literature stresses and attaches a great importance to the&#13;
policy dialogue between the Bank and the borrowing government and you said&#13;
this was outlined to you as one important part of your job. But in a&#13;
one-party, Marxist-oriented country such as Tanzania, is this a dialogue of&#13;
the deaf? How acceptable is the kind of advice on subsidies and pricing&#13;
policies and exchange rates and government ownership and so on offered by the&#13;
Bank and, in the case of exchange rates, the Fund, especially if the advice&#13;
comes via a product of us industry and the us Foreign Aid Program such as&#13;
yourself?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: Let me try to describe that a little bit. Certainly there was a&#13;
dialogue but there were also some limitations on it. But to go back to your&#13;
question, I would tend to call Tanzania a firmly socialist country, committed,&#13;
but not necessarily a Marxist economy. I'm not sure exactly how to define the&#13;
difference between those two except that I would say the rhetoric of the&#13;
government was more socialist than Marxist, if I can identify Marxist rhetoric&#13;
when I hear it. Having said that, I would say that the country is quite&#13;
commmitted to its own policy approach to problems. It is also a country that&#13;
feels very strongly about its own sovereignty and about its right to make its&#13;
own decisions. It's a bit sensitive about foreign intrusions from whatever&#13;
source and to that extent while certainly not only the World Bank but the&#13;
other aid donors had ready access to government officials, nevertheless at the&#13;
policy level the President had made clear, in fact made one rather well&#13;
publicised speech during the time I was there, that government officials&#13;
should not be unduly influenced by outside sources and they should be making&#13;
their own decisions, coming to their own conclusions and if that were not the&#13;
case, they really were not carrying out their own responsibilities as good&#13;
party members and government servants. So, to that extent, the Tanzanian&#13;
policy makers were a bit on guard against accepting foreign advice. Now r&#13;
don't mean to overemphasize that, but it was a factor.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Do you think you could have an impact or the Bank does have an impact?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: r would say that the policy changes that have taken place in recent&#13;
years have been absolutely minimal. The President has stuck very much to his&#13;
own perception of how the economy should work and how the society should work,&#13;
in spite of the economic reverses in recent years, so to that extent I would&#13;
say that the track record is not particularly impressive about policy changes&#13;
in Tanzania. It doesn't mean that they don't change from time to time. In&#13;
some directions we would think they made things worse, in others, the changes&#13;
they made may hold promise of making things better; but in fact the Tanzanians&#13;
take pride in saying that they are prepared to change anything they've done&#13;
that didn't work in the past. They point, for example, to the elimination of&#13;
cooperatives which took place in about 1975. During this past year they've&#13;
decided to reestablish them. However, I still would say that the changes of a&#13;
nature that might tend to correct the economic problems have been minimal and&#13;
to that extent Tanzania would not be a particularly good case to point to&#13;
where we have had what r would call a successful policy dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Could we focus for a moment on a specific, though perhaps not a&#13;
typical, IDA project in Tanzania, the kind that is supposed to facilitate&#13;
macroeconomic policy changes, that is the 50 million dollar structural&#13;
adjustment loan that was approved in 1981? How long was it in the pipeline?&#13;
What was it supposed to accomplish? What happened? Why?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Neater: That is sort of a long story, but it started really in about January&#13;
of 1980 just before I came out to Tanzania. The Bank President, Mr. McNamara,&#13;
made a visit to Tanzania, his first in, I think, about 9 years. Out of his&#13;
discussion with President Nyerere came the notion that the Bank was prepared&#13;
to entertain a structural adjustment loan if the policy conditions could be&#13;
worked out. The process of discussing and considering structural adjustment&#13;
went on the entire time I was there. It led to two different Bank missions,&#13;
the first in March and the second in about June of 1980, to try to see if&#13;
there was a basis for a structural adjustment loan, whether the Tanzanian&#13;
program to justify program-type lending would be adequate to do so, and both&#13;
of those missions were unsuccessful. A third mission came out in November and&#13;
worked out a set of conditions that was thought to be adequate to support an&#13;
interim structural adjustment loan. The Tanzanians, by and large, agreed with&#13;
those conditions a couple of months later and a loan went forward in about&#13;
April 1981. This was a partial structural adjustment loan and that was the&#13;
loan you referred to.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: By partial, do you mean focused on a sector or part of the total funds?&#13;
&#13;
Neater~ It was mainly directed toward agriculture, but partial in this sense&#13;
meant that the policy conditions were not thought of as ones which would turn&#13;
around the entire economy, but ones which would move it somewhat in the proper&#13;
direction. A condition of that loan, if you will, and the understanding of&#13;
that loan, was that the policy dialogue would continue and, in this case, the&#13;
Bank offered to finance some outside experts to come in and make another try&#13;
at a structural adjustment program for Tanzania. So this was thought of as a&#13;
step in giving Tanzania some financial relief, making some partial policy&#13;
adjustments (including removal of export taxes on agricultural exports and&#13;
increased agricultural prices to farmers), which would be followed by a group&#13;
of outside experts who would come in and work with the Tanzanians. Well, that&#13;
was the fourth attempt then at structural adjustment in the form of three so&#13;
called wise men, whose identities or selection, if you will, were mutually&#13;
agreed upon by the Government and the Bank, who with their working staff then&#13;
spent the next 8 months working out a program for Tanzanian consideration.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: In Tanzania?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter~ In Tanzania. And these were people who did not report to the Bank.&#13;
In fact, we went out of our way to maintain only minimal contact with them.&#13;
We did maintain some contact, but we did not attempt in any way to appear to&#13;
be influencing their decisions or putting forward Bank views on what those&#13;
policy changes should be. That work was completed in about March of 1982 and&#13;
the government reviewed it and accepted some portion of it, which it then sent&#13;
forward to the Bank for its consideration. Then I left in April and I've lost&#13;
track a bit of that dialogue, but my understanding is that the discussion is&#13;
still going on and our fifth mission, in this case Bank staff people, is going&#13;
out this coming month to make another review of the structural adjustment&#13;
situation.&#13;
&amp;#12;Asher: Am I correct, there haven't then been disbursements yet under this&#13;
program?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: No, the so called interim program was consummated, was disbursed and&#13;
was implemented, but we still have not achieved what the Bank would consider&#13;
as a full structural adjustment program with Tanzania and that was the basis&#13;
for my having said earlier that I don't think we really had achieved as yet,&#13;
we haven't consummated at least, a successful policy dialogue with Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: But of a more specific nature, there have been successful projects in&#13;
Tanzania that might shed light on the factors that make for success as&#13;
compared to those that may lead to failure. What in your view does the Bank&#13;
do best in a country like that? What, in addition to this kind of structural&#13;
adjustment lending, does it have the most difficulty doing?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: Mr. Clausen paid a visit out there in November when he made his first&#13;
field visit with the Bank to Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Asher: This was November, 1980 or 1981?&#13;
&#13;
Neater: This was November, 1981. He asked what was the best project there and&#13;
I said that I thought our best, most successful project was a series of power&#13;
projects, a hydroelectric power development, for a number of reasons. It was&#13;
techically sound. It produced a definite commodity of which the country was&#13;
in great need. It saved foreign exchange by reducing their dependence on&#13;
imported oil; also the organization which ran the hydroelectric system was one&#13;
of the stronger so called parastatals in Tanzania and the Bank also had done a&#13;
good job in helping build up and strengthen that organization. So on all&#13;
those counts, I think that was definitely a successful Bank project.&#13;
&#13;
    But we were having and are still having a lot of difficulty with a number&#13;
of our other projects there. I would say on the whole, the Bank has most&#13;
regular success with infrastructure type projects such as hydroelectric power&#13;
where the investments are fairly large in size, they can be designed and&#13;
supervised and managed fairly well. When you get into some of the&#13;
agricultural sectors where there are very complex policy issues and&#13;
institutional issues, as well as complicated technical issues, it is a much&#13;
more difficult task and one in which we, as every agency, is more apt to stub&#13;
its toe.&#13;
&#13;
    The Bank operates mainly out of washington, in spite of our small field&#13;
office there, because we were not really set up to supervise the project&#13;
implementation, we didn't have the staff or the capacity to do that. But with&#13;
the Washington-based operation, the Bank isn't able to keep a daily eye on&#13;
projects of that kind, that is where there are constant implementation&#13;
problems arising; problems having to do with institution-building and training&#13;
and also just daily operations of things like research stations and extension&#13;
services. Now the Bank doesn't set itself up to do that kind of job and I am&#13;
not saying that it should, but it does represent a limitation on the Bank's&#13;
ability to be successful in an area that is terribly complex and requires very&#13;
close daily management.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Asher: But the pre-McNamara world Bank was the one that really specialised in&#13;
the infrastructure projects and in the last 10 years or so it has become much&#13;
more interested and focused on trying to do something in the field of&#13;
agriculture and in the more difficult fields that you have mentioned. I take&#13;
it that the Bank is well aware that these are the more difficult areas, but is&#13;
this simply because it has been more or less demonstrated by experience that,&#13;
unless you can do something also in these difficult areas, you somehow cannot&#13;
move the country forward very much? Or what is the explanation?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: I think that is correct. I think the Bank was correct in wanting to&#13;
move into these other areas - they are central or absolutely critical for&#13;
development. It also happens that they are very tough areas in which to work&#13;
and that is particularly true in countries where management is weak, where the&#13;
institutional structures are weak, and so on. Putting that kind of money into&#13;
a country that has a strong institutional base and strong management is one&#13;
thing, but putting it into a country where that doesn't exist is another. I&#13;
would just say this represents a dilemma for the Bank, that is how to be~&#13;
effective in these softer areas which are extremely important but which are&#13;
extremely difficult to manage, and I would say that is a problem the Bank has&#13;
to face during the next number of years.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: The Bank recently produced and published a report on accelerated&#13;
development in sub-Saharan Africa that has been praised and cited, at least in&#13;
the Anglo-Saxon press. That report doesn't make very many specific mentions&#13;
of Tanzania but in your view to what extent is it applicable to that country?&#13;
Who in Tanzania reads that kind of report and would be influenced by it, and&#13;
so on?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: I think the report describes the situation in Tanzania remarkably&#13;
well, that is not in every precise detail but that by and large the problems&#13;
it ascribes to sub-Saharan Africa, the sort of majority or predominant view of&#13;
the development problems, are 95% applicable to Tanzania. In fact, I don't&#13;
know how many other countries it also encompasses so closely but it certainly&#13;
covers the situation there very well. The report was read in Tanzania not&#13;
with great enthusiasm on the part of some people because it's recommending&#13;
solutions which Tanzania has in many cases rejected, that is, free market&#13;
solutions, open economy and that sort of thing, and one Tanzanian at a policy&#13;
level remarked that he didn't think that the report had much applicability for&#13;
Tanzania given its choice of how it wants to run its economy. Although I will&#13;
say that some months after it came out one of the Ministers said that the&#13;
President himself had apparently just read it and said there was a lot of good&#13;
material in it and that the cabinet should study it and see what they can&#13;
learn.&#13;
&#13;
Asher; And there's nobody in the country more important than the President.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Nooter~ That's right, so obviously it must have had some impact there,&#13;
although I didn't hear any more about that. That happened just a couple of&#13;
months before I left and, other than that one Minister having made that&#13;
comment, I didn't hear anymore of what might have evolved out of that&#13;
dialogue. But I do think that by and large the report is an extremely good&#13;
one. It represents some policy choices which countries may not want to make,&#13;
but I will say that it very much lays on the line what the issues are and what&#13;
some of the pitfalls have been and I think it's an excellent report whether or&#13;
not every country decides to accept it - that is that country's choice, of&#13;
course. At least it's a good piece of work.&#13;
&#13;
Asher' Is this kind of report and the world Development Report supposed to be&#13;
part of the Resident Rep's. policy dialogue with officials of the country or&#13;
is it mailed directly to them and, if it comes up in conversation fine; if it&#13;
doesn't you don't have a responsibility as Resident Rep. for bringing it to&#13;
their attention?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: I would say that it is definitely part of the dialogue. we didn't&#13;
have any specific instructions to hold seminars, but obviously a report of&#13;
that kind is a useful piece of information for us to have to work with and we&#13;
did have a number of discussions with the government about it, to the degree&#13;
that they were interested or willing to do so.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Does it get any notice in the local press or in university courses and&#13;
seminars?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: The sub-Sahara Africa   report had not received much local press&#13;
notice. I guess there was an    article or two about it. The World Development&#13;
Report is well reported every   year and of course it's not as specific in terms&#13;
of Africa but it is something   that â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
Asher: But it was very specific this year in terms of agriculture which is&#13;
again one of these difficult sectors.&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: That would have been well reported in the local press. Each year we&#13;
have a little press briefing for the local press on the World Development&#13;
Report.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: "We" being the resident office in various borrowing countries. Not too&#13;
long ago, a few years ago, Tanzania seemed to be the favorite of virtually all&#13;
the world's development agencies. Everybody was praising President Nyerere's&#13;
Ujamaa village program, but I have the impression that since the mid 1970's,&#13;
perhaps for some of the reasons you mentioned, there has been a fall off in&#13;
international enchantment with the Tanzanian program and that aid donors are&#13;
now at a quite different phase of the well known enchantment/disenchantment&#13;
cycle.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     -9-&#13;

Neater: I assume or believe, as I recollect those years, that the basis of the&#13;
enthusiasm for Tanzania in the early 1970's or late 1960's was the egalitarian&#13;
nature of the Nyerere policies; that is, trying to equalize incomes, help the&#13;
poorer segments of society, have a broad-based development that included all&#13;
of the citizens; a little later, their policy of universal primary education&#13;
for example at a time when development people were becoming aware of the need&#13;
for trying to keep from having development accrue too much to a minority,&#13;
these were popular policies. Yes, there has been a disenchantment, I believe,&#13;
in development agencies and among some of the countries that were the most&#13;
supportive, but that hasn't really affected aid flows yet to any extent that&#13;
is apparent. Tanzania is still a large recipient of aid on a per capita&#13;
basis, certainly one of the largest in the world.&#13;
&#13;
     I guess the disenchantment has come for a number of reasons. One, the&#13;
economic record is just not all that good; that is, the problems are very,&#13;
very deep seated. Productive output, particularly of exports, has declined&#13;
over the years and the country's ability to deal with its problems is not very&#13;
good. Second, the actual implementation of the egalitarian policies, as in&#13;
any situation like that, fell short of the objectives. For example, the&#13;
Ujamaa village program led to some forced placement of people in villages.&#13;
That wasn't very popular with some of the people who were most enthusiastic&#13;
about the egalitarian objectives. The universal primary education led to some&#13;
drop in educational standards when trying to put that many additional people&#13;
into school systems in a hurry and so on. so that I would say that the actual&#13;
performance has been somewhat disappointing to people who had the highest&#13;
hopes.&#13;
&#13;
    You described it as a cycle. I would say that is true. That is, maybe&#13;
the original hopes were too high and the disenchantment is and probably will&#13;
be too great. One has to be a bit detached from that kind of cyclical change&#13;
and simply deal with the situation as one finds it, r think. And to the&#13;
extent that Tanzania is willing and able to pursue sensible policies which&#13;
will lead to its development, it should continue to get support. But the&#13;
toughest issue now is, are those conditions going to be such that development&#13;
projects can actually be successful in the country? I would say the present&#13;
set of circumstances is such that it's very difficult to carry out a&#13;
successful project there.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Thank you. Can we return to discuss for a moment your particular long&#13;
experience in the field of development? Back in the early 1960's you took a&#13;
job as a mission director in Liberia for the US Agency for International&#13;
Development and you did not before that, I believe, have experience in&#13;
headquarters. In 1980 you were in a top level job in the USAID program here&#13;
in washington before moving to the World Bank, and you took a job as Resident&#13;
Representative in Tanzania without extensive prior experience at the&#13;
headquarters office of the World Bank. What are the advantages and&#13;
disadvantages of getting shipped out to the field without prior experience in&#13;
the headquarters office?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     -10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: I would say that my experience is the same in both cases, that is, it&#13;
would lead me to the same conclusion. I think it is much preferable to have&#13;
headquarters experience before going out as a field representative in either&#13;
the world Bank or AID. I told the AID people that for many years and I told&#13;
the Bank people that when I came back from Tanzania. It doesn't mean that it&#13;
can't work, but I would just say that when one has been in headquarters and&#13;
understands the operations and the policies and the personalities, it is&#13;
preferable. Some of those things are hard to get out in the field. I found,&#13;
after being with the Bank for 2 1/2 years, coming back to washington in the&#13;
first 3 months I learned more about the project processing system here in&#13;
headquarters than I learned in more than 2 years in the field - that is, how&#13;
it works within the washington headquarters, what are the factors that lead to&#13;
certain decision making, and so on. So that I would simply say it really is&#13;
much preferable for the Bank to send Resident Representatives who have had&#13;
washington experience first.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: My impression is that people at headquarters in the Bank tend to think,&#13;
and with considerable justification, that that's where the action is and that&#13;
being sent out to the field is sort of a genteel form of exile, temporary&#13;
perhaps, but exile. Therefore lateral entry into the upper reaches of the&#13;
Bank here in washington is difficult, but the recruiting people have a lot&#13;
more leeway about whom they can hire and what they can pay for a field job.&#13;
So is one factor simply that for anyone who has had field experience in some&#13;
agency, entering into Bank employment via a field job is the easier way to&#13;
become an employee?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: I think that's probably an accurate description just the way you've&#13;
said it. I wouldn't quarrel with any part of it. On the whole, the Resident&#13;
Representative has very little authority within the Bank to affect the process&#13;
of the Bank and I guess the Bank employees are more aware of that than people&#13;
who come in from outside. Although I will say I was not misled at all on&#13;
those points and I took that job with my eyes open as far as what those&#13;
limitations were. At the same time I will say that a Resident Representative&#13;
has a certain perceived authority by the country in which he is working and by&#13;
the aid community in which he is operating, and so in a sense he has more&#13;
clout, if you will, in the policy dialogue than you would think based on his&#13;
actual authority within the Bank. That is, in the field he is thought of as&#13;
the Bank's representative and to that extent he carries a certain amount of&#13;
authority with him and that does make the policy dialogue more possible than&#13;
would otherwise be the case. I will say though, given the limitations,&#13;
perhaps the Bank in some cases has aimed too high in the level of people it&#13;
puts in the field, given the fact that 95% of the work, or 90%, is not of a&#13;
policy nature. Given the limited authority, it may be that a middle level&#13;
person, obviously a good one who was able to carry on a dialogue, would be&#13;
more appropriate to fill the kind of resident mission we had in Tanzania than&#13;
a high level person.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     -11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Since you also had experience as a mission director for the USAID&#13;
program, would you care to contrast and compare the Resident Rep. job and that&#13;
of mission director as you experienced both of them?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: Well, an AID mission director has a great deal of direct authority.&#13;
He runs an operational program. He manages a technical staff. The projects&#13;
originate in the field and are implemented in the field office. All of those&#13;
are functions which in the Bank are done in Washington so that the roles are&#13;
quite different. I would say that gives AID some advantage on some of these&#13;
operational institutional problems that I referred to before as requiring&#13;
daily attention. I don't necessarily recommend that for the Bank, however. I&#13;
think in a way history is running in the other directionJ that is,&#13;
countries are going to be, have been in recent years, and are going to&#13;
continue to be more the masters of their own fate. They are not going to want&#13;
foreigners running, or appearing to run, parts of their country and therefore&#13;
heavy Bank field involvement wouldn't be appropriate on that ground alone,&#13;
aside from the cost and the administrative difficulty in doing so. Also, once&#13;
you begin to change the authority lines by placing some of that authority in&#13;
the field, you have to be careful that you don't end up with a divided set of&#13;
authorities. I have always believed in the most straight forward, clear cut&#13;
authority designations possible and obviously one always has to compromise&#13;
those in reality. But if one began to move Washington functions to the field,&#13;
one would have to be very careful that you did it in a way that didn't blur&#13;
those authority lines. So I would say that the AID system has certain&#13;
advantages for certain kinds of programs, but I don't think necessarily that&#13;
that's the direction the Bank should go, given this point in time.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Well, now that you are in a headquarters post dealing with Sudan, is&#13;
your relationship with the Bank's Resident Representative in that country&#13;
affected in any significant manner by your whole experience as a Res. Rep.,&#13;
although in a different country, namely in Tanzania?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: I'm sympathetic with his problems and I hope I reflect that in the way&#13;
we provide support to him, but I think the line relationships are what they&#13;
are and I am sure that the Bank's Representative in Sudan has the same&#13;
problems with getting his views expressed, given the slowness of the mails and&#13;
so on, as I did in Tanzania. But that's just a reality, that isn't something&#13;
that we can do anything about, we have to live with those realities. So I&#13;
don't think that it has affected the daily operations to any extent.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: we haven't mentioned the fact that for a good many years the Bank has&#13;
maintained a regional mission in Eastern Africa, in Nairobi to be specific,&#13;
and that it is not a tiny office, it's more than a one or 2 person operation.&#13;
What is the relationship of that office to the Resident Reps in the area?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      -12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: The Nairobi office provided the project backup support, that is&#13;
supervision missions and so on, for agriculture and education projects in&#13;
Tanzania in cases where they had been delegated those authorities by&#13;
Washington. That is to say not all agriculture projects are supervised from&#13;
Nairobi but only some. They also worked on some project preparation where&#13;
that was worked out with washington. our Resident Representative office&#13;
relations with them, I think, were very good. we saw eye to eye on many of&#13;
the problems and issues. They were helpful to us in certain logistical ways.&#13;
we tried to be supportive of them and I think on the whole the relationship&#13;
was a very good one. This I gather was not always the case at the policy&#13;
level. At one time the Resident Mission, I gather, was on a somewhat&#13;
different wave length with Nairobi.&#13;
&#13;
        Organizationally though, I have said here in washington since I have&#13;
come back that the Nairobi arrangement is a bit awkward for some of the&#13;
reasons that I mentioned. The authorities between the washington and Nairobi&#13;
office are somewhat confused, not confused with the Resident office, which has&#13;
the same relationship essentially with Nairobi that it has with washington,&#13;
which is a kind of facilitating role but with no direct authorities, but&#13;
between Nairobi and washington it is a bit confusing. I really wonder whether&#13;
that arrangement, which has a certain historic reason for existing in that&#13;
form, is still relevant. I could imagine that it might be better either&#13;
consolidating that staff back in washington or perhaps experimenting with the&#13;
placing of one or two agriculturalists in a country with a large agricultural&#13;
programme as an extension of the washington staff, rather than an extension of&#13;
the Nairobi staff.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: You said you had a deputy.   was he an agricultural person?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter; No, he had economic training as his background and he was generalist,&#13;
as I was. We shared the same set of duties and we divided the workload of the&#13;
same sorts of things that I described earlier. I would say that relationship&#13;
was a very good one. we carried on the policy dialogue together, sometimes&#13;
with the same people, sometimes with different people. He is an African,&#13;
which I think is some advantage in terms of having rapport and acceptability&#13;
with some parts of that society, and it increased our coverage of the people&#13;
we dealt with and talked with. He happened also to be a very competent, good&#13;
person and it was an excellent relationship. I think it gave us broader&#13;
coverage than either one of us alone would have had.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: But without a clearer set of responsibilities you wouldn't recommend&#13;
necessarily enlarging that kind of office beyond the deputy and the clerical&#13;
personnel that you described?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: No, I think that any enlargement would have to be associated with an&#13;
enlargement of responsibilities. I think that the two of us were well able to&#13;
handle the workload. In fact if the program in Tanzania were smaller, one&#13;
person would be adequate, if the program were larger, more than two would be&#13;
necessary, but with that range of duties I think two was adequate.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     -13-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Asher: I think a number of developing countries consider the Bank a little bit&#13;
hard to deal with, a little slow, a little nosey, a little arrogant, not&#13;
sufficiently sympathetic to the domestic exigencies and, as you said,&#13;
sometimes with a rather different economic philosophy about how to develop.&#13;
Do you think of the Bank as too tough, too soft, about right or what?&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: I have seen the Bank, as represented by its various parts, be all of&#13;
those things at one time or another, but I think that's more a matter of&#13;
individual performance rather than a Bank attitude. I know Mr. Clausen was&#13;
quite aware of some of those issues and commented on them to us when he was in&#13;
Tanzania: the Bank being seen as arrogant on occasions and, as I say, I have&#13;
seen that on the part of individuals who have come through as to the way they&#13;
expressed themselves and so on. But I would say for the most part I think the&#13;
Bank is about right in its outlook, even though its style may need some&#13;
adjusting here and there in the case of individuals. I don't think that it's&#13;
a widespread problem, I don't mean to imply that it is. Toughness and lack of&#13;
toughness I find a badly misunderstood concept.&#13;
&#13;
    I have seen the Bank, if you look over the history of its relations with&#13;
Tanzania, make at least as many or more mistakes by not being what would be&#13;
called tough enough, that is, agreeing to finance a project which the Bank had&#13;
some qualms about because Tanzania wanted to and it did meet the minimum&#13;
standards that the Bank sets, but in retrospect turned out not to be&#13;
successful. 1 don't think that does a country any favor by being what would&#13;
be thought of as sympathetic if it means agreeing to a project which is a load&#13;
on that country's back in the years ahead. So I don't think the Bank can&#13;
afford to be soft in that sense. I think we have to have a set of technically&#13;
sound principles that we operate on. No country has to take Bank funds. We&#13;
should be there and ready to help whenever we think we can do something that&#13;
is helpful, but we do have to hold the line on those things that we think are&#13;
dubious or questionable and that aren't going to be a help in the long run.&#13;
So in that sense I think the Bank on the whole has been very sympathetic to&#13;
what developing countries are trying to achieve and reasonably sympathetic to&#13;
the ways in which they have chosen to go forward. But we can't go farther than&#13;
stick with our pragmatic judgements on what will work and what won't work.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Maybe you've already answered this, but I might elicit a slightly&#13;
different emphasis. Are there, in your view, some lessons for sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa as a whole that ought to be drawn by the Bank from its experience in&#13;
Tanzania and any other countries with which you are familiar?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: I would say that one lesson that Tanzania points up is that aid alone,&#13;
that is money, isn't going to solve sub-Saharan African problems unless it is&#13;
accompanied with other things as well. Tanzania has received a large amount&#13;
of aid over a long period of time and has some very, very fundamental problems&#13;
in spite of that aid. In some cases that aid could even be thought of as at&#13;
least as much a burden as a help, that is some pieces of it, given the kinds&#13;
of plant and equipment or institutional arrangements that it ended up with. I&#13;
think if anything, it would teach us we have to be more rigorous in what will&#13;
work and what won't work.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     -14-&#13;
&#13;
    The world as a whole seems to be sympathetic to sub-Saharan Africa which&#13;
is fortunate and desirable, but the question of how to make available aid&#13;
effective is still one that we are grappling with. The sub-Sahara Africa&#13;
report, I think, says some very useful things about the policy issues involved&#13;
and I have thought for many years in the aid business that the policy issues&#13;
are the overriding issues in aid. Without a good policy mix you really have&#13;
an uphill battle. In addition to that there are management and institutional&#13;
type problems to be dealt in Africa, and many other parts of the world too,&#13;
but particularly Africa, which are slow, slogging jobs that have to be done,&#13;
not by the Bank alone by any means. In many cases the bilateral agencies can&#13;
do those jobs as well or better than the Bank and it will take all of us&#13;
working together.&#13;
&#13;
    So I think we can't be too impatient. We have to have a longer term view&#13;
of the problem than we have had in the past. Yes, it will require resources,&#13;
but those resources have to be made available in a way that's going to end up&#13;
in positive results. To do that we have to be very tough minded in our&#13;
decision making process and try to be sure that the resources that are&#13;
available are put to the best use. Now, those are all generalities at this&#13;
level of discussion. We really have to get it down to the individual cases to&#13;
say what does that mean in this project or that country and I guess maybe that&#13;
is all I can say in general.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Well, is this level of generality a good point on which to wind up our&#13;
session or would you like to make some other concluding comments? Or I can&#13;
open up a new subject if you wish.&#13;
&#13;
Nooter: I think that covers about everything, Bob, that comes to my mind. I do&#13;
think that the Bank and the development community still have a lot to learn&#13;
about development in sub-Saharan Africa. I don't think that the issues are&#13;
well enough understood, that the approach to the solutions of these tremendous&#13;
problems are with us. Every year we know a little more than we did last year,&#13;
but I think that the knowledge gap in the case of a number of these countries&#13;
is still very great. I think we have to work harder on trying to understand&#13;
the problem even while we are trying to solve it. I think we are working very&#13;
hard on implementing things, but we need to work harder on trying to&#13;
understand the nature of the problem and what strategy or what set of tactics&#13;
we need to try to deal with it and not just assume that what we've done in&#13;
Asia or what we've done in other parts of the world are necessarily going to&#13;
be the answer there.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: But I guess you would agree also that the governments of those&#13;
countries have in a sense a lot to learn because they too are still&#13;
experimenting and trying to find keys to development?&#13;
&#13;
Neater: Yes, and we constantly have to remind ourselves - let me again say the&#13;
obvious, but I think that it is important to say from time to time in any of&#13;
these discussions - these countries do belong to the people in those countries&#13;
and we are there to help. But we're not, we can't be, interventionist. we&#13;
can't attempt to run them. we can't dictate to them. we&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     -15-&#13;
&#13;
can try to make available information and funds under conditions that we think&#13;
are apt to work. But they are their countries and they've got to make some of&#13;
their own mistakes. They're entitled to run those countries the way they&#13;
wish. In the case of Mr. Nyerere his principles in many cases are not based&#13;
on necessarily what he thinks will achieve the best economic result, but what&#13;
he believes as a philosophy, and that's his privilege. I mean, after all, he&#13;
is an elected representative of the people of his country. So those are&#13;
limitations we have to accept and work within.&#13;
&#13;
Asher: Well thank you very much, Bob Nooter, for your frank and enlightening&#13;
and I think helpful comments.&#13;

            Robert H. Nooter held on September 23, 1982
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In September 1982, Robert H. Nooter was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert E. Asher. During his tenure at the
            Bank from 1980 to 1988, Mr. Nooter worked in the following
            areas: in Tanzania as a resident representative (1980-1982);
            in the eastern Africa region country programs department as
            a senior loan officer (1982-1986); and in the eastern Africa
            department as senior country program officer (1986-1988). As
            resident representative he acted as a general facilitator of
            the World Bank in terms of supervising personnel travelling
            to Tanzania and also facilitating policy dialogue with the
            client country. His transcript concerns mission work in Africa.
