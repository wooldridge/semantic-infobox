                                            Robert Oliver                                   that wl' go for something about four time&amp; the size of IDA at that time.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            Hl' vas very sympathetic to that.      He vas quite willing to associate&#13;
&#13;
OI.JVER:     Irving, we t&gt;llkf'd yPsterday, for the most part, about thP IDA                himself with that,&#13;
&#13;
R~pl~nishm~nt        during    th~    Woods Administration.         think there are a few   OLIVER:     The four times figure vas more likely yours than his?&#13;
&#13;
points that     ~"    probably did not cover adequately, and l should like to               FRIEDMAN.     In terms of an actual figure, but t think the idea of it&#13;
&#13;
a~k   about them today.           h    it   po~sible   that lloods believed that IDA        being much bigger vas his ovn idea independently.&#13;
&#13;
might become     bi~~er       at some future time than the Bank itself in terma             OLJVF.R:    Well, ve have talked about the vay in which you set about to&#13;
&#13;
of its ability to make loanR?                                                               discover the amount of IDA lending that seemed appropriate, so ve&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDHAN:      It'a hard for me to read his mind, but the one thing                         needn't go through that again.        But maybe you would comment about what&#13;
&#13;
J do know is that, when hP asked me to come over to the Bank originally,                    you perceived as the need for country econamic programs so that&#13;
&#13;
on~   of th" first comments hl' made to mf' vas that he vas asking me to                    statistics and quality evaluations might uncover the relation&#13;
&#13;
come over because in his vipv IDA ought to be bigger than the llorld Bank.                  between Bank lending end IDA lending for a particulsr country ss well&#13;
&#13;
Whether he really thought he could achieve that, I don't know.                    But       as the credit-worthiness problema a country might have.&#13;
&#13;
he was very     cl~arly       of the view that the developing countries with                FRIEDMAN:     In thinking about the economic work at the time,&#13;
&#13;
whirh the World Bank          ~as     dealing-- remember at this point it is very           J vas very impressed (to apeak in tl'rms of myself) with the fact that&#13;
&#13;
largeiy India, Pakistsn and countrif's of that kind-- were simply not                       IDA resources were very scarce.        It already vas clear from the&#13;
&#13;
in a posit ion to aprvicf' without great difficulty their debt to the                       Pxperience of IDA before 1964 -- 63, 64 -- thst there vss a very&#13;
&#13;
World Bank--not that they would default, but that much morl' assiatanee                     vigorous demand for IDA-type-funds.        There had been some earlier&#13;
&#13;
could   ~P   givPn to tht&gt;m morP effectively if it vas on a much more                       discussions in various places of whether or not there really would be&#13;
&#13;
concessional basiR.            So I think he was always a very strong advocate              the absorptive capacity, or whether there would be the demand for that&#13;
&#13;
for increasing lhP         si~e      of IDA.                                                kind of funds.        But that clearly wasn't the experience.     The experience&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      Did he    ev~r    talk about some specific size--three or four                 vas that    there~      a atrong de.and for IDA funds. We were dealing with&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            3                                                                                       'â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
allocate these scarce resources, both among countries and by different                       want to ask a little about that.            What is the Bank    bac~ground   of that&#13;
&#13;
users within countries.                                                                      world     Wa~    this a principal preoccupation of the Economics Cotn111ittee?&#13;
&#13;
      Also, since we were part of the World Bank Group, as "'e later                         Was it true that therf' was a very clear cut-off point ir. terms of per-&#13;
&#13;
began to call it, we had to have some way of keeping in mind that IDA                        capita income that separated IDA eligible countries from Bank borrowing&#13;
&#13;
countries were at the same time likely to be, in small or large                              countriE-s?&#13;
&#13;
proportion, also World Bank countries; so that we had to have a notion                       FRIEDMAN:       Well, I think that on that, as I recall it, it was something&#13;
&#13;
of what makes sense in terms of the division within the Benk of access                       that came up in the Economic Committee but was largely organized by the&#13;
&#13;
to the World Bank itself or to IDA or a mixture of the two. It was                           Economics Department.          It vas really inspired by what was being done&#13;
&#13;
pretty clear all throughout this period that, at least as far as IDA                         in the Monetary Fund at the same time.             It waa part of my mandate of&#13;
&#13;
Countries were concerned, there also would be access to the World Bank.                      co~ing    to do with the World Bank what I had done in the Monetary Fund&#13;
&#13;
There might be a large group of countries that would only be World Bank                      which vas the       syst~atic    collection of necessary data for analysis,&#13;
&#13;
and not IDA worthy.             They would be very largely found in the Western              doing the analysis itself at headquarters and then in consultation with&#13;
&#13;
HPm ispherf'.                                                                                the countries.        We began that program, I forget exactly when, but we&#13;
&#13;
      As far as Asia vas concernf'd, the other big region of developing                      began that program fairly soon after I came to the Bank, and we kept on&#13;
&#13;
countrif's, you're going to have countries which were the bulk users Â·of                     improving it, hopefully, over the years as long as                was there.    We&#13;
&#13;
IDA resources, but simultaneously they would be borrowing from the                           kept on trying to make it better and better in tf'rms of coverage, the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank.        The   si~e    of the World Bank would depend a lot on the size            frequency of the consultation and the content of these consultation&#13;
&#13;
of IDA.     The aseumption in the case of a country like India or Pakistan                   reports.        I don't know if that's what you are aiming at in terms of&#13;
&#13;
is that you'd rather do it through IDA if you could, but that the IDA                        asking these questions.&#13;
&#13;
lending would simply not be enough, so there would also be more World                        OLIVER:     Well, how about the cot-off line in terms of per-capita&#13;
&#13;
Bank lending.                                                                                income?     The reason I ask that is because I came across the case of&#13;
OLIVER:     In the Woods Collection at the Columbia University Library, I                    Nigeria, which was a country having a higher level of income per-&#13;
&#13;
have come across country analyses                     atatietical analyses with an           capita than other countries that were alleged to be eligible for IDA,&#13;
&#13;
additional qualitative evaluation of various potential borrowing                             but there was simply a qualitative assessment that Nigeria should&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         5                                                                               6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
indPrd bâ&#128;¢ an IPA country          be~ausp,   in   ~pite   of its relatively high            being greatly odd; it   s~emed   to be working backwards.   Woods would&#13;
&#13;
in~ome,   it had so mo!'ly other problE'm&amp;.                                                 constantly come up and ask mE' (sometimes this came up at the&#13;
&#13;
FRIEPHAN:     Well, it     ~as   about this time that Nigeria discovered oil                President's Council) if I had a better def in it ion. I wasn't able to&#13;
&#13;
in commPrcial availability, which influenced people's thinking                              come up with any. The combination that we used was per-capita income&#13;
&#13;
about Nigeria.         I think one of the interesting things that was going on              and population, and that remained; and out of that grew a division of&#13;
&#13;
at this time was a constant asking of questions of                How~       you allocate   countries il'ltO high income, middle-income, and low-income, which we&#13;
&#13;
the IDA funds?        This came up repeatedly. I myself was pretty unhappy                  used and which we very arbitrarily set, in my opinion.&#13;
&#13;
about the fact that we allocated on the population basis and the so-                              We did have an Economics Department -- that was done in the&#13;
&#13;
called per-capita income basis with a cut off, because that meant                           Economics Department, and I think you will find when you talk to Andy&#13;
&#13;
really, by that definition, that the poorer countries, as I thought at                      JCamarck, if you heve a chance, he will know a lot about this.      That was&#13;
&#13;
the time, were kind of like the tail wagging the dog.                                       one of his special jobs at that time.      We would divide the developing&#13;
&#13;
      It isn't ae though we had all the IDA funds we thought were                           countries by some standard of per-capita income, as per-capita income&#13;
&#13;
desirable.     We had a limited amount of IDA funds, and, therefore, we                     vas the agreed way to allocate IDA funds, multiplied by population.&#13;
&#13;
got a definition of poorest countries which was really greatly                              That gave a very, very strong bias toward an Asian IDA fund, because&#13;
&#13;
influenced by this scarcity of IDA funds.                 Our definition of poverty,        the poorest countriea in terms of any kind of measured GNP (there were&#13;
&#13;
1n my opinion, got to be too low.             You know, you've got a middle-income          few exceptions like Haiti in the Western Hemisphere) were found in Asia&#13;
&#13;
country that will pay you $500 per capita.                 In my view, it is hardly a       rather than in Africa. The way the GNP was calculated resulted in lover&#13;
&#13;
middle-income        country~    It waa middle income only in terms of the IDA              per-capita income in Asia than in Africa, because Africa didn't have&#13;
&#13;
Rt&gt;pl&lt;:â&#128;¢nislunent.                                                                          the huge population that Asia did.      So you got the anomaly that poor&#13;
&#13;
      There were so many countries with large populations (largely India                    countries in Africa were sometimes looked at as !'lot as IDA-eligible as&#13;
&#13;
and Pakistan -- to eome extent Indonesia, but India and Pakistan                            these massive poor countries in Asia.      That troubled me at the time and&#13;
&#13;
particularly, especially at this time) which were such large users of                       still does.&#13;
&#13;
IDA funds.     Bet~een     them India and Pakistan, I think, accounted for                  OLIVER:   Turning away from IDA to other issues -- 1 think we can talk&#13;
&#13;
nearly 70 to 75 percent.           The definition of poverty got to be greatly              about this briefly because it has come up before.      It was a major Woods&#13;
&#13;
influenced by the availability of IDA funds, and that struck me as                          initiative, as I understand it, to help support the International Finance&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                         8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Corporation by   havin~   th~   Bank    mak~   loans   dir~ctly   to it.   Was             had been the result of a functioning economy, you would have had a&#13;
&#13;
it also a major Woods     initiativ~      to begin to drop        countri~s   from         demand for imports as a counterpart.       ln the case of Thailand, this&#13;
&#13;
Bank lending eligibility because their incomes were too high-- countries                   wasn't happening because this was truly an enclave type of situation&#13;
&#13;
like Japan and Thailand.                                                                   which influenced only a few economic activities.&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:   Well Japâ&#128;¢n, and Australia may already have had it.                                       l don't know if you know this story, but I think it is&#13;
&#13;
I   think Thailand was a very jntereating case and it's worth                 co~nting.    interesting and is a commentary on the World Bank at that time.&#13;
&#13;
For one thing it reflected the"difficulties of administering this kind                     Thailand had a very, very large increase in its monetary reserves, and&#13;
&#13;
of rule.                                                                                   so the question that arose was:       Should a country which has a   ~ery&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Thailand on the per-capita income scale was not that high.                    It    large increase in its monetary reserves continue to be a Bank recipient&#13;
&#13;
wasn't even the complication that you got in the oil countries, where                      even though its per-capita income is not high?       We finally decided that&#13;
&#13;
the per-capita income vas very, very, high, but you have to take into                      we couldn't justify using scarce resources for countries that had these&#13;
&#13;
account that you're dealing with a dual economy in which a very small                      very high monetary reserves.       We were in the midst of the Viet Nam War,&#13;
&#13;
portion of the economy is       g~nersting     huge incomes. This would disguise           and no one had a judgement on how long this windfall vas going to&#13;
&#13;
the fact (Jran would be an outstanding case) that the great bulk of the                    endure.&#13;
&#13;
population really lived tn       v~ry   poor conditions and were part of the                         was sent out to do something about this. I spoke to the people&#13;
&#13;
less developed world. They were not part of the modern world despite                       whom      knew well in the Ministry of Finance and the Deputy Governor of&#13;
&#13;
the per-capita income of their countries.                                                  Thailand.     It was interesting, very interesting, at least I found it&#13;
&#13;
      Thailand was, in a way, a more interesting case.                The Thais were       ao, that at that time the Deputy Governor, who was a woman and vas well&#13;
&#13;
getting the same thing as oil revenues from U. S. military                                 known to the people in the Monetary Fund and the World Bank, told me&#13;
&#13;
expenditures.     Thailand was a poor country; it vas clearly a poor                       quite confidentially, aod privately, "Please don't cut off World Bank&#13;
&#13;

built a few air fields and manned these airfields.                 Like the early          public works, and one of the few things that we do here which is not&#13;
&#13;
years in the Phillipinea, for the Thai economy those airfields were a                      corrupt are the World Bank projects.       We use them as our standard; we&#13;
&#13;
tremendous source of foreign exchange which vas huge relative to the                       use them as    8   way of getting better performance from our own people.&#13;
&#13;
needs of a poor country not generating a demand for imports.                     If this   If you pull the World Bank out of it, corruption will just go on; it&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         13                                                                                  14&#13;

br   abl~    to aiiPnd   ~omr   other lunch.     He   (~It   that going to    th~   luncheon   and the Horovitz proposals.     Indeed when I got to the Rank, thry    we~e&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that Paul Hoffman was giving was something he'd like to show that                              given to me simultaneously as two studies the Bank had undertaken to do&#13;
&#13;
Hoffman was welcomed.           In these various ways, he was very friendly.                   on behalf of UNCTAD.&#13;
&#13;
      IJNCTAD was a more interesting case, because UNCTAD, from itÂ· s very                            At that time, Dick Demuth had already stâ&#128;¢nted to work on this. (lie&#13;
&#13;
beginning under Prebisch, was in the of habit of criticiLing the                     ~ore      had not started to work on supplementary finance.)      Dick was the brain&#13;
&#13;
cons~rvstive      (cautious, call it what you will) people in developed                        trust or the strategic planner of the Bank.       If there was any one&#13;
&#13;
countries who identified Prebisch with the Economic Cou.iaaion for                             person in that group from the President's Council that personified&#13;
&#13;
Latin America and a more radical approach to development.                     (He was          strategic planning in action, it was Dick Demuth. So I very quickly&#13;
&#13;
r~slly      in his own way, 1 guess, the leading Third World            spokes~an       for    came to the conclusion that 1 would be glad to help out on the Horowitz&#13;
&#13;
those years in history             not just that year, but maybe for those                     Proposal, but that it should remain Dick's project.       I remember riding&#13;
&#13;
decades of history-- the 50s and 60s.)                A lot of people shied away               home with Dick and telling him that.    He seemed to be quite pleased; he&#13;
&#13;
from UNCTAD.       In particular, if you talked to people in the financial                     wasn't going to lose what had become a pet project already.        As far as&#13;
&#13;
c~unity,       both in the      govern~ent   and in the private sector,                        1   was concerned, I would be glad to help out;    and I did help out in&#13;
&#13;
the feeling was that UNCTAO was kind of silly.                 It was a group of               that I vent on missions to various countries to find out what I could&#13;
&#13;
people who got together and made speeches and wasn't going to amount to                        about the Horowitz proposal, but I didn't take the leading role in the&#13;
&#13;
anything.      To me it was quite interesting that at the time we tended to                    Horowitz Proposal aa I did in Supplementary Finance.&#13;
&#13;
have that view in the Monetary Fund.             We were, among ourselves, very                       The Horovitz proposal was, in ita own way, quite well received.&#13;
&#13;
disparaging of these people.                                                                   Indeed it was a proposal that never died.     It was a proposal which got&#13;
&#13;
      Now when I got to the World Bank, I found that Woods was very                            reflected in the    fo~tion   of the Trust Fund years later in the&#13;
&#13;
pleased to cooperate with UHCTAD.              He didn't really care, it seems,                Honetary Fund,     The idea that you would subsidize interest payments by&#13;
&#13;
about this reputation that UHCTAO had. Woods was very friendly. He                             the poorest countries so that they could in effect continue to borrow&#13;
&#13;
probably met Prebisch a couple of times.               I don't remember anything               from the multilateral development banks is something that was thought&#13;
&#13;
very intimate between them, but Woods surely was very supportive of me                         of as something quite straight forward.&#13;
&#13;
when I found myself, for the first time, very closely cooperating with                         to the Horowitz Proposal, except that I don't think it was pursued 1n&#13;
&#13;
UNCTAD in these resolutions.           The two were the Supplementary Finance                  UNCTAD.    It got shelved in UNCtAD along with most everything that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               I5                                                                             16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
UNClAD did.     I don"t think that it rvrr got ratifird.     I think it just     we made in supplementary finance.     Commodity agrepments had been kind&#13;
&#13;
dird a quiet death.                                                              of stalemated, in any event, by the fact that the major countries were,&#13;
&#13;
          think it"s fair to say Dick tended to be very supportive of            by and large, very divided, the United States being very adamant in our&#13;
&#13;
things which expanded the scope of the World Bank.       He was very             position and the British having their own concepts of commodity&#13;
&#13;
institutional minded. If it built the Bank and, in this case, IDA as             agreements as being related to the Sterling Area or the Commonwealth.&#13;
&#13;
well as the IFC or ita relations with UNDP, I think Dick was for it.                  The French were very much in favor of commodity agreements.         They&#13;
&#13;
have a vague and general memory that he saw the Horovitz Proposal aa             were the intellectual leaders at this time.     The Germans were just&#13;
&#13;
not fitting in with the operation and philosophies of the World Bank             beginning to become intellectual leaders in this field -- just&#13;
&#13;
itself, aa being a complication in the life of the World Bank.         1 don't   beginning to.     The Canadians were pretty active.   They were generally&#13;
&#13;
remembrr that there were ardent supporter&amp; of it.        In fact, I think if     on the aide of the United States on commodity agreements, but commodity&#13;
&#13;
anything we probably helped to put it away, but, aa I aay, in this case          agreements were just not getting off the ground.       Still, we continued&#13;
&#13;
I think Dick Demuth's recollections would be much better than mine.              to cooperate very closely with the Coffee Agreement people in London&#13;
&#13;
OLIV~R:     Well, it could have been subsumed under or, in some sense,           end did a lot of technical work for them.&#13;
&#13;
obviated by the    Suppl~ntary   Finance Proposal, I should have thought.        OLIVER:     Would you comment on Woods' peraonal relationship with leaders&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     That's what surely happened in practice.     There vas one         in the various countries, both developed and less developed.      Were&#13;
&#13;
other thing, going on too, Bob, which vas the World Bank's relations             there countries that he was particularly fond of, in some sense anxious&#13;
&#13;
with international commodity agreements.      We had, for example, in the        to work with?&#13;
&#13;
World Bank quite close staff relations with the International Coffee             FRlEDHAN:     The impression I had vas that, on the developing country&#13;
&#13;
Agreeme~t    which vas headquartered in London and which, at that time,          aide, he was very much at ease with the Indians and Pakistanis.      He&#13;
&#13;
vas really the moat important single commodity agreement in actual               thought a lot about their problema and met with their people.      He also&#13;
&#13;
operation.     We never ceased to be cooperative with them.                      vaa proud of the close relationship with the Japanese he had formed in&#13;
&#13;
   Drag Abramovic spent a fair    ~ount   of his time working on commodity       his work at Firat Boston.     He was intrigued by the rising movement 1n&#13;
&#13;
problema and being friendly and helpful to the people in the                     Africa.     He went to Africa, acco.panied by bottled water and other&#13;
&#13;
international commodity field.     We were never negative about commodity        personal health measurea. I don't know whether it vas he, himself, or&#13;
&#13;
agreements, but, in terms of effort, it got overwhelmed by the effort            his wife or his doctor, but there vas quite a bit of preparation to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  19                                                                                 20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
~eally     wanted to get s0111ething done, you had to deal with countrie&amp;            they choose, like the Deputies of the Ministers 1n the        nevelopm~nt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
on both levela -- on the senior civil service level and on the                       Committee and places like that, or it is one of the jobs of the senior&#13;
&#13;
political level.        He dealt on the political level and also on the              management of the Bank      helping the government.   It's    not~~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
senior civil service level, but the follow-up on the civil service                   executive board function except in the very broad out'lines. It usually&#13;
&#13;
he left to the staff.                                                                requires a resolution of the Board of Directors to the Board of&#13;
&#13;
OI.lVER:     h    it ponible that it might have irritated one or another of          Governors    authori~ing   them to negotiate replenishment.   At that point,&#13;
&#13;
the Executive      Directo~s   of the Bank -- this process of   ae~ing     to go     Executive Directors are consulted.       If they have instruction6 to be&#13;
&#13;
around the director to deal with other levels of government?                         against the replenishment budget, that would be the time they would&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:        rt's possible.   I â&#128;¢ean it'e hard for â&#128;¢e to have a                  apeak. But having sent the matter to the Governors and the Governors&#13;
&#13;
categorical position on this.         1   would suspect that the eore you            having    authori~ing   the repleniaheent, it ia not a Board job.&#13;
&#13;
investigate that, the â&#128;¢ore you'll find the leas there is to it.              In          In the Inter-American Development Bank, aa you may know, Bob, it's&#13;
&#13;
thoae days the World Bank President was not expected to go through                   a job that has been taken over by the governments.       The governors&#13;
&#13;
executive directors.        Eugene Black had not set a pattern of going              appoint somebody.       Usually a sen1or civil servant experienced in&#13;
&#13;
through executive directors as far as the Fund looked at it.             When        international negotiations would be the coordinator, and he, in turn,&#13;
&#13;
got to the World Bank, I wasn't told I had to go through the executive               is helped by the staff of the Inter-American Development Bank, running&#13;
&#13;
directors.       I was told by Burke Knapp, ''We don't bother with these             all aorta of studies for them.       But the negotiations are considered&#13;
&#13;
people the way you do in the Fund.          We respect theâ&#128;¢, but we don't --         political.     From time to time I've been aaked questions about that, but&#13;
&#13;
they ere not what they are in the Fund."          You go to the board meDJbers       I just don't know if there were some Executive Directors who, despite&#13;
&#13;
with proposals for loan decisions, lending rate proposals -- with                    what I am saying, felt that perhaps they ought to have been consulted.&#13;
&#13;
decisions that require Board action.           You went to the board from time       OLIVER:     Since we eentioned the Pearson Commission Report, is it Lester&#13;
&#13;
to time on the IDA Replenishment, but the diplomatic job of negotiating              Pearson?&#13;
&#13;
the replenisheent is not the job of the Board.           It atilt isn't.     It is   FRIEDMAN:     Yes.   He waa the Priae Hiniater of Canada at that time.&#13;
&#13;
not the job of the Board today.           It is not the job of the Board, as far     OLIVER:     Haybe you will say what you wish about the background of the&#13;
&#13;
as I know, in the Hultilateral Development Banks.           Either you see it as     Pearson Commission report.&#13;
&#13;
the job of the government -- of the Ministers of Finance and the people              FRIEDMAN:    Well, I think what ia interesting.about the background of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         11                                                                                 22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that rPport vas       th~   initiativP   tak~n    by   G~org~   Woods, particularly        FRIEDMAN:    That's right.    W~ll,     but one thing you must keep in mind,&#13;
&#13;
in v1ev of     th~   fact that, by the     tim~    it came out, he had nothing to          Bob, is that we ni'VI'"r thought it was going to be easy.       It was not a&#13;
&#13;
do with it.          was present when the initiative was made.             It was a        question of being discouraged by the reluctance of the developed&#13;
&#13;
proposal that was made by Woods to Pearson that he undertake a                             countries, the United States in particular.         We knew w(" hsd some&#13;
&#13;
revi~      of dl'"velopment finance and the situation in developing                        really strong friends in the Canadians and the Dutch and the&#13;
&#13;
countries.      One of the proposals was for more support for a larger                     Scandinavians.    We knew that the British would be ao-so, and the&#13;
&#13;
IDA and a larger Bank.                                                                     Germans even less, and the French not at all.          We knew what the&#13;
&#13;
           don't know whether someone elae suggested Pearson to him.                       line-up was, and we knew that the United States at best was a weak&#13;
&#13;
People like Barbara Ward come quickly to mind, because she had a                           supporter -- strong in principle, generous in its expressions of&#13;
&#13;
great influence on George Woods, and that's the kind of thing that                         support, but, when all was said and done, not prepared to do all&#13;
&#13;
Barbara Ward might have thought of.               I have no idea whether it                that much.       remember at that time stressing that Woods knew that&#13;
&#13;
originated in the true sense of the word with Barbara Ward, but                       do   we were caught in a convoy with a slow boat approach, that there&#13;
&#13;
know that he vent up there to propose that there be a high level                           were a number of countries that would keep on saying that we're&#13;
&#13;
commission composed of ministers and that it be headed up by the                           prepared to do more if the others were prepared.          People would tell&#13;
&#13;
Prime Minister of Canada.          Pearson agreed to it.           By the time it was      you that they were prepared to do more, but you never knew how they&#13;
&#13;
worked out, Woods vas out of office.                                                       would bear up in a test.       So all the time there was a sense of&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      Well, some have suggested that the real origin of the Pearson                 unreality about it.&#13;
&#13;
Coam~ission    vee the Grand Auize Speech.                                                      What really was frustrating about the IDA Replenishment vas that&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:      That's the word I'm looking for.             Go ahead.                      countries were not responding as we had hoped.          What we found&#13;
&#13;
Ol.IVER:       â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ which was given in Stockholm 1n 1966.                                    frustrating vas the    ti~e   it took       the fact that the thing go so&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:      Yes, yea.     Now who inspired that, I don't know.             At this      prolonged.    Over and over again, you know, you'd go to a meeting -- the&#13;
&#13;
point in time, ve were very eager to have ideas about how to get                           U. S. vas delayed for months, and you'd go to Europe.          Each one would&#13;
&#13;
more support for development assistance, for development finance.                          delay a little bit.    You'd go to the Germans, and they'd aay, "Come back&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      But all this occurred after two years of something of a                       next 1110nth," but you'd find that next month the Governor would say,&#13;
&#13;
struggle by Woods to-find ways of increasing the IDA Replenishment.                        "Well, it's not quite the right time.         Come back in two weeks."&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                               24&#13;

     You kf'pt on; you trif'd to get them tog.,ther, you'd do the obvious      G~rmany   out of the foreign aid, you'rp not going to    g~t   it.     You want&#13;

things.     Ppople like Burke   ~napp   worked very hard to accelerate the     to give foreign aid to the World Bank.       Look at George here and aee&#13;

Replenishment -- in Brazil, Woods got the idea of having a meeting, an         work." That was one of the more memorable little exchanges that took&#13;
&#13;
informal meeting of Schiller and Fowler, Michael Sharp and â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ I           place at the meeting.&#13;

&#13;
the British. I forget who it was.        At that time, it vas rather amusing   end the practice.      The practice continued until it finally came to an&#13;
&#13;
because Woods had hoped that by getting them together â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ Nov we've        end; and, of course, the Americans, by this time, had compromised&#13;
&#13;
got the Governors and we've got them in one place and they are all             their original support of the billion dollars a year to something less&#13;
&#13;
ministers.     We might be able to accelerate the pact. We hed this            than that.&#13;
&#13;
informal â&#128;¢eeting, at which        guess the only two members of the staff           I was the one that came up with the idea that we could accept the&#13;
&#13;
were Burke and myself, and they got involved in talking about all this         idea that $1 billion waa the level per annum we were trying to reach&#13;
&#13;
delay and vhy didn't tbey get on with it.                                      at the end of th.e three year IDA period. Let's get up there by gudual&#13;
&#13;
     At this point, it is the Ger.ana who are delaying it, and                 stages. We were constantly being negotiated around. That vas the&#13;
&#13;
Shiller, Minister of Economy, I gueu they call it in Germany, aaid.-           frustration of it. We just couldn't seem to get to an end.            Of course&#13;
&#13;
"The only thing we really care about ia the non-recognition of Eastern         that has been the experience ever since.       All of the replenishments&#13;
&#13;
Germany.     What we really want to have ie countries not     recogni~e        have alvaye been drawn out.      The first IDA Replenishment had one&#13;
&#13;
Eastern Germany.     That's what we want to use our foreign aid for.           unique character:      it vas the first.   It vas the time when you learned&#13;
&#13;
IDA, the World Bank, doesn't help in that at all." I forget wbat               about how difficult it vas to get a whole group to agree.            But the&#13;

FRJEDHAN:     Well, I think the PE"arson Commission Report vas, in its own               contribution was, but it couldn't have been as much as a $100 million&#13;
&#13;
way, a major event.        They   broug~t   together somE" good people on   t~e          a year, and Schiller -- did I say Schiller?        I mean Strausa, the big&#13;
&#13;
Pearson Commission.        They had an extravagant etaff in terms of bringing            budget man, the powerful guy in the budget -- Strausa vas saying how&#13;

togethrr a very large staff and keeping it there for a couple of yeara                   Germany could not afford this money.        I couldn't resist saying that I&#13;

development finance, but the stream of history had turned against                        OLIVER:     What did Strauss say?&#13;
dE"velopment.     We were sensitive to this in the '60s, but it took,                    FRIEDMAN:     He didn't say anything.     He just smiled. Strauss is a very&#13;

&#13;
not really committed to       develo~Pnt      aaaistance.   Development aaaistance       just said it out of sadness.        The Germans weren't at all unpleasant&#13;
&#13;
really had a low priority.          Bilateral assistance, when needed for                about this.      They weren't disagreeable in any way. They treated Woods&#13;
&#13;
political-military reasons, had a much higher urgency.                                   with great courtesy and kindness, but it vas like trying to go up the&#13;

&#13;
going to accomplish it.       In that aenae, it was public relations, but we              effort.     This was the time of the Montreal Exposition. (It was all&#13;
&#13;
were at least all in agreement that, whether we accomplished it or not,                   during Woods' time).      This was the time when they decided they would&#13;

it was a good thing to advocaLe.                                                          ca-memorate the hundredth anniversary in Canada.         It was time to have&#13;

&#13;
defeated in the end. I don't think we seriously said:               Â·~ell,   we're        through private channels for development assistance.        1 think that was&#13;
&#13;
not going to get this.       Ia it right for ua to be advocating it?"             The     Escott Reid.     It didn't work, but we used it at the time.        We said it&#13;
&#13;
view that we had, which we all had was that we ought to advocate thia.                    was hard to do that with the public, but, if the fellows in Canada&#13;

If we didn't get out thefe and advocate something, you wouldn't get                       could take a lead in the IDA Replenishment â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
anything.    You'd get very, very little.         You needed people to get out                 Everytime we worked on the IDA Replenishment, whenever we were in&#13;
&#13;
there -- and go out on a limb. You had the asaurancea that at these                       trouble, like we needed another quarter of a percent here or a lead&#13;

places, in particular in Canada and the Netherlands, you had countriea                    there, I alvaya found that I could call the Dutch or the Canadians, in&#13;

Bank.     I had gone to     B~azil    a nUbber of times for the Monetary Fund.            FRIEDMAN:     Very little actually.          All I can aay is that I knew that&#13;
&#13;
Within months after I changed to the World Bank, I vae in Brazil                          Woods waa very enthuaiaetic about the expanded work in agriculture and&#13;
&#13;
talking about reopening relations with the World Bank, and 1 vas                          education, and I vas a aupporter of it, though I had very little&#13;

getting a very warm reception.              Brazilians were pleased with Woods and        responsibility for it, except that it might involve the economics of&#13;
&#13;
his attitude toward Brazil.                                                               shadow pricing.       I'm not sure that you might not get a different&#13;

FRIEDMAN:     There were two different iaauea in the caae of consultative                 answer fro. Andy      ~amerck   than   fr~    me.    Andy tended to be more&#13;

groups.     One was the distinction between conaultative groups and                       intimate with the lover staff, the middle staff of the Bank than I&#13;
&#13;
consorts.     Woods vas very much in favor of the idea ve should atop                     vas, because he had been one of their colleagues.                In retrospect, I&#13;
&#13;
doing arm twisting as we were doing in the consortia and be willing to                    don't really know how much Andy vas involved with eome of this work on&#13;

bringing creditors together with the borrowing countries and other                                  The one thing that I got much more involved with vas&#13;

interested agenciee, without erm twisting the donor countriee.                  My role   population because I had really becoâ&#128;¢e quite convinced by the time&#13;

&#13;
direction of Dick Demuth.            Dick vas the one who master-minded it, and           achieving material well-being.          I got to know Bill Draper at that&#13;
&#13;
we were supportive of it.            Dick regarded me as a warm ally in hie               time, which was not related to my World Bank position.                It's just that&#13;
&#13;
efforts to expand the role of developers.                At that time, Dick propoaed      I felt that his concern with population made a lot of sense.                      When I&#13;

&#13;
countries in which ve would have consultative groups.                                     much more concerned with population?                There I ran into a hailstorm of&#13;

&#13;
wssn-t a    si~ple   formula like that which the Fund finally worked out.       personal affection too.       It wasn't just a collegial relation.     He&#13;
&#13;
The Fund was interested in compensatory financing in trying to find             regarded Paul Hoffman as belonging to his caste.       He vss someone he had&#13;
&#13;
unconditional sources of DOney.         The Fund was always riding the two      known before either became involved in public affairs.       They had known&#13;
&#13;
horses:     on one hand, more conditionality, on the other hand, some           each other in their private lives.&#13;
&#13;
funds, some liquidity creation. So you had the gold traunche and the            OLIVER;     Had First Boston ever helped finance Studebaker?&#13;
&#13;
easy credit traunche before compensatory financing.                                             don't know.    It surely wouldn't surprise me if they had&#13;
&#13;
        Compensatory financing in the Fund is in the spirit of How can we       because that's the kind of league Studebaker was in.       That's the kind&#13;
&#13;
make something   BQ1     conditional7   In the World Bank it is different.      of league First Boaton and its predecessors were in.       These people&#13;
&#13;
The Supplementary Finance Scheme is really in the spirit of How can we          obviously knew each other, and Dick Demuth, who vas in charge of&#13;
&#13;
make it conditional?         How can we uae the assistance that we give at      relations with the UNDP, was conatantly coming up with suggestions of&#13;
&#13;
the time not only as a way of providing the needed resources but also           more intimate relations between the UNDf and the World Bank. At the&#13;
&#13;
of making sure that the resources would be used for the defenee of              President'a Council this would be reported and was constantly being, as&#13;
&#13;
development.     This meant, of course, that we would give a high priority      far as I can recall, supported by Woods.       I think Dick Demuth's&#13;
&#13;
to what they were doing with the relevant program.         It wasn't going to   recollection on this would be better than mine, but my impression was&#13;
&#13;
be automatic.        It vas just a very different view of the function of       that Dick was busy trying to think of ways in which we might become&#13;
&#13;
balance-of-payments support.                                                    the executing agency for the UNDP,       As the UNDP grew in size,&#13;

about that, but let's bring in UNDP, for example, and UHCTAD                    Woods was very pleased when l told him I'd been invited to come to&#13;

&#13;
al rf'ady not nf'ady as good as we havE&gt; for World Bank projects."             mixed up. My recollection of it is that the supplementary finance idea&#13;
&#13;
     I struck a deal with thE&gt;m whereby everything that ve would give to       would be, to take Thailand a&amp; an example (which we didn't use as an&#13;
&#13;
Thailand they would plough back to buy World Bank Bonds.          Our~         example).           I think I can apply it correctly.&#13;
&#13;
outflow went to   ~E&gt;ro,   but they would continue to have what they                   If Thailand had been projecting that it vas going to earn $2&#13;
&#13;
perceived (more clearly than we had perceived) to be the great benefit         billion a year in foreign exchange, let's say $1 billion from the&#13;
&#13;
of World Bank activity.       I found this, at the time, a very interesting    airport (from the American presence in thailand) every year from 1965&#13;
&#13;
exampiP of somE&gt; of the qualitative contributions that the World Bank          to 1970; and if Thailand had gone ahead and the international community&#13;
&#13;
vas making to devE&gt;lopment.      In terms of numbers it really wasn't all      had agreed to it, ao this vas nov a program that has been scrutinized&#13;
&#13;
that big, but obviously the Thais, who always did run a       pretty           by the World Bank and the same figures would be given by the Monetary&#13;
&#13;
intelligent government, were so aware of their difficulties and their          Fund     -- major international institutions have not found fault with&#13;
&#13;
needs that they really placed a very high value on the presence of the         this projection -- investment decisions based upon it would have been&#13;
&#13;
World Bank in their country.                                                   regarded as reasonable. If the United States, say, in 1967, pulled out&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   That's a very interesting story.      It induces to me ask, in       of Thailand unexpectedly and export earnings fell from $2 billion to $1&#13;
&#13;
passing, whether or not in your own thinking about supplementary               billion, ve would deal with the $1 billion short fall.       In dealing vith&#13;
&#13;
finance, which we talked about yesterday, the size of a country's              it, ve would take into account the fact that the country had access to&#13;
&#13;
international reserves should be taken aa a major indicator of the             ita ovn monetary reserves and access to the International Monetary&#13;
&#13;
need for supplementary finance.       Yesterday, it sounded aa though we       fund.     What ve didn't do -- if I remember correctly, and I think I&#13;
&#13;
were talking solely in terms of fluctuations in the export earnings of         remember this -- we did not assume that they could go to the private&#13;
&#13;
the country.    In the case of Thailand, ita export earnings in some sense     markets and finance imports out of the commercial banking system.&#13;
&#13;
were rising because of the American bases in Thailand.       I take it that    That's why I said I think    auppl~ntary     finance had a lot to do with&#13;
&#13;
might of been used as an indication that they would not have been              the evolution of commercial    ban~   lending.&#13;
&#13;
eligible for supplementary finance.                                                    We didn't provide alternatives for countries in difficulties in&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:      hope my memory is not playing tricks on me, Bob, I really       sufficient magnitudes.     I'd be very surprised if we did not assume that&#13;
&#13;
hope so, because I have lived with a lot of problems since then.         You   one of the first calls that would be made by the country in external&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
deal with the   unfavo~able     climatic or health conditions there.               FRIEDMAN:     Maybe Giscard.      He could take advantage of the fact that&#13;
&#13;
     One of the people he loved to tell about was Nkruma, because he               these Ministers of Finance were his Governors.            He would see someone&#13;
&#13;
went to Nkroma at one point, and Nkruma vas a very vigoroua and                    like Schiller in Germany, and Michael Sharp, Minister of Finance, in&#13;
&#13;
important leader of African nationalism. He vas very, very taken with              Canada.      It vaan't alwsye the Head of State, but it vas et the&#13;
&#13;
Nkruma and loved to tell the story of how he vas invited out to the                Hinietry of Finance.       That was quite helpful, beceuse he was able to&#13;
&#13;
Nkruma'e house over a weekend. Nkruma had invited him to meet his                  transform the issue of IDA, not into a technical discussion among&#13;
&#13;
family and his children.        He wâ&#128;¢s having a very nice time, and, when he       people in the civil service, but into a political discussion of what&#13;
&#13;
got through, he turned to Nkruma and said, "Boy, you're really a White             they really wanted to do in the field of development assistance.              In&#13;
&#13;
Han aren't you?"       Looking back on it, he thought very highly of Nkruma        the course of that, he developed some very close relations with&#13;
&#13;
that he didn't take offen8e. Nkruma might have been disturbed.            Woods    people like Csllaghan, for         exa~ple,   and with the Canadians. This ves&#13;
&#13;
vas very Unpressed with the fact that Nkruaa understood co-pletely. It             the forerunner of the Peareon report.            He got along with Pearson.&#13;
&#13;
was not a racist reaark;        from George Woods, it's a high compliment to       He had already been en admirer of Pearson, and he thought that&#13;
&#13;
be called a White Man.        Woods used to tell that story a number of times      Pearson vas the right kind of guy to hold a -- let's see what did&#13;
&#13;
as a pPrsonal experience that he enjoyed having.                                   they call it     th~n,   I forget the words, holding a scrutiny -- it's a&#13;

OLIVER:     Nkruma had spent enough time in the United States, so aa to be         biblical term -- of the world development situation.&#13;
&#13;
reasonably familiar . â&#128;¢ . â&#128;¢                                                        OLIVER:      Sounds like a seminar to me.&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     To know that expression.         In Western Europe, however, Woods   FRIEDMAN:      No, no. it wasn't a     â&#128;¢~insr,     It vae more like an&#13;
&#13;
tried very hard in the IDA Replenishment to get to deal vith people at             inquiry. He knew Pearson from the old days.            He invited me to come&#13;
&#13;
a very ienior level.         He did it personally -- to get to see people like     with   hi~   to have   l~nch   with Peareon in Canada, and Pearson hed his&#13;
&#13;
Callaghan, the Chancellor of the Exchequer; or to see Streusa who, at              principal ecoomaic and fi11andal â&#128;¢iniatere.            Woods did not do much&#13;
&#13;
that point was a very powerful figure in Germany; and to see -- I                  with the civil service.          He was trying to see the people at the top&#13;
&#13;
forget who it vas in France.            It vaa not DeGaulle.                       level.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Michel   Debr~   perhaps?                                                     He seemed to be quite teken with Andrew Cohen, who was head at&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Maybe, perhaps it vas.                                               that time of the foreign aid agency.            This vas the time when he was&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Giacard?                                                               very friendly vith Barbara Werd.          He had this idea that if you&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
into   troubl~.   Ind~ed, wh~n   I   tried to   g~t   Woods to say something in         population Pxpert.     J sneaked in population by the back door by not&#13;
&#13;
hiR spePches, he told me that other membprs of the staff had told him,                  having to hire someone.       I knew Woods wasn't against it.    I was&#13;
&#13;
if you do this, maybe you would get some of the f.xecutive Directors,                   getting this from the administration, and that wasn't my first problem&#13;
&#13;
but the Hexicans won't like this and the Brazilians won't like it.                      with administration.     I found the administration people were, in a&#13;
&#13;
Even the Argentinians won't like it even though they had one of the                     very nice and polite way, stone walling.        We don't need to change the&#13;
&#13;
lowest population growth rates in the world.             In aome mysterious way,        Bank.     If ve do, remember we are bankers, and ve don't do things that&#13;
&#13;
they managed to hold down their population growth rate while at the                     give us an image other than of a very solid bank.       So l didn't get to&#13;
&#13;
same time in principal they were opposed to family planning and did                     hire a population expert, though we went on to do a lot of work in&#13;
&#13;
not try abortion.                                                                       population.&#13;
&#13;
       Woods was being told he'd better not say anything in Brazil, but                 OLlV&amp;R:     Sy 1970, there was a full-fledged Population Division in the&#13;
&#13;
he was friendly with people like John D. Rockefeller 111 who shared                     Economics Department.&#13;
&#13;
very much the point of view that population growth vas an important                     FRIEDMAN:     That's right.   That â&#128;¢an became head of our first divieion.&#13;
&#13;
complication for developing countries.           Woods lent his moral support,          We did establish a division.&#13;
&#13;
but that was all.     I identified a population economist at Princeton.                         When McNamara came, a lot of thinge changed, partly because Bob&#13;
&#13;
(Princeton at that time already had, still hae, one of the leading                      himself vas a realty etrong supporter of doing something in the&#13;
&#13;
develo~ent    study groups in the American academic world.)              This vas a     population field.     Much more than Woods.    Bob was involved in&#13;
&#13;
young man    who had gotten a five year fellowship et Princeton to do e                 contraception and the pill and other things.        Shouldn't we help&#13;
&#13;
PhD in development economics, which at that time ia atilt very rare.                    finance research? and ao forth.       We vent considerably further than I&#13;
&#13;
I tried ~o get him hired in the World Bank.             1 did not succeed.     It vas   had even euggested to Woods, because I don't remember Woods ever&#13;
&#13;
the only appointment that 1 remember where I was specifically turned                    turning me down.&#13;
&#13;
down, and I waa turned down on the grounds that it would be                                     The other thing I think, Bob, in understanding this period of time&#13;
&#13;
inappropriate for the World Bank to have a development economist end to                 is that the preoccupation with Viet Nam had not yet been transformed&#13;
&#13;
identify itself thereby with an interest in population control.                         into e view that we had to do something about development.           That's in&#13;
&#13;
       I got somebody who was an Englishman on our staff and dealt with                 the '70a.     It was very incomplete in the '60s.     In the '70s, you get&#13;
&#13;
national income analysis and things of that eort, and he becaâ&#128;¢e my                      people like McNamara, who have been very active in the Viet Nam War,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  33                                                                                     34&#13;

&#13;
Co1â&#128;¢ntries. That"s not a correlation that has existed in the '60s.             N~    had heard frequently the names of Douglas Dillon and David&#13;
&#13;
and then in the '60s you have a guy like          HcN~ara   saying, "You know if     Rockefeller.         At the time, it vas probably viah fullfilling,&#13;
&#13;
we had more    develo~ent     assistance, maybe we wouldn't have this great          aaeumed that George Woods might decide to stay on.&#13;
&#13;
social instability that leads to thinga like Viet Nam."            But that's not            I knew from my experience in international institutions, that an&#13;
&#13;
the usual thing.     The usual thing is We've got Viet Nam, and that's               incumbent nearly always haa an option to stay.            He might have a lot of&#13;
&#13;
enough on our plate.      We've got our      probl~a.   We've got inflation.         people criticizing, but the fact ia that the persons who were&#13;
&#13;
Why do we need to worry about development assistance?                                appointed were persons of         ~inence   and diatinction with euccesa in&#13;
&#13;
      There was a kind of liberalization that vent on in the '70s:             the   their record.        Woods vaa not regarded as being aa aucceaaful as&#13;
&#13;
acceptance of interest in aubjecta like education, health, literacy,                 President of the World Bank aa he had been aa Chainaan of First&#13;

&#13;
People atilt were stingy about providing money, but they were much                   and outstanding personage.&#13;
&#13;
more open-minded about what should be the content of development, much                       Hy memory ia that 1 atill regarded Woods as one of the candidates&#13;
&#13;
~re   open-minded that you ought to be concerned with social as well as              ~ntil    t heard someone elae'a point of view.          I remember people telling&#13;

OLIVER:     But now there is a counter attack,                                       be head of the World Bank.          1   r~ember   feeling dieappointed, not&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Exactly.    The 'BOa are different than the '70s.                      because 1 had any atrong feelings about McNamara, but becauee I still&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Did the appointment of McNa.ara surpriae you?         The tradition      wanted George       ~ooda   to stay on.   Hy disappointment was that there waa&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank had been to have 808eone fro- the New York investment                    no point in drea.ing any more about Woods' staying"on.             Aa far as 1&#13;
&#13;
com.uoity, like John J. HcCloy.           Then suddenly a man appeara who had        knew, Douglaa Dillon and David Rockefeller were perfectly            r~apectable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
been with the Ford Motor Company but vas not thought of, in New York                 na-ea.     Stories l heard about Wooda and Dillon and Rockefeller really&#13;
&#13;
st leaat, â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ being a leading investment banker.                                      ceâ&#128;¢e later.     Wooda had retired to New York, end ve were having lunch&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Well, I don't    reme~ber    how aurprieed I was, but I would          together; we were chetting about theae thinga.             t got insights   fr~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
dare to say now that I was surprised.           I personally had not heard hie       him looking backwerds that t didn't have at tbe time.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       35                                                                            36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        l think in the World Rank, we also felt that one thing about the               enough to carry the weakness on his back, and he just kept on doing&#13;
&#13;
McNamara appointmrnt         ~as   that he vas a very   ~inent    person, that there   what he thought he wanted to do.&#13;
&#13;
was no question about his being a petson of great prestige.                 I think         I don't remember whether I expected any particular changes.&#13;
&#13;
my own feeling about McNamara vas that he vas a numbers man.                 I think   Probably not.    Hy ovn experiences going back in the Fund and the Bank&#13;
&#13;
my concern with McNamara's interest in numbers proved to be very well                  vas that senior staff changes on the top were very important, but they&#13;
&#13;
founded.                                                                               weren't threatening.     There would be change, but nothing changed all&#13;
&#13;
        When     met McNamara for the first time in my life, I vent in to              that much.     I reslly don't remember having any great premonition that&#13;
&#13;
see him.          ~emember   having a splitting headache.        I'm sure it vas       McNamara would bring in anything bad.        Woods vas very quick to tell me&#13;
&#13;
tension at the time.          I offered to resign.      I vas the one person whom      how pleased he was that McNamara vaa appointed.        He had already&#13;
&#13;
Woods had brought in in a kind of se.i-personal way.                I vas the only     pointed out to me a particular speech McNa.sra had made in Canada&#13;
&#13;
one who had a level of administrative function as a new vice president.                which Woods very much    a~ired.   As fsr as I was concerned, I didn't&#13;
&#13;
I vas The Economic Advisor to the President.              J had an advisory role as    know McNamara.     I knew of his involvement in the Viet Nam War, but&#13;
&#13;
an important part of my relationahip with Woods.             Woods thought of me       that didn't tell me anything about what kind of person he vu.           If&#13;
&#13;
as an advisor as well as head of the economic personnel and economic                   George Woods spoke well of him, chances were that I would too.&#13;
&#13;
work.                                                                                  McNamara vas a disappointment because I enjoyed my relations with&#13;
&#13;
               suggested to Hr. McNamara that he would want to have his ovn            George Woods.    As far as I vas concerned, the most pleasant&#13;
&#13;
advisor.       He said, "Oh no, Irving, l've heard a great deal about you.             appointment for me would have been the continuation of the asme&#13;
&#13;
I want you to stay.          But you have to pr0111 ise me. â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢      You know I        person.&#13;
&#13;
have a weakness for numbers.            Please protect me from .y weakness for         OLIVER:     In Mew York, vho were the persona George Woods counted on and&#13;
&#13;
pumbers."        I tried.    Jt worked for about six months.        h worked fine      thought of as his close friends?     Nelson Rockefeller is always&#13;
&#13;
because I would remind him that he had told me to protect him.                 8ut     mentioned.     Why Nelson Rockefeller in particular?     And who else was at&#13;
&#13;
after awhile, he forgot his own admoniehment.              1 think he got quite        that level?&#13;
&#13;
resentful when I reminded him of what he told me.                It's interesting      FRIEDMAN:    Well, there vas the Kaiser family, in California.      They&#13;
&#13;
because he understood his own weakness very well, but he                               were very close to him.&#13;
&#13;
underestimated the strength of his own personality.                He vas strong       OLIVER:     That vas for business reasons.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          37                                                                           38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:       No.   It   b~gan   with   busin~9s r~asons,   but   th~   imprea6ion       a great deal of affection, people that he knew well and felt at ease&#13;
&#13;
got from Woods was that he had been introduced into the family aa kind                     with.     J don't think he felt at ease with probing political columnists&#13;
&#13;
of a   fost~r    father for Edgar Kaiaer.          Edgar Kaiser had introduced             like David Broder, but these were gentlemen columnists who talked&#13;
&#13;
Woods to his children aa being sort of their uncle.                  You know, very        about New York and the world.&#13;
&#13;
peraonal.       When he got a bad leg, a circulation problem, they aent a                          Douglas Dillon, he thought well of, but how often he saw Douglas&#13;
&#13;
plane and brought him out to California to the hospital.                   When Wooda      Dillon, I have no idea.     Obviously there were coharta at Firat Boston&#13;
&#13;
needed a plane to go anywhere,. it waa the Kaisers who supplied him with                   like Patberg, who, unfortunately, at this time had already comedown&#13;
&#13;
personal servicea.          He felt very     wa~   about the Kaisers.       I don't know   with cancer.     He was Woods successor and was on the verge of retiring&#13;
&#13;
how much he aaw of the Kaisera in New York, but he went frequently to                      or had juat retired.     George Shin had become chairman.   George Shin&#13;
&#13;
California after he left the World Bank.                                                   waa not from Firat Boaton. He came from Merrill Lynch, but clearly&#13;
&#13;
       Then, ae you mentioned, Nelson Rockefeller.              The other                  these were people in New York who were like George Shin.        Woods vaan't&#13;
&#13;
Rockefeller he aeemed to feel very wanaly about was John D.                                that friendly with Andy Overby, who waa our mutual friend.        He would&#13;
&#13;
Rockefeller lll, who was quite active in the Japsn Society.                    Wooda       aay nice thinga about Andy, but I didn't get the impression that he&#13;
&#13;
was very interested in Japan, and he waa very interested in the                            would aee thatÂ·much of him.     Ae far al   knew, outside of David&#13;
&#13;
population issue.          John D. Rockefeller was chairman of a population                Rockefeller, he wasn't into commercial banking.     He knew people like&#13;
&#13;
group, and he got Woode to be deputy chairman.                Nelaon Rockefeller waa       Wristen in Citibank, but I don't think they were cronies tn any sense&#13;
&#13;
Governor.       Woods was very friendly with Nelson Rockefeller who got him                of the word.     Ria cronies were relatively few.&#13;
&#13;
quickly involved in the bond market and the rating of New York State                               He wae a great admirer of the Rockefeller Foundation.       remember&#13;
&#13;
and the difficulties it was having in arranging fonda.                    He thought       on two or three occaaion1 we'd be sitting somewhere, I forget exactly,&#13;
&#13;
Wooda would atraighten that out for him.                                                   and eomebody might say that the Ford Foundation was the largest&#13;
&#13;
       Andr~    Meyer ia another name that he mentioned with great                         foundation; end he would turn to me, very irate, and said, "Nothing&#13;
&#13;
affection.       I have no idea how often he aaw these people. Sulzberger                  can compare to the Rockefeller Foundation."     He had thia great&#13;
&#13;
ia another name he mentioned.              There are individuals like Ruasell              admiration for the Rockefeller Foundation, and I'm sure there were&#13;
&#13;
Baker of the      ~     York   ~.         One other person, a colu.niat from the           individuala in the Rockefeller Foundation who Wooda might have&#13;
&#13;
New    ~ ~            was Tom Wicker.       Theae are names that he mentioned with         identified personally with.     They were not part of my group, so I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   39                                                                                   40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
don't know exactly whom he had in mind, but the Rockefeller Foundation               philoaophic tenba.      He vas a great admirer of the American system.&#13;
&#13;
could have been a burden to him instead of an example of American                    Not in any fraudulent sense.        His whole interpretation of it vas very&#13;
&#13;
Society at ita beat in taking care of people.                                        personal.      Not that he had views that were unique to him, becauae&#13;
&#13;
       He   ~as   very inciteful.    We vould have interesting converaatione.        obvioualy Horace Greeley and others had thought of this before.             I&#13;
&#13;
For example, we would talk about education.          In moat caaea be would          don't think he had read Horace Greeley.        I think this vas hie&#13;
&#13;
initiate the conversation; he would like to talk about education in                  perception coming out of hie own experience.        So for   â&#128;¢e,   he vaa a very&#13;
&#13;
New York City.          He vaa a great advocate of free education,      makidg the   interesting conversationalist.        I never had a dull ma.ent having lunch&#13;
&#13;
point that the whole secret of New York City, at least ita great                     with George Woods, and I had lunch with him _.ny, many, many times.&#13;
&#13;
strength, vaa that one generation after another of immigrants -- the                         It vas never dull because Woods would take any subject and&#13;
Engliah, then the lriah, then the Ger.ana, then the Jews, then the                   per1on1lize it.      There wasn't 1nytbing that vent on in the world that&#13;
&#13;
                  had   ~~   to New York and Boaton, and there they had found        be didn't have a view about.        He vae a great advisor to me.       Whenever&#13;
&#13;
the benefit of a free, higher education; and, through higher                         I would talk about going into buaineaa or aomething like that, he&#13;
&#13;
education, theae i . . igranta had 111ade their    ~ay   into American Society.      would eay, "Oh, Ining, you can't do that.          Buaineas aucceaa is not&#13;
&#13;
This vas â&#128;¢ real insight from his point of view as to vhy American                    what you think.      Bu1ine1a aucceee ia being able to buy and keep a file&#13;

&#13;
them the education they needed to compete in the American World.              He     theee thingâ&#128;¢Â·"&#13;
&#13;
vould love to illustrate thie vith people be vould â&#128;¢eet.             "See that               Be had thia way of debunking a lot of stuff that people were&#13;

College), and nov you can see what he ia.          He i1 the head of                 n:ternal debt probleaa, and he would eay, "If you want to know about&#13;

       He seemed to take great delight in the mobility of American                   you more in a half an hour thanÂ· all thele jokers viii tell you in&#13;
&#13;
society.      He never talked about hia own mobility.       When you talked to       daya.     The people he debunked -- he vas not debunking academics              he&#13;
&#13;
him, you wondered whether he vae talking about himself.            He~               vaa debunking the     chaira~an   of thia bank or "That guy; he'a just a bond&#13;
&#13;
talk about hUDaelf.          He vas always talking about this in semi-               salea111an."    111at'a the vay be could dismiss aomeone like Bill Simon:&#13;

"Just a bond       sal~;&gt;sman.   Secretary of Treasury?    That's a joke."                      social group.     He didn't refer much to social groups.    He didn't&#13;
&#13;
       He was a     v~&gt;ry   sophisticated person with a great deal of knowledge                 really refl'r to the fact that "I had dinner with eight people," or&#13;
&#13;
and a very debunking attitude with many people, but yet he wasn't                               something like that.       "I had dinner with the former French Ambassador.&#13;

&#13;
fraud.      I   really was very iaprpsaed with Woods.       You couldn't              i~press   He was a very one-on-one kind of person, and I think that it would be&#13;
Woods with your position, or your money, or the way you looked, or thl'                         hard, Bob, to put together a picture of him, because everybody in this&#13;
homl' you had, or thl' clothing you wore, or the car and the chauffpur                          one-to-one relationship sees only a fragment and probably baa a&#13;
you had driving around.           It juat didn't impress hiâ&#128;¢ at all.              I   found     different perception of the person because of this one-to-one&#13;
he had a very, very attractive peraonality that way.                                            relationship.     He vas rarely on stage.    You rarely saw him in a&#13;
      The thing that waa so interesting, Bob. vas be never                  sa~       in me a   public, generalized capacity.      He was always a very intimate person in&#13;
&#13;
replication of hUmaelf.           You know it wasn't as though be greatly                       the aenae of dealing with him aa an individual.&#13;

admired you because hl' saw you as a somewhat younger edition of                                     I'â&#128;¢ sure my view of Wooda ia very different from that even of&#13;
&#13;
himself.         vaa a completely different person.        Hl'    â&#128;¢â&#128;¢~   me as an                people who were contemporaries of mine in the World Bank with&#13;

            In March 1974, July and December 1985,
            June 1986, and February 1988, Irving S. Friedman was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver and Charles Ziegler.
            During his tenure at the Bank from 1964 to 1974, Mr.

            the World Bank (1964-1970); as chairman of the economic
            committee (1964-1970); and at the Economic Development
            Institute (EDI) as professor in residence (1971-1974). His
            transcripts exist as a seven volume set, consisting of one
            session in 1974 and eight sessions from 1985 to 1988. His
            transcript concerns his tenure at the Bank after working for
