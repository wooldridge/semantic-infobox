            Concessions - the way to privatize
            infrastructure sector monopolies
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Under concession arrangements, the state
            delegates to the private sector the right to provide a
            service, yet retains some control over the sector by
            incorporating in a concession contract or license the terms
            and conditions that will govern the infrastructure project
            or company. This approach is well suited for privatizing
            sectors with monopolistic characteristics. This Note
            outlines the concession-type approach and some of its
            operational implications. Designing a concession that
            strikes the balance among the interests of the investors,
            the consumers, and the public authorities and that fits the
            conditions of both the sector and the country requires a
            clear identification of the objectives and tradeoffs. Each
            concession is likely to be a special case requiring special
            attention and unique features.
