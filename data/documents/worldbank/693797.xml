CAMBODIA: URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A.   WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   Cambodia has abundant natural fresh water sources--the Mekong and Tonle Sap&#13;
Rivers, rainfall of up to 3,000 mm in the highlands, and plentiful groundwater--yet at the&#13;
most, only 32 percent of the population have access to clean water. Water coverage in&#13;
Phnom Penh, though better than rest of the country, is low by international standards.&#13;
This is particularly troubling, because until the late 1960s, Cambodia's water supply&#13;
infrastructure was better than many of its neighbors and provided residents with 24 hour&#13;
service. Today, even where piped water is available, its quality is questionable and&#13;
service is intermittent.&#13;
1.2   Access to sanitation is even worse, with just 16 percent of the population covered,&#13;
since only those in the built-up areas of the largest cities and towns are connected to&#13;
wastewater systems. Moreover, these are nothing more than open drains that collect&#13;
rainwater and wastewater, which are then discharged untreated into open watercourses&#13;
and lagoons.&#13;
1.3   As a result, diarrheal disease is endemic. Further, infant mortality rates at 115 per&#13;
1,000 live births and morbidity statistics are among the worst in the world. It is estimated&#13;
that water-related diseases account for an estimated 30 percent of all hospitalizations.&#13;
1.4   These conditions are largely the result of nearly 25 years of political strife, when&#13;
the water infrastructure was completely neglected: No investment was made or&#13;
maintenance carried out from the 1970s through the early 1990s. At the same time, the&#13;
number of skilled manpower dramatically declined, along with institutional capacity, and&#13;
water utility records were destroyed, which made it nearly impossible for the utilities to&#13;
deliver sustainable services.&#13;
1.5   Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA), which draws its water from the&#13;
Mekong and Tonle Sap Rivers, has two water treatment plants. Both were rehabilitated&#13;
after 1991, have a combined capacity of 110,000 cubic meters a day, and produce water&#13;
that meets WHO standards. The distribution system extends for 307 km, with pipes of&#13;
varying condition. While there are currently 39,000 legal connections, which covers&#13;
about half the population, consumers only receive water for an average of 12 hours a day.&#13;
The other half of the population must purchase water from vendors or neighbors--at far&#13;
higher prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.6  In the provincial cities, coverage is considerably lower and distribution is&#13;
inequitable. In the port city of Sihanoukville, for example, an estimated 11 percent have&#13;
access to piped water provided by the Sihanoukville Water Supply Authority (SWSA):&#13;
The system has just 750 working connections, and another 250, which do not operate due&#13;
to lack of water supply. Tankers deliver untreated water from a freshwater lake to&#13;
another 6 percent and the rest of the residents get water from shallow wells, vendors and&#13;
rainwater.&#13;
1.7   Responsibility for different services is fragmented among various organizations&#13;
and ministries: PPWSA is under the Ministry of the Interior, while SWSA and other&#13;
provincial water utilities are within the Unit of Potable Water Supply (UPWS) in the&#13;
Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME). The Municipality of Phnom Penh&#13;
(MPP) and the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) are responsible for&#13;
sanitation and wastewater infrastructure, while the Ministry of Rural Development is&#13;
responsible for rural water. The Ministry of Environment is also involved, and the&#13;
Department of Hydrology of the Ministry of Agriculture collects hydrological data, but&#13;
has no authority to manage the country's water resources (see Table 1.1).&#13;
Table 1.1: Institutional Responsibilities&#13;

1.8   This complex structure further weakens an already limited institutional capacity.&#13;
Thus, intervention is urgently needed in two areas: First, targeted investments must be&#13;
made into water supply facilities; second, policies must be designed to introduce best&#13;
practices in order to assure the projects can be completed satisfactorily and sustained,&#13;
once operational.&#13;
B.   RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WATER SECTOR&#13;
1.9   Despite severe shortages of qualified and experienced staff, water utilities in&#13;
Phnom Penh and the provinces have progressed remarkably in the past three years. Since&#13;
1993, PPWSA received $61 million, principally in grants, from France and Japan, to&#13;
rehabilitate the city's water supply infrastructure, while a UNDP/ World Bank Technical&#13;
Assistance Project (CMB /91/007) helped finance TA, training, skill development, and&#13;
studies, along with essential spare parts and equipment. At present, the Asian&#13;
Development Bank (ADB) is funding a water supply project that complements the&#13;
proposed IDA credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
1.10 Assistance from the international community was also responsible for launching&#13;
PPWSA on the road to commercialization. However, it must still improve its operational&#13;
and financial management before it can function as a commercial water utility. For&#13;
example, PPWSA continues to have one of the highest ratios of unaccounted for water&#13;
(UFW) in Asia (about 57 percent), although the ratio is profoundly better than in 1993,&#13;
when it topped 80 percent.&#13;
1.11  Another $6.7 million of donor assistance financed the rehabilitation of the basic&#13;
water supply in provincial towns. For example, in Sihanoukville, SWSA rehabilitated its&#13;
collapsed system with UNDP/World Bank technical assistance, and basic service has&#13;
been restored. Besides installing meters on all its connections and rehabilitating its water&#13;
treatment plant and pumping stations, it improved its accounting and billing/collections&#13;
systems. At present, the utility covers its operating costs, although it still cannot finance&#13;
new source developments to meet current demand. However, before the utility can move&#13;
to this stage, it needs to reorganize its structure in ways that will promote financial&#13;
sustainability, commercial practices and staff accountability.&#13;
1.12 IDA's 1994 Emergency Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2550-KH) along with&#13;
Dutch assistance helped rehabilitate systems in five other provincial towns (Kampot,&#13;
Kampong Chain, Svay Rieng, Prey Veng and Takhmao), which have doubled the&#13;
population with access to piped water--from an average of 15 percent to 33 percent--and&#13;
generally improved water quality and hours of service. But they still only operate eight&#13;
or less hours a day and produce water quality below WHO standards (see Annex 1 for a&#13;
description of progress at the Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville utilities).&#13;
1. .13 Although the physical rehabilitation of the water systems completed to date has&#13;
been essential, the key element in the utilities' dramatic progress has been the motivation&#13;
of dedicated staff to acquire skills and information. Before 1993, PPWSA had only five&#13;
engineers, while the other water utilities did not even have staff who could read meters.&#13;
By 1994, PPWSA had 21 engineers and 28 trained technicians, completed the&#13;
computerization of its billing and collections, and created a program to address&#13;
distribution problems.&#13;
1.14  The progress is especially impressive given the country's severe constraints.&#13;
First, the trade embargo of the 1980s restricted Cambodia's access to materials and&#13;
equipment (such as good quality pipes) that were needed to maintain the infrastructure.&#13;
Second, years of centralized managerial and administrative practices had emphasized&#13;
conformity, discouraged individual initiative and separated the incentives to perform&#13;
from productivity. Moreover, until recently, the water utilities were run as government&#13;
departments with no financial or operational autonomy: PPWSA was an arm of the&#13;
Municipality of Phnom Penh, under the Governor's control, its revenues were pooled&#13;
with general municipal funds, and municipal authorization was needed for all operational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
expenditures. Third, and more fundamentally, no legal or regulatory framework existed&#13;
to guide policy and practice.'&#13;
C.   GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND POLICY&#13;
1.15 The Government approach to the sector is presented in its First Socio-Economic&#13;
Development Plan, 1996-2000, which accords water and sanitation a high priority, both&#13;
to tackle one of the root causes of poverty and to improve public health. It allots US$160&#13;
million to the sector over the period (see Table 1.2).&#13;

Total                                 139.5          20.5          160.0&#13;
Source: First Socio-Economic Development Plan, 1996-2000&#13;
1.16  According to the document, PPWSA will become a self-sustaining commercial&#13;
entity, based on full cost recovery, and meet WHO standards for water quality. For their&#13;
part, provincial water utilities will develop technical expertise and become financially&#13;
self-sustaining. The strategy is to transform these utilities into autonomous, commercial&#13;
institutions that will serve at least 70 percent of residential consumers and the majority of&#13;
industrial and commercial consumers.&#13;
1.17  The Plan also describes long-term objectives for sanitation and wastewater&#13;
disposal, which will be increasingly important as water supply in the towns increases.&#13;
For Phnom Penh, it proposes to develop a strategy for collecting and treating sewage,&#13;
septage and surface run-off from low-lying areas, so that new infrastructure can be both&#13;
financed and maintained in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. However, before an&#13;
investment program can be developed, sanitation policies must be devised that designate'&#13;
the roles and responsibilities of PPWSA, the municipality, households and neighborhoods&#13;
in terms of choosing service levels, financing investments and operating and maintaining&#13;
the systems. The strategy for the provincial towns will be developed after experience is&#13;
gained from Phnom Penh.&#13;
1.18  During the Plan period, the Government aims to rehabilitate and expand water&#13;
supply in Phnom Penh, develop technical and operational expertise, and establish a legal&#13;
basis for converting PPWSA into a fully commercial, financially self-supporting water&#13;
For example, there is no overall water law; all that exists are some normative standards for providing&#13;
service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
utility. The goal is similar for the 22 provincial towns, which would ultimately be&#13;
expected to supply water to at least 75 percent of the population.&#13;
1.19 With respect to policy, the Government passed an irnportant law on the General&#13;
Status of Public Enterprises, in June 1996; it affects their operation, governance and&#13;
supervision, and grants them independent legal status and a degree of financial autonomy.&#13;
However, these entities were still subject to various State controls and placed under a&#13;
'tutelle' Ministry (see Annex 2). Then, in December 1996, the Government approved&#13;
Decree No. 52, which established PPWSA as a public enterprise and obliged it to operate&#13;
according to commercial practices and prepare annual business plans. Specifically, the&#13;
Decree was designed to:&#13;
(a)   End the pooling of PPWSA's revenues and expenditures with the&#13;
municipality, which was a major disincentive to the utility;&#13;
(b)   Make Government financial support to the utility more transparent, as&#13;
PPWSA would now be a specific item in the national budget;&#13;
(c)   Empower the utility to cut off all public and private customers for non-&#13;
payment;&#13;
(d)   Enable PPWSA to charge Government/administrative consumers&#13;
prevailing tariffs; and&#13;
(e)   Empower it to develop its own personnel policies, including incentives for&#13;
higher productivity.&#13;
1.20 Although the law only provided limited autonomy and fell short of the ideal (as&#13;
discussed in Annex 2), given the country's administrative, regulatory, and political&#13;
constraints, it was an important first step. More important, by transforming PPWSA into&#13;
a commercial enterprise that will respond to consumer demand, the Government has&#13;
signaled its commitment to reforming the sector. Further, the lessons from PPWSA's&#13;
current projects will be invaluable when the Government restructures the other urban&#13;
water utilities.&#13;
1.21  At present, senior policy-makers agree the country needs a national strategy for&#13;
sustainable and cost-effective urban water supply and sanitation services. Also, they&#13;
recognize the institutions need to be rationalized so consumer preferences and willingness&#13;
to pay form the basis of service. To this end, the Government has moved to simplify the&#13;
daunting maze of sectoral responsibilities by creating a Coordinating Committee of senior&#13;
representatives from the ministries involved (MIME, Rural Development, Public Works&#13;
and Transport, Environment, Economy and Finance), and from the Council for the&#13;
Development of Cambodia and the Phnom Penh Municipality. Its task is to recommend a&#13;
medium-long term sectoral strategy.&#13;
1.22 Chaired by MIME's senior representative, the Committee will identify the best&#13;
course to streamline the sector institutions and prepare a statement on:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
(a)   The responsibilities of principal stakeholders, including government&#13;
agencies, water utilities, the private sector and consumers with respect to&#13;
the urban water supply;&#13;
(b)   Ways to administer the utilities at the lowest level possible;&#13;
(c)    Legal and regulatory structures that delineate roles and responsibilities of&#13;
national sectoral agencies, and support the new sector policies;&#13;
(d)   The manner in which PPWSA and other urban utilities will become self-&#13;
financing and operate according to commercial principles;&#13;
(e)    Ways for the national budget to assist low-income consumers;&#13;
(f)    Mechanisms to coordinate donor support to the sector;&#13;
(g)   Mechanisms to set and regulate tariffs; and&#13;
(h)   The sector's overall investment strategy.&#13;
1.23 As a first step, the Government sent a letter to IDA in April 1997 (Annex 3)&#13;
which confirmed its goal to increase the availability of water and sanitation services,&#13;
according to user demand; also, that it endorsed the principle that water should be treated&#13;
as an economic good, and should be managed at the lowest administrative level&#13;
appropriate. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Goverrnent will (a)&#13;
present a strategy for the development of water supply and sanitation services in&#13;
Cambodia by December 31, 1999, and furnish a formal statement of sector policy&#13;
acceptable to IDA by December 31, 2000; and (b) furnish IDA, at mid-term review, a&#13;
report on the progress achieved in applying its provisions.&#13;
D.    KEY ISSUES&#13;
1.24  The sector currently faces four related issues:&#13;
*  Inadequate service. Water supply is inadequate throughout the country, and&#13;
sanitation coverage is even lower. This presents enormous obstacles to&#13;
improving public health and expanding industrial activity.&#13;
*  Inadequate response to consumer demand. With more stable political&#13;
conditions, demand for water has increased. But, because coverage is&#13;
inadequate, users have turned to expensive private alternatives: Vendor-&#13;
supplied water in Phnom Penh is about 10 times PPWSA's average tariffs.2&#13;
2&#13;
2   In the provincial towns of Kompong Speu, Bantey Menchey and Takeo, demand is so great that&#13;
private investors are currently negotiating with MIME to supply water services at substantially higher&#13;
tariffs than the public sector rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Limited institutional capacity. This profoundly affects all aspects of the&#13;
water systems. The country has few water supply/sanitary engineers3 or staff&#13;
trained in management, finance and accounting. Further, water utilities do not&#13;
have enough staff with basic skills, such as the ability to read water meters or&#13;
repair plumbing equipment. Thus, those with skills and experience are&#13;
severely stretched.&#13;
* Inefficient, fragmented institutions. As mentioned earlier, responsibilities&#13;
stretch across various agencies, which delays decision-making and leads to&#13;
high transaction costs, duplicated efforts, and perverse incentives.&#13;
E.    LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.25  The proposed project is IDA's first investment in Cambodia's water sector.&#13;
However, previous and on-going IDA-financed projects in the country, which include the&#13;
Emergency Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2550-KH), the UNDP/World Bank TA Project&#13;
for Water Utilities (CMB/91/007), the Phnom Penh Power Rehabilitation Project (Credit&#13;
2782-KH) and the Social Fund (Credit KH-PE-37088), offer important insights into&#13;
problem areas. These include: (a) a lack of familiarity with IDA procurement procedures;&#13;
(b) delayed and inadequate counterpart funds; (c) weak implementation capacity; and (d)&#13;
weak coordination among the principal donors (especially Japan, France, the Netherlands,&#13;
Germany, the EU and the ADB). Further, the Final Report of the Joint Ex-Post&#13;
Evaluation Mission of the Water Utilities TA Project identified PPWSA's lack of&#13;
financial and management autonomy as the most important constraint and stressed that&#13;
projects should not be based on promises of reform. Thus, the issue of PPWSA's&#13;
autonomy was addressed during project preparation.&#13;
1.26 Issues described in the Bank's Water Resources Policy Framework, which is&#13;
based on Bank experience in the sector, were addressed during project design. For&#13;
example, the Framework suggests that services will most likely be sustained if they are&#13;
consistent with what consumers want and are willing to pay for, and managed at the&#13;
lowest administrative level possible. More detailed lessons were summarized in the&#13;
Bank's 1992 OED report on water and sanitation, which stressed the need for&#13;
environmentally sustainable strategies, improved economic analysis, managerial&#13;
autonomy and arms-length regulations; also, that covenants requiring critical actions&#13;
should be included sparingly in loan/credit agreements. Instead, it noted that key&#13;
institutional and organizational changes need to be made before a project begins. Further,&#13;
a 1994 OED study on the Operation and Maintenance of Urban Water and Sanitation&#13;
identified three instruments to improve effectiveness and instill commercial discipline in&#13;
public agencies: corporatization, explicit contracts, and effective regulatory arrangements&#13;
to ensure that water pricing policies result in full cost recovery. These issues apply to the&#13;
3  It is estimated that there are no more than 30.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
proposed project, and the policy component will develop the best course through which&#13;
to address them, based on the project experience and global best practices.&#13;
1.27 The main lesson from project preparation was that technical assistance for&#13;
transferring knowledge and skills must be offered at a level and gradual pace that fits&#13;
with staff capacities. Indeed, it was found that because of PPWSA staffs high level of&#13;
motivation, the pace has been steady and predictable. Thus, the project has included a&#13;
combination of hardware and software investments that can leverage fundamental&#13;
changes in the sector.&#13;
1.28 The decision to focus on PPWSA and SWSA grew out of lessons from both&#13;
project preparation and other technical assistance efforts in the Cambodian water sector.&#13;
By first promoting changes in the relatively sophisticated PPWSA and SWSA, policy&#13;
makers can get a sense of what will work in terms of conditionalities and policy reforms.&#13;
Experiences from these two will form the basis for reforming sector policies and&#13;
institutions; the statement of sector policy will not be due until 18 months after the credit&#13;
becomes effective.&#13;
F.    RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.29  In general, the proposed project is consistent with the objectives of the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS), approved by the Board in February 1997, which identifies&#13;
rehabilitation of infrastructure as a priority area for IDA assistance to Cambodia.&#13;
1.30 Also, the Bank's Water Resources Management Policy states it "will give priority&#13;
to countries where water is scarce or where the problems of water allocation, service&#13;
efficiency or environmental degradation are serious." While water allocation is not yet a&#13;
major issue in Cambodia, the country clearly fits the other criteria.&#13;
1.31   Specifically, the rationale for IDA involvement is that while the sector has&#13;
received sizable external assistance--far more than what IDA has given or proposes in this&#13;
project--the sector still needs more investment capital. Indeed, unless Phnom Penh's&#13;
water supply is expanded immediately, other transmission and distribution projects in&#13;
different parts of the city, assisted by the ADB and Japan, will not be sustainable.&#13;
1.32  Equally important, authorities must work out and fine-tune the sector policies,&#13;
before the water utilities can respond to the pent-up demand for service:4 It was only with&#13;
a recently approved ADB project that the issue of tariff hikes for Phnom Penh was&#13;
tackled as a condition of the loan. However, other issues have not been adequately&#13;
addressed and IDA's global experience in the sector can make the crucial difference&#13;
between success and failure of Cambodia's policy reforms. The unresolved issues are&#13;
how best to:&#13;
4   So far, the largest inflow of external assistance in the sector has been from bilateral sources, and these&#13;
have focused on specific investments, technical and training support to the water utilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
(a) Expand and sustain water supply in Phnom Penh and provincial cities;&#13;
(b) Reduce the water utilities' dependence on donor and Government assistance;&#13;
(c) Involve consumers in decision-making; and&#13;
(d) Expand sanitation services in a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable&#13;
manner.&#13;
G.   RATIONALE FOR THE PROJECT&#13;
1.33 The project focuses on Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, the country's two largest&#13;
cities, because a significant share of the urban population lives there and, in the case of&#13;
Phnom Penh, its water utility is more capable than those in the provincial towns. Thus, it&#13;
has the best chance of demonstrating that service can be sustained when appropriate&#13;
policies are adopted and investments are well funded. Also, the city accounts for a&#13;
twelfth of Cambodia's population, and the number is rising with in-migration. Also,&#13;
from a low base, PPWSA has improved coverage and efficiency (see Annex 1), is the&#13;
country's best-run water utility, and has enough capacity to implement and sustain the&#13;
proposed investments. However, far more of the residents need to be covered, service&#13;
must be sustainable and the utility's capacity must be profoundly improved. Besides&#13;
having the second largest population, Sihanoukville is Cambodia's major port, has the&#13;
greatest potential for industrial, touristic and commercial growth, and faces problems&#13;
typical of provincial towns. Thus, the lessons learned will provide important examples&#13;
on how to expand service and commercialize operations along the lines described in the&#13;
First Socio-Economic Development Plan.&#13;
1.34  During project preparation, three alternative strategies were considered with&#13;
respect to sequencing. One was to delay physical investments until the institutional and&#13;
policy framework had been worked out. However, this was rejected because: (a) water&#13;
supply conditions in urban areas are critical and delaying investments would harm the&#13;
urban population, especially the poorest; (b) since the IDA credit, designed to finance&#13;
investments at Phnom Penh's water treatment plant, will complement the ADB and&#13;
Japanese investments in distribution systems in other parts of the city, delays would&#13;
threaten the sustainability of these on-going projects.&#13;
1.35 A second was to develop institutional and regulatory measures, together with the&#13;
Government, that would facilitate private sector participation. However, this was&#13;
considered premature because the economic, legal and regulatory environment5 must be&#13;
clarified before private firms will be interested in participating. A third was to expand the&#13;
project scope to include sanitation investments, but this was rejected because it would&#13;
entail complex project design and financing arrangements. Instead, the project will help&#13;
the Government guide sanitation investments in a cost effective manner once the&#13;
institutional foundations have been laid.&#13;
It is thought that private sector interest in the Cambodian water sector will increase once the project's&#13;
institutional objectives are accomplished.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.1   The objectives of the proposed project are to:&#13;
a) Improve drinking water coverage and quality in Cambodia's two largest cities&#13;
on the basis of effective demand;&#13;
b) Improve the water utilities' technical and economic performance;&#13;
c) Widen the availability of (non-drinking) water for commercial and industrial&#13;
purposes so as to spur economic growth and ensure the utilities' viability;&#13;
d) Help the Government develop a long-term investment program based on well-&#13;
articulated water and sanitation policies.&#13;
2.2   To achieve these objectives, the credit will finance a first phase of investment in&#13;
much needed physical infrastructure, and provide technical assistance for strengthening&#13;
sector institutions and water utility management in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville.&#13;
B.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.3   The proposed Urban Water Supply Project will be implemented over the five-&#13;
year period, 1998-2002, in three components. It will: (a) expand water supply in Phnom&#13;
Penh and strengthen PPWSA; (b) expand water supply in Sihanoukville and strengthen&#13;
SWSA, and thus provide a model for other provincial towns; and (c) develop and&#13;
implement water and sanitation policies for the whole sector.&#13;
Component 1: Expansion of Phnom Penh's Water Supply (base cost US$ 29.17 million).&#13;
2.4   This component includes five sub-components and will increase the quantity of&#13;
treated water in Phnom Penh by expanding the facilities' physical capacity and improving&#13;
efficiency. The city's water system has a distribution network of about 307 km of pipes&#13;
(80 percent are over 40 years old), two pumping stations, five reservoirs with a total&#13;
capacity of 24,500 cu. m/day, and two treatment plants: Phum Prek and Chamcar Mom,&#13;
rehabilitated with Japanese and French assistance, can produce 100,000 cu. m/day and&#13;
10,000 cu. in/day, respectively. The total of 110,000 cu. m/day is completely utilized. A&#13;
third treatment plant--the Chruoy Chang War--on the bank of the Mekong River, has not&#13;
operated since 1983 due to damaged raw water mains and deteriorated facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
2.5   Subcomponent 1: Water treatment plant. In 1996, the city needed over&#13;
190,000 cu. m/day for its population of about 1 million--which was 80,000 cu. m/day&#13;
more fian what was available. At prevailing tariffs, demand is expected to rise to&#13;
245,000 cu. m/day by 2000, which means capacity needs to expand by more than 130,000&#13;
cu. m/day. Although these projections do not consider the price elasticity of demand,&#13;
when combined with the current low coverage, they suggest the system urgently needs to&#13;
be enlarged. To this end, PPWSA proposes to rehabilitate and extend the Chruoy Chang&#13;
War water treatment plant, which will be able to produce another 65,000 cu. m/day.&#13;
Obviously, this will not meet the city's needs; rather, it will only satisfy immediate&#13;
demand. However, capacity will not be expanded further until the effect of increased&#13;
tariffs on demand is understood.&#13;
2.6   The feasibility study for the treatment process at the Chruoy Chang War plant&#13;
evaluated three alternatives: (a) rehabilitating/replacing the existing facility; (b)&#13;
rehabilitating/replacing most of the structures; and (c) constructing a new treatment plant&#13;
elsewhere. It concluded that alternative "b" offered the most cost-efficient course, and&#13;
possibilities for future expansion.&#13;
2.7   Prelirninary engineering designs, prepared by consultants and reviewed by&#13;
PPWSA and independent consultants, analyzed soil, topographical and hydrological&#13;
conditions, characteristics of the raw water, and the existing structures. IDA has also&#13;
reviewed them and found them satisfactory. Detailed designs for this subcomponent will&#13;
form part of a turnkey contract for design, supply, construction, installation and testing.&#13;
The subcomponents also provide for consultants to supervise construction. This sub-&#13;
component will finance:&#13;
a) Construction of new sedimentation tanks, rapid gravity sand filters and a clear&#13;
water reservoir as well as mechanical and electrical equipment to produce&#13;
65,000 cu. m of potable water per day;&#13;
b) Rehabilitation of other existing structures, including all connecting pipes,&#13;
drains and roads, fencing and lighting;&#13;
c) Construction of a new accommodation block and flow meter house;&#13;
d) Rehabilitation of two high-level reservoirs;&#13;
e) Laying of 2.5 km of 800 mm diameter transmission mains to the city network;&#13;
and&#13;
f) A crossing of the Tonle Sap River by attaching pipes to an existing bridge.&#13;
2.8   Subcomponent 2: Pipes, ancillary and leak detection equipment. The&#13;
component includes about 85 km of pipes and fittings to provide water in the southern&#13;
district of Chamcar Morn. The pipes will form the secondary and tertiary network. IDA&#13;
has reviewed PPWSA's bidding documents to procure pipes and ancillary equipment and&#13;
found them satisfactory. The component will also help finance leak detection equipment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
to tackle the problem of UFW. Specifications and quantities will be finalized during&#13;
execution, in consultation with technical assistance personnel.&#13;
2.9   Subcomponent 3: Pilot program for financing domestic connections. Phnom&#13;
Penh's water distribution system is characterized by single connections that serve several&#13;
households. This can be difficult for the poor, since neighbors often charge a high price,&#13;
well above the official tariff, also, the practice creates public health hazards, because the&#13;
receptacles used to store water are usually unclean. Surveys have found that a main&#13;
reason for the relatively small number of individual house connections is the amount of&#13;
the connection fee, which is large when compared to household income. Thus, the project&#13;
will include a pilot program whereby funds would be offered at market interest rates to&#13;
partially finance the connections and would be repaid through the water bill . If the pilot&#13;
succeeds, repayments could feed into a revolving fund for additional connections, as&#13;
PPWSA expands coverage.&#13;
2.10 Subcomponent 4: Technical assistance to improve operational and financial&#13;
performance. PPWSA has already made impressive gains in reducing the level of&#13;
unaccounted for water (UFW), through bilateral assistance from France. However, the&#13;
project will finance a specialist to help the utility lower the level even more. Another&#13;
consultant will be funded to help PPWSA improve its financial management, billing,&#13;
collections, cost control and general accounting system. Similarly, the project will&#13;
finance a computer technician/training specialist, and a water quality expert. This&#13;
component has been designed so as to avoid overlap with the TA provided by ADB and&#13;
the Japanese government.&#13;
2.11  Subcomponent 5: Twinning arrangements to develop PPWSA capacity.&#13;
Although PPWSA staff are extremely motivated and have dramatically improved the&#13;
utility's performance in the last couple years, their effort has been largely individualistic&#13;
and ad-hoc. The absence of a corporate culture has been because of the destruction of&#13;
virtually the entire institutional memory during the civil war years, when all records were&#13;
destroyed. In addition, during the years of civil war, while water supply was erratic and of&#13;
uncertain quality, consumers were given free access through the 1900 public underground&#13;
tanks constructed during the Khmer Rouge era. The significant weakness of capacity is&#13;
the absence of a working environment that promotes professional growth and encourages&#13;
transparency. Instead, progress has been entirely due to the dedicated work by a few&#13;
committed staff, which has introduced basic organizational and maintenance procedures&#13;
in an essentially ad-hoc fashion. To remedy this, the project includes a twinning&#13;
arrangement with an Australian water utility with a proven track record of serving its&#13;
customers efficiently; staff will be able to work with counterparts from this commercial&#13;
utility--both in Australia and in Phnom Penh--that uses state-of-the-art management&#13;
practices, and learn on what it takes to operate a water utility based on sound commercial&#13;
practices. Funding for the initial phase (US$250,000) has been provided by the&#13;
Australian Aid for the Mekong Basin Financing Facility. Areas of particular interest will&#13;
be in developing organizational incentives for tackling the UFW problem, improving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
billing and collections systems, responding quickly to consumer complaints, and&#13;
publishing an Annual report on utility performance.&#13;
2.12 The effectiveness of the twinning will be evaluated at the end of the first year,&#13;
when it will be decided if it should be continued or expanded. If the decision is to&#13;
continue, choice of the twin will be made according to World Bank procurement&#13;
procedures. At this stage, the arrangement could be widened to include SWSA.&#13;
2.13  The project will also support the establishment and operation of a training center&#13;
for the water and sanitation sector. The center will provide courses using PPWSA/UPWS&#13;
staff and visiting experts, rather than retain a team of trainers. Courses that are not&#13;
specific to the water sector (such as English, bookkeeping, etc.) will be outsourced&#13;
through service contracts. It will also finance some equipment and the services of visiting&#13;
experts.&#13;
Component 2: Expansion of Sihanoukville Water Supply (base cost US$3.50 million)&#13;
2.14 Until now, provincial utilities have focused on rehabilitating their facilities, and&#13;
Sihanoukville has completed this stage: Refurbished under the UNDP/World Bank&#13;
project, the SWSA now meets WHO quality standards of treatment. However, the supply&#13;
still falls far short of demand during the dry season and in general, serves only 11 percent&#13;
of the city's 47,000 residents. To make matters worse, trends indicate the population will&#13;
grow rapidly by the early part of the next century. Thus, the component will enable&#13;
SWSA to increase the quantity of treated water by 400 percent, and adopt sensible pricing&#13;
policies to reduce UFW even more. Further, technical assistance will help the utility&#13;
restructure into a commercial enterprise.&#13;
2.15 The city's water supply source is a small shallow lake held in place by a small&#13;
weir with a crest about 3.5 m above sea level. It can meet existing demand during the wet&#13;
season (May to October), but the level drops by as much as three meters during the dry&#13;
season, at which point the supply is just half of what is needed. And, while the city's&#13;
water treatment plant, built in the 1950s, has a capacity of 8,000 cubic meters a day, the&#13;
distribution system only extends for 27km. As a result, most residents obtain water from&#13;
a local delivery service that draws and supplies it--untreated--from the lake.&#13;
2.16 Water supply is critical, since Sihanoukville has a great potential for growth and&#13;
employment in the industrial and service sector (including tourism), and is key to the&#13;
country's economy. To meet this potential, investments under the project would be made&#13;
in several areas, so as to increase the daily supply to 5,200 cubic meters. This would&#13;
involve raising the reservoir's level to allow a draft of 2,100 cubic meters a day, to cover&#13;
losses incurred during treatment and transmission.&#13;
2.17 Construction Works. The lake presents several problems that project works will&#13;
resolve. First, the level will be raised through the construction of a new weir crest against&#13;
the existing bridge abutments; this will increase the storage by around 100,000 cu. m,&#13;
allowing an extra 500 cu. m per day of dry season off-take. Second, the weir (which is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
low-cost intervention) will reduce the current outflow of groundwater that geological&#13;
investigations have identified to be an amount even greater than the daily withdrawal&#13;
(2,100 cu. m). Afterwards, the draft could be increased (and sustained) by about 1,100 cu.&#13;
rn/day.&#13;
2.18  Besides work on the lake, the project will construct new wells that will provide an&#13;
extra 1,500 cu. m/day. Finally, it will expand access to water through the construction of&#13;
tanker filling stations and water selling points. This component, which includes&#13;
consulting services for design and construction supervision, will involve:&#13;
a) Increasing the storage volume of the raw water lake by raising the outlet weir&#13;
and sealing off the sand spit;&#13;
b) Constructing four new groundwater wells and related works, including a&#13;
deferrination plant;&#13;
c) Connecting wells to the distribution network, including the supply and laying&#13;
of pipes;&#13;
d) Improving the distribution system, including procuring and laying pipes and&#13;
fittings, and establishing tanker filling and water selling points;&#13;
e) Improving the treatment plant and raw water pumping station; and&#13;
f) Building another high-level reservoir within the distribution system.&#13;
2.19 Technical assistance for Sihanoukville. The component will finance technical&#13;
assistance and studies for the UPWS, including: (a) a project engineer to help with overall&#13;
planning and management; (b) accounting and computer experts; (c) a procurement&#13;
specialist; (d) a training specialist; (e) a socio-economic survey to establish the customer&#13;
base and level of effective demand for water service; (f) engineering advice to check the&#13;
design of the groundwater deferrination plant and expansion of the reticulation system;&#13;
and (g) studies on long-term water sources.&#13;
2.20 The primary purpose of the TA consultants, who will be based in Sihanoukville,&#13;
will be to help SWSA improve its operations. However, the SWSA effort will be a&#13;
model for other provincial water utilities to move from rehabilitating facilities to&#13;
introducing commercial operations. Thus the TA consultants will help MIME's UPWS&#13;
strengthen other provincial utilities (see Annex 7 for details of the Sihanoukville&#13;
component).&#13;
Component 3: Developing Water Supply and Sanitation Policy (base cost US$2.08 million)&#13;
2.21  In general, the project attempts to address both sector-wide and utility-specific&#13;
institutional issues, which are highly connected. In this report, interventions aimed at&#13;
improving institutional capacity and efficiency within the entire sector are covered under&#13;
this component; those specifically directed to PPWSA and MIME/SWSA are described&#13;
under the technical assistance components and the respective annexes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
2.22 This component will help the Government create institutions that can maintain&#13;
and expand service in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner, consistent with&#13;
public demands. However, it is the most important and difficult component in terms of&#13;
design and implementation. Cambodia is a post-Communist transition economy, and&#13;
attempts at sector reform to date have faced ideological positions that are changing, but&#13;
only gradually. Thus, the component has to balance what is optimal from IDA's point of&#13;
view, and what is possible. Excessive emphasis on the former could well lead to the&#13;
whole reform package being shelved, at high cost to the economy, while too much&#13;
attention to the latter would make the project unsustainable. Another obstacle is the&#13;
limited policy-making capacity at the national agencies. While staff at utilities like&#13;
PPWSA have acquired considerable knowledge through practical experience, those at&#13;
most ministries are not yet capable of integrating technical, financial, institutional and&#13;
economic aspects into a coherent sector policy. Thus, technical assistance will provide&#13;
consultants to the Government and help defray the costs of seminars (organized through&#13;
EDI).&#13;
2.23 The interventions proposed will help the Government develop the policy&#13;
framework for water supply and sanitation, and identify future investment priorities and&#13;
possible sources of financing.&#13;
Consultant Support to RGC&#13;
2.24 Water policy consultant. The project will finance a water policy consultant to&#13;
help the Government prepare a draft sector policy paper for water and sanitation (see&#13;
Annex 8 for outline terms of reference). The consultant will build on the results of the&#13;
first EDI serninar and the April 1997 letter of sector objectives. The Government has&#13;
requested that, once the paper is completed, another EDI seminar will be organized in&#13;
Phnom Penh to discuss the document. During negotiations, assurance was obtained from&#13;
the Government by December 31, 1999, it will develop a national strategy for water and&#13;
sanitation service provisioning, and that it will enunciate by December 31, 2000, a formal&#13;
statement of sector policy acceptable to IDA, which will form the basis of future sector&#13;
investments.&#13;
2.25 A key element in the proposed sector policy will be defining an approach to set&#13;
and revise tariffs in Phnom Penh and the provincial towns. The Government has&#13;
committed itself to the goals of setting tariffs that recover costs, helping water utilities&#13;
become commercially viable and respond to consumer demand, and developing&#13;
institutional/regulatory arrangements by which tariffs can be revised on the basis of&#13;
transparent criteria. The sector policy statement will set out the criteria in detail. It will&#13;
also describe institutional arrangements that are transparent and sound, and consider the&#13;
incentives needed for agencies to act in an economically efficient manner.&#13;
2.26 Institutional consultant. As a follow up to the EDI seminar and the policy&#13;
formulation, the project will finance an institutional consultant to help translate the sector&#13;
policy into specific actions (see Annex 8 for terms of reference). The aim is to produce a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
rational, well-defined policy-making structure, establish clear rules for operational&#13;
autonomy within the legal framework, and create mechanisms for utilities' accountability&#13;
to consumers and other stakeholders.&#13;
2.27 Sanitation and wastewater management study. The project will finance a&#13;
study for Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville that will focus on providing services based on&#13;
what consumers want and will pay for, and managing operations at the lowest&#13;
administrative level possible. The study will recommend a cost-effective solution to&#13;
urban pollution caused by untreated human waste, which could form the basis of national&#13;
policy on sanitation and wastewater management (see Annex 9 for terms of reference).&#13;
2.28 EDI Seminars. As part of project preparation, the World Bank's Economic&#13;
Development Institute held a seminar on water sector policy in Phnom Penh in March&#13;
1997 that exposed policy makers to current thinking, successful models from the rest of&#13;
the world, and various options. It also helped policy makers develop a consensus about a&#13;
vision for the future. As a result, the Government asked EDI to hold further seminars&#13;
where professionals could share information and discuss the draft policy document to be&#13;
prepared under the credit.&#13;
Summary&#13;
2.29  The issues described above were based on discussions during project preparation.&#13;
However, as other issues will surface during implementation, the assistance package&#13;
needs to be flexible. Emphasis will be on learning by doing and incorporating lessons as&#13;
the project progresses. Already, the Government took two important steps, which&#13;
demonstrate its commitment to the project's goals. First, it passed a decree that granted&#13;
PPWSA autonomy. Second, it established an inter-ministerial mechanism to coordinate&#13;
the sector (the Coordinating Committee for Water and Sanitation), which will oversee the&#13;
component.&#13;
2.30 The approach will involve a two-fold strategy. First, it will engage key&#13;
stakeholders in a continuing dialogue on policy (such as setting water tariffs,&#13;
commercializing utilities and financing operations), while learning about what works in&#13;
the PPWSA and SWSA components. Second, it will ensure that dialogue occurs at the&#13;
same time that a framework of rules and institutions is developed that can provide&#13;
sustainable water and sanitation services.&#13;
C.   COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
Project Cost&#13;
2.31  The total project cost, including taxes, duties and contingencies, is estimated at&#13;
Riels 154,565 million or US$41.64 million equivalent. Physical contingencies of 15&#13;
percent were added to works, equipment, and various other items. Price contingencies as&#13;
shown in Table 2.1 were applied to base costs, including physical contingencies. A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
constant purchasing parity exchange rate was used to convert US dollar amounts to Riel&#13;
equivalents. Table 2.2 summarizes the estimated cost of each component (see Annex 5&#13;
for detailed cost tables).&#13;

Financing Plan&#13;
2.32 The IDA credit would be lent to the RGC at standard terms, including a 40-year&#13;
maturity period, 10-years grace, standard commitment charge and at a 0.75 percent&#13;
service fee. Funds for the Phnom Penh component will be on-lent to PPWSA in local&#13;
currency at 8.5 percent fixed per annum, 17-years maturity, and 5-years grace on the&#13;
repayment of principal. The RGC would assume the foreign exchange risk. Assurances&#13;
were obtained that it will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with PPWSA, on terms&#13;
and conditions satisfactory to IDA. SWSA's loan will be assumed by MIME, but will be&#13;
recorded on SWSA's books, as if it were an autonomous, commercial enterprise.&#13;
2.33   Table 2.3 summarizes the project's net investment requirements and financing&#13;
plan after import taxes and levies have been deducted (waived by the RGC) and the&#13;
estimated interest during construction included in total project costs. Total net investment&#13;
requirements are estimated at US$39.79 million, of which the IDA credit will finance&#13;
approximately 77.8 percent or US$30.96 million. PPWSA will essentially finance the&#13;
remaining net investment through its existing cash balances and internal cash flow&#13;
projected for the 5-year implementation period. SWSA will assume a small share of the&#13;
investment requirements-the interest during construction--on its portion of the credit.&#13;

D.    PROCUREMENT&#13;
2.34 Procurement would be carried out according to the Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995, revised in January and August&#13;
1996 (see Table 2.4 and Annex 11 for procurement arrangements). The total cost of&#13;
items described includes their share of physical and price contingencies and taxes and&#13;
duties. Standard bidding documents and a standard bid evaluation report will be used for&#13;
procurement of works and goods under international competitive bidding (ICB).&#13;
2.35   The largest contract (estimated at $23.73 million) will be for the turnkey detailed&#13;
design, supply, installation, construction, and commissioning of the Chruoy Chang War&#13;
Water Treatment Plant, which includes mechanical and electrical equipment. This&#13;
contract will follow ICB procedures and bidders were pre-qualified under Bank pre-&#13;
qualification procedures; pre-qualification and bidding documents for the turnkey&#13;
contract were prepared by PPWSA and cleared by IDA. ICB procedures will also be&#13;
used for certain works and supply-and-installation activities ($2.86 million) on the&#13;
Sihanoukville water supply component, and for the supply and delivery of pipes and&#13;
fittings for the works ($2.71 million) in the Chamcar Mom District of Phnom Penh;&#13;
bidding documents for pipes and fittings were prepared by PPWSA and cleared by IDA.&#13;
For procurement under ICB procedures, domestic goods, plant and equipment would be&#13;
allowed a preference margin of 15 percent of CIF or the amount of customs duties,&#13;
whichever is lower, for bid evaluation. PPWSA will finance US$5.08 million equivalent&#13;
to install the pipes and related works in the secondary and tertiary network, which will be&#13;
procured under PPWSA procedures.&#13;
2.36 A general procurement notice was published on August 16, 1996 in Development&#13;
Business. A pre-qualification notice for rehabilitation and extension of the water&#13;
treatment plant and a specific procurement notice for the supply and delivery of pipes and&#13;
fittings were issued on June 16, 1997 in Development Business. In addition, specific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
procurement notices will be posted for all consultant contracts exceeding $200,000. No&#13;
mandatory associations between foreign and local consultants will be permitted.&#13;

4 Includes maintenance and insurance costs for computer equipment, reallocation compensation, communication costs, and local&#13;
staff costs.&#13;
5 PPWSA will finance USS5.08 million equivalent to instaul pipes for the secondary and tertiary network in the southem district&#13;
of Chamcar Mom, US$160,000 equivalent to construct the training center and US$120,000 to clean the site at Chruoy Chang&#13;
War WTP. MIME/SWSA will finance US$13,200 equivalent to improve the access road.&#13;
6 PPWSA will finance US$36,000 equivalent for equipment for the training center.&#13;
' PPWSA will finance about US$220,000 equivalent for costs of local staff (training expert, computer expert and water quality&#13;
expert).&#13;
' PPWSA will finance about US$200,000 equivalent for reallocation compensation, computer maintenance &amp; insurance and&#13;
local staff (administration staft). MIME/SWSA will finance USS54,600 equivalent for local staff (administration staff). RGC&#13;
will finance US$44,000 equivalent for local staff of the Coordinating Committee's secretariat.&#13;
2.37 Some urgently needed miscellaneous equipment (e.g. computers and computer&#13;
software) will be procured on the basis of national or international shopping as&#13;
appropriate on the basis of a minimum of three quotes for individual contracts of less than&#13;
US$50,000, with an aggregate value not exceeding US$200,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
2.38 Since PPWSA and SWSA/MIME do not have experience with procurement&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA, the project provides assistance in procurement.&#13;
2.39  Cost estimates also contain an allowance for consultants to supervise the&#13;
construction of all major works financed under this project. It was agreed at negotiations&#13;
that PPWSA and SWSA/MIME will retain consultants for all TA activities under the&#13;
credit according to terms of reference and selection procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
"Quality Based Selection" is being used to select a firm to supervise construction for the&#13;
Phnom Penh component (estimated at $930,000); the request for proposals for this&#13;
consultancy was prepared by PPWSA and cleared by IDA. In view of the highly&#13;
specialized experience required for these positions, the water policy and institutional&#13;
consultants would be individual consultants. The technical assistance personnel for&#13;
strengthening PPWSA and SWSA would also be selected as individual consultants. All&#13;
consultancy services will be procured according to the Guidelines for Selection and&#13;
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers dated January 1997. The Bank's&#13;
standard contract form will be used for consultancy services.&#13;
2.40 IDA-financed contracts above US$200,000 will be subject to its prior review&#13;
procedures. For consultancy contracts, the threshold for prior review will be US$100,000&#13;
for firms and US$50,0C0 for individuals. In any event, all TORs, including sole source&#13;
selections of consultafrs regardless of the value of contract, will be subject to prior&#13;
review. In all, about 94 percent of the total project cost will be subject to prior review.&#13;
The post review of contracts will be carried out on the basis of one in three contracts for&#13;
goods and works. Procurement information will be collected and recorded from&#13;
comprehensive quarterly reports to IDA by the project coordinator. These reports will&#13;
include revised time schedules for procurement actions including advertising, contract&#13;
awards and completion time for individual contracts.&#13;
E.   DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
2.41  The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100 percent of foreign&#13;
expenditures and 50 percent of local expenditures for the turnkey detailed design, supply,&#13;
installation, construction, and commissioning related to the Chruoy Chang War Water&#13;
Treatment Plant, including mechanical and electrical equipment; (b) 100 percent of&#13;
foreign expenditures and 30 percent of local expenditures for civil works, including&#13;
supply and installation contracts, related to the Sihanoukville component; (c) 100 percent&#13;
of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and materials; (d) 100 percent of&#13;
expenditures for consulting services; (e) 100 percent of expenditures for the revolving&#13;
fund of the pilot domestic connection prograrn; and (f) 100 percent of training&#13;
expenditures. The credit will be disbursed against the categories in Table 2.5 (see Annex&#13;
12 for disbursement categories by each component and the estimated schedule).&#13;

2.42 Full documentation will be required for all contracts for equipment and works&#13;
valued at US$200,000 equivalent or more. Disbursements for equipment, works and&#13;
costs for implementation support valued at under US$200,000 would be made on the&#13;
basis of itemized Statements of Expenditure (SOE). The SOE limit for consultant&#13;
services would be US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. The records of&#13;
SOE-supported expenditures would be retained and made available to IDA supervision&#13;
missions and regularly audited by external auditors acceptable to IDA. For the&#13;
Sihanoukville component, the condition for disbursement is that average tariffs should&#13;
have been raised to a level that ensures the financial viability of SWSA.&#13;
2.43 To facilitate disbursement from the credit, PPWSA and SWSA/MIME will each&#13;
open and maintain an IDA Special Account in the National Bank of Cambodia authorized&#13;
for this purpose, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, including appropriate&#13;
protection against set-off, seizure or attachment. The accounts that cover the IDA share&#13;
of eligible expenditures in all disbursement categories would each have an authorized&#13;
allocation of US$700,000 and US$400,000 equivalent, for PPWSA and SWSA/MIME,&#13;
respectively, to be withdrawn from the IDA credit and deposited in the Special Account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Unless IDA agrees otherwise, the authorized allocation will be limited to the equivalent&#13;
of US$350,000 and US$200,000 for PPWSA and MIME, respectively, until disbursement&#13;
and outstanding commitments against the credit allocated to each component equal or&#13;
exceed the SDR equivalent of US$2 million. Applications to replenish the Account,&#13;
supported by appropriate documentation, would be submitted regularly (not less than&#13;
quarterly) or when the amount withdrawn equaled 30 percent of the initial deposit.&#13;
2.44  The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2002 and the closing date for&#13;
the credit would be December 31, 2002. The estimated disbursement schedule is based&#13;
on detailed project implementation schedules in various PIPs (as no Bank disbursement&#13;
profile exists for water supply projects in Cambodia, the comparison shows the Bank&#13;
Standard Disbursement Profile (1995) for water supply and sanitation projects in the East&#13;
Asia and Pacific Region').&#13;
F.   PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
2.45  As the project seeks to build institutional, financial and technical capacity in each&#13;
of the implementing agencies, no new project unit will be established. Instead, existing&#13;
structures in each agency will be strengthened to implement their respective components&#13;
with the help of consultants. In the case of Phnom Penh (see organization chart - Annex&#13;
10), PPWSA already has established a project management unit (PMU) under the&#13;
managing director, supported by three deputy directors and a team of qualified staff. The&#13;
PMU's primary responsibility is to implement three projects: the proposed IDA-financed&#13;
project, and the on-going ADB and Japan Government financed projects. In&#13;
Sihanoukville, SWSA will implement the project, with support from MIME's UPWS&#13;
(also see the organization chart in Annex 10).&#13;
2.46 The policy framework for the water and sanitation sector will be based on lessons&#13;
from the PPWSA and SWSA components and implemented by the Coordinating&#13;
Committee, with secretariat assistance from MIME (see para. 1.21). Additional back-up&#13;
support, if required, will be provided by the IDA-financed PMU/Financial Services Unit&#13;
in the Ministry of Economy and Finance, where local staff gained experience in project&#13;
implementation, including procurement, performance monitoring, and reporting to the&#13;
Bank, under the Emergency Rehabilitation Project. Details of the organization and&#13;
management of the project are in the project implementation plan, summarized in Annex&#13;
11.&#13;
The bulk of disbursements will take place through PPWSA, which has a better implementation capacity&#13;
than water utilities in provincial towns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
Supervision and Monitoring&#13;
2.47  Each agency has prepared a set of the performance monitoring indicators for its&#13;
respective components, which were agreed upon during negotiations (see Annex 13).&#13;
The key indicators cover each component's objectives, major activities and inputs&#13;
required, expected outputs, and results/impacts to be monitored during project&#13;
implementation. The implementing agencies will submit semi-annual and annual reports&#13;
to IDA on the progress of each component. A mid-term review would be carried out after&#13;
the project's second year, estimated to be in June 2000, in conjunction with the RGC, the&#13;
implementing agencies, and IDA. Its purpose will be to assess progress, particularly with&#13;
the policy framework component.&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
2.48 PPWSA and SWSA accounting, financial management, and cost control capacity&#13;
will be strengthened by the project with consultant support. The technical assistance&#13;
provided will help the two agencies accomplish their medium-term goal of establishing&#13;
commercial operations. Within nine months after the end of each fiscal year, the&#13;
implementing agencies will submit to IDA an auditor's report, management report and&#13;
audited financial statements for the Special Accounts, Project Accounts and SOEs for the&#13;
preceding calendar year, audited by an external auditor acceptable to IDA. The audit will&#13;
ensure that: (a) proper accounting and audit procedures were maintained by both&#13;
organizations throughout the year; (b) a sufficient flow of funds contributed to the&#13;
utilities' investment programs throughout the year; (c) the utilities' profit and loss&#13;
accounts fairly assess the year's trading results; (d) the balance sheet provides a fair&#13;
assessment of the current value of their assets and liabilities; and (e) both will be able to&#13;
meet their commitments over the ensuing year.&#13;
2.49 After PPWSA and Phnom Penh Municipality agree on the composition of&#13;
PPWSA's assets and liabilities, the latest balance sheets, and profit and loss accounts, it&#13;
will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA, financed under the credit.&#13;
The purpose will be to prepare a base assessment of the utility's financial position and&#13;
determine its capacity to meet commitments under the project. This audit will probably&#13;
necessitate a revaluation of the assets held by each organization. The same exercise will&#13;
be performed for SWSA.&#13;
2.50 During negotiations, the ROC agreed that by December 31, 1998, it would cause a&#13;
revaluation of the assets of PPWSA and SWSA to be carried out, along with the initial&#13;
audits of each entity. An understanding was reached that independent auditors will be&#13;
appointed for this purpose. Agreement was also reached that the RGC would monitor the&#13;
progress of the project according to the agreed performance indicators, and fiumish IDA&#13;
semi-annual progress reports.&#13;
&#13;

3. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
3.1   The financial analysis of the Project involved: (1) a review of PPWSA and&#13;
SWSA operations and (2) a review of the project and debt service of the two stand-alone&#13;
investment components. A fully integrated financial model was developed to support the&#13;
analyses, particularly for projecting and assessing financial outcomes. Emphasis was&#13;
given to ascertaining the adequacy of tariff levels in order to fully recover costs as well as&#13;
evaluating the ability of the water authorities to meet performance improvement targets.&#13;
Special attention was given to PPWSA's ability to achieve targets for reducing UFW.&#13;
3.2   The Phnom Penh component forms part of PPWSA's much larger program to&#13;
expand the supply and efficiently distribute water. Besides the proposed Bank-funded&#13;
project to renovate the Chruoy Chang War water treatment plant, the program involves&#13;
expanding and rehabilitating the transmission and distribution system in other parts of the&#13;
city as well as expanding the Chamcar Mom and Phum Prek water treatment plants.&#13;
Financing for these investments have, or are currently being, finalized with the ADB, the&#13;
Japanese agency JICA, and French aid agencies. Altogether, investments are estimated to&#13;
be US$120 million, for the 1996-2002 period.&#13;
3.3   Because of the close relationship of these other projects and their benefits to the&#13;
project proposed by PPWSA, the financial assessment focused on the combined returns&#13;
of the entire investment program by including all the estimated costs, assumed debt and&#13;
expected returns in order to evaluate the financial and economic attractiveness of the&#13;
planned investments as well as PPWSA's ability to meet current and future debt servicing&#13;
requirements. Compared to the Phnom Penh component, the Sihanoukville component is&#13;
relatively small and does not rely on the implementation of other projects to achieve its&#13;
expected benefits; however, the component is significant, as it will help improve public&#13;
health and general living standards, and increase industrial output.&#13;
B.   OVERVIEW OF CURRENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
3.4   Financial and operating highlights for 1996 for PPWSA and SWSA are as&#13;
follows:&#13;

3.5    Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority. PPWSA follows conventional accrual&#13;
accounting principles. Standard commercial procedures are applied for the accounting of&#13;
revenues and expenses as well as fixed assets and debt obligations. PPWSA has&#13;
computerized most of its accounting, including the general ledger, billings and&#13;
receivables; however, the balance sheet opening positions for the new autonomous&#13;
corporation have not yet been finalized pending the reconciliation of the inter-&#13;
governmental trade accounts such as trade receivables and payables and outstanding debt.&#13;
While some of the debt may be affected by the reconciliation, it is not anticipated to have&#13;
a material effect on the financial assessment.&#13;
3.6    PPWSA past profit performance has been poor, due to high levels of UFW and&#13;
inadequate tariffs. For 1997, the Authority is estimating a net loss of approximately Riels&#13;
724 million (US$200,000 equivalent) on revenues of Riels 13.5 billion. However, total&#13;
cash flow was positive before depreciation charges. Electricity, maintenance and labor&#13;
charges combined made up almost 50 percent of estimated expenses for 1997, while&#13;
chemicals accounted for only 5.9 percent. This operating performance is a significant&#13;
improvement over 1996, when losses were about $2.0 million; in 1998, it is expected to&#13;
improve significantly with the introduction of new tariffs designed to recover all costs.&#13;
PPWSA's unaudited financial statements for December 31, 1996 are presented in Annex&#13;
15.&#13;
3.7    PPWSA's corporatized opening balance sheet position is relatively strong, with&#13;
minimal debt to the total level of assets. Total equity at Riels 251 billion comprises&#13;
approximately 95 percent of total assets, yielding a debt-to-equity ratio substantially less&#13;
than 1. However, it has experienced difficulties in managing its working capital. For&#13;
example, inventories, liquid funds and receivables are excessive as are the accounts&#13;
payable, particularly to the power supplier, Electricite' de Cambodge. Payments to other&#13;
government agencies are also being delayed. These practices have developed partly from&#13;
I Figures are for 10 months in 1997. Asset, debt and capital balances are for 1996.&#13;
2 Fixed assets were revalued in 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
the utility's lack of financial autonomy, and the related uncertainties of not having full&#13;
control of its financial flows. Now that it has gained corporate autonomy, PPWSA&#13;
management assures that commercial practices will be strictly followed, including prompt&#13;
disconnection of delinquent accounts.&#13;
3.8  Its other major operating obstacle stems from UFW, which historically has been&#13;
as high as 80 percent, one of the poorest records in the region. However, during the past&#13;
few years, it has made impressive gains by introducing an intensive program to reduce&#13;
these losses (see Annex 1): Technical and commercial losses have dropped to&#13;
approximately 57 percent. Much higher gains have been demonstrated in PPWSA pilot&#13;
areas and even more are expected in the near future, as new investments to rehabilitate&#13;
the distribution network, financed by the ADB and Japan, come on-streamn. Technical&#13;
assistance is also being made available through existing donor programs and by the&#13;
proposed project to further strengthen accounting, financial management and commercial&#13;
practices through metering and improved billings and collections.&#13;
3.9   Sihanoukville Water Supply Authority.  SWSA's operational performance is&#13;
similar to that of PPWSA's, although it is a much smaller and more manageable system.&#13;
It is expected to incur a net loss in 1997 despite breaking even on a cash flow basis in&#13;
1996, as tariffs have not been sufficient to recover depreciation charges. However, tariffs&#13;
were raised to ensure full cost recovery as well as meet projected debt servicing&#13;
requirements. Water losses have been kept at respectable levels, averaging about 28&#13;
percent or less. Unaudited financial statements for the SWSA for 1996 are summarized in&#13;
Annex 15.&#13;
3.10 In 1996, fuel and electricity made up 76 percent of expenses, while labor&#13;
accounted for 4 percent. Like PPWSA, SWSA holds an excessive level of working&#13;
capital, particularly in inventories. Also, it delays its payments to suppliers, which&#13;
produces an account that is almost twice that of its receivables. Its balance sheet position&#13;
is sound, with no long-term debt on the books; however, its equity position, at $300,000,&#13;
particularly the retained earnings, are greatly overstated, since depreciation charges have&#13;
not been counted. Its fixed assets could be revalued, based on current prices. While this&#13;
would substantially increase SWSA's total value, it would also place added pressure on&#13;
management to achieve returns on a more realistically valued asset base. Given the lack&#13;
of completeness of SWSA's accounts, its management has assured the Bank it will assess&#13;
its assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1997 no latter than December 31, 1998 in&#13;
order to ensure more reliable opening positions. These findings will then be used to&#13;
monitor project and financial performance targets during project implementation.&#13;
C.   FuTuRE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
3.11  Financial projections for both components for the 10-year period 1998-2007 are&#13;
presented in Annex 16 along with a description of the underlying assumptions and input&#13;
variables. Summaries of projected financial and operating performance for PPWSA and&#13;
SWSA are presented below:&#13;

3.12   PPWSA is likely to experience two critical periods in terms of its future finances&#13;
during project implementation. The first will probably surface in 1998 and 1999,&#13;
immediately after construction begins; the second will probably arise in 2003, once the&#13;
project is completed and placed in service. In that year, the projected debt service is&#13;
estimated to reach its highest levels--about Riels 20.5 billion on projected revenues of&#13;
Riels 43.7 billion. During 1998-1999, the utility will experience significant pressure to&#13;
produce enough counterpart funding through internal cash generation, so as to sustain its&#13;
sizable investment program. By contrast, in 2003, the full force of depreciation charges&#13;
from new investments, in addition to the debt service requirements, will affect the&#13;
utility's income and cash flow, and seriously challenge its capacity to steer through the&#13;
financial obstacles. Thus, its future finances will depend on its ability to: (a) maintain&#13;
adequate tariffs; (b) realize performance targets for reducing water losses from the current&#13;
57 percent to about 40 percent, by 2003; and (c) impose strict controls on discretionary&#13;
spending so the operating ratio can gradually improve as the revenue base expands.&#13;
3.13   With respect to water losses, significant improvements are anticipated as the ADB&#13;
project to rehabilitate the distribution network proceeds. Conversely, tariff levels must&#13;
remain positive vis-a-vis expected inflationary pressures and, lacking an independent&#13;
regulatory institution, the Government has assured the Bank that a proper and&#13;
depoliticized mechanism will be developed to ensure their adequacy in the future. In&#13;
addition, PPWSA management has assured the Bank it will try to maintain the following&#13;
financial targets during the five-year investment program: (a) an operating ratio of 50&#13;
percent or less; (b) a debt service coverage ratio of 1.3 times or better, beginning in&#13;
2003; and (c) an average collection period not exceeding 120 days, up to December 31,&#13;
1998, and not exceeding 80 days thereafter&#13;
3 A debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0 times equates to a capital structure of 50% to 50% equity. Accordingly, a&#13;
capital structure of 75% debt to 25% equity equates to a.debt/equity ratio of 3 times.&#13;

3.14 SWSA's finances are projected to be more manageable, both during construction&#13;
and once debt service begins on the proposed credit. Partly, this is due to the more&#13;
lenient lending terms provided to SWSA. Still, the project is large when compared to&#13;
SWSA's total capitalization; thus, the credit will place added pressure on SWSA&#13;
management to maintain adequate tariffs and control operating costs. In addition, its debt&#13;
will increase significantly, particularly in 1999 and 2000, in the early construction period,&#13;
when its capitalization will essentially be all debt.&#13;
3.15   Since SWSA is a unit of MIME and not yet corporatized or autonomous, the&#13;
project is designed as a pilot, both for it and other provincial water authorities, to test&#13;
management's capacity to operate as if it were. Accordingly, the Government and SWSA&#13;
agreed to adopt commercial financial performance targets during the implementation of&#13;
the credit, as practice for bringing the organization closer to a financially autonomous&#13;
status. The agreed targets are: (a) an operating ratio (excluding depreciation and interest&#13;
charges) of 60 percent or less; (b) a collection performance of not less than 90 percent; (c)&#13;
an average collection period of 60 days or less; and (d) a current ratio of 2:1 or better.&#13;
3.16   Given the financial parameters adopted by PPWSA and SWSA and the&#13;
performance targets agreed with the Bank, both organizations are expected to record&#13;
respectable financial returns on their proposed investments, with calculated financial rates&#13;
of return of 13.6 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
4. PROJECT BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A.   PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
Non quantifiable benefits&#13;
4.1   One of the main goals of a water supply project is to improve public health and&#13;
well-being. Among the most affected by the project will be the poorest, most marginal&#13;
and vulnerable segments of the population. These are usually women and children, as&#13;
well as transients and urban squatters who illegally occupy peri-urban areas without&#13;
public services or live on public land, structures, apartment rooftops, drainage canals,&#13;
embankments, and boengs. Because water is unavailable, they often purchase small&#13;
amounts from those with water connections or from vendors. They also rely on polluted&#13;
streams, rivers and wells to draw water for washing and bathing and are routinely&#13;
exposed to health and environmental hazards brought about because of a lack of drainage&#13;
and sanitation.&#13;
4.2   The impact of contaminated water is profound, as revealed by hospital morbidity&#13;
reports. Health problems include not just the diseases associated with lack of clean water,&#13;
such as gastro-intestinal or infectious diseases, but also dengue fever and malaria, which&#13;
are widespread due to water storage practices. Infants and children are particularly&#13;
affected, since exposure to contaminated water has led to one of the highest infant&#13;
morbidity and mortality rates in the world; gastro-intestinal and infectious skin diseases&#13;
are problems that can be alleviated by improving the quality of and access to water.&#13;
Thus, the project will target areas where the poor can benefit the most: schools, hospitals,&#13;
and squatter settlement areas, through communal water selling points. For example,&#13;
several Sihanoukville schools have no running water for either drinking or sanitation. A&#13;
hospital and an orphanage also lack water supply services, and rely on untreated water&#13;
supplied by tankers.&#13;
4.3  In Phnom Penh, the price of water privately supplied by water tankers and&#13;
individuals is estimated to be 10 times PPWSA charges, according to a recent ADB&#13;
survey. In Sihanoukville and other provincial towns, price differentials are even higher.&#13;
Socio-economic studies reveal that households have an estimated average monthly&#13;
income of only US$23, but spend as much as 73 percent on water purchases.' Thus, the&#13;
'There are no reliable estimates of employment generation in the informal sector, although it appears to be&#13;
substantial.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
project will markedly lower their costs, because water will be supplied by the utilities&#13;
(see Annex 1 on commercial practices in the water supply sector).&#13;
4.4   As primary health and food providers for their household, women will benefit&#13;
from an improved water supply because it will facilitate better hygiene, food preparation,&#13;
and general cleanliness, at home and in the surrounding environment. Apart from the cost&#13;
savings, women will also gain through time-savings associated with procuring water.&#13;
4.5   Poor drinking water quality is a particularly serious problem in Phnom Penh,&#13;
where many supply lines are old and allow treated water to be contaminated. Problems&#13;
are severe in Sihanoukville as well, where many residents dig shallow wells that are&#13;
contaminated by septage leached through the soil.&#13;
4.6   Another major non-quantifiable benefit will be the project's TA impact on&#13;
Camnbodian water utilities. PPWSA has already generated impressive capacity to&#13;
understand and grapple with the technical and management problems associated with&#13;
large water systems, but the project will offer its personnel additional exposure to a well-&#13;
run, commercial utility. Thus, the investment program will demonstrate that water&#13;
utilities can be transformed into commercial entities that respond to consumer needs,&#13;
preferences and willingness to pay. Depending on the experience gained in Phnom Penh&#13;
and Sihanoukville, the component will probably be replicated in other towns.&#13;
Quantifiable Benefits&#13;
4.7   The benefits described in the above paragraphs are substantial, although difficult&#13;
to quantify and therefore not included in this analysis. However, even excluding them,&#13;
the other economic benefits in both cities will be large. In Phnom Penh, revenue&#13;
producing water is estimated to increase from about 14.9 million cubic meters a year in&#13;
1997 to 39.3 million cubic meters in 2002, through this and related projects. Total legal&#13;
connections are expected to more than double, from about 39,000 to 90,000 by 2002, and&#13;
water supplied to existing connections will be more reliable, both in terms of supply and&#13;
quality. To improve access to the poor, it has included a pilot to finance domestic&#13;
connections.&#13;
4.8   In Sihanoukville, the total available water is expected to increase from 0.58&#13;
million cubic meters a year to 1.77 million cubic meters by 2002, while connections will&#13;
nearly triple, from 886 to over 2,300. As in Phnom Penh, the Sihanoukville component&#13;
will make water supply more reliable in terms of availability and quality. To ensure that&#13;
those not connected to the system have access, the project will construct water selling&#13;
points in low income neighborhoods.'&#13;
2The water selling points will be located through a process of community consultations, and managed&#13;
through lease or management contracts in 20 locations, and will serve about 2,800 persons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
4.9    The quantifiable benefits from the project arise from domestic consumption, as&#13;
well as industrial and commercial consumption. No attempt has been made to value&#13;
externalities or non-quantifiable benefits, such as public health improvements (though&#13;
these are very substantial) or increased land values for areas covered by piped water.&#13;
4.10   Quantification of benefits was handicapped by the lack of reliable data. Only one&#13;
source of data on willingness to pay was available--a study conducted for the ADB by&#13;
consultants--which does not cover industrial consumers. The benefit valuation took into&#13;
account the results of the survey and used information gathered from a recent ADB&#13;
publication (Asian Water Utilities Handbook, 1997). Data were also gathered informally&#13;
through discussions with PPWSA and the community on water vending practices by the&#13;
informal sector.&#13;
4.11   Benefits from the project through higher domestic consumption arise from&#13;
resource cost savings and the incremental consumer surplus. For the Phnom Penh&#13;
component, the resource cost savings is the difference between the cost of water to&#13;
PPWSA and that of privately vended water (including private wells). Using a figure of&#13;
$0.67 per cubic meter, the resource cost saving was calculated to be $0.49 per cubic&#13;
meter.3 The incremental consumer surplus is estimated at 10 percent of this benefit.&#13;
4.12 In Sihanoukville, domestic consumption was broken down into consumption from&#13;
the reticulation system, water vendors, and the 20 new water selling points to be financed&#13;
by the project. Water resource savings were applied to the additional water piped through&#13;
the reticulation network and from that sold at the water selling points. The cost of&#13;
privately vended water was estimated at US$0.824 per cubic meter, which provided a&#13;
resource cost saving of US$0.56.&#13;
4.13   While the general equilibrium effects of improved water supply on the industrial&#13;
and commercial sectors are substantially positive, they are difficult to quantify, given the&#13;
absence of even rudimentary data. However, these consumers would obviously not&#13;
purchase water unless the incremental revenue was at least equal to the price. From this&#13;
price, the cost to PPWSA/SWSA is then deducted. An additional amount of consumer&#13;
surplus is still not captured by the price, since anecdotal evidence points to industries&#13;
paying far more than even the enlarged PPWSA tariff--which indicates the surplus is&#13;
large. Evidence also suggests that industry and business start-ups have been retarded by&#13;
the lack of reliable piped water. Thus, the approach adopted was to avoid sophisticated&#13;
3The price of vended water is reported in the Asian Water Utilities Handbook (1997) to be $1.67 per cu.m.&#13;
in Phnom Penh. Table A 1.4 in Annex I provides consumption pattern data for Phnom Penh, and this&#13;
was used as a basis for calculating the "without project cost" of water ($0.67).&#13;
4Lack of data from Sihanoukville precluded an analysis similar to that for Phnom Penh. For the latter, it&#13;
was estimated that 62% of vended and water supplied from rivers and wells was collected by&#13;
consumers without charge. Because Sihanoukville has fewer fresh water sources close to the urban&#13;
area compared to Phnom Penh, the ratio was reduced to 50%. The price of vended water was assumed&#13;
to be $1.64 per cu. m., though anecdotal evidence suggests it is closer to $2.0 cu. m. An overall&#13;
average price for Sihanoukville for vended water was calculated on this basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
analyses and instead use the commercial tariff per cubic meter as a proxy for overall&#13;
benefits; this method almost certainly undervalues the benefits.&#13;
4.14  The aggregate benefit was calculated by applying the unit benefit per cubic meter&#13;
to: (a) the volume of water consumption diverted from the higher cost supplier (vendor)&#13;
to the lower cost supplier( PPWSA/ SWSA) and (b) the volume of increase in overall&#13;
supply due to improved distribution (by reducing UFW).&#13;
B.   PROJECT COSTS&#13;
4.15  Project costs, described in the financial analysis section, were transferred to the&#13;
economic analysis, and conversion factors applied. To determine incremental capital&#13;
costs, the analysis used a standard conversion factor of 90 percent. For operations and&#13;
maintenance costs, a conversion factor of 75 percent was used for salaries and wages,&#13;
given the high level of unemployment in Cambodia. Electricity and chemicals were&#13;
shadow-priced at 90 percent, to reflect the labor content, maintenance was shadow-priced&#13;
at 80 percent of the financial price, given the relatively high labor needed to maintain&#13;
production and distribution systems, and connecting consumers to the delivery network&#13;
was shadow priced at 80 percent, also to reflect the high labor content.&#13;
C.   OTHER ASSUMPTIONS&#13;
4.16 Project analysis. Three analyses were made: one each for Phnom Penh,&#13;
Sihanoukville, and the overall project.&#13;
4.17 Project life. The project was evaluated over 25 years.&#13;
4.18  Replacement costs. Post-project replacement costs for the production and&#13;
distribution systems were included.&#13;
4.19 Capital costs. The opportunity cost of capital used was 10 percent.&#13;
4.20 Residual values. No residual values were added at the end of the project's&#13;
economic life.&#13;
4.21  Contingencies. Physical contingencies of 15 percent were applied to civil&#13;
works, mechanical and electrical works and installation, computing equipment and&#13;
materials. Price contingencies were excluded as were duties and taxes.&#13;
4.22  National costs. Costs for the national training center, a study on Sihanoukville's&#13;
future water needs, a study on sanitation and wastewater, and project coordination were&#13;
not included in either the Phnom Penh or Sihanoukville component. Instead, US$2.3&#13;
million were included in the overall project assessment for these items.&#13;
4.23  Other costs.  As noted elsewhere, the ADB launched a US$14.6 million water&#13;
transmission and distribution project in other geographic sections of Phnom Penh. Thus,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
this capital input had to be included in the analysis (see Annex 18 for tables to support the&#13;
economic analysis).&#13;

E.   ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS&#13;
4.24 The proposed project was rated a "B" as there are no major environmental&#13;
problems. The principal environmental irnpact is the larger volume of sewage the&#13;
increased water supply will generate. In Phnom Penh, sewage outfalls discharge into the&#13;
Tonle Sap river and a nearby lake. The project includes a study on sanitation policy that&#13;
will guide investments in Phnom Penh and the provincial cities; the recommendations&#13;
would be included in an investment program prepared under the project for future&#13;
funding. In Sihanoukville, the proposed water system includes environmental mitigation&#13;
measures for the weir design, reservoir expansion, and alum sludge disposal.&#13;
4.25  In Phnom Penh, the only direct social impact of the project is the displacement&#13;
and resettlement of 26 households (144 people) living at the site of the Chrouy Chang&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
War treatment plant that belongs to PPWSA. These are retired and current employees of&#13;
PPWSA, as well as 18 households of illegal immigrants. The utility had allowed them to&#13;
live here because the plant was not operating and PPWSA did not need the land.&#13;
Regardless of tenure issues, PPWSA prepared a Land Acquisition, Compensation and&#13;
Rehabilitation Plan according to Bank policy (OD 4.30); eventually, many of its&#13;
provisions were not needed, because the families opted for cash compensation. To ensure&#13;
that all provisions were met, the Bank suggested and PPWSA agreed that prior to&#13;
appraisal, an independent external agency evaluate the manner and transparency of the&#13;
compensation, and the current conditions of the resettled residents. Based on this&#13;
assessment, which was done in February 1997, all seemed to be in order and no further&#13;
action is expected by PPWSA. In Sihanoukville, the component was designed so as to&#13;
avoid resettlement at the present time. If any is needed later, it would be in connection&#13;
with part of one well, and Sihanoukville authorities would acquire it directly from the&#13;
owner.&#13;
F.    PROJECT RISKS&#13;
Financial risks&#13;
4.26 The main financial risks would arise if PPWSA cannot achieve the agreed&#13;
operational targets.&#13;
a) Reducing UFW. As explained in the financial analysis, UFW bears heavily&#13;
on the project's viability, reducing it is a complex multi-disciplinary effort&#13;
(even in the best circumstances), and success cannot be taken for granted.&#13;
However, the target of 40 percent is not overly ambitious, as it is still above&#13;
the average for developing countries (37 percent) in the Bank's Water and&#13;
Wastewater Utilities Indicators sample study. The project design would&#13;
mitigate these risks by introducing the proposed technical assistance&#13;
immediately after credit effectiveness, which would include the twinning&#13;
arrangement.&#13;
b) Raising tariffs. Between the time the project was appraised and negotiated,&#13;
estimates of inflation and depreciation of the Riel against the dollar changed&#13;
significantly because of the region's macroeconomics crisis. Thus, the&#13;
project's financial sustainability will depend on how quickly water tariffs in&#13;
PPWSA and SWSA are adjusted to cover the increased operating costs. The&#13;
risk will be mitigated by an annual review of tariffs during IDA supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
c) Achieving a mix of commercial and domestic consumption. The financial&#13;
analysis assumed that when the expansion is complete, the shares of overall&#13;
consumption will change: Domestic consumption will rise; commercial&#13;
consumption will decline, from the current 45 percent to 38 percent.&#13;
However, commercial consumption will rise in the aggregate, by 8 percent,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
which is critical to the utility's financial viability. Thus, the long-term risk&#13;
does not appear large.&#13;
d) Increasing the number of revenue-earning connections. Connection costs&#13;
continue to be high relative to per capita income, and experience elsewhere&#13;
indicates that this often prevents poor and middle class consumers from&#13;
becoming connected. This risk will be mitigated by the pilot scheme of&#13;
assistance to domestic consumers to finance connection fees.&#13;
Political and other risks&#13;
4.27 Cambodia depends on donor support for a considerable part of its budget. Thus,&#13;
reduced donor support has severely reduced resources for counterpart funding. In the&#13;
case of the major component, to be implemented by PPWSA, it is expected the water&#13;
utility will generate enough funds internally to meet not only its counterpart fund&#13;
requirements, but those of the entire project. This would reduce the burden on the&#13;
national budget and limit the government's "contribution" to taxes and duties exemptions.&#13;
However, the risk is serious. Thus, during negotiations, assurances were obtained from&#13;
the Ministry of Economy and Finance that in the event PPWSA experiences financial&#13;
difficulties and cannot meet its counterpart funding obligations, it will earmark the&#13;
required counterpart funds from the Government budget.&#13;
428  Political risks remain that could reduce the Government's ability to develop the&#13;
sector policies and introduce the required institutional reforms. These risks are mitigated&#13;
by three factors. First, the policy making process will be developed in a participative&#13;
manner, involving key stakeholders (consumers, utility employees, key political and&#13;
official representatives). The Government has already signaled its conmnitment by&#13;
forming an inter-ministerial Coordinating Committee to develop a comprehensive and&#13;
long-term national policy for water and sanitation services, and to streamline its functions&#13;
in the sector. Second, the project's approach to policy and institutional development is&#13;
based on learning by doing, which means lessons can be quickly incorporated,&#13;
adaptations can be made according to changed economic and political conditions, and the&#13;
design reworked, if necessary. Third, a series of seminars have been proposed, organized&#13;
by the Bank's Economic Development Institute (EDI), to inform stakeholders about the&#13;
benefits of early action and the costs of inaction.&#13;
4.29 The lack of staff with experience in externally funded projects is a concern. As&#13;
this is the first project for the agencies, the risk is that, without enough technical&#13;
assistance, problems could arise: For example, at the early stages, the agencies' lack of&#13;
familiarity with Bank procedures could slow procurement and general project&#13;
implementation. For these reasons, the project will provide capacity building, technical&#13;
assistance and staff training, especially at the beginning&#13;
4.30 Finally, the only risk that could not be reduced through careful preparation was&#13;
that related to security and the unstable political situation. To mitigate this, activities have&#13;
been limited to the two major urban areas, which are less likely to be affected.&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;
CAMBODIA&#13;
URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
COMMERCIAL PRACTICES&#13;
IN THE CAMBODIAN WATER SUPPLY SECTOR&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Previous investments in the water supply sector have focused on rehabilitating&#13;
physical works, on training and on improving cost-recovery. This has built up a core team&#13;
of staff in PPWSA and in SWSA, although there are still major deficiencies in institutional&#13;
capacity. The focus on cost recovery needs to continue, but there is now a need to&#13;
commercialize sector institutions, and increase their accountability to service consumers.&#13;
2.    Past accomplishments have been fairly significant: utilities in both Phnom Penh and&#13;
Sihanoukville have made substantial progress both in expanding service coverage and in&#13;
managing their services more efficiently. However, there is still considerable room for&#13;
improvement, indicated by the continued high rate of unaccounted for water (UFW) in&#13;
PPWSA.&#13;
Unaccounted for water&#13;
3.    While unaccounted for water (UFW) is currently running at about 57% in Phnom&#13;
Penh, it has registered consistent declines from 1992 onward: from 80% in 1992 to 73%&#13;
in 1993, 64.5% in 1994, 64.2% in 1995, and 61% in 1996. UFW figures at even the&#13;
existing levels indicate that PPWSA operations have substantial room for improvements.&#13;
4.    The significance of the scale of UFW can be demonstrated by the fact that of the&#13;
total capacity of about 110,000 cubic meters of the two Phnom Penh water treatment&#13;
plants daily, in 1996 only about 41,000 cubic meters was paid for, even though PPWSA&#13;
has incurred the expenditure to produce and distribute a total of about 105,000 cubic&#13;
meters. Because of the financial strains placed on PPWSA resulting from the UFW&#13;
problem, increases in water tariffs are not able to cover costs. For example, an average&#13;
tariffs of KR 800 per cubic meter with the current rate of UFW is equivalent to only KR&#13;
310 per cubic meter at zero UFW to retain the same income base.&#13;
5.    UFW and its associated costs take on fuirther dimensions when new investment&#13;
programs are implemented. For example, with the proposed PPWSA investment program&#13;
Approximately $45 million will be spent to increase production capacity to 175,000 cubic&#13;
meters per day, improve the transmission and distribution network. If the levels of UFW&#13;
were 60%, this means the total investment for the improvement of the network would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
about $640 per cubic meter distributed per day. If UFW were zero the capital cost per&#13;
cubic meter delivered per day would be lowered to $260.&#13;
6.    PPWSA recognizes the significance of the UFW problem and included a major&#13;
section on the problem in its five year development plan (1996 to 2000) dated April 1996.&#13;
PPWSA identified the following reasons for its high level of UFW:&#13;
*  The distribution network has a high rate of technical losses due to age and lack of&#13;
maintenance;&#13;
*  The customer file has not been kept up-to-date;&#13;
*  All connections were not metered, and many meters were defective;&#13;
*  Billing by flat rate used a rate which is below the actual quantity taken;&#13;
-  Consumers took advantage of the chaotic situation a few years back to invest in illegal&#13;
connections;&#13;
-  Supply from public wells managed by PPWSA was free;&#13;
-  Some connections (notably Government employees and organizations) were not billed,&#13;
and&#13;
3  Squatters in low income settlements refused to pay on the grounds that they were too&#13;
poor (although they continued t pay exorbitant prices for vended water)&#13;
7.    PPWSA has undertaken a two-pronged strategy to tackle the problem of UFW;&#13;
both of which will receive support from the project. One part of the strategy is to utilize&#13;
donor assistance to finance a comprehensive program of general network rehabilitation&#13;
(i.e. pipe replacement and pipe renovation) in all the districts of Phnom Penh. IDA,&#13;
together with ADB, Governments of Japan and France are financing a combined program&#13;
that covers the whole city. The other part of the strategy is to launch a water loss control&#13;
program aimed at understanding and controlling the high water losses at the retail&#13;
(consumer) level. The latter program was launched in 1996 with French bilateral&#13;
assistance, and has intensively investigated in a pilot zone - suitably isolated from the rest&#13;
of the distribution system - the reasons why UFW is so high. The investigations revealed&#13;
that losses were caused by a variety of factors, both technical and non-technical. Among&#13;
the technical factors were poor quality of pipes, fittings and jointing, heavy traffic above&#13;
areas where water pipes had been laid, and deterioration of the water mains. Among the&#13;
non-technical factors were unauthorized practices by consumers, such as illegal&#13;
connections to the distribution system, broken and missing water meters, presence of a&#13;
number of unmetered public underground tanks from which water was consumed without&#13;
payment, and non-payment of dues by public agencies.&#13;
On the non-technical side (i.e. financial and accounting) PPWSA program now includes:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
*  Increasing the per capita consumption billing base for flat rate bills;&#13;
*  Completing the registration of all customers on to the computerized billing system and&#13;
deleting disused accounts;&#13;
*  Instituting an incentive scheme and procedures for PPWSA staff, collection personnel&#13;
and meter and pipe connection teams to eliminate illegal connections,&#13;
*  A major program to increase the number of metered connections (in 1993 there were&#13;
3,391 metered connections and at the end of November 1997 this had increased to&#13;
about 39,000 out of a total of 41,735 connections);, and&#13;
*  Phasing out of public underground tanks and public wells'.&#13;
Progress to date in PPWSA&#13;
8.    The program for general network rehabilitation has been recently completed for&#13;
the Dom Penh District of Phnom Penh, with assistance from the Government of France.&#13;
The results have been quite dramatic: the monthly volume of water billed in the Dom Penh&#13;
District appears to have increased significantly. In the December 1995 quarter the average&#13;
volume of water billed was about 300,000 cubic meters per month. For the two months&#13;
July and August 1996 the average was 450,000 cubic meters per month. Water usage in&#13;
July and August could be expected to be higher than the period October to December&#13;
because the latter is the rainy season and tail of the rainy season. Nevertheless, the data&#13;
does suggest that progress has been made even though there is no macro meter data to&#13;
confirm this assertion. Data from PPWSA also shows that the number of flat rate bills as a&#13;
portion of total billed water has declined over the period January/February 1995 to&#13;
July/August 1996. This decline, in addition to the increase in volume of billed metered&#13;
water, suggests that users who were billed on a flat rate basis were consuming more than&#13;
was allowed in the flat rate charge.&#13;
9.    The issue of UFW has been discussed at length with PPWSA, and senior&#13;
management is aware that UFW can undermine the viability of this project and the&#13;
autonomy recently vested by RGC. PPWSA expects to gain significant benefits by&#13;
expanding the pilot water loss control program through the IDA credit. The twinning&#13;
arrangement with an Australian water utility is also expected to help maintain the&#13;
momentum of the UFW program..&#13;
10.   As noted above, UFW is the key to financial and economic viability. Because of&#13;
the effort that is being put into the reduction of the problem, the financial analysis has&#13;
It should be noted that as of October 1996, there were 1,945 public wells served by PPWSA with each&#13;
well used by at least 20 families. It is estimated that approximately 10 cubic meters of water is&#13;
extracted each day from each well which equates to about 19,450 cubic meters per day or about 20%&#13;
of current plant output. Policing of wells is a difficult task, and PPWSA is attempting to develop&#13;
neighborhood water selling points, to be managed locally by communities through cost recovery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
assumed that UFW will fall from 57% in 1997 to 40% by 2002. In view of the magnitude&#13;
of the problem in Phnom Penh, and the Bank's experience with similar projects in other&#13;
countries and UFW in other developing countries, it is perhaps unrealistic to project a&#13;
much greater improvement in the rates.&#13;
Revenue collection efficiency&#13;
11.   PPWSA has undertaken a vigorous program to improve cost recovery. In 1992&#13;
and 1993, the authority's receipts were less than half of its operating expenses; however&#13;
by 1995, receipts exceeded expenses by 30%. To achieve this, the PPWSA acted&#13;
simultaneously on several fronts. First, in revamping its customer list, PPWSA found that&#13;
almost 60% of those on the 1993 database did not correspond to actual customers. It has&#13;
now established an accurate database by eliminating files of non-existent customers and&#13;
removing duplicate entries. This initiative initially led to a decline in the total number of&#13;
registered connections, but as illegal connections were cut and new customers registered,&#13;
the number began to increase.&#13;
12.   Second, PPWSA embarked on an aggressive metering campaign to ensure that&#13;
bills sent .out correspond more closely to the amount of water each customer uses. This&#13;
program has led to a dramatic increase in the proportion of metered connections from only&#13;
13% in 1993 to 55% in 1995 and 81% as of September 1996.&#13;
13.   Third, with a fully computerized customer database and billing system, excessive&#13;
delays in tariff collections have been reduced. Collection ratios have increased from 41%&#13;
in 1993, to 51% in 1994, 61% in 1995 and 93% in 1996. Collection ratios are high for all&#13;
classes of customer except for public institutions. Data from different consumer groups&#13;
shows that the collection ratio from domestic and commercial consumers is about 100%.&#13;
However, the major problem is amounts owing from public institutions. In the May 1 to&#13;
June 30 data, these institutions had paid only 15% of outstanding accounts. During this&#13;
period public institutions accounted for about 6% of total billed consumption.&#13;
14.   Even though PPWSA's collection ratio appears in order, an analysis of debtors&#13;
shows that the average collection period exceeds the periods indicated by the collection&#13;
ratio. The debtors' data shows that PPWSA's debtors owe PPWSA about four times&#13;
average monthly sales. This means that, on average, it takes about four months to collect&#13;
sales revenue. The worst customers are the public institutions which owe about 12 times&#13;
their average monthly consumption.&#13;
15.   PPWSA has made considerable progress with the establishment of its&#13;
computerized billing and accounting system. The billing system uses the Aquarius system&#13;
which is based on the Orac,i application and it produces all bills (about 30,000) for all&#13;
PPWSA metered and unmetered customers as well as a range of management reports.&#13;
The system was installed at PPWSA in late 1994 and it was developed in France. PPWSA&#13;
has had considerable help from both the French Government and the UNDP/World Bank&#13;
project in the accounting field. Electricite de Cambodge does not have a computerized&#13;
billing system and would appear to be several years behind PPWSA on this aspect of its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
operation. In addition to Aquarius, PPWSA also runs the Accpac 2000 system for general&#13;
accounting purposes. The major problem is that the two systems cannot be integrated.&#13;
This issue, and other financial accounting issues, will be addressed as part of the Policy&#13;
Framework component of the project.&#13;
16.   During appraisal PPWSA acknowledged the problem associated with length of the&#13;
average coliection period. It was agreed that PPWSA would develop a plan and institute&#13;
procedures to recoup the outstanding accounts prior to project effectiveness.&#13;
Tariffs&#13;
Phnom Penh&#13;
17.   Prior to September 1993 the tariff for all consumers in Phnom Penh was KR166&#13;
per cubic meter of water. In September 1993 the rate for commercial users was increased&#13;
to KR 515 per cubic meter. Rates were increased again in November 1993 and again in&#13;
July 1994 when domestic rates were set at KR 250 per cubic meter and KR 700 for&#13;
commercial users and some wholesalers.&#13;
18.   In a report commissioned by the Asian Development Bank, the Consultants,&#13;
Sogreah Ingenierie, determined that the cost of producing water in 1996 was $0.44 per&#13;
cubic meter or KR 1144 at an exchange rate of $1=KR 2600. This was significantly&#13;
higher than the existing tariff of $0.10 for domestic users and $0.27 for commercial users&#13;
per cubic meter.&#13;
19.   The Draft Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Economy and&#13;
Finance and the Municipality of Phnom Penh and the Asian Development Bank Fact&#13;
Finding Mission of May 1996 identified the critical nature of the water tariffs problem and&#13;
the need of cost recovery. The Draft Memorandum concluded that the financial&#13;
performance targets set for PPWSA are to recover operating and maintenance (O&amp;M)&#13;
costs including depreciation by 2000 and to recover O&amp;M plus debt service expenses by&#13;
2005. Sogreah's analysis suggests that to achieve these targets the average tariff would&#13;
need to be increased to KR 1,100 per cubic meter. New tariffs adopted have consequently&#13;
been progressive. These will encourage water conservation and allow cross subsidies&#13;
from high consumption users to low consumption users and from commercial and&#13;
industrial users to domestic users.&#13;
20.   In the Loan Agreement between the Government of Cambodia and the ADB, the&#13;
Borrower and PPWSA agreed to implement the new tariff structure and to reduce the&#13;
water connection fee by half The new tariff schedule, implemented in June 1997 is shown&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

a For consumption greater than 10,000&#13;
M3/month, a 10% discount will be applied&#13;
21.   The new tariff schedule was utilized in the financial projections for PPWSA.&#13;
However, since June 1997, the changed macroeconomic scenario in Cambodia, and in the&#13;
rest of the East Asia region necessitates a periodic review of tariffs. PPWSA is likely to be&#13;
affected by two types of pressures on the costs side. First, any increases in power rates&#13;
will affect the costs of water production. As power accounts for about 60 per cent of&#13;
operations and maintenance costs, the impacts are likely to be substantial. Second, if&#13;
inflation rates begin to rise, the pressures on the wage bill, as well as materials and&#13;
equipment will begin increasing. Hence, a tariff adjustment mechanism needs to be&#13;
instituted, that would be a transparent process, rather than being, as it currently is, a&#13;
political process requiring cabinet approval. During negotiations RGC agreed that annual&#13;
reviews with IDA missions could be one way introducing a tariff adjustment mechanism.&#13;
Vended water in PPWSA&#13;
22.   The prices consumers pay for water supply outside the public water utilities is a&#13;
good indicator of the seriousness of the water supply crisis. ADB has recently completed&#13;
a survey of water utilities across Asia, and its data indicate that the price of vended water&#13;
in Phnom Penh is approximately ten times the tariffs charged by PPWSA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
23.    Consultants to the ADB conducted a socio-economic survey in Phnom Penh, while&#13;
preparing the ADB's Phnom Penh Water Supply and Drainage Project. One of the&#13;
objectives of the survey was to determine the extent to which the population is affected by&#13;
water supply and sanitation services and its willingness to participate in the upgrading of&#13;
these services. The survey identified three consumer profiles.&#13;
* Consumers already connected to the PPWSA network;&#13;
* Consumers supplied by neighbors, and&#13;
* Consumers who obtain their water from vendors, wells or rivers.&#13;
24.    Even though the survey estimates that 42% of households are connected to the&#13;
network the quality, rate of flow, pressure and supply of water are low resulting in an&#13;
inadequate service. As a consequence, even this portion of the population would be&#13;
significant beneficiaries of the proposed project. The table below summarizes key survey&#13;
data.&#13;

25.   The World Health Organization (WHO) considers expenditure on water up to a&#13;
level of 5% of household income as affordable. With this yardstick, the Category 1 and 3&#13;
households in the analysis above are easily within the WHO standard but the category 2&#13;
households pay more than double what WHO considers affordable. Further, given the&#13;
assumptions used in the analysis, the data shows that both the category 2 and 3 consumers&#13;
will be better off even under the new tariff regime if they connect to the PPWSA network&#13;
and if they retain their current level of consumption. The major benefit is achieved by the&#13;
Category 2 consumers who's expenditure on water for the month would decline from&#13;
KR37,000 to KR5,600.&#13;
26.   Affordability of domestic water supplies of a number of cities in Asia was&#13;
estimated in the ADB Water Utilities Data Book published in 1993. The study showed&#13;
that the average expenditure on water as a portion of household incomes in 19 (of 23&#13;
cities surveyed) was 2% or less. The new charges proposed by PPWSA for Phnom Penh&#13;
domestic users (given estimated consumption levels) are well within the 2% for the&#13;
majority of the cities in the region as quoted in the ADB publication.&#13;
27.   As the analysis in paragraphs 23 and 24 shows, connecting to the water supply&#13;
system results in significant savings for the lower income level of the population. The main.&#13;
impediment to increasing the number of connections is the cost of connecting to the water&#13;
supply system. Current information indicates that the average cost of connecting is about&#13;
US$200 per connection. However, as part of ADB's negotiations, PPWSA agreed to&#13;
review and eventually lower the connection fees. Nevertheless, even if the fee were to be&#13;
lowered to US$150, this still exceeds one month's income for the Category 2 households&#13;
and about 40% of the average monthly income for the Category 3 households. These&#13;
costs are likely to preclude many poorer families from the connection program. The&#13;
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific of the United Nations has&#13;
found that the poor often face considerable difficulties in raising the capital required for&#13;
the initial costs of connecting to a piped water supply system. Studies in India, Pakistan,&#13;
and Bangladesh have shown that connection rates can be increased substantially if water&#13;
companies provide financing to poor customers for the cost of connecting to the piped&#13;
system.&#13;
28.   Because of the need to increase access of the poor to piped water and because of&#13;
the financial risks associated with the project it was agreed with PPWSA during final&#13;
project preparation that the project would include a pilot scheme of financing domestic&#13;
connections. It was also agreed that agreements to be reached at negotiations will include&#13;
that the RGC will cause PPWSA to revise its connection fees on the basis of actual cost.&#13;

30.   The tariffs in the table above show significant variation between the commercial&#13;
and domestic tariffs. It may be argued that if similar tariffs to those in Table AA.4 were&#13;
put in place there would be a significant cross subsidy from the brewery and industrial&#13;
sector to domestic consumers and consumers buying water at water selling points. This&#13;
argument is not believed to be valid. In the SWSA project preparation material, a total&#13;
101,000 cu. m./month is estimated to be available from the existing water supply source if&#13;
the level of the weir is raised, the sand spit sealed and the efficiency of the existing water&#13;
treatment plant is improved. This volume is approximately equal to the sum of the original&#13;
commercial consumption and the estimated new domestic consumption resulting from&#13;
improved facilities. The total estimated cost of raising the lake, sealing the sand spit and&#13;
improving the existing water treatment plant up to the level required to meet these needs&#13;
is about $0.6 million. Given these works will provide an estimated additional 65,000 cu.&#13;
m/month this equates to a capital cost of $9.20/month per cu. m of water produced. The&#13;
estimated marginal cost of improving capacity a further 31,000 cu. m/month to satisfy the&#13;
anticipated additional commercial needs is $1.3 million or $41.90/month per cu. m of&#13;
water produced. Because of this apparent significant difference in the cost of supply and&#13;
the fact that this project is to be funded by IDA, it may not be unreasonable to have a&#13;
higher commercial tariff of the magnitude discussed in this analysis.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
31.   PPWSA has improved human resources management significantly in recent years.&#13;
One major innovation has been to change the incentives for staff in order to encourage&#13;
honesty and efficiency. The new incentive system operates effectively even within the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
rigidities of municipal rules, such as those that limit [certain] salaries to the equivalent of&#13;
US$10 per month. The most important part of the incentive system gives a bill collector a&#13;
bonus for each illegal connection he or she reports. At the same time, if someone from&#13;
another department of PPWSA reports an illegal connection, that person receives the&#13;
bonus, and the collector responsible for the part of the city in question must pay a penalty&#13;
to the authority. The bonus is 20% of the fine levied on the illegally connected customer.&#13;
Since the implementation of this system, the average number of new connections&#13;
registered per month has doubled to 860 between 1995 and 1996. The number of&#13;
connections cut off has increased steadily from 262 to 623 during the period January-&#13;
September 1996.&#13;
32.   Overall, management of staff has iriiproved over the past three years at PPWSA.&#13;
Contrary to experience in many low income countries, PPWSA has not been an employer&#13;
of last resort. The number of staff per thousand connections has dropped from 18 in 1992&#13;
to 15 in 1995. The accuracy of meter reading has also improved over time from 83&#13;
percent in 1995 to 87 percent by August 1996. In addition, operating as an autonomous&#13;
entity under the new Decree, PPWSA has wider discretion to reward good performance&#13;
and penalize poor performance.&#13;
33.   One key element of the project will be staff training and development. The project&#13;
budget includes approximately $0.25 million for a national water training center in Phnom&#13;
Penh. This facility will serve both Phnom Penh and all urban regional water supply&#13;
utilities. Courses will cover both managerial and technical topics. In addition to this&#13;
training, the project's budget also includes a significant allowance for both specialized&#13;
training in Cambodia and abroad. Training will also be a key element in the proposed&#13;
twinning arrangement.&#13;

CAMBODIA&#13;
URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
CAMBODIAN PUBLIC ENTERPRISE LEGISLATION&#13;
1.    Concerned, among other things, with the need for greater clarity regarding the&#13;
legislative framework in which publicly funded and managed services operate, in June&#13;
1996 the Government of Cambodia enacted a Law on the General Status of Public&#13;
Enterprises2. This Law provides rules for the operation, governance and supervision of all&#13;
public enterprises. Although granted independent legal personality and ostensible financial&#13;
autonomy, each public enterprise is placed under a Government Ministry or some other&#13;
public authority and made subject to various State controls. In all cases, these comprise:&#13;
(a)   control by the "tutelle" Ministry, exercised by its representative(s) on the&#13;
Board of Directors of the enterprise, with a view to ensuring conformity of&#13;
Board decisions with Government policy or directives of the "tutelle"&#13;
Ministry;&#13;
(b)   the "Controle des Inspections ministerielles et services assimiles" which&#13;
consist of periodic assessments of a technical nature; and&#13;
(c)   control by a "State Controller", namned by the Minister of Economy and&#13;
Finance from within the ranks of the Ministry's senior officials, so as to&#13;
ensure:&#13;
(i)   compliance by the enterprise with its legislative and regulatory&#13;
obligations;&#13;
(ii)  the appropriate application of any decision taken by the enterprise;&#13;
(iii)  all necessary follow-up regarding the operations of the enterprise&#13;
and their appropriate evolution; and&#13;
(iv)  the appropriateness of any transaction which might have a financial&#13;
impact on the enterprise.&#13;
2.    State controllers work under the directives of the MOEF to whom they report&#13;
regularly. They are required/entitled to attend enterprise Board meetings and shareholders'&#13;
meetings. They have discretionary power to object to decisions of the Board of Directors&#13;
if the decision appears to them to be illegal, likely to diminish the "rights and interests"&#13;
either of the enterprise or the State, or incompatible with the "purposes" of the enterprise.&#13;
2  No. 0696/03 of 17 June 1996&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
Such objections must be provided on a timely basis to the Board, the MOEF and the&#13;
tutelle Ministry, with the Ministries having the power to modify or confirm the decision.&#13;
The Law is however silent on cases where the two Ministries disagree.&#13;
PPWSA-specific Legislation&#13;
3.    It is within this context - applicable to all public enterprises - that RGC, by Decree&#13;
of 4th December 1996, established PPWSA as a public enterprise under the "tutelle" of&#13;
the Ministry of the Interior. The enterprise is declared to have separate legal personality&#13;
and "administrative and financial autonomy"3.&#13;
4.    PPWSA's purpose is to ensure the production and distribution of water for public&#13;
consumption within the city of Phnom Penh. Importantly, however, PPWSA is, for the&#13;
first time, obliged to organize, manage and operate its activities independently in&#13;
accordance with conmmercial business principles and practices4.  In this connection,&#13;
PPWSA is authorized to cut-off water supply to any customer (whether public or private)&#13;
in arrears in the payment of the relevant tariff beyond the period stated in the Authority's&#13;
contract with the customer.&#13;
5.    Although it is too early to judge the extent to which non-commercial and political&#13;
objectives may conflict with PPWSA's principal objective to operate on a cost efficient&#13;
basis (and by the year 2002 without any RGC subsidy), the Decree does reduce&#13;
bureaucratic controls on managers to the maximum extent possible in the context of the&#13;
Law on Public Enterprises.&#13;
6.    Also, although the Decree does not deal directly with the issue of PPWSA's tariff&#13;
policy and the basis on which its tariffs may be permitted or required to change, the&#13;
Decree does require PPWSA's Director General to prepare an annual business plan, which&#13;
will reflect the tariff structure, for approval by PPWSA's Board of Directors,&#13;
7.    Finally, in terms of its RGC subsidized support, PPWSA operates with a certain&#13;
financial autonomy and transparency in the sense that, rather than having its accounts&#13;
merged with those of the Phnom Penh municipal government as was the previous practice&#13;
since its establishment, PPWSA has now been allocated a separate line item in the national&#13;
budget.&#13;
The Authority was formerly a public agency under the Governor of Phnom Penh and, as such, part of&#13;
the city's municipal administration.&#13;

Dear Mr. Shirazi,&#13;
Proposed Water Supply Project - Letter of Sector Objectives&#13;
1.   As you are aware, the Royal Govemment of Cambodia is committed, and has been&#13;
working with IDA, to implement the proposed.water project. During the preparation, we have&#13;
met with various IDA missions, the latest being the mission of March-April 1997. We have&#13;
also benefted considerably from the Seminar on Water Sector Policy held by the Economic&#13;
Development Institute of the Bank at the time of this mission.The purpose of this letter is to&#13;
set out our objectives in the urban water and sanitation sector and indicate our commitment&#13;
towards their attainment.&#13;
2.   The Govemment's First Socio-economic Development Plan 1996-2000 enunciates&#13;
the overall priorities of the Govemment. As emphasised therein, the wider provision of&#13;
potable water and sanitation in both rural and urban areas, both as a means of tackling one&#13;
of the root causes of poverty and as a means of improving public health, is a high priordty&#13;
for the Govemment. In formulating policies for this sector we recognise that water and&#13;
sanitation need to be managed as economic goods. Our main objective is therefore to&#13;
increase the availability of all water and sanitation services, and to do so in a manner that is&#13;
guided by demand for services from users, and encourages economic efficiency and&#13;
sustainability. To achieve this objective, we recognise that services need to be managed at&#13;
the lowest appropriate level, by organisations that are accountable to users for good and&#13;
cost effective service.&#13;
3.   The Govemment's immediate objective for Phnom Penh is to make the Phnom&#13;
Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA) a financially self-sustaining commercial entity&#13;
which will supply adequate water meeting WHO standards. Phnom Penh accounts for an&#13;
estimated 40% of the nation's GDP and the provision of reliable and cost-effective water&#13;
supply will be important to the nation's prospects for rapid growth. The Govemment is&#13;
committed to making PPWSA financially and operationally autonomous to contribute to&#13;
effrient operation and conserve scarce Govemment resources. PPWSA has been already&#13;
been corporatised as a public enterprise under the Public Enterprise Law, as part of this&#13;
process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
4.    The objective for the provincial towns is to develop financially self-sustainable&#13;
commercial organisations and to transform them into autonomous bodies. As a first step,&#13;
the water authority in Sihanoukville has been granted a large measure of financial and&#13;
operational autonomy by Ministerial Decree No.524 dated 02 September 1996. The&#13;
Sihanoukville Water Supply Authority is empowered to collect its own revenues, incur&#13;
expenditures and manage ts operations as a commercial undertaking and is no longer&#13;
subject to the Treasury Law applicable to Government Departments.&#13;
5.    There are additional current constraints in transforming the water supply units in&#13;
other towns into autonomous commercial undertakings. These are the acute shortage of&#13;
skilled manpower to operate these undertakings, the current inter-relationships between the&#13;
electricity and water operations which are under the same administrative control in most&#13;
towns, and the absence of adequate accounting and financial systems to ensure&#13;
accountability for revenues and expenditures. Our objective for these towns is to address&#13;
these institutional constraints by a concerted programme of actions. These will include&#13;
training of staff in technical, accountingl and administrative skills, and preparing and&#13;
implementing a revised institutional structure. The new institutional structure should enable&#13;
the sector to be managed at the local level, guided by local demand for services. It is&#13;
expected that the Unit for Potable Water Supply in the Ministry of Mines, Industry and&#13;
Energy will continue to provide technical support and assistance to the provincial towns. We&#13;
are now receiving technical assistance from the ADB for the restructuring of the provincial&#13;
water supply institutions. The proposed IDA project will complement this and assist us&#13;
through its training and institutional strengthening component.&#13;
6.    The Government recognises the vital importance of improved sanitation in promoting&#13;
greater well-being and better public health. The need for sanitation services is acute and will&#13;
become more so with increased water supplies. Our immediate objective is to develop a&#13;
Sanitation and Waste Water Management Strategy that is, as far as possible,&#13;
implementable, guided by demand, and fiscally sound. The Government will utilise&#13;
components of the proposed IDA Project in attaining this objective.&#13;
7.    We recognise that the level of tariffs and the manner in which tariffs are set and&#13;
revised are crucial to the autonomous commercial operation of water utilities. We are&#13;
committed to setting tariffs at levels that recover costs and assist water undertakings to&#13;
become commercially viable and cost efficient. Our objective is to develop institutional&#13;
arrangements which will enable tariffs to be revised periodically on the basis of pre-&#13;
determined rational commercial criteria. The institutional strengthening component of the&#13;
proposed World Bank project will assist us in this.&#13;
8.    Considering the severe resource constraints the nation faces, it is desirable to&#13;
encourage the participation of the private sector in water supply and sanitation. The&#13;
Govemment is conscious of the need for a suitable policy framework to attract private&#13;
participation and will work towards the evolution of an appropriate framework.&#13;
9.    The Govemment recognises that the attainment of these objectives will require a&#13;
comprehensive, coherent and long-term national policy for this sector. The Govemment is&#13;
committed to the preparation and implementation of such a Statement of Policy in&#13;
consultation with all relevant stakeholders and seeks the assistance of IDA, through the&#13;
proposed project, in this important endeavour.&#13;
10.   The First Socio-economic Development Plan recognises that responsibility within the&#13;
Govemment for urban water and sanitation is dMded not only vertically but horizontally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
There is a need for a more streamlined and rational structure for policy-making and&#13;
regulation in the sector. The evolution of such a rational structure, in consultation with IDA,&#13;
will form part of the proposed Statement of Policy. In the interim, (as already stated in the&#13;
CDC's letter 2674/96 CDC/CRDB dated 6th December 1996) a Coordinating Committee has&#13;
been constituted to co-ordinate policy in the water and sanitation sector. The Coordinating&#13;
Committee consists of senior representatives of the Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy,&#13;
the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of&#13;
Economy and Finance, the Council for the Development of Cambodia and the Phnom Penh&#13;
Municipality. The Committee , which is chaired by the representative of MIME, will oversee&#13;
the prepaiation of the Statement of Policy.&#13;
We request the World Bank to e         issing of this important and long-&#13;
awaited Project, which will go a Ion                Govemment in its efforts to&#13;
achieve the ambitious objectives set  oonomic Development Plan.&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
CAMBODIA&#13;
URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TWINNING ARRANGEMENT&#13;
BETWEEN PPWSA AND AUSTRALIAN UTILITY&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Twinning arrangements, as an instrument of technology transfer and capacity&#13;
building have a mixed record. In the water sector in Latin America, they have had a mixed&#13;
record. In the Philippines energy sector on the other hand recent interventions have been&#13;
quite a success. These are also successes in the Indonesian petroleum sector and the Fijian&#13;
telecommunication sector.&#13;
2.    The Banks Handbook of Technical Assistance defines twinning as "the&#13;
establishment of an institutional relationship between an organizational entity in a&#13;
developing country (the 'recipient') and a similar but more mature entity in another&#13;
country (the 'supplier'). It notes that twinning is mainly aimed at (and best suited to)&#13;
transfer of managerial, financial and technical skills and systems that involve the numerous&#13;
functional aspects of the recipient entity. It cites a number of advantages of twinning -&#13;
opportunities to integrate training with TA, greater flexibility to alter work programs to&#13;
needs, long-term cooperation, lower expense, encouraging developing country expertise in&#13;
consulting (where the supplier is from another developing country). It also mentions the&#13;
possible disadvantages - the supplier may lack consulting experience and developing&#13;
country experience and twinning could be a hidden form of tied aid. It recommends that&#13;
more than one TA supplier from the donor countries should tender for twinning contracts.&#13;
3.    In the design of the twinning arrangement these factors have been borne in mind.&#13;
The Phnom Penh Water &amp; Sanitation Authority (PPWSA) needs an infusion of a number&#13;
of multi-functiorial inputs covering the whole spectrum of managerial, financial and&#13;
technical systems, broader than could be delivered by specific TA. Twinning does&#13;
therefore fit the context. Among the potential disadvantages, the first two - lack of&#13;
experience in consulting/lack of developing country experience are unlikely to apply to&#13;
major suppliers from Australia. The issue of 'tied' supply remains. However, in the&#13;
context of the urgency of Cambodia's need in preparing for the IDA project, the scarcity&#13;
of resources and the ready availability of Australian funds, the commencement of a&#13;
twinning arrangement with an Australian supplier seems the most effective practicable&#13;
solution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58&#13;
Objective&#13;
4.    The objective of the twinning will be improve the institutional effectiveness of&#13;
PPWSA in respect of:&#13;
(a)   improved technical expertise in operations and maintenance;&#13;
(b)   reduction in unaccounted for water;&#13;
(c)   streamlined institutional arrangements within PPWSA for project&#13;
execution; and&#13;
(d)   operations &amp; maintenance, so as to prepare PPWSA for successful&#13;
- implementation of the proposed IDA project.&#13;
Considerations in Design and Adaptive Learning&#13;
5.    The following factors have been borne in mind in designing the TOR:&#13;
(a)   Experience has shown the importance of institutional factors including&#13;
cultural settings and social norms in affecting program effectiveness.&#13;
(b)   One way transfers of knowledge from developed to developing country&#13;
have generally failed or if successfil, not been sustainable because of&#13;
institutional differences.&#13;
(c)   Adaptive learning, whereby state-of-the-art practices are observed,&#13;
understood and then adapted to local circumstances, offers a better chance&#13;
of success.&#13;
(d)   The proposed Project has specific components of TA for procurement and&#13;
accounting, and these need not be duplicated in the twinning.&#13;
Description of Work Program&#13;
Module 1: Australian experts visit to Cambodia&#13;
6.    (a)   The Australian entity (hereinafter referred to as 'the twin') shall depute a&#13;
team of 2 experts to Phnom Penh to assess the status and needs of&#13;
PPWSA. The assessment shall be made with PPWSA staff in a&#13;
coliaborative manner.&#13;
(b)   The team shall comprise:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
(i)    a technical expert with extensive experience of water supply&#13;
systems especially transmission and distribution, and experience in&#13;
unaccounted for water reduction including at least 3 years in&#13;
developing countries; and&#13;
(ii)   a management expert with extensive senior level general&#13;
management experience in a water utility, preferably including&#13;
developing country experience, with a sound knowledge of general&#13;
management issues including personnel, relations with customers&#13;
and government regulators, billing and collection problems,&#13;
organization structure and delegation of powers etc.&#13;
7.    The technical expert shall first arrive in Phnom Penh for a two month stay,&#13;
followed a month later by the management expert for a period of one month.&#13;
8.    The PPWSA shall identify specific counterparts to work with the twin, for each of&#13;
the following 6 functional areas:&#13;
i.    Transmission system maintenance and leak detection, operations and&#13;
maintenance of treatment plants&#13;
ii.    Distribution system maintenance and leak detection.&#13;
iii.    Accounting&#13;
iv.    Metering, Billing and Collection Management.&#13;
v.    Personnel Management and Training.&#13;
vi.    General management and relationship with Government/Regulator and&#13;
consumers.&#13;
9.    In carrying out the assessment, the following shall among other things, be&#13;
considered:&#13;
reasons for illegal connections and non-detection.&#13;
existing system of bulk water metering.&#13;
existing methods of meter installation, configuration, replacement&#13;
workshop practices including repair, testing, spare parts, meter&#13;
fitting, meter reading.&#13;
use of water for operational purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60&#13;
review of distribution system, assessing pipe materials used,&#13;
construction and pipe installation methods, repairs and maintenance&#13;
methods, soil etc. conditions, traffic loadings, distribution system&#13;
pressure and variability, system mapping.&#13;
plans for leak detection, monitoring and rectification including district&#13;
metering, regular sounding, pressure management, valve inspections,&#13;
data handling and analysis, equipment and skills availability and needs.&#13;
10.   The experts shall prior to departure from Cambodia prepare a report setting out a)&#13;
the findings of the assessment and b) making specific recommendations to remedy the&#13;
various problems identified. While the report may cover the whole gamut of issues, it&#13;
shall (in addition to general findings) have specific sections on each of the six functional&#13;
areas listed in paragraph 4 above. The experts shall discuss, as far as may be practicable,&#13;
their recommendations with the identified PPWSA counterparts for each functional area.&#13;
A copy of the Report shall be furnished to the IDA Project Coordinator and to MIME (for&#13;
information).&#13;
Module 2: Overseas study tour and hands-on learning&#13;
11.   This module will comprise two parts. The first will be a long duration study tour to&#13;
the Australian utility ( 45 days) which will expose the Cambodian team to efficient utility&#13;
practices and involve hands-on learning by the Cambodians in the context of an actual&#13;
running utility. The second will be a short duration study tour (1-2 weeks) of one other&#13;
developed country (to be determined in consultation with IDA). This tour (estimated to&#13;
cost about $25,000 but in any case not to exceed $30,000) will involve visits to, and&#13;
interaction with, a public sector utility and an independent regulator, with emphasis on&#13;
regulatory, tariff-setting and policy aspects. The sequence of the two tours is flexible. The&#13;
composition of the Cambodian team for the short duration study tour (to be finalized in&#13;
consultation with IDA) will reflect the emphasis on regulatory issues and may include&#13;
representatives of concerned Ministries.&#13;
12.   As soon as the experts return to Australia at the end of Module 1, the twin shall&#13;
make preparatory arrangements for the visit to Australia of the Cambodian counterparts.&#13;
13.   Approximately a month after the departure of the experts, the five Cambodian&#13;
counterparts (other than the counterpart dealing with general management) will proceed&#13;
to Australia for a 45 day adaptive learning visit. One person among the five (whom&#13;
PPWSA shall so designate) shall be the team leader and will coordinate the visit. The team&#13;
shall also be accompanied by a seventh member deputed by MIME. All members of the&#13;
team shall be Cambodian nationals. The functional counterpart dealing with general&#13;
management and regulatory issues ( who is expected to be the Executive Director of&#13;
PPWSA) will join the team for the last 15 days of its visit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61&#13;
14.   During their stay in Australia, the twin shall demonstrate and explain to the&#13;
Cambodian team the prevailing practices of the twin in all functional areas with special&#13;
emphasis on aspects where PPWSA has major problems. The emphasis shall be on&#13;
hands-on training and field visits. The 2 Experts who went to Cambodia shall be closely&#13;
associated with the team as far as practicable.&#13;
15.   Apart from unaccounted for water, 0 &amp; M and technical and managerial areas&#13;
identified by the experts, the team -- particularly the functional member on Management'&#13;
issues from PPWSA and the MIME member -- shall study the:&#13;
i.    Scheme of delegation of powers - the types of matters that are referred&#13;
to the Board of the twin, the extent to which operational staff can take&#13;
decisions, financial powers at various levels, personnel hiring/firing&#13;
powers.&#13;
ii.    Manner in which the twin is regulated; when and how the regulator/&#13;
Government.        exercises control&#13;
iii.    Twin's procedures for redressing customer complaints,&#13;
remedies (including legal) available to consumers against&#13;
the utility.&#13;
iv.    Twin's system of management information and control;&#13;
how staff who are given more authority, are made&#13;
accountable.&#13;
v.    Twin's financial rules and procedures, systems for fraud&#13;
prevention.&#13;
vi.    Twin's tariff structure and the rationale therefor.&#13;
The above list is inclusive and not a full listing of areas to be covered.&#13;
16.   Pnor to departure from Australia, each member of the PPWSA team shall prepare&#13;
a report on his functional area in which he shall cover:&#13;
(a)   what he has seen and learnt during the visit;&#13;
(b)   whether, in the light of his experience, he wishes to accept,&#13;
modify or reject the recommendations made earlier by the&#13;
Australian experts; and&#13;
(c)   his own further specific recommendations in his functional area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62&#13;
17.   These reports shall be given to the twin before departure. The twin will comment&#13;
on the report within one month of the Cambodian team's departure&#13;
18.   The team member from MIME shall prepare a report on his experiences and&#13;
recommendations applicable to his organization.&#13;
19.   On return to Cambodia, the reports (along with the comments of the twin) shall be&#13;
compiled and placed before the Board of PPWSA. Copies of the report (&amp; comments)&#13;
shall be sent to the IDA / PC I MIME/ Coordinating Committee.&#13;
Module 3 : Australian experts' second visit to Cambodia&#13;
20.   At such time as PPWSA and the twin may deem most appropriate, but not more&#13;
than 5 months after the return of the Cambodian team, the Australian experts shall return&#13;
to Cambodia for a 45 day stay. This visit shall be used for assessment and problem-&#13;
solving on the following:&#13;
(i)   how much of the recommended action has been implemented;&#13;
(ii)   problems encountered during implementation;&#13;
(iii)  if any recommendation has not been implemented, reasons&#13;
therefor; and&#13;
(iv)  further suggestions and plans of action.&#13;
21.   During the second visit the technical expert shall also, in consultation with the&#13;
Team Leader in PPWSA, prepare a suggested list of equipment or other items to be&#13;
procured for reduction of technical losses under the relevant component of the project.&#13;
22.   At the conclusion of the second visit, the twin shall prepare a completion report&#13;
setting out its findings and recommendations, based on paragraphs 13 and 14 above. The&#13;
report shall be submitted to PPWSA with copies to the IDA Project Coordinator, MIME&#13;
and IDA.&#13;
General&#13;
23.   Throughout the duration of the arrangement, the twin shall ensure that technical&#13;
assistance, advice and inputs given under the arrangement are fully consistent with the&#13;
technical assistance received by PPWSA under the proposed IDA project and for this&#13;
purpose shall maintain a close liaison with the IDA Project Coordinator and all IDA&#13;
Project technical assistance personnel. The aim should be to achieve a consistency of&#13;
strategy, avoid duplication or contradiction and maximize synergy.&#13;
Estimated Costs:&#13;

Continuation of twinning arrangement&#13;
25.   The results of the twinning arrangement will be evaluated. If the arrangement is&#13;
found to have been a success, funds available under the Reduction of Unaccounted-for&#13;
Water sub-component of the proposed IDA-financed Cambodia Urban Water Supply&#13;
project can be used to finance a new, longer term, twinning arrangement, the twin being&#13;
selected in accordance with World Bank procurement guidelines.&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
CAMBODIA&#13;
URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Phnom Penh Water Supply Improvements&#13;
1. Works&#13;
1.1   This component of the project is designed to increase the quantity of treated water&#13;
available in the City of Phnom Penh. The City's water supply system comprises a&#13;
distribution network of about 307 km of pipes, 80% of which are over 40 years old, two&#13;
pumping stations, five reservoirs with a total capacity of 24,500 cu. m, and two treatment&#13;
plants--Phum Prek (with production capacity of 100,000 cu. ni/day) and Charncar Mom&#13;
(with production capacity of 10,000 cu.m./day), both of which have been rehabilitated&#13;
with Japanese and French assistance, respectively. The total supply of 110,000 cu. n/day&#13;
is being fully absorbed. A third treatment plant--the Chruoy Chang War--on the bank of&#13;
the Mekong River has been out of operation since 1983 on account of damage to raw&#13;
water mains and deterioration of the facilities.&#13;
Water Demand:&#13;
1.2   PPWSA has adopted the water demand forecast which has been prepared by&#13;
consultants for planning the implementation schedule of water treatment plants and for the&#13;
calibration of the distribution network. The demand is based on population projections for&#13;
Phnom Penh which show and increase from 1,075,000 in 1995 to 1,450,000 in 2005 and&#13;
2,240,000 in 2015. The average day demand is estimated at 193,390 m3/day (maximum&#13;
day demand 248,700) in 1996--83,390 m3/day in excess of the available supply. Demand&#13;
is projected to rise to 211,500 m3/day by the year 2000. Capacity will have to be raised&#13;
by an additional 101,500 m3/day to meet the projected demand. Recently PPWSA revised&#13;
this level upwards using a higher consumption figure.&#13;
1.3   To meet the increased demand PPWSA proposes to rehabilitate and extend the&#13;
Chruoy Chan War water treatment plant. At full operation, the plant is expected to&#13;
provide an additional 65,000 m3/day.&#13;
1.4   The scope of work under this sub-component of the project covers: (i) the&#13;
rehabilitation and extension of the Chruoy Chan War water treatment plant; and (ii) the&#13;
supply of pipes and ancillary equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72&#13;
Water Treatment Plant&#13;
Design considerations:&#13;
1.5   The design considerations for the selection of the treatment process at Chruoy&#13;
Chang War focused on three altematives: (a) the rehabilitation/replacement of the existing&#13;
plant facilities; (b) the-rehabilitation/replacement of most of the existing structures of the&#13;
plant; and (c) the construction of a new treatment plant at a different location. The&#13;
feasibility study conducted an evaluation of these alternatives including impact evaluation,&#13;
technical comparison, estimation of investment and recurrent costs as well as an economic&#13;
comparison of alternatives. Alternative (b) offers the best balance between the simplicity in&#13;
operation, cost efficiency and possibilities for future extensions. Optimum utilization of the&#13;
existing facilities and structures were considered while maintaining the desired plant&#13;
efficiency. The proposed scheme is a well-proven, conventional treatment process for&#13;
surface water which would be easy to operate and maintain. It comprises basically the&#13;
following steps: coagulation/flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection and pH&#13;
correction (if necessary).&#13;
1.6   Preliminary engineering designs prepared by consultants, were reviewed by&#13;
PPWSA and the Bank. The Bank also employed the services of a leading consultancy firm&#13;
experienced in the design of water treatment plants for an independent review of the&#13;
design. The basic aspects of the preliminary designs considered soil conditions and&#13;
investigations, topographical and hydrological conditions, characteristics of the raw water,&#13;
and an analysis of existing structures. The Bank has reviewed the preliminary designs and&#13;
found them satisfactory. The work will be bid and executed on a turnkey basis including&#13;
detailed design, supply, construction, installation and testing.&#13;
1.7   This component will consist of&#13;
(a)   Construction of new sedimentation tanks, rapid gravity sand filters and&#13;
clear water reservoir as well as mechanical and electrical equipment to&#13;
produce 65,000 cu. m of potable water per day;&#13;
(b)   Rehabilitation of other existing structures including intake structure, river&#13;
bank protection, laboratory, pumping station, 2,000 cu. m clear well&#13;
reservoir, gatehouse and pipework;&#13;
(c)   All interconnecting pipework, drains and roads, fencing, lighting, etc.;&#13;
(d)   Construction of new accommodation block and flow meter house;&#13;
(e)   Rehabilitation of two high level reservoirs;&#13;
(f)    Laying of 2.5 km of 800 mm diameter transmission main, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73&#13;
(g)   Crossing of the Tonle Sap River by attaching two pipes to the Chrouy&#13;
Chang War Bridge.&#13;
Supply of Pipes and Ancillary Equipment:&#13;
1.8   The scope of work for the Phnom Penh Water Supply component also covers the&#13;
supply of about 85 km of pipes and fittings. Pipe material for about 14 km will be ductile&#13;
iron and the rest will be high density polyethylene (HDPE). These will provide piped water&#13;
supply in the southern district of Chamcar Morn District which has been designated by&#13;
PPWSA for IDA assistance. The pipes will form the secondary and tertiary network in the&#13;
area and will serve many income groups, including low income communities which&#13;
currently do not have access to piped water. The Bank has reviewed the bidding&#13;
documents prepared by PPWSA for the procurement of pipes and ancillary equipment and&#13;
found them to be satisfactory. PPWSA will finance the installation of the pipes and related&#13;
works in the secondary and tertiary network, at an expected cost of $ 5.49 million.&#13;
Operation and Maintenance:&#13;
1.9   The turnkey contractor will prepare a detailed O&amp;M manual for the site and works&#13;
for routine operation procedures and maintenance requirements to be followed on a daily,&#13;
weekly, monthly and yearly basis. These will include training requirements for skilled&#13;
operators and maintenance personnel, treated raw water sampling and testing records,&#13;
chemical storage and use, dosing levels, checks on electrical and mechanical equipment,&#13;
routine and specific maintenance of plant and health and safety regulations. PPWSA plans&#13;
to deploy 40 personnel for operation and maintenance of the plant which is considered&#13;
reasonable in relation to the 45 personnel currently employed in the existing Phum Prek&#13;
WTP. Personnel will be selected from among PPWSA staff and/or recruited as necessary.&#13;
They will undergo on-site training one month before commissioning of the plant and three&#13;
months during commissioning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74&#13;
2. Pilot Proeram for Financial Assistance for new connections&#13;
Background:&#13;
2.1   Given the low levels of income, the cost of connecting to the water system is&#13;
beyond the means of many households. Yet, once connected, households realize large&#13;
savings since the recurring costs of alternative sources of water are far higher. A scheme&#13;
of financing which enables households to defer payment of the initial connection cost&#13;
would have the following benefits:-&#13;
a) it would give access to cheaper, cleaner drinking water to some of the&#13;
households who need it most;&#13;
b) it would assist the utility in its process of commercialization by expanding the&#13;
market for its water.&#13;
2.2   To be sustainable however, any such scheme would need to be financially viable to&#13;
the utility in terms of both, recovering the loan itself and in terms of covering the cost of&#13;
funds, and to be administratively practicable. The outline scheme described below attempts&#13;
to meet these criteria.&#13;
Details of Pilot program:&#13;
2.3   Any person wishing to take a domestic water connection from PPWSA will be&#13;
eligible to be financed under the program, if he agrees to the terms of the program.&#13;
2.4   The program will finance part of the cost of a new water connection subject to a&#13;
maximum per connection which will be determined by PPWSA. Initially it is expected that&#13;
the maximum financing will be $100 per connection but this may be reduced when&#13;
connection costs are reduced under the project.&#13;
2.5   Applications for financing will only be considered after the applicant has deposited&#13;
an application fee of such sum as PPWSA may determine. This sum is initially expected to&#13;
be in the region of $20. The application fee will be refunded if the application is rejected.&#13;
If the application is accepted, the application fee will be adjusted against the down&#13;
payment due from the applicant.&#13;
2.6   In order to keep the administration of the scheme simple, avoid accounting&#13;
problems and reduce administrative overheads, financing will only be offered in a standard&#13;
package or a maximum of two standard packages. The exact size of the package(s) will be&#13;
determined by PPWSA. A standard package would comprise:-&#13;
i.    a standard loan amount (say, $50)&#13;
ii.    a standard repayment period (say, 24 months)&#13;
iii.   a standard interest rate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75&#13;
iv.   a standard set of monthly or bi-monthly or quarterly installments payable&#13;
with the water bill, calculated on the basis of i. to iii above.&#13;
2.7   PPWSA may determine the details of the package(s) subject to the following&#13;
parameters:-&#13;
a) the rate of interest charged shall reflect the prevailing cost of funds for&#13;
consumer loans from the banking system and PPWSA's overheads in&#13;
administering the program, but shall in no case be less than 18% per annum;&#13;
b) financing shall always be partial and shall never exceed $100 per connection;&#13;
c) the repayment period shall not exceed 2 years from the date of connection.&#13;
2.8   On approval of an application for financing under the program, the applicant shall&#13;
be required, within such period as PPWSA may specify, to make a down payment which&#13;
shall cover the difference between the cost of the connection and the amount of financing&#13;
(after adjusting the application fee already paid under paragraph 3 above). It is to be noted&#13;
that since the package itself will be of a standard amount, the down payment will vary&#13;
from case to case depending on the cost of a particular connection.&#13;
2.9   All persons who receive financing under the program shall enter into a binding&#13;
agreement with PPWSA whereby they agree to pay the agreed installments along with&#13;
their water bills and whereby non-payment of any installment will entitle PPWSA to&#13;
disconnect water supply even if water bills have been paid. This agreement shall be in such&#13;
form as PPWSA may, on appropriate legal advice, determine to be necessary and adequate&#13;
and may contain such other terms as PPWSA may deem necessary to ensure operational&#13;
feasibility and promote loan recovery.&#13;
2.10 All amounts, including interest, received as installments from consumers shall be&#13;
credited to a separate Revolving Fund account and shall not be credited to general&#13;
revenues of PPWSA. Balances in the Revolving Fund shall be used for further financing&#13;
under the same terms.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
CAMBODIA&#13;
URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
SIHANOUKVILLE WATER SUPPLY IPROVEMENTS&#13;
1. Works&#13;
1.1   This component of the project is designed to increase the quantity of treated water&#13;
available in the port city of Sihanoukville. The 1,700 cu. m per day of water produced by&#13;
the Sihanoukville Water Supply Authority (SWSA) currently meets the needs of only 11&#13;
percent of the city's population of 47,000. Yet, the opportunities for employment with&#13;
support and service industries associated with the port, tourist activities and new&#13;
businesses establishing in Sihanoukville, has necessitated further improvements and&#13;
upgrading of the water supply system to serve the residents and the increasing population.&#13;
Based on current population trends, the average daily demand for water is projected at&#13;
10,000 cu. m in the year 2000. This is far in excess of the proposed daily supply of 5,200&#13;
cu. m under the project. Capacity will have to be raised even further in the medium term&#13;
through the exploration of alternative sources of water.&#13;
1.2   To meet part of the demand for water it is proposed under the project to augment&#13;
supply and improve distribution and access. On the supply augmentation side the&#13;
proposals are the following:&#13;
(a)   The lake level will be raised by constructing a new weir crest against the&#13;
existing bridge abutments. This will increase the lake storage by around&#13;
100,000 cu. m/day and the dry season draft by 500 cu. m/day.&#13;
(b)   Geological investigations associated with the development of the final&#13;
design for the new weir structure have identified the existence of&#13;
considerable groundwater flow through the area of the lake and&#13;
surrounding country. The volume of this flow is greater than the&#13;
withdrawal presently made from the lake (2,100 cu. m/day). The retention&#13;
of the flow through the lake and the consequent losses through the sandspit&#13;
to the sea would optimize the benefit of raising the lake level. The civil&#13;
works contract for the raising of the weir will therefore include&#13;
investigations to confirm the estimates made of the depth of the sandspit&#13;
and the construction of an impermeable barrier at the lake edge to reduce&#13;
the losses. This low-cost intervention will increase the safe sustainable draft&#13;
from the lake by about 1,100 cu. m/day. (Lowering the foot-valve in the&#13;
suction intake to the raw water pumps can provide a further sustainable&#13;
capacity of up to 300 cu. m/day.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77&#13;
(c)   Four new wells--with total capacity of 1,500 cu. m/day--will be&#13;
constructed and equipped.&#13;
1.3   To expand the availability of the increased supply to a larger section of the&#13;
population, 20 tanker filling and water selling points will be constructed as also&#13;
improvements to storage capacity through the construction of a high level reservoir.&#13;
Design:&#13;
1.4   The component would thus involve:&#13;
(a)   Increasing the storage volume of the raw water lake by&#13;
raising the outlet weir, and sealing off the sand spit;&#13;
(b)   Installation of four new groundwater wells in proximity to&#13;
the former wells which have been out of operation; installation of power&#13;
supplies, standby generators and control panels;&#13;
(c)   Improvements to treatment plant and raw water pumping station&#13;
including: (1) procurement and supply of pipes and fittings and&#13;
accessories, raw water pumps, generator, control panels and metering; (2)&#13;
procurement of laboratory and office equipment;(3) procurement of a&#13;
vehicle and 7 motorcycles; (4) tools and equipment; (5) backwash&#13;
recycling tank, and (6) sandbag for sludge removal;&#13;
(d)   Improvements to distribution system including&#13;
procurement and laying of pipes and fittings; establishment of tanker&#13;
filling and water selling points;&#13;
(e)   connection of wells to distribution network including&#13;
supply and laying of pipes,&#13;
(f)   additional 3,000 cu. m high level reservoir within distribution system; and&#13;
(g)   consulting services for: (i) one full time professional&#13;
support to the Unit of Potable Water Supply for overall planning and&#13;
management; (ii) a socio-economic survey to establish the customer base&#13;
and their effective demand for water services; (iii) engineering advice to&#13;
check design of groundwater deferrination plant and expansion of&#13;
reticulation system; (iv) the development of SWSA's accounting and&#13;
monitoring system to meet the requirements of the authority as a&#13;
financially autonomous entity; and (v) studies on long term water sources&#13;
for Sihanoukville.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78&#13;
1.5   Engineering design for (a) and (b) has been carried out by consultants. Bidding&#13;
documents are under preparation. Since the safe yield from the groundwater wells and the&#13;
chemical quality will only be determined after drilling and testing of wells, final design and&#13;
specifications for the submersible pumps, the deferrination plant, and distribution works&#13;
will be undertaken following the drilling of the wells.&#13;

including at least 3 years in public sector reform in developing countries. Experience in a water&#13;
utility, especially in a developing country, would be an added advantage. The candidate's&#13;
experience profile would be the crucial factor in determining suitability.&#13;
Task:&#13;
5.    General approach: The Consultant shall be guided by the need to ensure that incentives for&#13;
different organizations are carefully structured to ensure that all of them work towards agreed&#13;
economically rational objectives; the existence of appropriate organizational incentives for all&#13;
stakeholders will be crucial in minimizing conflict and in coordinating efforts. The Consultant shall&#13;
ensure that suggested organization structures are designed to take this into account and shall&#13;
design administrative processes that reflect the appropriate incentive structure rather than a&#13;
structure of "command and control". Within this overall framework the Consultant shall:-&#13;
(a)   Prepare detailed administrative guidelines for the allocation of work amongst the&#13;
different policy-making ministries/bodies, pursuant to the principles of&#13;
reorganization set out in the water policy, including procedures for resolving&#13;
inter-departmental differences in a time-bound manner&#13;
(b)   Review organization structure of reorganized Ministries/other policy-making&#13;
bodies and suggest improvements;&#13;
(c)   Review procedures for processing of all water sector decisions in the Ministries&#13;
and suggest incentive improvements in different functionaries and agencies to&#13;
act promptly and rationally, and building capacity for analysis of investments on&#13;
cost-benefit basis.&#13;
(d)   Identify specific training needs for Ministries, etc. for funding under the project;&#13;
(e)   Draw up detailed and specific guidelines for matters which:&#13;
(a) will,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82&#13;
(b) will not require ministerial approval under the autonomy granted/to&#13;
be granted to utilities, keeping in mind the need for adequate autonomy in utility&#13;
management;&#13;
(f)   In respect of matters which will require ministerial approval, prepare a clear,&#13;
simple and prompt procedure for approval, with time limits; "negative' approval -&#13;
i.e. proposals deemed to be approved if not objected to within a specified period -&#13;
should be considered whenever possible, especially in respect of procurement and&#13;
tariff matters:&#13;
(g)   Prepare guidelines for Government nominee directors and the State Controller on&#13;
the Board's of utilities on their roles and functions as non-executive directors,&#13;
keeping in mind the need for operational autonomy;&#13;
(h)   Streamline procedures for release of funds to utilities from the government budget;&#13;
(i)    Evolve a mechanism for fiduciary accountability of the utility to government as&#13;
owner, for results and impacts (rather than processes and procedures), through the&#13;
Business Plan and Budget using such devices as may be appropriate, e.g.&#13;
- targets for expansion of coverage&#13;
- targets for billing efficiency ,collection and coverage of the poor&#13;
- targets for return on capital employed&#13;
- targets for completion of capital works on schedule&#13;
- targets for productivity of labor and cost effectiveness.&#13;
(i)    Evolve a strong institutional mechanism for accountability to consumers and&#13;
responsiveness to consumer grievances.&#13;
(k)   Review internal procedures of utilities other than PPWSA, delegation of powers&#13;
to various levels, etc. and suggest improvements to enhance effectiveness. In&#13;
respect of procurement procedures, the consultant shall work in consultation with&#13;
the Project Coordinator, who shall be primarily responsible for procurement&#13;
aspects of procedures;&#13;
(1)    Assist the Project Coordinator/Team Leader and AccQunting Expert in PPWSA in&#13;
procedural reform to the extent requested by them.&#13;
Outputs:&#13;
6.    The Consultant shall submit a written report on each of items (a) to (k), of which the&#13;
report on items (a) to (b) shall be submitted within 3 months of commencement of assignment.&#13;
The Report will be submitted to the Council for the Development of Cambodia with copies to the&#13;
IDA Project Coordinator, and IDA.&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;
CAMBODIA&#13;
URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Terms of Reference for Sanitation and Waste Water Management Study&#13;
in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Cambodia has requested assistance from the World Bank to finance reconstruction of the&#13;
country's urban infrastructure. During the preparation of the Bank-financed Water Rehabilitation&#13;
Project in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, concerns have been raised that sanitation and waste&#13;
water management problems have not been mitigated. In order to mitigate against long term&#13;
environmental damage, a consultant team, consisting of individuals with global sectoral&#13;
knowledge will assist RGC's Coordinating Committee for the Water and Sanitation Sector&#13;
develop a sanitation policy framework, which will lead to a strategic and cost-effective program&#13;
of investments in sewerage and drainage infrastructure in Phnom Penh and large provincial towns.&#13;
2.    Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in the world, is currently rebuilding its&#13;
infrastructure after decades of internal conflict and genocide. As part of the reconstruction effort,&#13;
RGC has requested assistance from the World Bank to finance investments and develop an&#13;
appropriate water and sanitation policy framework.&#13;
3.    Urban sanitation problems in Cambodian cities affect all sections of the population. In&#13;
particular, the poor residents are severely affected as poor are they are often live in low-lying&#13;
areas, and use on contaminated water supply sources for washing, bathing, and often even for&#13;
drinking. The problem of inadequate sanitation infrastructure has been accentuated by the absence&#13;
of a coherent policy framework, and limited capacity in sectoral institutions to develop such a&#13;
framework to lay out pricing rules, investment criteria and financing options to tackle the&#13;
problems of urban sanitation and disposal of untreated wastewater. Cambodian institutions thus&#13;
stand to benefit from global best practices on how to invest in basic sanitation and wastewater&#13;
disposal infrastructure in a sustainable and cost-effective manner.&#13;
Objectives and Scope of Consultancy&#13;
4.    The purpose of the Consultancy is, to advise RGC, and major water utilities (PPWSA and&#13;
SWSA), on the basis of global best practices, on how best to address current waste water&#13;
management problems, so that services are provided on the basis of (i) what beneficiaries and&#13;
communities want and are willing to pay for, and (ii) the services are managed at the lowest&#13;
appropriate level.&#13;
5.    In order to accomplish the consultancy objectives, the consultant team will distill best&#13;
practices from the global experience, utilize information gathered from existing studies on the&#13;
subject in Cambodia, and recommend to RGC a strategic plan for resolving the problems of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84&#13;
sanitation and wastewater collection and disposal in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville. The lessons&#13;
learned from the exercise is expected to be applied in other Cambodian provincial towns as well.&#13;
6.    The consultancy will be funded through the Water Policy component, under the overall&#13;
supervision of the Coordinating Committee for the Water and Sanitation sector. Day to day&#13;
supervision will be exercised by MIME. The consultant team will endeavor to build consensus&#13;
and involve all the stakeholders - from the community level to the government level - in the&#13;
process of developing the strategy. Since sanitation and waste water management issues cut&#13;
across several sectors, the consultant's recommendations will be coursed a Committee - either&#13;
directly through the Coordination Committee, or any Steering Committee nominated by the&#13;
former, and comprising key stakeholders from the Government, PPWSA and SWSA,&#13;
municipalities and community representatives. The Steering Committee, with technical assistance&#13;
from the consultant, will also supervise the completion of a Strategic Sanitation Plan (partially&#13;
financed from this TA), that would propose a series of investments after undertaking a process of&#13;
user consultations. Mitigation activities proposed thereafter could be packaged as investment&#13;
programs for possible funding by donor agencies, including IDA.&#13;

Initial Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
85&#13;
8.    The initial review will be a desk review of available documentation. The Consultant is&#13;
expected to be fully versed with global best practices in the water and sanitation sector. As far as&#13;
the Cambodian literature and experiences, the consultant will be expected to thoroughly review&#13;
the information available. Several Government agencies, NGOs, and donors are currently working&#13;
in this sector, and their help and participation will be encouraged. Below is an indicative list of&#13;
the organizations with interests in this sector:&#13;
i. Comite' International de la Croix Rouge - ICRC ICRC Water and Sanitation&#13;
Programme in Cambodian Prisons&#13;
ii. Partnership for Development in Kampuchea Urban Community Development&#13;
Programme Redd Bama Project&#13;
iii. United Nations Children Fund - UNICEF Water and Environmental Sanitation World&#13;
Food Programme - WFP Infrastructure Development and &amp; Employment Creation&#13;
iv. SKIP (Stiftung Kinderdorf Pestalozzi) Urban Community Development&#13;
9.    Other agencies with interest in the sanitation and wastewater sector:&#13;
Caritas Cambodia&#13;
OXFAM&#13;
Private Agencies Collaborating Together (PACT)&#13;
Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO)&#13;
United Nations Development Program (UNDP)&#13;
Asia Development Bank (ADB)&#13;

Mitigation Activities&#13;
10.   During the preparation of the Project, several environmental issues were raised regarding&#13;
waste water management in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville. The consultant team is expected to&#13;
facilitate common understanding of the issues, and recommended possible technical solutions that&#13;
are consistent with the feedback from users in order to finalize a Sanitation and Wastewater&#13;
Management Strategy Report. The expectation is that the lessons derived from the pilot activities&#13;
would be applicable to all other urban areas in Cambodia.&#13;
Strategic Sanitation Plan for Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville&#13;
11.   After the Strategy Report is completed the consultant team will assist RGC supervise the&#13;
development of a Strategic Sanitation Plan for Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, based on local&#13;
conditions (described below). These Plans will consist of (i) verification, through the&#13;
development of a long-term financial planning model, the willingness and ability to pay by RGC,&#13;
municipal agencies and the respective water utilities for the proposed trunk investments, (ii) a&#13;
preliminary feasibility study, outlining the strategic trunk investments considered essential to&#13;
support a sanitation and wastewater infrastructure plan, and (iii) user decisions on the requisite&#13;
feeder infrastructure, based on local preferences and willingness to pay. Items (ii) and (iii) will&#13;
require separate financing, and are not covered by this TOR. However, the consultant team will&#13;
be expected to provide guidance and specialized inputs in these activities as well, which will lead&#13;
to the finalization of Strategic Sanitation Plans for Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville.&#13;
Sanitation and Waste Water Management problems in Phnom Penh&#13;
12.   Currently, the residents of Phnom Penh are relying on poorly constructed septic tanks and&#13;
pit latrines for human waste disposal. The drainage system in the city functions as open sewers,&#13;
and untreated effluents are discharged into the Tonle Sap River through four outfalls and to a&#13;
nearby lake through four or five main discharge points. One discharge to the lake is through&#13;
approximately six kilometer of open sewer. The sewage is high in surfactant. Though surfactants&#13;
are not usually harmful, they lower oxygen levels and there is a tendency for other pollutants,&#13;
including pathogens, to concentrate in the foam. The need is clearly to develop a cost effective&#13;
and strategic investment program for tackling the problem of inadequate sanitation and&#13;
wastewater infrastructure.&#13;
Sanitation and Waste Water Management problems in Sihanoukville&#13;
13.   Sihanoukville is a relatively small town compared to Phnom Penh. However, the town is&#13;
an unspoiled coastal community, with tremendous potentials for tourism. As in the case of&#13;
Phnom Penh, there is virtually no sanitation or waste water infrastructure. For example, a new&#13;
housing scheme was constructing a sewage outfall with direct discharge to a recreational beach&#13;
area. Additionally, a brewery in Sihanoukville, which is consuming a considerable part of the&#13;
water supply, has no waste water disposal mechanisms, aside from direct dumping into the ocean&#13;
because legal liabilities of polluters have not been adequately defined.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
87&#13;
14.   The Strategic Sanitation Plan for the two cities will be developed through a participative&#13;
process, involving the key stakeholders in deciding between technical options, agreeing to the&#13;
financing plan, and finalizing the operations and maintenance program, after construction has been&#13;
completed.&#13;

WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
L. Overview&#13;
1.    Cambodia Urban Water Supply Project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) system - which&#13;
was be confirmed at negotiations - was designed to provide project managers with information on&#13;
progress made towards accomplishing project objectives and its impact on beneficiaries.&#13;
Information on institutional, technical and financial aspects will also be periodically collected so&#13;
that the specific needs of a 'bottom-up', transparent, project design are met.&#13;
2.    The M&amp;E system has two distinct aspects. The first relates to tracking quantitative&#13;
information showing financial and physical progress in achieving project milestones. The second&#13;
relates to reviewing the impact of project implementation, so that there is an opportunity to&#13;
change or modify the succeeding year's program design. The latter depends on the extent to&#13;
which information gathered enables contractors, consultants, PPWSA, MIME/SWSA, relevant&#13;
national agencies, and IDA understand what appears to be working and what isn't during the&#13;
course of project implementation. Financial and physical progress will be gathered from (i)&#13;
supervision reports on financial and accounting information and (ii) project team staff,&#13;
consultants, and contractors during studies, design works, civil works, and project supervisions.&#13;
Collected information will be analyzed jointly by project consultants, PPWSA, MIME/SWSA, the&#13;
Coordinating Committee, and IDA.&#13;
3.    Key performance indicators, which can be either numeric or qualitative, were confirmed at&#13;
negotiations. The indicators are classified into the following categories:&#13;
a) Input indicators measuring the quantity (and sometimes also quality) of resources&#13;
provided for project activities.&#13;
b) Output indicators measuring the quantity (and sometimes quality) of services that have&#13;
been created or provided through the use of inputs.&#13;
c) Outcome indicators measuring the quantity (and sometimes quality) of direct results that&#13;
have been achieved through the provision of project services.&#13;
d) Impact indicators measuring the degree to which wider sector/project objectives are being&#13;
achieved through the direct outcomes of project activities.&#13;
4.    Overall, input/output indicators are measures of implementation performance, and&#13;
outcome/impact indicators form the basis for monitoring the impact of the project. These&#13;
indicators will be supplemented by qualitative evaluations of project performance.&#13;

ANNEX 16&#13;
CAMBODIA&#13;
URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Financial Analysis&#13;
A.   Financing Rationale&#13;
1.    The proposed project will finance the expansion of water supply and distribution&#13;
for the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA) and the Sihanoukville Water&#13;
Supply Authority (SWSA) as well as strengthen the institutional capacity of both&#13;
institutions to improve operating and financial performance. The successful financing of&#13;
the proposed project rests on a number of important outcomes, including:&#13;
1)    Approval and implementation in 1997 of the proposed tariff structure&#13;
which will allow the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority to fully recover costs.&#13;
2)    Implementation of the sub-decree which commercializes Phnom Penh&#13;
PPWSA and establishes it as a financially autonomous entity.&#13;
3)    Adoption and retention by PPWSA's new board of directors of policies&#13;
which are consistent to the organization's long-term financial sustainability.&#13;
4)    Establishment of a regulatory and institutional framework for maintaining&#13;
service standards and for ensuring the long-term financial viability of the&#13;
enterprises within the sector, particularly in re-setting tariffs to ensure full cost&#13;
recovery.&#13;
5)    Continuation of PPWSA's recent progress in improving its operating and&#13;
financial performance efficiency, particularly with regard to water losses,&#13;
commercial practices and the management of its working capital.&#13;
B.    The Water Authority Financial Projection Model&#13;
2.    A fully integrated financial projection model was developed to support the&#13;
financial analysis of the proposed project and to assess the financial implications to    *&#13;
PPWSA and the SWSA of the various policy options that are currently under&#13;
consideration by the Government. The model addresses the implications of the new water&#13;
tariff levels and structure and the new installation charges that were adopted by the&#13;
Government. Essentially, all important elements of the project were incorporated in order&#13;
to assess the related financial implications and long-term viability. The financial model&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
114&#13;
accepts as inputs, basic assumptions on revenues, operating expenses, new investment and&#13;
ongoing capital expenditures, financial management and current operating performance&#13;
efficiency, in addition to other assumptions on financing and amortization of existing&#13;
loans.&#13;
3.    The financial model was programmed to simulate the activity of a water authority&#13;
which focuses essentially on water supply and distribution to its customer base. Existing&#13;
financial and accounting principles currently adopted by the water authority were&#13;
incorporated to simulate as much as possible the financial management principles of&#13;
PPWSA and SWSA. As such, the total funds available through internal and external&#13;
financing sources are allocated based on specific priorities as would typically be done by&#13;
their respective directors of finance. Requirements for working capital, obligations for&#13;
debt servicing are fiilfilled first in order to finance ongoing operations of the water&#13;
authority. Then, new investment requirements are satisfied, first from the remaining&#13;
internally generated funds and then estimated secured debt and new equity financing.&#13;
Specifically, external sources of funds, including both borrowings and equity contributions&#13;
are drawn as independent variables in order to bridge whatever financing gap may result&#13;
between the estimated capital expenditures and remaining cash available after debt service&#13;
and working capital obligations. As such, the model draws only those funds that may be&#13;
absolutely necessary to meet the needs of the project while still maintaining adequate&#13;
levels for working capital.&#13;
4.    Annual cash surpluses are initially reinvested in short-term deposits earning a&#13;
minimal rate of return. Cash deficits that may result in any given year during the projected&#13;
period, would be financed, first by the sale of excess short-term deposits or other current&#13;
assets while still maintaining an appropriate level of current assets to meet ongoing&#13;
working capital requirements. Unidentified debt financing is not considered an option for&#13;
meeting shortfalls in cash during the latter years of the projection period. Therefore, new&#13;
equity contributions are regarded as the only final source of financing year-end shortfalls&#13;
of cash. However, since these additional equity contributions may not necessarily be&#13;
identified or assumed at the outset of this assessment, other assumptions such as, scaling&#13;
down or extending the program are revised first in order to derive a workable solution. If,&#13;
on the other hand, there is absolutely no conceivable way to achieve this and still retain the&#13;
integrity of the proposed project, it would therefore be necessary to assume contributions&#13;
of additional equity that would necessarily be agreed with the project sponsor and the&#13;
Government. If this cannot be accomplished satisfactorily, while maintaining a healthy&#13;
financial position, major revisions in the program would then need to be seriously&#13;
considered.&#13;
1.   Significant Accounting Principles&#13;
5.    The PPWSA and SWSA follow conventional accounting principles and standards&#13;
similar to other commercial utilities. However, accounting for SWSA will need to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
115&#13;
strengthen considerably for consistency and reliability. Accounting is done on an accrual&#13;
basis, and standard commercial procedures are utilized for the accounting of revenues and&#13;
expenses as well as fixed assets and debt obligations. During the review, several accounts&#13;
of PPWSA were still undergoing a process of reconciliation as part of the corporatization&#13;
of the water utility. These involved particularly the reconciliation of inter-governmental&#13;
trade accounts such as trade receivables and payables, as well as determination of&#13;
outstanding debt obligations which may or may not be left with the utility for debt&#13;
repayment. In the past, both PPWSA and SWSA had been holding excessive working&#13;
capital in the form of inventories, liquid funds, and receivables and had also lagged&#13;
significantly in making timely payments to suppliers, particularly Electricite' de Combodge&#13;
and other Government agencies. These practices stem in part from lack of financial&#13;
autonomy of either authority, and the related uncertainties of not having full control of the&#13;
enterprise's financial flows. With the implementation of the decree which corporatizes the&#13;
PPWSA, greater financial autonomy will be granted to the authority for undertaking&#13;
reasonable commercial and financial management practices. On the other hand, it is&#13;
anticipated that SWSA will continue to function essentially as a department of MIME&#13;
even though the accounts can be fully separated as it were functioning as a financially&#13;
autonomous entity.&#13;
2.    Assumptions to the Financial Proiections&#13;
a) General Projection Parameters&#13;
-  Projection Period. For projection purposes the total project period is&#13;
approximately 13 years, starting 1998 as the first projection year.&#13;
-  Currency. Riels in millions.&#13;
-  Exchange Rate. An exchange rate of 3,400 Riels to US$ 1.00 was&#13;
utilized.&#13;
-  Price and Cost Escalation Rates. Projections of both revenue and&#13;
expense items were made in current terms.&#13;
-  Income and Other Taxes. The water authorities are currently exempt&#13;
from income taxes. However, new policies from the Government&#13;
concerning PPWSA's tax liability are in the process of being&#13;
developed. The Ministry of Finance is also in the process of applying a&#13;
1% turnover tax which for projection purposes it is assumed that&#13;
PPWSA would pass on to its customers.&#13;
- Depreciation. For projection purposes, fixed assets are depreciated&#13;
based on a schedule of 65 years for PPWSA and 40 years for SWSA&#13;
once they are placed in service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116&#13;
b)     Key Operating Assumptions&#13;
Key operating assumptions are presented in the table below.&#13;

6.     Revenues. PPWSA Water realize their revenues purely from water sales based on&#13;
usage, and commodity and installation charges. In addition, each water authority realize&#13;
other earnings from interests on short-term deposits. Summarized below are important&#13;
assumptions concerning the derivation of projected revenues.&#13;
7.     Water Production Capacity. Presently, PPWSA generates all its water capacity&#13;
from the surface water of the Mekong River. Current pumping capacity is approximately&#13;
40.15 million cubic meters annually and production is at almost at this peak, given the&#13;
current installed technical capacity of the plant and the high volume of unaccounted for&#13;
water, which in 1995 was more than 60% of total water production. The proposed&#13;
project which will add to the pumping capacity another 23.7 million cubic meter of&#13;
critically needed water supply to the system.&#13;
8.     SWSA has a installed water supply capacity of 800,000 cubic meters annually.&#13;
The project will expand total water supply to 2.14 million cubic meters annually.&#13;
9.     Service Connection Program.  Since both PPWSA and SWSA currently cover a&#13;
very small percentage of the total population, limitation to water supply and distribution&#13;
were based solely on the technical water production capacity as well as the ability of the&#13;
water authority to actually connect new customers. As such, a five year connection&#13;
program formed the foundation for driving water sales projections. Opening active&#13;
connections for year-end 1997 for PPWSA and SWSA were respectively, 34,000 and 868.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
117&#13;
Over the five year period it is projected that these would increase to 90,397 for PPWSA&#13;
and 2,329 for SWSA.&#13;
9.    Water Losses. Water losses were divided into two categories: (i) technical losses&#13;
arising through seepage during distribution; and (ii) unaccounted non-technical losses&#13;
arising mostly through theft or improper commercial practices. This differentiation is&#13;
important because on the technical side, such losses affect mostly operating costs, while&#13;
non-technical losses affect mostly the revenue side of the operation. Together however,&#13;
they are factored to estimate the actual annual water production that is needed to equate&#13;
to the water sales derived by the projected consumption, which in turn is derived by the&#13;
programmed installation of new service connections. PPWSA has had substantial&#13;
problems with unaccounted for water, at more than 80% only several years ago. More&#13;
recently measures have been taken to reduce sharply both technical and non-technical&#13;
losses and at year end 1997, unaccounted for water had already been reduced to 57%. It&#13;
is anticipated with the additional interventions water losses will continue to decline over&#13;
the 5-year investment program period to approximately 42% in year 2001.&#13;
10.   SWSA's water losses are significantly lower, averaging about 28% and less during&#13;
1997 and prior years. It is anticipated with new investments and stricter controls that&#13;
there losses can be reduced to 18% by the year 2000.&#13;
11.   Water Sales TanffStructure  Water sales are projected based on a tariff&#13;
structure that, with few exceptions consists of the parts: (i) usage charges by type of&#13;
customer (ie. residential or commercial); and (ii) an installation charge. Both the&#13;
PPWSA and SWSA have recently implemented new tariff increases which are designed to&#13;
fully recover costs. Such tariff levels however, will need to be periodically adjusted to&#13;
stay at pace with inflation as it affects the cost of doing business.&#13;
12.   Discountsfor On-Time Payment and Penalties and Fines. Either authority does&#13;
not apply either discounts for on-time payments nor penalties and fines on overdue&#13;
accounts.&#13;
13.   Sewerage Operations. No sewerage operations are contemplated at this time.&#13;
c)    Operating Expenses&#13;
14.   Power, chemicals and labor comprise the major operating cost elements for the&#13;
supply and distribution of water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
118&#13;
15.   Power. Power is required for pumping for surface water and for distributing it&#13;
through the network. The kilowatt requirement for PPWSA per cubic meter of water is&#13;
estimated at a constant .23 at a cost per kilowatt of 353 Riels based on historical&#13;
experience. SWSA's power costs are significantly highly due to the need to pump surface&#13;
water to a high elevation where the treatment plant is situated. In turn the kilowatt&#13;
requirement for SWSA per cubic meter of water is estimated from .83 to .77 at a cost per&#13;
kilowatt of 550 Riels based on historical experience.&#13;
16.   Chemicals. Alum, Chlorine and Lime are the primary chemical s used for&#13;
treatment. Based on historical usage an average .03 52 tons of a mix of these chemicals is&#13;
required per cubic meter of water at an average cost ranging from 428,000 Riels per ton&#13;
to 1.05 million Riels per ton. In addition, chemical requirements are also applied a 17%&#13;
factor on total water production.&#13;
17.   Transportation &amp; Equipment. This cost item represent primarily fuel costs for&#13;
vehicles servicing the system which are estimated for both authorities at approximately&#13;
one vehicle per 1200 service connections. Fuel and maintenance costs per are estimated at&#13;
7,000 Riels per vehicle.&#13;
18.   Maintenance Materials and Expenses. These expenses are based on 3% of the&#13;
net assets values of the SWSA plant and 1% for PPWSA. The difference stems primarily&#13;
from the fact that PPSWA has revalued its fixed assets while SWSA has not. Once, the&#13;
new investments come on stream for SWSA at the more current costs, the assumption for&#13;
maintenance will also drop to 1% of net fixed assets.&#13;
19.   Labor Costs. Operational labor expenses are estimated based on a ratio of&#13;
operational employees to service connections which are estimated for PPWSA and SWSA&#13;
based on historical their respective performance of 106 and 24 service connections per&#13;
employee. However, over the five-year investment program period operational&#13;
improvement should allow for greater efficiency of personnel thus increasing for both&#13;
authorities allowing them to increase the connections per required employees.&#13;
20.   General &amp; Administration Expenses. These expenses are estimated based on 825&#13;
Riels annually per employee of SWSA and 3,700 Riels per employee for PPWSA, based&#13;
on past experience.&#13;
21.   Other Operating Expenses. This expense category includes other operating&#13;
expenses and miscellaneous items which have not been specifically identified and are&#13;
estimated at 2,000 Riels annually per service connection for SWSA and 3,200 Riels per&#13;
connection for PPWSA.&#13;

water authority made up of a series of projects to be financed by IDA the ADB as well as&#13;
other donor agencies. These include:&#13;

            Cambodia - Urban Water Supply Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Urban Water Supply Project seeks to:
            a) improve drinking water coverage, quality and access in
            Cambodia's two biggest cities; b) improve the
            performance of the water utilities in these cities; c)
            enhance availability of water for commercial and industrial
            purposes in these two cities as a spur to economic growth
            and as a means of ensuring viability of the utilities; and
            d) help the Government develop and implement an investment
            program based on a well-articulated water and sanitation
            sector policy framework.  The project consists of three
            components: 1) Augmentation of water supply in Phnom Penh
            will be done through rehabilitation and extension of the
            Chruoy Chang War water treatment plant; supply of pipes,
            ancillary equipment and leak detection equipment; and
            technical assistance.  2) Augmentation of water supply in
            Sihanoukville will be done by raising the outlet weir and
            sealing off the sand spit to increase the storage of raw
            water; constructing four new groundwater wells; and
            improving distribution system.  3) Assistance to develop a
            water and sanitary policy framework for the sector as a
            whole will be provided through financing of consulting services.
