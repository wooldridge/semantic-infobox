Volume 1, Summary of Intemational Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns and Multi-village Schemes|&#13;
FOREWORD&#13;
Small towns are important to policy makers and water and sanitation professionals for two basic reasons; (i) they&#13;
account for a growing share of the people that have no access to safe water and decent sanitation; and (ii) we&#13;
know little about how to meet their demand for improved water and sanitation services.&#13;
In fact, a large part of the Millennium Development Goals for water and sanitation will have to be met in small&#13;
towns and sector professionals and national policy makers need more practical information on management&#13;
model and professional support options that have proved effective, and a better understanding of other key&#13;
ingredients for successful town water and sanitation services.&#13;
In 1999, the World Bank's Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) Thematic Group, in collaboration with the&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), launched a global small towns initiative to study and document innovative&#13;
management models that provide good quality, affordable services that are sustainable and can be expanded to&#13;
meet demand. This effort lead to simultaneous E-Conferences on Small Town WSS held in 2000 which were&#13;
sponsored by the Water, Engineering and Development Centre (WEDC) of the University of Loughborough and&#13;
One World and facilitated by Cinara in Latin America and the World Bank. The E-Conferences attracted a large&#13;
number of participants from all over the world, who shared a wealth of information about local initiatives aimed&#13;
at improving water services in small towns.&#13;
Other institutions and programs such as Programme Solidaritee-Eau (PS-EAU), the Delft International Institute for&#13;
Infrastructural, Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering International Reference Centre (IHE-IRC) and WEDC&#13;
also established their own programs and projects to learn more about small town water supply and saniation. In&#13;
fact, the Addis Conferencefollows a number of previous workshops, such as those organized in 2001 by PS-Eau in&#13;
Nouakshott and byWEDC in Lusaka.&#13;
It has became clear that a better understanding of small town WSS must be learned form the ground up by&#13;
sharing experience and finding out what works. This was the goal that we set ourselves in Addis Ababa, when&#13;
more than 200 practitioners had the opportunity to review 30 case studies, over 40 posters, and especially to&#13;
share their experience and their vision through the many working groups organized during the conference.&#13;
The Conference proceedings are structured as follows:&#13;
1. The Conference Statement attempts to capture the broad lines of shared understanding developed through&#13;
the presentations and the exchanges.&#13;
2. Volume 1 Conference Summary, is meant for broad circulation (in print as well as electronically) in French and&#13;
in English and expands on the Statement, including selected annexes on special sessions, participant feedback&#13;
and networking.&#13;
3. Volume 2 Presentations, includes the complete set of presentations made in plenary and in working groups. It&#13;
will be made available electronically to all the participants, and will also be made accessible from the websites&#13;
of the organizers.&#13;
4. Volume 3 Posters, will be a compendium of the posters and will be distributed the same way as Volume 2.&#13;
The Bank sees dissemination of these proceedings as the first step in responding to the demand from of the Addis&#13;
Conference for further learning and networking on small town WSS services. We will be led by the&#13;
recommendations of the Conference in drawing up future research and pilot work on WSS services for small&#13;
towns. The Conference has strengthened our conviction that it is learning and sharing knowledge as partners, we&#13;
will be better able to pursue our common vision of a world where everyone has access to safe water and hygienic&#13;
sanitation.&#13;

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS&#13;
The Small Towns Water Conference was made possible by the collaboration and support of many agencies and&#13;
thevision, the expertise and hard work of countless individuals including the organizers, and those responsiblefor&#13;
support and logistics. It was an exhibition of teamwork (session hosts, presenters, facilitators and rapporteurs)&#13;
drawn from the participants, all pitching in to organize and facilitate the complex sessions. Our objectives were&#13;
achieved: the towns water and sanitation crowd got to know each other, learned a lot, set an agenda, and had a&#13;
good time.&#13;
A first round of acknowledgement and thanks is due to the Government of Ethiopia that hosted the Conference&#13;
through the Ministry of Water Resources and to Ato Shiferaw Jarso, Minister for Water Resources and Jamal&#13;
Saghir, Director Energy and Water Department for their keynote addresses.&#13;

CONFERENCE STATEMENT&#13;
SMALL TOWNS, SPECIAL CHALLENGES&#13;
The Addis Ababa Conference on "Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) Services for Small Towns and Multi-Village&#13;
Schemes" was the first international meeting dedicated entirely to small town and multi-village schemes. This&#13;
Conference followed the first regional conferences on this topic sponsored by French Cooperation in&#13;
Ouagadougou in 1998 and in Nouakchott in 2001. The Conference drew more than 200 practitioners from all&#13;
continents; about 70% of them from Africa; and the majority with over 1 5 years of experience in water and&#13;
sanitation. The five-day Conference was hosted by the Government of Ethiopia through the Ministry of Water&#13;
Resources (MWR) and sponsored by the World Bank, the Water and Sanitation Program and the World Bank&#13;
Institute, as well as the UK Government and the Bank-Netherlands-Water-Partnership (BNWP).&#13;
Objectives and Expectations&#13;
The objectives and expectations for the conference were as follows:&#13;
* To share global experience, build a community of interested professionals, and start a knowledge network&#13;
focused on small town WSS&#13;
* To review and enrich our understanding of the ingredients forsuccess in small town water supply&#13;
* To better understand the needs of small towns for professional support and the options to access the&#13;
required financial and technical expertise&#13;
* To identifytools of the tradethat address professional support needs and build local capacity&#13;
* To build knowledge on key issues and approaches for the development of a sanitation strategy in small&#13;
towns&#13;
* To identify priorities for further learning, and to use the Addis Ababa conference as a launch pad for the&#13;
BNWP Town WSS Initiative which will provide recommendations and guidance to task managers and&#13;
governments concerned with small town WSS.&#13;
Ethiopia moving towards a Programmatic Approach to Water Sector Development&#13;
Addis Ababa provided an ideal backdrop to the conference. Water supply and sanitation is at the heart of&#13;
Ethiopia's development agenda, including over 600 small towns earmarked for improvement and extension of&#13;
WSS services. The sector strategy is based on decentralization and local cost recovery for urban systems. It&#13;
supports the shift to a programmatic approach to sector development.&#13;
Global Overview&#13;
The global consensus on the need to improve access to WSS services is reflected in two Millennium Development&#13;
Goals (MDG), namely: (a) by 201 5, to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking&#13;
water; and, (b) by 2020, to ensure that 100 million slum dwellers have access to improved sanitation. These are&#13;
daunting targets considering that 1.1 billion people are without access to safe drinking water and that 2.4 billion&#13;
do not have access to improved sanitation. The MDG's imply a 70% increase in annual investments from the&#13;
current average level of US$15 billion to US$25 billion. Business as usual will not do. Countries will have to find&#13;
new ways of mobilizing resources for the WSS sector in particular from the private sector. Equally important will&#13;
be measures to tackle gaps in knowledge, policies and capacity. The Addis Ababa conference provided an&#13;
opportunity to address these issues in the context of small towns.&#13;
1 -Summary of Conference&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Volume 1, Summary of International Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns and Multi-village Schemes&#13;
The Special Challenge of Small Towns&#13;
Sector planners, policy makers and communities face special challenges when it comes to WSS services for small&#13;
towns. Water supply systems for small towns can be characterized as follows:&#13;
* They are sufficiently large and dense to benefit from economies of scale and higher levels of services offered by&#13;
piped systems;&#13;
* The are too large and complex to be operated by communities;&#13;
* They are too small and dispersed to be profitably managed by a conventional urban water utility&#13;
* They "can't go it alone", and need specialized professional support in particular to train operators and to&#13;
prepare and update business plans, expansion programs and efficiency strategies.&#13;
As urbanization progresses, the number of small towns (ST; population of 3000 to 30,000) increases. Over the last&#13;
two decades the proportion of these towns without improved water services has doubled. As a rule small towns&#13;
have "fallen between the cracks" because they are neither an attractive market for urban utilities, nor are they&#13;
within the scope of interventions designed for rural communities. The strong demand for piped systems has led&#13;
local authorities, communities and private entrepreneurs to take initiatives to develop and manage such systems,&#13;
in many instances outside a formal policy framework.&#13;
The vast range of institutional models illustrated by the case studies reviewed by Conference showed the&#13;
resourcefulness of local actors as well as their limitations and the constraints under which they operate. ST&#13;
Management models fall into two main types:&#13;
* Direct management by local authorities or by communities employing their own staff; often a "default"&#13;
scenario; and,&#13;
* Delegated management to a professional operator either local or regional/national; with capacity&#13;
requirements and risks increasing with the scope of delegation and with the size of the systems.&#13;
The country cases also showed the range of strategies adopted by STs to access the expertise and the professional&#13;
support that they require, ranging from cost sharing to more formal aggregation whereby one operator is given&#13;
responsibilities for the WSS systems of a number of towns. Aggregation strategies also allow STs to strengthen&#13;
their bargaining powerwith suppliersand operators.&#13;
The great variety of approaches and the dynamism of local communities, acting on their own or in groups points&#13;
out the importance of: (i) learning from the emerging experience; and, (ii) adapting to local conditions and&#13;
capacities. Hence the importance of gaining a bottom-up understanding of what are the factors underpinning&#13;
successful water supply services for small towns.&#13;
The Ingredients for Success&#13;
Success for water supply and sanitation means&#13;
good quality, affordable and sustained services for all&#13;
The Conference reviewed and refined the findings of research concerning key ingredients for success for WSS&#13;
services in small towns. These are summarized below together with the outcome of the Conference deliberations&#13;
concerning the policies, practices and tools through which they can be developed and sustained:&#13;
1) Financial and managerial autonomy&#13;

AutonomyforSTWSS means:&#13;
- Control of operations (staffing, connection and disconnection, billing)&#13;
- Own bank account, ring fencing, no transfer to town budget;&#13;
- Tariffs set in light of local conditions;&#13;
- The flexibilityto adapt service level to demand;&#13;
- Ability to invest to adapt and develop system&#13;
Autonomy rests on: (i) financial viability; (ii) stakeholders support; (iii) protection from political interference&#13;
through community oversight.&#13;

2) Transparency and accountability&#13;
Transparency and accountability are critical to gain and maintain the trust of users and investors. They are&#13;
founded on: (i) clear roles and responsibilities; (ii) independent audit and monitoring; and, (iii) disclosure of&#13;
information. They are particularly important in situations where there is a monopoly in service provision.&#13;
Transparency and accountability are key to good governance but require good information flows and&#13;
consultation. Customers must be aware of their rights and oversight boards need the capacity and the&#13;
qualification to exert their responsibilities.&#13;
3) Professional support&#13;
Theneedforoutsideprofessionalsupportfortasksbeyond routinefunctionsisadefiningcharacteristicofSTWSS&#13;
systems. STs need professional support for: (i) training their own staff (or the staff of their small scale operator) in&#13;
routinefunctions; and, (ii) supporting non-routinefunctions: i.e. financial management, business planning, tariff&#13;
setting, expansion planning, efficiency improvement, trouble shooting and communication, customer relations.&#13;
Professional support comes at a price customers/community must be willing to support the additional costs.&#13;
Sharing of professional resources between neighboring towns results in economies of scale. Guidelines are&#13;
needed for procurement, and for establishing/regulating professional standards.&#13;
The three ingredients for success outlined above deal essentially with management and operational&#13;
responsibilities. They apply to the whole range of management models although they are much more easily&#13;
achieved and sustained in situations where the oversight function is clearly separated from day-to-day&#13;
management. Hence the trend for delegating system management to private professional operators through&#13;
contracts. Limitations include: (i) inability to attract competent operators; (ii) lack of capacity in drawing up and&#13;
regulating the contract; and, (iii) lackofcustomerconfidence.&#13;
The next two ingredients for success deal with the enabling environment for WSS services in STs.&#13;
4) Competition&#13;
Competition pushes prices down and quality up, fosters innovations, and builds capacity. STs offer a range of&#13;
opportunitiesfor local firms.&#13;
Competition for the market requires: (i) supportive legal and regulatory environment (open entry and minimum&#13;
restrictions on service areas); (ii) attractive contracts in scope, duration and size (through pooled procurement,&#13;
clustering and aggregation); and, (iii) a competitive procurement process.&#13;
Competition in the market can be fostered by: (i) alternative services (tankers, vendors, private standposts,&#13;
reselling); (ii) limited contractduration and re-bidding; (iii) supportto innovations; and, (iv) benchmarking.&#13;
5) Legal framework and regulation&#13;
As far as small towns are concerned the central purpose of national laws and regulations is to establish and&#13;
enforce "rules of the game" that foster fair and sustainable relationships among local actors. The challenge is to&#13;
translate policies into country-wide norms and regulations without stifling local initiatives.&#13;
A supportive legal framework is a necessary condition for the involvement of the private sector in operations and&#13;
financing. Laws are also needed to: (i) ensure stable access to water resources; (ii) to establish cost recovery&#13;
principles for water services; and (iii) to define regulatory mechanisms.&#13;
The primary focus of regulation is to reconcile the imperative of financial viability with the need to protect the&#13;
customers and to uphold quality standards. The regulatory functions for ST WSS services should focus on process&#13;
and guidelines for tariff setting and revisions (periodicity, information, consultations and recourse and&#13;
arbitration). Effective regulation is enhanced by: (i) community oversight; (ii) sound contracts and business plans;&#13;
(iii) open communication and consultation mechanisms; and, (iii) external auditing and benchmarking.&#13;
The build up of regulatory capacity for ST WSS should be approached with limited objectives as a response to&#13;
specific needs. The reasons for caution relate to the fact that: (i) regulation is costly and would ultimately be&#13;
supported by the users; and, (ii) in most countries, the concept of independent regulation is not yet well&#13;

established and would in any case be difficult to apply to a large number of small decentralized systems. Simple&#13;
contracts with professional operators in which responsibilities, payment terms and incentives are clearly set out,&#13;
underpin regulation, whether the operator is a private company or staff of the oversight body.&#13;
The next two ingredients for success cover services and system development.&#13;
6) Responding to the demand&#13;
Approaching ST WSS with the basic goal of offering services that customers want and are ready to pay for is a&#13;
powerful ingredient for success. At the system level demand responsive approaches lead to higher cost recovery&#13;
and internal cash generation ensuring sustainability and allowing further development. At the country/program&#13;
level demand responsiveness allows for more efficient use of public funds.&#13;
Interventions by governments/donors and NGOs, can foster demand responsiveness by (i) introducing flexibility&#13;
in: system design, technologies and service levels; (ii) empowering customers to make informed decisions&#13;
(services levels, costs); and, (iii) encouraging free entry and competition.&#13;
7) Incentives forexpansion&#13;
The operators of ST WSS systems are keen to develop their distribution network thereby adding customers and&#13;
increasing sales. The issue for planners is to ensure that the proper requisites are in place; essentially: (i) access to&#13;
adequate water resources; (ii) stable institutional/legal framework allowing fair return on investment; and, in&#13;
most situations, (iii) basic production and storage facilities built (or rehabilitated) with sufficient capacity.&#13;
Incentives and facilitating factors for system expansion include: (i) access to financing; (ii) limited administrative&#13;
controls (service area, certification focused on quality and safety); (iii) administrative and financial barriers to&#13;
house connections; and, (iv) incentives built into operator's contract.&#13;
Equity and services to low-income groups&#13;
Rising tides lift all boats. The first sectoral priority for poverty reduction is therefore to have efficient and&#13;
financiallyviablewater systems. Within this framework expansion and demand responsiveness will foster broader&#13;
access to services for the poor. The key point is to ensure that low-income households are recognized as&#13;
legitimate customers. Towns and cities would eventually require programs specifically directed at services for the&#13;
poor.&#13;
Access to services for poor households can be supported by: (i) providing an element of grant for the initial&#13;
investment so that tariffs remain affordable; (ii) pre-financing "social" connections; and, (iii) ensuring the poor&#13;
have a voice as stakeholders and customers.&#13;
Sanitation&#13;
The issue facing sanitation and public hygiene in small towns reflect the general state of sanitation in most&#13;
developing countries; i.e. lack of awareness and low demand; lackof policies and institutional leadership; and, no&#13;
financing.&#13;
It is when future cities are still small towns that incipient urban communities have the best opportunities to&#13;
establish shared expectations and land-use planning that will set them on the right environmental path. In order&#13;
to seize these opportunities small towns need:&#13;
* A Vision of a clean and healthy environment&#13;
* A Policy reflecting the attitudes needed to carry the vision, e.g. ART (Avoid, Reuse, and Treat waste) and, the&#13;
will to implement it through advocacy, clear institutional arrangements, standards, funding mechanisms and&#13;
enforcement capacity&#13;
* A Priority to mobilize communities and households to take initiatives that can make sanitation a reality and&#13;
evolve their own local strategy to pursue their vision of a clean and healthy city.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Volume l, Summary of International Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns and Multi-village Schemes&#13;
Guiding principles:&#13;
- Focus on sanitation services from the household's point of view,&#13;
- Achieve more effective advocacy through social marketing and health and hygiene promotion&#13;
- Make local authorities responsible for organizing sanitation and environmental services&#13;
- Set up funding mechanisms that reflect community and household responsibilities and ensure at least&#13;
recovery of O&amp;M.&#13;
- Foster opportunities for private sector initiatives.&#13;
Tools of the Trade&#13;
Toolsofthetradeaddress professionalsupport needs, and help build thecapacityof local service providers. They&#13;
also play a role in the implementation of sector policies and in investment decisions. The tools reviewed by the&#13;
Conferenceare outlined belowtogetherwith the key points arising from the debate.&#13;
The Cost Effective Design tools allow planners to test the cost recovery potential of water systems and provides&#13;
a basis to match system components and service levels to town size and affordable user charges.  It promotes&#13;
cost effective design and resulting financial viability.&#13;
The Business Planning (BP) tool is necessary to assess the financial viability of proposed investments and to&#13;
develop a financing plan consistent with the debt carrying capacity of the system and expansion requirements. A&#13;
sound business plan is essential for private sector participation (PPP) (performance targets, bid evaluation,&#13;
contract management) and for regulation and tariff reviews. The value of the BP process is that it treats the WSS&#13;
system as a whole focusing on the continuity of its operations. It avoids the shortcoming of the project driven&#13;
approach centered on the appraisal and funding of capital expenditure.&#13;
The Contingent Valuation Methodology (CVM) allows planners to assess the willingness to pay and provides&#13;
the necessary basis for projecting sales and revenues. This information is essential to support community&#13;
participation and enable "informed choice" at the household level as well as for the community as a whole. WTP&#13;
surveys provide the parameters to underpin financial models needed to evaluate expansion plans and to set&#13;
tariffs. The relative high cost of WTP tools is likely to come down as they are systematically applied and as the local&#13;
consulting profession build-up its capacity&#13;
The fourth tool, billing systems, is critical for sustainability and autonomy. They regiment billing and collection&#13;
functions, and underpin good customer relations and transparency.&#13;
The Conference stressed the critical role of tools of the trade to support improvements in WSS systems and to&#13;
translate general policy principles into practical guidelines. Tools need to be adapted to the context of each&#13;
cquntry. The dissemination and adaptation of the four tools reviewed and the development of additional tools&#13;
and guidance material should be given priority in thefollow-up to the Conference.&#13;
Contracting Options&#13;
As they expand and become more complex, ST WSS systems evolve from the so-called "default option" direct&#13;
public management or informal delegation (e.g. local Build-Own-Operate) towards contracting options and&#13;
management models under which "professional support" is provided with increasing levels of private sector&#13;
involvement in management and financing.&#13;
The unfolding worldwide movement toward PPP in the WSS sector has provided a growing body of knowledge&#13;
and lessons on which to develop an understanding of howto pursue PPPfor small townsWSS services.&#13;
The first point is that in orderto succeed PPP needs some prerequisites most importantly: commitment from all&#13;
stakeholders based on good communication of the changes that will be necessary to implement PPP. The choice&#13;
of contract has to rest on a realistic assessment of the local context against the prerequisites for success&#13;
corresponding to each option.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Volume 1, Summary of Intemational Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns and Multi-village Schemesi&#13;
The second point concerns the fact that designing a successful PSP transaction is essentially about understanding&#13;
risks, trying to reduce them and make sure that they are allocated in line with competence, capacity and ability to&#13;
control.&#13;
While the principle of private sector participation in the development and provision of WSS services is broadly&#13;
accepted, PPP could not be considered as the exclusive avenue for improved services. Most countries still lack the&#13;
legal framework, the regulatory capacity and the knowledge basis to benefit fully from PSP. Nonetheless, there is&#13;
no doubt that contracts with private operators introduce opportunities in the water sector for entrepreneurs to&#13;
make business in the water sector, and that this builds capacity. Contracts also introduce checks and balances&#13;
between the oversight body and the operator, introduce performance targets and incentives, promote&#13;
competition and resulting Improved efficiency and services at fair price.&#13;
As small town water systems follow the trend toward delegated management, it will be essential for policy&#13;
makers, planners as well as operators to develop their understanding of: (i) how best to structure the contractual&#13;
relationships between operators and small towns water board; and, (ii) options for developing the capacity of&#13;
oversight boards and local operators.&#13;
The Way Forward a "Change Process"&#13;
The Conference findings provide an initial basis to guide the broad range of actors involved in the development of&#13;
water and sanitation services for small towns and multi-village schemes.&#13;
The ingredients for success provide a useful framework to assess the performance of town water supply systems&#13;
and to identify their needs for professional support and to map options to foster efficiency and to support&#13;
continued expansion.&#13;
Public-private-partnerships introduce many advantages. Not least in building local business opportunities and&#13;
better career prospects. The challenge is to balance aggregation and delegation strategies with local&#13;
accountability.&#13;
Governments and their development partners should recognize that small towns and multi-village schemes&#13;
represent a special challenge and opportunities that necessitate development or adaptation of a supportive&#13;
policy, legal and regulatory frameworks as well as programs. Sector policies related to small towns must be broad&#13;
enough to allow a range of alternative management arrangements to emerge and evolve in response to local&#13;
demands and capacity.&#13;
The proper focus of programs for the development of WSS services for small towns would be to guide and&#13;
support local initiatives. The learning and piloting can be supported by "retail" projects dealing with a limited&#13;
number of towns, leading to a more systemic approach based on sector-wide programs better suited to deal with&#13;
institutional issues and financing mechanisms.&#13;
Priorities for further learning&#13;
Developing and improving ST WSS service should be approached as a learning process at all levels: communities,&#13;
country and global/regional, relying on case studies, models, good practices, tools and guidelines&#13;
The Conference stressed the need for further knowledge development and networking on issues related to WSS&#13;
services for ST with special attention to sanitation and to services for low-income groups and communities which&#13;
should be a guiding pre-occupation for all knowledge development activities.&#13;
In order to support the development and the evolution of ST WS systems, policy makers, planners as well as&#13;
operatorswill need to develop their understanding of:&#13;
-  How bestto structurethe contractual relationships between operators and small towns water board;&#13;
- How to foster aggregation and which aggregation models are best adapted to various situations and&#13;
categories of towns&#13;
- How to approach capacity building of oversight boards and local operators; and,&#13;
-  How to nu rture the emergence of specialized WSS enterprises.&#13;

They also need to learn more about the following specific issues: (i) tariff setting and cross subsidies, (ii)&#13;
household connection policies, (iii) financing and risk mitigation, (iv) regulation, and (v) water resource&#13;
management.&#13;
The Conference stressed the importance of networking (web-based activities, workshops, help-desk), help-desk,&#13;
training and databases. They specifically recommended a follow-up e-conference on ST WSS services in mid-&#13;
2003.&#13;
Participants from West Africa resolved to form a regional network during the Conference&#13;
The Government of the Netherlands has provided substantial financing through the Bank-Netherlands Water&#13;
Partnership to continue the town water and sanitation initiative. It will consolidate what we've learned in a user&#13;
friendly format, investigate aggregation from the perspective of towns and private operators, develop practical&#13;
tools of the trade that build capacity, assist selected cou ntries that are committed to building state of the art town&#13;
waterand sanitation programs, and disseminate information and supportcontinued consultation.&#13;
Concluding Statement&#13;
The Addis Conference resolved that the above findings and recommendations provide useful guidance to&#13;
recognizeand addressthespecial challengeof improving WSS servicesforsmall townsand multi-village systems.&#13;
The Conference mandated the organizersto disseminate its findings and recommendations to all actors engaged&#13;
in the water and sanitation sectors including knowledge organizations and development agencies as well as&#13;
organizations focused on local authorities.&#13;
The Conference mandated the organizing partnersto pursuethe learning agenda outlined aboveand to organize&#13;
within the next three years, i.e. by 2005, regional or global consultations on small towns WSS issues preferably in&#13;
partnership with organizations serving municipalities and local authorities. The BNWP town water initiative was&#13;
welcomed as an opportunity for further development of the ideas presented during the conference and the&#13;
priorities for further learning.&#13;
The Conference mandated the organizers to express the gratitude of all the participants to the Government of&#13;
Ethiopia and in particular to H.E Ato Shiferaw Jarso and the staff of the Ministry of Water Resources, for hosting&#13;
the Conference. The Conference thanks the organizers and the supporting partners for their initiative and for the&#13;
good conduct of the proceedings.&#13;

SESSION 1 Conference Opening                                      Day 1 PM June 11, 2002&#13;
The Addis Ababa Conference on "Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) Services for Small Towns and Multi-Village&#13;
Schemes" was the first international meeting dedicated entirely to small towns and multi-village schemes. The&#13;
Conference drew more than 200 practitioners from all continents; about 70% of them from Africa; and the&#13;
majority with over 15 years of experience in water and sanitation. The five-day Conference was hosted by the&#13;
Government of Ethiopia through the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) and sponsored by the World Bank, the&#13;
World Bank Institute and the Water and Sanitation Program, as well as the UK Government and the Bank-&#13;
Netherlands-Water-Partnership (BNWP).&#13;
Objectives and Expectations&#13;
The goal of the Addis Conference was to provide water and sanitation specialists with the unique perspective&#13;
needed to meet the challenge of improved WSS services for small towns and to share experience on a global basis.&#13;
Letitia Obeng, Sector Manager for Water, Sanitation and Urban Development in the Africa Region of the World&#13;
Bank, and the host of the Conference, pointed out that the Addis Conference was conceived as a starting point for&#13;
building a professional network and a community of practice focused on water and sanitation services for small&#13;
towns. The Addis Conference follows simultaneous email conferences on small town water and sanitation in&#13;
2000 hosted by WEDC and One World and facilitated by CINARA in Latin America and the World Bank. and&#13;
previous workshops in WestAfrica (Nouakchott) organized by PS Eau in 2001.&#13;
Box 1: Conference objectives              The fast growing body of applied research and policy analysis&#13;

small town wSs                         for further learning in particular on sanitation, which was the&#13;
object of a special session.&#13;
The above objectives were very much in line with participants' expectations that consistently stressed exchange of&#13;
experience, networking and learning about success factors, management models, PSP and financing. Equity and&#13;
sanitation also got significant support in particular from Francophone respondents.&#13;
The participants' feedback, which is reviewed in more detail in a subsequent section, suggests that these&#13;
expectations were largely met. In fact, a group of participants from West Africa resolved to form a regional&#13;
network during the Conference (Annex 7).&#13;

Ethiopia moving from Policies to Sector Programs&#13;
H.E. Ato ShiferawJarso, Minister of Water Resources of Ethiopia, in his opening speech stressed that water supply&#13;
and sanitation is at the heart of Ethiopia development challenge. Only about 31% of Ethiopia's population has&#13;
access to safe drinking water and less than 10% have access to improved sanitation. The Government has&#13;
launched profound reform of the water sector, as the conventional strategies will not do. Ethiopia's new water&#13;
sector policy is based on decentralization, local empowerment and building of technical as well as institutional&#13;
capacity. It recognizes the imperative of cost recovery and delegates service provision to local entities at the level&#13;
of municipalities, small towns and rural communities. Poverty is the biggest hurdle to sustainability. Lack of access&#13;
to safe drinking water and hygienic sanitation in small towns and villages contributes to poverty as it leads to poor&#13;
health and affect productivity. The Government has made water sector development a national priority. The&#13;
sector strategy will guide preparation of sector development programs.&#13;

In terms of water supply, small towns are:&#13;
* Sufficiently large and dense to benefit from economies of    Box4: WhatsaTown WaterSupply?&#13;
scale and demand for higher levels of services offered by   ?-iZ onomies of scale = piped&#13;

* Complex enough to require formal management and                 communities&#13;

* But too small to support the full complement of competence      facilities.&#13;
needed to operate efficiently and to finance their expansion.&#13;
* And also too small and dispersed to be profitably managed&#13;
by a conventional urban water utility.&#13;
In the context of decentralization and local empowerment, communities, local authorities and private&#13;
entrepreneurs have taken initiatives to manage and develop water supply services in small towns. In many&#13;
countries, e.g. Senegal, Benin, Mali and Vietnam, the number of water supply systems serving small towns has&#13;
increased rapidly over the last decade (Box 5). These developments have often taken place outside of any formal&#13;
policy framework.&#13;
Local initiatives have lead to a variety of arrangements of  Box 5: Growth of Small Water Supply&#13;
which the most prevalent are: (a) direct public management;  Network&#13;
(b) direct community management through user associations    The number of small water scheme in Senegal&#13;
or water boards; and, (c) informal build-own-operate (BOO)   rose very quickly during the last 20 years. Most&#13;
with  a private constructor-operator without a formal        of them are supplying a small town + some&#13;
contract. These default options have emerged in a weak       villages&#13;
regulatory and legal environment or when local authorities           Smal piped systems funded by&#13;
interpret their responsibility to organize water services as a  1200   administration in Senegal&#13;
mandate for direct provision.                                 1000&#13;

Many of these local initiatives have yielded positive results and  600&#13;
offer rich grounds for learning but they lack the enabling    400                          _&#13;
environment to ensure their sustainability and to allow their  200&#13;
continued expansion. Inabilities to access professional skills  0&#13;
and precarious governance structure have been recurring&#13;
weaknesses. Therefore, the challenge of WSS services for     The number of small water scheme in Benin&#13;
small towns is above all one of guiding and supporting the   roseveryquicklyduringthelast5years&#13;

SESSION 2 Success Factors                                       Day 2 AM June 12, 2002&#13;
One of the objectives of conference was to review and enrich our understanding of the ingredients for success in&#13;
small town water supply and sanitation. In considering ingredients for success, it is important to specify what we&#13;
mean by "success". This is generally taken to be, in terms of water supply and sanitation, a good quality,&#13;
affordable servicethat is technically and financially sustainable and accessible to all.&#13;
Mr. Bernard Collignon, Director of Hydroconseil, presented key ingredients for success in Small Towns (ST) WS.&#13;
His presentation was based on case studies (500 small towns) from Latin America, Africa, and South and East&#13;
Asia.&#13;
Fourteen breakout groups reviewed the seven key ingredients for success proposed by Mr. Collignon considering&#13;
relevant case studies as well as their own insights and experience. The groups generally validated the choice of&#13;
ingredients. The group reports suggest that given the wealth and diversity in the local experience in ST WSS, the&#13;
"empirical approach" based on learning what works by observation and analysis of real existing systems was&#13;
founded well justified and fruitful. The groups also suggested a number of other success factors that they felt&#13;
were important. Feedback from the groups indicates a strong interdependence between key ingredients.&#13;
The group findings are synthesized hereafter. The case studies are assembled in Volume 2. The matrix of cases is&#13;
presented after the summary of Session 3 concerning: professional support and aggregation.&#13;
1) Financial and managerial autonomy&#13;
Financialandmanagerialautonomyisessentialtoencourageentrepreneurshipand(re)investment:&#13;
* What autonomy means for ST WSS systems:&#13;
- Control of staff (numbers, hiring/firing);&#13;
- Own bankaccount, ring fencing, no transferto town budget;&#13;
- Tariffs set in light of local conditions;&#13;
- Ability to disconnect defaulting customers (including public offices);&#13;
- Theflexibilityto adapt service level to demand;&#13;
- Abilityto reinvest revenuesto expand and renewthe system.&#13;
* Howto establish and maintain autonomyforSTWSS systems:&#13;
-  Bydesigning system to befinanciallyviable&#13;
-  By building supportamong all stakeholdersforthe principles of autonomy&#13;
- By building the professional competence of the service provider&#13;
-  Byensuring protection from political interferencethrough community oversight&#13;
- Through user oversight and independent auditing&#13;
Autonomy needs to be backed up with a supportive legal, policy and regulatory environment, including&#13;
appropriate contracting options.&#13;
2) Transparency and accountability&#13;
Transparency and accountability are critical to gain and maintain support of users, communities and investors.&#13;

Volume 1, Summary of Intemational Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns and Multi-village Schemes&#13;
What else is needed to make sure that transparency and accountability contribute to good governance and&#13;
trust in STWSS:&#13;
-    Communication to all stakeholders and related training/education&#13;
-    Customer relations and recourse mechanism&#13;
-    Capacity building and qualification of members of oversight board&#13;
-    Broad consultation process especially for tariff revisions&#13;
-    Country level monitoring/benchmarking framework&#13;
-    Access to third partyadvise&#13;
-    By-laws and reporting tools for small town water boards&#13;
-    Contracts that set out the performance requirements and payment/incentives terms for operator&#13;
Transparency and accountability are needed to ensure that benefits reach all stakeholders. They are particularly&#13;
important where revenue/profits are large, or there is a monopoly on service provision. They are key to good&#13;
governance, and require good information flow and consultation between all stakeholders customers must be&#13;
aware of their rights to information. Decentralization, rules and regulations and clear ownership help&#13;
transparency. Transparency and accountability are necessary for contract supervision and the related monitoring&#13;
and documentation measures should be included in the contract.&#13;
3)   Professional support.&#13;
Local, small-scale operators can perform routine tasks&#13;
well, but specialist technical and financial skills are         Box 6: Professional Support&#13;
needed for more complex tasks. This "professional&#13;
support"   can  be  accessed   in two   ways: (i)           Routine Operations  Specialist Skills&#13;
supplemental professional support is provided to            -Meter reading     * Financial mgttraining&#13;
local, small-scale   operators    (e.g. through                in&#13;
retainer/service contracts, from  NGOs or regional&#13;
associations, etc.), or (ii) a more experienced operator    * Revenue collection  * Tariff setting&#13;
is contracted who has most of the necessary skills.         *Accounting        * Customer relations&#13;
Sharing   of professional resources     between             -Routine O&amp;M       *Technicaltraining&#13;
neighboring towns results in economies of scale.        X      H&#13;
.:   *House connections  * Expansion planning&#13;
Professional support comes at a price customers must        * Stores           * Problem solving&#13;
be aware of the costs and benefits, and be willing to  -                       * Efficiency improvement&#13;
support the additional costs to attract and keep&#13;
qualified staff/support.&#13;
Points to watch:&#13;
- WSS system managers reluctant to call in the experts; "professionalism is to know the value of expertise&#13;
and to seek help when needed"&#13;
- Needs related to longer-term objectives tend to get low priority in particular HRD, institutional&#13;
development, financial planning, etc.&#13;
- Training and capacity building of oversight board is frequently overlooked (financial strategy, review of&#13;
audit reports, good governance practice etc)&#13;
- Ditto for communication and customer relation functions.&#13;
Investment in human resources is critical for sustainability, and where possible must entail capacity building to&#13;
match demand and use of local people/skills.&#13;
*   How to build country capacity forprofessionalsupport:&#13;
- Develop/adapt and disseminate tools of the trade: business planning, cost effective design, tariff setting&#13;
&amp; review process, billing etc.&#13;
- Build-up country level knowledge network including an information clearinghouse with information on&#13;
where/who to access needed professional support) and on sources of support, tools, good practices etc,&#13;
- Develop guidelines for procurement of professional support and for regulating professional standards.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Volume 1, Summary of International Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns and Multi-village Schemes&#13;
The three ingredients for of success outlined above dealt essentially with management and operational&#13;
responsibilities. They apply to the whole range of management models although they are much more easily&#13;
achieved and sustained in situations where the oversight function is clearly separated from day-to-day&#13;
management. Hence the trend for delegating system management to private professional operators through&#13;
contracts.&#13;
Delegated management has a number of advantages over direct        Box 7: Management Types&#13;
management: management oversight is separated from day to&#13;
day management and operations leading to increased autonomy,    Direct Management  Delegated Management&#13;
autonomy introduces flexibility and (under contracts) incentives   Ownership        Ownership&#13;
to meet demand including expansion, delegation introduces          Oversight         Oversight&#13;
specialist technical and  financial skills and  competition.&#13;
Limitations include: attracting competent operators, lack of       Operations          | Contract&#13;
capacity in drawing up and regulating the contract, and the need&#13;
for transparency  and   accountability to  build  customer          Staff           Operator&#13;
confidence.&#13;
The next two ingredient of success deal mostly the institutional and regulatory framework related to the water&#13;
sectorand more generallyto business practices.&#13;
4) Competition&#13;
Competition keeps prices down, brings quality up and fosters innovations.&#13;
Competition is much easier in the electricity sector but is starting to emerge the water sector as well (see the case&#13;
of Aguateros in Paraguay). The notion that there is a natural monopoly in distribution of water supply is becoming&#13;
open to question.&#13;
Although network-based water supply systems serving small towns share some of the "natural monopoly&#13;
characteristics" of urban water utilities, they are more amenable to competition. Since small town systems are&#13;
more numerous and less complex they offer a range of opportunities for local firms. The large ranges of sizes of&#13;
small towns found in most countries, and the extent to which they are clustered together, creates multiple market&#13;
niches attractive to different sizes/types of operators.&#13;
Small towns must represent an attractive market to service providers if there is to be competition for the market.&#13;
Competition will tend to increase with the size of the business (the customer/revenue base). Design, build and&#13;
operate is an option to attract construction firms and enlarge the scope of the contract. Regional clustering of&#13;
small towns is an option to attract large operator.&#13;
*   What is needed to get competition for the market&#13;
- Attractive contracts correspond ing by its scope and size, to the interests of sufficient nu mber of bidders.&#13;
- Supportive legal and regulatory environmentforthe water sector as well as for business in general&#13;
- Contract duration long enough to allow recovery of investments, but as short as possible to maintain the&#13;
prospect of future competition&#13;
- Competitive procurement process, open entry policy creates business opportunities&#13;
- Capacity building for contract development and review and for bid preparation&#13;
*   How to maintain competition in the market:&#13;
- Open entry policy and minimum restrictions on service area&#13;
- Specific provision allowing alternative services in services areas of piped systems: tankers, vendors, private&#13;
standposts, resale etc.&#13;
- Competitive procurement of supplies and services&#13;
- Pooled procurement regrou ping the orders of several towns&#13;
- Benchmarking&#13;
- Supportto innovations&#13;

5) Legal framework and regulation&#13;
As far as small towns are concerned the central purpose of national laws and regulations is to establish and&#13;
enforce "rules of the game" that foster fair and sustainable relationships among local actors. Many countries face&#13;
the task of reforming or adapting existing policies and regulations in line with a better understanding of the&#13;
ingredients for success in ST WSS services. The challenge is to translate policies into country-wide norms and&#13;
regulations without stifling local initiatives.&#13;
Where are policies and laws needed:&#13;
-  To ensu re sta ble access to a nd protection of water resou rces&#13;
-  To leg iti mize the role of localI actors i n ST WSS services&#13;
-  To establish a framework for delegated management and for the involvement of the private sector in&#13;
operations and financing&#13;
-  To establish cost recovery principle&#13;
-  To define regulatory mechanisms&#13;
Regulation is important to allow tariffs to be raised while protecting the customer, and to provide security to the&#13;
service provider for investment and expansion, and finally to establish and enforce minimum quality standards.&#13;
Effective regulation requires regulatory capacity/regulatory tools. Options include:&#13;
-  Regulator&#13;
- Contracts&#13;
-  Pressure groups (accountability, transparency and equitable service provision are important)&#13;
-  Competition&#13;
-  Benchmarking&#13;
Centralized regulation may not be, sensitive to local needs, but there must be capacity to regulate at the lower&#13;
level. The regulatory functions for small towns WSS should focus not so much on outcomes but on process and&#13;
guidelines for tariff setting and revisions covering in particular: schedule/periodicity, stakeholders consultations,&#13;
information and disclosure requirements as well as recourse and arbitration mechanisms.&#13;
Several factors contribute to the effective regulation of the relationship between service providers and&#13;
customers in ST&#13;
-  Proximity and direct community&#13;
oversight is at play in towns of    Box 8: Mauritania - Institutional framework Up to 2001 for&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Volume 1, Summary of International Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns and Multi-village Schemes&#13;
It is clearmuch has to be learned on the regulation of WSS services in small towns. Key issues include: tariff setting&#13;
and regulation; how to enhance competition (when awarding the contract and during contract)? How to finance&#13;
a professional regulatory body or regulation processes? What is the difference between large and small towns&#13;
when it comes to regulation? What are the objectives of regulation in sanitation (especially liquid waste&#13;
management)?&#13;
On thewholethe cases reviewed by the Conference suggest that local actors seem on the wholeto be able to deal&#13;
with tariff matters. The build up of regulatory capacity for ST WSS should be approached with limited objectives&#13;
as a response to specific needs. The reasons for caution relate to the facts that: (i) regulation is costly and would&#13;
ultimately be supported by the users; and, (ii) the concept of independent regulation is not yet well established&#13;
and would at any case bedifficultto apply to a large number of small decentralized systems.&#13;
The next two ingredients for success cover services and system development.&#13;
6) Responding to the demand.&#13;
Approaching ST WSS with the basic goal of offering services that customers want and are ready to pay for is a&#13;
powerful ingredient for success. At the system level demand responsive approaches leads to higher cost recovery&#13;
andinternalcashgenerationensuringsustainabilityandallowingfurtherdevelopment. Atthecountry/program&#13;
level demand responsive allows for more efficient use of publicfunds.&#13;
*   How to make public interventions (bygovernments/donorsand NGO's) responsive to local demand:&#13;
- By allowing flexibility in system design so that service standards can be set in light of local conditions and&#13;
based on appropriate technologies. Standards should focus on water quality.&#13;
- By enabling customers to make informed decisions based on costs and service levels through&#13;
consultations concerning their preference and theirwillingnessto pay.&#13;
- Opening thefield to local initiatives bylimiting the obstaclestofreeentryand competition.&#13;
7) Incentives forexpansion&#13;
The case studies show that once the basic facilities (production and storage) are in place, the operators of small&#13;
towns water systems are keen to develop their distribution network, thereby adding customers and increasing&#13;
sales. The issue for planners is to ensure that the proper conditions and the right incentives are in place.&#13;
*   Conditions forsystem expansion:&#13;
- Secureaccesstosufficientwaterresourcewithinthecountrywaterresourcemanagementframework&#13;
- Supportive legal/policyframeworkallowing fair return on investment&#13;
- Confidence in the stability of institutional arrangements&#13;
- Basic production and storage facilities built (or rehabilitated) with sufficient capacity&#13;
Incentives for expansion are necessary to meet future demand and improve existing service levels, and to ensure&#13;
that all sections of the society, poor and non-poor, are served. High one-time connection costs are a disincentive&#13;
for many households. Sanitation requires special attention regarding public awareness campaigns linked to&#13;
demand creation, and affordableoptions.&#13;
* Incentives and facilitating factors:&#13;
- Access to financing in particularfor household connections&#13;
- Pre-financing of private connections by the operator and payment in monthly installments&#13;
- Li m ited regu latory or ad m inistrative restriction on service a rea&#13;
- Freedom of initiative with limited approval requirements focused on quality and safety&#13;
- Access to expertise and capacity for business pla nning and management&#13;
- I ncentives for expansion built in operator's contract&#13;
- Output based-aid to encourage expansion into less profitable areas&#13;
A number of cases reviewed by the Conference, in particular Senegal, Niger, Colombia and also USA, showed that&#13;
some element of grant financing for the construction or re-habilitation of basic production facilities (production,&#13;
bulk transport and storage) combined with autonomous management were essential to triggerthe development&#13;
of the distribution system and the expansion of services. They concluded that full cost recovery was not feasible&#13;
fortowns below a certain threshold.&#13;

An 8th factor?&#13;
Each of the breakout groups made suggestions for other ingredients for success that they felt were important.&#13;
These are grouped below, under "secondary factors" that are synonymous with or depend on one of the existing&#13;
seven factors, and issues for further discussion.&#13;
Secondary factors:&#13;
- Flexibilityto innovate depends on autonomy and demand responsiveness.&#13;
- Pro-poor policy depends on incentives to expand and demand responsiveness.&#13;
- Cost effective design/standards depends on demand responsiveness.&#13;
- Beneficiary participation synonymous with demand responsiveness.&#13;
- Capacityinsupplyofgoodsandservices synonymouswithprofessionalsupport.&#13;
- Performance monitoring and evaluation linked to transparency and accountability.&#13;
- Political push for newsolutions and changing culture of dependence on the state, were felt to be aspects&#13;
of a process of sector reform to which the conference contributes a fresh perspective.&#13;
Equity and services to low-income groups&#13;
The pattern suggested by case studies is that poor households do indeed access services from small town water&#13;
supply systems by sharing one connection among several households, by buying water from other households&#13;
with individual connection or through standposts. The latter tend to disappear as the proportion of households&#13;
with yard or house connections increases.&#13;
Issues related to equity and services to low-income groups and communities received considerable attention&#13;
throughout the debate and were specifically addressed in most of the cases and thematic presentations. In most&#13;
countries poverty is prevalent in small towns and villages, therefore programs that target small towns respond to&#13;
poverty reduction objectives. The first concern should therefore be to ensure that small towns have efficient and&#13;
financially viable water systems. Within this framework expansion and demand responsiveness will foster broader&#13;
access to services for low-income households.&#13;
*   Access to services forpoor households can be supported by:&#13;
- Providing an element of grant for the initial investment so that tariffs remain affordable which implies&#13;
investing in basic facilities before the town population reaches the critical size required for full cost&#13;
recovery on capital expenditure;&#13;
- Facilitating access by reducing connection charges; and, last but not least;&#13;
- Ensuring that the governance arrangements give the poor a voice as stakeholders and customers.&#13;
While communities and private operators seem able to mobilize the resource needed for expanding the&#13;
distribution network, this is not the case for the lumpy capital injection needed to build or rehabilitate the basic&#13;
facilities. Ethiopia's study of cost effective design and Senegal model for multi-village schemes illustrate the&#13;
complex relationships between production capacity, tariff level and financing options.&#13;
This suggests that development of optimal financing strategies is a critical element for the preparation of&#13;
sector programs directed at small towns. The challenge is threefold, to maximize the mobilization of local&#13;
resource and loans while at the same time building a system of sufficient capacity to realize the economies of scale&#13;
and offered by ST and keep tariffs at affordable levels. This is an issue that is critical for the design of programs that&#13;
seek to maximize the poverty impact of public funds (budget and external aid) allocated to the water sector, and&#13;
on which further learning is clearly called for.&#13;

SESSION 3 Professional Support and Aggregation                                     Day 2 PM&#13;
Understanding how STs can best access professional support and how related capacities can be developed is&#13;
thereforecritical forthe publicpolicyand program design.&#13;
Small town WSS systems serving population in the range from 2,000 to 100,000, need access to specialist&#13;
services beyond routine technical and financial functions to ensure efficient, sustainable services that can be&#13;
expanded to meet growing. The problem is that towns can't afford the requisite professional support by&#13;
themselvesand so must join togethertosharecosts. Atown thatfailsto securesupportfortechnical and financial&#13;
training, business planning, expansion planning and efficiency strategies will not succeed.&#13;
Direct vs. delegated management&#13;
Understanding ST water systems require clarifying: Who owns the facilities? Who oversees the assets and&#13;
supervises operations (water authority)? And who operates the facilities (water services providers)?&#13;
Often the water authority responsibility for ensuring that services are provided is interpreted as the responsibility&#13;
for providing the services. As a result, town water supplies are almost always managed by a public entities; e.g.&#13;
Municipal Water Department, Water Board, Water UserAssociation, of a National/Regional Utility.&#13;
In all these cases of direct management the oversight body, hires and directly manages its own staff. Routine&#13;
operations and maintenance are handled reasonably well but other more strategic functions like business plans,&#13;
expansion programs, and strategies to improve efficiency are overlooked. In fact, it is inherently difficult under&#13;

can  also  introduce clearly defined     Competitive&#13;
performance targets and incentives that&#13;
are lacking in direct management, and&#13;
offer the opportunity to terminate a contract or switch to a new operator at the end of a contract period.&#13;
Contracts also offer opportunities from local entrepreneurs to make business in the water sector, and replace&#13;
monopolies with competing operators selected on the basis of price and performance.&#13;
There are two types of contacts full service and specialized services. Full service operators "offer one stop&#13;
shopping" where both routine and specialized services are provided by the operator. In the specialized service&#13;
model routine operations and specialized services are offered separately. An example of the specialized services&#13;
model is franchising, where the franchisor offers specialized services to a local operator, the franchisee for a share&#13;
of the revenue.&#13;
Aggregation&#13;
Aggregation is critical to share cost and build a sufficient demand for specialized services and support. This&#13;
applies also to smaller towns (2,000 to 10,000) for which costs can be reduced by directly employing their own&#13;
staff through performance agreements or by contracting a private operator from within the community.&#13;

Volume 1, Summary of Intemational Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns and Multi-village Schemes&#13;
Aggregation models differ by the extend to which their association is institutionalized. Towns can:&#13;
-  Form a formal association or company that contracts a full service operator&#13;
- Join together for bidding, but sign separate contracts, or&#13;
-  Enter into separate contracts with established operators in a given areas.&#13;
They may also obtain support from NGOs, consulting firms, and contractors. In the USA, the Federal Government&#13;
contracts NGOs to provide technical and financial assistance to towns free of charge.&#13;
In conclusion,&#13;
* Towns need professional support for both routine and specialized water service operations.&#13;
* Larger towns could contract with a full water service operator to provide both routine and specialized&#13;
services, whilst smaller towns would use local operators, public or private, supplemented by specialist service&#13;
providers.&#13;
* Towns benefitfrom competition to counter monopoliesthat build capacityand improveservice; and&#13;
* Towns need to join together in one way or another (aggregate) to create viable units capable of securing the&#13;
necessary professional support.&#13;
The challenge is to support and foster the evolution towards management and aggregation models that offer&#13;
better prospects for services improvements and for continued expansion in response to the demands of growing&#13;
small communities. In this planners and policy makers will be guided by the lessons emerging from local&#13;
experiences as illustrated by cases studies.&#13;
Case studies: Innovations to meet special challenges&#13;
Case studies presented in Addis Ababa highlighted the huge range of small town scenarios worldwide, and some&#13;
of the success stories in adapting management arrangements to local context. Case studies were presented in&#13;
four categories:&#13;
(i)  Direct management by local government or communities;&#13;
(ii)  Delegated management with design and/or build contracts (e.g. design-build-lease);&#13;
(iii) Delegated management without design and/or build contracts; and&#13;
(iv) Regional and national utilities.&#13;

The key points from the Work Group reports are summarized in Annex 2.&#13;
Small towns meet their special challenge, i.e. to access the professional support they need at a cost they can&#13;
afford, through some form of cost sharing or aggregation. The two principle strategies are: (i) individual (smaller)&#13;
towns with local operators share the costs of supplemental professional support (e.g. Mauritania, Tanzania)'; and&#13;
(ii) (larger) towns aggregate to establish a customer/revenue base that supports a more experienced operator&#13;
(e.g. Cote d'lvoire, Malawi, France, Netherlands, Spain). In some cases there may be a mix of these two strategies&#13;
(e.g. USA, where rural towns may aggregate into a Public Service District, but professional support is still provided&#13;
through NGOs and "circuit riders").&#13;

Other options illustrated by the case studies presented in Addis Ababa included: multi-village schemes (e.g.&#13;
Senegal, Tanzania); clustering towns for bidding purposes (e.g. Uganda, Philippines2); combining capital works&#13;
contracts with management, operation and maintenance contracts (e.g. Philippines, Paraguay, Colombia3,&#13;
Niger); towns forming an umbrella association which provides support (e.g. Tanzania); and national utilities using&#13;
cross-subsidies (e.g Cote d'lvoire), or contracting out distribution to local enterprises (e.g. Morocco).&#13;
Panel Discussion&#13;
The responses from panel members to questions and comments from the participants in the plenary discussion&#13;
thatconcluded Session 4 are briefly summarize hereafter.&#13;
1. The independence of auditors hired in by the Management Boards of Water Service utilities rest on their&#13;
professional code of ethics and their global reputation.&#13;
2. The key difference between management by councils and management by hired operators rest in the fact that&#13;
day-to-day in the latter case operations and ownership/oversight of the service are separated avoiding the&#13;
possibility of conflicts of interest.&#13;
3. Points to watch in larger utilities selling their services to operators of smaller systems: (ii) real incentives; (ii) lack&#13;
of balance in relationship leading to difficult working relationships.  Indonesia and Morocco provide&#13;
examples of satisfactory experience.&#13;
4. Although cases of more than one operator serving a given area are rare, the potential benefits are illustrated&#13;
by Paraguay's Aguateros where open entry and competition in the market is considered to have led to&#13;
expansion of service to areasthat otherwise would remain unserved by a monopoly provider.&#13;
5. There is no strong case for limiting the size and number of companies bidding for operating contracts. The&#13;
best is to structure the contract so as to attract maximum competition and to establish qualification criteria.&#13;
The processwastherefore self-regulating in this respect.&#13;
6. Political interference should be considered as an "occupational hazard" of water service provision and almost&#13;
impossible to avoid. One way is not to have WUAs board members with a particular political influence.&#13;
7. Mali has shown that the "professionalisation" of WUAs can be economically viable in situation where the&#13;
costs are shared at a national level. There should be no excuse for WUAs to employ "amateurs", i.e. persons&#13;
required to work beyond their capabilities. It was always going to be cost-effective to employ specialists&#13;
capable of meeting the skill requirements of any activities.&#13;
8. Strategic communication of objectives through professionally competent communicators is critical in&#13;
fostering the considerable behavioral changes needed from decision-makers and users. Customer trust is vital&#13;
in all situation more particularly so when regulation is weak.&#13;

SESSION 4 Sanitation                                                Day 3 AM June 13, 2002&#13;
While the numerous cases of development of ST water supply systems provide consistent lessons, no such&#13;
foundation is available for small town sanitation. The objective of the full session dedicated to sanitation was&#13;
therefore to identify issues and draw on the experience of the participants to come up with basic principles to&#13;
guide further research and pilot efforts on institutional arrangements, financing and technologies.&#13;
The issue facing sanitation and public hygiene in small towns reflect the general state of sanitation in urban&#13;
contexts:&#13;
- Poor awareness about hygiene and lack of demand&#13;
-  Lackofpoliciesand leadership&#13;
- Unclear allocation of responsibilities. Lack of coordination and weak capacity&#13;
-  Lowpriorityand lackoffinancing mechanism&#13;
The starting point is forcommunities and households tosee the needfora c/ean andhealthyenvironment.&#13;
The drive to improve sanitation in small towns should address the range of environmental issues: used water and&#13;
excreta disposal, solid waste management and drainage, and should rest on a clear understanding of the&#13;
respective role and responsibilities of households and the community.&#13;
It is when future cities are still small towns that incipient urban communities have the best opportunities to&#13;
establish shared expectations and land-use planning that will set them on the right environmental path. In order&#13;
to seize these opportunities small towns need:&#13;
- A Vision of a clean and healthy environment&#13;
- A Policy reflecting the attitudes needed to carry the vision, e.g. ART (Avoid, Reuse, and Treat waste) and,&#13;
the will to implement it through advocacy, clear institutional arrangements, standards, funding&#13;
mechanisms and enforcement capacity&#13;
- A Priority to mobilize communities and households to take initiatives that can make sanitation a reality&#13;
and evolve their own local strategy to pursue their vision of a clean and healthy city.&#13;

Ideas drew more twenty-five entries covering a wide range of proposals ranging from innovations in technologies&#13;
(new flush systems for pit latrine) to "big picture ideas" (toilet before arms). The brainstorming mini-sessions&#13;
organized around each of the "winning" proposals fully engaged the participants and in some casestransformed&#13;
simple concepts into outlines of action plans. The winning ideas are briefly outlined in Annex 5 and are marked&#13;
below with an asterisk.&#13;
The innovations at the core of the various proposals center on a wide range of emphasis: advocacy and citizens&#13;
initiative - financing and resource mobilization - technologies - institutions and policies - knowledge&#13;
management. Most of the "winning" proposalsfelt in thetwo first categories.&#13;
*   Proposals centered on financing and resource mobilization got the most votes. Their common objective of&#13;
was to provide enlarged and secure flows of funds to support WSS services with a strong emphasis on&#13;
sanitation. Many proposals were appeals to external agencies and governments. Many were based on "win-&#13;
win" in peace or health:&#13;
- Cigarette tax for WSS services*&#13;
- Collect EURO 0.01 per cubic meter of water billed to European customers to finance WSS in developing&#13;
countries*&#13;
- Prescribe minimum spending limits on the annual budgets of governments to ensure that investment&#13;
takes place in thewater sector*&#13;
- Water tariff to include a surcharge to finance hygiene promotion and demand for on-site sanitation (a la&#13;
Burkina)*&#13;
- Invest in the toilets before investing in defense*&#13;
- Donor agencies/governments to give a one-time grant to establish a revolving fund for WSS projects in&#13;
small towns in partnership with NGO's and PS.&#13;
*   As a group advocacy, promotion and "citizen initiative" proposals came in second; they included:&#13;
- Marketing and promotion of sanitation and hygiene through messages on soap bars*&#13;
- A big push for hygiene education in schools*&#13;
- Build consensus among civil societyfor PSP in WSS services*&#13;
- Safe drainage discard polyethylene bags so that they do not end up clogging drainage excreta disposal&#13;
facility*&#13;
- A global campaign to eliminate "flying toilets" in slums by providing affordable sanitation.&#13;
*   Knowledge management&#13;
- WATSAN websites for practitioners directed at public agencies/donors, NGO but also at small town&#13;
boards and operators*&#13;
*   Proposals centered on technology dealt mostly with low cost sanitation, and include&#13;
- Treatmentofwastewaterthroughbio-filters,passingeffluentthroughaskipsoakpit&#13;
- Conserve water using pit latrines and new flush systems. Use dry waste (sludge) for biogas production&#13;
and liquid effluentforagriculture purpose&#13;
- Condominial seweragetechnologyfor low-income households.&#13;
*   Several proposals focused on institutional approach were based on the adaptation of cases studies and&#13;
ingredient for success:&#13;
- Dissemination of professional support model pioneered in by the Juntas of Paraguay (water users&#13;
associations) providing support to 20-50 small town WSS operators&#13;
- Regional competence centers to foster higher performance from boards working in long-term&#13;
partnership private operators.&#13;
- Use of IT-based tools to increase the productivity of small water and sanitation systems (billing, O&amp;M)&#13;

the operations and financial results of a specific             Box 13: Without a viable business plan&#13;

SESSION 6 Contracting Options                                       Day 4 AM June 15,2002&#13;
The Conference session on contracting reviewed options to move from the so-called "default options" direct&#13;
community management and informal design-build-operate to delegation through contracts considering in&#13;
particular options involving increasing degrees of private sector involvement in management and in financing&#13;
(see Box 17). The working groups on these themes were introduced by presentations on service/management&#13;
contracts, lease and concession contracts, franchising and Public Limited Companies.&#13;
The objective of the session was to map the progression of ST WSS systems towards contracting options and&#13;
management models under which "professional support" is provided with increasing levels of private sector&#13;
financing, starting from "default options", i.e. direct public management or informal delegation (e.g. local Build-&#13;
Own-Operate) corresponding to a weak legal/regulatoryframework,&#13;
As small town water systems follow the trend toward delegated management, it will be essential for policy&#13;
makers, planners as well as operators to develop their understanding of: (i) how best to structure the contractual&#13;

The unfolding worldwide movement toward PPP in the&#13;

0.    l        =      * service/mngt contract  The first point is that PPP needs commitment from all&#13;
stakeholders  particularly in the establishment of&#13;
appropriate levels of regulation early in the process and&#13;
Pubic  PManagement                  the commitment to apply these during implementation.&#13;
Obtaining this commitment requires good&#13;
communication of the changes that will be necessary to&#13;
implement PPP. The choice of contract has to take into account a realistic assessment of the local context and the&#13;
prerequisites for success corresponding to each option (Box 18).&#13;

Concession     High     High     High     High      opportunity for about 20% in operational&#13;
expenditure.&#13;
Service contracts are the simplest for of PPP and are used to undertake specific elements of water service&#13;
operations e.g. billing and collection, pump maintenance, etc. Management contracts go one step further as&#13;
they transfer management responsibility to an operator. They produce the best results when they include&#13;
incentives and penalties for pre-determined performance targets. They are commonly considered a first-step&#13;
towards more complex PPP in effect, raising utility performance to a point that it will be attractive to the private&#13;
sector for lease/affermage or concessions.&#13;
The concession model is recognized as the best option for improving services and reducing cost, however its&#13;
feasibility in many developing countries is limited, as it requires that the investment program be funded from a&#13;
combination of internal cash generation, commercial debt and private equity. Most PPP, especially in Africa, are&#13;
based on the lease/affermage model in which the contracting authority (usually the government through the&#13;
asset-holding company) remains responsible for investments. Under the "enhanced leaselaffermage"which&#13;
has emerged as the model of choice in Africa, the operator is granted a considerable degree of autonomy in the&#13;
planning and execution of capital expenditure especially as they are under the Public Water Plc model, which&#13;
has evolved in the Netherlands, the responsibility for water services is entrusted to companies established by a&#13;
group of municipalities under the general corporate laws of the country. These provide ready-made legal&#13;
framework with requirements concerning financial reporting, auditing and disclosure. Public Water Plc's have&#13;
the freedom to use private sector contractors and are in the position to access private capital. The trend toward&#13;
regrouping and outsourcing is an attempt to overcome the limitations arising from the fragmentation and the&#13;
low level competition.&#13;
The franchising approach as applied to WSS services, would have an experienced operator, the Franchisor,&#13;
render services and transfer business know-how to a smaller water company, the Franchisee. The Franchisor&#13;
would be responsible for monitoring quality of performance of its Franchisees. Although only some of the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Volume 1, Summary of International Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns and Multi-village Schemes&#13;
elements of the franchising approach have been implemented, e.g. Morocco, the Conference considered that it&#13;
had considerable potential for WSS services for small towns. In fact it would exhibit all the ingredient for success&#13;
but one (Box 19).&#13;

Franchising&#13;
* This innovative approach was welcomed and it was considered that it was worthy of further study. While the&#13;
model implies that the Franchisor is private, the model could be developed with a public Fanchisor relying on&#13;
capacityalready in place in the public sector.&#13;
Regulation&#13;
* Although some aspects of regulation should be undertaken at a national level national standards for water&#13;
quality, framework for contracting the private sector, tariff setting process etc.- the majority of regulatory&#13;
activities should be left to regional and local bodies.&#13;
* Water authorities contracting the private operators should not underestimate the resources and capabilities&#13;
needed to monitor, supervise and control the contracts. Communities may associate to hire the necessary&#13;
professional support.&#13;
Tariff setting&#13;
* As a rule, tariff setting should remain under the public sector but should take into account business planning&#13;
forwhich it is vital to involve the private sector.&#13;
Financing&#13;
* The best option to attract private financing for small towns WSS would be to link it with public financing,&#13;
leveraging the latter to mobilize the former.&#13;
* The financing for sanitation needs to clarify the respective role of households and of the public sector&#13;
especially for on-site sanitation and wastewater disposal. The promotion of on-site sanitation by private actors&#13;
would need some form of public support.&#13;
Garbage collection and disposal&#13;
* Although private sector collection is likely to be more efficient, small towns may not offer a sufficient market to&#13;
interest private operators and may have to share some of the costs. This would certainly be the case for&#13;
disposal that, if carried out correctly, is expensive.&#13;
* The option of cross-subsidizing solid waste management with a surcharge on water tariff was considered&#13;
without reaching consensus.&#13;

Community systems undergoing expansion&#13;
Expansion of WSS services in ST would require the three parties involved: the Community, government&#13;
agencies (and donors), and the PS, to cohtribute to what they are best ai.&#13;
- The private sector would contribute professional support and financial resources.&#13;
- The public sector would undertake regulation, provide the legal framework for involving the private sector&#13;
and, in some cases, providefinanceand professional support.&#13;
The community would mobilize the necessary resources and organization to provide oversight. In any case the&#13;
community itself should be the driving force and to retain ownership of the critical decisions and of the process.&#13;
This implies that good information on issues and alternatives, which in turn would require access to external&#13;
assistance possibly from NGOs.&#13;
SESSION 7 The Change Process                                                      Day4 PM&#13;
The objective of the session was to map the progression of ST WSS systems towards contracting options and&#13;
management models under which "professional support" is provided with increasing levels of private sector&#13;
financing. The initial overview of these "change process" introduced four cases (Ghana, Indonesia, Vietnam and&#13;
Uganda) of countries engaged in the transition from "default options", i.e. direct public management, direct&#13;
community management or informal delegation (e.g. local Build-Own-Operate) to more formal contracting and&#13;
aggregation (Box 20).&#13;
Box 20: Criteria for Aggregation include  The change process is driven by the fact that, as small towns&#13;
grow and as their WSS system expand and become more&#13;
* 'Largeenough'populationbase          complex "default options" are not good enough. The lessons&#13;
* 'Manageable'overalidistance          from the cases is that community management has notable&#13;
* Withinawatershedboundary             strengths, but is not adequate to address long term&#13;
* Voluntaryorprescribed                sustainability The cases suggest that beyond 5,000 inhabitants,&#13;
__________________________________ -community management needs to evolve toward more&#13;
institutionalized models involving water boards with a legal basis and the capacity to enter into formal contracts.&#13;
Direct management bya public agency, centrally or through local branches, has not worked for rural communities&#13;
and is equally unable to respond to the challenges of small towns as shown by the Vietnam and Indonesia cases.&#13;
The first step is to improve the institutional and regulatory framework to provide a legal basis for:&#13;
(i) TheestablishmentofautonomouslocalentitiesresponsibleforWSSservices;&#13;
(ii) For their contractual relationships with operators and services providers; and,&#13;
(iii) For partnerships and regrouping among local water services authorities.&#13;
The next step w6uld be to facilitate and support local initiatives to outsource or delegate through contracts and to&#13;
aggregate with other towns. The broad options for aggregation include: regional or multi-town utilities, multi-&#13;
purpose associations of small towns and franchising. Box&#13;

Volume 1, Summary of Intemational Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns and Multi-village Schemes&#13;
- Management contracts with relatively short duration can be an attractive learning step for allowing them&#13;
to build confidence in their capacity to supervise the operator.&#13;
- Equally important to provide comfort and stability to the private operator by giving a legal basis to the&#13;
authority of the local water boards (by-laws, statutes) and building their capacity.&#13;
- The emergence development of specialized WSS services operators needs to be helped along. WSS&#13;
professionals and local contractors are prime candidates to enter the field.&#13;
Programs to support the change process for should be guided by the following principles:&#13;
- To nurtureand supportthe initiatives of local actorsthrough flexible responseand support mechanisms;&#13;
- To emphasize capacity building based on tools and practices reflecting local experience;&#13;
- To foster country level learning, knowledge sharing and networking among scattered actors involved in ST&#13;
WSS services.&#13;
Summing up:   Institutional arrangements are clearly evolving.&#13;
There is a need to learn pilot new approaches&#13;
There is a need to do research (recognizing that we do not know all the answers)&#13;
SESSION 8 Closing and Follow-up                                                   Day4 PM&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
Governments and their development partners should recognize that small towns and multi-village schemes&#13;
represent a special challenge and that they need specific policies and programs.&#13;
The ingredients for success provide a framework to assess the performance of town water supply systems and to&#13;
identify their need for professional support needs and to map options to foster efficiency and to support&#13;
continued expansion.&#13;
Public-private-partnerships introduce many advantages, not least in building local business opportunities and&#13;
better career prospects. The challenge is to balance aggregation and delegation strategies with local&#13;
accountability.&#13;
The proper focus of programs for the development of WSS services for small towns would be to guide and&#13;
support local initiatives. The approach will involve continuous learning and piloting. The objective is to set the&#13;
stage for sector programs that are the necessary framework to deal institutional issues and financing&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
Knowledge development and networking&#13;
Developing and improving ST WSS service should approached as a learning process at all levels: communities,&#13;
country and global/regional, relying on case studies, models, good practices, tools and guidelines.&#13;
The Conference stressed the need for further knowledge development and networking on issues related to WSS&#13;
services for STwith special attention to sanitation and to services for low-income groups and communities.&#13;
Priorities forfurtherlearning&#13;
- To develop further case material and models on ST management, aggregation options, contracting,&#13;
regulation and PPPfor ST as well as financing mechanisms.&#13;
- To develop guidance material on: need assessments and capacity building options for professional&#13;
support, financing strategies and marketing, capacity building and promotion of small scale entrepreneur&#13;
in WSS services.&#13;
- To further develop, adapt and disseminate guidelines and practical tools, in particular financial models for&#13;
business planning, cost effective design, benchmarking/monitoring, tariff systems, procurement process&#13;
and model contracts, criteria for clustering and aggregation.&#13;

EVALUATION and FEEDBACK&#13;
Annex 8 provides an overview of the analysis of the 70 responses to the evaluation questionnaires together with a&#13;
synthesis of comments and suggestions from participants. The written comments provided by participants at the&#13;
end of the closing session are summarized in Annex 9.&#13;
Key points:&#13;
The first point emerging form the comments as well as the rating is that conference was found very interesting,&#13;
useful and well organized; 62 positive comments. The outstanding suggestions for improvements concern (i) the&#13;
lagging quality of the translation and the lack of translated documents; and, (ii) more advance information,&#13;
possibly on the web.&#13;
The participants found the choice of topics and the presentations of high quality and useful (22 positive&#13;
comments). The long list of suggestions (22) shows the need for further information and exchanges in particular&#13;
on: sanitation, management models, and practical guidance material.&#13;
The dominant points from the comments on program design and delivery is that many participants felt the time&#13;
allowed for exchanges and O&amp;A insufficient (39). This is echoed in numerous comments concerning the need for&#13;
more group workand exchanges.&#13;
One outstanding comment is the call for more balanced proportion of Francophone presenters (8). To be linked&#13;
with the comments mentioned above on translation and lack of French versions of documents.&#13;
In a nutshell, the feedback and the comments from the participants suggest that the conference was found of&#13;
real interest and that the presentations and the documents of high quality. Key points for future events:&#13;
*   Program less demanding and allowing moretimefor exchanges.&#13;
*   More attention to elements allowing full involvement of Francophone participants: documents, quality of&#13;
translation.&#13;
*   Lot of interest in further research and practical guidance especially on sanitation and management models&#13;

ANNEX 4: Priority of Further Learning&#13;
The reports from the working groups, the networking activity and the participants comments consistently&#13;
support further networking and knowledge sharing and development on issues related to WSS services for ST. The&#13;
feedbackfromparticipantsputsparticularemphasisonsanitation.Thepresentoverviewisstructuredasfollows:&#13;
- Documenting and building knowledge&#13;
- Networking, disseminating and sharing knowledge.&#13;
Unless indicated otherwise the activities are meant to cover both water and sanitation services.&#13;
Activities specifically directed at sanitation are underlined.&#13;
A) Documenting and building knowledge on ST WSS services&#13;
The Conference has shown the large number and the diversity of local initiatives for ST WSS services as well as the&#13;
need to build on existing systems. Developing and improving ST WSS service should approached as a learning&#13;
process at all levels: communities, country and global/regional. The process is based on: (i) case studies; (ii) models&#13;
and good practices; and, (iii) tools and guidelines.&#13;
Case studies&#13;
Participants showed strong interest in case studies to document practical experiences and innovations and drew&#13;
attention to the need to develop quality guidelines for case studies.&#13;
They singled out the following themes:&#13;
- Poor communities,&#13;
- Gravity schemes,&#13;
- Water user associations using professional management&#13;
- Rural entrepreneurship&#13;
- Franchising&#13;
-  Incentives structure for commu nity management models&#13;
- Public private partnerships in small towns&#13;
- Regulation in rural systems and small towns, etc.&#13;
- Sustained sanitation promotion without government support&#13;
Models andpractices4&#13;
Participants emphasized the usefulness of new and existing models to guide project design and implementation&#13;
in particular on the following aspects:&#13;
* Models:&#13;
-  Management model in particularfor large multi-town projects&#13;
- Community mobilization&#13;
- Outsourcing and PPP (contracting, incentives, legal and financial aspects)&#13;
- Financial management&#13;
- Financing mechanisms&#13;
* Practices&#13;
- Water resource management (catchments protection)&#13;
- Service to low income households and poor communities (subsidy schemes)&#13;
- Financing of household connections, especially for sanitation&#13;
- Financing strategies and marketing&#13;
- Capacity building and promotion of small scale entrepreneur in WSS services&#13;
- Tariff systems for multi-village and rural schemes (process and structure)&#13;
- Regulation systems and procedures, how to set rules of the game&#13;
- Partnerships between utilities and small scale independent providers in ST&#13;
- Financing and cost recoveryfor sanitation including the financing of household facilities&#13;
-  Sanitation technologies for ST (including eco-san. septage removal)&#13;
'Models andpractices generalize the findings of cases studies dealng with a given themes andprovide a synthetic overview ofhow to approach a given objective in a vanety of&#13;
contexts. Model andpractices cover technicalaspects but they also focus on institutional relationships andprocesses The term Model is refers to solutions that concem WSS&#13;
systems as whole, while the term Practices concern a specific objective e g services to the poor regulation etc&#13;

Guidelines and Tools&#13;
Participants stressed the importance of tools as necessary links between policies and local implementation. They&#13;
called for broader dissemination and customization of the tools reviewed by the Conference and for the&#13;
development of additional tools and guidelines:&#13;
* Further development and adaptation&#13;
- Cost effective design&#13;
- Business planning&#13;
- Willingness to pay survey&#13;
- Billing systems&#13;
*   Development&#13;
- Tariff setting&#13;
- Performance assessment methodology and data base for benchmarking&#13;
- Procurement processand model contract documents for PPP options adapted forST&#13;
- By-laws and statutesfor STwater boards&#13;
- Criteria for clustering and aggregation&#13;
- Implementation of franchising&#13;
- Guidelines for regulation&#13;
- Municipal regulation and by-laws forwater and sanitation services in ST&#13;
- Guidelines for choice of technologyforsanitation&#13;
B) Networking, disseminating and sharing knowledge&#13;

ANNEX 5: Summary of Follow-up Project&#13;
Town Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative&#13;
A project proposed to the Bank Netherlands Water Partnership (BNPW)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
There is growing consensus on suitable models for service delivery to large urban centers and to rural&#13;
communities. Towns fall between these two models, and no consensus has been reached on how best to provide&#13;
service to customers in these areas. Interest in town water supply and sanitation has grown rapidly over the past&#13;
several years, with organizations such as IRC and WEDC, in addition to the World Bank and the Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program, establishing their own small towns programs.&#13;
There is a range of options to enhance or create capacity in service provision. At the lower end of the spectrum&#13;
there may be a need for some mechanism of professional support to small and medium sized operators, in order&#13;
to ensure good quality of service. These professional support arrangements may be a condition of a basic contract&#13;
(e.g. an enhanced management or lease contract), and will likely include a program of SME development. On the&#13;
demand side, towns must be aggregated to take advantage of the economies of scale that make such services&#13;
affordable to the town and financially viable to the operator. Towards the higher end of the spectrum,&#13;
aggregation may also attract larger, more experienced operators.&#13;

A.   Overview of Town WSS - a consolidation of existing material, in particular the key ingredients for success&#13;
in town WSS, the need for professional support, the professional support options, and the fundamental&#13;
need for aggregation to secure professional support.&#13;
B.  Issues in aggregating and contracting - providing a comprehensive evaluation of the practical issues&#13;
and ways of getting professional support.&#13;
C.  Strategy for SME development (making it all happen) - an assessment of barriers/options for getting&#13;
SMEs into the market, and methodology for market testing management model options.&#13;

PARTICIPANTS COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS:&#13;
Question 2: yourfeedback: most/least, useful, do differently, etc.&#13;
Question 3: additional comments.&#13;
The numerous responses to the two questions have been regrouped in three broad categories and four themes.&#13;
The numbers of comments aswell the points at which they are directed are summarized on theTable below.&#13;
Summary of Comments&#13;
The first point emerging form the comments as well as the rating is that conference was found very interesting,&#13;
usefulandwellorganized; 62positivecomments.Theoutstandingsuggestionsforimprovementsconcern(i)&#13;
the lagging quality of the translation and the lack of translated documents; and, (ii) more advanced information,&#13;
possibly on the web.&#13;
The participants found the choice of topics and the presentations of high quality and useful (22 positive&#13;
comments). The long list of suggestions (22) for more information can be interpreted as a sign that the&#13;
Conference created interest and demand for further information and exchanges. Three themes stand out:&#13;
sanitation (8), management models including community-based (4) and practical follow-up and evaluation (3).&#13;
The dominant points from the comments on program design delivery is that many participants felt the time&#13;
allowed for exchanges and Q&amp;A insufficient (39). This is somewhat echoed in the series of comments on&#13;
the working groups: "dominated by presenters and facilitators" (4), "group discussion excellent"(2), "too&#13;
rushed" (1), "should be better prepared" (1), "smaller group" (1); and "more group work" (1). It is clear also that&#13;
the number of participants, 200 plus, limited the possibilities for small working groups in spite of the&#13;
acknowledged "excellent facilitation".&#13;
While every activities got some positive comments, a number of participants commented that the "days were&#13;
too long and exhausting" (5). One may draw the conclusion that although the program was found&#13;
interesting it was a bit demanding.&#13;
One outstanding comment is the call for more balanced proportion of Francophone presenters (8). To be linked&#13;
with the comments mentioned above on translation and lack of French versions of documents.&#13;
The networking activity was appreciated (5 positive comments) and the participants expressed support for the&#13;
creation of professional network/forum of WSS professionals (2); a group of participants from West Africa&#13;
decided "here and now" to launch such a network. Their initial declaration has been included in the proceedings.&#13;
The comments on participants mix are few and are directed in particular at gender imbalance (2). Several&#13;
comments suggest that such conferences be organizedperiodicallybyregion (6).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Volume 1, Summary of International Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns and Multi-village Schemes&#13;
In a nutshell, the feedback and the comments from the participants suggest that the conference was found of real&#13;
interest and that the presentations and the documents of high quality. Key points for future events:&#13;
- Program less demanding and allowing moretime for exchanges.&#13;
-   More attention to elements allowing full involvement of Francophone participants: documents, quality of&#13;
translation.&#13;
-   Lot of interest in further research and practical guidance especiallyon sanitation and management models.&#13;
OVERVIEW OF PARTICIPANTS COMMENTS&#13;
Numbers indicate number of times that a given idea/comment came up. Recognizing that what participants&#13;
choose to write about is just as important as what they wrote, comments pertaining to similar themes/opinions&#13;
were regrouped to allow an overview and draw conclusions.&#13;

            In 1999, the Bank's Rural Water
            Supply and Sanitation (WSS) Thematic Group, in collaboration
            with the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), launched a
            global small towns initiative to study, and document
            innovative management models that provide good quality,
            affordable services that are sustainable, and can be
            expanded to meet demand. This effort led to simultaneous
            E-Conferences, sharing a wealth of information about local
            initiatives, aimed at improving water services in small
            towns. Herewith are the proceedings of the International
            Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation for Small Towns
            and Multi-village Schemes - Conference Summary V. 1 - where
            practitioners reviewed case studies, and shared experiences.
            The proceedings are structured as follows: 1) the Conference
            statement attempts to capture the broad, shared
            understanding developed through the presentations/exchanges;
            2) Volume 1 - Conference Summary - expands on the summary,
            and includes selected annexes on special sessions, and
            provides participant feedback; 3) Volume 2 - Presentations -
            includes the complete set of presentations, and will be made
            available electronically; and 4) Volume 3 - Posters - will
            be a compendium of posters, likewise to V. 2, accessible electronically.
