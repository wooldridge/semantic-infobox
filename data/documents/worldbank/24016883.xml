            Primary care for the poor : the potential
            of micro-health markets to improve care
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Much of the primary curative care
            provided to the poor by the private sector occurs not at
            large hospitals but at small, single-person clinics. While
            such micro-health providers increase access, questions
            persist about quality. Some have argued that the
            micro-health sector needs to be better regulated. This note
            cites recent studies in arguing that the micro-health sector
            needs to be better understood. A more evidence based
            approach may enable the World Bank Group to better target
            investments and interventions and help these providers
            fulfill an important role serving the poor. The following
            recommendations are made at the conclusion of this paper:
            (1) Effort, rather than hardware or training, may count the
            most. (2) Scaling up interventions to improve quality
            requires understanding and addressing market failures. (3)
            Changing the way impacts are measured will lead to smarter investments.
