ï»¿ANNEX I&#13;
Part II Europe 2020 Trust Fund Description&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the&#13;
Trust Fund between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
1. Objectives&#13;
The objectives of the Trust Fund are:&#13;
The European Commission and the Bank share a common objective of building competitive and&#13;
sustainable economies and reducing poverty and social exclusion - goals of the Europe 2020 Agenda&#13;
which is built on three pillars of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The European Commission&#13;
and the Bank concur that direct interaction is beneficial to both institutions and through them to the&#13;
beneficiary countries. This applies particularly to the provision of analytical, advisory and knowledge&#13;
services and technical assistance.&#13;
The European Commission has expressed an interest in ensuring that the Bank continues to provide&#13;
technical assistance in the framework of the Trust Fund in furtherance of the common objective set&#13;
forth above.&#13;
2. Activities&#13;
The objectives and description of the activities are:&#13;
2.1 The European Commission, particularly the Structural Reform Support Services (SRSS), has&#13;
expressed an interest in ensuring that the Bank provides technical assistance with the specific objective&#13;
of assisting and supporting the Government of Greece undertake a Social Welfare Review (SWR) to&#13;
increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the social protection system in Greece. The ultimate&#13;
objective of the Government of Greece being to undertake reforms that create a more comprehensive&#13;
welfare system, with a guaranteed minimum income (GMI) scheme at its centre to improve social&#13;
cohesion in Greece.&#13;
The SWR would contribute to the ongoing reform of the social assistance system in Greece to assist&#13;
the Greek Government make the system more streamlined, and more effective in alleviating poverty.&#13;
In this context, the Greek Government has agreed in the third Memorandum of Understanding with the&#13;
European Commission that the Review will be targeted to generate savings of 1/2 percent of GDP&#13;
annually from cash and in-kind benefits, tax benefits, the social security benefits and other welfare&#13;
benefits across the general government which will serve as the basis for the redesign of a targeted&#13;
welfare system, including the fiscally-neutral gradual national roll-out of the GMI. The SWR will&#13;
build on the recent study developed by the Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Social Solidarity of&#13;
Greece that lists the various non-contributory cash and in-kind transfer programs that exist in Greece;&#13;
and the review of social welfare programmes by the OECD'. The Social Welfare Review will also&#13;
provide initial implementation support to the Roll-Out of the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI)&#13;
Program.&#13;
The SWR will examine in depth the effectiveness of the existing system of social assistance in&#13;
alleviatmig poverty; identity segments of the population Ma ire TIsuficifenrtyovered by it, delrtify&#13;
areas where resources may be more effectively used, e.g. because of possible duplications and&#13;
1OECD (2013), Greece: Reform of Social Welfare Programmes, OECD Public Governance Reviews, OECD Publishing&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿overlaps; and finally suggest appropriate remedies. In addition, the SWR will set up a detailed&#13;
template, and serve as a prototype, of the information needed by the Government to improve the&#13;
effectiveness of the social assistance system. It will support developing the capacity in the public&#13;
administration in Greece so that such social welfare reviews can be conducted at regular time intervals&#13;
in the future.&#13;
As part of the study, a comprehensive review will be undertaken of cash and in-kind social welfare&#13;
(i.e. non-contributory) benefits and benefits provided through the tax system. The review will exclude&#13;
retirement pensions. Specifically, the analysis in the SWR will focus on all non-contributory benefits&#13;
that are financed from general government budget. Since some cash contributory benefits receive large&#13;
transfers from the state budget in Greece, these will also be included in the study, though they are not&#13;
the main focus. Specifically, the distributional impacts of unemployment insurance benefits; and of&#13;
contributory disability pensions will be studied. The policy recommendations will retain a special&#13;
focus on the non-contributory benefits as the prospective rationalization of benefits will focus mainly&#13;
on such programs.&#13;
The rationale for this focus is as follows:&#13;
a) It would be appropriate for the social welfare system in Greece to increase coverage of the&#13;
poorest people in Greece. It is also desirable to reduce any potential inefficiencies as fiscal&#13;
savings achieved thereby can be directed towards the roll out of the poverty targeted&#13;
guaranteed minimum income program. Contributory programs receive large transfers from the&#13;
state budget in Greece. Therefore, studying inefficiencies in contributory programs could&#13;
provide much needed fiscal room for expanding safety nets coverage to the poorest.&#13;
b) The design of unemployment benefits (both contributory and non-contributory) is very&#13;
important. Contributory unemployment benefits serve as the first layer of the safety net for&#13;
individuals who lose their jobs, thus mitigating adverse effects for their families. The next&#13;
layer of protection is made up of unemployment assistance benefits; with the last resort social&#13;
assistance program playing the role of the last layer in the safety net. For this reason, the&#13;
Social Welfare Review will look into both contributory and non-contributory unemployment&#13;
benefits.&#13;
c) Disability benefits (both contributory and non-contributory) are fairly complex in Greece.&#13;
There are at least 35 categories of disability benefits, and most insurance funds provide both&#13;
contributory and non-contributory disability benefits. There are 10 different social assistance&#13;
schemes for blind persons; and 4 different schemes for the deaf and mute (OECD 2013a). The&#13;
SWR will study both contributory and non-contributory disability benefits, but from the point&#13;
of view of their distributional impacts. Benchmarking and cross-country comparisons of the&#13;
level of benefits across other EU countries, mainly using ESSPROS data (where it is&#13;
available), will be undertaken. The study will also assess the number of beneficiaries of&#13;
various schemes and evaluate whether some schemes with similar purposes can be merged so&#13;
as to reduce fragmentation. The reform of the disability benefit system (both contributory and&#13;
non-contributory) is outside the scope of this SWR.&#13;
-----d) Go~ntributoty ,iethinut penionu beritfits are excluded ficini dt scp of this SWR.&#13;
e) Personal tax benefits are included in the scope of the SWR.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿f) At the specific request of the Government of Greece, the scope of the Social Welfare Review&#13;
will include study of in-kind benefits. This review will focus on in-kind benefits financed&#13;
through the general budget. It could be difficult to distinguish (initially at least) what is&#13;
financed from general budget and from social security funds. An initial inventory will seek to&#13;
develop a comprehensive stocktaking of all in-kind benefits, to the extent that data permit, and&#13;
the source of financing. Subsequently the study will focus more deeply on those financed&#13;
through general revenues.&#13;
The World Bank activities under this Agreement will include evaluation of the effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency of the social welfare system as follows:&#13;
Effectiveness of benefits will be evaluated in terms of&#13;
1. Coverage of the poor by cash benefits: The review will examine in detail the coverage of the&#13;
poor by various main existing cash benefit programs, and anti-poverty effectiveness of the&#13;
programs. This can be conducted using survey data. Administrative data, or the criteria of the&#13;
programs, will be used to qualitatively classify the target population for in-kind benefits,&#13;
where data are available.&#13;
2. Adequacy of cash benefits: This review will record the adequacy (or generosity) of the various&#13;
main existing cash benefit programs. Adequacy will be measured in two ways: (a) the&#13;
proportion of disposable incomes of the poor made up by the transfer; and (b) benchmarking&#13;
the transfer amount against objective criteria such as the poverty line, minimum wage, average&#13;
wage, and so on. Where administrative data are available, and imputing is possible,&#13;
benchmarking of the imputed benefit amount will be done for in-kind benefits.&#13;
3. Duplication and / or fragmentation of benefits: Are there many benefits with nearly identical&#13;
objectives? Do gaps exist due to fragmentation of benefits? What are the inter-linkages&#13;
between various benefits?&#13;
4. Labor supply effects and interactions of the tax and benefits systems: An effective social&#13;
protection system ensures that work always pays - and that incentives are provided for&#13;
beneficiaries to accept job offers they may receive.&#13;
Efficiency will be evaluated in terms of&#13;
5. Targeting efficiency: What proportion of the budget spent on a particular program reaches the&#13;
poor? How much leakage exists? What are the inclusion and exclusion errors? Once again,&#13;
this can be more easily done for cash transfers where the value of the transfer is more easily&#13;
recovered in household survey data. Qualitative data, and administrative data and rules will be&#13;
used to identify if in-kind benefits accrue to the poor, where data are available.&#13;
6. Administrative efficiency: Institutional mapping of key players (Ministries that hold the&#13;
budget, delivery channels, payment channels, and information systems) involved in the&#13;
provision of social welfare programs.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Indicative description of outputs&#13;
The following outputs will be delivered by the Bank as part of the SWR2&#13;
Component A: Comprehensive inventory of social welfare and tax benefits along with&#13;
institutional mapping of the social welfare system.&#13;
The Bank will prepare an inventory of all social welfare and tax benefits and an institutional mapping&#13;
of the social welfare system through the delivery of following activities:&#13;
A.1: Inventory of benefits: The Bank will prepare a comprehensive inventory of all cash and in-kind&#13;
social welfare benefits that are financed through general revenue, and of tax benefits. This inventory&#13;
will include amounts spent, number of beneficiaries, intended target population, eligibility criteria,&#13;
where administrative data are made available.&#13;
A.2: Institutional Mapping: The Bank will prepare a report providing an institutional mapping of the&#13;
social welfare system, including examination of (1) delivery channels; (2) payment channels; and (3)&#13;
management information systems.&#13;
Component B: Coverage, adequacy, and anti-poverty effectiveness&#13;
The Bank will carry out an assessment of the coverage of the poor by various main benefits, the&#13;
generosity/adequacy of various main benefits, and the anti-poverty effectiveness of these programs.&#13;
This will also include an assessment of the extent of duplication / fragmentation of benefits. The Bank&#13;
will deliver the following activities:&#13;
B.1: Coverage and adequacy of benefits: The Bank will prepare a report using household survey&#13;
data3 from 2008/2009 and 2012 (or latest available year) to generate estimates of how many poor&#13;
people are covered by various benefit programs. The impact on the poverty headcount and poverty gap&#13;
of such programs will also be generated. The adequacy of benefits will be measured, both as a&#13;
proportion of disposable income, as well as using other objective criteria such as minimum wage and&#13;
so on. Micro simulation methods will be used to estimate the effect of the more recent changes in the&#13;
social protection system (changes implemented in 2013 / 2014 / 2015). This analysis will be done for&#13;
cash benefits listed in the household surveys. Where data are available, administrative data, or&#13;
program criteria will be used to analyse in-kind benefits.&#13;
B.2: Gaps in the social protection coverage: The Bank will prepare a report on the characteristics of&#13;
the poor who receive no support from the social protection system. The main demographic&#13;
characteristics and income components of this population group will be examined using household&#13;
survey data.&#13;
B.3: Duplication/Fragmentation of benefits: The Bank will prepare estimates on the number of&#13;
individuals / families who receive more than one type of benefit; and, to the extent possible, why more&#13;
than one type of benefit is received. Household survey data will be used for this analysis. In addition,&#13;
the use of administrative data sources to attain further insights into duplication will be examined.&#13;
Component C: The Bank will carry out an analysis of benefits provided through the tax system and&#13;
the associated fiscal cost. Report of the consequences of the interactions of the current tax system.&#13;
2 Separate deliverables within each component may potentially be combined if appropriate&#13;
EU-SILC or Household Budget Survey will be chosen as the main data source as appropriate.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿(income tax and payroll taxes) and the key social benefits and potential incentives or (dis)incentives to&#13;
move from unemployment or inactivity to employment will be examined. The Bank will deliver the&#13;
following activities:&#13;
C.1: Study of Tax Benefits: The Bank will prepare a report assessing fiscal costs and distributional&#13;
impacts of the tax benefits as identified in the inventory in output A. 1.&#13;
C.2: Study of Incentives to Work: The Bank will prepare a report computing Marginal Effective Tax&#13;
Rates (METRs) implied by the current tax and benefit system. Proposals relating to income taxation&#13;
and gradual benefit withdrawal to increase incentives to work and the use of back-to-work bonus and&#13;
conditional in-work benefits will be examined.&#13;
Component D: Policy Proposals.&#13;
The Bank will prepare comprehensive evidence based policy proposals for rationalization of the Social&#13;
Welfare System through the delivery of following activities:&#13;
D.1: Proposals for consolidation of benefits: The Bank will prepare a report that develops policy&#13;
proposals for potential consolidation of benefit programs (including cash, in-kind and tax benefits) to&#13;
reduce fragmentation, including simulation of the fiscal and redistributive impacts of proposed&#13;
changes, where data are available.&#13;
D.2: Proposals for achieving administrative efficiency: The Bank will prepare a report developing&#13;
policy proposals for achieving administrative efficiency by potential consolidation of institutional&#13;
structures.&#13;
D.3: Preliminary policy recommendations (first report): The Bank will prepare an initial report&#13;
with initial recommendations for policy reforms by December 2015. This report will contain a&#13;
synthesis of the work done up to that date, including any indicative fiscal savings.&#13;
D.4: Preliminary policy recommendations (second report): The Bank will prepare a second report&#13;
with preliminary recommendations for policy reforms by March 2016. This report will contain a&#13;
synthesis of the work done up to that date, including any indicative fiscal savings.&#13;
D.5: Comprehensive policy recommendations and action plan for reform: The Bank will prepare a&#13;
final report which will pull together the findings across various outputs, and will present overall&#13;
proposals for rationalization; estimates of total fiscal cost savings that may be obtained through&#13;
administrative reforms and through consolidation of benefits; and an action plan for the&#13;
implementation of the SWR recommendations.&#13;
Component E: Initial support to GMI Program Roll-Out.&#13;
Based on the experience of the GMI pilot implementation, the Bank will support the Greek&#13;
Government in the early phase of design of the GMI Program roll-Out. Specifically, activities will&#13;
include:&#13;
E.1: Support the Greek government in developing the GMI Program roll-out action plan.&#13;
E.2: Support the iree~ government in developing an acift fid dHIontut 5tIategy Jvuv~iew fty the&#13;

ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
