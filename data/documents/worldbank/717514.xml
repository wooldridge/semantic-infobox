&amp;#12;&#13;
I. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
A.  Circumstances of the Conflict&#13;
1.  On May 6, 1998, fighting broke out between the armed forces of the Governments&#13;
of Ethiopia and Eritrea along the common border of the two countries. The conflict&#13;
continued for more than two years and was characterized by relatively short bursts of&#13;
extremely heavy fighting resulting in significant casualties. On June 18, 2000, the two&#13;
governments signed an Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities.&#13;
2.   The Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities was brokered by the Organization of&#13;
African Unity (OAU) with the support of the United Nations, the United States, and the&#13;
European Union. Under the terms of the Agreement, both parties agreed to cease all&#13;
military attacks and seek a resolution to their disputes through peaceful and legal means.&#13;
They also agreed to modalities of deployment, whereby Ethiopian troops would withdraw&#13;
to positions under their civil administration prior to May 6, 1998, while the Eritrean army&#13;
would maintain its troops at a distance of 25 km (defined as "artillery range") from&#13;
Ethiopian positions. An international peacekeeping force, sponsored by the United&#13;
Nations, would be established to patrol the area between the two re-deployed armies, to&#13;
monitor the implementation of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and to support&#13;
efforts to accommodate the return of displaced civilians in both countries.&#13;
3.   On September 15, 2000 the UN Security Council authorized the deployment of up&#13;
to 4,200 peacekeeping troops, including military observers to the region, and mandated&#13;
the mission till March 2001. It is expected that all the military observers will be deployed&#13;
shortly (some are already in place in both the countries). The redeployment of the&#13;
Ethiopian and Eritrean troops is expected to begin within two weeks of the deployment of&#13;
the peacekeeping troops. Eventually, an international body to be agreed by both countries&#13;
will lead the settlement of disputes.&#13;
4.  Prior to the war, the Government had reduced the size of military spending to less&#13;
than 3 percent of its GDP. As a direct consequence of the conflict with Eritrea, outlays&#13;
for defense expenditures increased to 13.3 percent of GDP and the armed forces are now&#13;
estimated to have increased about fourfold since 1998.&#13;
B.  Humanitarian Impact&#13;
5.   The main areas of tension during the conflict on the Ethiopian side, along the 1,000&#13;
km border between the two countries, were: (i) Badme and Sheraro, in the western border&#13;
area between the Tekezze and Mereb rivers (Western Zone of Tigray Region); (ii)&#13;
Tsorona, Zalambessa and Alitena in the central border section (Eastern Zone of Tigray&#13;
Region) near the main road leading from Ethiopia to the Eritrean capital of Asmara; and&#13;
(iii) Bure in the eastern border section (Zone 1 of the Afar Region) on the main road to&#13;
the Eritrean Red Sea port of Assab. These were among the main areas that people were&#13;
displaced from. According to the latest estimates provided by the Government of&#13;
Ethiopia, approximately 330,000 people were displaced in the Tigray Region and 34,000&#13;
from the Afar Region bringing the total number of Internally Displaced Peoples (IDPs) to&#13;
about 364,000. These IDPs include people who were living within artillery range of the&#13;
-1-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrean border and were displaced during May 1998-June 2000, either as a preventive&#13;
measure or as a result of fighting in their areas of origin, and who were unable to return&#13;
to their homes due to the presence of landmines and/or unexploded ordnance (UXO),&#13;
proximity of their homes to Eritrean forces, or because their homes, water supply, or&#13;
other essential resources and infrastructure were damaged or destroyed. These IDPs&#13;
remain in settlements or are integrated locally with host families in areas close to their&#13;
areas of origin, and are almost entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance. It is&#13;
estimated that almost 50 percent of the total IDP population may still be displaced.&#13;
6.   Another category of people include about 76,000 persons of Ethiopian origin who&#13;
had been residing in Eritrea and have returned/been deported from there as a result of the&#13;
conflict; another 33,000 are expected to come into Ethiopia in the near future which&#13;
would bring the total number of deportees/returnees to about 110,000. The overwhelming&#13;
majority of these returnees/deportees are women, children and the elderly who have&#13;
arrived with few possessions and most have no means of supporting themselves.&#13;
7.   The Government also considers the conflict-affected population to include those&#13;
families that as a result of civilian, including militia, war casualties, have lost their main&#13;
bread winner. According to the latest Government estimates, this amounts to about&#13;
36,000 civilians, including militia, who were bread winners and whose families (about&#13;
144,000 people) are, as a result, on the verge of destitution.&#13;
8.   In addition to the loss of agricultural production for the rural displaced population,&#13;
many of the displaced lost their other means of livelihood as well. Many people left their&#13;
homes with few personal belongings, and lost most of their livestock. Most were unable&#13;
to support themselves. Almost half of the displaced people from non-farm (urban') areas&#13;
had previously been permanently employed. The other half had been engaged in casual&#13;
labor and earned non-dependable income. Cross-border petty trade, which previously&#13;
made up a significant portion of the local economy in border areas and included livestock&#13;
sales as well as sales of vegetables, spices, etc. was completely suspended. This has&#13;
resulted in significantly reduced access to cash for the displaced and those living close to&#13;
the border.&#13;
9.   Apart from the stress created by the war environment, most of the displaced came&#13;
from areas that are chronically drought affected, and quite a few of them have been&#13;
dependent upon external assistance for a number of years. In areas where the displaced&#13;
have taken temporary shelter, they continue to place a heavy burden on host&#13;
communities. Two years of hosting the displaced has strained health, education, and&#13;
water and sanitation infrastructure in these areas. A lot of the host families, who were&#13;
already at the end of their coping strategies, have been relying upon assistance&#13;
themselves due to the fact that they suffered significant reduction in crop production due&#13;
to erratic distribution of rain during the 1999 meher (harvest) season. These host&#13;
communities have also been affected by the war and the closing of the border with Eritrea&#13;
to small-scale trade, and have few opportunities for income generation.&#13;
'The minimum population size for a non-farmn (urban) center in Ethiopia is 2,000.&#13;
-2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10. After the cessation of hostilities in June 2000, displaced civilians have started&#13;
returning to their homes, often in or next to hazardous areas contaminated by&#13;
landmines/UXO, in order to resume agricultural activities (mostly without official&#13;
sanction). In the last three months, for instance, health facilities in the Tigray region&#13;
received a greater number of civilian landmine/UXO casualties-among whom are a high&#13;
number of children and young adults -than in the previous twelve months. It is&#13;
suspected that more casualties are unreported since they occur far from health facilities&#13;
and are thus not treated. Also, some of the social infrastructure has been damaged and&#13;
schools, clinics and water supply schemes are in need of reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation. Roads and power supply facilities have also been damaged. In some areas,&#13;
houses have been damaged; building materials (particularly roof beams) have been taken&#13;
away to be used in the trenches.&#13;
11. The presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance from recent hostilities,&#13;
therefore, poses a significant risk throughout the conflict area, particularly in the "no&#13;
man's land" that runs between the trenches along the two confrontation lines (May 1998&#13;
and May-June 2000). Dense minefields containing a mix of anti-tank and anti-personnel&#13;
mines laid out more or less in "conventional patterns" contaminate trench lines.&#13;
Unmarked and possibly unrecorded nuisance minefields and point targets can also be&#13;
expected outside the trench lines throughout the conflict area. Ethiopia has reportedly&#13;
removed and/or destroyed a large number of mines during the conflict or immediately&#13;
thereafter. However, it does not have sufficient technical means to conduct mine&#13;
clearance to international humanitarian standards, and consequently a significant residual&#13;
risk remains. In addition, the risk of unexploded ordnance of conventional nature in the&#13;
former battle area is high. In light of the above, the mine/unexploded ordnance&#13;
contamination in areas adjacent to the Temporary Security Zone and in it would pose an&#13;
immediate threat to the safe deployment and operation of the UN peacekeeping mission,&#13;
as well as to the resident and returning populations and associated humanitarian relief&#13;
efforts. If unmitigated, it will impede post-emergency rehabilitation and reconstruction&#13;
efforts. The extent of the problem is beyond the current mine action capacities of the&#13;
country and requires substantial support from the international community.&#13;
12. As part of the peacekeeping operation, the United Nations Mine Action Service&#13;
(UNMAS) is preparing a mine action plan to help mitigate the threat posed by landmines&#13;
and unexploded ordnance. The U.K. Department for International Development (DflD)&#13;
has provided funding for an NGO, the Halo Trust, which is responsible for surveying the&#13;
Temporary Security Zone and adjacent areas along the border for landmines and UXO in&#13;
preparation for the deployment of the UN peacekeeping troops. At present the Ethiopian&#13;
De-mining Project (EDP), a non-combatant unit in the military together with two teams&#13;
from the Halo Trust, is undertaking this emergency landmine/UXO survey along the&#13;
border area between Ethiopia and Eritrea.The survey commenced in early October 2000&#13;
and is expected to take three months to complete.&#13;
13. Another area of concern is the increased risk of HIV/AIDS transmissions in the&#13;
war-affected communities and the armed forces. The concentration of such a large&#13;
number of relatively well-paid military personnel coupled with the inflow of commercial&#13;
sex workers and the establishment of informal family arrangements has exposed&#13;
communities in Tigray and Afar to considerable health risks. These risks have been&#13;
-3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
exacerbated by the ongoing re-deployment of military personnel in the vicinity of the&#13;
civilian population deeper inside Tigray following the Cessation of Hostilities&#13;
Agreement. Regular troops are generally bivouacked alongside communities rather than&#13;
confined to separate facilities or garrisons. This risk is compounded by the potential&#13;
spread of the disease to other parts of the country. The planned demobilization of war&#13;
veterans along with routine redeployment of active units of the armed forces to other&#13;
parts of the country further increases the risk of accelerated HIV/AIDS transmission rates&#13;
throughout the country.&#13;
C. Damage Assessment&#13;
14. The Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) at the Federal&#13;
government level has been coordinating the effort to assess the damage caused by the war&#13;
and mitigate its effects. Through its bureaus at the regional level, it has worked closely&#13;
with the regional governments in Tigray and Afar and various NGOs (such as the Relief&#13;
Society of Tigray) to determine the extent of the damage.&#13;
15. Direct damage and destruction due to the conflict took place in seven woredas in&#13;
Tigray and seven woredas in Afar bordering Eritrea. According to Government estimates,&#13;
the internally displaced people, in addition to their displacement, have lost their&#13;
properties including livestock, stored grains, production tools, household utensils, etc.&#13;
Their residential houses have either been destroyed by heavy artillery or set on fire.&#13;
Estimates of the actual magnitude of losses incurred by the IDPs require extensive survey&#13;
and field visits which have not been possible due to the presence of land mines and UXO&#13;
in many areas. Estimates in Table 1 below are, therefore, based on preliminary&#13;
assessments and certain assumptions. In addition, some social infrastructure such as&#13;
education, health, water supply and animal health facilities have been destroyed or&#13;
damaged. There has also been destruction and damage to commercial enterprises such as&#13;
flour mills, flour factories, hotels, shops, bars, bakeries, poultry farms, cattle fattening&#13;
centers, etc. Furthermore, government administrative buildings in certain areas as well as&#13;
religious institutions have been destroyed or damaged by the conflict. Apart from the&#13;
above, the border town of Zalambessa has been totally destroyed including houses,&#13;
commercial enterprises, water pipelines, power and telecommunication facilities, and&#13;
social infrastructure. Roads and bridges have been heavily destroyed or damaged both in&#13;
the war-affected areas as well as certain other parts of the country due to additional heavy&#13;
traffic movement to serve the war front. Power supply infrastructure has also been either&#13;
destroyed or damaged in the war-affected areas. The estimated cost of destroyed public&#13;
and social infrastructure is well over US$200 million.&#13;

D. Economic Impact&#13;
16. The consequences of the war on the overall economy have been significant. After&#13;
two decades of falling per capita income during the Derg regime, peace combined with&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization and reforms led to GDP growth averaging some 6 percent&#13;
per annum since 1992. Consumer price inflation averaged 3.3 percent a year during&#13;
1992-99 and domestic bank financing of the fiscal deficit turned negative in 1994-95 and&#13;
remained so until 1997-98. The fiscal deficit (including grants) fell from 8.5 percent of&#13;
GDP during 1991-92 to about 2 percent during 1997-98. This period also saw a major&#13;
reorientation of public expenditure from defense to social sectors and vital infrastructure.&#13;
17. These favorable trends began to be reversed with the outbreak of the conflict in&#13;
May 1998. Defense spending which had reached a low of 2.5 percent of GDP in 1996-97&#13;
rose to 8.7 percent in 1998-99 and as high as 13.3 percent in 1999-00. Consequently, the&#13;
-5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
fiscal deficit had risen to 6.9 percent in 1998-99 and to almost 12 percent in 1999-00.&#13;
The preemptive demands of defense expenditure over the last two years were financed by&#13;
cuts in discretionary recurrent expenditure and in capital expenditure. Capital&#13;
expenditures which had steadily grown to 10.4 percent of GDP in 1996-97 had slipped to&#13;
6.7 percent in 1999-00.&#13;
18. The burden of the conflict is exacting a progressively heavier toll on private sector&#13;
development. Economic uncertainty and balance of payments constraints have eroded&#13;
investor confidence in general as evidenced by the significant fall in new investments that&#13;
have commenced operations. Data drawn from the Ethiopian Investment Authority&#13;
indicate that these fell from a high of 2.9 billion birr in 1997-98 to 1.1 billion birr in&#13;
1998-99 and to 0.5 billion birr in the first nine months of 1999-00. Finally, the balance&#13;
of payments came under severe pressure with foreign exchange reserves declining by&#13;
nearly $100 million between 1998-99 and 1999-00, bringing import cover to as low as&#13;
two months. The government prevented any sharp depreciation in the exchange rate&#13;
through a number of controls and non-price barriers, further impairing private sector&#13;
activity.&#13;
E.  Government Response&#13;
19. The Federal Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission has taken the lead&#13;
in responding to the emergency needs arising from the war and has worked in close&#13;
cooperation with the regional sector bureaus such as health, water, education, agriculture,&#13;
and its regional bureau of disaster prevention and preparedness in the two regional&#13;
administrations in Tigray and Afar, along with national and international NGOs. The&#13;
DPPC has played a central role in organizing and coordinating joint needs assessment&#13;
with the UN Country Team, NGOs, and donors, and is responsible for preparing&#13;
consolidated appeals for international assistance and managing the allocation and&#13;
delivery of relief resources.&#13;
20. In the Tigray Region, assistance to the displaced is coordinated by the Tigray&#13;
Emergency Coordination Committee, which is composed of the Regional Government&#13;
Administration including its sectoral bureaus, the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness&#13;
Bureau (DPPB) and relevant NGOs. In the Afar Region, most of the displaced who were&#13;
living near Bure and Elidar have been served through the Regional Administration as&#13;
well as some local and international NGOs and indirectly by a few of the UN agencies.&#13;
21. The Government has also been providing assistance to the deportees/returnees from&#13;
Eritrea through a national fund which it administers, chaired by the DPPC Commissioner,&#13;
with contribution from Ethiopians inside the country and in the Diaspora. The&#13;
deportees/returnees have been provided with food, clothing, drugs and other basic needs&#13;
in transit centers (in most cases, school buildings). While some of the deportees are still&#13;
living in transit centers, others (about 21,837 people) have been facilitated to return to&#13;
regions of their choice to settle in. This has been done with the provision of a basic&#13;
reintegration package comprising cash, food and other basic necessities such as essential&#13;
household goods. However, this has not been enough to re-establish their livelihoods and&#13;
the Government has appealed for external assistance.&#13;
-6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22. The Government has also undertaken some initial de-mining operations in the&#13;
conflict zones through the Ethiopian De-mining Project, a non-combatant unit in the&#13;
military.&#13;
23. Following the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, the Government has approached&#13;
the Bank-on an emergency basis-for assistance in putting together a comprehensive&#13;
package of interventions to cope with the aftermath of the conflict on the country. The&#13;
Government's proposal for assistance to rehabilitate the war-affected areas and people&#13;
includes providing housing reconstruction and basic household goods for IDPs in the&#13;
war-affected areas and income generation support including agricultural and business&#13;
development inputs for IDPs, deportees/returnees and families of deceased primary bread&#13;
winners throughout the country, reconstruction and rehabilitation of health and education&#13;
facilities with attendant inputs such as drugs, books, etc., and rehabilitation and&#13;
reconstruction of potable water supply facilities, animal health facilities, road&#13;
infrastructure, bridges, and power supply infrastructure.&#13;
F.  International Response&#13;
24. The DPPC issued its Appeal for the Year 2000 for Victims of Natural Disasters and&#13;
Internally Displaced Persons on January 21, 2000 which outlined a program of assistance&#13;
for the displaced, which included relief food aid as well as shelter, water and sanitation,&#13;
health care, education, and livestock support. In support of the Governnent's appeal the&#13;
UN Country Team subsequently issued an appeal and relief action plan with proposals&#13;
for US$27.5 million in combined food and non-food assistance for the IDPs. As of June&#13;
2000, donor response to this request amounted to US$19.7 million meeting 80 percent of&#13;
the food requirements but only 22 percent of the non-food requirements. The non-food&#13;
assistance included construction and rehabilitation of water points, emergency education&#13;
assistance, provision of medical supplies, distribution of shelter materials, mine risk&#13;
education, and agricultural interventions. An Updated Appeal for Rehabilitation and&#13;
Recovery Programmes for the Internally Displaced Persons was issued by the UN&#13;
Country Team on August 22, 2000. Like the January 2000 appeal, it is intended to&#13;
supplement the Government's ongoing efforts to provide assistance to the displaced&#13;
population and is projected to cover the period from September 2000 to January 2001.&#13;
The additional funds requested total US$15.1 million for food assistance and US$15.3&#13;
million in non-food assistance to meet the most critical and urgent needs.&#13;
25. A joint UN office has been maintained in Mekele (capital of the Tigray Region)&#13;
since March 1999 with the full time presence of WFP and UNICEF, supported by UNDP.&#13;
The WFP has been providing assistance to 272,000 people displaced by the conflict since&#13;
April 1999. Since July 2000, food distributions were extended to an additional 15,500&#13;
newly displaced. So far the United States has been the largest donor of relief food to&#13;
assist IDPs and returning populations. In 1999, the European Union, Ireland, Canada,&#13;
Japan, the Netherlands and Norway all contributed to the emergency operation. The water&#13;
and environmental sanitation needs of IDPs who are unable to return and remain&#13;
displaced are being addressed from the funds received from the UN Country Team appeal&#13;
of January 2000. Basic shelter assistance has also been provided to about 4,000&#13;
IDP/returnee families by UNICEF since May 2000. The UN Country Team has also&#13;
initiated a series of studies and actions in the Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) sector&#13;
-7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
since June 1999 to mitigate the landmine and UXO threat to civilians. Since October&#13;
1999, UNICEF has provided technical support to a landmine and UXO awareness project&#13;
targeting displaced populations in the Tigray Region. The Relief and Development&#13;
Organization, a local NGO, together with the Tigray Regional Authorities have&#13;
implemented this project. UNDP has provided a platform for collaborative action,&#13;
presenting an HMA Strategy paper to the Government of Ethiopia. It has also provided&#13;
technical assistance to the Conflict Management Center of the OAU, the Ethiopian De-&#13;
mining Project, the Ethiopian Physiotherapists Association, and the Prosthetic Orthopedic&#13;
Centre and has carried out field studies on the nature of the landmines/UXO pollution and&#13;
the implications of these threats to Ethiopian civilians and the UN/OAU peace support&#13;
mission.&#13;
26. With regard to USAID, in May 2000 a Disaster Assistance Response Team was set&#13;
up in Ethiopia to coordinate and manage the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance&#13;
response to the drought emergency. Since the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities&#13;
Agreement between the two countries, and the earliest movements of the IDPs back to&#13;
their homes, the Disaster Assistance Response Team has also begun to prepare for&#13;
providing humanitarian (non-food) assistance for rehabilitation of conflict-affected areas&#13;
and populations. It is understood that within the USAID Ethiopia office, efforts are&#13;
underway to identify areas in which, with Government approval, resources from current&#13;
projects in health, population and nutrition, human and institutional development, and&#13;
agriculture and natural resources could be reprogrammed to meet the most urgent&#13;
rehabilitation needs arising from the conflict.&#13;
II. IDA RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
A.  Elements of IDA Response&#13;
27. After registering encouraging progress through the mid-90s, the Ethiopian&#13;
economy experienced significant setbacks in the past two years due to the cumulative&#13;
impact of the war and a multi-year drought. Underlying these immediate difficulties are&#13;
the persistent challenges associated with transforming the economy of one of the world's&#13;
poorest agricultural economies, and the added burden of an AIDS epidemic that has&#13;
already caused widespread suffering and threatens the integrity of Ethiopia's economic&#13;
and social fabric.&#13;
28. The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), in 1997, had led to a major increase in&#13;
the lending program in support of a government that was seen to be implementing a&#13;
coherent and well-sequenced poverty strategy. This lending program was underpinned by&#13;
sector investment programs in roads, health and education and with major investments in&#13;
agriculture and power. The Bank's initial reaction to the outbreak of the conflict with&#13;
Eritrea in May 1998 was to continue programs in both countries with the expectation that&#13;
the dispute would soon be resolved. However, as this did not happen and following&#13;
intense fighting in February 1999, the Bank decided in April 1999 to defer all new&#13;
lending to both countries. The Bank continued to be fully engaged in both countries&#13;
through non-lending assistance and preparation of lending operations. Disbursements on&#13;
the existing portfolios continued as did routine supervision missions for all projects.&#13;
-8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
However, implementation in some key areas, notably the health and education sector&#13;
programs, slipped considerably.&#13;
29. The Bank's objective in the immediate post-war period is to help the country deal&#13;
as quickly as possible with the human, material and financial destabilization caused by&#13;
the war, while simultaneously re-engaging on core development issues. An Interim&#13;
Support Strategy is being presented to the Board with this operation to describe the&#13;
Bank's strategy in greater detail for the post-conflict transition over the next twelve to&#13;
twenty four months. This strategy is designed to:&#13;
* address the immediate human, infrastructure and economic emergency, and to set the&#13;
economy back on a path of sustainable economic growth;&#13;
* tackle weaknesses in the management of the IDA portfolio, which have accumulated&#13;
during the war, and which require urgent attention if an ambitious program of new&#13;
interventions is to succeed; and&#13;
* initiate long-term Bank assistance in three areas of critical structural importance in&#13;
the Ethiopian economy-food insecurity, the spread of HIV/AIDS, and systemic&#13;
weaknesses in Ethiopia's capacity to produce and deliver essential services.&#13;
30. Four emergency operations are currently under preparation. These projects would&#13;
provide up to US$700 million in new IDA credits to address the impact of the conflict: an&#13;
Emergency Recovery Project (US$230 million) to help the war-affected people to rebuild&#13;
their lives and resume productive economic activities, reconstruct and rehabilitate&#13;
destroyed and damaged infrastructure to restart the provision of services and support&#13;
macro-economic stability in the country; an Emergency Demobilization and&#13;
Reintegration Project (US$170 million) to demobilize and reintegrate 150,000 veterans;&#13;
an Emergency Support Credit (US$250 million) yet to be prepared to support the&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization program agreed upon with the Fund and help put Ethiopia&#13;
back on a sustainable growth path by addressing specific policy constraints; and a&#13;
Fertilizer Supplemental Credit (US$50 million) to sustain food production.&#13;
31. In addition to focussing on immediate emergency needs and on tackling the&#13;
institutional underpinnings of IDA portfolio management, the Bank's interim strategy in&#13;
FY01 /02 will address three key medium-term issues-food insecurity and agricultural&#13;
inputs, HIV/AIDS and weak institutions/inadequate human capacity. Improving the&#13;
management of the IDA portfolio was begun in October 2000 with a joint Government-&#13;
Bank Country Portfolio Performance Review and a joint review of the Sector&#13;
Development Programs for Health and Education to identify weaknesses and develop an&#13;
action plan to improve implementation.&#13;
32. The Bank is also re-engaging in the critical area of HIV/AIDS (US$59.7 million for&#13;
EMSAP was approved by the Board in September 2000), and accelerating the preparation&#13;
of a food security project. The Government is preparing an Interim Poverty Reduction&#13;
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) in collaboration with the Bank and the IMF, currently scheduled&#13;
to be considered by the Boards of the Bank and the Fund in late December 2000. The&#13;
balance of payments support credit under preparation will support this strategy. Finally,&#13;
the staff of the Bank and the Fund are also preparing a HIPC Decision Point document&#13;
-9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
which could be considered by the Boards of the two institutions in late December along&#13;
with the I-PRSP.&#13;
B.  Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
33. The Emergency Recovery Project would address the immediate needs of the war-&#13;
affected people (about 620,000 people). It would also help the country restart its&#13;
economy. The Bank's involvement is justified by the amount of resources required, the&#13;
sustainable development focus of the Project, and the need to monitor the macro-&#13;
economic impact of the Emergency Recovery Program.&#13;
C.  Lessons Learned from the Previous Ethiopia Emergency Recovery and&#13;
Reconstruction Project&#13;
34.  An Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction Project (Cr. 2351-ET) was provided&#13;
to the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) in March 1992 for an amount of&#13;
US$150 million equivalent. The Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction Project was&#13;
part of the multi-donor financed Economic Recovery and Reconstruction Program, which&#13;
was prepared to reverse the social and economic situation resulting from almost two&#13;
decades of devastating civil war and economic mismanagement that the TGE inherited&#13;
when it came to power in May 1991. The overall Economic Recovery and Reconstruction&#13;
Program was co-financed by the TGE, several multilateral and bilateral donors, and&#13;
reallocation from existing IDA credits. The project was financed with a new credit from&#13;
IDA (Cr. 235 1-ET) which was designed to cover the part of the Economic Recovery and&#13;
Reconstruction Program for which no funds were available from the rest of the donor&#13;
community and ongoing IDA projects. About US$80.7 million was reallocated from&#13;
seven existing IDA credits to finance some parts of the overall Program. The overall IDA&#13;
contribution to the Program, therefore, amounted to US$230.7 million.&#13;
35.  The broad objectives of the project and the overall Program were to assist Ethiopia&#13;
to jump-start its economic and social recovery and to lay the basis for the follow-up&#13;
adjustment program. The specific objectives of the project were to support: (i)&#13;
reconstruction of roads, power, telecommunications, and civil aviation facilities as well&#13;
as rehabilitation of social infrastructure at the community level; (ii) inputs for public&#13;
industrial enterprises and construction materials; and (iii) road transportation and&#13;
petroleum products.&#13;
36.  Overall, the Implementation Completion Report of the project notes that the project&#13;
has achieved its objectives satisfactorily and that these achievements are sustainable. The&#13;
economy substantially recovered-in the four years ending 1994/95. GDP at constant&#13;
factor grew by 64 percent, and all sectors in which the project participated have been&#13;
growing. The importation of goods financed from the proceeds of the credit has assisted&#13;
the Government to rehabilitate, reconstruct, maintain, and operate priority sectors of its&#13;
economy damaged by the civil war. In the social sector, the Social Fund succeeded in&#13;
rehabilitating social infrastructure for about 2.1 million of the poorest and most&#13;
vulnerable population.&#13;
-10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37. The key lessons learnt from this project were:&#13;
* Commitment and ownership of the borrower is critical for the successful&#13;
implementation of emergency recovery projects.&#13;
+ Staff of implementing agencies need to be trained early in procurement and&#13;
disbursement procedures with periodic refresher courses during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
* The Bank should be flexible and ready to review its procedures for procurement and&#13;
disbursement since in an emergency situation speed of implementation is as critical as&#13;
accountability.&#13;
+ Delegation of authority to a dedicated and well-equipped Project Management Unit&#13;
under a strong manager with proven record and motivated staff, coupled with an&#13;
action-oriented Inter-sectoral Committee proved to be an effective administrative&#13;
arrangement.&#13;
* Programs under the full control of communities are more likely to be sustainable.&#13;
* The smaller regravelling contracts of the roads component would have been better&#13;
suited to domestic contractors or Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) force account&#13;
units rather than ICB (international competitive bidding) contracts.&#13;
D.  Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement in De-mining Projects&#13;
38. Lessons learned from previous experience with de-mining projects suggest that the&#13;
Bank should: (i) have a clear plan to ensure that rehabilitation activities are undertaken&#13;
only where de-mining has been completed; (ii) ensure that experienced quality assurance&#13;
is part of mine clearing; and (iii) given the Bank's limited expertise in de-mining, involve&#13;
relevant international organizations.&#13;
III. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A.  Program Objectives&#13;
39. The overall objectives of the Emergency Recovery Program are to assist the&#13;
Government of Ethiopia to:&#13;
+ help the war-affected people to rebuild their lives and resume productive economic&#13;
activities;&#13;
* reconstruct and rehabilitate destroyed and damaged infrastructure to restart the&#13;
provision of services; and&#13;
* support macro-economic stability in the country.&#13;
40. Specifically, the Emergency Recovery Program would support the following key&#13;
activities:&#13;
* help the internally displaced people, deported/returned population and the households&#13;
of casualties of war who were the main bread winners to rebuild their lives and&#13;
resume productive economic activities; and rapidly rehabilitate and reconstruct&#13;
destroyed and damaged social infrastructure in the war-affected areas in order to&#13;
resume the provision and efficient and effective delivery of basic services;&#13;
-11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support for the civilian population in the war-affected&#13;
areas;&#13;
* humanitarian de-mining of war-affected areas in order to enable the return of the&#13;
displaced population and the rehabilitation of their homes and livelihoods; and&#13;
* rehabilitate road, bridge and power supply infrastructure that were damaged as an&#13;
indirect consequence of the war.&#13;
B.   Program Coverage and Implementation Period&#13;
41. Program activities would essentially be spread across those areas that were most&#13;
affected by the war. These include seven woredas2 in the Tigray Region namely Irope,&#13;
Golomahada, Ganta Afshome, Aheferom, Mereblehe, Tahati Adiabo, and Kafta-Humera&#13;
and seven woredas in the Afar Region i.e., Elidar, Dallol, Berhele, Afdera, Arefti, Manda&#13;
and Bure. In addition, interventions related to addressing other damages of the war, i.e.,&#13;
dispersal of the deportees/returnees, households that lost their primary bread winner (i.e.,&#13;
civilian, including militia, casualties), accelerated damage to road infrastructure, and&#13;
damages to the power supply infrastructure, would also cover other parts of the country.&#13;
42. The Program will be implemented over a period of three years from January 2001&#13;
through December 2003.&#13;
C.   Program Costing and Financing&#13;
43. Program Costing and Financing Plan: The Government's overall Emergency&#13;
Recovery Program is estimated to cost US$555 million, of which IDA would finance&#13;
US$260 million made up of US$230 million to be provided through a new credit and&#13;
US$30 million to be reallocated from existing IDA credits to cater to the emergency&#13;
requirements. The Emergency Recovery Project consists of the IDA credit of US$230&#13;
million and the Government's counterpart contribution of US$13.1 million bringing the&#13;
total project cost to US$243.1 million.&#13;
44. Counterpart funding requirements from the Government were limited to US$13.1&#13;
million by excluding counterpart funding requirements for the quick disbursing category.&#13;
The counterpart financing will, therefore, come mainly from in-kind community&#13;
contributions for the household rehabilitation component, in-kind project management&#13;
and support, and from payments for a part of the civil works under the road&#13;
rehabilitation/improvement component.&#13;
2 The administrative structure in Ethiopia at the regional and sub-regional levels of government is as&#13;
follows:&#13;
- At the regional level, there is a Regional Government Administration. For administrative purposes, a&#13;
region is divided into zones, woredas, and kebeles.&#13;
- Below the regional administration is the zone which has the zonal administration authorities.&#13;
- Below the zone is the woreda (or district) which has the woreda administration authorities.&#13;
- Below the woreda is a kebele (known as a tabia in the Tigray Region) which is the lowest&#13;
administrative authority in the regional government hierarchy.&#13;
-12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45. The new credit (US$230 million) will finance the following components:&#13;
household rehabilitation (for IDPs in Tigray, deportees/returnees, and families of&#13;
deceased bread winners), de-mining, and roads. The proceeds from reallocations of&#13;
existing credits (total of US$30 million) will finance the following components:&#13;
household rehabilitation (for IDPs in Afar) and community infrastructure (US$17.5&#13;
million from the ESRDF), HIV/AIDS (US$2.5 million from EMSAP), and power&#13;
(US$10 million from Energy II).&#13;
46. The Government expressed its intention of seeing the Emergency Recovery&#13;
Program as an umbrella program to be financed by a multiplicity of donors. It is expected&#13;
that other multilateral and bilateral development partners will finance the gap between the&#13;
Program cost and the IDA contribution through parallel financing or co-financing from&#13;
reprogramming of their existing portfolios and from newly committed funds in the future.&#13;

D. Rationale for ERP Design&#13;
47. As noted in the Project objectives there are two related aspects to the Emergency&#13;
Recovery Program: (i) macro-economic stability; and (ii) restoration of people's homes&#13;
-13-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and means of production. The Project harmonizes these two requirements by providing&#13;
foreign exchange for the purchase of goods based on a positive list of imports as is the&#13;
standard procedure for emergency recovery credits and by the deposit of the local&#13;
currency proceeds from the sale of this foreign exchange into an Emergency Recovery&#13;
Program Fund Account to be utilized for the household rehabilitation component. Similar&#13;
arrangements are proposed to finance the benefit packages of soldiers that are&#13;
demobilized under the Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project.&#13;
48. A link between the quick disbursing component and the implementation of the&#13;
household rehabilitation component will be maintained through the phasing of the quick&#13;
disbursing component. Approximately 40 percent of the component will be disbursed&#13;
initially to the Government. Additional funds will be made available to the Government&#13;
in two more phases, in each case after the Government has provided IDA with:&#13;
* a list of eligible beneficiaries identifying the amount of funds for each and the agreed&#13;
goods and services to be acquired by each eligible beneficiary;&#13;
* verification that a sample of the eligible beneficiaries (to be agreed between the&#13;
Government and IDA) have received their payments in accordance with the certified&#13;
list; and&#13;
* verification that a sample of the eligible beneficiaries (to be agreed between the&#13;
Government and IDA) have acquired the goods and services intended.&#13;
In addition, the Government will not later than the first quarter of Project&#13;
implementation, and quarterly thereafter, carry out a review of activities under the&#13;
household rehabilitation component, submit to IDA, and act upon the findings and&#13;
recommendations of the review.&#13;
49. Scope of IDA Assistance for Household Rehabilitation: The Government has&#13;
identified an indicative minimum package of assets and inputs necessary for individual&#13;
households' subsistence and economic activity. The Government has further identified the&#13;
eligible beneficiary groups i.e. all IDPs, deportees/returnees and households with&#13;
deceased bread winners and costed the Program on the assumption that all beneficiaries&#13;
would require the entire package of support. However, it is possible that individual&#13;
households may already possess some of the assets and inputs identified in the package.&#13;
This could only be confirmed through detailed beneficiary assessments which would&#13;
validate the actual "financing gap" at the household level and might also reveal&#13;
divergences between the indicative minimum package and specific household preferences&#13;
and choices. Such surveys would take considerable time and would militate against the&#13;
emergency nature of the Program and the need to move rapidly to restore productive&#13;
activities. Consequently, the approach that has been adopted is to establish the average&#13;
minimum financing gap-about 50 per cent-that is expected to prevail at the household&#13;
level. This level of financing would then be provided as indicative budget constraints to&#13;
affected communities which would subsequently establish priorities for household&#13;
emergency rehabilitation within the communities. During the process of allocating&#13;
financial resources within a community the remaining household needs would be&#13;
identified and donor financing sought by the Government to bridge the "gap".&#13;
-14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50. Safeguards to Ensure the Proper Use of Funds under Household Rehabilitation: To&#13;
the extent possible, benefit packages would be disbursed in cash payments by local&#13;
government representatives to individual households. There will be three important&#13;
safeguards built into the process to ensure that the funds are utilized for the purposes&#13;
intended. First, there will be a comprehensive system of verification at the woreda level&#13;
and below. This system of community monitoring already exists and has been utilized in&#13;
the recent past; for example, the Regional Government of Tigray has been providing cash&#13;
and inputs to 18,300 households after July 2000 and has utilized the woreda and tabia&#13;
structures to ensure that the cash was used for the purposes intended. In this instance, the&#13;
tabia Rehabilitation Task Force (RTF) along with the tabia baito3 would be responsible&#13;
for: (a) monitoring and verification of the use of the allocated funds to the beneficiary&#13;
households; and (b) submitting an implementation report and initiation of the next steps&#13;
in rehabilitation assistance to the woreda. Second, given that a substantial portion of the&#13;
households are dependent on food assistance and could potentially use the cash for&#13;
consumption purposes, the Government, with the assistance of bilateral and multilateral&#13;
partners, will ensure the availability of sufficient food assistance at the time that the cash&#13;
payments are provided for rehabilitation activities. Third, for certain assets and inputs,&#13;
e.g., where the availability of sufficient supply might be problematic and result in&#13;
shortages or price increases, the Government will take proactive steps to encourage&#13;
and/or ensure sufficient supply response from the private sector. The Government and&#13;
IDA have agreed that the situation will be closely monitored during implementation to&#13;
ensure that the funds are utilized for the purposes intended.&#13;
51. The remaining Project components such as de-mining, road&#13;
rehabilitation/improvement and institutional strengthening would be disbursed using&#13;
traditional IDA disbursement mechanisms.&#13;
52. The Government will actively discourage people from returning to their homes&#13;
until they are declared safe from mines and UXO and will ensure that the household&#13;
rehabilitation component in the war-affected areas strictly follow an implementation plan&#13;
that allows people to return only to areas that are declared safe. The household&#13;
rehabilitation component would continue only as long as de-mining done according to&#13;
international humanitarian standards, as confirmed by an independent quality control&#13;
unit, precedes resettlement of displaced persons in areas determined by the current de-&#13;
mining survey to be unsafe for civilian occupation.&#13;
53.  The community infrastructure, HIV/AIDS and the power rehabilitation components&#13;
will use existing accounts, resources and procedures as outlined in the Development&#13;
Credit Agreements (DCA) for the three projects from which funds are being reallocated&#13;
i.e., ESRDF, EMSAP and Energy II.&#13;
54. Conditions of Credit Effectiveness: The following are the conditions which would&#13;
need to be fulfilled by the Government before the Credit can be declared effective:&#13;
3 Baito is the local council at tabia level in the Tigray Region.&#13;
-15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* the Borrower has established a financial management and accounting system for the&#13;
de-mining and institutional development components of the Project in the Emergency&#13;
Recovery Program Management Unit (ERPMU), acceptable to IDA;&#13;
+ the Borrower has adopted a Project Implementation Plan - PIP (the PIP would include&#13;
details of procurement and disbursement arrangements, performance indicators and&#13;
other administrative, financial and organizational arrangements) in form and&#13;
substance satisfactory to IDA;&#13;
* the Borrower has established the ERP Fund Account; and&#13;
+ the Borrower has established the ERPMU and the Tigray Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU), with the key staff as specified in paragraph 2 of Schedule 4 of the DCA.&#13;
E.  Overall Program Implementation Arrangements&#13;
55. The Program will be managed, coordinated and implemented by an Emergency&#13;
Recovery Program Management Unit housed in MEDaC and accountable to the Minister,&#13;
MEDaC. The ERPMU will be responsible for collating information from the respective&#13;
regions on overall implementation progress of the Program, facilitating action to resolve&#13;
constraints and expedite implementation, keeping a record of disbursements, and carrying&#13;
out ex-post expenditure reviews. The ERPMU will also undertake, through its&#13;
procurement unit, the non-community based procurement (for de-mining, etc.). The&#13;
ERPMU will be staffed by a senior manager, procurement specialists, financial manager&#13;
and accountants, and lead persons for each component including household rehabilitation&#13;
inside the war-affected areas, household rehabilitation outside the war-affected areas,&#13;
community infrastructure, HIV/AIDS, road and power rehabilitation and reconstruction,&#13;
and de-mining. The Financial Manager will supervise the operation of the Special&#13;
Account (for de-mining and other imported goods ) and the local currency account of the&#13;
Project.&#13;
Household Rehabilitation Component&#13;
56. The ERP is a Federal Government program but will be implemented in each region&#13;
with institutional arrangements tailored to the types and numbers of beneficiaries.&#13;
Coordination of Program activities in the Tigray and Afar regions will be as follows.&#13;
There will be a Program Management Unit (PMU) at the regional level which will be&#13;
responsible for overall Program management and monitoring and will be accountable to&#13;
the President of the Regional Council and through him to the Federal ERPMU.&#13;
57. Tigray Region: The Program Management Unit would manage the implementation&#13;
of the Rehabilitation Component in collaboration with the participating woredas for the&#13;
household rehabilitation component and ESRDF for the community infrastructure&#13;
component. The PMU in Tigray would be headed by an experienced project manager and&#13;
staffed by a procurement officer and at least three project officers. In addition a Financial&#13;
Management Unit (FMU) within the Finiance Bureau would be staffed by a financial&#13;
manager and at least one accountant. Each of the seven participating woredas in the&#13;
Tigray Region would use the Rehabilitation Task Force (RTF) at the woreda level (that&#13;
has already been set up in the region to deal with the post-conflict emergency)&#13;
-16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
comprising the woreda chairman, woreda staff of the relevant regional bureaus (such as&#13;
agriculture, works and urban development, and labor and social affairs), and women and&#13;
youth associations. Also, each woreda would establish an ERP Unit by appointing/hiring&#13;
a woreda program coordinator, at least two field tearns that would provide training and&#13;
back-up support to the tabia baitos (i.e., tabia councils), and an accountant to supervise&#13;
disbursements and keep financial records. At the tabia-level in each participating tabia,&#13;
the Rehabilitation Task Force (which has also been established) and consists of the&#13;
chairman of the tabia baito, the Development Agent4, representatives of women and&#13;
youth associations, and community representatives from the kushet5 would be used.&#13;
58. Afar Region: The Afar Regional Administration would establish a coordination&#13;
committee to guide and monitor the program. The Regional ESRDF Office would serve&#13;
as a PMU for the implementation of the household rehabilitation sub-component.&#13;
59. Other Regions: The Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission would be&#13;
the Federal coordinating and management body for the household rehabilitation&#13;
component for the deportees/returnees and families of deceased civilians including militia&#13;
in the other regions. The DPPC would report to the ERPMU. Regional PMUs would be&#13;
set up in the other regions as required to implement this component. The PMUs could be&#13;
located in relevant regional bureaus and may involve zonal and woreda finance offices&#13;
depending upon the local government level at which the majority of beneficiaries reside.&#13;
After deportees/returnees and families of deceased civilians including militia have been&#13;
identified, the relevant Regional Administrations will propose a strategy for working with&#13;
them in their communities similar to that described for Tigray and Afar.&#13;
60. Monitoring: The process of reconfirmation of beneficiaries, verification of benefit&#13;
packages, flow of funds to the beneficiaries and verification of the use of funds for&#13;
purposes intended would be implemented in accordance with the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan. Within six months after the deposit of funds into the Emergency Recovery Program&#13;
Fund Account, and semi-annually thereafter the Government would submit to IDA: a list&#13;
of beneficiaries identifying the amount of funds to be disbursed to each beneficiary and&#13;
the goods and services which the beneficiaries have agreed to purchase with the funds&#13;
provided; verification that a sample of the beneficiaries have received cash payments in&#13;
line with the certified list; and verification that a sample of the beneficiaries who have&#13;
received cash have utilized the funds for the purposes intended.&#13;
Community Infrastructure Component&#13;
61. For this activity, the financing will come from the reallocated proceeds of the&#13;
ESRDF Credit (Cr. 2841 -ET). The ESRDF through its Regional Office in both the Tigray&#13;
and Afar Regions will be responsible for the implementation of these activities.&#13;
HIV/AIDS Component&#13;
62.  This component will be financed from the Ethiopia Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS&#13;
Project (Cr. 3416-ET) and will follow the implementation modalities that have been&#13;
agreed between the Government and the Bank under EMSAP. The management and&#13;
4 Staff from the Bureau of Agriculture are responsible for agricultural extension activities.&#13;
5 A Kushet is a group of villages that make up a tabia.&#13;
-17-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
coordination of this component, therefore, will be the responsibility of the regional&#13;
HIV/AIDS secretariat. The implementation of the activities under the component will be&#13;
the responsibility of the local units of the regional sector bureaus namely health,&#13;
education, agriculture, trade, industry and transport, tourism, culture and information, the&#13;
army, local HIV/AIDS Boards, NGOs and the private sector.&#13;
De-mining Component&#13;
63. The ERPMU would be the decision-making and oversight authority for the de-&#13;
mining component. It would supervise the implementation of de-mining and be&#13;
responsible for ensuring that the activities are carried out in accordance with international&#13;
standards, based on independent monitoring and verification by a quality assurance unit&#13;
within the ERPMU. The mine clearance activities would be undertaken by the Ethiopian&#13;
De-mining Project (a non-combatant unit in the military) under contract to the ERPMU.&#13;
The ERPMU and the EDP will work together to coordinate de-mining activities in the&#13;
war-affected areas with the household rehabilitation sub-component.&#13;
Rehabilitation/Improvement of Road Infrastructure&#13;
64. Activities related to this sub-component would be managed and implemented by&#13;
the Ethiopian Roads Authority which has the requisite technical and managerial capacity&#13;
to undertake this work. ERA will do this in coordination with the relevant Regional Rural&#13;
Roads Authorities. In this context, ERA would function under the broad guidance of the&#13;
Federal and relevant regional governments.&#13;
Rehabilitation/Reconstruction of Power Supply Infrastructure&#13;
65. This sub-component will be financed from a reallocation from the ongoing Energy&#13;
II Project (Cr. 3019-ET) and its implementation will be carried out by the Ethiopian&#13;
Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo).&#13;
Component Description and Implementation Arrangements&#13;

APPENDIX 1A: HOUSEHOLD REHABILITATION&#13;
67.  The overall objective of the rehabilitation component is to provide assistance to the&#13;
war-affected population in order to rebuild their lives and resume productive economic&#13;
activities and have access to basic services. This would be achieved through the&#13;
following two sub-components: (a) household rehabilitation to include housing&#13;
reconstruction and provision of basic household goods for IDPs in the war-affected areas&#13;
and income generation support including agricultural and business development inputs&#13;
for IDPs, deportees/returnees and families of deceased primary bread winners throughout&#13;
the country; and (b) rehabilitation of community infrastructure such as education, health,&#13;
water supply and animal health facilities.&#13;
68.  Component Cost: The amount that will be financed through the Program for the&#13;
household rehabilitation component is US$1 18.8 million with US$116.5 million to be&#13;
financed through this Project and US$2.3 million from reallocated funds from the&#13;
ESRDF. Of the US$116.5 million from this Project, IDA will finance about US$ 110&#13;
million and the Government US$6.6 million through community contributions.&#13;
69. The following benefit packages for the household rehabilitation component and&#13;
corresponding implementation arrangements including provisions for procurement and&#13;
financial management are described in this appendix.&#13;
* Agriculture Rehabilitation Assistance for Farming Households in the Tigray Region&#13;
+ Housing Reconstruction Assistance for Farming and Urban Households in the Tigray&#13;
Region&#13;
* Agriculture Rehabilitation Assistance for Pastoralist and Farming Households in the Afar&#13;
Region&#13;
i Housing Reconstruction Assistance for Pastoralist, Farming and Urban Households in the&#13;
Afar Region&#13;
i Income Generation Assistance for Urban Households throughout the Country&#13;
70.  The costing of the rehabilitation assistance packages was based on an indicative&#13;
analysis by the Government on the level of assistance required to restore productive&#13;
capacity and reconstruct houses; actual choices by individual households may vary from&#13;
the packages discussed below.&#13;
71. The average rehabilitation assistance package for all categories of beneficiary&#13;
households financed under the Project is Birr 2,400 (except for housing reconstruction&#13;
assistance which will be provided to only those IDPs who have had their homes&#13;
destroyed or damaged). Maximum ceilings have been set for the different categories of&#13;
beneficiary families. For IDPs this is Birr 5,000, for deportees/returnees it is Birr 6,000&#13;
and for the families of deceased civilians including militia, this would amount to a&#13;
maximum cash payment of Birr 10,000 per household.&#13;
72.  The housing reconstruction/rehabilitation assistance package in Tigray ranges from&#13;
Birr 3,000 for homes that sustained minor damages, Birr 7,000 for homes that were&#13;
heavily destroyed and Birr 15,000 for homes that require reconstruction because they&#13;
were completely destroyed. The housing needs in Afar do not require reconstruction&#13;
-20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1A: Household Rehabilitation&#13;
activities. As the beneficiaries are largely pastoralist, they will be provided with&#13;
traditional mobile houses which are estimated to cost Birr 500 per unit. All of these&#13;
beneficiary households in both Tigray and Afar will also receive assistance in getting&#13;
basic household items such as dining utensils, sleeping materials and water containers.&#13;
This package costing around Birr 600-800 would be provided to each household that had&#13;
its home destroyed or damaged.&#13;

Benefit Package 1:    Agriculture Rehabilitation Assistance Package for Farming&#13;
Households in the Tigray Region&#13;
73. The war-affected areas in the Tigray region are within the central, eastem and&#13;
western administrative zones of the region. As in the rest of Tigray, more than 85 percent&#13;
of the population are rural, all of whom depend on mixed farming for their livelihood.&#13;
Mixed farming comprises crop-livestock production, where livestock provides traction&#13;
power, manure, food (milk and meat) and cash income while cropping is the source of&#13;
feed for livestock, food for the family and a limited source of cash income through output&#13;
sale. Thus, the ownership of traction oxen and milking cows is an important survival&#13;
mechanism for subsistence households of the Tigray region. Depending on the agro-&#13;
ecological zone, small ruminants (sheep and goats) and apiculture (bee keeping) play a&#13;
vital role as income sources and security for farm households. The average farm area in&#13;
Tigray is 1.2 ha which is small. Most farmers depend on manure application, terracing&#13;
and crop residues to maintain soil fertility. Inorganic fertilizers are applied to only about&#13;
one-third of the crop area in the region with application concentrated in the wetter parts.&#13;
Pesticide application is not common to the region. Eligible beneficiaries are: (i) an&#13;
6 Only those people who owned houses in the war-affected areas in Tigray and Afar and had these&#13;
destroyed or damaged as a result of the war will be eligible for assistance on housing reconstruction or&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
-21-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix IA. Household Rehabilitation&#13;
estimated 62,000 war-affected IDP farm households in the Tigray region; and (ii) a yet-&#13;
to-be-determined number of farm households who lost their primary bread winner.&#13;
74.  Agriculture Rehabilitation Assistance: A typical rehabilitation assistance package is&#13;
set out below. Actual allocations will depend on the "gap" between assets that individual&#13;
households currently have and what they need to establish their farming activities. The&#13;
following is an indicative package, actual items will depend on household choice.&#13;
*  all rural farm households to purchase an ox, plough set7, hand tools8 and seeds9. In&#13;
addition, the household would utilize the cash to purchase either a heifer or small&#13;
ruminants and a beehive; and&#13;
*  about 40 percent of the households to purchase inorganic fertilizer consisting of 100&#13;
kg of a mixture of DAP and Urea.&#13;
75.  It is expected that the purchase of small stock (e.g., sheep and goats, as well as&#13;
bees) will particularly benefit women farmers, as there has probably been an increase in&#13;
the number of female headed households during and after the conflict.&#13;
Benefit Package 2:    Housing Reconstruction/Rehabilitation Assistance for&#13;
Farming and Urban Households in the Tigray Region&#13;
76. Housing Reconstruction/Rehabilitation Assistance: The overall objective of this&#13;
sub-component is to provide the war-affected rural farm and urban (non-farm) IDPs (this&#13;
could also include households that lost their primary bread winner) with a minimum&#13;
affordable housing unit through reconstruction and rehabilitation of houses that were&#13;
destroyed or damaged during the war. The activities in this sub-component would&#13;
include: (a) reconstruction of housing units that are completely destroyed; (b) major&#13;
rehabilitation for those housing units that were heavily damaged; and (c) minor&#13;
rehabilitation. Cash grants will be provided to eligible beneficiaries based upon the level&#13;
of damage to each house.&#13;
77.  The Tigray Regional Government has proposed a shift from the traditional earth&#13;
packed masonry houses to a new type of housing which would involve corrugated iron&#13;
sheet roof covering. The major reason for this shift is the constraint in getting the thick&#13;
wooden beams that are used to support the earth roof given that the big trees from which&#13;
these beams were made are not readily available in the region anymore. However&#13;
communities will be given the option of using their preference in material selection.&#13;
78. Household Items Assistance: In addition to the assistance provided for household&#13;
reconstruction, assistance will also be provided for basic household items such as dining&#13;
utensils, sleeping materials and water containers. Some displaced households would&#13;
typically have received these items in the form of non-food relief but it is expected that&#13;
7 Plough set includes maresha, wogel, yoke, degger, mofer and strings.&#13;
8 Farm hand tools include a hoe, axe, a sickle, slasher and spade.&#13;
9 The estimated teff seed is sufficient for 0.5 ha of land, while sorghum and barley for 0.25 ha of land each.&#13;
The household choice would mainly be based on the agro-ecological location, individual preferences and&#13;
previous experience.&#13;
-22-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix JA: Household Rehabilitation&#13;
given the long period of usage (up to two years) most of these items would have been&#13;
extensively utilized and degraded.&#13;
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
79. A Program Management Unit will be established at the regional level in Tigray&#13;
which will be responsible for overall Program management and monitoring and will be&#13;
accountable to the President of the Regional Council. At least one staff member of the&#13;
Tigray Region PMU would be located in each of the three affected zones in order to be&#13;
able to closely monitor implementation.&#13;
80. For the Tigray Region, while the regional PMU would oversee and co-ordinate the&#13;
implementation of the Household Rehabilitation sub-component, actual implementation&#13;
would occur at the community and household level to ensure that benefits are targeted to&#13;
the needs of qualified beneficiaries and that the beneficiaries use cash advances as&#13;
agreed. Consequently, there is need for implementation support to be provided at the&#13;
local government levels closer to the households. It will, hence, be necessary that each of&#13;
the seven participating woredas in the Tigray Region use the Rehabilitation Task Force at&#13;
the woreda level (that has already been set up in the region to deal with the post-conflict&#13;
emergency) comprising the woreda chairman, woreda staff of the relevant regional&#13;
bureaus (such as agriculture, works and urban development, and labor and social affairs),&#13;
and women and youth associations. Also, each woreda would need to establish an ERP&#13;
Unit by appointing/hiring a woreda program coordinator, at least two field teams that&#13;
would provide training and back-up support to the tabia baitos (i.e., tabia councils), and&#13;
an accountant to supervise disbursements and keep financial records. Local NGOs may&#13;
be employed to undertake some or all of the responsibilities of the woreda project unit.&#13;
Operational costs including salaries, allowances, office administration and transportation&#13;
could be financed by the Project.&#13;
81. At the tabia-level, the Rehabilitation Task Force (which has also been established)&#13;
consists of the chairman of the tabia baito, the Development Agent, representatives of&#13;
women and youth associations, and community representatives from the kushet. The&#13;
tabia baitos would be the main local govermment entity providing support to the&#13;
communities in formulating their benefit packages and following up to confirrn that the&#13;
agreed productive goods are in fact purchased by each household. Independent&#13;
monitoring will be conducted to check that Program funds reach qualified beneficiaries&#13;
and that cash advances are used for the agreed purposes.&#13;
82. IDA and the Government would agree on an indicative total allocation for the&#13;
Tigray region for the first year of the Program for income generation support and housing&#13;
reconstruction. The allocation for income generation support would be computed per&#13;
woreda based on: (i) the affected number of eligible beneficiaries that can return to their&#13;
homes and start farming; (ii) the average per capita allocation for eligible beneficiaries&#13;
subject to caps for housing reconstruction and income generation support; and (iii) IDA's&#13;
financing percentage for the household rehabilitation sub-component (50 percent). The&#13;
allocation for housing would be based on agreed unit costs and an estimate of the number&#13;
of houses in each tabia that require minor, major and complete reconstruction.&#13;
-23-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix IA: Household Rehabilitation&#13;
83. Once the woreda allocations are established, the allocation amounts would be made&#13;
available to the woreda RTF. For those woredas, where the beneficiary household data is&#13;
available at the tabia level'0 the woreda would be expected to specify tabia allocations on&#13;
the basis of the same formula described in the previous paragraph. For those woredas&#13;
where such data is not available by tabia, alternative methods of identifying approximate&#13;
affected beneficiary households would be utilized. Thereafter, each tabia baito would&#13;
work with each community in its jurisdiction to allocate resources between the eligible&#13;
households, trying to fill the gap between what people have and the minimum necessary&#13;
to restart their farms and businesses, and to reconstruct and refurbish their homes for&#13;
occupancy. Each tabia baito would fill out a table for each community listing the eligible&#13;
households and the productive goods and housing reconstruction work that each agrees to&#13;
purchase with its cash advance. When the tabia baito and community are satisfied that&#13;
their resource allocation has been divided fairly, tabias would submit their proposals for&#13;
approval to the woreda administration for approval and forwarding to the Regional&#13;
Finance Bureau for transfer of funds to the woreda for disbursement by the tabia baito.&#13;
84.  Based upon an aggregated list of agreed beneficiaries for each woreda, and the total&#13;
funds required, the woreda RTF would request the regional Bureau of Finance, which&#13;
would be responsible for managing and administering a regional project account, to&#13;
transfer the required funds for each woreda to a woreda project account at the zone. The&#13;
woreda accountant would then collect the money from the zone and disburse it to the&#13;
respective tabia baitos. The tabia baito would then distribute the funds to the affected&#13;
households that were deemed eligible to receive the rehabilitation assistance packages.&#13;
85. The tabia RTF, along with the tabia baito, would subsequently be responsible for:&#13;
(a) monitoring and verification of the use of the allocated funds to the beneficiary&#13;
households; and (b) submitting an implementation report identifying remaining needs to&#13;
reconstruct housing and re-establish farming and business activities.&#13;
86.  Individual sectoral departments/bureaus at the woreda, zonal and regional levels&#13;
will provide support as needed. For example, for housing reconstruction, the Bureau of&#13;
Works and Urban Development may provide technical assistance (e.g. standard designs,&#13;
standard BOQs (Bill of Quantities) based on level of housing destruction and standard&#13;
unit cost breakdowns). Similarly, where households indicate need for fertilizer supply,&#13;
the Bureau of Agriculture would assist in facilitating fertilizer supply and distribution or&#13;
procuring from private fertilizer distributors to deliver the required quantities to each&#13;
woreda.&#13;
Accounting, Audit, and Reporting Arrangements and the Flow of Funds&#13;
87.  One project account, at the regional level, and seven other woreda project accounts&#13;
(for the seven war-affected woredas) at the zonal level will be opened (if no bank&#13;
facilities exist in the woredas). The regional Bureau of Finance and the woreda office of&#13;
finance will be responsible for the administration and accounting of the regional project&#13;
account and woreda project accounts at the woredas respectively. The woreda project&#13;
accounts at the zonal level will be used to pay each community, through the tabia baito,&#13;
as per the verified and approved comrnmunity project proposal according to an agreed&#13;
' On average, each woreda has around 20 tabias.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix JA: Household Rehabilitation&#13;
schedule. Appropriate manuals will be prepared to explain the technical, procurement and&#13;
financial flow procedures to woreda officials and community members. Capacity&#13;
enhancement through training, hiring of experienced staff and provision of equipment&#13;
and vehicles will be made based on the result of capacity assessment of the Bureau of&#13;
Finance.&#13;
88. In terrns of the flow of funds, once the approval of the woreda council is obtained,&#13;
the regional department of finance would make the funds available to the woreda&#13;
accountants for distribution to implement agreed upon activities. The woreda accountants&#13;
would distribute these funds to the tabia baitos which would then distribute the funds to&#13;
the beneficiary farm households.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
89.   The following would apply:&#13;
* Individual beneficiary households would purchase their agreed agriculture&#13;
rehabilitation package, typically an ox, farm hand tools, plough set, seeds, and either&#13;
a heifer or small ruminants and beehives.&#13;
* Individual beneficiary households would also purchase all housing construction&#13;
items. In terms of facilitating the supply of materials, the regional Bureau of Works&#13;
and Urban Development will have the responsibility of ensuring the adequacy of&#13;
supply in order to minimize the effect on the market. For the key materials (roofing&#13;
sheets, eucalyptus poles) that are required in a large quantity, the regional PMU will:&#13;
(i) contact local producers/workshops to ensure that the materials are produced&#13;
sufficiently and of the required quality and are made available to the beneficiaries;&#13;
and (ii) transport and stock of materials closer to the beneficiaries will also be&#13;
considered where needed.&#13;
* As household items are not locally available in adequate quantities, they may need to&#13;
be bought by the Regional Administration and distributed according to individual&#13;
household needs.&#13;
* One experienced procurement person would be hired to work in the PMU in the&#13;
region as an anchor for following the market, facilitating the flow of goods, carrying&#13;
out procurement activities, supervising, and assisting others when needed.&#13;
90. Supply Response: To reduce the pressure on the market at a critical time, the&#13;
Project would:&#13;
* Encourage farmers to buy the needed livestock from outside the war-affected areas by&#13;
paying for the transportation and travel costs. These costs are included in the&#13;
implementation costs on the basis of an assumption that 30 percent of the needed&#13;
draft oxen and heifers and 50 percent of needed sheep and goats will be purchased&#13;
from outside the region. In this case, the community-level networks can be very&#13;
useful by forming groups for oxen purchases.&#13;
-25-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1A: Household Rehabilitation&#13;
* Due to shortage of wood in the region, the wooden parts of the plow need to be&#13;
imported from other regions (Oromia and Amhara). The supply of wood is usually&#13;
controlled by private traders and stocks are limited. The Regional Governnent would&#13;
need to disseminate market information of the demand for such parts to traders ahead&#13;
of time to enable them to stock the required quantities.&#13;
Benefit Package 3:   Agriculture Rehabilitation Assistance for Pastoralist and&#13;
Farming Households in the Afar Region&#13;
91. In the Afar region, 34,000 people were displaced from their areas of origin, of&#13;
which 28,500 are rural. Of the displaced rural people, 1,500 people are farmers who are&#13;
engaged in irrigated crop production and 27,000 are pastoralists. The displaced people are&#13;
scattered in Elidar, Dalol, Berhale, Afder, Areft and Logia. Therefore, the total number of&#13;
displaced rural households is about 7,000 households of which the number of pastoral&#13;
households is about 6,700 and the number of farming households is about 300. The urban&#13;
displaced households number about 1,300. All of these IDP households (excluding the&#13;
urban IDP households) would be eligible to receive the agriculture rehabilitation&#13;
assistance package. Other than the IDPs mentioned above, rural farm households who&#13;
lost their primary bread winner due to the conflict would also be included in the&#13;
agriculture rehabilitation assistance that will be provided; this number is yet to be&#13;
determined.&#13;
92. Agriculture Rehabilitation Assistance for Pastoralists: Pastoralists in Afar depend&#13;
on keeping a large herd of livestock for their livelihood. According to estimates&#13;
calculated from the animal population in the region, the average herd per household is&#13;
composed of about 10 cattle, 6 sheep, 10 goats and 4 camels. This herd is the sustainable&#13;
means for food (milk and meat) and cash income from sale. The following is a typical&#13;
rehabilitation assistance package which is indicative, actual items will depend on&#13;
household choice. With the rehabilitation assistance package beneficiary households&#13;
could buy a camel, 2 heifers, and 5 sheep or goats. Actual allocations will depend on the&#13;
"gap" between assets that individual households currently have and what they need to&#13;
establish their activities.&#13;
93. Agriculture Rehabilitation Assistance for Farmers: A typical rehabilitation&#13;
assistance package for farmers is set out below. Actual allocations will depend on the&#13;
"gap" between assets that individual households currently have and what they need to&#13;
establish their farning activities. The following is an indicative package, actual items will&#13;
depend on household choice. The quantities of agricultural inputs, particularly seeds and&#13;
fertilizer that will be provided as part of this package are for three hectares of land (which&#13;
is the average farm size in the Afar region). Pesticides are not included in the package.&#13;
With this rehabilitation assistance package, the beneficiary households could purchase&#13;
the following:&#13;
* An ox, a heifer, 3 sheep or goats, hand tools, plowing set, seeds and fertilizer.&#13;
* Farm hand tools include a hoe, axe, a sickle, slasher and spade.&#13;
* 20 kg of Sorghum (for 2 ha) and 10 kg of millet (for 1 ha) seed will be provided.&#13;
-26-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1A: Household Rehabilitation&#13;
* 100 kg and 50 kg per hectare of Urea and DAP since the farmers are involved in&#13;
irrigated farming.&#13;
Benefit Package 4: Housing Reconstruction/Rehabilitation Assistance for&#13;
Pastoralist, Farming and Urban Households in Afar Region&#13;
94. Housing Reconstruction/Rehabilitation Assistance The housing needs in Afar do&#13;
not require reconstruction activities. As the beneficiaries are largely pastoralist, they will&#13;
be provided with traditional mobile houses which are estimated to cost Birr 500 per unit.&#13;
95. Household Items Assistance: In addition to the assistance provided for household&#13;
rehabilitation, assistance will also be provided for basic household items such as dining&#13;
utensils, sleeping materials and water containers. Some displaced households would&#13;
typically have received these items in the form of non-food relief but it is expected that&#13;
given the long period of usage (up to two years) most of these items would have been&#13;
extensively utilized and degraded.&#13;
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
96. Given the limited capacity of the local authorities in the Afar region to implement&#13;
this activity, the implementation responsibilities will be undertaken by the ESRDF&#13;
Regional Office which has implemented similar rehabilitation programs. Current&#13;
personnel will be supplemented with fixed term contract staff to ensure adequate capacity&#13;
in accounting, procurement, engineering and community participation to implement the&#13;
component. The existing mechanism for the flow of funds under the ESRDF will be used.&#13;
97. For each affected pastoral community, a committee (could be clan elders) will be&#13;
selected by the community in the presence of an ESRDF representative. The committee,&#13;
along with ESRDF staff, will assist each community to allocate resources between&#13;
eligible beneficiary households as described above for the household component in&#13;
Tigray Region. Once the Regional Rehabilitation Task Force has approved the&#13;
community beneficiary assessments, the ESRDF Regional Office will distribute the funds&#13;
to the agreed beneficiaries. The community committee will also work closely with the&#13;
ESRDF representative and livestock specialists in the Bureau of Agriculture to facilitate&#13;
the supply of livestock in the markets for the beneficiaries to purchase. If the livestock&#13;
are not locally available in adequate quantities, the ESRDF Regional Office may assist by&#13;
paying transport fees for the beneficiaries to purchase livestock outside the region, or take&#13;
other appropriate measures.&#13;
98. Individual departments/bureaus at the woreda, zonal and regional levels will&#13;
provide support as needed. For example, the Bureau of Agriculture will monitor the&#13;
agriculture rehabilitation assistance package part of the rehabilitation Prograrn in Afar.&#13;
This Bureau could also consult with suppliers to facilitate the delivery of improved&#13;
sorghum and pearl millet and fertilizer to the communities of the beneficiaries.&#13;
-27-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix JA: Household Rehabilitation&#13;
99.  With respect to rehabilitation of housing, besides the ESRDF Regional Office&#13;
which is the implementing agency, the regional DPPB will also be responsible for&#13;
assessment, verification and subsequent approval of the replacement of the mobile&#13;
houses.&#13;
Institutional Capacity Assessment&#13;
100. The existing ESDRF capacity will be used in implementing the Program in close&#13;
consultation with the Regional Government and beneficiaries. The institutional capacity&#13;
of the ESRDF Regional Office to implement the Program is assessed to be adequate if&#13;
additional contract staff are engaged.&#13;
Accounting, Audit, and Reporting Arrangements and the Flow of Funds&#13;
101. The financing for this activity would be obtained from reprogramming resources&#13;
from the ESRDF project. The ESRDF Regional Office will be responsible for the&#13;
management of the Project Account to be opened at the regional level. However, the&#13;
regional DPPB will assign one financial staff who will help in distribution of funds to the&#13;
beneficairies and documenting receipts for the reconciliation.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
102. Regarding fertilizer supply, the Regional Bureau of Agriculture would consult with&#13;
suppliers to facilitate the delivery of fertilizer in the required quantities to each affected&#13;
woreda. The relevant woreda agriculture offices would arrange storage facilities for the&#13;
fertilizer. The delivery of fertilizer from woreda centers to kebele levels would be&#13;
handled by the community and individual farmers. Similar arrangements will be used for&#13;
delivery of improved seeds.&#13;
103. For the housing activity, the ESRDF Regional Office will facilitate the distribution&#13;
of the mobile housing units to the beneficiaries along with the DPPB. The elements of the&#13;
mobile housing units will be purchased and assembled by the individual beneficiaries.&#13;
The woreda level administrative structure will also assist in this process.&#13;
Social and Environmental Impact&#13;
104. It is expected that the agriculture rehabilitation assistance package and housing&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation in both the Tigray and Afar Regions will have no&#13;
appreciable environmental impact overall. The restocking rate of livestock envisaged will&#13;
be small compared to the pre-war level. The application of inorganic fertilizer would be&#13;
limited. Pesticides will not be included in the rehabilitation package and therefore, since&#13;
its use is not anticipated there will be no adverse environmental impacts in that respect. In&#13;
the Tigray Region, however, the possible impact on the environment due to the potential&#13;
use of wood to provide wooden beams as construction material would need to be&#13;
analyzed carefully. This will be confirmed through a social and environmental&#13;
assessment to be conducted in the first six months of the Project.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1A: Household Rehabilitation&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
105. The objectives of the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) are to: (i) evaluate the&#13;
progress in resettling the planned number of households in the areas from which they&#13;
were displaced; (ii) assess the flow of cash to the households in an efficient and timely&#13;
manner; (iii) assess the supply bottlenecks and the functioning of input markets; (iv)&#13;
assess institutional and market constraints that may affect the efficiency of the activities;&#13;
(v) ensure use of funds for the intended purposes by the households; and (vi) provide&#13;
feedback to the regional government and Federal government. The monitoring and&#13;
evaluation will be based on well structured, random, community, household, and market&#13;
surveys in all locations of the war-affected people on a regular basis (3-6 months&#13;
depending on the schedule of the implementation in each area). The information collected&#13;
would then be compiled and recommendations made to resolve constraints and to assure&#13;
smooth implementation of Project activities under this sub-component.&#13;
Implementation Risks&#13;
106. In the Tigray Region, with respect to the agriculture rehabilitation assistance&#13;
package, actions would need to be taken to carefully monitor the functioning of the input&#13;
market to ensure the delivery of quality inputs, at the right time at a suitable price. This is&#13;
especially critical given the large nature of the Project, the short time for the&#13;
implementation and the flow of funds to the affected households. The markets involved&#13;
include the livestock market supplying oxen, heifers, goats and sheep, the seed market&#13;
supplying teff, barley and sorghum seed, the fertilizer market, and the farm implements&#13;
market. Risks of failure of the input markets may arise from: (a) unavailability of inputs&#13;
in the local markets at the beginning of the cropping season leading to loss of cropping&#13;
season or delays in planting time; (b) high prices of inputs as a result of increased&#13;
demand for inputs. In this case, farmers will not be able to buy the specified quantity of&#13;
inputs. Given the above, a contingency plan, satisfactory to IDA, to deal with any&#13;
bottlenecks in the supply of inputs would need to be developed by the Government.&#13;
107. In the Afar Region, since the number of beneficiaries is relatively small, pressure&#13;
on the market is unlikely.&#13;
Action Plan&#13;
108. The implementation plan for both regions will need to be phased based on three&#13;
considerations: (i) Implementation should only commence in areas which are declared&#13;
free of mines. Data in this regard will become available as the de-mining survey is&#13;
completed. However, it is assumed that substantial portions of the areas from which&#13;
people were moved to avoid artillery fire are free of mines and activities could commence&#13;
immediately in those areas; (ii) People would need to be able to move back into their&#13;
houses in order to engage in their main economic activities. Consequently, those areas&#13;
where there was only minimal damage to homes would be primary areas for the first&#13;
phase of returnees; (iii) The determination of benefits packages and the release of funds&#13;
to households needs to be completed in time to allow households to purchase assets and&#13;
inputs prior to the next planting season i.e., in May-June. An action plan based on the&#13;
above considerations should be developed by November 30, 2000 by the Government.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix IA. Household Rehabilitation&#13;
Benefit Package 5:   Income Generation Assistance for Urban Beneficiaries&#13;
throughout the Country&#13;
109. The objective is to support identified households with the assets and inputs which&#13;
will assist them in undertaking income generating activities. The target household group&#13;
includes non-farm (urban) IDPs (about 22,200 households), deportees/returnees (about&#13;
38,000 households to date and another 16,500 expected in the next few months,&#13;
principally in Tigray and Amhara regions), and households with deceased bread winners&#13;
who do not own farms, and, hence, are unable to benefit from the agricultural package of&#13;
support which has been described earlier. The target household group will be largely in&#13;
the Tigray region (non-farm urban households; deportee/returnee households and&#13;
households of deceased bread winners). In addition, significant concentrations of&#13;
deportee households have been identified in Amhara, Oromia, Addis Ababa and Dire&#13;
Dawa.&#13;
110. Income Generation Assistance: Eligible households would be entitled to use the&#13;
benefits package for two purposes:&#13;
* for households which were previously engaged in income generating activities,&#13;
replacement of fixed assets and acquisition of inputs which are required for the first&#13;
cycle of production or for households engaging in new income generating projects&#13;
(especially deportees), acquisition of new assets and inputs;&#13;
* undertaking training which will improve their ability to undertake or participate in&#13;
income generating activities.&#13;
111. The rehabilitation assistance packages for deportees/returnees and families of the&#13;
deceased would be determined based on the following considerations:&#13;
(a) In the event that some of the households of the deceased own land on which&#13;
they would like to farm, then they will receive an equivalent of the agricultural&#13;
rehabilitation package (i.e., that specified for the Tigray and Afar Regions as&#13;
applicable).&#13;
(b) If the deported/returned households and families of deceased do not own land&#13;
but would still prefer to be engaged in rural activities, then they would qualify for&#13;
income generation and support to undertake rural-related activities.&#13;
(c) Those deported/returned households that would prefer to settle in urban areas&#13;
and those families of deceased that already reside in urban areas would be eligible&#13;
to receive income generation and support for non-farm activities in urban areas.&#13;
112. Further, to the extent that communities are submitting proposals for income&#13;
generating activities, the following additional considerations will apply:&#13;
* Group formation: Income generating activities are carried out both at the household&#13;
level but more often by groups of households. Eligible households will be allowed to&#13;
"pool" together the grant eligibility and thereby attain a higher limit for purchase of&#13;
assets/inputs for group activities.&#13;
-30-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix JA: Household Rehabilitation&#13;
* Preparation of proposals for income generating activities/projects and implementation&#13;
support: There are several variables that impact on project viability including demand&#13;
for the products, competition from alternative suppliers, costs of production, quality&#13;
of the products etc. In preparing projects, the impact of many variables needs to be&#13;
projected. Income generating projects, especially those being undertaken by a newly&#13;
formed group, require a high degree of implementation support in the initial phases.&#13;
Special consideration will need to be given to the provision of support to income&#13;
generating activities either from the relevant regional Bureaus (e.g. the Bureau of&#13;
Trade and Industry) or from relevant NGOs (e.g. REST in Tigray).&#13;
* Further, where the household/group of households identify that part of the&#13;
Government's grant should be utilized for purposes of training, the household/group&#13;
would be entitled to take the training at an eligible training institution.&#13;
113. The Governmnent would identify one or more eligible NGO in the concerned&#13;
regions; this would be primarily in Tigray and Afar but would need to include some other&#13;
regions (Amhara and Oromia) as well some large cities (Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa)&#13;
where the majority of the deportees are present. The Government would identify an&#13;
appropriate administrative fee to be paid to NGOs which assist communities in the&#13;
formulation of income generation proposals. Similarly, the Govermnent will identify&#13;
eligible training institutions which can participate in the provision of training activities&#13;
under this component.&#13;
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
114. For qualified beneficiaries In Tigray and Afar, the process described for the&#13;
agriculture rehabilitation assistance package will apply.&#13;
115. For affected households in other regions, the Regional Administrations of those&#13;
regions to where the deported/returned population have returned (apart from Tigray and&#13;
Afar) and where the families of the deceased reside will be responsible for implementing&#13;
the household rehabilitation packages that these people may be eligible for. The main&#13;
regions, in this instance, are Amhara and Oromia, and the city administrations of Addis&#13;
Ababa and Dire Dawa.&#13;
116. A Regional Project Management Unit would need to be established in the regions&#13;
as required to implement this component. The PMU could be located in the relevant&#13;
regional sectoral bureaus and may involve zonal and woreda finance offices depending&#13;
upon the local government level at which the majority of beneficiaries reside. The PMU&#13;
would report to the President of the Regional Council and through him to the Federal&#13;
Emergency Recovery Program Management Unit in MEDaC. The Regional PMU would&#13;
be responsible for identifying affected beneficiaries in the woredas and making&#13;
appropriate allocations to the woreda level. In general, the relevant beneficiaries&#13;
(deportees/returnees or households of deceased bread winners) would be required to form&#13;
community groups and identify persons who take the lead in putting together proposals.&#13;
The proposals would be reviewed and approved by the Regional PMU in conjunction&#13;
with the relevant woreda.&#13;
-31-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix JA: Household Rehabilitation&#13;
117. The regional Bureau of Finance will disburse the agreed funds to the beneficiary&#13;
communities based on the approved project proposals. The involvement of zonal and&#13;
woreda finance offices will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending upon the&#13;
level at which the majority of beneficiaries are residing.&#13;
118. Persons from the Regional PMU would make follow-up visits to confirm that&#13;
beneficiaries have used the funds for the agreed purpose. They would then make this&#13;
information available to Regional Government authorities and the ERPMU.&#13;
Start-up Action Plan for Household Rehabilitation&#13;
For Tigray:&#13;
*  Finalize organization, management/staffing of PMU including decision on decision to report to  Nov30&#13;

Afar estimating the number of IDPs in each and the initial budget for rehabilitation grants for&#13;
each.&#13;
*  ESRDF Regional Offices to prepare a listing of community infrastructure in the war affected  Nov30&#13;
area to be rehabilitated including 1) identification of all community infrastructure to be financed  Dec31&#13;
by all donors in the war affected area including a description of the works, cost and location,&#13;
and 2) preparation and packaging of contract documents for community infrastructure including&#13;
schools, clinics, and water.&#13;
*  Prepare an operational manual for PMU and ESRDF office in Tigray and ESRDF office in Afar    Ops manual&#13;

Appendix 1B: Community Infrastructure Rehabilitation&#13;
APPENDIX 1B: REHABILITATION OF COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
119. The major objective of this sub-component is to rehabilitate, reconstruct, equip and&#13;
furnish the damaged or destroyed social infrastructure at the community level and restore&#13;
the resumption of delivery of basic services. Infrastructure rehabilitation will be&#13;
complemented by a set of activities to assist internally displaced people to rebuild their&#13;
livelihoods. The rehabilitation of IDPs through provision of essential farming inputs and&#13;
support to reconstruct their houses will enable them to begin farming and other activities&#13;
again. It is hoped that with these packages the pre-conflict situation would be restored&#13;
and effective delivery of services would be possible.&#13;
120. Description of Activities: This sub-component specifically addresses the restoration&#13;
of basic infrastructure at the community level in the education, health, and water supply&#13;
sectors and also of animal health facilities. To date the following have been identified: (i)&#13;
rehabilitation and reconstruction of 80 schools, 26 health facilities, 5 veterinary clinics,&#13;
26 animal health posts, 127 medium and deep water wells, 15 springs and I warehouse;&#13;
(ii) furniture and equipment; and (iii) replacement of 130 kms of water supply pipeline&#13;
and a water tanker. The funds for these activities will come from reprogrammed&#13;
resources from the ESRDF project. The total cost of this sub-component is estimated to&#13;

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
121. In the Tigray Region, beneficiary communities and the woreda and tabia level&#13;
administration will participate during the whole process of planning and implementation.&#13;
Specifically, the responsibility for implementing this sub-component would be with the&#13;
ESRDF Regional Office. The rehabilitation and reconstruction, i.e., the civil works&#13;
contracts will be carried out by private contractors, with supervision by staff from the&#13;
education, health, water supply and agriculture bureaus and by the Bureau of Works and&#13;
Urban Development. At the provisional and final acceptance stages, a joint review and&#13;
certification with the Bureau of Works and Urban Development would be needed, while&#13;
for other (interim) payments supervision by the sector bureau would suffice. The ESRDF&#13;
Regional Office would also responsible for procuring furniture, equipment, and medical&#13;
and educational supplies.&#13;
122. In the Afar Region, this activity would also be implemented by the ESRDF&#13;
Regional Office.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix IB: Community Infrastructure Rehabilitation&#13;
Institutional Capacity Assessment&#13;
123. Both the ESRDF Regional Offices in Tigray and Afar have adequate capacity and&#13;
expertise in implementing similar rehabilitation programs. However, the office in Tigray&#13;
may have to be strengthened with the engagement of some additional staff.&#13;
Accounting, Audit, and Reporting Arrangements and the Flow of Funds&#13;
124. In both Tigray and Afar, a separate project account will need to be set up in the&#13;
ESRDF Regional Office for the purposes of this sub-component. The ESRDF Regional&#13;
Office will be responsible for administering and managing this account.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
125. As this sub-component will be financed through the ESRDF project, it will follow&#13;
the procurement procedures already identified in that project. Procurement under this&#13;
sub-component needs to be simple, efficient and transparent. The procurement method&#13;
for works (for the reconstruction of completely damaged facilities) will be NCB and&#13;
quotations will be used for rehabilitation work (for repairing partial damages). Mostly&#13;
NCB and shopping will be used for the procurement of furniture, textbooks, and&#13;
equipment. A procurement plan will be prepared for this sub-component.&#13;
Social and Environmental Impact&#13;
126. The activities under this sub-component simply involve the rehabilitation of&#13;
existing facilities that were damaged or destroyed. Therefore, no adverse environmental&#13;
impacts are envisaged.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
127. Relevant monitoring indicators with regard to the status and progress on the&#13;
implementation of agreed procurement plans and other work programs would include:&#13;
tasks related to rehabilitation and reconstruction of facilities, procurement of furniture,&#13;
equipment, medical supplies, textbooks, etc.; proportion of procurement activities&#13;
delayed, and completed as planned; level of disbursements as compared to the plan,&#13;
efficiency in the use of the project account facilities (e.g., the frequency and quality of&#13;
replenishment applications); indicators for the effectiveness of project management-&#13;
outcomes of meetings, and follow-up actions, etc. In addition, a set of indicators would&#13;
be identified for performance monitoring: access/coverage of services and quality of&#13;
services in the base and target year, e.g., the number of classrooms /student places,&#13;
enrolment, pupil:section and pupil:teacher ratio, text book:pupil ratio, etc.&#13;
Action Plan&#13;
128. All actions needed to quickly start the implementation process, e.g., detailed&#13;
assessment or verification of the extent of damages of the facilities to be rehabilitated and&#13;
preparation of the bill of quantities and costing and sequencing of activities have to be&#13;
undertaken. The ESRDF Regional Offices need to assess the capacities of their own&#13;
technical staff or consider the use of local consultants to carry out these investigations&#13;
(including condition survey/inspection, design and contract documentation). Further&#13;
breakdown of the values of the components: civil works (repairs and new construction),&#13;
furniture, equipment, textbooks, medical supplies, and services would also be needed.&#13;

Appendix 2: HI VIAIDS Prevention, Care and Support&#13;
APPENDIX 2: HIV/AIDS PREVENTION, CARE AND SUPPORT&#13;
129. The main objective of the HIV/AIDS component is to reduce HIV infection and&#13;
spread by scaling-up HIV/AIDS related interventions for the army and the displaced&#13;
population as a result of the conflict. HIV/AIDS interventions in the conflict areas will&#13;
involve prevention, care and support. The extent to which the various intervention&#13;
measures are applied would depend on the type and nature of the target group. The target&#13;
groups for HIV/AIDS intervention under the ERP include people displaced as a result of&#13;
the conflict, deportees/returnees, Commercial Sex Workers (CSWs), the military and host&#13;
communities.&#13;
130. The HIV/AIDS component will include the following four activities:&#13;
(i) Strengthening services for the displaced persons at the local level: According to the&#13;
figures given by the government a total of about 68,745 rural and approximately 22,230&#13;
urban households have been displaced in Tigray and Afar. Some have already returned&#13;
and most of the displaced from rural areas are expected to return to their villages or to the&#13;
vicinity over the next year to 18 months depending upon mine clearance progress in those&#13;
areas. About 38,000 households have been deported and 16,500 households are expected&#13;
in the next few months. All of these households are expected to be resettled mostly in&#13;
urban areas. The majority of the displaced will remain for some months in temporary&#13;
centers requiring a special arrangement for the provision of HIV/AIDS preventive, care&#13;
and support services.&#13;
(ii) Provision of services to the military, demobilized soldiers and CSWs: The military is&#13;
a special risk group whose sexual behavior would affect the community and vice-versa.&#13;
IEC, provision of condoms, voluntary counseling and testing and easy access to the&#13;
treatment of STDs and opportunistic infections are important intervention measures. It is&#13;
reported that the number of commercial sex workers have increased with the increasing&#13;
number of soldiers. These CSW are mostly concentrated in market towns in the vicinity&#13;
of the military camps. They become common sources for sexually transmitted infections&#13;
and HIV unless they are encouraged to demand condom use by their partners and&#13;
provided with female condoms. In addition to the peer group discussions and education,&#13;
CSWs will have easy access to male and female condoms.&#13;
(iii) Care and support to those affected and infected: Those known to be affected should&#13;
be given easy access to the treatment for opportunistic infection and extensive&#13;
community education campaigns should be launched to reduce stigmatization.&#13;
Communities need to be supported to take care of the sick and orphans and families&#13;
whose livelihood have been adversely affected by the death of the bread winner. Income&#13;
generating schemes by communities to care for those affected and infected will be&#13;
supported under this component.&#13;
(iv) Coordination and management: The regional HIV/AIDS secretariat, and the Boards&#13;
and focal units at zonal and woreda levels will be the coordinating units for this&#13;
HIV/AIDS component. The implementation of HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support is&#13;
complex when multisectoral and multiple implementers are involved. The situation&#13;
-36-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2: HI VIAIDS Prevention, Care and Support&#13;
necessitates the installment of an elaborate institutional arrangement for coordination.&#13;
Sector ministries, NGOs and the private sector need to be engaged in the implementation&#13;
of an HIV/AIDS program. The capacity of these institutions will be strengthened by&#13;
providing support to improve their skills through training and financial support in an&#13;
attempt to scale-up their activities at the community level.&#13;
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
131. This component will be financed from the Ethiopia Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS&#13;
Project and implementation modalities will follow what has been agreed under EMSAP.&#13;
The overall management and coordination of this component will be the responsibility of&#13;
the regional HIV/AIDS secretariats. The implementation of the activities under the&#13;
component will be the responsibility of the local units of sector bureaus namely health,&#13;
education, agriculture, trade, industry and transport, tourism, culture and inforrnation, the&#13;
army, local HIV/AIDS Boards, NGOs and the private sector. Specific roles and&#13;
responsibilities of the various implementers will be defined. The implementing agencies&#13;
will submit quarterly reports and statements of financial expenditures before additional&#13;
funds are released.&#13;
132.  The coordination of HIV/AIDS activities in the region is the responsibility of the&#13;
secretariat of the HIV/AIDS Regional Board which is given the status of a bureau under the&#13;
regional government. In the Tigray Region, the Board is chaired by the Social Sector Head of&#13;
the Tigray Regional Government and the Secretariat is composed of the head of the Secretariat,&#13;
Departments of Surveillance and Research, Program Development and Evaluation, IEC and&#13;
Social Services and Administration and Finance. The Secretariat has at present four technical&#13;
staff and four administrative and support staff with accounting and management diplomas.&#13;
133. The HIV/AIDS Organization and Management structure includes the Regional&#13;
Board and secretariat, Zonal and Woreda Boards and focal units. The zonal and woreda&#13;
secretariats are housed in the Zonal and Woreda health departments and offices in the&#13;
Tigray Region. It is expected that HIV/AIDS focal units and offices will be established in&#13;
the respective zones and woredas within a year to facilitate the coordination of all&#13;
HIV/AIDS activities and this could be accelerated with additional resources from this&#13;
component. HIV/AIDS boards are established at tabia/kebele levels to effectively&#13;
coordinate HIV/AIDS activities in their respective communities.&#13;
134. The military will have an organizational structure of its own to accommodate its&#13;
special needs. Generally, the military has a well established organizational structure&#13;
which would be used to scale-up HIV/AIDS interventions. HIV/AIDS focal units will be&#13;
created at the command level to coordinate HIV/AIDS activities and manage funds&#13;
including accounting, financial and Program reporting to the regional HIV/AIDS&#13;
secretariat every quarter before the next quarter tranche is released. The activities related&#13;
to CSWs will be coordinated by the focal unit of the Woreda HIV/AIDS Board in close&#13;
collaboration with woreda health and social affairs offices.&#13;
-37-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2: HI VIAIDS Prevention, Care and Support&#13;
Institutional Capacity Assessment&#13;
135. The regional secretariat and the focal points in the beneficiary zones and woredas&#13;
will be strengthened in terms of manpower and material resources to effectively&#13;
discharge their coordination responsibilities.&#13;
Accounting, Audit and Reporting Arrangements and Funds Flow&#13;
136. Generally, the financial management will be guided by the processes and&#13;
procedures established for EMSAP. The amount required for the HIV/AIDS component&#13;
(US$2.5 million) will flow from the special account of the central coordinating unit to the&#13;
regional HIV/AIDS secretariat's Bank Account every quarter based on quarterly regional&#13;
plans. Special commitment may be requested by the secretariat for payments to be made&#13;
through letters of credit for items to be procured using international shopping and/or ICB.&#13;
Each implementing agency will submit quarterly financial and Program reports and the&#13;
secretariat will consolidate all the financial reports for submission to the central&#13;
coordinating unit. With respect to the flow of funds, they flow directly to the regional&#13;
secretariat from the central account and the regional secretariat will allocate the funds&#13;
based on agreed yearly action plans. The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) prepared&#13;
for EMSAP will be used to delineate the processes and responsibilities for general&#13;
management, procurement, and financial management and control including terms of&#13;
reference for internal and external audits acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
137. As this HIV/AIDS component is financed and implemented under the EMSAP, the&#13;
procurement will follow the procedures set out and agreed under EMSAP. Much of the&#13;
procurement for the HIV/AIDS component will be through International Shopping and/or&#13;
ICB essentially following the Bank's Procurement Guidelines for all IDA-financed&#13;
activities. As much as possible, simplified procurement and disbursement procedures for&#13;
community-based investments will be used. In order to facilitate the speedy import of&#13;
items required urgently for diagnosis, treatment and institutional strengthening, items&#13;
valued at less than US$100,000 equivalent contracts may be made based on international&#13;
shopping and national shopping procedures, respectively, per IDA Procurement&#13;
Guidelines (clauses 3.5 and 3.6) or through procurement from the United Nations (i.e.,&#13;
IAPSO, UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO). Major items to be procured through international&#13;
shopping and ICB include drugs and medical supplies, diagnostic equipment and&#13;
vehicles.&#13;
Social and Environmental Impact&#13;
138. The HIV/AIDS component is expected to reduce the social impact of HIV/AIDS in&#13;
the target populations. The project is not expected to create any serious negative impact&#13;
on the environment because the activities of health institutions and service providers will&#13;
incorporate standard measures for the safe disposal of medical waste. Waste disposal&#13;
facilities such as incinerators exist in health institutions.&#13;

Appendix 3: De-mining&#13;
APPENDIX 3: SUPPORT FOR DE-MINING ACTIVITIES&#13;
140. Need for De-mining: The threat comes from three broad sources: (i) mines, (ii)&#13;
UXO, and (iii) improvised devices. Stake mines which are found in large numbers on the&#13;
Ethiopian/Eritrean border, if triggered, discharge metal fragments in a 360 degree arc,&#13;
killing anyone within 13 feet with the potential to kill/injure at a distance of about 75&#13;
feet. Other types of mines are also found in Ethiopia, e.g., the bounding mines, which are&#13;
very difficult to see as only the fuse protrudes above the soil. These mines discharge&#13;
lethal fragments up to 100 feet and can inflict severe injuries up to a distance of 300 feet.&#13;
UXO refers to any explosive munitions which has not been initiated and the range of the&#13;
term is vast, encompassing everything from a bullet to a 3,000 lb bomb. An improvised&#13;
device or booby trap is one of the most vicious devices designed to kill or injure and&#13;
which detonates unexpectedly when a person or vehicle approaches or disturbs what is&#13;
apparently a harmless object. Booby traps can be found anywhere and can look like&#13;
anything, they are designed to catch the unwary and the curious such as children. Anti&#13;
tank mines are also found in Ethiopia but the designed pressure required to initiate the&#13;
blast is around 300 pounds. However, if the fuse is corroded it can be detonated by a&#13;
human being or animal. Anti tank mines are generally "protected" by antipersonnel mines&#13;
to prevent people from trying to clear them.&#13;
141. According to various sources of information, including local NGOs and the UN,&#13;
the level of contamination by mines and UXO in the former battle area in Ethiopia is&#13;
severe. There are defensive minefields laid in depth, nuisance mines laid by both armies&#13;
as they retreated, booby traps, air dropped sub-munitions, iron bombs and the whole&#13;
range of artillery and infantry ordnance.&#13;
142. IDPs have spontaneously been going back into former battle areas despite being&#13;
advised not to return by the governnent/local authorities, to check on their houses and&#13;
collect vegetables and fruits. It is reported that personal injuries have sharply increased,&#13;
and large numbers of livestock have been killed. More than half of the victims of&#13;
landmines or UXO are reported to be children despite mine awareness efforts conducted&#13;
by a local non-government organization, the Relief and Development Organization in&#13;
cooperation with UNICEF, in the three contaminated zones in Tigray. A relatively high&#13;
degree of mine awareness exists among the population. However, although there is,&#13;
reportedly, some evidence that the behavior of certain groups around mines and UXO has&#13;
changed this is not quantifiable as no baseline survey has been conducted so far.&#13;
143. Lessons Learned from Previous De-mining Projects: Lessons learned from previous&#13;
experience with de-mining projects suggest that the Bank should: (i) have a clear plan to&#13;
ensure that rehabilitation activities are undertaken only where de-mining has been&#13;
completed; (ii) ensure that experienced quality assurance is part of mine clearing; and&#13;
(iii) given the Bank's limited expertise in de-mining, involve relevant international&#13;
organizations.&#13;
144. De-mining Efforts to Date: Small scale de-mining operations have already been&#13;
started for military purposes and to clear routes and adjacent areas of visible mines. It&#13;
should not be considered as safe for the return of the displaced persons. Many IDPs who&#13;
have returned to their farms have taken enormous risks to cultivate their land and graze&#13;
-40-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3: De-mining&#13;
their cattle. DflD has provided funding for an NGO, the Halo Trust, which is responsible&#13;
for surveying the Temporary Security Zone and adjacent areas along the border for&#13;
landmines and UXO in preparation for the deployment of the UN peacekeeping troops.&#13;
At present the Ethiopian De-mining Project together with two teams from the Halo Trust,&#13;
is undertaking this emergency landmine/UXO survey along the border area between&#13;
Ethiopia and Eritrea.The survey commenced in early October 2000 and is expected to&#13;
take three months to complete.&#13;
145. The Ethiopian De-mining Project was created in 1995 through a USAID assistance&#13;
program intended to establish a humanitarian de-mining capacity within Ethiopia capable&#13;
of responding to the threat imposed by hundreds of thousands landmines and UXO in&#13;
certain parts of the country. The proposed institutional arrangements foresaw the&#13;
development of a viable humanitarian de-mining structure, so EDP was established as a&#13;
non-combatant unit in the Ministry of Defense, distinct from the Army's Corps of&#13;
Engineers. Despite financial constraints, EDP has contributed significantly to the&#13;
reduction of the landmine/UXO threat to civilians in Ethiopia, and has demonstrated the&#13;
commitment of the Ethiopian government to address the problem. The recent conflict&#13;
between Eritrea an Ethiopia has considerably increased the need for humanitarian de-&#13;
mining in the country, and so would require EDP to expand its capacity and to improve&#13;
its capability of meeting international standards.&#13;
146. Component Objective and Description: The objective of the de-mining component&#13;
is to mitigate the threat of landmines and UXO and to create an environment conducive&#13;
for the safe and sustainable return of civilians to their homes and livelihood. The Project&#13;
will provide financial support for the actual clearance of mines and unexploded ordnance&#13;
and restoration to productive use of priority areas.&#13;
147. Specific tasks will include:&#13;
(i) establishment of a Humanitarian Mine Action quality assurance unit within the&#13;
Federal Emergency Program Management Unit in MEDaC;&#13;
(ii) provision of Humanitarian Mine Action equipment and materials;&#13;
(iii) training of personnel of the Ethiopian De-mining Project (500 persons);&#13;
(iv) landmines and battle area clearance, and disposal; and&#13;
(v) identification (level 2 survey) and marking of hazardous areas.&#13;
148. The Federal ERPMU in MEDaC would be the decision-making and oversight&#13;
authority for the de-mining component. The ERPMU would be responsible for: (a)&#13;
setting the standards for mine clearing works; (b) reviewing the standard operating&#13;
procedures and safety regulations of mine clearing agencies; (c) conducting quality&#13;
assurance tests to ensure compliance of mine clearing agencies with accepted&#13;
international standards for humanitarian mine clearance and UN guidelines; and (d)&#13;
ensuring that all mine clearing activities are carried out and all mines cleared under the&#13;
Project are promptly destroyed in accordance with appropriate safety standards and&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
-41-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3: De-mining&#13;
149. The mine clearance activities would be undertaken by the Ethiopian De-mining&#13;
Project (a non-combatant unit in the military) under contract to the ERPMU. The&#13;
ERPMU and the EDP will work together to coordinate de-mining activities in the war-&#13;
affected areas with the household rehabilitation sub-component.&#13;
150. Current quality assurance standards for de-mining set out in ISO 9000, are being&#13;
reviewed in order to be adapted to humanitarian mine action. The ERPMU will institute a&#13;
quality assurance program which will be tailored to the Humanitarian Mine Action needs&#13;
in Ethiopia in consultation with international experts.&#13;
151. This component has been prepared in consultation with EDP, UNMAS and other&#13;
United Nations Humanitarian Mine Action advisors. It is expected that the duration of de-&#13;
mining activities under the Project would be for about two years. The estimated cost of&#13;
the component is about US$30 million which IDA will finance. The Government intends&#13;
to seek grant funding from its other development partners to finance de-mining activities.&#13;
If grant funds for this purpose are secured then IDA financing for this component would&#13;
be reallocated for other project needs.&#13;
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
152. The ERPMU would supervise the implementation of de-mining and be responsible&#13;
for ensuring that the activities are carried out in accordance with international standards,&#13;
based on monitoring and verification by a quality assurance unit within the ERPMU. The&#13;
ERPMU would also be responsible for coordinating de-mining activities in the war-&#13;
affected areas with the household rehabilitation sub-component, as well as for collating&#13;
information on overall implementation progress and preparing progress reports. The&#13;
Ethiopian De-mining Project which is currently carrying out de-mining in the war-&#13;
affected areas would do mine clearance under contract to the ERPMU. The Project will&#13;
provide the necessary support to adapt the Ethiopian De-mining Project to meet the needs&#13;
of the Program including technical assistance, training and equipment through the&#13;
ERPMU.&#13;
153. The Government will actively discourage people from returning to their homes&#13;
until they are declared safe from mines and UXO and will ensure that the household&#13;
rehabilitation sub-component in the war-affected areas strictly follow an implementation&#13;
plan that allows people to return only to areas that are declared safe. The household&#13;
rehabilitation sub-component would continue only as long as de-mining done according&#13;
to international humanitarian standards, as confirmed by an independent quality control&#13;
unit, precedes resettlement of displaced persons in areas determined by the current de-&#13;
mining survey to be unsafe for civilian occupation.&#13;
Accounting, Audit and Reporting Arrangements and the Flow of Funds&#13;
154. A Special Account for de-mining operations and all foreign exchange denominated&#13;
expenditures related to rehabilitation will be opened in the Federal Emergency Recovery&#13;
Program Management Unit at MEDaC and managed by the Financial Manager. The&#13;
operation of this account will be as per Bank procedures.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3: De-mining&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
155. The procurement for this component will be done by the procurement unit at the&#13;
Federal ERPMU which will contract the EDP to undertake mine clearance activities.&#13;
There will be a very strong quality assurance process to ensure that the de-mining is&#13;
carried out according to international humanitarian de-mining standards. This quality&#13;
assurance program will be developed in consultation with international experts, and&#13;
approved by the Government and financing organizations.&#13;
Social and Environmental Impact&#13;
156. This component is expected to have a significant positive environmental impact&#13;
through its contribution to de-mining a significant area of land, a large part of which is&#13;
arable.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
157. A plan for monitoring and evaluation will be developed after the completion of the&#13;
survey being done by Halo Trust and the EDP. The information from the survey will&#13;
provide a baseline of what currently obtains on the ground.&#13;

158. The Reconstruction Component will consist of the following two sub-components:&#13;
(i) Rehabilitation/Improvement of road infrastructure; and (ii) Reconstruction/&#13;
rehabilitation of power supply infrastructure.&#13;
159. The overall objectives of the Roads Sub-component are to assist the Government of&#13;
Ethiopia to: (i) rapidly rehabilitate and restore destroyed or damaged road infrastructure&#13;
in the war-affected areas; (ii) rehabilitate critical road sections and bridges that have&#13;
suffered serious damage due to an increase in heavy unexpected traffic and/or the&#13;
diversion of traffic from the original import/export route to new routes; (iii) rehabilitate&#13;
roads to ensure operational efficiency in the implementation of relief program activities&#13;
and facilitate the flow of imported humanitarian cargo in selected chronically drought-&#13;
affected areas; and (iv) carry out emergency heavy maintenance of priority roads whose&#13;
improvement had been slowed down by the war leading to further deterioration of large&#13;
sections. The road improvements would also contribute to reducing infrastructure-related&#13;
market and distribution costs by reducing road transport costs, and create additional&#13;
employment for the war-affected populations to the extent that labor intensive methods&#13;
are utilized.&#13;
160. ERA expects to implement the Roads Sub-component within the objectives and&#13;
strategy developed and implemented for the Government's Road Sector Development&#13;
Programme (RSDP) and supported by IDA. First, the Roads sub-component provides an&#13;
opportunity for arresting further deterioration of the roads affected by the war by&#13;
removing the additional road maintenance backlog created. Second, by targeting&#13;
investment at the restoration of key road and bridge infrastructure facilities which have&#13;
further deteriorated as result of the war, it would contribute to restoring the condition of&#13;
the network and to establishing a more effective flow of goods and services countrywide&#13;
which has been otherwise hampered by the protracted conflict. And third, it would have a&#13;
considerable impact on improving accessibility to other more remote and poverty-&#13;
stricken regions of the country.&#13;
161. The improvements would restore pavement conditions to levels capable of catering&#13;
to an increasing traffic for about 5 to 7 years. The roads included under this sub-&#13;
component represent about 8 per cent of the main gravel road network and 8 percent of&#13;
the asphalt road network in the country. This is expected to increase the percentage of&#13;
roads in good condition and improve permanent accessibility of the network. In addition,&#13;
activities under the Roads sub-component will result in further strengthening districts'&#13;
capacity for road maintenance for the roads under their jurisdiction and respond to&#13;
emergency situations. The involvement of private domestic contractors in the works on&#13;
about 61 0-km of main roads, and more than 60 percent of the 500-km regional rural road&#13;
works, would contribute to enhancing the capacity of domestic contractors to participate&#13;
in future road works.&#13;

Appendix 4A: Road Rehabilitation/Improvement&#13;
Physical Investments and Rationale for Selection&#13;
162. The following activities will be included under this sub-component:&#13;
(i) Rehabilitation of primary and secondary roads to satisfy needs under the following&#13;
main categories:&#13;
* Roads affected by war totaling about 668 km including Wukro-Zalanbessa (55 km),&#13;
Gondar-Humera (80 km), Shire-Tekeze (100 km), Mekele-AbiAdi-Adwa (190 km),&#13;
Negelle-Filtu-Dollo (150 km) and Gondar-Tekeze-Shire (93 km);&#13;
* Roads that have deteriorated due to increased traffic flows in the general northern&#13;
area, as well as traffic diverted from the main road to the Port of Assab to the existing&#13;
road to the Port of Djibouti. The priority roads include: Gohatsion-Dejen (41 km),&#13;
and Dejen-Debre Markos (50 km);&#13;
* Roads connecting to persistent drought areas and serving an increased and constant&#13;
flow of relief cargo. The priority roads include Arbaminch-Jinka (80 km) and Goba-&#13;
Meslo-Bitata (120 km); and&#13;
* Roads sections with slowed down improvements in the past two years due to the&#13;
effects of the war including: Shashemane-Alaba (50 km), Robe-Ali Gassera-Ginir (50&#13;
km), Awassa-H/Mariamn (80 kmn), Bedelle-Metu (60 km), Wolkite-Hossaina (67 km),&#13;
and Jimma-Bonga (40 km).&#13;
(ii) Improvement of approximately 500 km of Regional Rural Roads in the war-affected&#13;
areas which have been impacted by increased traffic movement as a result of the war. The&#13;
works to be executed mainly by labor-based techniques will draw on the ongoing&#13;
programs executed in the regions with technical support from the ILO.&#13;
(iii) Procurement of equipment to replace road maintenance equipment missing after the&#13;
border closure at Assab, and procurement of spare parts for repair of equipment required&#13;
to strengthen regravelling, resealing and routine maintenance units in areas such as,&#13;
Adigrat, Gondar, Debremarkos, Combolcha and Dire Dawa districts which are unable to&#13;
resume normal operations.&#13;
(iv) Procurement of steel bridges (Bailey bridges) to replace bridges damaged during the&#13;
protracted conflict with Eritrea, as well as replenishment of ERA's stock of Bailey&#13;
bridges to increase its timely response to emergencies such as bridge washouts.&#13;
(v) Reconstruction/installation of selected bridges including the Abay Bridge and the&#13;
bridge on Dire Dawa-Dewelle and various roads.&#13;
(vi) Pre-construction investigations and Construction Supervision: ERA has already&#13;
assessed the condition of the roads with its 1999 traffic volumes to provide the basis for&#13;
the appraisal estimates. However, additional services to be provided include: (a) road&#13;
condition surveys to be carried out by the PMS unit of ERA to confirm the scope of&#13;
improvements required, prior to award of contracts; and (b) consultancy services required&#13;
for the supervision of works to be undertaken by both ERA force account units and by&#13;
(mainly) domestic contractors. In addition, the Regional Administration of Tigray has&#13;
-45-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4A: Road Rehabilitation/Improvement&#13;
requested that ILO be contracted to continue to provide technical advisory services for&#13;
the implementation of the labor-based road works in the region.&#13;
Component Cost&#13;
163. The total cost estimate of the Roads Sub-Component is US$91 million, excluding&#13;
taxes and duties, over the program period. The Government of Ethiopia will cover taxes&#13;
and duties of the equipment, spares and steel bridges to be procured and erection cost of&#13;
steel bridges. The total value of the Govenment's counterpart contribution net of taxes&#13;
and duties is estimated US$4.9 million. IDA's contribution would amount to US$86.1&#13;
million. The ILO's initial technical advisory services for preparation of the Regional&#13;
Rural Roads component are estimated at US$25,000.&#13;

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
164. The sub-component will be managed and implemented by the Ethiopian Roads&#13;
Authority in coordination with the Regional Rural Roads Authorities of Tigray and Afar&#13;
as applicable. With regard to ERA, its responsibilities will be carried out through its line&#13;
departments and district offices under the General Manager. ERA is comprised of three&#13;
main departments as follows: (i) Regulatory and Engineering Services Department,&#13;
which discharges its responsibilities through three Divisions: Planning and Programming,&#13;
Contracts Administration, and Design, Research and Network Management; (ii)&#13;
Operations Department, which has responsibility for force account maintenance,&#13;
emergency road construction and maintenance, and associated logistics support; and (iii)&#13;
Human Resource and Financial Management Department. Under its Planning and&#13;
Programming Division of the Regulatory and Engineering Services Department, ERA&#13;
has established six Branches responsible for Planning and Program Management,&#13;
Programming and Budgeting, Monitoring and Evaluation, Management Information&#13;
Systems (MIS), Environmental Management, and Rural Roads Technical Support. Since&#13;
-47-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4A: Road Rehabilitation/lmprovement&#13;
the start of the RSDP, ERA has also set up a Program Advisory Office (PAO) under the&#13;
General Manager. Staff of the PAO are supported by an RSDP Advisor (a senior highway&#13;
engineer/civil works contract administration specialist) funded by the European Union&#13;
(EU). The PAO advises the General Manager on matters related to program coordination,&#13;
including the coordination of TA and related multi-donor support and interests. The Road&#13;
Fund is now functioning through the Road Fund Administration under its General&#13;
Manager, and the Road Fund Board comprises representatives of the Federal&#13;
Government, Regional States, ERA and local stakeholders.&#13;
165. Based on lessons learned from the previous emergency project, Force Account&#13;
Units of ERA districts and mainly domestic contractors will execute the expected works.&#13;
ERA engineers and supervising consultants to be recruited by ERA will supervise the&#13;
works. ERA will manage the procurement, implementation, supervision and monitoring&#13;
of the whole works to ensure the quality of the works completed. The Ministry of&#13;
Defense will provide assistance for de-mining activities as and when required. Where&#13;
necessary, specialized services will be contracted for de-mining ahead of the road and&#13;
bridge works.&#13;
Annual Project Implementation Plan&#13;
166. ERA will prepare a Sub-component Project Implementation Plan to detail the&#13;
institutional, as well as procurement and implementation arrangements and schedules.&#13;
Institutional Capacity Assessment&#13;
167. ERA has demonstrated ample capacity for the management of the RSDP phase&#13;
including the administration of 95 contracts, 63 of which are ongoing and the rest are&#13;
being processed with financing by the Government and different donors. The capacity&#13;
therefore exists in ERA for contract administration and processing, and to provide&#13;
support and technical advice to the Regional Authorities as required.&#13;
168. The organizational setup of the Tigray Rural Roads Authority (TRRA) and four&#13;
other regions have recently been assessed with GTZ technical assistance, and a separate&#13;
report has been prepared. The TRRA has successfully implemented rural road&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance programs by force account. In addition, the ILO is&#13;
currently implementing a technical assistance program of labor-based road rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance in the Tigray and Amhara regions with Italian Cooperation financing.&#13;
The lessons learnt from the latter support have shown that, the scope of the program will&#13;
be beyond the capacity of the TRRA technical staff for administration and supervision,&#13;
and the force account units for sole execution. Additional consultancy support is&#13;
therefore to be provided under the sub-component to TRRA, as a continuation of the ILO&#13;
technical assistance services. TRRA will also be fully supported by the Rural Roads&#13;
Technical Support Branch of ERA which will coordinate the overall program activities&#13;
related to rural roads.&#13;

Appendix 4A. Road Rehabilitation/Improvement&#13;
Accounting, Audit and Reporting Arrangements and the Flow of Funds&#13;
169. ERA maintains entity accounts and is required to submit audit reports on such&#13;
accounts annually. For the purpose of this sub-component: (i) ERA and the RROs will&#13;
maintain accounts and records in accordance with International Accounting Standards to&#13;
enable all Project resources and expenditures to be clearly identified and accounted for;&#13;
(ii) these will be audited in accordance with International Standards on Auditing by the&#13;
Audit Services Corporation or any other independent auditor acceptable to IDA; and (iii)&#13;
the audit report and the audited financial statements, together with a management letter&#13;
covering the auditor's review of ERA's internal control structure, will be submitted to&#13;
IDA within six months of the end of the period to which they relate.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
170. Procurement processing will be started soon after appraisal to facilitate the early&#13;
start of activities after effectiveness. The activities to be started include for selected&#13;
urgent contracts, the advertisements, tender/bid and specifications preparation and&#13;
approval, pre-qualification and invitation of contractors, as well as preparation of TORs&#13;
and RFPs, identification and shortlisting of qualified consultants, to be followed by&#13;
evaluation of consultants' proposals and final selection. A procurement plan is being&#13;
prepared.&#13;
171. Government policy (by Letter of Sector Policy dated December 16, 1997) is to&#13;
encourage participation of domestic contractors in the road maintenance and construction&#13;
program. Under the sub-component, a major portion of the works contracts will be&#13;
awarded to private contractors (domestic mainly). The rest of the works will be executed&#13;
by ERA District Force Account units since all the units are expected to be more readily&#13;
mobilized in all districts, in view of the emergency nature of the works. The works will&#13;
be executed under the supervision of private consultants, and by appointed engineers of&#13;
ERA, only when considered to be most expedient, e.g., to oversee the installation of&#13;
Bailey bridges. The supervision consultants will be required to certify the correctness of&#13;
works quantities and amounts to be paid, submitted in payment certificates by&#13;
contractors, as well as by ERA force account units. Consultants will also be invited to&#13;
participate in pre-construction investigations, works preparation and quantification. ERA&#13;
will also purchase selected road maintenance equipment and construction materials&#13;
including Bailey Bridges. The ERP Procurement Manual to be ready by December 2000,&#13;
prepared in accordance with Bank Guidelines, describes the procedures to be adopted for&#13;
all procurement under the ERP as a whole.&#13;
172. In the case of works to be executed by contractors, the works will be awarded to&#13;
contractors using mainly National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures, in accordance&#13;
with IDA Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January&#13;
1995, Revised January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999.&#13;
173. Consultancy services will be awarded to qualifying consulting firms mainly&#13;
through Quality and Cost based Selection (QCBS), and in special cases with prior&#13;
approval of IDA through Sole-Source Selection or qualified individuals, depending upon&#13;
the nature of the services concerned, in accordance with IDA Guidelinesfor the Selection&#13;
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997, Revised&#13;
-49-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4A: Road Rehabilitation/Improvement&#13;
September 1997, and January 1999. The specialized technical advisory service to be&#13;
provided by ILO will be obtained through direct contracting with prior approval of IDA.&#13;
174. For specialized equipment and construction materials such as Bailey Bridges, ERA&#13;
will procure them by ICB, or NCB mainly, Direct Contracting, Shopping (National and&#13;
International) as appropriate, depending upon the items concerned, based on a&#13;
procurement plan agreed in advance with IDA, and in accordance with IDA Guidelines&#13;
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995, Revised January and&#13;
August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999.&#13;
Social and Environmental Impact&#13;
175. Two social issues are pertinent: (a) access to construction period employment by&#13;
local residents in the Project area; and (b) potential for increased transmission of&#13;
HIV/AIDS along the roads under this sub-component. The first concern, which is the&#13;
access to unskilled jobs associated with improvement of the roads, will be addressed&#13;
through an employment action plan for the main roads, and the labor-based technology&#13;
applied for rural roads improvements.&#13;
176. The risk of HIV/AIDS infection along the road improvement corridor is to be&#13;
addressed as part of ERA's recently developed strategy for the overall RSDP in Ethiopia.&#13;
The Environmental Management Branch of ERA has already developed a prevention&#13;
strategy that targets awareness creation in both the head office and construction projects.&#13;
This, together with the program being coordinated at the national level, will contribute to&#13;
minimizing the risk of transmission of the virus among road construction personnel.&#13;
177. There are no major environmental issues anticipated under this sub-component,&#13;
since it represents rehabilitation of existing roads only, with no changes in the alignment.&#13;
If there were any it would be limited in scope and duration. The potential impacts of the&#13;
activities are well known and can be effectively addressed through design, low cost&#13;
mitigation measures and proper construction monitoring. The contracts will include&#13;
specific environmental provisions and contractors will receive a briefing concerning these&#13;
requirements during the site visit. The Environmental Management Branch of ERA will&#13;
monitor the environmental mitigation actions, and provide advice as necessary.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
178. A baseline survey will be carried out to measure the indicators early after Credit&#13;
effectiveness, and before implementation of the major works under the Sub-component.&#13;
The comparison between baseline and future values measured half-yearly during&#13;
implementation, and annually as part of ERA's program of RSDP monitoring, would&#13;
provide a basis for the assessment of impacts. ERA will submit quarterly progress reports&#13;
through its Monitoring and Evaluation Branch to IDA covering all the activities, under the&#13;
sub-component. Performance indicators agreed with ERA and the Regional Rural Roads&#13;
Organizations will be measured so as to provide a basis for evaluating the impact of the&#13;
activities and to see whether the objectives are achieved. For the purpose of this sub-&#13;
component, six indicators have been identified, namely, vehicle operating cost saving,&#13;
road roughness, reduced travel time, traffic flow, and kilometers of road&#13;
improved/maintained. IDA supervision missions will also follow up on the&#13;
-50-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4A: Road Rehabilitation/Improvement&#13;
implementation of activities. The Supervising engineers and ERA, as required, shall also&#13;
monitor environmental mitigation measures. Within 3 months of the completion of the&#13;
Program, ERA will prepare its own inputs for the project implementation completion&#13;
report (ICR) and submit to IDA.&#13;
Studies and Technical Assistance Needed for Implementation&#13;
179. The ERA PMS Unit and the Planning and Programming Division will carry out&#13;
final surveys to confirm the condition of roads and quantities of works required for the&#13;
improvement of the main roads. In addition, during appraisal, ERA requested, and the&#13;
ILO confirmed that it would provide support to the TRRA under its ongoing program&#13;
financed by the Italian Cooperation. The consultants will carry out pre-construction&#13;
investigations including assessment of road conditions, preparation of contract documents&#13;
and training requirements. Technical advisory services will be continued under this&#13;
Project. It will include: provision of training, supervision and management of the regional&#13;
rural road works.&#13;
Action Plan&#13;
180. ERA shall: (a) Prepare the procurement plan and submit to IDA for review and&#13;
comment by October 20, 2000. The plan will be agreed upon and included in the project&#13;
implementation manual (see below) by December 2000; (b) Prepare the&#13;
implementation/operations manual including arrangements and schedule for the baseline&#13;
studies and submit to IDA for review and comment by November 15, 2000; and (c)&#13;
Prepare RFP/TORs and bid documents for goods, works and consultants and submit to&#13;
IDA for review by November 30, 2000.&#13;

Appendix 4B: Power Reconstruction/Rehabilitation&#13;
APPENDIX 4B: RECONSTRUCTION/REHABILITATION OF POWER SUPPLY&#13;
INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
181. The following activities will be financed under this sub-component:&#13;
Rehabilitation and reconstruction of power supply facilities: The aim is to rehabilitate and&#13;
reconstruct damaged power supply facilities, in the four towns of Zalambessa, Adigrat,&#13;
Bure, and Mekele in the war-affected areas. It involves the reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation of 65 Km of 15 Kv line, 27 Km of 0.4 Kv line, and 6 Km of street lights&#13;
along with the replacement/provision of 29 pieces of 50 and 63 KVA transformers, 2&#13;
pieces of 450 Kw diesel generators and, 550 Single phase customer connection in the&#13;
above-mentioned four towns. Some activities have already started in this regard in&#13;
Mekele and Adigrat that could be considered for retroactive financing.&#13;
Replacement of EEPCo's goods lost in Assab: The intention is to enhance the&#13;
implementation progress on: (1) the Ghedo - Gimbe transmission line works; (2) the&#13;
rehabilitation of the Koka and Tis-Abay power plants and substations; and (3) new&#13;
customer connections and maintenance of distribution line by replacing the Ethiopian&#13;
Electric Power Corporation's goods that were lost in the Assab Port after closure of the&#13;
border due to the conflict. The loss of these goods has severely hampered the country's&#13;
power infrastructure development program.&#13;
182. This sub-component would be financed by reprogramming resources of about&#13;
US$10 million from the ongoing IDA-financed Energy II Project.&#13;
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
183. The Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation, EEPCo will be the responsible agency&#13;
for implementing this sub-component. EEPCo already has an established unit (PMU)&#13;
responsible for coordination of project management activities for IDA-financed projects.&#13;
The existing set-up will be used for project co-ordination and management purposes. The&#13;
procurement of equipment will be done by the Procurement Division of EEPCo together&#13;
with the Engineering Department, Operations Support and the PMU. The rehabilitation&#13;
and reconstruction activities will be carried out by EEPCo's Regional Offices&#13;
Construction Unit and Power System Department (cost centers by themselves), while&#13;
technical supervision and verification of works done will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Engineering Department at the HQ of EEPCo. Co-ordination of the works, payment&#13;
processing and reporting will be the responsibility of the PMU. Quarterly progress&#13;
reports will be submitted.&#13;
Institutional Capacity Assessment&#13;
184. EEPCo is implementing the ongoing IDA-financed Energy II Project and its&#13;
implementation capacity is assessed to be adequate.&#13;
-52-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4B: Power Reconstruction/Rehabilitation&#13;
Accounting, Audit and Reporting Arrangements and the Flow of Funds&#13;
185. Current accounting and reporting arrangements under the Energy II project will be&#13;
used for ERP. In addition, EEPCo will have to report to the Federal ERPMU on the status&#13;
of its activities on the ERP. EEPCo will have its accounts, including its financial&#13;
statements, special account, and statements of expenditure audited by an independent&#13;
auditor acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
186. Since this sub-component will be implemented as part of the ongoing Energy II&#13;
project, the procurement procedures agreed in that project will apply. The procurement of&#13;
equipment will be done by the Procurement Division of the Corporation together with the&#13;
Engineering Department, Operations Support and the PMU.&#13;
Social and Environmental Impact&#13;
187. The activities would not have any adverse environmental impact as construction&#13;
activities would involve rehabilitation and reconstruction not new construction. The&#13;
potential impacts of the activities are well known and can be effectively addressed&#13;
through design, low cost mitigation measures and proper construction monitoring. The&#13;
contracts will include specific environmental provisions and contractors will receive a&#13;
briefing concerning these requirements during the site visit. The EEPCo PMU will&#13;
monitor the environmental mitigation actions, and provide advice as necessary.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
188. Quarterly progress reports will be submitted by the EEPCo PMU responsible for&#13;
coordination of project management activities for IDA-financed projects. Monitoring&#13;
indicators would include: km of distribution line reconstructed; number of customers re-&#13;
connected; km of street lights reinstalled; Ghedo - Gimbe transmission line works&#13;
completed as initially planned; customers connection and distribution line maintenance&#13;
enhanced as initially planned; rehabilitation works on the power plants and substations&#13;
restarted and completed; and the power shedding problem resolved.&#13;

Appendix 5: Procurement&#13;
APPENDIX 5: PROCUREMENT&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
189. Flexible Procurement Arrangements: Special attention has been paid to devise&#13;
procurement arrangements and procedures commensurate with the emergency nature of&#13;
the Project. In addition, the need has been recognized for simple mechanisms to facilitate&#13;
acquisition of materials and resources by households (farm, pastoralists, urban, etc.) in&#13;
dispersed locations. The arrangements devised are aimed at efficient procurement that&#13;
underpin quick disbursement and distribution of goods and money, mixing procurement&#13;
on the local market in the war-affected areas with procurement and distribution from&#13;
regional, national and international levels.&#13;
190. Manual of Procurement Procedures: A manual of Procurement Procedures under&#13;
the ERP is being prepared by the Borrower with assistance from the Bank. Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines and policies will be followed. The procedures for community-&#13;
based procurement have also been used, where applicable. Detailed procurement&#13;
arrangements are explained for each component in the relevant Technical Annex.&#13;
Types of Procurement&#13;
191. IDA will provide financing for goods on a positive import list, the proceeds of&#13;
which will be used to finance the household rehabilitation component. IDA will also&#13;
finance the goods, works and consultant services needed to implement the road&#13;
rehabilitation/improvement and de-mining components, and to operate the PMUs.&#13;
192. Community-based Procurement: Procurement for the Household Rehabilitation&#13;
component will follow Government procurement procedures. Each community will enter&#13;
into a simple agreement with their local government which sets out the benefit package&#13;
for each qualifying household. The contract will provide for release of funds to the&#13;
recipient who will, in turn, procure the specified items from the local market. For some&#13;
materials not locally available in adequate quantities, the PMU at the Federal level (or the&#13;
regional administration, as expedient) may award contracts and the regional&#13;
administration may undertake distribution of such goods. The release of funds will be&#13;
phased, where needed, with progress on the implementation. The committee approving&#13;
the package of support to the household etc. will, through the woreda level task force,&#13;
supervise and finally record satisfactory completion of the support program by the&#13;
recipient. This arrangement is similar to an arrangement already in use in some regions.&#13;
Another level of monitoring mechanisms operated by the Regional Administration will&#13;
provide further safeguards for ensuring that the money is used for the end use for which it&#13;
was approved. The PMU at the Federal level will have procurement audits conducted&#13;
every six months and agree with the Bank on any improvements needed in the system.&#13;
This procedure will be utilized for control of use of the counterpart funds allocated for&#13;
these components. Since counterpart funds are to be used, Bank guidelines and&#13;
procedures will not apply.&#13;
193. Positive Import List and Project Related Procurement: For the remaining&#13;
procurement, the tasks can be readily defined and procurement plans prepared. Relevant&#13;
Bank guidelines and procedures will operate for goods, works and services. Procurement&#13;
-54-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 5: Procurement&#13;
plans will be prepared and will provide the basis for agreement with IDA on the proposed&#13;
packaging and the optimal methods of procurement. Most of the procurement plans (to be&#13;
included in the Implementation Manual) will be ready by December 2000 and will&#13;
facilitate early implementation of the emergency project. The portion of the credit that&#13;
will be utilized for eligible imports, including retroactive financing, will require: (a) use&#13;
of a positive list, and (b) observance of the Bank's procurement principles. ERA's&#13;
procurement activity includes Force Account work for selected areas where justified and&#13;
enhancement of capacity in those cases where local contractors may not be available. The&#13;
use of Force Account will be monitored carefully.&#13;
194. Procurement methods will be subject to flexible limits on aggregate amounts to be&#13;
procured, thus giving the Borrower the option to choose the most suitable method of&#13;
procurement for any given case and to use easily accessible procedures such as national&#13;
competitive bidding, local and international shopping or direct contracting or force&#13;
account (with specific safeguards and controls). This will apply to "Other Procurement"&#13;
mentioned below.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements for Procurement&#13;
195. For those components where community-based procurement methods will apply,&#13;
selected items only will require to be procured by the management either by the Regional&#13;
Administration or the PMU at the Federal level. The sectoral bureaus at the regional level&#13;
have adequate capacity to procure the few items that they will need to procure.&#13;
196. The non-community based procurement (de-mining, etc.) would be undertaken by&#13;
the PMU at the Federal level (except Roads for which ERA will be responsible). At least&#13;
two procurement staff will be recruited in the Federal ERPMU. Special arrangements will&#13;
be made to recruit staff by redeployment from other IDA-financed projects who are well&#13;
versed in Bank procedures. They will conduct procurement for the relevant components&#13;
of the Project, except for the roads component (to be done by ERA) but including eligible&#13;
imports (and retroactive financing) and will also be responsible for the quality and&#13;
timeliness of procurement in the Project as a whole, including the roads component&#13;
implemented by ERA. They will prepare procurement plans for the items to be procured.&#13;
They will also monitor that adequate number of staff are always in position in each&#13;
individual component implementation unit and that all are afforded procurement training,&#13;
as needed. They will monitor use of Force Account by ERA. They will initiate periodic&#13;
procurement audits and take follow up action.&#13;
Procurement Procedures&#13;
197. IDA financed credit will be utilized for goods, training, consultancy, and operating&#13;
costs under the Project. Procurement for all IDA financed activities will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits (January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997, and&#13;
January 1999). Consulting services by firms or individuals will be awarded in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers (January 1997; Revised September 1997; Addendum Effective&#13;
January 1, 1999. Simplified procedures for Emergency projects will be used, wherever&#13;
needed.&#13;
-55-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 5: Procurement&#13;
198. Consultant selection for assignments will be addressed through competition among&#13;
qualified short-listed firms and individuals in which the selection will be based on&#13;
Quality-and-Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) by evaluation of the quality of the proposal&#13;
before comparing the cost of services to be provided. In addition, selection shall also be&#13;
done based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQ) and other methods as provided for in the&#13;
guidelines. Shortlists for contracts estimated to cost under US$100,000 may be&#13;
comprised entirely of national consultants if a sufficient number of qualified (at least&#13;
three) are available at competitive costs. However, if foreign firms have expressed&#13;
interest, they will not be excluded. Contracts less than US$100,000 each for firms, and&#13;
US$50,000 for individuals, could be contracted on the basis of CQ, and may be awarded&#13;
on a single source basis only in exceptional circumstances, after adequate justification&#13;
and prior review by IDA.&#13;
199. Procurement of goods will be carried out in accordance with Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1996, August 1996,&#13;
September 1997, January 1999). Contracts of individual value US$200,000 equivalent or&#13;
above will be awarded on the basis of ICB. Small value goods procurement contracts&#13;
(individual value of less than US$200,000) equivalent will be awarded on the basis of&#13;
NCB. Contracts up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$200,000 equivalent maybe&#13;
procured under community participation arrangements using the simplified formats set&#13;
forth in the Guidelines for Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for Community-&#13;
based Investments. Contracts less than US$30,000 each may be awarded through&#13;
National Shopping using approved procedures. The procedure to be adopted here is to&#13;
award fixed price contracts on the basis of written solicitation issued to at least three&#13;
qualified suppliers after evaluation of bids which would be received in writing.&#13;
200. Procurement of works will be carried out in accordance with Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1996, August 1996,&#13;
September 1997, January 1999). Larger contracts of individual value US$500,000&#13;
equivalent or above will be awarded on the basis of ICB. Small value works procurement&#13;
contracts (individual value of less than US$500,000) equivalent will be awarded on the&#13;
basis of NCB. Contracts up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$200,000 equivalent&#13;
maybe procured under community participation arrangements using the simplified&#13;
formats set forth in the Guidelines for Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for&#13;
Community-based Investments. Contracts less than US$30,000 each may be awarded&#13;
through National Shopping using approved procedures. The procedure to be adopted here&#13;
is to award lump sum fixed price contracts on the basis of written solicitation issued to at&#13;
least three qualified civil works contractors after evaluation of the bids which would be&#13;
received in writing.&#13;
201. Construction of certain infrastructure works and community facilities by Force&#13;
Account will be necessary, with certain safeguards. This is considered an acceptable&#13;
alternative to competitive bidding because the works are small and scattered, in many&#13;
instances in remote locations where experience has shown that contractors are either not&#13;
interested or their costs are unreasonably high. The works would be carried out by ERA.&#13;
The ERA has the needed construction plant to undertake this work. It is recognized that&#13;
contractor capacity may not be adequate. However, to ensure adequate usage of local&#13;
contractor capacity, the procurement plan for each year will use a judicious mix of force&#13;
-56-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 5: Procurement&#13;
account and local contractors, preference being given to local contractors and to keep&#13;
them fully loaded. The Force Account arrangement is however justified where the&#13;
organization, implementation and management of very small contracts is facilitated by&#13;
the flexibility provided by this method. Transparency and the establishment of true costs&#13;
of Force Accounts operations will be monitored by IDA Consequently, works that meet&#13;
the requirements of paragraph 3.8 of the Procurement Guidelines and subject to&#13;
utilization of local contractor capacity may be carried out by Force Account.&#13;
202. Training activities will comprise hiring consultants for training programs.&#13;
Procurement of these will also follow IDA procurement guidelines.&#13;
Prior Review Thresholds&#13;
203. For procurement of goods, all cases valued at US$200,000 or more will require&#13;
prior review by IDA.&#13;
204. For Works, all cases valued at US$500,000 or more will require prior review by&#13;
IDA.&#13;
205. The Bank will review the selection process for the hiring of consultants proposed&#13;
by the borrower for those consultancy contracts to be awarded to firms and individuals.&#13;
Prior review will not be required for contracts worth less than US$100,000 for firms and&#13;
contracts worth less than US$50,000 for individuals. However, IDA will review (a) all&#13;
Terms of Reference of contracts, regardless of value, (b) all single-source hiring, (c)&#13;
assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA, (d) amendments of contracts&#13;
raising the contract value above the prior review thresholds.&#13;
Risk Assessment&#13;
206. Overall Risk Assessment is rated as High.&#13;
207. The main components requiring procurement work will be (a) ERA, (b) de-mining,&#13;
and (c) some limited procurement by the Afar and Tigray regions. ERA will conduct the&#13;
procurement through its existing organizational set up which is assessed as quite&#13;
conversant with bank procedures. Besides a portion of the work will be on Force&#13;
Account. The Tigray and Afar regions will use existing procurement arrangements;&#13;
Tigray will hire an additional procurement officer. For the rest of the procurement, the&#13;
ERPMU will recruit three procurement specialists, initially for 2 years. To mitigate risk&#13;
in setting up a new organization for this purpose, government will re-deploy staff&#13;
experienced with bank procurement from ongoing bank-financed projects.&#13;
208. Frequency of procurement supervisions proposed: One every six months, including&#13;
special procurement supervision for post review and audits.&#13;

Appendix 6: Financial Management&#13;
APPENDIX 6: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
Overall Program Accounting, Auditing and Reporting Arrangements and Flow of&#13;
Funds&#13;
209. At the regional level, a Financial Management Unit (FMU) will be established in&#13;
the PMU, headed by an experienced financial manager, and staffed with appropriate&#13;
accountants. This FMU will be responsible for managing the Project Account and the&#13;
flow and use of funds advanced, especially for the household rehabilitation component.&#13;
Where the quantity and amount of transactions justifies it (such as in Tigray) FMU staff&#13;
will be attached to the Regional Finance Bureau, or even the Zonal Finance Department&#13;
to provide assistance. Funds will flow from the Federal local currency Project Account in&#13;
MEDaC to the appropriate Project Account in the Regions. Appropriate records will be&#13;
kept of the funds flow to each of the decentralized units, and the use that has been made&#13;
of these funds (e.g. the number and type of households rehabilitated). Each person or&#13;
household to receive support will be included on a listing of eligible beneficiary&#13;
households in their community which specifies their beneficiary packages. Funds would&#13;
be released, to the extent possible in cash, by the woreda finance offices according to an&#13;
agreed schedule and disbursement records will be maintained there for post review.&#13;
210. Two Special Accounts will be established in Foreign Exchange in the National&#13;
Bank of Ethiopia managed by ERA according to normal procedures acceptable to IDA&#13;
for the road rehabilitation component of the Project and by the ERPMU for the de-mining&#13;
and institutional support components. Local currency funds received from the sales of&#13;
foreign exchange for eligible expenditures from the positive list of imports, to be utilized&#13;
for the Household Rehabilitation Component, will be deposited in an Emergency&#13;
Recovery Program Fund Account in the National Bank of Ethiopia. The local currency&#13;
proceeds will then be sent to the decentralized units according to a calculation of&#13;
anticipated expenditure over the coming six months.&#13;
21 1. Financial management as well as disbursement of funds for the rehabilitation of&#13;
road infrastructure would be under the responsibility of the Finance Division of the&#13;
Human Resources and Finance Department of the Ethiopian Roads Authority. ERA's&#13;
Regional Rural Road Authority will manage the Program bank account at the regional&#13;
levels and would be responsible for effecting payment to contractors, beneficiaries, etc.&#13;
as required.&#13;
212. The community infrastructure, HIV/AIDS and the power rehabilitation components&#13;
will use existing accounts, resources and procedures as outlined in the three DCAs of the&#13;
ESRDF, EMSAP and Energy II projects from which funds will be reallocated for these&#13;
components. The ESRDF, EMSAP and Energy II projects will establish special project&#13;
accounts for their contribution to the ERP, and otherwise use existing procedures as&#13;
outlined in their respective DCAs. The DCA for the ESRDF project will be amended to&#13;
allow financing of the household rehabilitation component in the Afar region.&#13;
-58-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 6: Financial Management&#13;
Auditing&#13;
213. For the road rehabilitation, and de-mining components, financial statements will be&#13;
audited annually according to internationally accepted auditing procedures. For the&#13;
household rehabilitation component, local currency funds received from the sales of&#13;
foreign exchange for eligible expenditures from the positive list of imports will be&#13;
deposited in an ERP Fund Account. Standard Government financial procedures and flows&#13;
will be followed thereafter for the use of the ERP Account funds for the household&#13;
rehabilitation component. The annual auditing of the ERP Fund Account could be&#13;
potentially time-consuming given the dispersed geographical location of the source&#13;
documents (which could be either at the regional or sub-regional level). Consequently,&#13;
the Government has agreed to supplement its audit capacity by engaging external auditors&#13;
to assist it. For these audits independent private accounting firms with relevant&#13;
experience and competencies acceptable to IDA will be recruited on a competitive basis.&#13;
Joint Government/IDA supervision missions will make spot checks on a small sample of&#13;
the beneficiaries at their place of residence to verify the use of the funds disbursed.&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
214. In order to generate sufficient funds for the initial phase of the household&#13;
rehabilitation component and to cover previous eligible expenditures, retroactive&#13;
financing of up to 35 percent of the total Credit from June 18, 2000 has been agreed, on&#13;
an exceptional basis. The Government has been provided with a list of the documentation&#13;
that would be required in order to claim for reimbursements for imports from the positive&#13;
list that it has paid for (local currency funds received from the sales of foreign exchange&#13;
for eligible expenditures from the positive list of imports will be used to finance the&#13;
household rehabilitation component). In addition, a joint Government and Bank team is&#13;
being formed to compile and review the list of positive imports and related procurement&#13;
documentation totaling US$40 million to be disbursed as soon as the Credit is effective.&#13;

APPENDIX 7: MONITORING AND EVALUATION AND SOCIAL AND&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
215. Monitoring and evaluation will be tailored to the household/community infrastructure, de-&#13;
mining and road reconstruction components.&#13;
216. Household Rehabilitation: Monitoring for the household rehabilitation component will&#13;
consist of two parts. One will be periodic checks based on random sampling of communities and&#13;
households to ensure that beneficiaries received the cash that was due to them and that they used&#13;
it to purchase the agreed income generating assets and housing reconstruction materials. These&#13;
surveys will be used to confirm that funds generated from sales of goods on the positive import&#13;
list are used for the intended purpose before subsequent phased disbursements are released. The&#13;
other will be to determine if the support packages were sufficient for the beneficiary households&#13;
to restart their farming and other income generating activities and to better sustain themselves.&#13;
Prior to credit effectiveness a preliminary field survey will be conducted in the war-affected areas&#13;
to confirm beneficiary needs and housing reconstruction requirements, and to refine the terms of&#13;
reference for a social and environmental assessment. Within six months of credit effectiveness a&#13;
social and environmental assessment will be carried out to establish a baseline; it will be repeated&#13;
later to measure the impact of the Project. Field checks on beneficiary receipt and use of funds&#13;
would be undertaken by the Tigray PMU, by the participating woreda and tabia, and by the&#13;
ERPMU through independent auditors. The social and environmental assessments will be done by&#13;
external institutions or independent consultants.&#13;
217. Community Infrastructure: Monitoring of community infrastructure will be based on post&#13;
reviews to confirm that the agreed works have been constructed to specification and that&#13;
provision has been made to maintain them. Monitoring and evaluation would be undertaken by&#13;
the ESRDF Regional Offices in Tigray and Afar Regions, and by the ERPMU through&#13;
independent auditors.&#13;
218. De-mining: Monitoring for de-mining will include (i) oversight of the training being&#13;
provided to the expanded Ethiopian De-mining Project to ensure that personnel are trained to do&#13;
their jobs safely and effectively, and (ii) quality assurance by the quality control group within the&#13;
ERPMU to confirm that the de-mining work contracted to the EDP is done to agreed standards. A&#13;
team of international de-mining experts will review and advise on the implementation of the de-&#13;
mining program at least annually.&#13;
219. Road Reconstruction: Monitoring of road works and bridge construction will be based on&#13;
post reviews to confirm that the agreed works have been constructed to specification and that&#13;
provision has been made to maintain them. In addition, a baseline survey will be carried out to&#13;
measure the selected indicators before each part of the works is completed, and repeated&#13;
afterwards to measure the impact. For the purpose of this sub-component, indicators would be&#13;
vehicle operating cost saving, road roughness, reduced travel time, traffic flow, and kilometers of&#13;
road improved/maintained. Monitoring and evaluation would be undertaken by the ERA's&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Branch, and by the ERPMU through independent auditors.&#13;

Appendix 7: M&amp;E and Social and Environmental Aspects&#13;
Key Performance Indicators&#13;
Rehabilitation&#13;
* Transfer to households of at least 60% of the finances needed by the estimated 360,000&#13;
internally displaced persons within the war affected area to return to their homes and to restart&#13;
farming and other income generating activities.&#13;
*  Transfer to households of at least 60% of the finances needed by the estimated 11 0,000&#13;
deportees/returnees and 36,000 families of deceased civilians to restart/initiate income&#13;
generating activities.&#13;
De-mining&#13;
* De-mining carried out in the war affected area to allow at least 85% of the IDPs to return to their&#13;
homes, farms and pastures.&#13;
Reconstruction&#13;
* Rehabilitation/improvement of at least 500 km of primary and secondary roads.&#13;
* Improvement of at least 500 km of regional rural roads in the war-affected areas.&#13;
. Procurement of at least 1,500 meters of Bailey bridges to replace bridges damaged during the&#13;
conflict and to replenish ERA's emergency stocks.&#13;
Environmental and Social Aspects&#13;
220. The Program is classified as environmental category B because no component is expected&#13;
to have a significant environmental impact. The only construction that is envisaged is the&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation of war-damaged roads, bridges, housing, and community&#13;
infrastructure. In addition, the Project is expected to have a major positive environmental impact&#13;
through its contribution to de-mining a significant area of land, a large part of which is arable.&#13;
Rehabilitation assistance to the various groups of war-affected people will be designed to be&#13;
responsive to the needs, characteristics and aspirations of these people. The household&#13;
rehabilitation program will strive to address these specified needs and aspirations in a flexible&#13;
manner. For the household rehabilitation component, a preliminary field survey will be conducted&#13;
in the war-affected areas to confirm beneficiary needs and housing reconstruction requirements,&#13;
and to refine the TOR for the social and environmental assessment. The social and environmental&#13;
assessment will assess the potential environmental impacts associated with beneficiaries returning&#13;
to their communities, reconstructing their homes, and restarting their farming activities. In so&#13;
doing, relevant mitigation measures will be translated into implementation guidelines. The social&#13;
and environmental assessment will also be used to establish a baseline from which to evaluate the&#13;
success of the Project in re-establishing people in the homes and livelihoods.&#13;

            Ethiopia - Emergency Recovery Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Recovery Project will
            assist Ethiopia in helping the war-affected people rebuild
            their lives, and resume productive economic activities,
            reconstruct and rehabilitate destroyed, and damaged
            infrastructure, to restart the provision of services, and,
            support macroeconomic stability in the country. The project
            will finance household rehabilitation in Tigray; mine
            clearing; and, road rehabilitation and improvement. In
            addition, reallocations from existing International
            Development Association (IDA) credits, will finance other
            elements of the program, including household rehabilitation
            in Afar, community infrastructure rehabilitation, HIV/AIDS
            prevention, care and support, and,
            rehabilitation/improvement of power supply infrastructure.
            The main expected benefit of the program will be to mitigate
            the consequences of the ongoing humanitarian crisis, by
            providing assistance to the war-affected people in
            rebuilding their lives, and resume productive economic
            activities, as well as to lay the basis for long-term
            recovery, through infrastructure rehabilitation.
            Nonetheless, the resumption of hostilities is the major
            external risk, while project specific risks are linked to
            weak implementation capacity. The credit will be disbursed
            by December 31, 2003, and, retroactive financing - up to a
            certain amount - has been approved for expenditures made
            after June 18, 2000.
