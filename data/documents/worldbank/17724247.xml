         MR. STEK:    Let's start our meeting.&#13;
&#13;
         The first item is the minutes of the meeting of&#13;
&#13;
April 23 of this year.&#13;
&#13;
         Are there any comments on the minutes?&#13;
&#13;
         [No response.]&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:    There are no comments on the minutes,&#13;
&#13;
and no second chance for those who come late to talk about&#13;
&#13;
them under other business.      This is the final opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
The minutes are approved.&#13;
&#13;
         Then, we turn to our main item on the agenda,&#13;
&#13;
which many of us have been waiting for eagerly.           These are&#13;
&#13;
the reports on poverty prepared by PREM and by the Poverty&#13;
&#13;
Reduction Group.&#13;
&#13;
         The Bank has been mandated by the IDA Deputies&#13;
&#13;
to produce a yearly report on trends in poverty, and this&#13;
&#13;
is the seventh such report.      It provides us a summary&#13;
&#13;
update of trends in poverty reduction around the world and&#13;
&#13;
also reviews how Bank activities have fitted in.           the&#13;
&#13;
other report is the one that a number of us have really&#13;
&#13;
been asking for for quite some time, and that is&#13;
&#13;
"Attacking Poverty:    Operationalizing the WDR."         It&#13;
&#13;
presents the steps that the Bank has taken to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        4&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
operationalize the concepts of opportunity, empowerment,&#13;
&#13;
and security.&#13;
&#13;
         They are both going to be dealt with in the&#13;
&#13;
Board, these reports, quite soon, on June the 12th, next&#13;
&#13;
week, so by the end of our discussion, I would like us to&#13;
&#13;
have focused on the critical questions and issues that we&#13;
&#13;
feel warrant further discussion by the Board next Tuesday.&#13;
&#13;
So that is the task that we have--not to reach agreement,&#13;
&#13;
or anything like that; if we can, that is great--but what&#13;
&#13;
is left for urgent consideration by the Board.            I think we&#13;
&#13;
are gradually beginning to note that effective work in the&#13;
&#13;
committees does shorten Board sessions, and I hope that we&#13;
&#13;
will succeed this time, too.&#13;
&#13;
         We sent out an Issues Note to you all to help&#13;
&#13;
focus; I hope it has proven to be helpful.            There are&#13;
&#13;
copies, of course, at the back.&#13;
&#13;
         Giovanna Prennushi is here to make the&#13;
&#13;
presentation.&#13;
&#13;
         John, I don't know whether you want to say&#13;
&#13;
something or not.    There are two Johns sitting next to&#13;
&#13;
each other, but let's talk to John Page for a moment.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. PAGE:     Thank you, Pieter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       5&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         Only to say that, one, we are grateful for this&#13;
&#13;
opportunity to hear your views before the Board&#13;
&#13;
discussion.   The documents were circulated concurrently&#13;
&#13;
for both discussion by CODE and the full Board, but we&#13;
&#13;
have found in the past that the CODE discussion helps us&#13;
&#13;
to shape the larger discussion with the full Board, so we&#13;
&#13;
are quite anxious to hear your views.&#13;
&#13;
         We also recognize that it has been something of&#13;
&#13;
a long and a bit winding road to come to the paper on&#13;
&#13;
operationalizing the WDR, and we recognize that to some&#13;
&#13;
extent it overlaps with the content of the poverty&#13;
&#13;
progress report.&#13;
&#13;
         Our initial take on this is to think that after&#13;
&#13;
the Board discussion and this discussion, we would&#13;
&#13;
actually look to combine the two into a single paper which&#13;
&#13;
could be used to address a wider audience on the progress&#13;
&#13;
and prospects for the Bank's work on poverty.&#13;
&#13;
         As you have noted, we have a number of&#13;
&#13;
colleagues here from OPCS, from the Regions, members of&#13;
&#13;
the Poverty Sector Board, so I think we are fairly well-&#13;
&#13;
set to answer questions of substance and detail.&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     6&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         Having said that, we will ask Giovanna to&#13;
&#13;
introduce both papers at the same time so that we can&#13;
&#13;
begin a joint discussion of the two.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:   Thanks, John.&#13;
&#13;
         "Combining" means that you have super-sized&#13;
&#13;
paperclips?&#13;
&#13;
         MR. PAGE:   [Inaudible comment; no microphone.]&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:   I see.&#13;
&#13;
         Giovanna, you have the floor, and after that, I&#13;
&#13;
think OED wants to say a few words, too.&#13;
&#13;
         Giovanna.&#13;
&#13;
         MS. PRENNUSHI:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
         It is a pleasure to be here again.          This is the&#13;
&#13;
third time that I have had the opportunity to discuss the&#13;
&#13;
annual poverty progress report with you, and it has always&#13;
&#13;
been a very interesting discussion, so I am really looking&#13;
&#13;
forward to doing it again this year.&#13;
&#13;
         Since we met on this topic last year, there has&#13;
&#13;
been one very important step, among others, and that has&#13;
&#13;
been the publication of the World Development Report on&#13;
&#13;
Poverty which was launched at the Annuals Meetings in&#13;
&#13;
Prague last September.&#13;

                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     7&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         You have asked us at several occasions, and we&#13;
&#13;
agreed at the discussion of the annual progress report&#13;
&#13;
last year at the Board that we would report to you on&#13;
&#13;
progress in translating the WDR into concrete actions,&#13;
&#13;
into what the Bank is doing.&#13;
&#13;
         So this year, we come back not just with the&#13;
&#13;
annual progress report on poverty, but also with this&#13;
&#13;
paper on operationalizing the WDR.       The two documents&#13;
&#13;
cover similar ground but from different angles.         The&#13;
&#13;
progress report focuses, much like in the last few years,&#13;
&#13;
on progress in achieving the International Development&#13;
&#13;
Goals and on the poverty focus of Bank activities while&#13;
&#13;
the paper on operationalizing the WDR looks more&#13;
&#13;
specifically at how the Bank is undertaking actions to&#13;
&#13;
foster opportunities, empowerment, and security.&#13;
&#13;
         As John mentioned, we would like to suggest&#13;
&#13;
combining the two for public dissemination, but we can&#13;
&#13;
discuss that later.&#13;
&#13;
         What do these reports say?        In a nutshell, they&#13;
&#13;
say that much has been accomplished; that the poverty&#13;
&#13;
focus of Bank activities is stronger through a clearer&#13;
&#13;
strategic framework and clearer country business models&#13;
&#13;
for low-income and middle-income countries; that our&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      8&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
Country Assistance and Sector Strategies are more closely&#13;
&#13;
linked with the goal of poverty reduction, and that our&#13;
&#13;
operations are better inserted into Country Assistance&#13;
&#13;
Strategies that build on country-owned poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
and development strategies.&#13;
&#13;
         At the same time, challenges remain, as usual.&#13;
&#13;
More in detail, the poverty progress report looks at&#13;
&#13;
progress in achieving the International Development Goals,&#13;
&#13;
and as you know, progress has not been fast enough to&#13;
&#13;
achieve the goals; but countries that have had success are&#13;
&#13;
those that have been able to grow fast and have good&#13;
&#13;
policies and institutions.     In these settings, aid has&#13;
&#13;
been effective.&#13;
&#13;
         This has led to an approach in providing aid&#13;
&#13;
which focuses on country ownership, on partnership across&#13;
&#13;
agencies, and on supporting reforms for which there is&#13;
&#13;
commitment.&#13;
&#13;
         How is the Bank working to operationalize the&#13;
&#13;
WDR and increase the impact of its actions on poverty?          As&#13;
&#13;
I mentioned, the Strategic Framework and the business&#13;
&#13;
models are closely aligned with the mission of reducing&#13;
&#13;
poverty, and for low-income countries, the PRSP approach&#13;
&#13;
in its emphasis on finding solutions that are country-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        9&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
owned and that are based on a deep understanding of the&#13;
&#13;
poverty situation in a country really represents a key&#13;
&#13;
tool to operationalizing the WDR within countries.&#13;
&#13;
         There have been cases in which the development&#13;
&#13;
of poverty reduction strategies have actually drawn on&#13;
&#13;
some of the work that was done for the WDR--for example,&#13;
&#13;
on Voices of the Poor--and these are interesting examples&#13;
&#13;
of our deeper understanding of the nature of poverty, such&#13;
&#13;
as in Vietnam, and have led to a deeper understanding of&#13;
&#13;
the kinds of actions that are needed to deal with it.&#13;
&#13;
         Bank guidance and policies are better aligned&#13;
&#13;
with the mission.    Sector strategies are changing.          There&#13;
&#13;
is much more focus now than there was a few years ago on&#13;
&#13;
the linkages between actions in the sector and their&#13;
&#13;
impact on indicators of poverty.         The Environment Strategy&#13;
&#13;
that we mention in the documents is a good example of&#13;
&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
         CASs and Bank operations are better linked to&#13;
&#13;
national strategies.     I will just cite, for example, the&#13;
&#13;
Ghana CAS, but also, in non-PRSP countries such as India,&#13;
&#13;
the link with national development strategies and with&#13;
&#13;
country-owned policies is stronger than it was in the&#13;
&#13;
past.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     10&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
          At the same time, we still find that CASs are&#13;
&#13;
weak in terms of monitoring indicators and on evaluating&#13;
&#13;
the impact of past interventions.      This area of monitoring&#13;
&#13;
and evaluation is clearly one where we need to place&#13;
&#13;
emphasis in the future, because it is crucial if we really&#13;
&#13;
want to see progress in terms of achieving results on the&#13;
&#13;
ground.&#13;
&#13;
          There have also been significant changes in the&#13;
&#13;
way the Bank does business in terms, for example, of our&#13;
&#13;
ability and capacity to work with countries, respect&#13;
&#13;
country ownership, and work in partnership with others.&#13;
&#13;
          One example of this is the work that we have&#13;
&#13;
done jointly with the IMF in the poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
strategy approach. This is something where we have really&#13;
&#13;
made a lot of progress in the last year.&#13;
&#13;
          Looking ahead, there are some ares where we will&#13;
&#13;
focus our efforts.   In terms of the WDR areas, to enhance&#13;
&#13;
opportunities, we will continue to focus on promoting&#13;
&#13;
growth but will increase attention to its institutional&#13;
&#13;
underpinnings and the distributional consequences of&#13;
&#13;
different patterns of growth.     We will work to increase&#13;
&#13;
our understanding of what pro-poor growth means.         In this&#13;
&#13;
respect, we have been doing quite a bit of work recently&#13;

&#13;
in the context of the Poverty Reduction Sourcebook, and we&#13;
&#13;
will soon have a chapter that discusses these issues.&#13;
&#13;
           But we have also been doing a lot of work on&#13;
&#13;
social and impact analysis so that we are better able to&#13;
&#13;
understand the impact of policies on different groups in&#13;
&#13;
society.&#13;
&#13;
           To facilitate empowerment consistent with our&#13;
&#13;
mandate, we will work to enhance inclusion and&#13;
&#13;
participation in Bank work as well as strengthen local&#13;
&#13;
organizations such as what we are doing with the&#13;
&#13;
community-driven development and at the same time help&#13;
&#13;
governments to strengthen their capacity to provide&#13;
&#13;
services and be more accountable to their people, as well&#13;
&#13;
as enhancing access to information.&#13;
&#13;
           A guidance note to staff on empowerment is being&#13;
&#13;
prepared, so we are discussing in detail what empowerment&#13;
&#13;
means in terms of Bank actions.&#13;
&#13;
           To enhance security, we will work more&#13;
&#13;
systematically to implement a social risk management&#13;
&#13;
framework as well as continue to work on prevention and&#13;
&#13;
mitigation of conflict and disaster.&#13;
&#13;
           In terms of how we work, if you wish, Bank&#13;
&#13;
culture and so on, the challenge ahead is to better&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
integrate our knowledge and activities at the sectoral&#13;
&#13;
level and at the macro and country level.           So while we&#13;
&#13;
have made progress, for example, in working more closely&#13;
&#13;
with the IMF, we have made some progress in working across&#13;
&#13;
sectoral boundaries.    But much remains to be done.&#13;
&#13;
         There are good examples that you have seen&#13;
&#13;
recently, and most recently, I would say the Uganda PRSC,&#13;
&#13;
but that is really work that we need to focus on in the&#13;
&#13;
next year.&#13;
&#13;
         In sum, we believe that these two reports&#13;
&#13;
highlight a considerable amount of progress that has been&#13;
&#13;
made, and we should also recognize that this has been done&#13;
&#13;
in partnership with client countries and with other&#13;
&#13;
agencies, so this is not really just our own individual&#13;
&#13;
accomplishment as an institution.&#13;
&#13;
         We look forward to a productive discussion with&#13;
&#13;
you, and we especially look forward to your help in&#13;
&#13;
highlighting key issues for Board discussion.&#13;

&#13;
            OED staff have interacted with Management on&#13;
&#13;
these two documents, drawing on an OED paper that was&#13;
&#13;
discussed by CODE in March of 2000 titled "Poverty&#13;
&#13;
Reduction in the 1990s:     An Evaluation of Strategy and&#13;
&#13;
Performance."    We have also done work on the IDA Review on&#13;
&#13;
Poverty, as you know.     And I have to say that many&#13;
&#13;
comments from OED have been taken into account in these&#13;
&#13;
drafts.    But I want to make four points in my introductory&#13;
&#13;
comments.&#13;
&#13;
            The first gives a perspective on the record and&#13;
&#13;
the challenge, and the next three note areas where the&#13;
&#13;
proposed strategy can be strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
            First, if you look at the record and the&#13;
&#13;
challenge, the record is that from 1987 to 1998, the&#13;
&#13;
number of poor, around 1.2 billion, is little changed,&#13;
&#13;
although the proportion of poor has fallen from 28 percent&#13;
&#13;
to 23 percent, which is actually a fairly remarkable&#13;
&#13;
outcome.&#13;
&#13;
            The International Development Goals are&#13;
&#13;
proposing that the percentage of poor be halved from the&#13;
&#13;
1990 to around 14 percent by 2015.         It is clear from the&#13;
&#13;
two papers that continuing past trends will not achieve&#13;
&#13;
that goal, so the problem is to reduce the percent of poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      14&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
more quickly, which means increasing the growth rate of&#13;
&#13;
incomes and improving the quality of growth.&#13;
&#13;
          What they have done is essentially reverse-&#13;
&#13;
engineer the goals to say to get there, what do we have to&#13;
&#13;
do.   And reverse-engineering suggests that incomes have to&#13;
&#13;
grow at around 3.7 percent.&#13;
&#13;
          This is a high average growth rate.          History&#13;
&#13;
suggests that it is within the range of possibilities.&#13;
&#13;
For example, from 1973 to 1989, Angus Madison has&#13;
&#13;
estimated that Asian incomes grew by about 4.2 percent,&#13;
&#13;
which is in fact a little above the 3.7 percent.          But the&#13;
&#13;
challenge of this goal is also indicated by his estimates&#13;
&#13;
for Latin America over the same time period, 0.6 percent,&#13;
&#13;
and Africa, minus 0.3 percent, while OECD countries grew&#13;
&#13;
at 2.1 percent.   So this gives you some perspective that&#13;
&#13;
3.7 percent is a big number.&#13;
&#13;
          It is obvious that policy changes will be&#13;
&#13;
required to increase the speed and quality of growth.&#13;
&#13;
          Suggestions on how to proceed are set forth in&#13;
&#13;
the paper "Attacking Poverty."      Let me make three&#13;
&#13;
observations.&#13;
&#13;
          First, a point really at the end of Giovanna's&#13;
&#13;
comments--the need for integration.        The paper sets forth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        15&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
the main elements of a program and policy.            It proposes to&#13;
&#13;
draw on the increased poverty orientation of recent sector&#13;
&#13;
strategy papers, to incorporate and adapt these sector&#13;
&#13;
strategies to country conditions within the CAS, the&#13;
&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy, and PRSPs, and thirdly, to&#13;
&#13;
exploit the insights of the recent WDR on the multi-&#13;
&#13;
dimensional nature of poverty in order to add value to the&#13;
&#13;
country strategies and the PRSPs.&#13;
&#13;
         A remaining and ongoing challenge is obviously&#13;
&#13;
how to integrate these diverse elements into successful&#13;
&#13;
programs at the country level.        And I must say that we&#13;
&#13;
appreciate the frankness of the document about the&#13;
&#13;
challenge of incorporating empowerment.&#13;
&#13;
         What will be needed as quickly as possible are&#13;
&#13;
lessons of experience about practical applications of the&#13;
&#13;
WDR elements--opportunity, empowerment, and security--into&#13;
&#13;
country programs.    In particular, information on how&#13;
&#13;
priorities and payoffs vary with country conditions will&#13;
&#13;
be most valuable.&#13;
&#13;
         The second overarching point is the issues of&#13;
&#13;
monitoring and evaluation and capacity-building.            Success&#13;
&#13;
with poverty reduction will require improved monitoring&#13;
&#13;
and evaluation capacity at the country level.            OED has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        16&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
documented past failures in this area, and they are also&#13;
&#13;
documented in the progress report before you.&#13;
&#13;
          More emphasis can be given to monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
evaluation, and must be given to monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
evaluation, and also to impact analysis.&#13;
&#13;
          On a somewhat different direction, in many&#13;
&#13;
countries, baseline data is an issue, and existing data&#13;
&#13;
sources are contradictory, and there is some interesting&#13;
&#13;
information given in the progress report about that.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, more attention needs to be given to capacity-&#13;
&#13;
building at the country level--for data, for monitoring,&#13;
&#13;
and for evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
          A third overarching comments is on resource&#13;
&#13;
needs.   It would be useful to have a clearer picture of&#13;
&#13;
the resources needed to implement this poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
program both from the Bank and from borrower countries.&#13;
&#13;
The paper seems to suggest that this will be done mostly&#13;
&#13;
through reallocation.      More precision on this dimension&#13;
&#13;
would be welcome.     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. STEK:    I'm glad you mentioned that last&#13;
&#13;
point, because it struck me that paragraph 95 didn't give&#13;
&#13;
the information that we would like to see.&#13;
&#13;
          I open the floor for members.&#13;

&#13;
         Matthias, please.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. MEYER:     Thanks.&#13;
&#13;
         We welcome these two papers very much.            This is&#13;
&#13;
a crucial element of the Bank's work, and we would like to&#13;
&#13;
see it streamlined, reinforced, and somewhat more&#13;
&#13;
timebound.    This leads me right away to maybe a bit of a&#13;
&#13;
deception in the sense that we would have expected a&#13;
&#13;
little bit more of a kind of integrated program of next&#13;
&#13;
steps and not what is a little bit of a disjunctive list&#13;
&#13;
of lots of areas which are extremely important--but then&#13;
&#13;
again, many things are important, and we can't see where&#13;
&#13;
we are really going, where we are putting the money and&#13;
&#13;
where are we putting the energy to make a move forward.&#13;
&#13;
         What is very good, I think, is that we can see&#13;
&#13;
that there is really a gearing up and lots of interesting&#13;
&#13;
experiences being mentioned in these new areas of the&#13;
&#13;
poverty definition--although I must say that, as always, I&#13;
&#13;
wonder whether it is really the WDR which has contributed&#13;
&#13;
to this, or are these just collected experiences which&#13;
&#13;
have happened anyhow with the richness of country&#13;
&#13;
experience and with the innovative minds we have in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank staff.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       18&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         So the question is do we really have a&#13;
&#13;
direction, and are we putting an effort into this.           And in&#13;
&#13;
that sense, I would just like to take the summary, the&#13;
&#13;
next steps, in the second document on the WDR, in&#13;
&#13;
paragraph 108.   What we would plead for is that we get to&#13;
&#13;
an economy of poverty reduction to a comprehensive system.&#13;
&#13;
I think this takes up very much the points that Greg made&#13;
&#13;
on integration and on resources.&#13;
&#13;
         In that sense, we see basically four elements.&#13;
&#13;
First, we have to explore poverty more.            In that sense, I&#13;
&#13;
think that refers to the    causative studies which are&#13;
&#13;
mentioned, kind of a toolkit for ESW, and at the same&#13;
&#13;
time, the research on links, the question of pro-poor&#13;
&#13;
growth, the question of inequality in relationship with&#13;
&#13;
poverty, and all that.&#13;
&#13;
         Here, frankly, I don't know whether we can&#13;
&#13;
continue, as it is mentioned here, to mention, as in one&#13;
&#13;
paragraph, the increased delivery of country-level ESW,&#13;
&#13;
just a kind of list of poverty, gender vulnerability,&#13;
&#13;
public expenditure, financial management, business&#13;
&#13;
environment, institution and governance--and I think we&#13;
&#13;
could probably add about five or six more.           Shouldn't we&#13;
&#13;
also try to streamline and somehow get some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        19&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
rationalization of the effort, and in that sense, a&#13;
&#13;
strengthening of the effort, because we cannot do all of&#13;
&#13;
these studies.   Are we doing some of them in some&#13;
&#13;
countries, others in others?        Do we do the same studies&#13;
&#13;
with other names, which I often have the impression.            We&#13;
&#13;
have the whole institutional aspects, governance aspects;&#13;
&#13;
we have the social assessments, we have the poverty&#13;
&#13;
assessments.   I think we are always getting in each&#13;
&#13;
other's way. So I think there is a clear need there to&#13;
&#13;
move forward in terms of concepts, in terms of toolkits,&#13;
&#13;
and in terms of methods.&#13;
&#13;
         The second big category is country and project&#13;
&#13;
methods to measure the poverty impact of Bank activities.&#13;
&#13;
This is the only way that we can really get to good&#13;
&#13;
monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
         It is being said in both reports that we have&#13;
&#13;
now a manual on this with, apparently, quite good results&#13;
&#13;
and good methods.    I haven't seen it, but I think that is&#13;
&#13;
something that maybe we should take up even in the Board,&#13;
&#13;
in a committee, because this is so important.            But if this&#13;
&#13;
is true, why do these methods on impact not translate into&#13;
&#13;
projects and programs, because we know that at the same&#13;
&#13;
time, there is only a minority of programs which actually&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     20&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
include such methods in their analysis even at the present&#13;
&#13;
time. So how do we get to translate that into operations?&#13;
&#13;
I think that is the key question.      And from there comes&#13;
&#13;
also, then, the need to somehow have guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
         We have all of these wonderful guidelines cited&#13;
&#13;
for next year--poverty reduction--what are we going to say&#13;
&#13;
in an OP/BP on poverty reduction?      Don't we already know&#13;
&#13;
what has to go in there and what is the time line for that&#13;
&#13;
and how we are going to get there?       The same for the&#13;
&#13;
institutional and social analyses and also the effort of&#13;
&#13;
integrating the different kinds of analyses on projects&#13;
&#13;
and programs.&#13;
&#13;
         I think it would be very important to know if&#13;
&#13;
there is a clear concept of how to prepare such a policy,&#13;
&#13;
and when is this policy going to be presented, and what do&#13;
&#13;
we have to look forward to.&#13;
&#13;
         The third big element, I think, is the sector&#13;
&#13;
and thematic strategy, and I think this may be one of the&#13;
&#13;
areas where there is most hope or most accomplishment&#13;
&#13;
already in the sense that I think we can clearly see that&#13;
&#13;
poverty aspects are being taken account of each time that&#13;
&#13;
a new strategy is being presented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       21&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
           At the same time, again, we have to be very&#13;
&#13;
careful.   Environment has been mentioned as a good&#13;
&#13;
example.   This is exactly an example where I think we also&#13;
&#13;
have to be very clear on what is not directly related to&#13;
&#13;
poverty in the strategy.     I think we shouldn't just say&#13;
&#13;
that environment and poverty are the same and are very&#13;
&#13;
strongly linked.   There are very strong links which are&#13;
&#13;
explored in that strategy, which are very good.           Then,&#13;
&#13;
there is the global commons, and then there is the so-&#13;
&#13;
called quality of growth under the environmental aspect,&#13;
&#13;
which has not much to do with poverty.          It is poverty-&#13;
&#13;
neutral.   It might be anti-poverty-positive in the long&#13;
&#13;
term, indirectly, but let's not pretend that there is a&#13;
&#13;
strong positive link in the short term, and then, because&#13;
&#13;
of that, if there isn't, not give priority to these&#13;
&#13;
activities on environment.      So I think there is a question&#13;
&#13;
there also of being concrete and being operational, and I&#13;
&#13;
think that still has to become clear.&#13;
&#13;
           The fourth aspect is the capacity-building both&#13;
&#13;
for staff and in-country, and I don't want to go into&#13;
&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
           But just to take up one or two other points, the&#13;
&#13;
PRSP is mentioned also in this list.         Of course, the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      22&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
is essential; basically, it is a source.           And at the same&#13;
&#13;
time, what the Bank can do to help countries improve the&#13;
&#13;
PRSPs is exactly the work on methods and best practices&#13;
&#13;
and be able to discuss these with the countries.          It is&#13;
&#13;
not really in that sense a source in terms of methods.&#13;
&#13;
         Just to take up, for instance, Bolivia, which we&#13;
&#13;
talked about yesterday, decentralization--what can&#13;
&#13;
municipalities do when they get HIPC money, the poorest&#13;
&#13;
particularly.   We are really skeptical about what is going&#13;
&#13;
to happen.   I just read that in Mexico, there was a very&#13;
&#13;
interesting decentralization program which apparently was&#13;
&#13;
very successful which we are going to discuss this&#13;
&#13;
afternoon.   Are there best practices in terms of&#13;
&#13;
decentralization which in a PRSP in Bolivia can be used?&#13;
&#13;
         So in that sense, I think the PRSPs are&#13;
&#13;
important, but not necessarily as a source for methods.&#13;
&#13;
         Community-driven development is mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
Frankly, that always leaves me perplexed, because first of&#13;
&#13;
all, this has never been really mentioned to us and has&#13;
&#13;
never been presented as a program to the Board or as a new&#13;
&#13;
line of business as far as I know.        It has been mentioned&#13;
&#13;
for years, but I have never seen a document.&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
          When I see the examples which are given here on&#13;
&#13;
community-driven development, some of them are common&#13;
&#13;
sense and have been around for 20 to 30 years.          We have&#13;
&#13;
already been concerned about village councils and&#13;
&#13;
financing of schools by the local community 20 or 30 years&#13;
&#13;
ago--this is not new.    Water users associations do not&#13;
&#13;
come from the WDR; these were started a long time ago.&#13;
&#13;
          So what is the essence--is it just a new label,&#13;
&#13;
or are we really going in that direction, and what is the&#13;
&#13;
policy that we are trying to pursue?        Of course, it has a&#13;
&#13;
lot to do with empowerment, but do we have a policy?&#13;
&#13;
Because here, we talk about monitoring a policy in the&#13;
&#13;
future.   So let's first talk about the policy and have a&#13;
&#13;
clear vision.&#13;
&#13;
          In respect to the Management proposals, finally,&#13;
&#13;
we have always been for abandoning the PTI category; we&#13;
&#13;
don't think that was sufficient in terms of poverty, and&#13;
&#13;
so we certainly agree on that one.&#13;
&#13;
          There was another proposal which I guess others&#13;
&#13;
are going to take up--the focus on the International&#13;
&#13;
Development Goals, streamlining reporting to the Board.           I&#13;
&#13;
think we agree on that. We have to find a new format to&#13;
&#13;
talk about and discuss poverty and progress than those&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                        24&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
different reports that we get, and I think we should talk&#13;
&#13;
about it.&#13;
&#13;
            On the IDGs, I think that is another topic which&#13;
&#13;
we may have to take up at another time.             We are quite&#13;
&#13;
skeptical about whether it can really serve as a method,&#13;
&#13;
but we certainly agree that it stays there as a point of&#13;
&#13;
reference.&#13;
&#13;
            Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. STEK:    Thank you very much for a very good&#13;
&#13;
start, Matthias, on those issues.&#13;
&#13;
            Finn Jonck, please.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. JONCK:   Thank you, Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
            It is hard to follow Matthias' very broad&#13;
&#13;
statement, but let me make just a few points.&#13;
&#13;
            First, our expectation of a poverty progress&#13;
&#13;
report--I will deal with that first--is that we would have&#13;
&#13;
and that the Board would receive a dynamic report on three&#13;
&#13;
issues--on poverty trends over the paste year or past&#13;
&#13;
years; second, on processes and initiatives, particularly,&#13;
&#13;
of course, initiatives taken by the Bank; and thirdly, on&#13;
&#13;
results or impact, whatever you call it.&#13;
&#13;
            All of these issues, I think, are dealt with in&#13;
&#13;
the progress report that we have before us.            The question&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        25&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
that we ask ourselves is whether we have the balance&#13;
&#13;
right, so to speak.&#13;
&#13;
         On the description of the poverty trends, I&#13;
&#13;
think it is a very informative        document, and we like very&#13;
&#13;
much that the International Development Goals are brought&#13;
&#13;
in and measured, and we have these projections.            It&#13;
&#13;
clearly comes out of this, which I think is right, that&#13;
&#13;
Africa is the problem and is the challenge.            As Greg said,&#13;
&#13;
there are problems in meeting the International&#13;
&#13;
Development Goals without special efforts, and clearly we&#13;
&#13;
have to focus these special efforts on Africa.&#13;
&#13;
         I think the report also--as far as the second&#13;
&#13;
point on processes and initiatives is concerned--describes&#13;
&#13;
extensively the initiatives, discussions, thinking going&#13;
&#13;
on in the Bank and how poverty focus of Bank operations&#13;
&#13;
has increased over the past years.          But I tend to feel&#13;
&#13;
that there is probably too much focus on what in the&#13;
&#13;
report is called the "architecture of development" and on&#13;
&#13;
praise of our business models and instruments and all of&#13;
&#13;
the wonderful things that we discuss in the Board and in&#13;
&#13;
the organization.    I think we have to be careful that this&#13;
&#13;
focus on instruments and on architecture does not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     26&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
substitute for a focus, really, on the results on the&#13;
&#13;
ground.&#13;
&#13;
          That leads me to the third point in the report,&#13;
&#13;
namely, this reporting on results and reporting on impact.&#13;
&#13;
Here, it is our sense that the key question of what impact&#13;
&#13;
all of these initiatives have had and will have on poverty&#13;
&#13;
is not squarely addressed.    It is not a new problem.         We&#13;
&#13;
have raised this issue several times in previous years,&#13;
&#13;
and we have had the same discussion on the OED evaluation&#13;
&#13;
of IDA, and how do we really measure the impact of our&#13;
&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
          It is difficult, but I think we really have to&#13;
&#13;
do something about it.   We have to shift the balance a&#13;
&#13;
little bit in these reports so that we do get some more&#13;
&#13;
convincing evidence for the results and the outcome of all&#13;
&#13;
the other initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
          I think the report does give us a number of&#13;
&#13;
examples of poverty impact of Bank-supported interventions&#13;
&#13;
in paragraphs 102 to 116, but I still think we are left&#13;
&#13;
with a sense that these are very nice individual examples,&#13;
&#13;
but what is the overall impact--do these instruments that&#13;
&#13;
we have really work, and how do they work.         So I feel&#13;
&#13;
something is missing here, and I hope that we can&#13;
&#13;

                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      27&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
gradually over the coming years work more in the direction&#13;
&#13;
of strengthening this third part of the progress report.&#13;
&#13;
         We welcome very much what has been said in&#13;
&#13;
paragraph 59 on the alignment of the CASs to the poverty&#13;
&#13;
objectives.   This is very good.      But as is said at the end&#13;
&#13;
of this paragraph also, many CASs still do not devote&#13;
&#13;
enough attention to discussing impact, once again coming&#13;
&#13;
back to the impact.&#13;
&#13;
         We agree that more attention needs to be given&#13;
&#13;
to this part of the CASs and hope that Management will&#13;
&#13;
address this in the future.&#13;
&#13;
         On the role of the SSPs, I must say that we do&#13;
&#13;
not fully agree that poverty reduction has been the key&#13;
&#13;
objective in all recent sector strategy papers.          We have&#13;
&#13;
to do more work to place poverty reduction at the center&#13;
&#13;
stage of our sector and thematic strategies.          I think this&#13;
&#13;
is clearly one of the big challenges that we have now, and&#13;
&#13;
we will soon receive a SSP stock-taking paper.&#13;
&#13;
         Related to what kind of questions this report&#13;
&#13;
really should be answering is, of course, who is&#13;
&#13;
responsible for monitoring progress on poverty.          We&#13;
&#13;
believe that this responsibility has to lie primarily with&#13;
&#13;
the Regions and not with the Poverty Anchor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      28&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
           I think a related question is raised in&#13;
&#13;
paragraph 142 on the role of sector staff in the&#13;
&#13;
preparation of PRSPs, and once again, I think our response&#13;
&#13;
would be that the major responsibility has to be with the&#13;
&#13;
Regions.   I think this is the only way that you really get&#13;
&#13;
it out in the field.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me say that we really find that this year's&#13;
&#13;
report is an improvement over pervious years in that it&#13;
&#13;
does take account of gender in its analysis, and this is&#13;
&#13;
very much welcome.&#13;
&#13;
           Now, if you were going to rewrite or combine the&#13;
&#13;
two reports, we hope that you might also then find a&#13;
&#13;
little more space for references to "engendering&#13;
&#13;
development" which has been given in the text now.&#13;
&#13;
           Now, on a specific point, we have noticed that&#13;
&#13;
the report does recognize the negative effects of&#13;
&#13;
inequality on poverty, but we think it could pay more&#13;
&#13;
attention to distributional aspects of growth.          We notice&#13;
&#13;
that the other report on the operationalization does&#13;
&#13;
address this issue much better, and we welcome these&#13;
&#13;
references to distributional impact.&#13;
&#13;
           There is a reference here on which I have to ask&#13;
&#13;
a question because I don't know what it is, but suddenly,&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
you are introducing a concept--or an instrument,&#13;
&#13;
apparently--called "distributional impact analysis" or&#13;
&#13;
assessment.   I am just wondering, is that something new?&#13;
&#13;
We had the social impact assessment, we have the poverty&#13;
&#13;
impact assessment, and now we are talking about a&#13;
&#13;
distributional impact assessment--or is it just a jargon&#13;
&#13;
that we have to clean up a little bit here.          I am not&#13;
&#13;
quite sure what it means or whether we are suggesting a&#13;
&#13;
new analytical instrument.     I hope it is something that&#13;
&#13;
will be dealt with in the context of the existing&#13;
&#13;
instrument.&#13;
&#13;
         In paragraph 58 in the progress report on&#13;
&#13;
gender, environment, rural development, risk management,&#13;
&#13;
et cetera, I think we have to recognize that this is also&#13;
&#13;
a question of creating the right incentive for Bank staff&#13;
&#13;
to bring up these issues in their dialogue with the&#13;
&#13;
governments, and there needs to be more candor within the&#13;
&#13;
Bank to put these issues higher on the agenda.&#13;
&#13;
         On poverty assessments as such--and here I am&#13;
&#13;
referring particularly to paragraph 64--we have a question&#13;
&#13;
about numbers here.   We have noted that the number of&#13;
&#13;
poverty assessments seems to be declining.          In FY00, it is&#13;
&#13;
said that 17 poverty assessments were delivered, while&#13;
&#13;

                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     30&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
only three assessments have been completed in FY01.         Is&#13;
&#13;
that a coincidence?   I assume there must be some&#13;
&#13;
explanation here, but it does not seem to be consistent&#13;
&#13;
with our renewed emphasis on economic and sector work.&#13;
&#13;
          We commend the good cross-cutting analyses that&#13;
&#13;
have been concluded this year, for instance, the poverty&#13;
&#13;
study in the ECA Region.    We also stress the need for up-&#13;
&#13;
to-date, high-quality participatory country studies on&#13;
&#13;
poverty in general terms.&#13;
&#13;
          In conclusion, on the progress report itself,&#13;
&#13;
let me say that we agree to the conclusions listed in the&#13;
&#13;
"Challenges Ahead" chapter.    I don't think these&#13;
&#13;
conclusions contain any real surprises, but they are a&#13;
&#13;
consolidation of the findings over the past couple of&#13;
&#13;
years, and once again, I think our conclusion on this is&#13;
&#13;
what really matters now is to see the results of this, if&#13;
&#13;
it will work in the field.&#13;
&#13;
          Then, just one or two comments on the&#13;
&#13;
operationalization report.    We find it very useful to get&#13;
&#13;
the overview that is presented in this report and the&#13;
&#13;
ongoing work on revising and producing OPs and BPs and&#13;
&#13;
Sector Strategies in line with the World Development&#13;
&#13;
Report.&#13;

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         We fully agree that empowerment, as has been&#13;
&#13;
said also by OED, probably poses the greatest challenges&#13;
&#13;
for the Bank and the operationalization.          We are here&#13;
&#13;
envisaging to work more with people than with government,&#13;
&#13;
and that will mean   some fundamental changes in the way&#13;
&#13;
that the Bank is doing business.&#13;
&#13;
         I do find that the paper takes a very important&#13;
&#13;
step in outlining in paragraphs 50 to 67 how this new&#13;
&#13;
dimension will be taken into account in the Bank's work,&#13;
&#13;
but I am fully aware of the challenges.           We welcome the&#13;
&#13;
plans to produce a staff guidance paper on empowerment.            I&#13;
&#13;
don't know what the time line is for producing this paper;&#13;
&#13;
that would be useful to know.&#13;
&#13;
         In the context of empowerment, I think one&#13;
&#13;
should also mention that there are probably quite a number&#13;
&#13;
of advantages here for the Bank to work in close&#13;
&#13;
cooperation with the UN agencies and also some bilateral&#13;
&#13;
donors who clearly have much broader experience in this&#13;
&#13;
field.&#13;
&#13;
         Internally, I think it will be important to link&#13;
&#13;
this work to the implementation of the Gender&#13;
&#13;
Mainstreaming Strategy.   When working with empowerment, it&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
will be crucial to recognize the different relative powers&#13;
&#13;
and voice of men and women, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
         On the operational proposal, we welcome the&#13;
&#13;
proposal to streamline reporting to the Board, and hope&#13;
&#13;
that this working group can produce some good results.         We&#13;
&#13;
also agree that we can discontinue the tracking operations&#13;
&#13;
in the program of targeted interventions, and we would&#13;
&#13;
expect that resources that will be freed up from this&#13;
&#13;
discontinuation can be used for mainstreaming poverty&#13;
&#13;
impact monitoring and capacity-building.&#13;
&#13;
         Chairman, let me stop here.        I have further&#13;
&#13;
comments, but I think I will come back later if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:    Thank you, Finn.&#13;
&#13;
         I have Neil Hyden, B.P., and Jan.&#13;
&#13;
         Neil, please.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. HYDEN:     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         I wanted to take up first the relationship&#13;
&#13;
between these papers and the first question for discussion&#13;
&#13;
about are we satisfied with the Bank's approach in&#13;
&#13;
bringing the goals and concepts of the WDR into its&#13;
&#13;
strategic framework, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
         I think we do need to distinguish between the&#13;
&#13;
WDR, the Bank's strategy, Operational Policies, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        33&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
progress reports.    The WDR was a research report.          It did&#13;
&#13;
not have the endorsement of the Board, and as I recall, it&#13;
&#13;
did not have the endorsement of Management.            At least,&#13;
&#13;
that is what the President told us.          It was something in&#13;
&#13;
which the director of the project resigned in the course&#13;
&#13;
of it, because he thought his academic freedom was being&#13;
&#13;
impinged upon, and the Bank was at pains to say that that&#13;
&#13;
was not the case and that this is a research document.&#13;
&#13;
           It is therefore to me a bit strange to be&#13;
&#13;
talking about operationalizing it as though it were policy&#13;
&#13;
or strategy   of the Bank.      I think we do have a Bank&#13;
&#13;
strategy which has more endorsement, and that is in the&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Framework Paper, and it seems to me that the&#13;
&#13;
second paper we have here, "Attacking Poverty," called&#13;
&#13;
"Operationalizing the WDR," is in effect a statement of a&#13;
&#13;
strategy, a setting out of a Bank strategy.            And rather&#13;
&#13;
than calling it an "operationalization of the WDR," which,&#13;
&#13;
apart from being hard to say, I think we should see it&#13;
&#13;
rather more clearly as this is the Bank's approach to its&#13;
&#13;
mission.&#13;
&#13;
           The Strategic Framework Paper was some time ago;&#13;
&#13;
it was tied up with budget issues and so on.            I think that&#13;
&#13;
if we are going to restructure these papers, I would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      34&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
rather see the "Attacking" paper seen as a paper setting&#13;
&#13;
out strategy.   I don't necessarily object to bringing the&#13;
&#13;
two together, but maybe there is value to keeping the&#13;
&#13;
first paper separate as a reporting document rather than&#13;
&#13;
something which tries to blend by the strategy and the&#13;
&#13;
reporting approach in one effort.&#13;
&#13;
         There is, I think, a significant difference in&#13;
&#13;
emphasis between the WDR and the strategy as set out in&#13;
&#13;
the Strategic Framework Paper and in this document, and&#13;
&#13;
that is not surprising; we should expect it given their&#13;
&#13;
different characters.    There is a difference in emphasis&#13;
&#13;
between the International Development Goals and the WDR.&#13;
&#13;
The International Development Goals don't have the&#13;
&#13;
emphasis on empowerment and security, and I guess if we&#13;
&#13;
took the interpretation OED had this morning, that if one&#13;
&#13;
were pursuing the development goals whole-heartedly as one&#13;
&#13;
objective, they would give more weight to growth than the&#13;
&#13;
WDR.&#13;
&#13;
         So I think there is obviously a great deal in&#13;
&#13;
common, but there are differences at the margin in nuance&#13;
&#13;
and emphasis between those, and it is appropriate that in&#13;
&#13;
looking at the Bank strategy, we should be able to bring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       35&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
together a whole range of sources, as Finn was saying, not&#13;
&#13;
just the WDR.&#13;
&#13;
            I think we also have to be conscious that the&#13;
&#13;
Bank strategy will not always be the country strategy, or&#13;
&#13;
the strategy of the governments of the countries that we&#13;
&#13;
deal with.    If the Bank strategy is focused on poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction as a central goal, poverty reduction is only one&#13;
&#13;
of the goals that the governments have to pursue.           They&#13;
&#13;
are concerned with economic growth in its own right, they&#13;
&#13;
are concerned with a whole range of things which either&#13;
&#13;
overlap with poverty reduction or could be quite separate&#13;
&#13;
from it.&#13;
&#13;
            So we will not always have a commonality of&#13;
&#13;
goals.   The purpose of the CDF and PRSP processes that we&#13;
&#13;
have introduced is to allow a sort of marriage, a finding&#13;
&#13;
out of what we can do that fits with the government&#13;
&#13;
strategy and with the government having, in effect, the&#13;
&#13;
ownership and final word.&#13;
&#13;
            So if the strategy is the sort of menu that the&#13;
&#13;
Bank brings to its discussions with countries, then the&#13;
&#13;
outcome of those discussions may be different.&#13;
&#13;
            We then have this question of Operational&#13;
&#13;
Policies.    I guess we have to wait and see what will come&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                     36&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
out of the drafting of those, but Operational Policies are&#13;
&#13;
much more legal directives to staff about how they go&#13;
&#13;
about their tasks, and I would be concerned if our&#13;
&#13;
Operational Policies, as enforced or potentially enforced&#13;
&#13;
by the Inspection Panel, were to be too rigid.         I think&#13;
&#13;
they need to be narrower than the Bank strategy which by&#13;
&#13;
its character has to have a lot more latitude for&#13;
&#13;
identifying broad objectives but then allowing flexibility&#13;
&#13;
as to how they are pursued in individual cases.&#13;
&#13;
         So I think we will need to give a great deal of&#13;
&#13;
attention and care to those Operational Policies.&#13;
&#13;
         I emphasize that there isn't unanimity amongst&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's members as to what our objectives are, what the&#13;
&#13;
weight between, say, environment and poverty reduction is.&#13;
&#13;
I noted that Mr. O'Neill at the Development Committee was&#13;
&#13;
quite forthright in saying he didn't agree that poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction was the overriding objective of the Bank or that&#13;
&#13;
it should be; that we have had various other indications&#13;
&#13;
of a range of views.    I was at a presentation in the&#13;
&#13;
Preston Auditorium earlier this week by Mr. Bellamy,&#13;
&#13;
launching the Bank's Involvement in the Environment Month,&#13;
&#13;
and he referred to a visit he made to Papua, New Guinea,&#13;
&#13;
where he told the residents of Papua, New Guinea that they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      37&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
should not seek to change their lives because they have so&#13;
&#13;
much food and animal and vegetable life and fish swimming&#13;
&#13;
in the sea that it was much better than living in North&#13;
&#13;
America.   He then said, after he had made these comments,&#13;
&#13;
how the local representative of the World Bank rang him up&#13;
&#13;
and told him--indeed, shouted at him--that he couldn't say&#13;
&#13;
such things in public, that he had to realize that these&#13;
&#13;
people were poor and needed to have their poverty reduced.&#13;
&#13;
           The thing that surprised me about this was that&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Bellamy got a standing ovation from the staff of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, who I guess were heavily weighted with our&#13;
&#13;
environmental people.&#13;
&#13;
           But even within the Bank, I think there are some&#13;
&#13;
diversities of view as to just what our objectives are, so&#13;
&#13;
I think we can develop a strategy; I think this paper&#13;
&#13;
should have in mind that we could keep those distinctions&#13;
&#13;
clear.&#13;
&#13;
           On deepening analytical work, I broadly support&#13;
&#13;
the sort of directions indicated, but again would&#13;
&#13;
emphasize the need to tie analytical work to the perceived&#13;
&#13;
needs of individual countries or range of countries.&#13;
&#13;
Obviously, we want to be ahead of the game in thinking&#13;
&#13;
about issues, but we don't want to head off too far in&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
directions where there is no real perceived need at the&#13;
&#13;
country level.&#13;
&#13;
            I know we have a number of countries, including&#13;
&#13;
some of my own, that have quite whole-heartedly gone down&#13;
&#13;
he direction that the Bank is now pursuing, but not all&#13;
&#13;
countries will fall into that category.&#13;
&#13;
            I can leave it there.      Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. STEK:    Thank you for some very challenging&#13;
&#13;
comments.    Perhaps the next colloquium should be about the&#13;
&#13;
mission again--but it was interesting.&#13;
&#13;
            I just want to mention that Richard Kaijuka left&#13;
&#13;
his thoughtful comments in written form on the table in&#13;
&#13;
the back.    I advise everybody to pick that up if they&#13;
&#13;
haven't done so and to read those notes.             They are very&#13;
&#13;
thoughtful.    I don't know if Richard will want to say&#13;
&#13;
something at some point, but they are very readable, and&#13;
&#13;
they read very easily as a matter of fact, while&#13;
&#13;
nonetheless they are very fundamental.           So I advise&#13;
&#13;
reading them.&#13;
&#13;
            B.P.?&#13;
&#13;
            MR. SINGH:   Mr. Chairman, I would like to see&#13;
&#13;
these two documents in the light of one of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        39&#13;

&#13;
International Development Goals, to reduce poverty by half&#13;
&#13;
by the year 2015.&#13;
&#13;
         When I look at these two reports from that&#13;
&#13;
angle, I find that both of the documents are quite rich in&#13;
&#13;
terms of the diversity in terms of analysis.            But it falls&#13;
&#13;
short of implementation goals, and therefore, let me first&#13;
&#13;
list out some of those points before I come to general&#13;
&#13;
observations.&#13;
&#13;
         First, the quality of the progress report will&#13;
&#13;
depend upon the reliability of the data collected in&#13;
&#13;
respect to poverty figures.       And this report rightly&#13;
&#13;
points out that there are a lot of uncertainties about&#13;
&#13;
poverty figures in several of the important countries,&#13;
&#13;
including India and China, which account for 45 percent of&#13;
&#13;
the world's poor.    I think this is something which needs&#13;
&#13;
to be addressed immediately.&#13;
&#13;
         The second point is that in this progress&#13;
&#13;
report, concrete country-specific analyses are missing.&#13;
&#13;
It is also not very clear as to whether the reforms&#13;
&#13;
undertaken by different countries have been able to make a&#13;
&#13;
decisive impact on poverty reduction.           The need is for us&#13;
&#13;
to develop appropriate analytical tools to find out&#13;
&#13;
answers to these questions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      40&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         My next comment is that this report is also not&#13;
&#13;
very clear about the resources required to achieve the&#13;
&#13;
goals; how are the countries raising resources&#13;
&#13;
domestically for poverty reduction goals, because the&#13;
&#13;
national governments are engaged in a number of things,&#13;
&#13;
and the main concern of all ruling elites all over the&#13;
&#13;
world is to remain in power, and some of the money that&#13;
&#13;
they collect is spent on those causes, because that is&#13;
&#13;
quite natural.   But there should be some idea, and there&#13;
&#13;
should be some concern in our reports.&#13;
&#13;
         Next, we have to focus in our reports on certain&#13;
&#13;
countries.   We have here 10 countries, and out of these&#13;
&#13;
10, four are only updates.     I think that if you look at it&#13;
&#13;
from the poverty reduction goals, you have to focus on&#13;
&#13;
East Asia, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, and&#13;
&#13;
therefore, the report has to keep on mentioning these&#13;
&#13;
three Regions.&#13;
&#13;
         Another important consideration--I again commend&#13;
&#13;
the authors of the report for highlighting governance&#13;
&#13;
issues and public sector reforms--but another area where&#13;
&#13;
the report could have been a little more specific is about&#13;
&#13;
the role of the NGOs.    There are many NGOs who have become&#13;
&#13;
very expensive, have become nonproductive, and I am not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      41&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
saying that they need reforms, because of course, they&#13;
&#13;
would need reforms, and that is not the job of the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank.   But I think it should be possible for us to have&#13;
&#13;
some idea as to what extent in a particular country&#13;
&#13;
context NGO activity has supplemented the efforts of the&#13;
&#13;
government in reducing poverty.&#13;
&#13;
          Also--and again, this is in the area of&#13;
&#13;
evolution, according to me--as to how the high-technology-&#13;
&#13;
-and putting some emphasis on the word "high"--by which I&#13;
&#13;
mean information technology and biotechnology--are&#13;
&#13;
contributing to a decrease in poverty reduction.          Of&#13;
&#13;
course, they are contributing to equity--that I know--but&#13;
&#13;
how are they contributing to a decline in poverty?&#13;
&#13;
          The other question is more internal--to what&#13;
&#13;
extent the impact of World Bank projects on poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction is being assessed in a country context.          It is&#13;
&#13;
in that context that I would again like to welcome the&#13;
&#13;
establishment of a working group in the Bank to review the&#13;
&#13;
nature and scope of the poverty assessment reports.            I&#13;
&#13;
think this report will be of great help to us.&#13;
&#13;
          Mr. Chairman, before I go to the WDR&#13;
&#13;
operationalization, I have two more submissions to make.&#13;
&#13;
One is about World Bank lending.       I wanted my colleagues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       42&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
to give me an analysis of what we have done in terms of&#13;
&#13;
lending for the last five years, and the figures speak&#13;
&#13;
something like this.    During the last five years, 1995-&#13;
&#13;
2000, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa Region received&#13;
&#13;
only 12 and 10 percent, respectively, of total World Bank&#13;
&#13;
lending.&#13;
&#13;
            Now, South Asia accounts for 43.5 percent, and&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 25 percent of the world's&#13;
&#13;
poor.   So, combined together, these two Regions, which&#13;
&#13;
have 70 percent of the world's poor, got only 22 percent&#13;
&#13;
of the World Bank's assistance.&#13;
&#13;
            I thought this analysis would allow to the point&#13;
&#13;
Neil was making about our strategic assessment policies.&#13;
&#13;
            The other point which I thought I would&#13;
&#13;
highlight as my second point is how do we reflect the&#13;
&#13;
point that I made earlier, that our lending policies don't&#13;
&#13;
go directly to serve the interests of the ruling elite.&#13;
&#13;
That would depend upon what we do in terms of our lending&#13;
&#13;
arrangements.    There, the idea was that we should go,&#13;
&#13;
besides education and health care in the rural areas, and&#13;
&#13;
our lending to agriculture, irrigation, watershed&#13;
&#13;
projects, rural roads, which have declined, should be&#13;
&#13;
restored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     43&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         This is something--again, the point that Finn&#13;
&#13;
and Matthias made very eloquently--that emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
environment may not always mean poverty reduction.         But I&#13;
&#13;
am not saying that you should look the other way if there&#13;
&#13;
are glaring issues of sustainable development, if you&#13;
&#13;
ignore environmental concerns.     But lending operations&#13;
&#13;
must be sensitive to poverty reduction in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
         The other point--and again, it is in the process&#13;
&#13;
of evolution--is about trade.     The World Bank's thinking&#13;
&#13;
is emerging on this issue as to what kind of trade we&#13;
&#13;
support through our analytical work and also through our&#13;
&#13;
lending dimensions of work,    which goes to reduce poverty.&#13;
&#13;
         Having said this, Mr. Chairman, when I was&#13;
&#13;
looking at the issue of operationalization of the WDR&#13;
&#13;
report, I personally feel that this is a good thing that&#13;
&#13;
we are talking about operationalization of this WDR on&#13;
&#13;
poverty, because the WDR represents in my view a kind of&#13;
&#13;
fusion of ideas between practitioners and theorists, and&#13;
&#13;
to a great extent, this is largely acceptable both to&#13;
&#13;
academia and to the policymakers, and it should be our&#13;
&#13;
objective to go for this.&#13;
&#13;
         Now, I personally support what I have called in&#13;
&#13;
other contexts the "three mantras" that this WDR talks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       44&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
about--poverty, opportunity, empowerment, and security.            I&#13;
&#13;
also see the assessment in the document that countries&#13;
&#13;
with good governance policies have been able to do much&#13;
&#13;
better than countries who have not been really sensitive&#13;
&#13;
to these issues.   I think this is very important, and the&#13;
&#13;
CAS, the PRSP, and the economic and sector work of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank should emphasize that.&#13;
&#13;
         We do believe, and the report highlights, making&#13;
&#13;
economic growth the engine of poverty reduction.           Here,&#13;
&#13;
one sensitivity I think in operationalization is very&#13;
&#13;
necessary--that if we look at the country context, it may&#13;
&#13;
be that if you invest one dollar in China, the money may&#13;
&#13;
go--I am giving a hypothetical figure now--50 cents to the&#13;
&#13;
poor because of certain background, and if you give that&#13;
&#13;
money to another country which has a different background,&#13;
&#13;
the amount of money that may go to the poor may be 10&#13;
&#13;
cents; in some other countries, it may be 5 cents.           You&#13;
&#13;
cannot alter that.    It is not in your hands to alter that.&#13;
&#13;
But as long as you know that, as long as you are sensitive&#13;
&#13;
to these country-specific conditions, you are in a&#13;
&#13;
position to raise right governance policy issues, I think&#13;
&#13;
you are doing your job, we are doing our job.&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      45&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
           I would also like to mention as my last point,&#13;
&#13;
Pieter, that we will have to go for this&#13;
&#13;
operationalization of the WDR largely in the country&#13;
&#13;
context.   The point that was made in respect to monitoring&#13;
&#13;
and reporting to the Board, I support, but we must develop&#13;
&#13;
a monitoring mechanism of this operationalization, and&#13;
&#13;
this has to be a dynamic process; it will vary from&#13;
&#13;
country to country, but it has to be a dynamic process.&#13;
&#13;
The areas have to be identified, and action has to be&#13;
&#13;
location-specific.&#13;
&#13;
           I do always feel that this task is daunting, and&#13;
&#13;
I often quote A. G. Beltz [phonetic], who wrote in a&#13;
&#13;
different context, but it was very powerful.          He said "How&#13;
&#13;
simple it is inside the person, how complex it is in the&#13;
&#13;
outside world."   So we have to make it simple even to the&#13;
&#13;
outside world, and that is the challenge before the&#13;
&#13;
economists and the planners and the administrators.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STEK:    Thank you, B.P.&#13;
&#13;
           Jan?&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           I feel like I have come full circle today.         In&#13;
&#13;
opening, there was reference to the fact that this is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     46&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
seventh annual progress report on poverty, and when I&#13;
&#13;
joined the Bank, at one of the first meetings, we heard&#13;
&#13;
Evelyn Herfkens eloquently assert that what we value, what&#13;
&#13;
we place our emphasis on, is reflected in what we choose&#13;
&#13;
to talk about; and the fact that we did not systematically&#13;
&#13;
talk about the effects of our work on poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
was not sending the right incentives throughout the&#13;
&#13;
organization as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
         So it is very good to come full circle today and&#13;
&#13;
hear us engaged, and engaged in a way that I think&#13;
&#13;
reflects the real priority of the Board as well as among&#13;
&#13;
Management on these issues.    It is tremendous progress,&#13;
&#13;
and it is very important.&#13;
&#13;
         I should start with a clarification, because&#13;
&#13;
there was a reference to Secretary O'Neill.         I think it&#13;
&#13;
has to be understood that the Secretary of the Treasury&#13;
&#13;
and indeed this administration do not disagree at all with&#13;
&#13;
the importance of poverty reduction.       The point that he&#13;
&#13;
was trying to make was simply that if we don't emphasize&#13;
&#13;
or if we lose sight of the link between achieving growth&#13;
&#13;
and poverty reduction, then we are holding out false hope.&#13;
&#13;
So it is easy to misinterpret or to selectively emphasize&#13;
&#13;
that which appears to be a departure.        But I do want to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     47&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
clarify that, because his particular focus is on&#13;
&#13;
productivity, on growth, and on how this relates to&#13;
&#13;
poverty reduction.   So I don't think we have a change in&#13;
&#13;
focus here.&#13;
&#13;
         I hope that the opening statements might be&#13;
&#13;
circulated, because I thought they were both very&#13;
&#13;
thoughtful and very useful.    In particular, I think Greg's&#13;
&#13;
points on monitoring and evaluation and resource needs are&#13;
&#13;
quite important to frame the Board's discussion next week.&#13;
&#13;
         I also hope that the President will chair that&#13;
&#13;
Board discussion, because I think that there, too, this is&#13;
&#13;
something that is central to our work, and particularly&#13;
&#13;
because--and Neil Hyden referred to this--of the&#13;
&#13;
controversy around the World Development Report, I think&#13;
&#13;
it is very important to make quite clear that the focus on&#13;
&#13;
poverty and a strategy is something on which we all agree.&#13;
&#13;
         I think that debate is healthy, and there is&#13;
&#13;
plenty of room to debate, but I think we have indeed come&#13;
&#13;
a distance since the issue of that WDR, and I think it&#13;
&#13;
does reflect a policy agreement.      Yes, it is a research&#13;
&#13;
report, and that is quite important because that means it&#13;
&#13;
is independent--it should be--but historically, there is a&#13;
&#13;
very close link between WDRs and our work program and how&#13;
&#13;

                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      48&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
we move forward, and I think that that link is being&#13;
&#13;
established here through these two reports.&#13;
&#13;
          So I think that at that Board meeting, one of&#13;
&#13;
the most important things it needs to do in fact is to&#13;
&#13;
establish the degree of consensus and priorities that we&#13;
&#13;
adopt as an organization in partnership with others going&#13;
&#13;
forward, because our effectiveness depends on our clarity&#13;
&#13;
and our priority-setting, and I think that that should be&#13;
&#13;
a pretty ambitious goal, but I think it should be the&#13;
&#13;
focus of next week's Board meeting.&#13;
&#13;
          I want to pick up one other general point before&#13;
&#13;
I turn to my specific points, and it is a point that&#13;
&#13;
Matthias Meyer opened with and others have reflected as&#13;
&#13;
well.   I think one of the most important additional steps&#13;
&#13;
that these reports need to take is to translate the&#13;
&#13;
findings into more timebound plans.        I think there is a&#13;
&#13;
danger here that it can become diffuse because so many&#13;
&#13;
interrelated elements are important; but unless we can&#13;
&#13;
really determine what will be done by whom, by when, there&#13;
&#13;
is a risk that our work program doesn't in fact reflect&#13;
&#13;
the priorities that these reports are underscoring.          There&#13;
&#13;
is just no accountability absent time lines, and in that&#13;
&#13;
regard, Table 1 on page 46 of "Operationalizing the WDR"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        49&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
is too vague.    Time lines link budgets, and they are the&#13;
&#13;
only instrument the Board has to take stock and say are we&#13;
&#13;
on track.&#13;
&#13;
            I think that when you look at Table 1, that is&#13;
&#13;
an enormously ambitious schedule, and I don't think we&#13;
&#13;
will probably reach it in exactly that way, and I think&#13;
&#13;
that's okay; but when we set out some goals, then we can&#13;
&#13;
monitor our follow-through, and we can also assure that&#13;
&#13;
the resources are allocated to assure implementation.            I&#13;
&#13;
stress this because this has been a consistent theme in&#13;
&#13;
looking at our experience to date with the sector&#13;
&#13;
strategies.    We talk about the strategies in an&#13;
&#13;
overarching way--a year later, when we revisit, we find&#13;
&#13;
that because the strategies were not specific or related&#13;
&#13;
to resources at that stage, the Board agrees to or&#13;
&#13;
endorses a strategy, but we don't in fact at the same time&#13;
&#13;
commit ourselves to the implementation.             So I think that&#13;
&#13;
that is the one area that I would we could between now and&#13;
&#13;
the Board meeting be somewhat more specific about what the&#13;
&#13;
goals are.&#13;
&#13;
            Now, to turn to specific points, I have seven of&#13;
&#13;
them.   First, on monitoring--and I can be brief here,&#13;
&#13;
because this point has already been made, and I think&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     50&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
there is unanimity among Directors on this, and it is&#13;
&#13;
indeed candidly acknowledged in the reports themselves--&#13;
&#13;
the biggest hole to us in our poverty reduction work&#13;
&#13;
really does lie in the extent to which we are effectively&#13;
&#13;
monitoring results.   There seem to be really two problems&#13;
&#13;
here--that there is too little infrastructure in place to&#13;
&#13;
track what countries are actually, for example, buying&#13;
&#13;
with debt relief; and it is unclear what poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
monitoring responsibilities local governments, both&#13;
&#13;
national and municipal, can handle.       We appear to be&#13;
&#13;
contemplating a somewhat supply-driven approach, and that&#13;
&#13;
is not known to engender very high adoption rates.         I&#13;
&#13;
think there is a real political down side that we need to&#13;
&#13;
think about in the context of the PRSPs, which is if local&#13;
&#13;
civil society and others lose faith in the program because&#13;
&#13;
there aren't reliable results to report, then a process&#13;
&#13;
which is opening with so much promise, the poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction strategies and attempting to build broader local&#13;
&#13;
knowledge of them and participation in their development,&#13;
&#13;
could backfire on us.&#13;
&#13;
         The progress report uses the word "indications"&#13;
&#13;
in paragraph 54 to describe what it knows about how debt&#13;
&#13;
relief is being invested by countries.        I think that,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     51&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
really, "indications" is not enough, that we ought to&#13;
&#13;
amplify this, indicating specific steps being taken to put&#13;
&#13;
monitoring systems in place, and that is a resource issue-&#13;
&#13;
-it is a serious resource issue--and we really have to&#13;
&#13;
follow through here.&#13;
&#13;
         The question that that raises is the kind of&#13;
&#13;
recurrent cost burden that we are proposing to place on&#13;
&#13;
local administrations when we talk about this.         This is&#13;
&#13;
not an easy set of issues, but I do think that monitoring&#13;
&#13;
and evaluation is an area that we have got to succeed at&#13;
&#13;
coming up with some viable, pragmatic means of tracking&#13;
&#13;
ourselves going forward.&#13;
&#13;
         My second point relates to a sense we had in&#13;
&#13;
reading the report--and I think Finn Jonck has already&#13;
&#13;
raised this--about a certain inward focus.         I understand&#13;
&#13;
that, because what we are doing here is reporting on our&#13;
&#13;
own progress, so a certain amount of this is inevitable.&#13;
&#13;
But as Finn Jonck said, I think the focus on architecture&#13;
&#13;
doesn't substitute for really keeping our focus on results&#13;
&#13;
on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
         In this regard, I think we do need to talk more&#13;
&#13;
about donor partnership and increased capacity&#13;
&#13;
development, and I would like us to talk more explicitly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       52&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
about how we plan to involve local researchers as well as&#13;
&#13;
donor experts in the sort of "thinking out" phase that we&#13;
&#13;
are talking about here and saying we need to learn more&#13;
&#13;
about the dynamics of poverty in particular places.&#13;
&#13;
            The creation of the Global Development Network&#13;
&#13;
in fact, I would say, commits us to both building&#13;
&#13;
capacity, local research capacity, and using that&#13;
&#13;
capacity.    So I would think it would be entirely logical&#13;
&#13;
and appropriate in our discussing, for example, of&#13;
&#13;
operationalizing the WDR, to say how specifically we are&#13;
&#13;
going to involve local researchers in terms of being able&#13;
&#13;
to undertake the kind of baseline data where there are&#13;
&#13;
tremendous gaps in our knowledge.        That would seem a&#13;
&#13;
pragmatic partnership that we could really say we're going&#13;
&#13;
to do it; we're going to see how we can identify and equip&#13;
&#13;
local researchers to be undertaking that data and&#13;
&#13;
monitoring change over time.       It would make concrete our&#13;
&#13;
sort of general, overall commitment to building those&#13;
&#13;
partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
            I agree in that regard with Mr. Kaijuka's stress&#13;
&#13;
on in-country capacity-building to conduct independent&#13;
&#13;
surveys, and I think this is where the Global Development&#13;
&#13;
Network could use that network to actually make this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       53&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
happen in a set of countries.       I just think that our&#13;
&#13;
research, our indicators, our monitoring system will all&#13;
&#13;
be more effective of local researchers and donor experts&#13;
&#13;
are involved in the agenda-setting and in the actual&#13;
&#13;
research.    So I would hope we could hear more and commit&#13;
&#13;
ourselves more specifically to that.&#13;
&#13;
            My third point relates to the kind of struggle&#13;
&#13;
that we had in looking--and I know how difficult it is;&#13;
&#13;
you are trying to report to us on progress across a whole&#13;
&#13;
range of very different countries in which the Bank works-&#13;
&#13;
-but I think the final report does come across a little&#13;
&#13;
bit too much in terms of more kind of a sense that there&#13;
&#13;
is a general approach.     We really know that countries&#13;
&#13;
differ quite dramatically in the strategies they pursue,&#13;
&#13;
the level of political consensus around market economies,&#13;
&#13;
the geography, the causes of poverty.          So I think that our&#13;
&#13;
discussion about business models and results has to&#13;
&#13;
acknowledge these differences more explicitly than it does&#13;
&#13;
here.&#13;
&#13;
            Just one example of that would be Mr. Kaijuka's&#13;
&#13;
point about population growth and poverty, which I very&#13;
&#13;
much agree with.    In some countries, that is an overriding&#13;
&#13;
consideration.    If you look at the demographics, it jumps&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       54&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
out at you.   In other countries, that is not the case.&#13;
&#13;
But we are saying very little about that.          So I think we&#13;
&#13;
really have to strive to get to an analysis that&#13;
&#13;
recognizes the particular differences, and I think as well&#13;
&#13;
that flexibility has to be a key design parameter in&#13;
&#13;
putting the monitoring toolkits that are being discussed&#13;
&#13;
together, and there, I would simply repeat--and this is&#13;
&#13;
something Richard Kaijuka also said--the greatest&#13;
&#13;
challenge for the Bank is to help client countries build&#13;
&#13;
capacity.   I don't think that can be said often enough.           I&#13;
&#13;
felt in the two reports an insufficient acknowledgement of&#13;
&#13;
the differences across country and the need to tailor&#13;
&#13;
approaches and devise country-specific strategies, and&#13;
&#13;
country-specific strategies in the context of regional&#13;
&#13;
conditions and characteristics. One thing that has been&#13;
&#13;
talked about a lot in the Board in the last year is that,&#13;
&#13;
curiously, we really focus on the country as a unit of&#13;
&#13;
account--we have moved in a way from the project level to&#13;
&#13;
the country level--at the same time, we are still thinking&#13;
&#13;
as an organization how to effectively put in place a&#13;
&#13;
regional focus since we don't have lending instruments&#13;
&#13;
across country boundaries, but we know more and more that&#13;
&#13;
what we are doing in a given country is embedded in a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        55&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
regional context.    So that is an area that I think we have&#13;
&#13;
to acknowledge a little further.&#13;
&#13;
         Fourth, agriculture.         I agree, and the reports&#13;
&#13;
do document progress that has been made in&#13;
&#13;
institutionalizing poverty reduction across the Bank.            But&#13;
&#13;
I want to point out in the very important area of&#13;
&#13;
agriculture that lending here--and this is by all accounts&#13;
&#13;
a critical component of poverty reduction given that the&#13;
&#13;
majority of the poor live in rural areas--is down to 9&#13;
&#13;
percent of total lending.       So it is a little hard to&#13;
&#13;
square our progress on the one hand with perspectives from&#13;
&#13;
other quarters.   And I am using here agriculture as an&#13;
&#13;
important area in itself but also as an example--how do&#13;
&#13;
you reconcile this given the special role that the&#13;
&#13;
agriculture sector plays in the development process?            And&#13;
&#13;
I wonder what, beyond the revision of the Rural Strategy,&#13;
&#13;
which I know is under way, can we look to to ensure that&#13;
&#13;
that is brought in more effectively.&#13;
&#13;
         I think this is particularly important given&#13;
&#13;
that one of the very first sector strategies that the&#13;
&#13;
Board discussed was a Rural Development Strategy "From&#13;
&#13;
Vision to Action," and yet the follow-through didn't&#13;
&#13;
happen, and I don't know if that was partly because we did&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       56&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
not resource the implementation fully enough, or we&#13;
&#13;
weren't working in partnership across--it wasn't build in&#13;
&#13;
enough partnership with the Regions.         I don't honestly&#13;
&#13;
know the answer, but it is very clear that we do need to&#13;
&#13;
understand that if we are going to be effective overall.&#13;
&#13;
            A fifth point--our partnership with donors.         The&#13;
&#13;
Bank is working more and more on partnerships; it is an&#13;
&#13;
area where I think we have to be very impressed with our&#13;
&#13;
progress.    But I think we need to say more about that in&#13;
&#13;
these two reports, and I would just like to hear a little&#13;
&#13;
more to the extent that Management might want to comment&#13;
&#13;
on whether anything came up in doing these reports about&#13;
&#13;
the extent to which the donor coordination framework we&#13;
&#13;
have worked with for a while and are now adapting in the&#13;
&#13;
CDF environment--is this accommodating the very different&#13;
&#13;
kinds of priorities and requirements that different&#13;
&#13;
bilateral donors and the multilateral donors bring to the&#13;
&#13;
table, because I think sometimes we find that we get in&#13;
&#13;
our own way in terms of supporting a country in poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction if different donors have different perspectives.&#13;
&#13;
So I wonder if there is any more than is reflected in the&#13;
&#13;
reports that you might say on that topic.&#13;

&#13;
          Sixth is a comment that I guess I might say&#13;
&#13;
relates to a wholesale/retail approach.            Matthias raised&#13;
&#13;
the question of community-driven development.            I agree&#13;
&#13;
with him that it would be useful for us to have a&#13;
&#13;
discussion specifically on this, because we haven't ever&#13;
&#13;
explicitly talked about it, and yet it is referred to as&#13;
&#13;
an increasing emphasis in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
          Yet we as an institution are not well-organized,&#13;
&#13;
and I am not sure that we can be or should be, to reach&#13;
&#13;
down to the community level.      We are a wholesale Bank in&#13;
&#13;
terms of the magnitude of our operations.&#13;
&#13;
          Some interesting developments have occurred with&#13;
&#13;
respect to working through intermediaries--the IFC most&#13;
&#13;
recently, for example, created actual formal partnerships&#13;
&#13;
with organizations in the micro finance field, because&#13;
&#13;
they can get to the retail institutions, and the IFC&#13;
&#13;
cannot.   But I wonder if we are emphasizing community-&#13;
&#13;
driven development more, and those are small transactions&#13;
&#13;
in terms of financing, certainly the whole HIV/AIDS&#13;
&#13;
strategy for Africa envisions working at the community&#13;
&#13;
level--but that is not how the Bank is structured.           What&#13;
&#13;
are the implications of that for our effectiveness in&#13;
&#13;
poverty reduction if we know that what really occurs is at&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
a community level, and yet we are better-positioned to&#13;
&#13;
interact at the governmental level.          What are the&#13;
&#13;
implications of that.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, a seventh point is implementation and&#13;
&#13;
resources.   Authority and responsibility tend to get&#13;
&#13;
somewhat disconnected in the Bank, so I think we have to&#13;
&#13;
strive for clarity on who is responsible for monitoring&#13;
&#13;
progress and how.    How will we embed a focus on poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction and collaboration, because the report does bring&#13;
&#13;
out that this is key; we have got to be able to work&#13;
&#13;
across the sectors and the countries and the regional vice&#13;
&#13;
presidencies.&#13;
&#13;
           But how are we going to embed that focus in the&#13;
&#13;
incentive systems, in evaluations, in consideration for&#13;
&#13;
promotion?   Here, I would like to quote what Mr. Kaijuka&#13;
&#13;
said on page 8 of his statement, because I think it is so&#13;
&#13;
central.   He said; "It is at the level of specific Bank&#13;
&#13;
teams and individual staff that the Bank will make a&#13;
&#13;
difference in accomplishing its mission.             Efforts to&#13;
&#13;
address the problems of skill mix, behavior, and&#13;
&#13;
motivation of staff are crucial.         The issue of humility in&#13;
&#13;
our dealings with clients cannot be overemphasized."&#13;

&#13;
         I just want to put that in capital letters&#13;
&#13;
because I think it really does underlie all of the&#13;
&#13;
analysis in the reports.    And I am concerned about the&#13;
&#13;
implementation.   I note, for example, that we have talked&#13;
&#13;
about social development, and that is very critical in&#13;
&#13;
poverty reduction, and yet work on the Social Development&#13;
&#13;
Sector Strategy is suspended.      I just really wonder how&#13;
&#13;
that is compatible with driving forward on poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction.&#13;
&#13;
         I think, as Finn Jonck said, it is critical to&#13;
&#13;
link in what we have learned through the Gender&#13;
&#13;
Mainstreaming Strategy recommendations that it has got to&#13;
&#13;
be mandatory that baseline analysis on gender is part of&#13;
&#13;
the country diagnostics, and that linkage is very clear.&#13;

         MR. CHEN:    Thank you, Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
         I would like to thank staff for these well-&#13;
&#13;
written papers.   I found that many points, like quality of&#13;
&#13;
growth and inequality and some others, are very&#13;
&#13;
informative and enlightened, and I think these two papers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
will certainly help my country in formulating its own&#13;
&#13;
poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
         Having said that, I have three points to make.&#13;
&#13;
First, I would like to share Mr. Neil Hyden's view that&#13;
&#13;
the Bank should have a broad poverty reduction strategy,&#13;
&#13;
while at the country level, we should allow each country,&#13;
&#13;
each borrower, to work with the Bank to work out their&#13;
&#13;
specific arrangement on poverty reduction, because it is&#13;
&#13;
impossible for the Bank to work out a strategy that covers&#13;
&#13;
each country's specific situation.&#13;
&#13;
         So I think we have to bear in mind that we&#13;
&#13;
cannot impose the idea of one size for all.           If we have a&#13;
&#13;
very detailed strategy, then we might run the risk of&#13;
&#13;
imposing the Bank's thinking on member countries which may&#13;
&#13;
not be--the idea might not work quite as well in&#13;
&#13;
individual countries.&#13;
&#13;
         Second, I can support most of the analytical&#13;
&#13;
work proposed in the papers.       However, I feel by reading&#13;
&#13;
these two papers that the Bank's future studies and&#13;
&#13;
operations will give more emphasis to addressing the issue&#13;
&#13;
of distribution.   I understand that the poor may not be&#13;
&#13;
able to benefit from growth if a good distribution system&#13;
&#13;
is not in place, but I think that economic growth will at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        61&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
least make distribution system reforms easier.            Without&#13;
&#13;
economic growth, we can hardly see a smooth reform in the&#13;
&#13;
distribution system.     Experience shows that the poor are&#13;
&#13;
often the hardest hit by any reforms if there is no&#13;
&#13;
economic growth followed.       So I believe that growth and&#13;
&#13;
distribution are long-term issues and deserve our long-&#13;
&#13;
term commitment.    I think we may have a balanced view in&#13;
&#13;
these two papers.&#13;
&#13;
         Third, on empowerment, I think I can go along&#13;
&#13;
with the proposal to incorporate the concept into the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's Strategic Framework if the empowerment is defined&#13;
&#13;
as investing more in poor people and strengthening&#13;
&#13;
institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
         However, I do have a question and concern.             If&#13;
&#13;
empowerment means enhancing inclusion of all groups and&#13;
&#13;
making the voices of the poor heard, the idea sounds good,&#13;
&#13;
but the question is how do we operationalize the idea, and&#13;
&#13;
what consequences might there be, because we all recognize&#13;
&#13;
the importance of the voices of the poor being heard, and&#13;
&#13;
their legitimate concerns should be addressed during the&#13;
&#13;
course of poverty reduction, but I doubt the efficiency&#13;
&#13;
and effectiveness of empowerment of this kind.            I wonder&#13;
&#13;
if such empowerment may simply generate numerous different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        62&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
interest groups, prolonging the decisionmaking process, if&#13;
&#13;
different interests are not presented in an orderly way.&#13;
&#13;
And finally, I think the interests of the poorest will be&#13;
&#13;
badly influenced.&#13;
&#13;
         So I wonder if Management could give us more&#13;
&#13;
explanation on the Bank's involvement in empowerment, and&#13;
&#13;
what is the clear definition of empowerment.&#13;
&#13;
         Paragraph 50 on page 21 of the "Attacking&#13;
&#13;
Poverty" paper indicates that empowerment poses the&#13;
&#13;
biggest challenge for the Bank, both in terms of defining&#13;
&#13;
what it means and in the operational context.            I think&#13;
&#13;
that if that is the case, it is too early to bring this&#13;
&#13;
concept of WDR into the Bank's sector strategy business&#13;
&#13;
models and operational policies.&#13;

         I have to say first that for me this is a very&#13;
&#13;
interesting paper, and I thank Management for it and for&#13;
&#13;
the opportunity to discuss it.&#13;
&#13;
         Most important, I think this paper really sets&#13;
&#13;
out how to put our strategy into operational terms--a very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                      63&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
hard word to say, "operationalization"--but it is still&#13;
&#13;
our strategy, and it shows how far we still have to go on&#13;
&#13;
that road.&#13;
&#13;
         I was glad, first, to see that these are called&#13;
&#13;
"emerging business models," because that is what they are&#13;
&#13;
not; they are just emerging.      And trying to go down and&#13;
&#13;
put our poverty work into operational terms is going to be&#13;
&#13;
a long road, and we are going to have to persist in making&#13;
&#13;
it better and better.&#13;
&#13;
         The first point I see on these emerging business&#13;
&#13;
models is how to make the huge amount of analytical work&#13;
&#13;
that we are supposed to do--how to have enough budget to&#13;
&#13;
do it, because throughout the whole paper, you are talking&#13;
&#13;
about analytical work not only for the PRSPs and for the&#13;
&#13;
CASs, but also obviously for monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
We are not going to be able to have any monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
evaluation unless we really have good analysis.&#13;
&#13;
         There is a discussion of the role of the WBI,&#13;
&#13;
and there is talk more than a discussion of partners, of&#13;
&#13;
local partners.   I think that this link between what the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank can do, what partners can do, and then you get&#13;
&#13;
into a discussion of how do you choose those partners,&#13;
&#13;
which obviously is another problem in the countries, but&#13;
&#13;

                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     64&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
we are going to have to go in that direction.         There are&#13;
&#13;
already a few roadways in some countries that are going to&#13;
&#13;
be very interesting to follow.     But definitely, if we are&#13;
&#13;
going to accomplish the amount of economic and sector work&#13;
&#13;
that we need to do, we are going to have to highlight more&#13;
&#13;
that division of work.   We are going to have to do that,&#13;
&#13;
because I think that is basically the main difficulty, and&#13;
&#13;
obviously, in a few years, we will look back and say we&#13;
&#13;
didn't have enough analysis, we didn't have enough&#13;
&#13;
economic and sector work, so we couldn't really develop&#13;
&#13;
these business models.&#13;
&#13;
         In terms of the middle-income country business&#13;
&#13;
model, I think the paper puts very well the point of&#13;
&#13;
reducing vulnerability and avoiding crisis.         I think that&#13;
&#13;
what is still missing in the middle-income countries is&#13;
&#13;
the point of helping countries to deal with volatility.&#13;
&#13;
It is not only a matter of reducing vulnerability and&#13;
&#13;
avoiding crisis, but also, I think the Bank is playing and&#13;
&#13;
should continue to play a very important role in helping&#13;
&#13;
countries deal with that volatility.&#13;
&#13;
         The paper also goes, interestingly, into the&#13;
&#13;
global scene, where the Bank can really make a difference&#13;
&#13;
and where it is becoming more selective, and especially--I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
think it is important--trade, improved governance, and&#13;
&#13;
communicable diseases.&#13;
&#13;
         On the three areas of opportunity, empowerment,&#13;
&#13;
and security, I have three points.       First, on opportunity,&#13;
&#13;
we have noticed that capital flows are very selective--&#13;
&#13;
they go to about 10 countries.     So the analytical role of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank in what are the impediments for a full&#13;
&#13;
participation of the poor in economic activities, I think&#13;
&#13;
is very important.   I think we have relied a lot on macro&#13;
&#13;
strategies, but there hasn't been enough work         on these&#13;
&#13;
economic impediments, which are obviously country-&#13;
&#13;
specific, but I think the country-specific and the&#13;
&#13;
differences between countries are acknowledged in the&#13;
&#13;
business models themselves.    I really believe that the&#13;
&#13;
differences are there.   When you are talking about PRSPs,&#13;
&#13;
the business model itself acknowledges those differences.&#13;
&#13;
I think that would be an interesting path to follow.&#13;
&#13;
         In terms of empowerment, I think we have a huge&#13;
&#13;
challenge, and I also would like to highlight Point 7 on&#13;
&#13;
page 3 of Richard's statement, where he says that "We&#13;
&#13;
believe that any final decision on what should be&#13;
&#13;
prioritized in the document should be based on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       66&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
principle of consensus, and this will require the thorough&#13;
&#13;
judgment by governments."&#13;
&#13;
            Every time we discuss a PRSP here, every time we&#13;
&#13;
discuss a CAS, and every time we discuss how the community&#13;
&#13;
gets involved, I am beginning to see a bigger trend of&#13;
&#13;
NGOs coming to Board Directors to say, "I wasn't&#13;
&#13;
included."    We saw it a little bit in Bolivia, and&#13;
&#13;
obviously, this empowerment is very good, but it is also&#13;
&#13;
going to have that--when is that going to become a&#13;
&#13;
reputational risk for the Bank?        This is a huge area which&#13;
&#13;
we are just getting into, and it is going to be very, very&#13;
&#13;
difficult to handle.&#13;
&#13;
            I want to make a final point in terms of&#13;
&#13;
security.    I find that DEC in the Bank has been involved&#13;
&#13;
in a very interesting analysis of conflicts and the&#13;
&#13;
economic causes of civil conflicts.         Bringing out a place&#13;
&#13;
where the Bank can really work--I understand the&#13;
&#13;
difficulties of the Bank getting involved in conflict;&#13;
&#13;
however, if it doesn't get involved in conflict, there are&#13;
&#13;
many countries where poverty is related to conflict--so I&#13;
&#13;
see that analysis and that work being done at DEC on the&#13;
&#13;
economic causes of civil conflict very, very interesting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

this paper.&#13;
&#13;
         Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:   Thank you, Jaime.&#13;

         Richard?&#13;
&#13;
         MR. KAIJUKA:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
         As you have already informed colleagues, as a&#13;
&#13;
member of the Committee, I have circulated a paper, and I&#13;
&#13;
thought it would be time-wasting to begin to read that&#13;
&#13;
document again.   So with your permission, rather than even&#13;
&#13;
highlight the points--because most contributors have&#13;
&#13;
already alluded to or talked about the issues I raised--I&#13;
&#13;
thought I would use my perhaps even partial experience in&#13;
&#13;
dealing with poverty to underscore the gigantic exercise&#13;
&#13;
that I think the Bank's mission has set itself on.&#13;
&#13;
         In my own view, it is a job where the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
must ask itself, will the World Bank succeed in its&#13;
&#13;
leadership role by making sure that by 2015, the&#13;
&#13;
international community can live up to our expectations,&#13;
&#13;
i.e., shall we really halve poverty or not.&#13;
&#13;
         It is true--much progress has been made, and the&#13;
&#13;
analytical work does point out an excellent contribution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      68&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
made--but it is also worrisome that despite these efforts,&#13;
&#13;
we may not reach that target.&#13;
&#13;
          Why?   If we are to achieve those targets with&#13;
&#13;
World Bank leadership, how do we get there?          That is&#13;
&#13;
really the question that I would like answered, if&#13;
&#13;
possible, with time frame benchmarks.         I see that being&#13;
&#13;
left up in the air, subject to waiting for reports.            That&#13;
&#13;
is one.&#13;
&#13;
          Two, it is not going to be easy to deal with&#13;
&#13;
poverty in all areas, in all Regions in the world--in low-&#13;
&#13;
income countries, middle-income, and even in developed&#13;
&#13;
countries.   But I am assuming that poverty in developed&#13;
&#13;
countries is a function of choice--in other words, it is&#13;
&#13;
not that the resources are lacking, it becomes a&#13;
&#13;
distributional question of income and so on.          So perhaps&#13;
&#13;
that is why the World Bank doesn't engage in those issues.&#13;
&#13;
          But in middle-income countries, my view is that&#13;
&#13;
in some of them, indeed, it remains a governance issue and&#13;
&#13;
a choice of policies.    If those were engaged, maybe&#13;
&#13;
poverty would not be a problem at the end of the day.&#13;
&#13;
          When I come to the middle-income countries, I&#13;
&#13;
want to underscore three points as far as the lower-&#13;
&#13;
income, particularly Africa, which remains a problem.           If&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     69&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
I were to put the number one reason for why there is a&#13;
&#13;
problem of not dealing with poverty, it is governance,&#13;
&#13;
governance, governance.&#13;
&#13;
         To what extent does the World Bank engage in&#13;
&#13;
governance issues?   It seems to me that it is peripheral&#13;
&#13;
in nature, and yet it shouldn't be, in my view.         I can&#13;
&#13;
assure you--I want to agree with Mr. Ruiz--that if one&#13;
&#13;
doesn't address the issue, where do you have conflicts?&#13;
&#13;
You wait for conflicts, and the international community&#13;
&#13;
comes in with post-conflict, with the Red Cross, with the&#13;
&#13;
World Food Program, when in fact one should engage more&#13;
&#13;
time preventing those sustainably.       That, it seems to me,&#13;
&#13;
is an area that is missing.&#13;
&#13;
         So that where you have political commitment at&#13;
&#13;
the top to reform and really good governance, it is proven&#13;
&#13;
that you can reduce poverty in less than two decades,&#13;
&#13;
especially if you look at it from a holistic and regional&#13;
&#13;
angle.&#13;
&#13;
         That brings me--I am really speaking my mind,&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Chairman, and please permit me to give my experience.&#13;
&#13;
The other area where we could make a difference is in&#13;
&#13;
helping countries to focus regionally.        Some of them are&#13;
&#13;
just too tiny to be viable.    You just remain wasting time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     70&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
Whilst if there is a regional focus, in my view, it would&#13;
&#13;
make a lot of difference.&#13;
&#13;
         Once you have done that, and you have a time&#13;
&#13;
frame, and the whole region engages and says the&#13;
&#13;
infrastructure will be there, we help capital flows, we&#13;
&#13;
assist the private sector over a period--and it is not the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank alone; it takes leadership to bring partners--&#13;
&#13;
and then, you have this holistic, comprehensive overview&#13;
&#13;
of dealing with poverty within a time frame.         I can assure&#13;
&#13;
you it can be done.&#13;
&#13;
         But it would appear to me that [inaudible], we&#13;
&#13;
should have progress reports, and 10 years from now, we&#13;
&#13;
will be having the same reports.      I thought I should&#13;
&#13;
underscore that point.&#13;
&#13;
         Next, I want to agree with people who have&#13;
&#13;
commented upon the focus on rural development.         I can&#13;
&#13;
assure you there is no way the Bank's mission can deal&#13;
&#13;
with poverty, and we are not having a special program on&#13;
&#13;
rural development.    That is a contradiction to me, as far&#13;
&#13;
as I am concerned.    And of course, rural development, you&#13;
&#13;
are talking about agriculture.     To the extent that you see&#13;
&#13;
lending flows coming downward, it cannot reflect--there is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     71&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
a contradiction in my view.    This really has to be&#13;
&#13;
reversed as far as I am concerned.&#13;
&#13;
          To the extent that we are going to promote&#13;
&#13;
rural development, promote private sector, and so on, we&#13;
&#13;
should even be thinking in terms of some blending of&#13;
&#13;
instruments. I don't see why we cannot put, for example,&#13;
&#13;
IDA resources in private instead of just always giving IDA&#13;
&#13;
resources to governments, if it were possible.&#13;
&#13;
          I am just thinking innovatively.         These are not&#13;
&#13;
contained in my notes.   As you realize, I am just speaking&#13;
&#13;
my mind on poverty as I understand it, particularly in&#13;
&#13;
Africa.&#13;
&#13;
          The other point I wanted to highlight, which is&#13;
&#13;
in my paper in paragraph 12, is that we have a problem of&#13;
&#13;
population and big families.     The trouble with a poor&#13;
&#13;
person is that he has no opportunity to spend on other&#13;
&#13;
amenities, sports, so he stays with his family.         The&#13;
&#13;
consequences are obvious.&#13;
&#13;
          So for me, it is a question of genuine&#13;
&#13;
engagement on how one educates these families to know that&#13;
&#13;
this is not sustainable.    We are perpetuating poverty,&#13;
&#13;
because you [inaudible] improve the situation, and you&#13;
&#13;
have improved more opportunities for more children.           So I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       72&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
really think that these are areas that we have not focused&#13;
&#13;
on genuinely, globally, so that we can deal with them.&#13;
&#13;
         The other area I want to emphasize in my&#13;
&#13;
submission, I think Jan has mentioned, and that is&#13;
&#13;
capacity-building and institution-building in these&#13;
&#13;
countries.    In fact, in the chairman's Issues Note, in the&#13;
&#13;
last point, he is saying "Management proposes to&#13;
&#13;
discontinue tracking the program of targeted&#13;
&#13;
interventions," and so on.      That is all very well, but in&#13;
&#13;
my view, one needs to have built-in mechanisms at the&#13;
&#13;
country level where you have not only machinery for&#13;
&#13;
tracking but for monitoring and evaluation so that you&#13;
&#13;
don't depend all the time on your own work, because at the&#13;
&#13;
end of the day, there is the resource element that&#13;
&#13;
colleagues have talked about. Do we have enough resources&#13;
&#13;
to do this?&#13;
&#13;
         I happen to know that at field offices--I still&#13;
&#13;
repeat my message that we are not making use of local&#13;
&#13;
staff who are very skilled, specialized, especially in&#13;
&#13;
sector areas.   Especially from sectors here in Washington,&#13;
&#13;
they come and go, when in fact the capacity should be&#13;
&#13;
built there.    It is less costly, it is more effective, and&#13;
&#13;
it is sustainable, if I may add.&#13;

                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       73&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
            The other comment I have is my Point 18 on&#13;
&#13;
community-driven development.       I am surprised that it is&#13;
&#13;
not a policy of the Bank.      I wasn't aware.       If there is a&#13;
&#13;
machinery for making a difference, this is where we must&#13;
&#13;
move.&#13;
&#13;
            The advantage of community-driven interventions&#13;
&#13;
is that you are minimizing corruption.          These poor people,&#13;
&#13;
if you should try to divert their money, and you are&#13;
&#13;
living with them, they will deal with you.           They will deal&#13;
&#13;
with you.    So for me, the best thing is to empower them to&#13;
&#13;
decide for themselves, and they will handle whoever&#13;
&#13;
diverts their money.&#13;
&#13;
            The danger with some interventions is that we&#13;
&#13;
deal with the top, and where you have corruption involved,&#13;
&#13;
it becomes a post mortem exercise, when in fact you should&#13;
&#13;
make sure that money goes directly to the communities&#13;
&#13;
without fear of the money being diverted.&#13;
&#13;
            Then, in my statement, the last point is on page&#13;
&#13;
20, where we should really build on the ownership and&#13;
&#13;
expertise of clients.     You really do not have to spend a&#13;
&#13;
great deal.    Many countries indeed know what to do.         That&#13;
&#13;
is why I welcome this use, in poor countries particularly,&#13;
&#13;
of the PRSP approach.     They really know what to do.        It is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      74&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
a question of refining the process.        But more often than&#13;
&#13;
not, we pretend that we have different ways of doing&#13;
&#13;
business, and we duplicate efforts and spend more money&#13;
&#13;
unnecessarily.&#13;
&#13;
          So, Mr. Chairman, in summary, I want to agree&#13;
&#13;
that the two documents really should be combined into one,&#13;
&#13;
if I may say so, for publication.       It makes a lot of&#13;
&#13;
sense.   In response to the issues for discussion, you&#13;
&#13;
raised that point.&#13;
&#13;
          In summary, I am saying yes, we have done a&#13;
&#13;
great deal as demonstrated by the Bank's progress, but I&#13;
&#13;
think there is scope for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
          Second--I am responding to questions and key&#13;
&#13;
challenges--we agree with the chairman that the key&#13;
&#13;
challenge will be to deepen analytical work in the areas&#13;
&#13;
highlighted in this note.     It is only through this that&#13;
&#13;
the Bank and its partners will have a firm grip on the&#13;
&#13;
causes of poverty and the measures required to address it,&#13;
&#13;
such as empowerment and security.       The approaches are&#13;
&#13;
complex and will require a thorough understanding by both&#13;
&#13;
staff and clients.   We wonder how Management intends to&#13;
&#13;
deepen this analytical work beyond what we already know.&#13;
&#13;

                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     75&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         Third, we like the World Bank work on the&#13;
&#13;
linkages of poverty and population growth.         I think I have&#13;
&#13;
already mentioned that.    And I have already mentioned that&#13;
&#13;
with the Bank's decentralization, especially with respect&#13;
&#13;
to sector specialists at country level, we could have a&#13;
&#13;
new approach to sustainability and development.&#13;
&#13;
         Fourth, we support Management's proposal to&#13;
&#13;
improve efficiency in the delivery of its poverty program&#13;
&#13;
through the three areas that are mentioned, i.e.,&#13;
&#13;
empowerment, security, and opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
         As I said, we believe it will be useful to&#13;
&#13;
combine the two reports into one for public dissemination.&#13;
&#13;
         I thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:    Thank you, Richard, for this very&#13;
&#13;
useful addition to what you wrote.&#13;
&#13;
         Finn wants to come back on something.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. JONCK:     Yes, just a two-handed intervention&#13;
&#13;
on the growth-poverty distribution nexus.         A number of&#13;
&#13;
speakers have addressed this issue and I think have left&#13;
&#13;
us a little with the impression that we should only focus&#13;
&#13;
on the growth aspect.    It is an old discussion.&#13;
&#13;
         I emphasized in my intervention the need to look&#13;
&#13;
more closely at the distributional aspects of growth.           We&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      76&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
fully agree that growth is essential and important--there&#13;
&#13;
is no doubt about that--but we do see the linkage between&#13;
&#13;
growth and distribution, these two concepts intertwined in&#13;
&#13;
our fight against poverty. And I do believe that we are on&#13;
&#13;
rather firm ground in the form of experience and research.&#13;
&#13;
          If I could just quote from some of the two&#13;
&#13;
reports we have before us in paragraph 33 in the&#13;
&#13;
operationalization paper, it is clearly said that&#13;
&#13;
distribution "can impact growth and its sustainability."&#13;
&#13;
          Also, in paragraph 20 of the progress report, it&#13;
&#13;
is said that "Countries with high levels of initial&#13;
&#13;
inequality have reduced poverty less for given rates of&#13;
&#13;
growth than countries with low initial inequality."&#13;
&#13;
          I think this is what lies behind the idea in the&#13;
&#13;
paper of analyzing also alternative paths of pro-poor&#13;
&#13;
growth.   There is not just one solution to this.         The&#13;
&#13;
distributional aspects in our view are very important for&#13;
&#13;
the results it may achieve.     So I don't think we should be&#13;
&#13;
left with the impression that one thing is more important&#13;
&#13;
than the other thing here.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. STEK:   Thank you, Finn.&#13;
&#13;
          There are a few points that I want to make which&#13;
&#13;
are somewhat disjointed, because I don't want to make a&#13;
&#13;

                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       77&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
full statement after all the very thoughtful comments from&#13;
&#13;
colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
           I believe that the empowerment discussion is&#13;
&#13;
important.    I am glad the Bank is trying to face the&#13;
&#13;
challenge.    I thought interesting comments were made by&#13;
&#13;
colleagues on the community-driven development.           I think a&#13;
&#13;
more fundamental discussion needs to take place.           At the&#13;
&#13;
level of each individual community-driven project, one is&#13;
&#13;
impressed by what it can do locally, but there is a&#13;
&#13;
question of scale, and there is a question of impact in&#13;
&#13;
the country as a whole and whether the Bank is the&#13;
&#13;
organization, as Jan brought out, to deal with this in the&#13;
&#13;
best possible way.&#13;
&#13;
           So there are organizational questions and scale&#13;
&#13;
questions here that need to be tackled, translating also,&#13;
&#13;
ultimately, into a question of ownership at the government&#13;
&#13;
level.   So there are complicated relationships here which&#13;
&#13;
make it worth having a real discussion.&#13;
&#13;
           Then, something that we don't talk about half&#13;
&#13;
enough is the issue of population growth and reproductive&#13;
&#13;
health. We have a department in the Bank dealing with&#13;
&#13;
this.    It would be interesting--I don't want particularly&#13;
&#13;
to focus on Jan's authorities--but we do know that there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      78&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
is a certain view held in this country which makes it,&#13;
&#13;
let's say, not a comfortable subject to discuss--&#13;
&#13;
comfortable in terms of the funding issues--and I don't&#13;
&#13;
know if Jan will be able to say something about that, but&#13;
&#13;
I am not going to ask her especially to do so unless she&#13;
&#13;
wants to volunteer.   But we know that this country doesn't&#13;
&#13;
make it easier to apply the right amount of funds to this&#13;
&#13;
issue, particularly once the word "reproductive health" is&#13;
&#13;
translated into "birth control."&#13;
&#13;
          Then, I think very important is being more&#13;
&#13;
concrete on how to make markets work in a way that is&#13;
&#13;
useful for the mission of the Bank and which at the same&#13;
&#13;
time may provide a lot of commonality with what&#13;
&#13;
governments themselves want to achieve in their countries.&#13;
&#13;
Markets are a hugely effective mechanism, and we need to&#13;
&#13;
harness them to growth and to the issues of pro-poor&#13;
&#13;
growth.   I am very glad that that is brought out, and yet&#13;
&#13;
there is obviously a lot of work that still needs to be&#13;
&#13;
done.&#13;
&#13;
          I share the points made by those who spoke about&#13;
&#13;
the budget and the lack of clarity or specificity of that&#13;
&#13;
paragraph.   I think a very concrete example where there is&#13;
&#13;
some alarming specificity is the amount of money that I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       79&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
have heard is going to be made available for gender from&#13;
&#13;
the Center, which is only $600,000 or something like that,&#13;
&#13;
while we know that the not extraordinarily ambitious&#13;
&#13;
figure that was mentioned by Karen Mason is on the order&#13;
&#13;
of $4 million being needed.      The rest, I understand, has&#13;
&#13;
to then come from the Regions, and it is not clear what&#13;
&#13;
incentives there are unless the Regions are forced           into&#13;
&#13;
dealing with something that is essential to poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction and yet is hard to bring them to focus on&#13;
&#13;
because it appears to them to be an extra challenge.&#13;
&#13;
         So there are big issues here which have not been&#13;
&#13;
dealt with, and I think something similar may be the case&#13;
&#13;
for trade where, thanks to the pressure from DEC by now&#13;
&#13;
and from PREM, trade has moved more into the sites of&#13;
&#13;
management, yet there, there are also questions of money.&#13;
&#13;
         Then, others brought out the issue of capacity&#13;
&#13;
building and monitoring and evaluation, and exactly what&#13;
&#13;
can we envisage in terms of the budgetary appropriations&#13;
&#13;
that are needed.&#13;
&#13;
         Finally, on impact analysis, I share with&#13;
&#13;
colleagues the extraordinary importance with which we&#13;
&#13;
regard this.   I think OED made all the right points in&#13;
&#13;
Greg's introduction.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                       80&#13;

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         I now want to turn to others in the audience and&#13;
&#13;
ask if they have points they want to make.&#13;
&#13;
         Inamul, you have the floor.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. HAQUE:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
         I think this discussion has been so rich that it&#13;
&#13;
will be presumptuous on my part to add anything to it.             I&#13;
&#13;
would only say that even non-members share the wise views&#13;
&#13;
of the members of the Committee--or, I would say that ex-&#13;
&#13;
members share the views of the present members of the&#13;
&#13;
Committee.&#13;
&#13;
         Mr. Chairman, I have only one or two points.&#13;
&#13;
One, you have already touched on--trade.            But trade is&#13;
&#13;
also important to the specific discussion today.           We have&#13;
&#13;
talked about rural development, we have talked about&#13;
&#13;
agriculture.   Particularly in the context of agriculture,&#13;
&#13;
agriculture can become really an engine for poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction through exports.      And when we talk about&#13;
&#13;
exports, one will have to contend with barriers and market&#13;
&#13;
access problems.&#13;
&#13;
         So we will have to take a more holistic view&#13;
&#13;
when we are talking about agricultural development, and I&#13;
&#13;
am happy that at least in the statement of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
President as well as an MD of the Fund, this is figuring,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     81&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
and I think that as you also pointed out, things are&#13;
&#13;
moving positively as far as this institution is concerned,&#13;
&#13;
but we will have to keep on it.&#13;
&#13;
         Secondly, Mr. Chairman, we come to the point of&#13;
&#13;
poverty, growth, productivity.     I would like to remind my&#13;
&#13;
colleagues here that I was one of the first Directors who&#13;
&#13;
the other day quoted with approval, in a joint&#13;
&#13;
CODE/Personnel Committee meeting, the standpoint taken by&#13;
&#13;
the Treasury Secretary of the United States.&#13;
&#13;
         But admiration has its own limits, and I would&#13;
&#13;
like to cross the limit today.     I am very reassured by&#13;
&#13;
what Jan has told us today, but the fact remains that it&#13;
&#13;
is necessary and essential if the Bank institution itself-&#13;
&#13;
-and Jan's particular responsibility is to remain in&#13;
&#13;
interactive dialogue with the authorities in the U.S. to&#13;
&#13;
tell them that when we talk about distribution, we are not&#13;
&#13;
talking about socialistic redistribution, we are not&#13;
&#13;
talking about a throwback to the seventies.         Distribution&#13;
&#13;
has become a very important thing.       As my Scandinavian&#13;
&#13;
colleague pointed out, distribution is not something which&#13;
&#13;
is anti-entrepreneurship, it is not anti-motivational.&#13;
&#13;
Actually, it is important if you want to have more&#13;
&#13;
entrepreneurship, more motivation, better development of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       82&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
the private sector, that something be done about quality&#13;
&#13;
of growth.&#13;
&#13;
            I think that in the U.S. stand, I have seen the&#13;
&#13;
subtle difference coming every day, and it is something&#13;
&#13;
very positive.    So I hope that that direction will&#13;
&#13;
continue and this message will get across that this is&#13;
&#13;
very important.&#13;
&#13;
            Lastly, Mr. Chairman, we have been talking about&#13;
&#13;
Voices of the Poor, and that is a wonderful phrase. We&#13;
&#13;
must hear the voices, but we will have to go beyond&#13;
&#13;
hearing, because the whole thing is action, not just&#13;
&#13;
hearing.    Hearing should be registered and should lead to&#13;
&#13;
action.&#13;
&#13;
            In this context, I would like to come to a point&#13;
&#13;
which has been made here about the architecture, about the&#13;
&#13;
instrument.    Let's assume that we are going to build a&#13;
&#13;
grand mansion.    Architectural elegance is critical and&#13;
&#13;
important.    Engineering and design is very, very&#13;
&#13;
important.    But by themselves, they cannot build the&#13;
&#13;
building.    It is action.   And when you talk about action,&#13;
&#13;
you are talking about bricks and mortar.            And when you&#13;
&#13;
talk about bricks and mortar, you talk about resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       83&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
            So what is happening today is that perhaps the&#13;
&#13;
quality of assistance is improving.         Conditions in&#13;
&#13;
developing countries have become better because there is&#13;
&#13;
greater receptivity and greater analysis of what is wrong&#13;
&#13;
for poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
            But I am afraid, Mr. Chairman, that the&#13;
&#13;
resources are diminishing, and all of this discussion will&#13;
&#13;
not take us further unless something is being done at the&#13;
&#13;
same time--not by the Bank itself, essentially, but by the&#13;
&#13;
shareholders of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
            Lastly--I said "lastly" once earlier, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Chairman, and I therefore ask your forgiveness--is the&#13;
&#13;
disconnect we find between the location of the problem and&#13;
&#13;
tue question of response.      As B.P. has brought out, where&#13;
&#13;
is the theater of war--the theater of war is in Sub-&#13;
&#13;
Saharan Africa, the theater of war is in Sub-Saharan&#13;
&#13;
Africa, the theater of war is in South Asia.           And what&#13;
&#13;
resources are going even from this institutions, whose&#13;
&#13;
mission is fighting poverty?       I think that that has to be&#13;
&#13;
remedied.&#13;
&#13;
            I can paraphrase what Sir Winston Churchill used&#13;
&#13;
to say, and that is that the artillery of the Bank is very&#13;
&#13;
powerful but not mobile enough.        It is firing at targets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      84&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
which have moved. So we will have to fire at the target&#13;
&#13;
which is really the target.     So this disconnect, this lack&#13;
&#13;
of linkage, will have to go.      Affirmative action is&#13;
&#13;
required in this regard, and unless that is done, I am&#13;
&#13;
afraid you will continue to have more and more poor in the&#13;
&#13;
world and at the same time, more and more assistance will&#13;
&#13;
be required.&#13;
&#13;
         That reminds me and that brings me to what has&#13;
&#13;
been the criticism of the Bank in documents like the&#13;
&#13;
Meltzer report.   This is precisely the point they are&#13;
&#13;
making--lest you become a grant-issuing agency.          Why?&#13;
&#13;
Because money is not going where it should go.          So that&#13;
&#13;
direction of assistance is very important.&#13;
&#13;
         Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         That takes care of all the speakers.&#13;
&#13;
         I would now invite Management to respond with&#13;
&#13;
some focus also on the very concrete questions and&#13;
&#13;
comments that were made, like Jan's Time-bound Action&#13;
&#13;
Plans--I think Richard and perhaps others also spoke in&#13;
&#13;
those terms--what can countries handle, and where is the&#13;
&#13;
budget to do all of this.     Please be concrete, and where&#13;
&#13;
are the responsibilities.&#13;

          You have the floor to deal with everything that&#13;
&#13;
we brought up.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. PAGE:   Do we have three-and-a-half hours,&#13;
&#13;
Pieter?&#13;
&#13;
          MR. STEK:   I think there is something on gender&#13;
&#13;
at 12:30, isn't there--gender and PRSPs in room 4-301.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. PAGE:   So this is like the role of the tenor&#13;
&#13;
in a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta--it is to say&#13;
&#13;
"operationalization" three times very quickly.&#13;
&#13;
          Let me begin and then ask several of my comments&#13;
&#13;
to respond in specific areas.     In fact, to give you a&#13;
&#13;
preview, I'll ask John to come back to you on some of the&#13;
&#13;
issues of the core ESW program and the relationship of&#13;
&#13;
that to the budget, because those of us in PREM, of&#13;
&#13;
course, are somewhat at the receiving end of this&#13;
&#13;
discussion as opposed to the initiating end of it, and the&#13;
&#13;
pipeline of OP/BPs, the relationship of, if you like, the&#13;
&#13;
legal instructions to staff to this process.&#13;
&#13;
          I will then ask Giovanna to have a word on&#13;
&#13;
monitoring and evaluation and how that fits into our work&#13;
&#13;
on impact analysis; Steen, on community-driven development&#13;
&#13;
and conflict issues; Deepa on the empowerment work that is&#13;
&#13;
going on, and Shahrokh Fardoust, who is with us from DEC,&#13;
&#13;

                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     86&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
there was a question on the IDGs and how we are moving in&#13;
&#13;
terms of costing and delivering on that program.         There is&#13;
&#13;
some work that has been going on in DEC there.&#13;
&#13;
         Let me start with, at the risk of Pieter saying&#13;
&#13;
that I'm too general, some issues that have come up in the&#13;
&#13;
general framework, the first of which is I thought&#13;
&#13;
Matthias' very interesting point about bring the WDR into&#13;
&#13;
our operational context and the relationship between these&#13;
&#13;
two bodies of work which, I think for those of us who are&#13;
&#13;
sitting in the trenches, is seen in a somewhat different&#13;
&#13;
perspective. And I know that I have said this before, but&#13;
&#13;
I would like to reemphasize it.&#13;
&#13;
         For those of us who have been dealing with these&#13;
&#13;
issues, the WDR did not spring from the imagination of&#13;
&#13;
Ravi Kanbur and his colleagues. This WDR in particular is&#13;
&#13;
the outcome of an interaction between thinkers and doers,&#13;
&#13;
and much of what the WDR does is to summarize already what&#13;
&#13;
you know to be good practice that has been going on in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, and to some extent, that was some of the difficulty&#13;
&#13;
in telling you about operationalizing the WDR, that many&#13;
&#13;
aspects of the WDR were already operational.         We saw that&#13;
&#13;
in the PRSPs; we have seen it in the low-income business&#13;
&#13;
model; we have seen it now in the Strategic Framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     87&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
Paper; we have seen it, for example, in the evolution of&#13;
&#13;
the Environment Strategy; we are seeing it in the&#13;
&#13;
evolution of other sector strategies.&#13;
&#13;
         So I think it is very important to understand&#13;
&#13;
that the insight of the WDR, that you need opportunity,&#13;
&#13;
empowerment, and security for an effective attack on&#13;
&#13;
poverty, is a powerful metaphor, if you will.         And the&#13;
&#13;
insight in the words of the 1950s American song that "you&#13;
&#13;
can't have one without the other" is again very important.&#13;
&#13;
But it is not something which is fundamentally new,&#13;
&#13;
revolutionary, or indeed strikingly original to people who&#13;
&#13;
have been working in the field, whether in the Bank or in&#13;
&#13;
other aid agencies.&#13;
&#13;
         Therefore, in a sense, what we are really saying&#13;
&#13;
is how do we--and I think it wasp ut very well by several&#13;
&#13;
Directors--make sure that that then becomes our way of&#13;
&#13;
working as a routine business practice as opposed to being&#13;
&#13;
examples of good practice.    That is what we have tried to&#13;
&#13;
show today.&#13;
&#13;
         In that light, I think it is very important,&#13;
&#13;
having heard several views around the table, if you will&#13;
&#13;
allow me a moment of nostalgia to reflect back on another&#13;
&#13;
report that provoked a good deal of controversy in 1993,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       88&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
before many people's time, which is called the "East Asian&#13;
&#13;
Miracle."&#13;
&#13;
            What was very interesting about that report was&#13;
&#13;
that for all the controversy about the relative roles of&#13;
&#13;
state and market, there was almost no controversy about&#13;
&#13;
the central powerful finding of that report, which was&#13;
&#13;
that the countries analyzed were perhaps the only&#13;
&#13;
countries in the four-year post-war experience that had&#13;
&#13;
succeeded in having both rapid economic growth and&#13;
&#13;
improvements in income distribution.&#13;
&#13;
            One of the questions we asked ourselves is why&#13;
&#13;
was that so, and the answer was that political authorities&#13;
&#13;
in those countries--and they were very different--&#13;
&#13;
undertook strategies which were quite similar, and they&#13;
&#13;
were strategies of what we called "shared growth."           They&#13;
&#13;
were strategies that emphasized both the need for society&#13;
&#13;
to sacrifice for rapid economic growth which was the&#13;
&#13;
foundation of the process of poverty reduction, but also&#13;
&#13;
conscious interventions by government so that all elements&#13;
&#13;
of the society would share to some extent in the benefits&#13;
&#13;
of that growth.    We thought that that was really kind of&#13;
&#13;
unique and interesting as a social experiment and as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
political economy experiment in contrast with many other&#13;
&#13;
parts of the world.&#13;
&#13;
         We seem to have lost to some extent in this&#13;
&#13;
dialogue about distribution versus growth that insight,&#13;
&#13;
and I think we need to bring that back into the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
work, an understanding that to have a social consensus for&#13;
&#13;
growth-oriented policies, you also have to have a&#13;
&#13;
perception on the part of the majority of your society&#13;
&#13;
that growth is beneficial.    I think that is the crux of&#13;
&#13;
this issue of growth as the central pillar.         It is an&#13;
&#13;
other way of seeing opportunity, empowerment, and security&#13;
&#13;
brought together in the context of national strategies.&#13;
&#13;
         Having said that, we then come to the next trend&#13;
&#13;
in thinking, which I very much welcome, and I think&#13;
&#13;
particularly people like Giovanna who have worked on these&#13;
&#13;
reports for a number of years very much welcome, although&#13;
&#13;
we wish we had better answers for you, and that is the&#13;
&#13;
need to shift from measuring inputs to measuring outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
That is consistent certainly with our work on PRSPs, it is&#13;
&#13;
certainly consistent with our work on poverty analysis.&#13;
&#13;
         How we will do that and how we will do that in&#13;
&#13;
concert with local institutions, both public, private, and&#13;
&#13;
nongovernmental, I think is an important challenge for us.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
Here, I can only point out to you in terms of specific&#13;
&#13;
progress that the two trust funds that we are now bringing&#13;
&#13;
to bear through the PRSP process to measure impact--the&#13;
&#13;
Multi-Donor Trust Fund and the new extension of the&#13;
&#13;
Norwegian trust fund--both very much emphasize the need to&#13;
&#13;
have local institutions involved in this work and to&#13;
&#13;
mainstream this work.&#13;
&#13;
         Similarly in our work on social impact analysis,&#13;
&#13;
the focus of our work and the Fund's is to try to move it&#13;
&#13;
upstream, embody it in local institutions, public and&#13;
&#13;
nongovernmental, so that we are not simply going in in the&#13;
&#13;
kind of traditional manner, analyzing the problem, and&#13;
&#13;
then leaving, and leaving nothing behind.          We understand&#13;
&#13;
that ultimately, we have to build capability within the&#13;
&#13;
countries and get them to recognize the priority of&#13;
&#13;
measuring outcomes.   Otherwise, this is not going to be&#13;
&#13;
sustainable, and we'll be back to you a year or two years'&#13;
&#13;
hence, saying we don't yet know what the impact of our&#13;
&#13;
interventions has been.&#13;
&#13;
         Having said that, I think it is important, in&#13;
&#13;
the words of one of my IMF friends, to manage our&#13;
&#13;
expectations.   We have been trying to deal with this issue&#13;
&#13;
of impact analysis, with the idea of the counterfactual--&#13;

                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     91&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
we have just recently seen it in a discussion of the&#13;
&#13;
perspective on adjustment lending.       It is quite difficult&#13;
&#13;
to work out the alternative outcomes that might have taken&#13;
&#13;
place when certain choices were made.        That doesn't&#13;
&#13;
dismiss us from the need to study the social impact and&#13;
&#13;
poverty impact of policy choices that are being foreseen,&#13;
&#13;
but it does mean that following up and seeing whether or&#13;
&#13;
not the consequences were actually what we predicted has&#13;
&#13;
got to be much more central to our work program, and that&#13;
&#13;
is certainly the way we are moving, and we will be&#13;
&#13;
briefing you on that work as we move into the round of&#13;
&#13;
briefings on the PRSP process in line with the fall&#13;
&#13;
meetings of the Governors.&#13;
&#13;
         In terms of Finn's specific question on&#13;
&#13;
distributional impact, distributional impact, poverty&#13;
&#13;
impact, incidence analysis, social impact--different cuts&#13;
&#13;
on this issue of what is the distributional or social&#13;
&#13;
outcome of various choices.    So we'll try to reduce the&#13;
&#13;
volume of technical terms, but essentially trying to look&#13;
&#13;
at that set of questions.&#13;
&#13;
         Integration--absolutely essential.          Here, I&#13;
&#13;
think the key issue whether we are talking about&#13;
&#13;
agriculture and its role in rural development, whether we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        92&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
are talking about trade and its role in national&#13;
&#13;
strategies for broadly-shared economic growth, whether we&#13;
&#13;
are talking about human development issues in a poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction strategy, given our structure, the central locus&#13;
&#13;
of integration has to take place at the level of the&#13;
&#13;
country team, and the central integrator has got to be the&#13;
&#13;
Country Director.&#13;
&#13;
         So I would agree with you, and perhaps as we&#13;
&#13;
think about time-bound programs of change, we should think&#13;
&#13;
about ways in which we can equip our Country Directors&#13;
&#13;
better to carry out that function.          I believe this is one&#13;
&#13;
of the issues that is now on the agenda for OPCS, because&#13;
&#13;
that has now become in a sense the home for Country&#13;
&#13;
Directors.&#13;
&#13;
         It is also an area where we are through our&#13;
&#13;
training programs and through our engagements with sector&#13;
&#13;
staff trying to get them to understand that they can both&#13;
&#13;
forcefully advocate for the role of their sector.            Having&#13;
&#13;
been once a project division chief, I try to remind myself&#13;
&#13;
and my colleagues that the reason why sector staff want to&#13;
&#13;
work in their sector in every country is not because it is&#13;
&#13;
an employment generation program--it is because they do&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     93&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
roads, or they do health, or they do education because&#13;
&#13;
they believe it is fundamental to the development process.&#13;
&#13;
         But again, in the words of Gilbert and Sullivan,&#13;
&#13;
"if everybody is somebody, no one is anybody."         At some&#13;
&#13;
point, strategic choices need to be made.&#13;
&#13;
         The PRSP presents us with a powerful tool for&#13;
&#13;
making those strategic choices.      By encouraging early and&#13;
&#13;
open dialogue but then allowing national authorities to&#13;
&#13;
choose their priorities, we also have to begin to&#13;
&#13;
discipline ourselves and say that our Country Assistance&#13;
&#13;
Strategies have to reflect and enhance that vision rather&#13;
&#13;
than our own vision of what is important.&#13;
&#13;
         So the integrating function of the Country&#13;
&#13;
Director in making that happen is fundamental not just to&#13;
&#13;
the success of our poverty reduction efforts but to the&#13;
&#13;
whole success of our low-income business model.         I think I&#13;
&#13;
would agree with some colleagues and some members of the&#13;
&#13;
Board that we need to work harder on trying to help&#13;
&#13;
Country Directors and their colleagues and country teams&#13;
&#13;
understand both the need to advocate but also the need for&#13;
&#13;
restraint in cases where they cannot be present at every&#13;
&#13;
place in every country all the time.&#13;

         Finally, a word on donor coordination.            We are&#13;
&#13;
making progress.   It is not as rapid as many of us would&#13;
&#13;
like, but to reassure Jan, recently, the Development&#13;
&#13;
Assistance Committee of the OECD has come together around&#13;
&#13;
a set of guidelines for poverty reduction which very much&#13;
&#13;
parallel the presentation that we have given to you today&#13;
&#13;
and many of the concerns in the WDR.         We see that as&#13;
&#13;
making process in terms of coherence among members of the&#13;
&#13;
DEC in terms of their view of poverty reduction efforts.&#13;
&#13;
         We have a recent and, finally, notable&#13;
&#13;
achievement in the adoption of a DEC resolution on&#13;
&#13;
harmonization   of donor procedures.        It is not    highly&#13;
&#13;
ambitious, but it shows substantial progress.           I have been&#13;
&#13;
going to DEC meetings for my sins now for three years, and&#13;
&#13;
this is the first time we have actually come to a&#13;
&#13;
conclusion in that dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
         In the case of statistics and capacity-building&#13;
&#13;
for data analysis, I think Paris 21 is making good&#13;
&#13;
progress in partnership.&#13;
&#13;
         And of course, in many of the cases of the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
effort, the willingness of the European Union, the&#13;
&#13;
willingness of our colleagues in UNDP, the ILO, and UNESCO&#13;
&#13;
to begin to come around the PRSP process, the willingness&#13;

&#13;
of some bilateral donors to again try to begin to see how&#13;
&#13;
the PRSP can help to inform their own programs in low-&#13;
&#13;
income countries, I think is all positive.           We still have&#13;
&#13;
a lot to do, and every time I talk to people who are&#13;
&#13;
country authorities in our client countries, this need to&#13;
&#13;
begin to rationalize, harmonize, become more consistent,&#13;
&#13;
both with our advice and with our operations, emerges as a&#13;
&#13;
major issue.    But I would say that in contrast with two&#13;
&#13;
years ago, we have made some substantial progress.&#13;
&#13;
            Let me stop there and turn to John.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. UNDERWOOD:   I'm going to start with ESW,&#13;
&#13;
because I think that is a bit easier question to answer.&#13;
&#13;
There, as you know, we have made that a budget priority.&#13;
&#13;
            I think that what we have in mind and what we&#13;
&#13;
need to maybe explain better is that we have this idea of&#13;
&#13;
two pieces of core economic and sector work, one on this&#13;
&#13;
overarching social and structural agenda.           That doesn't&#13;
&#13;
mean that this piece of work goes into everything deeply,&#13;
&#13;
but it essentially draws what we know and what we don't&#13;
&#13;
know together and identifies the gaps. So in some&#13;
&#13;
countries, that is where the specific country specificity&#13;
&#13;
comes in.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      96&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         In any case, what we are trying to do there is&#13;
&#13;
identify what needs to be done in very specific country&#13;
&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
         The other piece is integrated fiduciary piece.&#13;
&#13;
         And then, feeding into CASs, in the CAS, too,&#13;
&#13;
with this work in hand, hopefully--but even before we have&#13;
&#13;
it in hand--we are working with Country Directors to&#13;
&#13;
identify gaps.   A very important part of the upstream&#13;
&#13;
review of CASs now is what do you know and where are the&#13;
&#13;
gaps and what needs to be filled.       In that respect,&#13;
&#13;
basically everything we do now is done in partnership with&#13;
&#13;
a country, so a part of virtually all of our ESW is&#13;
&#13;
bringing in local researchers, making sure that what we&#13;
&#13;
are doing is very much in partnership.&#13;
&#13;
         And we are going to start making a much bigger&#13;
&#13;
effort to reach out to other development partners, first&#13;
&#13;
by, hopefully this month, gathering together and seeing&#13;
&#13;
what each is doing in these various areas so we can better&#13;
&#13;
start coordinating our work in the future and get more out&#13;
&#13;
of the limited money we all have for this very important&#13;
&#13;
set of analytical work.&#13;
&#13;
         With respect to the budget, I hope that&#13;
&#13;
everything that we have been putting together--the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Framework Paper came up today, Strategic&#13;
&#13;
Directions, et cetera, the budget, the poverty report--I&#13;
&#13;
hope that in your mind you start seeing all of these&#13;
&#13;
things fitting together, because at least in our minds,&#13;
&#13;
they all try to go in the same direction.&#13;
&#13;
         And as John was saying with the question about&#13;
&#13;
accountability and monitoring, accountability has to be&#13;
&#13;
with the Regions and the Country Directors.         We can't just&#13;
&#13;
divide the budget up and give "x" amount to one sector and&#13;
&#13;
"y" amount to another sector; we'll lose the whole country&#13;
&#13;
focus.&#13;
&#13;
         That said, we still see a central role for&#13;
&#13;
monitoring, and in the case of poverty, the Poverty Board&#13;
&#13;
as having a very important monitoring function and other&#13;
&#13;
sector boards the same.&#13;
&#13;
         Mr. Kaijuka mentioned weak performers.          As we&#13;
&#13;
have said before, that is an important issue. We have&#13;
&#13;
learned that putting money where the policies are not in&#13;
&#13;
place is just not a good idea.     On the other hand, we have&#13;
&#13;
weak performers that are poor, and we need to better&#13;
&#13;
understand how we help them.&#13;
&#13;
         This is a budgetary issue.        It is not a lending&#13;
&#13;
issue, but it is an internal budgetary issue, because in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       98&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
order to be able to work with weak performers, we need to&#13;
&#13;
have the budget in those country teams.            But we will be&#13;
&#13;
coming back to the Board on that issue.&#13;
&#13;
           On the issue of lending that Mr. Singh raised, I&#13;
&#13;
think we have to differentiate between IBRD and IDA, and&#13;
&#13;
as you know, a very large share of IDA goes to Africa and&#13;
&#13;
a large share to South Asia.      IBRD lending is a bit&#13;
&#13;
different, and Mr. Ruiz brought up the issue of&#13;
&#13;
vulnerability.   As you know, in the Middle-Income Task&#13;
&#13;
Force report and even earlier in our actual lending&#13;
&#13;
practice, we have had up and down swings where we have had&#13;
&#13;
some very large commitments to East Asia and Latin&#13;
&#13;
America, and we hope that that did help us avoid poverty&#13;
&#13;
problems that would have existed had we not done this&#13;
&#13;
lending.   So we see that as actually having a poverty&#13;
&#13;
focus.&#13;
&#13;
           On the OP/BP program, I think we have reported&#13;
&#13;
elsewhere--with respect to this particular Operational&#13;
&#13;
Policy, we'll be starting to work with the poverty group&#13;
&#13;
immediately on the revision of the policy and we will be&#13;
&#13;
discussing with CODE when and how you want to discuss it&#13;
&#13;
as we move forward.&#13;

                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       99&#13;

&#13;
         MS. PRENNUSHI:     I will just briefly address a&#13;
&#13;
couple of issues related to M and E and impact assessment&#13;
&#13;
which have been brought up.&#13;
&#13;
         I really think there is a lot more work, better&#13;
&#13;
systems and stronger capacity in place.            If I think back&#13;
&#13;
to where we were--and in fact this is something that came&#13;
&#13;
up very clearly when the WDR was being prepared--where we&#13;
&#13;
were when the 1990 WDR was written and where we are this&#13;
&#13;
time around, the difference in terms of data available and&#13;
&#13;
analysis available is enormous.       At the time of the 1990&#13;
&#13;
WDR, there were numbers on income and poverty, which is a&#13;
&#13;
limited way to look at poverty, but nonetheless, for I&#13;
&#13;
think less than 60 countries.      We had more than twice as&#13;
&#13;
many this time around.    We also had information from&#13;
&#13;
participatory sources, from the Voices of the Poor Study,&#13;
&#13;
for this WDR.   That was unheard of 10 years ago.&#13;
&#13;
         So I think there is much more that we know on&#13;
&#13;
the extent of poverty and in terms of other various types&#13;
&#13;
of indicators of poverty than there was 10 years ago.&#13;
&#13;
         What is probably needed now is to systematize&#13;
&#13;
what we know.   This is probably true both in terms of what&#13;
&#13;
we know in terms of trends overall and at the country&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                       735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                   Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       100&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
level and in terms of capacity and systems in place in&#13;
&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
         For this reason, what we should probably focus&#13;
&#13;
on in the course of the next year and report to you on in&#13;
&#13;
the next progress report is this--where we are in terms of&#13;
&#13;
what we know about impacts and where we are in terms of&#13;
&#13;
capacity and systems in countries.         For those of you who&#13;
&#13;
have seen these reports over time, we have had a much&#13;
&#13;
stronger emphasis on trends in global measures of poverty&#13;
&#13;
in the last two or three years, and in fact, right now, as&#13;
&#13;
an institution together with others, we are doing a lot of&#13;
&#13;
work on the International Development Goals.&#13;
&#13;
         So I think that at the global level, we have&#13;
&#13;
much more information on what is happening to poverty.&#13;
&#13;
         The area where we should report to you more&#13;
&#13;
systematically is what is happening at the country level&#13;
&#13;
and what we know about the link between policies and&#13;
&#13;
outcomes at the country level.       So we will focus more on&#13;
&#13;
that in the course of this year and report in the next&#13;
&#13;
progress report.&#13;
&#13;
         Similarly, as I said, we will carry out an&#13;
&#13;
exercise taking stock of what the situation is on the&#13;
&#13;
ground in terms of systems and capacity, which also means&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
we will refine what we think are good guidelines for&#13;
&#13;
setting up the systems, what are the key tools for poverty&#13;
&#13;
monitoring, what are key requirements in terms of making&#13;
&#13;
the information public, in terms of building capacity in&#13;
&#13;
countries for analysis, and we'll take stock of the&#13;
&#13;
situation, a bit similarly to what was done on expenditure&#13;
&#13;
tracking.    So we will report back on that in a year's time&#13;
&#13;
at the latest.&#13;
&#13;
            Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. STEK:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            Go ahead--and perhaps you can also mention the&#13;
&#13;
answer to why there has been a reduction in poverty&#13;
&#13;
assessments in a significant number.&#13;
&#13;
            MS. PIERCY:   No, no--social assessments.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. STEK:    The social assessments.        Okay.&#13;
&#13;
            MS. PRENNUSHI:   If you don't mind, I'll take&#13;
&#13;
that up, the on one poverty assessments.&#13;
&#13;
            As the report discusses, there is really a&#13;
&#13;
change in the way the analysis is done.             There is not less&#13;
&#13;
analysis; it is just that less frequently it is done in a&#13;
&#13;
piece of work that is called a poverty assessment. So our&#13;
&#13;
systems are still not so good in tracking all of these&#13;
&#13;
other bits and pieces of poverty analysis, but there is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
lot of it.   It is done at the regional level, for example-&#13;
&#13;
-these studies in ECA and in LAC and so on are regional in&#13;
&#13;
nature.   There is a lot of work done at the sub-national&#13;
&#13;
level, for example, in India, in Brazil, in other&#13;
&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
          So I think that what we need to do is to really&#13;
&#13;
refine the way we, if you wish, count these things rather&#13;
&#13;
than worry about the fact that there is less of it.&#13;

          My name is Steen Jorgensen, and I am the co-&#13;
&#13;
chair with Cheryl Gray of the PREM group and the&#13;
&#13;
infrastructure group in Africa of the Community-Driven&#13;
&#13;
Development Working Group that we have in the Bank.            I am&#13;
&#13;
myself from the Environment and Socially Sustainable&#13;
&#13;
Development Network, which is another hard thing to say in&#13;
&#13;
terms of the words here.&#13;
&#13;
          Let me just say briefly that we had actually&#13;
&#13;
suggested earlier that we should do a Board briefing on&#13;
&#13;
community-driven development, but in the discussions, they&#13;
&#13;
felt that the Board agenda was so full, and you wanted to&#13;
&#13;
focus on other things.      But I hear you now, and we will&#13;
&#13;
get back to you.&#13;

&#13;
          Let me just address some of the specific&#13;
&#13;
questions raised, and then I hope we can have a much&#13;
&#13;
longer discussion, because it really deserves it.&#13;
&#13;
          The first point to make is that the discussion&#13;
&#13;
needs to be around whether the Bank should do more or&#13;
&#13;
less.   This is an area, like Mr. Meyer said, that we have&#13;
&#13;
been engaged in for quite a while.        According to the&#13;
&#13;
report, we are talking about between $1.5 billion and $2&#13;
&#13;
billion that is somehow linked to programs where&#13;
&#13;
communities have decisionmaking authority or actually&#13;
&#13;
manage the resources themselves.&#13;
&#13;
          What is new about it?      Well, what is new about&#13;
&#13;
it is very much what John said.       This is a gradual change&#13;
&#13;
over time, but what is new about it right now is that&#13;
&#13;
there is more focus moving from sustainable, individual&#13;
&#13;
little projects to building sustainable local&#13;
&#13;
institutions.   The only way you can have sustainable local&#13;
&#13;
institutions--and that is the second trend--is to link it&#13;
&#13;
up with decentralization processes and the role of&#13;
&#13;
government.&#13;
&#13;
          I was grateful to hear the statement on&#13;
&#13;
governance and community-driven development.          That is very&#13;
&#13;
much one of the things we are finding.         It is hard to get&#13;

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
the hard data on it from DEC and so on, but it is clear&#13;
&#13;
that the evidence we get from participatory service is&#13;
&#13;
that there is much less corruption in these programs&#13;
&#13;
because, as the gentleman said, communities manage these&#13;
&#13;
funds; it is a lot of money for these communities, and&#13;
&#13;
they manage them very well--better than any army of&#13;
&#13;
auditors you could send out there.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, it is linking it to market access.          It&#13;
&#13;
is not enough to think that communities can do these&#13;
&#13;
things by themselves unless there is access to markets and&#13;
&#13;
unless there is productive capacity being built.           It is&#13;
&#13;
not enough that the community repairs the roof the school,&#13;
&#13;
but how can that community group then engage in more&#13;
&#13;
directly   productive investments.&#13;
&#13;
           How do we structure this?       You don't have Bank&#13;
&#13;
staff running around in lots of villages, sitting under&#13;
&#13;
trees, helping to organize communities.            What we do is we&#13;
&#13;
work through intermediaries.      This is one of the areas&#13;
&#13;
where we follow the lead of lots of other donors.&#13;
&#13;
           There are lots of other agencies and lots of&#13;
&#13;
other agencies, but there are three things that other&#13;
&#13;
people tell us is our comparative advantage.           One is that&#13;
&#13;
we are one of the few agencies that is both multisectoral&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
and global.    Community-driven development is&#13;
&#13;
multisectoral.   If you come in as the education person&#13;
&#13;
asking the community what they want, they will say--guess&#13;
&#13;
what--education, because they know that is what you are&#13;
&#13;
there that you would like to provide.&#13;
&#13;
          So we have an advantage in working with&#13;
&#13;
governments, and that is the other area. It is exactly&#13;
&#13;
because we are a wholesale institution.             That is one of&#13;
&#13;
our comparative advantages.      Our colleagues from UNICEF&#13;
&#13;
say they can run very successful pilot programs and get&#13;
&#13;
them going, but at some point to really scalae them out,&#13;
&#13;
to get national coverage, not to do exactly the same thing&#13;
&#13;
in each part of the country, but to get that approach&#13;
&#13;
scaled out, they need the World Bank involved.&#13;
&#13;
          Finally, some governments are telling us that&#13;
&#13;
this helps them give sort of a stamp of approval to&#13;
&#13;
community-driven development.       It is not just something&#13;
&#13;
that do-gooders go around doing.        It is something that&#13;
&#13;
makes sense.   It helps with social sustainability.           It&#13;
&#13;
helps also build a society that it is going to be easier&#13;
&#13;
for that society to attract foreign investment and so on&#13;
&#13;
because there is a certain sense that the growth is being&#13;
&#13;
shared.&#13;

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
            But it is very important to say that this is not&#13;
&#13;
the newest fad of the day.      I look at development&#13;
&#13;
prospects, and we used to say in the seventies that the&#13;
&#13;
state can do everything; that's how we invested.           Then, in&#13;
&#13;
the eighties, we said the markets can do everything.           I&#13;
&#13;
don't know what we said in the nineties, but it's&#13;
&#13;
certainly clear that there is market failure, there is&#13;
&#13;
state failure, and there is community failure.           We should&#13;
&#13;
not pretend that communities can do everything.&#13;
&#13;
            So all we are saying is that we think we need&#13;
&#13;
this arrow in our quiver.      We do need to be able to move&#13;
&#13;
forward on it.&#13;
&#13;
            There were a couple of other things mentioned on&#13;
&#13;
conflict.    I think exactly where we are going with the&#13;
&#13;
post-conflict work, if you look at the Operational Policy&#13;
&#13;
on conflict prevention and reconstruction, it is very much&#13;
&#13;
that idea of moving upstream.       It is not enough to clean&#13;
&#13;
up, it is not enough to go in there.         But when you do the&#13;
&#13;
cleanup, it is important to look at not just physical&#13;
&#13;
reconstruction, but reconstruction of societies and what&#13;
&#13;
role we can play in that--again, following the lead of&#13;
&#13;
other donor agencies, following the lead of others.           But&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
there is a sense that the Bank also has a role to play in&#13;
&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
         There was also a question raised on why no&#13;
&#13;
social development strategy paper.       Basically, it came&#13;
&#13;
down to budget tradeoffs at the end, that I did not feel&#13;
&#13;
that it was appropriate to spend that amount of money&#13;
&#13;
right now when there were other important deliverables&#13;
&#13;
which we were working with other parts of the Bank on,&#13;
&#13;
such as social impact analysis, the work on the PRSPs.         So&#13;
&#13;
it came down to a tradeoff.&#13;
&#13;
         What we will do is prepare a brief concept paper&#13;
&#13;
that we will take to the CODE Subcommittee, hopefully&#13;
&#13;
soon, but I am not going to make a time-bound commitment&#13;
&#13;
on this one, pending the review in the Bank, so you will&#13;
&#13;
get an idea of where this is head, and then, hopefully,&#13;
&#13;
better times will come.   I think there is another old&#13;
&#13;
American song that describes that.&#13;
&#13;
         Finally, if I may, on rural development, since I&#13;
&#13;
am part of that Network, we are exactly for that reason&#13;
&#13;
rethinking the strategy, and we will be coming back to the&#13;
&#13;
Board with an update of the strategy trying to go through&#13;
&#13;
some of these analyses and what exactly went wrong, or why&#13;
&#13;
didn't it go this way.    Are there other ways that we are&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
supporting rural development, for instance, I think is a&#13;
&#13;
very important point--what is the overall programmatic&#13;
&#13;
lending in support of rural development.          I think the&#13;
&#13;
numbers may not tell the whole story.        That is at least&#13;
&#13;
one important point to make here.&#13;
&#13;
         It is also important to say that to invest in&#13;
&#13;
rural development goes way beyond agriculture.         There is a&#13;
&#13;
lot of sectoral investment that takes place that helps&#13;
&#13;
with rural development.    I think the important point will&#13;
&#13;
be that we will have a chance to discuss that strategy,&#13;
&#13;
but I think that is the point to really take stock.            As&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Piercy said, this was the first sector strategy&#13;
&#13;
presented, and it is the first one where we have four&#13;
&#13;
years of implementation to look back at.          So we look&#13;
&#13;
forward to that discussion.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:     Thanks.&#13;

&#13;
         Jan?&#13;
&#13;
         MS. PIERCY:    [Inaudible comment; no microphone.]&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:     Let's not argue.     Why don't you go&#13;
&#13;
first?&#13;
&#13;
         MR. MEYER:     Sorry, because unfortunately, I have&#13;
&#13;
to leave right away.    I just wanted to, with respect to&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
community development, point to an apparent contribution--&#13;
&#13;
it may not be one in the end, but then, I still think it&#13;
&#13;
is a pretty tough act--which is on the one hand, we have&#13;
&#13;
this big trend of going toward PRSP, and we have the PRSC,&#13;
&#13;
and we have program lending, and we basically approach&#13;
&#13;
countries with global tools and go through the budget&#13;
&#13;
process, give preference to national policies.&#13;
&#13;
         Then, on the other hand, we are now saying we&#13;
&#13;
have to get much more into community development, which is&#13;
&#13;
micro, building things from the bottom, of course with&#13;
&#13;
replication, and at the end, you might have wholesale&#13;
&#13;
again, but at the beginning it is not wholesale, and it is&#13;
&#13;
basically capacity-building.     So we have a huge tension&#13;
&#13;
here in terms of policy, I think, and in terms of where&#13;
&#13;
the vector is really going, and I just wanted to point&#13;
&#13;
this out as one of the things which we somehow in our&#13;
&#13;
strategy will have to deal with.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:   I propose that we have a technical&#13;
&#13;
briefing on this with the policy content; a briefing more&#13;
&#13;
elaborately on how this has been developed in your part of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, and anybody from the Board can then come up with&#13;
&#13;
questions and comments.&#13;

&#13;
            MS. PIERCY:   I want to co me back briefly on the&#13;
&#13;
point about the Social Development Strategy--and I think&#13;
&#13;
it is probably a misnomer to say that would be a sector&#13;
&#13;
strategy.&#13;
&#13;
            The reason I come back--and I certainly take&#13;
&#13;
Steen's point, and that has to be his call--but it is a&#13;
&#13;
point for the colleagues, perhaps.         A couple of years ago,&#13;
&#13;
this was in the pipeline of sector strategies to be&#13;
&#13;
developed. So part of what happens to us on the Board is&#13;
&#13;
you have this false sense of complacency that this is in&#13;
&#13;
hand, and then it falls off the table for budget and other&#13;
&#13;
reasons, and tough tradeoffs do need to be made.&#13;
&#13;
            But we don't necessarily know about it, and that&#13;
&#13;
also may be a point with the Secretariat, because we&#13;
&#13;
assume something, and it changes, and we don't know about&#13;
&#13;
it.   And Steen is actually new in his leadership of this&#13;
&#13;
group; he may not even be aware of prior discussions with&#13;
&#13;
the Board that led us to assume this was being developed.&#13;
&#13;
            The second half of this is a concern I have--and&#13;
&#13;
I hope this will be taken up in the retrospective on&#13;
&#13;
strategies--the hazard in going to this stream of sector&#13;
&#13;
strategies is that we develop specificity and focus more&#13;
&#13;
and more as they have developed, because the Board has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        111&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
demanded to see time-bound plans and budgeting.            So if you&#13;
&#13;
don't have a strategy on a particular area of development,&#13;
&#13;
like social development, the hazard is that it falls off&#13;
&#13;
the table.   And I respect very much the team working on&#13;
&#13;
this.   I know it won't happen.       But I think we really have&#13;
&#13;
to be aware of those issues.&#13;
&#13;
          And then, the second thing is that I didn't hear&#13;
&#13;
in the response any reassurance on the point that Finn&#13;
&#13;
Jonck raised about gender really being embedded into the&#13;
&#13;
baseline diagnostics, but I think that the analysis, the&#13;
&#13;
OED report, was pretty sobering in recognizing how&#13;
&#13;
extensively we have failed to do so and the implications&#13;
&#13;
for our effectiveness in education and poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
across the board.&#13;
&#13;
          Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. STEK:    John?&#13;
&#13;
          MR. PAGE:    Just to reassure Jan, the Gender&#13;
&#13;
Strategy paper makes the point that this should be done&#13;
&#13;
uniformly across countries.       We anticipate, especially, I&#13;
&#13;
think, as we rethink what our poverty analysis/poverty&#13;
&#13;
assessment work should be, that that could be a locus for&#13;
&#13;
much of the gender work.       I talked with Karen about this,&#13;
&#13;
and I think that may embody it.         She is of the view,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       112&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
rather, as we have just discussed in terms of poverty&#13;
&#13;
assessments, that the point is to get the work done, not&#13;
&#13;
so much to count individual gender analyses or gender&#13;
&#13;
assessments, and we'll make sure that that happens.&#13;
&#13;
          To come back on Matthias' point, I would almost&#13;
&#13;
turn his concern into an advantage.        The more I work with&#13;
&#13;
the Fund, the more I realize the great strength of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank as a multi-product firm, and the fact that we are a&#13;
&#13;
multi-product firm really poses a challenge, but it also&#13;
&#13;
poses an enormous opportunity to both go wholesale in some&#13;
&#13;
cases, and specific and community-level in other cases.&#13;
&#13;
the real issue is the nature of the Country Assistance&#13;
&#13;
Strategy and how coherent that is--not to focus on any one&#13;
&#13;
instrument, whether it is a PRSC or community-driven&#13;
&#13;
development, or indeed, even analytical            and advisory&#13;
&#13;
work.   It is both a challenge and a great opportunity for&#13;
&#13;
us to be able to bring and deploy those various kinds of&#13;
&#13;
instruments together in a consistent way.&#13;
&#13;
          Let me turn to the question of empowerment,&#13;
&#13;
because we have several issues here.        I will deal with&#13;
&#13;
timing and let Deepa talk a little bit about where she&#13;
&#13;
stands are the moment with respect to the work.&#13;

&#13;
         We intend to have a draft available for&#13;
&#13;
Management review by the end of this fiscal year, which is&#13;
&#13;
to say this month. Our senior Management and I think all&#13;
&#13;
of us feel that because this is an important issue and one&#13;
&#13;
that is going to be difficult and perhaps in some cases&#13;
&#13;
contentious, we need to take the fullest possible time&#13;
&#13;
needed both within Management and among staff to consult&#13;
&#13;
and to review and then to have sufficient time to consult&#13;
&#13;
and review with the Board.&#13;
&#13;
         So I cannot predict to you when it will be&#13;
&#13;
coming to you, but I would say fairly early in the new&#13;
&#13;
fiscal year, we will be coming to you with a draft of this&#13;
&#13;
that has been cleared by the full Management review&#13;
&#13;
process, and we won't try to rush that process in any&#13;
&#13;
respect, but we do intend to bring that staff guidance on&#13;
&#13;
empowerment of the poor to the Board.         It is in your work&#13;
&#13;
program, as you have seen.     I think it is scheduled for&#13;
&#13;
the first quarter of next fiscal year, and I suspect that&#13;
&#13;
toward the end of the first quarter is when we would be&#13;
&#13;
coming to you with it.&#13;
&#13;
         Deepa?&#13;

                          (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      114&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         Let me just talk a little bit about the process&#13;
&#13;
that we have gone through, because this is an issue that&#13;
&#13;
we feel is critically related to both achieving economic&#13;
&#13;
growth as well as for poverty reduction and to signal that&#13;
&#13;
this is an approach or a lens through which we look, it is&#13;
&#13;
a process that cuts across sectors and levels from the&#13;
&#13;
macro down to the community level.&#13;
&#13;
         Nick Stern has been providing leadership and&#13;
&#13;
chairing the committee or the group that is doing the&#13;
&#13;
work.&#13;
&#13;
         It is also strongly linked to both social&#13;
&#13;
development issues as well as poverty reduction, so the&#13;
&#13;
co-chairs are John Page and Steen from Social Development;&#13;
&#13;
but it is a cross-Network effort.      So we are working&#13;
&#13;
closely with the Private Sector Development group, with&#13;
&#13;
Rural Development, with Infrastructure, as well as with&#13;
&#13;
the Social Development people.&#13;
&#13;
         What we have done so far is rather than writing&#13;
&#13;
a paper here, I spent about a month going to the field,&#13;
&#13;
particularly in East Asia, Philippines,           Vietnam as well&#13;
&#13;
as Indonesia, to learn from the field and to start with&#13;
&#13;
some very simple questions of what does empowerment mean&#13;
&#13;
and is there a local term for empowerment.          From that is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     115&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
emerging a consensus that it is very clear that there is&#13;
&#13;
no single institutional model for empowerment.         This has&#13;
&#13;
to be very context-specific; it depends upon the&#13;
&#13;
political, social, and economic environment as well as the&#13;
&#13;
laws of the country.&#13;
&#13;
          From this, we have distilled basically four&#13;
&#13;
principles or four elements of empowerment that we see&#13;
&#13;
coming out of both practice as well as theory that we feel&#13;
&#13;
that if we apply this or push the frontiers on this, it&#13;
&#13;
will lead to empowerment of poor people and other excluded&#13;
&#13;
groups.&#13;
&#13;
          The four principles that there seems to be a&#13;
&#13;
convergence around are, first, access to information;&#13;
&#13;
second, inclusion and participation; third,&#13;
&#13;
accountability; and fourth, investment in local&#13;
&#13;
organizational capacity.&#13;
&#13;
          None of this is new in the Bank.         As you have&#13;
&#13;
heard, a lot of work is actually happening in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
So we see this paper as bringing together the different&#13;
&#13;
strands across sectors particularly related to governance,&#13;
&#13;
to decentralization, to public sector reform, as well as&#13;
&#13;
to access to basic services and private sector&#13;
&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     116&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         So we are looking at empowerment broadly both in&#13;
&#13;
terms of voice and representation, but also in terms of&#13;
&#13;
economic empowerment, because without economic&#13;
&#13;
opportunity, voice and representation are meaningless.&#13;
&#13;
         So the paper will have examples of if you look&#13;
&#13;
at our CAS intervention strategies through the empowerment&#13;
&#13;
lens, what would you do differently.       So it will be&#13;
&#13;
bringing together not best practices but ongoing examples.&#13;
&#13;
But to keep the paper brief, we will have about 30 to 35&#13;
&#13;
pages of the main paper and about 15 annexes which build&#13;
&#13;
on practice so that it provides people with guidance.&#13;
&#13;
         The challenge is when you are saying everything&#13;
&#13;
is context-specific, and there are no models, what are the&#13;
&#13;
principles that you can highlight.       We are still&#13;
&#13;
struggling with that and will come to you soon.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. PAGE:   Sven would remind me if he were here&#13;
&#13;
that a central element of this, of course, is to think&#13;
&#13;
about the Bank's comparative advantage within its mandate&#13;
&#13;
in this area and recognize that there are others who may&#13;
&#13;
be able to address many of these issues, both in a&#13;
&#13;
different environment and with a different level of&#13;
&#13;
comparative advantage.&#13;

                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       117&#13;

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
            So one of the things, as we think about&#13;
&#13;
operational guidance and taking these principles into&#13;
&#13;
practice, is to think very specifically about what we can&#13;
&#13;
and should do as opposed to what we might wish to do but&#13;
&#13;
ought not to.&#13;
&#13;
            As a final intervention,      if we could ask&#13;
&#13;
Shahrokh to talk a little bit about the work that DEC has&#13;
&#13;
been doing on trying to bring together some of our country&#13;
&#13;
practice with the IDGS and this issue of what will it take&#13;
&#13;
us to get there as a community.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. FARDOUST:   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            I am Shahrokh Fardoust, and I am an economic&#13;
&#13;
advisor in the office of the Chief Economist of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
            I believe Nick Stern briefed CODE several weeks&#13;
&#13;
ago on the work that we are doing on IDGs, and I am sure&#13;
&#13;
this will continue in the next few months as we are making&#13;
&#13;
progress in the work that we are leading within the Bank&#13;
&#13;
and also in very close collaboration with our development&#13;
&#13;
partners.&#13;
&#13;
            Basically, the framework that we have taken as&#13;
&#13;
the basis of our work is that the Bank has a major stake&#13;
&#13;
in using the development goals as a means of sharpening&#13;
&#13;
the poverty focus of the Bank's work in the pursuit of&#13;
&#13;

                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     118&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
those widely shared aspirations which are embodied in the&#13;
&#13;
goals to which all countries and now all international&#13;
&#13;
agencies and donors are fully committed.&#13;
&#13;
         Two is to encourage a unified approach among all&#13;
&#13;
international agencies so that the Bank will be operating&#13;
&#13;
within a coherent framework, a multilateral framework,&#13;
&#13;
that is effective and not fragmented.&#13;
&#13;
         And third is strengthening donor coordination at&#13;
&#13;
the country level so that aid effectiveness is&#13;
&#13;
significantly enhanced and less open to doubt and&#13;
&#13;
criticism.&#13;
&#13;
         As a first step to enhanced partnership in the&#13;
&#13;
area of those International Development Goals, we&#13;
&#13;
organized a technical seminar in late March this year&#13;
&#13;
where we invited all international agencies, all bilateral&#13;
&#13;
donors, and about 19 developing country experts through&#13;
&#13;
the GDN Network to come to the Bank and discuss basic&#13;
&#13;
issues such as data, measurement, and benchmarking on the&#13;
&#13;
goals, and also get a much better understanding of the&#13;
&#13;
relationship of the International Goals with the&#13;
&#13;
Millennium Declaration   Goals.    As you know, the&#13;
&#13;
International Development Goals are based on various UN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                  Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                         (202) 546-6666&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                             DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
conferences, and they are a subset of the Millennium&#13;
&#13;
Declaration Goals.&#13;
&#13;
         But in order to be able to monitor, to measure,&#13;
&#13;
and to collaborate better from a statistical point of view&#13;
&#13;
as well as on policies, we thought that this was a good&#13;
&#13;
first step, and I think it was highly successful.&#13;
&#13;
         We prepared a short note which I believe has&#13;
&#13;
been distributed to Board members for information.&#13;
&#13;
         We have also started realigning the research&#13;
&#13;
within DEC in a number of ways that would basically try to&#13;
&#13;
address the key issues regarding the policies that are&#13;
&#13;
needed especially the country level to accelerate progress&#13;
&#13;
in achieving the goals, and also a much better&#13;
&#13;
understanding of linkages between growth process and the&#13;
&#13;
various dimensions of poverty which are embodied in the&#13;
&#13;
goals, and interlinkages between them.&#13;
&#13;
         In addition to this, as a result of the seminar&#13;
&#13;
and our discussions with our partners and also widely&#13;
&#13;
within the Bank among the technical staff, we have reached&#13;
&#13;
the conclusion that in order to get a better understanding&#13;
&#13;
of the resource needs of the countries, in order to&#13;
&#13;
accelerate their efforts in achieving the goals, there is&#13;
&#13;
a need for country-level studies in the context of the&#13;

&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
existing dialogue and so forth.         It is not additional&#13;
&#13;
work, but sharpening the work of research at the country&#13;
&#13;
level, especially the countries where they have lagged&#13;
&#13;
behind in achieving the goals over the past number of&#13;
&#13;
years and in fact are going in the wrong direction toward&#13;
&#13;
not only the poverty goals but other dimensions in health&#13;
&#13;
and education.&#13;
&#13;
         Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:     Thank you.      Thank you for that.      I&#13;
&#13;
think an important point that we don't always hear so&#13;
&#13;
explicitly is how the linkage of what we want to do is&#13;
&#13;
also connected with the organization of the department&#13;
&#13;
that does it.    I think that is very important to keep in&#13;
&#13;
mind.&#13;
&#13;
         Can I sum up?       I will do that--and we have&#13;
&#13;
talked about this--more and more briefly, so don't feel&#13;
&#13;
hurt if you don't recognize what you said in what I am&#13;
&#13;
going to say now.    It is going to be very short, but the&#13;
&#13;
crucial point is, of course, that you will have to find&#13;
&#13;
back what you found important in the statement--this time&#13;
&#13;
it is a statement and not a green sheet, because it is in&#13;
&#13;
the Board next week.&#13;

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                              DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
         So this is the summing up.         I myself would like&#13;
&#13;
to start, though, by recalling what Jan said about the&#13;
&#13;
enormous improvement that has taken place in the field of&#13;
&#13;
poverty analysis and framing of the strategy in terms of&#13;
&#13;
concreteness of implementation.       I think there is a sea&#13;
&#13;
change even since I came in; she came in before that, and&#13;
&#13;
she came in several years after the WDR of 1990.          So I&#13;
&#13;
think that is something to keep very firmly in mind, how&#13;
&#13;
serious the intent is at the moment of doing things,&#13;
&#13;
really, and bring them into practice.&#13;
&#13;
         Members welcomed the two reports, appreciated&#13;
&#13;
the quality and, as I just said, the major improvements in&#13;
&#13;
focus and coherence of the strategy for poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
as well as the focus on implementation.&#13;
&#13;
         The discussion was thoughtful and penetrating.&#13;
&#13;
We touched on many points which will be covered in the&#13;
&#13;
statement.   Many members spoke of the importance of growth&#13;
&#13;
and effective implementation at the country level.&#13;
&#13;
Members supported Management's recommendations that the&#13;
&#13;
two reports be combined into one for dissemination.          That&#13;
&#13;
is part of the streamlining proposals.&#13;
&#13;
         The main points raised by members--and this is&#13;
&#13;
very selective--the need was mentioned by several of us&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
for the broad poverty reduction strategy, the poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction approach, I should say, to adapt to country&#13;
&#13;
circumstances, the importance of monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
evaluation, of strong analytical work and capacity-&#13;
&#13;
building.    The need was mentioned to strengthen&#13;
&#13;
accountability for monitoring progress and implementation&#13;
&#13;
at the country level.&#13;
&#13;
            Also, there was a concern that the guidance for&#13;
&#13;
empowerment in Bank operations appropriately address&#13;
&#13;
institutional development and take into account potential&#13;
&#13;
risks for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
            Members asked that Management aim to have an&#13;
&#13;
integrated program or perhaps a timebound set of next&#13;
&#13;
steps in future updates.     We heard just now, by the way,&#13;
&#13;
what we may expect; not everything will be timebound, but&#13;
&#13;
I hope that we will achieve a greater degree of&#13;
&#13;
concreteness in some respects by the time of the Board&#13;
&#13;
meeting.&#13;
&#13;
            Also, this concreteness was a desire on the&#13;
&#13;
resource implications of what we are doing, including&#13;
&#13;
analysis and M and E, and while I understood the response&#13;
&#13;
to say, look, why don't you look at the budget, and why&#13;
&#13;
don't you realize that a lot of this has been taken up by&#13;
&#13;

all kinds of sectors in the Bank, regions, sectors, et&#13;
&#13;
cetera, nonetheless it would be helpful if some of this&#13;
&#13;
were brought out explicitly, if possible. I would welcome&#13;
&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
         Then, we will prepare a statement from the chair&#13;
&#13;
and will circulate the opening statements which were found&#13;
&#13;
valuable by members.&#13;
&#13;
         I am not really going to ask you to react to&#13;
&#13;
this unless you have a feeling that something really&#13;
&#13;
should have been mentioned now, which you are afraid would&#13;
&#13;
otherwise not come into the statement.&#13;
&#13;
         Finn?&#13;
&#13;
         MR. JONCK:      I didn't hear a reference to the&#13;
&#13;
agreement that we had, I think, on the need for further&#13;
&#13;
strengthen the impact and output measuring in the future&#13;
&#13;
progress reports.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. STEK:     That was an important point which&#13;
&#13;
will obviously come into the statement; absolutely--but&#13;
&#13;
there is lots more.&#13;
&#13;
         Greg?&#13;
&#13;
         MR. INGRAM:      Just a comment, and that is with&#13;
&#13;
respect to issues of CDD and empowerment, we have&#13;
&#13;
delivered a Review of Participation to CODE which we have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       124&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                               DO NOT REPRODUCE&#13;
&#13;
to discuss.   We are about to deliver an evaluation of&#13;
&#13;
social funds.   Both of these are related to these topics.&#13;
&#13;
CODE might want to consider discussing those two at the&#13;
&#13;
same time.    But I just wanted to call your attention to&#13;
&#13;
the fact that there is material that is quite relevant to&#13;
&#13;
the issues you were concerned about which is on its way--&#13;
&#13;
or here.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STEK:   Right.    It sounds as if it should be&#13;
&#13;
on the agenda quite soon, and the agenda is quite full,&#13;
&#13;
but we will discuss with Secretariat how to deal with&#13;
&#13;
that.   It is also important that we do deal with it.&#13;
&#13;
           Is that enough on this subject?&#13;
&#13;
           Then, many thanks to all those who participated&#13;
&#13;
and also for the very clear exposition by Management and&#13;
&#13;
by OED.&#13;
&#13;
           Is there any other business?&#13;
&#13;
           [No response.]&#13;
&#13;
           MR. STEK:   There is no other business.&#13;
&#13;
           Then, we next meet on June 20 to discuss&#13;
&#13;
"Information and Communication Technologies Sector&#13;
&#13;
Strategy Paper."   The meeting is adjourned.          Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           [Whereupon, at 1:01 p.m., the Committee was&#13;
&#13;
concluded.]&#13;
