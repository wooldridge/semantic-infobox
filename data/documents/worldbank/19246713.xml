&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur, The World Bank:&#13;
Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1997. It is not a formal&#13;
oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the person interviewed. At times&#13;
the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at&#13;
other times they talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview&#13;
tapes and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives&#13;
believes that this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public&#13;
use.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                                       2&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]1&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . so I have seen it. It's been awhile since I've read it, but I read your review of the&#13;
whole experience, but there were just some things that I wanted to sort of get filled in or get your&#13;
reflections on. First of all, when did you, how did you come aboard at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, one is never quite sure about these things, but I think it all started with a&#13;
talk I gave at Montreaux in Switzerland.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: And Ed [Edwin M.] Martin was the chairman of the DAC [Development&#13;
Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]. .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: . . and I was the vice president in charge of the Development Center.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: And he had one of these Tidewater meetings.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: The heads of all the aid agencies were there, including Robert McNamara. And&#13;
Martin asked me to come along and give a chat on the research we were doing at the&#13;
Development Center which included--which was focusing on the impact of the population and&#13;
the demographic increases and what this meant for the labor force. This is 25 years ago; no one&#13;
was really looking at this.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: So I gave this talk, and McNamara was in the audience. And afterwards--the&#13;
main thrust of my talk, as you know, was agricultural policies and preparing for the changed&#13;
circumstances in Dakar and that it was no good to help pushing policies that involved large-scale&#13;
mechanization, the displacement of rural people. So afterwards McNamara came to me and said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Well, we don't do that kind of thing at the World Bank. We donâ&#128;&#153;t--we support large-scale&#13;
mechanization.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I said, â&#128;&#156;Well, I think you're wrong.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
He said, â&#128;&#156;Do you really believe in plot farming?â&#128;&#157;&#13;

                                           Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                        September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, â&#128;&#156;Yes,â&#128;&#157; you know, because I'd seen what was coming out of the pipeline at the Rockefeller&#13;
Foundation and elsewhere, where I had worked before.&#13;
&#13;
And then he asked if he could see a manuscript I had that was written by David Turnham, which&#13;
was the first product of the Development Center on this issue, which dealt with population&#13;
growth and employment. And much to my surprise--it was a manuscript--he read the whole&#13;
damned thing. He gave it to me the next morning and said he enjoyed reading it and that there--&#13;
but there were some (I learned something from that) that there were some mistakes on page 72&#13;
[laughter], one of the footnotes or something like that. Well, that impressed me.&#13;
&#13;
Then he asked me what I was going to do when I left OECD [Organization for Economic Co-&#13;
operation and Development] because he said he was worried about agriculture at the Bank. I&#13;
said, well, I hadn't really decided yet. When I came back to Washington I got in touch with the&#13;
people at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, you left OECD?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: My term expired.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Your term expired. I see.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Just before it expired I received a number of offers, and I decided that the Bank&#13;
sounded a bit interesting because Iâ&#128;&#153;d already done a couple of consultancies with them. And I&#13;
was offered the job as advisor--I don't know how all this worked--as advisor to the agriculture&#13;
department, but the rural development--because they said the president wanted to do something&#13;
about rural development. The reorganization was taking place, and in the shuffle that took place&#13;
I became the director.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: But I was told that the president wanted somebody, you know, who thought&#13;
beyond the purely technical aspects of agriculture. And then when I got to know McNamara--as&#13;
I got to know him quite well--he told me that he was very concerned about what he called the&#13;
colonial aspects of, the colonial approach that was taken by the Bank's agriculture department. It&#13;
was too much â&#128;&#156;enclave development,â&#128;&#157; as he described it, and he wanted a much more broad-&#13;
based approach and he wanted an approach that could reach the large number, the larger numbers&#13;
of farmers, and then subsequently he wanted an approach that could really deal with the poor.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: So that's how I came.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right. Uh-huh. This, the â&#128;&#156;ex-colonialist enclave approach,â&#128;&#157; who was he thinking&#13;
about there?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, I think historically what happened at the Bank was the only people that&#13;
&#13;
                                   Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
knew anything about tropical agriculture from developed countries were the Dutch--and they&#13;
were a diminishing numberâ&#128;&#148;the British and the French.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: And so the most of the people who applied for jobs at the Bank in agriculture&#13;
came out of colonial services. They brought a lot of that kind of tradition with them.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah. What was your--now, he said the Bank at that time, when you talked to&#13;
him in Montreaux, that they were going for large-scale, mechanized agriculture. They had made&#13;
loans for mechanization back in the â&#128;&#152;50s . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . but I've been getting kind of impressed with what a major change [George D.]&#13;
Woods managed to make in agriculture in . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, I think that what happened in the Woods era was that theâ&#128;&#148;I take the view&#13;
that the economists began to prevail over the engineers, and in the Woods era there were&#13;
widening horizons. But I think Woods wasn't there very long.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, heâ&#128;&#153;s five years and then . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . and he made this sort of monumental paper before the Board [of Executive&#13;
Directors] in January of â&#128;&#152;64 where he said, â&#128;&#156;We've got to do a lot more,â&#128;&#157; and he talked about&#13;
even agrarian reform. And--but there was quite a beefing up of commitments, although thereâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
this--I want to ask you about the water side because irrigation and drainage dominated&#13;
everything else that they were doing.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, becauseâ&#128;&#148;thatâ&#128;&#153;s for two reasons. One, that's the engineering approach.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: In the Woods era or the pre-Woods era very few people knew anything about&#13;
the process of agricultural development.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: How do you invest in agricultural development? They were still focusing on&#13;
capital, investment in capital, you know, concrete, machines, things like this. My view is that it&#13;
was--that there was change, that they were seeing, you know, they were seeing that there had to&#13;
be change. The sector paper that [Stephen D.] Eccles and a couple of other people did show that&#13;
there was a need for change. They beefed up the agricultural numbers and--but it was&#13;
McNamara who really pushed it, but he changed it in one very significant way--two significant.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McNamara had two or three goals that were articulated in the 1973 Nairobi speech, which was&#13;
the watershed as far as I was concerned, although things were in train already. One was, of&#13;
course, to increase lending for agriculture. He concluded, helped by Mahbub ul-Haq and myself,&#13;
that agriculture was, that agriculture was the most important sector in the third world at large so&#13;
the Bank had to increase its lending for agriculture. Secondly, he was very concerned about the&#13;
fact that a large subsector of agriculture was being bypassed, I mean the small farmers, and by&#13;
then he knew that small farmer productivity could be raised because of the Indian experience.&#13;
And we went in very strongly to support small farmer agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Third--excuse me--the point, the point that the big change was not only the&#13;
increase in the agriculture but who benefited from it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: That was the big change. That may have been a very narrow view but . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I have been thinking--until late last week, I guess--that there wasn't much going on in&#13;
agriculture in the Bank up until after Woods came, and that's really what [Edward S.] Mason-&#13;
[Robert E.] Asher says, for example, and that then agriculture was kind of bootlegged into the&#13;
Bank almost by the [Bernard R.] Bell Mission and Jack [John G.] Crawford.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And, and that that was . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, not in the Bank as such, but I mean they made India the big client of&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, and they--but if you read the section on agriculture in the [Lester B.] Pearson&#13;
Commission Report, which is after all, I think, reflects the almost pre-McNamara period because&#13;
it's just a sort of standard operating â&#128;&#156;green revolutionâ&#128;&#157; discussion. It's all growth-oriented. Itâ&#128;&#153;s-&#13;
-itâ&#128;&#153;s very much small scale; I mean itâ&#128;&#153;s the biological-chemical-technology-oriented. What it's&#13;
not is equity-oriented.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: No, of course.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It's growth.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And that, I would say, is the sort of Crawford kind of version.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, that's right, but if you look at that piece I wrote for the World's Resources&#13;
[Institute], youâ&#128;&#153;ll see I focused on four stages in agriculture. One was the neglect of agriculture&#13;
&#13;
                                     Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                  September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
at the beginning. The second was the export-oriented growth aspectâ&#128;&#148;sorry, second was the&#13;
heavy emphasis on the capital and the infrastructure. Third was growth, you know, much more&#13;
concern about the biological-chemical, and fourth was equity.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. I'll have to go back and read your piece again. I really have read it, but my&#13;
memory's short.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: But I think that what happens, too, is thereâ&#128;&#153;s a time, you know--it takes time for&#13;
ideas to seep through and for action, the pipeline, and there's a long lead time. For instance, the&#13;
lending for agriculture peaked after McNamara left the Bank, but that was in the period when his&#13;
build-up that he instituted was still--its forward momentum was going on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right, right. Now, how would you characterize in agriculture, agriculture/rural&#13;
development area, the key content, really, of this shift toward equity? I mean it was--I know that&#13;
you were sort of tagged with smallholder farming, but, as we just said, the green revolution&#13;
technology actually focused on smallholders. What was different?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, I'll tell you what was different. What happened was the president was&#13;
very keen on doing something about poverty.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Okay, so we explored all the avenues, how you could do something about&#13;
poverty, and we really, we concluded that by and large, at least at that stage of the game, that the&#13;
Bank was very limited in what it could do about the really poor, who were the lame and the old&#13;
and the young and the sick, et cetera, et cetera, as well as the urban unemployed and the growing&#13;
number of underemployed and the growing number of landless in the rural areas. But what we&#13;
did think of was, what we did believe, was that we could help people who had an asset, land, so&#13;
the great focus became on trying to help those people who had a piece of land, small farmers,&#13;
and then they were kind of--you know, we pushed very hard that this attention had to be given to&#13;
that group.&#13;
&#13;
The whole business about the rural development thing was that when McNamara concluded,&#13;
helped by others, that the big problem was rural poverty, and he thought the big issue, then, you&#13;
had to do something about rural development. But rural development and rural poverty were&#13;
synonymous in his mind. It wasn't the kind of concept of integrated rural development that&#13;
people talked very much about. It was rural development equals the alleviation of rural poverty.&#13;
The notion of integrated rural development, which was tried on a very limited scale, I might say,&#13;
although people made a big fuss about it, was an attempt to try and deal with the whole issue on&#13;
a limited basis, dealing with the other requirements, health and education and so forth. But it&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t--it's become a focal point of a lot of criticism, but it was a very marginal, very, very&#13;
marginal aspect of the whole program. And, unfortunately, where it was tried was where the&#13;
needs were greatest, and that was in Africa, parts of Africa, and that's where it failed.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, I want to chase that down some more, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: The hard thing thatâ&#128;&#148;that I think is that you've got to understand something&#13;
about the mechanism of the Bank. You know, the president is very powerful.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, we know that, yes.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Okay, so the difference was that McNamara made it a personal interest.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: And so he pushed people, and I pushed the division chiefs, â&#128;&#156;This is what you've&#13;
got to do,â&#128;&#157; and et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay. A whole set of questions. One is, you just now mentioned, I wanted to explore.&#13;
After reorganization you were in this--in a sense--staff department, but you had these operating&#13;
and regional, so how were your relations with them? Then there's the question of the landless,&#13;
and I just want to sort of get a, take a sounding with you as to what the feeling was about land&#13;
reform. There had been a lot of talk about land reform earlier on. And then the question of the&#13;
president's inner circle, sort of, the innovators. What kind of relations did you have with&#13;
Mahbub, with Hollis [Chenery] and some of them--were you tight in that group?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, I'll tell you about the beginnings of this program.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: The whole poverty orientation, at least operationally, in order to launch a&#13;
program about rural development we called a--we assembled a group of people from all over the&#13;
world, India [inaudible] you know, some of the names of the â&#128;&#152;50s and â&#128;&#152;60s, and we discussed the&#13;
rural development approach. The meeting was chaired by [F. M.] Scherer, and Ian Mason was&#13;
there, and the idea was, you know, is it feasible? Should we go ahead with this? And the&#13;
meeting came to the conclusion that, yes, there was merit in this. So McNamara wanted, asked&#13;
me to write a report with [Louis J.] Walinsky.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Lou Walinsky?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Lou Walinsky. And we did write a report saying, yes, we could do something&#13;
about rural development and the Bank should move in this area into a poverty orientation. He&#13;
called a meeting to discuss the report with Burke Knapp and the vice presidents--I'm not sure if&#13;
they were--yes, they were vice presidents--and they weren't terribly keen. They didn't see any&#13;
reason why there should be special emphasis. You know, they felt it was too difficult. They&#13;
felt, you know, this wasn't in their purview, so to speak. There was some resistance. In my&#13;
view--and I qualify this, in my view--McNamara got pretty angry, and he turned to me and said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Well, you create a central unit to implement this policy.â&#128;&#157; Now, that was just when the Bank had&#13;
been decentralized. So in the agricultural department, which was a staff department, we had an&#13;
operating division, the rural development division, which was started under the direction of Leif&#13;
Christoffersen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Who?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Leif Christoffersen.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: That was one of--that created friction, of course, and that created problems&#13;
because the operating power had been shifted to the regions.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And so this was an operating unit . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . that could generate projects and such?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, but it was very--it had a very tough row to hoe because there was a lot of&#13;
resistance to it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did that continue for a long time?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, yeah, it did. And it grew, but it took on some very, very difficult projects.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is that partly why this problem of defining what is rural development arose, to divide&#13;
the turf between that unit and the regional?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, I think that--no, I think the definition--the definition was my problem, my&#13;
fault. If Iâ&#128;&#153;d simply called it â&#128;&#156;poverty oriented agriculture,â&#128;&#157; we would have had no problems, but&#13;
because the president wanted a thrust of rural development, then we said, â&#128;&#156;Well, rural&#13;
development is this, that, and the other, as said in the Rural Development Policy Paper.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see, I see. That's . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: It got convoluted. You know, if weâ&#128;&#153;d just said, â&#128;&#156;Look, the focus is on helping&#13;
small farmers, helping low income people in agriculture,â&#128;&#157; that could have been much more clear.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: At least 50 percent of the beneficiaries . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, right. That became--but then we had to go into all these damned&#13;
convolutions about--you know, because there was a lot of resistance. People said, â&#128;&#156;How can you&#13;
isolate the small farmers, you know, if it's an area concept or if itâ&#128;&#153;s is a rural credit program?â&#128;&#157;,&#13;
you know, and anyway, most of the--as I told you, most of the people, most of the old hands just&#13;
didn't believe it. They didn't believe that you could help small farmers. They believed that this&#13;
was a lot of nonsense; you're just pouring money down a rat hole.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: One thing that John has said--I wanted to get a sense as to why, when the emphasis&#13;
was so much on rural poverty and yet operationally in the agricultural strategy the emphasis&#13;
turned out to be on small farmers, but at the same time even then there was the awareness that in&#13;
Asia in particular and probably, you know, in Africa but also parts of Latin America, the poorest&#13;
of the poor were the landless. So what was the . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: You're running ahead of things. Remember that at the time I'm talking about&#13;
you couldn't say, â&#128;&#156;Yes, we know how to deal with small farmers. We can deal with one part of&#13;
the problem.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I see.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Because--years later, I remember, I went to a seminar at IFRI [Institut francais&#13;
des relations internationales] or somewhere and heard Michael Lipton say, â&#128;&#156;Well, it's no longer&#13;
a small farmer problem. It's now a problem of the landless.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible] going down now?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, because we didn't--the way that we were structured, agricultural&#13;
department dealt with agriculture. I mean, in dealing with the poorest people, as far as&#13;
agriculture was concerned, as I said before, we realized (back in India and elsewhere) that what&#13;
we knew best and what we could do best was to help people that had an asset, they had some&#13;
land, help them become more productive. But at the same time there was a very heavy increase&#13;
in investment in research and things like that.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah. You know, to sort of reinforce Marty, if you think about India, this is what&#13;
[inaudible] was at in about '69, the small and marginal farmer program.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right [both talking at once], thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That you canâ&#128;&#153;t get down to the littlest farmers. But rural development, one would&#13;
think of it in some sense extending beyond agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, it did, we did, but it was in a very limited way. And, of course what, what&#13;
we did try these projects--unfortunately, as I said, many of them were in Africa--in which we&#13;
tried to incorporate them, in Brazil, in northeast Brazil, and so forth, we tried to incorporate&#13;
health components and education components, water, medical posts, things like that. Now, those&#13;
kind--many of those projects were done by, initially by--these multi-sector projects were done by&#13;
the unit that was in my department, the â&#128;&#156;new-style projectsâ&#128;&#157; they were called, and many of them&#13;
didn't work because of the problems of administration and the difficulties we ran into.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What was your perception of the moveability of the whole land and tenure thing when&#13;
you joined the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, I think the Bank was very, very conservative on this issue. Now, you&#13;
recall that in the early papers they talked about agrarian reform.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: It wasn't land reform. I was on the World Bank's first agricultural mission in&#13;
1956 as a consultant. It was to Colombia.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Uh-huh, I knew you had worked there.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: We went down--and by the way, if you read [Lauchlin B.] Currie's report on&#13;
Colombia, you'll find that all the things he talked about in 1956 are still the things that we're&#13;
talking about today, including land reform and all the rest of it. And I remember that mission&#13;
very well because there was a tremendous land use problem in Colombia, as you may well know.&#13;
The indigenous population were farming on the sides of mountains producing food--I mean, this&#13;
is a caricature--but the valley bottoms were occupied by the large cattle-owners, the reverse of&#13;
what was rational. And there was a great debate among ourselves about what we could do about&#13;
it. And there was some suggestion, you know, that there should be land--the government should&#13;
take the lead in redistributing land and so forth, but we eventually ended up by suggesting that&#13;
there should be taxation policies that would put pressure on the people in the valley bottoms to&#13;
intensify land use.&#13;
&#13;
This notion of not getting into the redistribution of land was reinforced when we returned&#13;
because we were--the mission was ostensibly an independent mission, but we reported to Mr.&#13;
[Robert L.] Garner . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: . . the vice president, and he made it quite plain, â&#128;&#156;None of that stuff.â&#128;&#157; He made&#13;
it quite plain that it was beyond our--that this was a political issue, and it was not, and it was not-&#13;
-the Bank wasn't to get involved in these kinds of things.&#13;
&#13;
Years later when I went back to Colombia it was--the notion of having differential taxes, in fact,&#13;
the idea that was developed was an imputed income tax.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: It was very fanciful. The chief economist on the mission was a guy from the&#13;
Federal Reserve Board in New York, and he came up with this idea about imputed income taxes,&#13;
you know, good value land, if it wasn't being used, at least it should be taxed as though it was&#13;
being used. And in theory it was fine, but I mean, it was politically naive and technically very&#13;
difficult to do. And years later they still haven't done anything.&#13;
&#13;
But you see what happened with the rural development program--this is one of the criticisms of&#13;
helping the small farmers, especially in Latin America--we worked around them. We supported&#13;
a very big program in Colombia called, I think it was called INCORA [Instituto Colombiano de&#13;
la Reforma Agraria] --I'm not sure if that's the right acronym--which was a successful rural&#13;
development program, but the large landholders were left intact. And we moved into the&#13;
&#13;
                                     Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                  September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
mountains, we supported the government's program in the mountains, putting in roads, making&#13;
credit available, helping with the marketing of potatoes and so forth. And that was the&#13;
difference. When I went to Colombia in 1956, we wrote this report. Out of that report came a&#13;
project for the importation of tractors to help the larger farmers. Twenty years later the focus&#13;
was on what can you do for these people on the sides of the hills without redistributing land, or&#13;
where you were developing under-utilized land you have land settlement programs.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: With McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s approach to land reform, how did he . . . [Both talking at the same&#13;
time]&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Oh, I think he knew how difficult it was. But there . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Had he ever approached the issue?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: I can't, I canâ&#128;&#153;t answer that. I mean, I am not, I can't speak for him on this.&#13;
Except that, I know that he warned--I know that in my presence he warned one or two national&#13;
leaders in quite a forthright way that unless something was done about the land situation, it&#13;
would be extremely difficult, you know, that the political consequences and the economic&#13;
consequences would be very serious. And that happened in Ethiopia. It happened in one or two&#13;
other places. I was there when it happened.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Before the coup?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, before the coup.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I would say the conventional wisdom at that time was that it was terribly important but&#13;
you couldn't do a hell of a lot about it in most situations politically. And, in fact, I've been&#13;
surprised, in Woods' early papers he speaks as though he's on for some--at least very close&#13;
support for land reform. I don't think it ever happened very much in his term.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: But let me say one thing. It was--in the '60s was when there was a very&#13;
powerful sentiment, especially with regard to Latin America, that you had to do something about&#13;
land reform. And Tom Carroll and--there were a whole group of people who . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, yes, that's true. It was very much differentiated regionally, yes.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, there was a whole group of people who pushed this very hard. It was&#13;
pushed in the Alliance for Progress, too, but it stumbled. You know, there wasn't the follow-&#13;
through. Now, there was a great concern about land reform technically, you know, disturbing&#13;
production and so forth, and there was a lot of distrust about it. It was seen as a sort of political&#13;
way of helping the have-nots, but it would have very bad economic consequences.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: We did have problems in the Bank with Brazil, for instance, over some of the&#13;
publications about land distribution, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                  September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So in summary I would say that there were mixed feelings about land reform. The old, older&#13;
crowd who were in the Bank just felt that this wasn't the Bank's business. Some of the younger&#13;
people who were coming out of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and elsewhere&#13;
were saying [laughter], you know, "This is a very important issue." But it, it never--land reform&#13;
wasn't on the agenda.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Thomas Carroll said, when I talked to him about it, he said that for him the surprising&#13;
point was not that the Bank did not draw or push the governments into land reform, he thought&#13;
politically it just was not . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Turn this off; I want to tell you something.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But he said--but the other part of that question is that was the Bank more hesitant in&#13;
supporting those countries which initiated land reform on their own because the feeling is that&#13;
land reform generally failed. The post-reform cost--because structural changes occurred and&#13;
there are a lot of costs after the actual redistribution, and did the Bank say, â&#128;&#156;Well, you guys have&#13;
taken the political heat.â&#128;&#157; There are very few countries, but there were examples, and so, you&#13;
know . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Give me an example.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . now that you have. Well, Peru tried it in the later â&#128;&#152;60s.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, okay, the Peruvians.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Chile tried it . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . but of course [inaudible] . Nicaragua tried it, and the Philippines were on the verge&#13;
of trying it in the late '80s.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, the Bank was heavily criticized for some of the loans it made that&#13;
supported large-scale farmers that seemed to have imbedded the existing structure. One of the&#13;
countries I remember very well where there was a lot of criticism, a small one, Honduras,&#13;
because a large-scale cattle loan had been made. The critics of the Bank were very vociferous&#13;
about the fact that this was, you know, that Honduras might have had a reform movement, and&#13;
there was an incipient reform movement, and this kind of loan was simply maintaining existing&#13;
structures.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Which year was that?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: That would have been in about '74, somewhere around there. But the livestock-&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-you know, the guys who were handling livestock just said, â&#128;&#156;Listen, you know, you've got to&#13;
have large holdings for livestock.â&#128;&#157; That was the way they viewed it in those days, and they were&#13;
very upset about this.&#13;
&#13;
Now, Tanzania became one of the favorite countries of the Bank. I mean, they were going&#13;
through a fairly radical--I wouldn't call it a land-reform program but a change in the whole&#13;
structure of land holdings and land ownership and so forth. I don't think you can say that there&#13;
was--there was, I guess, perhaps I should correct myself--I think there were some people who&#13;
simply believed that redistribution of land was extremely radical and that this was not conducive&#13;
to the kind of investments that the--well, perhaps I shouldn't say that. It was very unsettling.&#13;
There was no telling what would the outcome be and the Bank shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t get involved. The Bank&#13;
wasn't pushing for that kind of change.&#13;
&#13;
Now, in very practical terms, the--your mention about Peru reminds me that there was an&#13;
approach. Somebody--there were some suggestions that perhaps the Bank could take the lead in&#13;
helping to develop, devise the means of underwriting bonds whereby the large landowners could&#13;
be compensated for giving up land for redistribution, but this idea wasnâ&#128;&#153;t, didn't fly, didn't go&#13;
anywhere.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Under the heading of rural development, at least putting aside land . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Excuse me, John. I want to say one last thing about this. I think--I think that&#13;
there was the beginnings of a recognition, which I think is widespread now, that, you know, that&#13;
land reform isn't a panacea. It was--in the early '60s the group we talked about believed it was a&#13;
panacea. Now I believe it's realized, having seen what's happened in one or two countries, that&#13;
it's not a panacea. Although some people would say without--those people said, and I share this&#13;
view--that without redistributing land you couldn't change the power structure in many countries.&#13;
And they saw it in that sense, and the Bank said, â&#128;&#156;Well, that's not our business,â&#128;&#157; at least in those&#13;
days, anyway.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, that sort of brings me to the question I wanted to put to you, which will take us&#13;
back, in a sense, almost to David Turnham's paper. Land reform, it can't be the answer because&#13;
there isn't enough land to go around as people keep multiplying, and so you have to think about&#13;
nonagricultural solutions to rural poverty . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . and to what extent did your operation get into questions like rural public works or&#13;
what's now the integrated rural development program in India, I mean, handing out little bits of&#13;
assets and things of that sort?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMEN: No.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No, it didn't?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: It did get into some in combination with the World Food Program and it did&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
work in labor-intensive work with other parts of the Bank, you know, labor-intensive road-&#13;
building and so forth, with Tony [Anthony A.] Churchill's crowd and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: There was some of that.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: And there was some effort to push more labor-intensive things, but they didnâ&#128;&#153;t--&#13;
there wasn't, there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t the emphasis on small-scale industry or things of that sort.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It brings me--I mentioned before Hollis. Was Redistribution with&#13;
Growth, Hollis, I mean Chenery-[Montek Singh] Ahluwalia, was that an important document&#13;
from where you sat, or was that just something the . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: No, it was important for the footprint.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Let me tell you something else, John. I don't know whether I should put this on&#13;
the record [laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We'll try to be discreet.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: All right. Uma Lele wrote this book about rural development.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: I had a staff of about 80 people at the time, a big staff, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know, something&#13;
like that. I asked them--this is the nerve center dealing with rural development, including other&#13;
peopleâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;How many of you people have read this book?â&#128;&#157; I think two had read it.&#13;
&#13;
In fact, there was a book written about the Bank by that Teresa Hayter and . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And Sheryl Pate [phonetic] ?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Sheryl Pierce [phonetic] ?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: No, no, no, not that.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No, I know the one that she did; in fact, Sally [Sally Watters Yudelman] told me that&#13;
you took her in, this young woman . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . and then she went back and blasted you.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, right. But she wrote about the people who worked. She thought it was&#13;
very amusing. As a matter of fact, this is the book over there. I could have cheerfully wrung her&#13;
neck because she took a lot of internal memos and so on. But she wrote that--well, the kind of&#13;
people she liked at the Bank in the agricultural department--she despised the young professionals&#13;
for reasons of her own; she had some clash with them--and the kind of people that she really&#13;
liked were the sort of the people whoâ&#128;&#153;d had tropical experience, surprisingly enough. She said&#13;
many with colonial backgrounds who had worked in developing sugar industries and so forth,&#13;
but the great weakness she found in them was that they hadn't kept up with the literature, very&#13;
few of them had read Marx, et cetera, et cetera. Well, that's true. [Laughter] They were not&#13;
people withâ&#128;&#148;a lot of the old guard were hands-on types, I mean they had a lot of experience,&#13;
they were very good, but they werenâ&#128;&#153;t terribly--the social issues werenâ&#128;&#153;t, didn't preoccupy them&#13;
at the time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You keep reminding me of things that--I want to jump for a moment to follow up on&#13;
what you just said, because in reflecting why the Bank neglected agriculture early on, I&#13;
hypothesize that one of several reasons might be a kind of two cultures reason, and that goes&#13;
back to my own sort of sense of things in India in the '60s, that the people who were working,&#13;
outlanders, who were working on agriculture by and large were sort of technical types, very&#13;
often agricultural scientists, but they are micro types in the field, those kind of people you found&#13;
in the foundations and AID [U.S. Agency for International Development] , and they weren't&#13;
macro money movers like you tend to have in the Bank. There was a sort of--I just had the sense&#13;
that up until sometime in the '60s there really weren't very many of these hands-on agricultural&#13;
types in the Bank. Is that right? Or . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, there were very few. The first time I visited the Bank there were 12&#13;
people in the agriculture department, and they wereâ&#128;&#148;it was headed by a man with a lot of&#13;
Indonesian experience, an engineer. But I think, John, thereâ&#128;&#153;s also, was an intellectual&#13;
underpinning for neglecting agriculture, and that was your name, your namesake . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, sure. There was a whole set of people. [all talking at once]&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: I mean, the [Arthur] Lewis theory is about dualism and agriculture and who&#13;
provides land and you modernize the market sector.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, sure, Albert Hirschman and all of the main liners, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, sure. So there was an intellectual--the big change that came was that&#13;
people said, â&#128;&#156;No, that's not the way to go,â&#128;&#157; that you can do something in agriculture. What made&#13;
it possible to do something in agriculture in many respects was the work of [Norman E.] Borlaug&#13;
and company. And remember one thing, too: McNamara was on the board of the Ford&#13;
Foundation, and he knew what was happening in agriculture. He knew about the green&#13;
revolution, and he knew the potential.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: And he was determined to do something about it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: But I think that's, you know, thatâ&#128;&#153;s the way it worked.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Now, let me ask you about these Christmas tree projects in Africa. How did that come&#13;
about? One question would be--you surely knew about the experience of community&#13;
development . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . which was very much a sort of similar concept but doing everything in the round,&#13;
wasn't it?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, yes and no. The so-called Christmas tree projects (short term of mine)&#13;
were those projects where there was an attempt to introduce elements that--there was a notion&#13;
that there you could have some synergy. You know that there was this notion that, you know, to&#13;
improve the standard of living you had to have--you could have something productive that would&#13;
increase incomes, but at the same time you needed to improve health and education and all the&#13;
rest of it . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, sure, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: . . and have health posts and so forth. And there was an attempt in the first&#13;
instance to take some areas and try and put in all these elements. They weren't exactly Christmas&#13;
trees; they were bare bones elements and--but what was lacking in the African context was, of&#13;
course, was the administrative capacity to do this, and also failure to appreciate the&#13;
dysfunctionalism--let's put it that way--of systems that, you know, that had--there were time lags,&#13;
and there were shortages of people. There was no local--a local currency counterpart wasn't&#13;
forthcoming, and the roads weren't built on time, and health posts were built but doctors weren't&#13;
sent out for two years, by which time a project was complete or the whole thing had broken&#13;
down and so forth. That was--all these projects were assumed to be financially sound and were&#13;
assumed to be--you know, that the productive component could carry the nonproductive&#13;
components. But a lot of them just--they just didn't work that well. They didn't work that way in&#13;
other parts of the world as well. It was just too ambitious . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: . . even though it was on a very modest scale. It wasn't--these weren't sort of&#13;
elaborate things.&#13;
&#13;
But I do remember, though, as director, seeing a project once, a cotton-producing project in&#13;
Tanzania or somewhere, and then seeing tucked into the project a hospital. I said, â&#128;&#156;What the hell&#13;
is this? [Laughter] Oh, my god!â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Well, that's integrated rural development!â&#128;&#157; because they were under the impression, the people&#13;
who were doing this were under the impression that you had to have, you know, multi-sectoral&#13;
components.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you have a--when I got to DAC in 1979, for a little while before we were&#13;
overtaken by the adjustment mania, we were in a sort of reflective mood, looking back and trying&#13;
to draw lessons from the experience with the more, the new style projects, rural, anti-poverty&#13;
projects, in Africa and elsewhere. A lot of bilaterals got into the same kind of thing. Do you&#13;
have any sense how the Bank did compared with the bilaterals on that stuff?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, there was a lot of co-financing.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, I would say I thought the Bank did pretty well.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: A lot of them didn't do well. There was a--there were lots of problems. One of&#13;
the problems, we found out, where these things did work modestly, was in a way you would have&#13;
a level of development in this limited region that was higher than anything around it. And this&#13;
created problems, you know, because you couldn't be--it's very hard to have an isolated&#13;
development without really cutting across sectors. In other words, the ministry of education is in&#13;
charge of education, and then here you have an area supported by the Bank where the school&#13;
system is superior to everything else. There were these kinds of problems.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: But Iâ&#128;&#153;ve visited area development projects where--in fact, I've been with&#13;
McNamara and by myself--with people from outside the area of development. In Nigeria, for&#13;
instance, which was supposed to have been a failure, people outside the area of development&#13;
came and pleaded to be included in the circumference of the area being developed because roads&#13;
were being put in, water points were being established, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What I was sort of thinking about, speculating about, was that the almost passion at&#13;
that time was to get benefits down to very--to the village level, to the poorest of the poor and the&#13;
right out at the end of, sort of, the periphery. And the Bank structurally is very much tilted, I&#13;
would say, toward wholesaling resources, that it's a headquarters-centered operation that's used&#13;
to moving money and so you need to take things up in fairly big bunches. And so there's a&#13;
problem of how do you sort of articulate from, from--and part of the answer might be, okay, take&#13;
up a big area and you try to sort of cordon it off from the rest of the mess and get the&#13;
administration right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, that was done, or else it was done through banks, you know, in India, all&#13;
the rural banks and so forth, and than stipulated that you have to have, you know--you have to&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
put limits on the size of borrowers, and of course this created tremendous problems, with banks&#13;
in Mexico and elsewhere nearly went bankrupt because of it. And, you know, make sure that if&#13;
you have seed distribution and fertilizer distribution, make sure that a certain proportion goes to&#13;
X, Y and Z. But you're right. The whole problem became the retailing because when you deal&#13;
with large numbers of small farmers, the overhead costs in dealing with them are much greater&#13;
than dealing with a few large farmers, especially if the large farmers are linked to the world's&#13;
capital markets or, you know, linked to the world's markets and use the money effectively and&#13;
produce for export and so forth. But you know the--a lot of schemes were devised. There were&#13;
the nucleus estates.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: You know, originally it just supported the estates, and then afterwards you&#13;
support, â&#128;&#156;Well, okay, weâ&#128;&#153;ll have a nucleus estate, but around the estate you've got to develop&#13;
smallholders,â&#128;&#157; and so forth. So that was an attempt to deal with this particular issue.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: One of the things which one sees in the real take-off or rural development strategy of&#13;
the Bank is sort of how rapidly it grew in a way in those few years. And one of the things--sort&#13;
of [inaudible] go back and say is that, was there, were there any sort of notes of caution or&#13;
whatever that â&#128;&#156;Letâ&#128;&#153;s try out the fieldâ&#128;&#157; or run a pilot, see the experiences for a few years and then,&#13;
sort of, replicate it. But it seems that there was exponential take-off. It's not a sort of steady,&#13;
gradual growth and then sort of reflection and then again growth.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, in many respects the whole rural development program was an&#13;
experiment. McNamara said so in his 1972 speech, you know, that this was an experiment, and&#13;
he said in that speech that it could fail. So while we, as you know the Bank is very--what shall&#13;
we say?--self-centered or whatever it is, you know, itâ&#128;&#153;s very--it sees itself as the center of the&#13;
universe, and compared with the size of the problem, I think there is this . .&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: . . nobody seemed to realize is that McNamara was very strongly driven by a&#13;
sense of need. He wanted to combine what he saw as the satisfying or meeting these tremendous&#13;
needs of the third world as he saw them--he wanted to combine meeting those needs with doing&#13;
it effectively, and that was the clash. He saw the--he saw the need and he pushed the Bank, he&#13;
pushed the staff to do more, but he wanted to do it effectively and that's where, in a way, there&#13;
was an incompatibility. And that's where the exponential growth came and things tended to fall&#13;
by the wayside. Very difficult to just have high economic rates of return, et cetera, et cetera,&#13;
while pushing to meet the needs. Also I think it was very regrettable that the term â&#128;&#156;poorest of&#13;
the poorâ&#128;&#157; was introduced. I think that was a great mistake, and it came to haunt us.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Why was that?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, because the poorest of the poor you couldn't reach doing the kind of&#13;
things the Bank could do. On the other hand, it was a very effective--you know, our critics hung&#13;
that around our necks, but it was very effective in terms of communication, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Let me ask you. You were one of his inner circle. He still insists, he gets adamant,&#13;
almost angry, over the issue of whether there is any necessary trade-off between equity and&#13;
growth and insists that there is none, goddamn it! You can get just as good results. Now . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Of quality and of quantity.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Quality and quantity, yes. Now, how widespread--there is certainly abundant&#13;
skepticism about that in the Bank and outside at present, but did you guys buy that at the time, or&#13;
was it as a sort of quirk of the boss that you had to sort of humor?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, I mean, when you looked at India and you looked at what happened in&#13;
India, this is the illustration. You know that you've got this tremendous growth and a large&#13;
number of small farmers participating. It was recognized it was in the irrigated areas, it was&#13;
recognized it was those farmers who were growing particular commodities, but it was cited as an&#13;
illustration. And then, of course, if you can do it in India, why can't you do it elsewhere,&#13;
although we tried to explain the special set of circumstances in India. And, of course, that was&#13;
the euphoria of the '60s that drove us into Africa, saying, â&#128;&#156;Well, look whatâ&#128;&#153;s happening in India.&#13;
Why shouldn't it happen in Africa?â&#128;&#157; Of course, there were very good reasons why it couldn't&#13;
happen in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
I had my doubts about the time horizons. You know, five years basically is a very short period.&#13;
I mean, you know, you had to, you had to, you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t--a lot of things couldn't happen in such a&#13;
brief period of time, especially starting from a very low base. I think we may have gone too fast,&#13;
but as I say, it was all an experiment, the rural development thing, the poverty approach was all&#13;
an experiment--a very large one--and it worked in some places, didn't work elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
Now that's a pretty devastating thing to say if you're an official of the Bank because of, for the&#13;
following reasons, and I've often thought about this. And we got in Nigeria and Tanzania and&#13;
say, â&#128;&#156;Listen, this is the way to go. We want to help the small farmers. It's a damned doable&#13;
plan.â&#128;&#157; And then the damned thing fails; I retire from the Bank; the Tanzanians have got a huge&#13;
debt on their hands. In that respect there's no accountability.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: And that, of course, to me is one of the great problems within this institution.&#13;
You see, I don't know if you know this, Johnâ&#128;&#148;now, Iâ&#128;&#153;m not telling tales out of school--but all&#13;
the Bank's loans are guaranteed by the governments, so it doesn't matter whether a project works&#13;
or not, it's going to be repaid. Whereas, if there was a system whereby projects workedâ&#128;&#148;when&#13;
projects failed, they showed up on a balance sheet somewhere. There was some accountability,&#13;
and then people were held accountable: â&#128;&#156;Well, why did you promote this if it failed?â&#128;&#157; That, I&#13;
think, is to me, is one of the difficulties of an institution like the Bank. It's probably like that in&#13;
many of these [inaudible] activities.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                  September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Would that reduce risk taking by the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yes, it would. It certainly would.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So in that case couldn't you have [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: You've have the stresses and strains, yes. You'd have, you know, the pressure to&#13;
do something and then there is that penalty for failure.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I can think of a sort of theoretical answer, but I guess it's not very realistic. I used to&#13;
say when I was in India with AID that--after I became aware of what the technical assistance&#13;
process was like--that actually I thought a good baseball batting average was about the best you&#13;
could do in technical assistance, about one out of three would work.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And that was not such a disturbing--it's a sort of cynical type of thing, but--but it&#13;
doesn't have any afterlife as a proposition as long as you're giving grants.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And so if IDA [International Development Association] were turned into a grant-&#13;
making establishment then there wouldn't be this overhang of responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But the other unfortunateâ&#128;&#148;the other unfortunate thing in the year â&#128;&#153;70 theyâ&#128;&#153;re looking&#13;
at a center for agriculture returning to Africa. Africa, at that time, still a lot of the money was&#13;
from IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: IBRD, right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, right. [all talking at once]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But in the â&#128;&#152;80s that--so unfortunately IBRD money was [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, let me give you an illustration of the circumstances, though, that may&#13;
change one's views. The Bank made a loan for an irrigation project in Madagascar very early on.&#13;
I can't remember the dates exactly. When they did the audit of that loan, it was considered to be&#13;
one of the best irrigation projects that had been funded. Then ten years later they did an impact&#13;
study, one of these impact studies, and they considered it to be the worst project the Bank had&#13;
ever funded. So I went to Madagascar to find out why was it that in this period there was such a&#13;
change. And the answer was very simple: when the loan was made, Madagascar still had a large&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
number of French technicians and was still very much in the French fold. The use of water was&#13;
strictly controlled. The system was well maintained. There was a lot of discipline that ran from&#13;
the top down, but it was effective in terms of increasing production [inaudible] rice production,&#13;
well managed in that sense. People had very little to say about it. Then there was a revolution,&#13;
and the French were forced to leave, they were kicked out. People's committees were established&#13;
to run the system. When I went there the sluice gates were missing, the sluice gates were!&#13;
[Laughter] I went to talk to some of the farmers and asked them through an interpreter if the&#13;
government, if they ever saw extension agents and if saw the seed and fertilizer on time, and they&#13;
assured me they did. But I had another man with me who understood the language. He said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Listen, what the government interpreter tells you is not what these people are saying. They said&#13;
they haven't seen anybody for years, you know, and in fact, as far as they are concerned, the&#13;
further away the government people keep from them, the better.â&#128;&#157; But the whole system had&#13;
broken down because the environment had changed. Now, you know, so then I say, â&#128;&#156;You've got&#13;
to hold people accountable.â&#128;&#157; Who do you hold accountable for that? And I think that's happened&#13;
in several cases, but that's the kind of unpredictability that makes it all so difficult. That's apart&#13;
from other things.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In the sort of inner circle that John was referring to, that you were a part of . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: I wasn't part of the inner circle, but I was very close to the president. In fact,&#13;
Maurice Strong used to tell me that McNamara spoke to me far more often than he spoke to the&#13;
vice presidents. This was a very mixed blessing, I might add [laughter], because--this is in my,&#13;
you know, oral history--because he was very quantitatively-oriented and he, you know, wanted&#13;
numbers, to churn out these numbers: â&#128;&#156;This is government subsidy; this is . . .â&#128;&#157; As I've said in&#13;
that oral history, you see, a lot of my colleagues were very unhappy with me because he wanted&#13;
to know how many beneficiaries there were from these projects, and I used to go to them and&#13;
say, â&#128;&#156;How many beneficiaries are there from projects A, B, C, D, E?â&#128;&#157; And theyâ&#128;&#153;d give me the&#13;
numbers, and then I'd add them up and give them to him. And they'd be very upset with me, and&#13;
then I'd say, â&#128;&#156;But these are your numbers.â&#128;&#157; You know, because--this was very much a problem.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah. I got--you remind me of a couple of things. I just want to take soundings with&#13;
you. And one of them, after all, came up in the '70s, is in agriculture--it was a big deal in the&#13;
Bank: T and V [training and visit system].&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Oh yeah, oh yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Was that under your . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I had a lot to do with [Daniel] Benor.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did you? Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: I went to India with him the first time, at the beginning. His real mentor at the&#13;
Bank was Ernie [Ernest] Stern.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Really?&#13;
&#13;
                                     Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                  September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, at least Ernie says he was. [Laughter] I suppose success has many&#13;
fathers and--you know the rest of the story! You know how Benor came to the Bank, don't you?&#13;
You know how it all started in Turkey?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He started in Turkey, yes.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: In Turkey, that project that seemed to be so successful. And [Munir P.]&#13;
Benjenk had something to do with that, too. And then he went to India. I think that's when Ernie&#13;
took him to India.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, Ernie was then in the vice presidency of the region.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, right, of the region, yeah. And of course he did have an influence and he&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t--he managed to change the system, the rural development system, from, you know, the&#13;
village level worker, the all-purpose village level worker, including agriculture, then becoming a&#13;
special worker dealing with agriculture. This was the key change bureaucratically.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: And then he--I think it started, as Benor tells it, because he went to a lot of&#13;
villages and asked them, asked the village level workers how much time they spent on&#13;
agriculture, the multiple-service worker. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve forgetten now what it's called.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: VLW [village level worker].&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, VLW. And he found that that man was spending about a very small part&#13;
of his time in agriculture, and he convinced Mrs. [Indira] Gandhi that so long as there wasn't&#13;
anybody who was spending full time on agriculture, it would be very difficult to have&#13;
agricultural change of the kind he had in mind. So they had a tremendous inner bureaucratic&#13;
struggle--and I donâ&#128;&#153;t know if you were a part of all this--in which they simply took the village&#13;
level worker away from the community development and put it in agriculture. Of course, the&#13;
hassle out of that was enormous because of turf issues and all the rest of it. And then he&#13;
developed--his assistants mainly developed--a very systematic approach to spreading the&#13;
message, and in the circumstances in India this was extremely effective. There was a message to&#13;
be spread, there was a [inaudible] to the group, you know, and so on and so on, and I think he&#13;
contributed a great deal. And then the idea's been taken elsewhere, and basically all the T and V&#13;
method is a systematic approach to spreading [inaudible] Now, I mean, that's in a very simple&#13;
sense.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I knew quite a bit about it at the time. I may have had too much of a sour grapes sort&#13;
of attitude, I mean, the idea of having the VLW concentrate on agriculture is not new with&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Benor, that had been part of the doctrine back in the '60s, and it had been done in the intensive&#13;
areas, I think, but not throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Right, right, right, right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And a lot of this stuff had been experimented with very extensively--Akhter Hameed&#13;
Khan at Comilla [Bangladesh] . And when it came out, I remember (Jim [James Q.] Harrison&#13;
helped him write this book) I thought it was an awful lot of heavy advertising kind of by the&#13;
Bank of some common sense, and I spoke lightly of it at a seminar in honor of, in memory of&#13;
Wolf Ladejinsky, which I think was in '78 in Kyoto.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: You know, we were there.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You were there?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yes. I was chairing the damned thing.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did you chair it?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yes, because [Peter] Cargill was my senior vice president at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay. And Crawford was there, also chairing. Yes, yes. Well, do you remember, I&#13;
gave some kind of paper, and I spoke with kind of a light touch about T and V, and Bob [Robert]&#13;
Picciotto almost took my head off!&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, right, right. Well, Bob was working on India. Well, but he was--Benor&#13;
was bitterly opposed by the old colonial types, especially those who worked in Africa, saying,&#13;
you know, â&#128;&#156;Well, we had advisory services. There's nothing new about this.â&#128;&#157; And that's right,&#13;
you know, like so many things, there was nothing new about it. You know, everybody, you,&#13;
anybody coming into a room would agree, â&#128;&#156;Listen, if we have a systematic approach to this&#13;
problem, we'll do much better.â&#128;&#157; You know, we can always do better. But the Bank did come on&#13;
very heavily, and Benor was used for PR [public relations] purposes.&#13;
&#13;
I remember going to a DAC meeting once, traveling with the assistant secretary of the Treasury&#13;
and flying across with him to Paris--can't remember his name now--and there had been a big&#13;
article by Bart [Hobart] Rowan. Benor had taken Bart Rowan to Thailand to a seminar or&#13;
something and did a snow job on Bart! [Laughter] But also showed him some good results.&#13;
Jesus! There was a full-page article in the [Washington]Post about it, and this guy said to me,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Listen, about three articles like that are worth a billion dollars to IDA!â&#128;&#157; [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
And let me tell you another thing. When [A.W.] Clausen went to have a lunch on Wall Street&#13;
once, the thing he talked about about the Bank was Benor, you know, what's different about it.&#13;
&#13;
No, no, the guy has had a tremendous impact, and I've just seen--I've just been in Africa, I've just&#13;
reviewed a project, the Global 2000 project in Ghana and so forth, and I've seen his influence,&#13;
and I think it's positive. Well, it's been oversold, and there's a lot of criticism, and it ought to be&#13;
&#13;
                                     Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                  September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
modified and all the rest of it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: To be fair, I have to follow up and say that right after that I was in India again and I&#13;
went down to West Bengal to--because that was one of the states that adopted it. I thought this&#13;
bureaucracy under the communist leadership would be cynical about this if any, and they were&#13;
absolutely bananas, they were so much in favor of it.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, I went there with Crawford and Benor. And I always remember when&#13;
John said to a fairly senior official down there, â&#128;&#156;Well, tell us about the Benor method.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
He said, â&#128;&#156;We don't call it the Benor method here. We call it our method.â&#128;&#157; [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
Which, as I said, was a success.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: No, no, I think Benor--listen, that guy--the other thing about Benor, apart from&#13;
his charisma, is heâ&#128;&#153;s the hardest-working guy I've ever met. When he says, â&#128;&#156;Let's start early,â&#128;&#157;&#13;
there's a knock on your door at 3 o'clock in the morning! [Laughter] Secondly, he's a good&#13;
agriculturalist, and that's terribly important because the way he got, really got going was to show&#13;
how farmers could increase productivity without increasing inputs, by doing things differently,&#13;
different spacing of plants, different densities of plants. These are costless improvements, and&#13;
they made a difference. So his first--you know, the first impact was of that kind. The second&#13;
thing about Benor was--and this irritated some of the people in the Bank--was he had very good&#13;
rapport with the heads, the leaders, you know, Mrs. Gandhi and others. He was a guy who could&#13;
deal with them. So this was not--this doesn't help much in terms of personal relations. No, I&#13;
think Benor is an illustration of one man who made a big difference.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What was your sense of another issue which is, the Bank has sort of emphasized: it&#13;
seems relatively more in the '80s, the whole thing on ag policy in terms of pricing, inputs and&#13;
outputs. The old thing is to now say that, especially in Africa, cocoa or coffee were squeezed&#13;
out, more [inaudible] very poor pricing policies. As you look back on the '70s, was the&#13;
emphasis much more on projects?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, right. I was also on the first World Bank mission to Uganda, economic&#13;
development in Uganda, with Ed Mason. I was his assistant at Harvard then; he took me along.&#13;
The marketing boards were a big issue in Uganda.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: But the interesting thing was we didn't focus so much on the role of the state.&#13;
We just focused on how they could become more efficient and how they could reduce the&#13;
marketing margins. The price--and it was just at the time when the coffee agreement was being&#13;
signed.&#13;
&#13;
                                      Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                   September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s late â&#128;&#152;60s?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, so there was noâ&#128;&#148;but the price issues weren't--greatly elevated wasnâ&#128;&#153;t the&#13;
[inaudible] , simply was how to make it more efficient. My own view, of course, is that net&#13;
prices are important, elasticity and supplies are important and so forth. But I feel after all these&#13;
years--and I've been in the game for even longer than John, 40 years or so--I'm still finding it&#13;
very difficult for somebody, [Hans P.] Binswanger or somebody, to come up and show me&#13;
exactly what effect did this have. You know that the--if you look at the literature on supply&#13;
responses, it's absolutely dismaying. You know, we've talked about it so much, it's one of those&#13;
things that we take as given, but if you look for it, it's very dismaying to find that itâ&#128;&#153;s very hard&#13;
to prove. Having said all that, it's quite obvious that it's quite clear people aren't going to&#13;
produce more if the returns to labor aren't conducive or too low, sort of. But I always argue that&#13;
if you build a road or build a dam or educate, train people, especially train people, and develop&#13;
research, for example, this does have a lasting impact.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There was this--I guess you might have heard the story; it happened after you left, in&#13;
'83 or '84--there was yellow cover, itâ&#128;&#153;s not yellow cover, staff working paper; it used to be the&#13;
yellow . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Is this the paper by [Kevin M.] Cleaver?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yeah, right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, Stern got very upset with that.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And Stern and Anne Krueger. Have you heard that story?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Rather unfair, it was.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But that was the incident which led to the yellow staff working papers being&#13;
discontinued. Kevin Cleaver was, I guess, in . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: He was in Nairobi. He was an agricultural economist in Nairobi, bright&#13;
agricultural economist. And he did an analysis of the factors that contribute to agricultural&#13;
growth, and he downplayed the role of prices and up--boosted the role of technology, you know.&#13;
And since the Bank was then on the [inaudible] their public policy, was working on the whole&#13;
policy area for the [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That was one of the lines John [James W.] Mellor pursued, though.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
Then Stern got very upset, saying that, you know, â&#128;&#156;Listen, the Bank's raison d'Ãªtre or whatever&#13;
&#13;
                                     Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                  September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
you want to call it, its whole focus and thrust is on prices and price policy, and here you come&#13;
and say it's not all that important. Jesus! Whose side are you on?â&#128;&#157; [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
Black mark! Smart guy. You should interview him.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yeah. We had heard it was Anne Krueger . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, she might well have been disturbed at that.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . who came down and she got very upset about this whole thing, and she sort of&#13;
marched up to Ernie Stern and . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And Ernie was implementing this vice presidential--that sounds to me a little bit&#13;
moreâ&#128;&#148;fits the roles a little better, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
Another shot in the dark, but you had to have an impression as you came aboard, I guess, of all&#13;
this tremendous water analysis work that had been going on. Do you have a view of the [Pieter]&#13;
Lieftinck report? I don't ask if you've ever read it--it's 30 volumes.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Iâ&#128;&#153;ve seen it. The one on the water distribution and India and Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It is. It's basically the Pakistan water management issue, and there's a tremendous&#13;
hassle over modes of drainage, between the SCARP [Salinity Control and Reclamation&#13;
Projects] , which had been a kind of an AID thing or U.S., and smaller tube wells. And I just&#13;
wonder whether--I haven't read it. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve read Vern Rutan on it. Vern was in a group I was with&#13;
that looked at the Bank's history in Pakistan over a period of 25 years in â&#128;&#153;85-â&#128;&#153;86, I guess it was,&#13;
â&#128;&#153;84-â&#128;&#152;85. And Lieftinck's report is often spoken of with almost hushed tones, that it's a&#13;
tremendous professional achievement. He was a very important man. It also blessed Tarbela,&#13;
having however noted that groundwater irrigation would be eight times cheaper than this huge&#13;
dam. And it seemed to me that it still left an awful lot of puzzles about where drainage should&#13;
go in Pakistan, and that seem to still be there. So I just wonder whether you have any notion&#13;
about . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, I think that the true revolution in India and Pakistan has come through&#13;
tube wells. I think that a lot of people have missed that. There are something like five million&#13;
tube wells in India and China, but, you know, this wasâ&#128;&#148;this was what made the tremendous&#13;
change. And the whole problem of managing and administering this and doing it in a way that&#13;
isn't environmentally detrimental is an important issue there.&#13;
&#13;
I wasn't party to the, you know, the whole water issue, but I have written about it since then. I've&#13;
written about irrigation. I wrote a piece for [both talking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, for the [H. Jeffrey] Leonard volume.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah. And I think we rushed into irrigation. But what the Bank did in support&#13;
of the green revolution was, basically was through irrigation. You see, the lending for irrigation&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
went up enormously.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Of course you've got programs through this diplomatic foray by [Eugene R.] Black&#13;
and . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, well, that was before my time. I understood what happened full well . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: . . and, you know, this was important contribution to sort of save the new&#13;
nations.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, absolutely, but, but it may have twisted, distorted the work of the Bank for a . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: I think so. I think so.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . long time to follow.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: And of course the whole drainage question is still an issue that rankles.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Is it that the project methodology--some people weâ&#128;&#153;ve been talking to on the&#13;
methodology itself say that the drainage subcomponents of irrigation projects, there would be&#13;
almost a natural bias arising, I mean, say [inaudible] tropics something . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . because of the way one canâ&#128;&#153;t be [all talking at once] benefits down the road.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Absolutely. Because the probabilities for needing drainage are sometimes an&#13;
open question, so you don't want to hedge, put in an expensive hedge if it means that the&#13;
economic rate of return of your project going to get [inaudible] That's what it boils down to.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, right, and you canâ&#128;&#153;t come a cropper beyond the time horizon.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: That's right; that's exactly right. But the irrigation advisors, at least my&#13;
irrigation advisor, used to say--well, his view was, you know, that this problem can be dealt with&#13;
in due course.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yeah, the other thing other than irrigation and drainage that the Bank, I guess the&#13;
second and largest, has also been--not really controversial but, you know, it's sort of, is&#13;
agriculture credit.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                  September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: This whole thing of . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Plenty of controversy! [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And a lot of it: who gets the money. And especially now--in fact, a few months back&#13;
the Board was very split, although it came on a paper on financial sector operations, but now itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
sort of going down.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Whoâ&#128;&#153;s the guy who went back toâ&#128;&#148;[Avishay] Braverman, went back to . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Braverman.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . Israel. He had a paper that almost damned the whole of agriculture credit, didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
he?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yeah. [J. Luis] Guasch and Braverman.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: And [John] von Pischke and so on, but their criticism was largely that a credit--&#13;
not because of the supply side but simply because the credit systems the Bank supported didn't&#13;
mobilize local resources.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: This was not [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see, I see.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: I thought it was just--but that's a different matter. The other issue was who was&#13;
getting the credit and did credit make a difference. Couldn't the local--couldnâ&#128;&#153;t the informal&#13;
sector provide the credits [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And the other thing was to do with the interest rate . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Interest rates, sure.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . which is very . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, when I was at the Bank we didâ&#128;&#148;we made huge loans to India for rural&#13;
credit in support of the green revolution. And I think what--there were problems. And one of&#13;
the problems was the slow--well, there were the problems of corruption and so forth--but I think&#13;
that, we started in Bombay with the nerve center of the system. Bob Picciotto did this,&#13;
[inaudible] whatever the name, and worked with the Indian authorities to develop modalities for&#13;
assessing loans and so forth. But I think the problems that emerged eventually were the&#13;
repayment rates, and these became political issues. But also repayment rates became issues&#13;
during drought periods. They were not repaying and then having huge arrears, and when does an&#13;
arrear become a bad debt, and do you forgive them and so forth. So it was very hard to have the&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
kind of discipline in the system that some people wanted to make it effective, and it became&#13;
subsidies for small farmers.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, that's--boy, there's no way to credit . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: In Mexico, too.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . the credit system can be totally demolished by this kind of mindless forgiveness.&#13;
I've seen it in Senegal and then this regime recently in India. That's one thing--it's so mindless&#13;
that I should think that a donor should be able somehow to write in a term.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, they did. There were clauses in the agreements. These were honored in&#13;
the breech more than . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's an interesting thing, and it's, I guess, given the whole complex of transactions&#13;
with a country, it's not enough to trigger severe response on the part of the donor, is it?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, that leads you to technical questions like when does an arrear become a&#13;
failure? How long do you carry it on your books? You've got this in the savings and loan&#13;
problem. So that those were issues. The Banco Real in Mexico is another one. It was set up to&#13;
help the small farmers. The Bank poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the Banco Real,&#13;
and arrears just piled up. Money was distributed. There was a lot of suspicion about who got it,&#13;
what the overheads were and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Sounds like a bad line of business for the Bank, doesn't it, really?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, it was an important line.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: I don't know if it is a bad line. You'd have to look at the evaluations, but it was&#13;
seen in the context--you see, there was a model, there was a, rather a vision of what was required&#13;
for agricultural development by the early 1970s or late 1960s, and that was technology and then&#13;
the means of getting the technology to the farmers and then the ability of the farmers to acquire&#13;
the technology and the marketing side. You know there was a sort of . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, sure.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: . . you knew, you knew what was required, and in there was the credit&#13;
component . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, sure.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: . . because the assumption was that farmers didn't have the means of acquiring&#13;
it, and you had to make sure that they could acquire it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Also, there was the issue of how you--I mean, it was a good--if you wanted to put local&#13;
cost financing into a country this was a good place to do it.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Right, right. And then a lot of the banks were upset with the World Bank&#13;
because, when it insisted that they lend to small farmers, the overheads of lending to small&#13;
farmers became quite high for them. So they tried to subsidize that through the interest rates.&#13;
Some did. Others didn't. Instead of--but there was never--what I would like to have seen was to&#13;
say, â&#128;&#156;Look, if you're going to lend to small farmers and the overheads are going to be high,&#13;
initially why don't we start with an experimental program where you subsidize the management&#13;
of the program, not work through the farmers. Say that the costs of running this program are&#13;
high; therefore, weâ&#128;&#153;re going to make a special provision for the costs of running the program&#13;
because you are going to have to need more field people, you've got more, you know, surveys,&#13;
more interviews, more forms to be filled in,â&#128;&#157; all the kinds of things that people complained&#13;
about, the transaction costs are high.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I've learned a lot. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: I'm going to write a book when I finish my current assignment, and it's going to&#13;
be called â&#128;&#156;The Reflections of the Lord of Poverty.â&#128;&#157; [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, great!&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: You know, I've been in this game a long time and I've been thinking--when I&#13;
was walking down here I was thinking, â&#128;&#156;Jesus, you know, is there anything we have learned?&#13;
What about some of these experiences?â&#128;&#157; I've just done this review of this program in Ghana, the&#13;
Sasakawa Global 2000.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, really? Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: You know, Norman Borlaug with the--Sasakawa through the [Jimmy] Carter&#13;
Center gave them 5 million dollars and said do something about small farmers in Ghana.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yes, the Carter group was kind of euphoric about it.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, well, they shouldn't have been.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: I did the review of it. It isnâ&#128;&#153;t working. The thing ran away from them.&#13;
&#13;
See, it's one of the problems the Bank faces, the kind of problem, the scaling up problem. It&#13;
started with a small number of farmers, and when Norman Borlaug went in there, he took the&#13;
Indian model and said but, you know--he said there was a technology available in Ghana,&#13;
especially in corn, because CIMMYT [International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center] had&#13;
been working there for about ten years, I think, helped develop the Ghanaian researchers, and&#13;
they developed suitable corn varieties and so forth which flourished with fertilizer. Borlaug saw&#13;
&#13;
                                   Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
this and said, â&#128;&#156;Well, we've got the technology. The problem is getting it out.â&#128;&#157; And so he&#13;
brought in four or five expatriates whoâ&#128;&#153;d worked with him in various parts of rural Latin&#13;
America mainly. And they started--they looked around and they found a district where they&#13;
found 40 farmers who were prepared to try the new varieties and use fertilizers on them. And&#13;
they arranged for them to get the fertilizer, get the seed, and the results were phenomenal. These&#13;
people got yields five times higher than anything they had ever received. So then 1,500 farmers&#13;
signed up, and they arranged for them to get the fertilizer and the seed, and this was successful.&#13;
In year three something like 8,000 farmers signed up; in year four 15,000; in year five 85,000.&#13;
And the minister of agriculture was absolutely in the clouds about this, saying, â&#128;&#156;Well, we're&#13;
going to solve our food problem. I want to have 200,000 farmers benefiting from this.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
But several things happened in the meantime. One wasâ&#128;&#148;you know, the tightly-controlled&#13;
program where they measured yields very carefully and the quantities of fertilizer used started to&#13;
slip away because the numbers got too large. Secondly, contrary to anything in the T and V, the&#13;
retailing function--when they looked at the country, they said, â&#128;&#156;Well, look, you've got an&#13;
extension service of 3,000 people who are grossly underemployed. We'll use them. They'll&#13;
distribute the fertilizer, and they'll arrange for these people to get credit and all the rest of it, and&#13;
theyâ&#128;&#153;ll see, you know, they'll nominate the farmers who should receive them.â&#128;&#157; So the extension&#13;
service became heavily involved in the distribution of fertilizer and seed, and the number of&#13;
extension service became overwhelmed fairly quickly. In addition to which, if you had access to&#13;
credit and you could get the seed and fertilizer in a tight situation, this gave you wealth.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: So the problems of abuse of power in the extension service soon became&#13;
apparent.&#13;
&#13;
But the most important thing that happened was the following--and this isâ&#128;&#148;this should be talked&#13;
about right at the beginning about agricultural scientists and others. The Bank had introduced a&#13;
structural adjustment program, and in the four, five years of the program that was underway&#13;
there was a tremendous devaluation, and all subsidies were removed, and marketing was&#13;
privatized. So the main input was fertilizer. The cost of fertilizer went up about five times, but&#13;
the prices received for corn and sorghum never moved at all or even declined a little bit. And so&#13;
the whole economics of the package turned around. So in the year in which 85,000 farmers were&#13;
given fertilizer and seed, two criteria were used to test the program: one was the impact on&#13;
yields, which was very good up until then but they couldn't cope with measuring the yields of&#13;
85,000 farmers, and the second was repayment rates for the loans, and whereas in the first three&#13;
years the repayment rates were near 100 percent, the fourth and fifth year they dropped down to&#13;
about 30 percent because it was no longer profitable. And that's in a nutshell one of the&#13;
problems, one of the things that happened.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That shows the problems of enclaved approaches, doesnâ&#128;&#153;t it?&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, right, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But also, I mean Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been looking at Ghana, and it's a very interesting business with&#13;
&#13;
                                      Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                   September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Bank trying to make one country successful, but the whole thing is so much, you know, on&#13;
the macro.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, right, and then when I was in Ghana, of course, what my impression was--&#13;
and this is just an impression--was the Bank had worked very hard to get the supply conditions&#13;
right, the conditions right to attract investment, but I don't think investment was forthcoming.&#13;
And this is another thing Mr. John Lewis is famous for saying, â&#128;&#156;You know, you guys are so sure&#13;
you've got the answers!â&#128;&#157; [Laughter] You see, because you know, on paper, you know, the&#13;
devaluation, the taxes had been changed, and this had been changed, that had been changed, but&#13;
foreigners, outside of one or two investments in gold and things like that, external investment is&#13;
very limited and the Ghanaians seem very itchy, very nervous.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: But that's, thatâ&#128;&#153;s--in a very modest way, that's the scaling-up problem, and that's&#13;
the problem of NGOs [non-governmental organizations] .&#13;
&#13;
And just turn this over. I want to tell you a story about this.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
You're still spreading the message of the Indian model, you know, the fertilizer/seed--the&#13;
biological/chemical revolution, which is fine, but look how the circumstances have changed.&#13;
When this started we were encouraging governments to subsidize fertilizer. We used to promote&#13;
technological change. I said, â&#128;&#156;You know, now the costs have changed so muchâ&#128;&#157;--and this is&#13;
coming back to your point about do you pay attention to costs and prices. Obviously you have&#13;
to.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But the Bank has gotten into a sort of knee-jerk posture with respect to subsidies. It's&#13;
against any and all subsidies of all kinds.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, well, I think that's a mistake.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yeah, I think so.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There's a very sharp rift. In fact, the exchanges between the U.S. and Japanese EDs&#13;
[Executive Directors] a few months back were amazing on this, although this was on subsidies to&#13;
industrial, but the principle of, you know, the industrial is not very different from sort of&#13;
philosophical underpinnings in agriculture. And completely different.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Would you like to know what I think was the most successful, some of the most&#13;
successful projects in agriculture?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Please! Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                  September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: I think in terms of the Bank's original criteria the most successful project was&#13;
Malaysia, the Jengka Triangle, where they were growing high unit value products, rubber and oil&#13;
palm and, you know, where there was infrastructure, where the Bank came with infrastructure,&#13;
there was good market [inaudible] , and good technology provided by the plantations. I think&#13;
that's one of the most successful. This is the kind of thing that lends itself to this pattern of&#13;
development, you know, where capital is really the missing issue, where the Bank was simply&#13;
providing the capital. Those are the kinds of projects, where everything's in place except the&#13;
capital, and that's what makes it a good--the most difficult projects are where you are trying to&#13;
change, you know, the whole structure. This is what happened in Tanzania and elsewhere. But&#13;
where things were in place, the money made a difference.&#13;
&#13;
But then, you see, you're playing the role of a merchant bank, in a sense. You're just providing&#13;
capital, but the real problems are where you've got to provide the whole package, you've got to&#13;
change systems, you've got governments to change, you've got to change local institutions.&#13;
That's where the greatest difficulties are, and that's what happened in the [inaudible] in Africa, in&#13;
the difficult areas.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: But I also think the Bank did play a big role in India in their increase in food&#13;
production, and I'll tell you why. I think it's correct to say that when the president went to India&#13;
after the Bell mission, the thing that he did--in fact, somebody told me this; it may have been the&#13;
Indian minister himself--the big contribution that he made was he said, â&#128;&#156;We'll stand behind you,&#13;
make sure that you have the resources you need, especially the foreign exchange, to push the big&#13;
. . .â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think that story is quotedâ&#128;&#148;I want to talk to somebody a little bit to make sure I'm--at&#13;
least test my own interpretation. I've been writing about this--on my own, not for this project--&#13;
and going back and doing a lot of, looking at a lot of the documentation. Also, I did a lot of&#13;
interviewing in India over the last four or five years. My impression is that the Bank over claims&#13;
in, for example, in Bernie Bell's oral history and particularly in the IDA retrospective, and what&#13;
you're quoting is a quotation from [C. S.] Subramaniam.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Now, he made that, I think, in a lecture that--Jack Crawford got him to Australia in&#13;
1979, and he gave a whole set of lectures in which he is deeply incensed at the Americans and&#13;
very, very understandably so. He got, as all Indians did, totally infuriated by the treatment that&#13;
LBJ [Lyndon B. Johnson] gave them in terms of short-tethering. And that was between '66 and&#13;
'68, basically. But that this remark about George Woods saying that he would give them the&#13;
money--of course he couldn't say. It was the consortium he was talking about, and he did&#13;
promise them money in, when Asoka Mehta came and did his deal with Woods in the spring of&#13;
1966.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: It was Woods, not . . .&#13;
&#13;
                                    Montague Yudelman&#13;
                                 September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It was Woods, not McNamara, and they did this deal which led to the devaluation and&#13;
the whole liberalization effort on the part of the Indians. The deal was that there would be 900&#13;
million dollars of program money from the consortium, and the understanding--ours in Delhi--&#13;
was that it was going to be for a series of years, at least three. It took a hell of a job to get it&#13;
together one year, mostly because in the sense of Johnson and the Congress resisting, but then&#13;
LBJ really welshed on the deal. And it never came through the second year or the third year, so&#13;
that the assurance that they were going to have the money was not made good, and that was not&#13;
about agriculture, anyhow: it was about liberalization. And it absolutely queered relations&#13;
between the U.S. and India, and it made the Indians, I.G. Patel and company, very, very&#13;
defensive in terms of macro fiscal policy. But meanwhile the green revolution was charging&#13;
ahead, and the Bank then did play the role that you speak of precisely in the '70s, but it's because&#13;
the U.S.--it wasn't that that broke the relations between the U.S. and India; it was what happened&#13;
on the eastern side, the Bangladesh business. That fractured the relationship, and then IDA&#13;
became the residual donor as against the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And so then you, when you came, you were pushing big money into ag credit and&#13;
whatnot that did really move the green revolution in that crucial period.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: So I would say that in terms of overall perspective, in my period, the great&#13;
successes were in Asia.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, I think that . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: But they were in train, and the Bank supported these and where, you know, rode&#13;
with them.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: How about Indonesia and Bangladesh, the other two large . . .&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, there were great and bloody fights over Indonesia in the Bank, by the&#13;
way, over transmigration.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: You know about that?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yeah, well, we had this interesting thing with Bernie Bell.&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Yeah, but there . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What was yours?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                  September 12, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
YUDELMAN: Well, one of the big fights was--well, let's start with transmigration. It was aâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
took a long time for a clear understanding of what transmigration was. Some people saw it as a&#13;
partial answer anyway to the population issue vis-Ã -vis jobs and so forth. Eventually it came to&#13;
be seen as a settlement-type project on its own merits, settlement-type projects, but it was&#13;
expensive. And the outer islands, the resources, soil resources, the natural resources, weren't as&#13;
great as people thought they were. People didn't know much about them.&#13;
&#13;
After the first project, when you looked at the numbers involved, it suddenly became apparent&#13;
that it was very expensive and very costly to resettle a family the way we were doing it. And&#13;
some of the early settlements were very good, but they were like urban development in the rural&#13;
areas, you know, a house and a garden and roads and everything, and it was being done by&#13;
consultants. Also, I'm sure there was quite a rake off involved, although we couldn't track it&#13;
down, but it was costly for families.&#13;
&#13;
The president was quite upset about this and said that he, you know, that he wanted a hold the&#13;
costs down below a certain number. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve forgotten the exact number.&#13;
