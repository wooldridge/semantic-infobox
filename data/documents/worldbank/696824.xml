STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
1.1          The Republic of Georgia is a relatively small country with a population of 5.4 million&#13;
and a geographical area of 70,000 square kilometers. The capital, Tbilisi, has a population of 1.5&#13;
million. Georgia occupies the western portion of the isthmus between the Caspian and Black Seas. The&#13;
eastern portion is the Republic of Azerbaijan while the land-locked Republic of Armenia takes up a part&#13;
of the southern portion. The three republics together constitute a buffer region between Russia to the&#13;
north and Iran and Turkey to the south. Two major mountain ranges (the Main and Lesser Caucasus&#13;
Chains) run through this region in an east-west direction and constitute major barriers to north-south&#13;
movements. Georgia controls most of the valley between the two ranges, and the pass (of less than 1,000&#13;
m) that separates the east and west portions of the isthmus.&#13;
1.2          Georgia was the first of the non-Baltic states to declare independence from the Former&#13;
Soviet Union (FSU), on April 9, 1991. Formal contacts between the World Bank and the Republic of&#13;
Georgia (hereinafter referred to as Georgia) began in March 1992, and the country joined the World Bank&#13;
in August 1992. One year later, Georgia joined the International Development Association (IDA).&#13;
1.3          At the time of its independence, Georgia appeared to be a relatively well-off republic with&#13;
fairly good potential for growth. Its sources of strength were its educated labor force, its long tradition&#13;
of entrepreneurship, the existence of a significant underground economy, non-negligible private sector&#13;
activity in agriculture, tourism on the Black Sea coast, and mineral and natural resources. Furthermore,&#13;
the country's location made it a primary transit conduit for goods, providing important access to and from&#13;
the Black Sea for Armenia, Azerbaijan, Central Asia, and Iran.&#13;
1.4          Soon after its independence, however, the country became embroiled in political and civil&#13;
strife. The consequences have had a devastating effect on the nation's economy, infrastructure and social&#13;
stability, further compounding the difficult transition to a market economy. Conflicts in Ossetia, located&#13;
in north-central Georgia, resulted in numerous casualties and refugees; since 1992, peace-keeping forces&#13;
have stabilized the situation. A separatist war in Abkhazia continued throughout 1992-1993, resulting&#13;
in an estimated 260,000 refugees migrating to other parts of Georgia, including Tbilisi and the coastal&#13;
cities of Poti and Batumi. During the same period, the Government also fought armed supporters of a&#13;
previous administration, generating additional casualties and destruction. A cease-fire in Abkhazia is now&#13;
in effect, and although the Government does not control the region, an agreement involving Russia and&#13;
the United Nations has been signed to work out a peaceful solution of the conflict. Georgia joined the&#13;
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Russian peacekeeping forces are now in Abkhazia to&#13;
work out the return of refugees to the province and to reopen the route to Russia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                           1. Country and Sector Background&#13;
B. Macroeconomic Background&#13;
1.5          Georgia currently remains in the trough of a recession, and much of the country's&#13;
agricultural and industrial plant stays idle. At present, it ranks among the poorest countries of the FSU&#13;
with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita estimated at about US$410 in 1994. The decline in&#13;
production began in 1989 but has been particularly sharp since 1991. In the period 1991-1993, GDP fell&#13;
by a cumulative total of 70%, affecting all sectors. The causes of the recession are many and to a large&#13;
extent inter-linked: civil war; disruption of traditional trade patterns; lack of foreign exchange; hyper-&#13;
inflation until July of 1994; and an all pervasive shortage of energy.&#13;
1.6          Extemal trade with the states of the FSU used to play a big role in the Georgian&#13;
economy. Total external trade (average of imports and exports) amounted to almost 43% of GDP in&#13;
1988-1990, with inter-republican trade accounting for about 86% of total trade. Georgia relied heavily&#13;
on imports of energy from other republics, notably Russia (for electricity and crude oil) and Turkmnenistan&#13;
(natural gas). Imported energy amounted to about 80% of the total energy supply in 1990. Wheat,&#13;
sugar, and some heavy machinery were the other major imports. Exports included citrus, tea, tobacco,&#13;
wine and mineral water. By far the biggest trading partner was Russia.&#13;
1.7          In 1991-1993, trade with the other FSU republics and the rest of the world collapsed.&#13;
This was due to several factors, which include the self-imposed embargo on trade with other republics&#13;
following the declaration of independence, the general breakdown of the trade channels in the FSU, the&#13;
disruption of transport routes due to the fighting in Abkhazia and Ossetia, the disruption of production&#13;
from input shortages, and the disintegration of the state order system. Today, there is some improvement&#13;
as active trade with neighboring countries, in particular Turkey, is taking place, although it remains&#13;
largely unrecorded. Although the importance of oil and gas increased greatly as a share of total imports,&#13;
enery shortages have been acute, sharply affecting industry, agriculture and transportation.&#13;
1.8          Georgia, until April 1993, used the Soviet ruble as its currency. Inflation, low before&#13;
1991, increased to reach about 120% in 1991 and almost 1,000% in 1992. In early 1993, as a step&#13;
towards creating its own currency, the Government issued "coupons" valued at par with the ruble and&#13;
circulating in parallel with it. The inflationary process accelerated, however, and the "coupon" soon lost&#13;
its value. By August 1993, it had sunk to 1/6 of the ruble, and at the end of 1993, the annual rate of&#13;
inflation had reached 8,400% and was ten times that of Russia. The depreciation of the coupon continued&#13;
thereafter and was finally halted by the stabilization program initiated in the Fall of 1994. After&#13;
appreciating from 5 million coupons per dollar to 1.3 million coupons per dollar at the end of 1994, the&#13;
exchange rate has stabilized, and in July 1995, the exchange rates were 260 coupons to the rouble and&#13;
1.3 million to the dollar. Effectively, only the ruble, the dollar and other hard currencies were being used&#13;
for trade and as a unit of account, and very few commodities besides food stuffs could be purchased with&#13;
the coupon. This situation has changed since the introduction of the new national currency, the Lari, in&#13;
September, 1995.&#13;
1.9          The economic recession has had a major impact on the state-controlled sector. Major&#13;
structural changes are taking place spontaneously, without any explicit policy intent on the part of the&#13;
Government. Salient examples are the slow disappearance of functions traditionally performed by the&#13;
civil service. This contraction of the civil service, apart from an intended reduction in state employment&#13;
levels, is also the result of a rapid loss in the purchasing power of governmental salaries. Those who&#13;
can find something more remunerative to do move on, with the predictable result that institutional&#13;
capacity is being reduced in a haphazard and disruptive fashion, faster than the level of Government&#13;
employment. In this context, for instance, the Ministry of Transport was dismantled in early 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1. Country and Sector Background                                                             3&#13;
1.10          Furthermore, the drop in the supply of goods and services by the public sector has&#13;
prompted the informal private sector to respond. This growth of an unrecorded economy is amplified&#13;
by the fact that Georgians have long had an entrepreneurial tradition and such response is rooted in&#13;
ancient history. The case of fuel is a relevant example. Prior to the liberalization of fuel prices, fuel at&#13;
controlled prices was not available, while fuel sold directly from "importing" trucks was widely available&#13;
at a market price quoted in hard currency for foreigners and in Russian rubles for the local population.&#13;
The price of a gallon of gasoline approaches world prices: in July 1995, it was comparable to the price&#13;
of gasoline in Washington D.C. at that time. The same entrepreneurial response is evident throughout&#13;
the economy, with small shops, bakeries, garages, car rental services appearing spontaneously despite&#13;
difficult conditions.&#13;
1.11          Recent developments. Since the beginning of 1994, the Government has begun to&#13;
consolidate its control over the country. There is some improvement in the law and order situation, and&#13;
a new governmental team has renewed efforts to rebuild the economy through market-oriented reforms.&#13;
Besides macroeconomic stabilization, progress has already been made in implementing structural reforms&#13;
in several areas. Small-scale enterprise privatization has already reached 90 % of enterprises, most prices&#13;
have been liberalized, and the import regime is relatively open. Georgia is initiating a comprehensive&#13;
program of stabilization policies and structural reforms, however, under very difficult conditions and&#13;
stringent financial constraints. Without drastic measures, as well as strong conmmitment to reforms on&#13;
every level of Government, it will be difficult to achieve success in this process.&#13;
C. The Transport Sector&#13;
1.12          A detailed description of the structure and investment priorities of the transport sector in&#13;
Georgia, and an action plan for policy and institutional reforms, are presented in the Transport Sector&#13;
Memorandum (TSM -- Report No. 13978-GZ, dated May 26, 1995) prepared by the Bank in&#13;
collaboration with Georgian authorities and other international institutions.  Agreement with its&#13;
recommendations has been confirmed by the Government of Georgia in a Letter of Sector Development&#13;
Policy, which has been attached to the minutes of negotiations (see paras. 2.12(b) and 3.15).&#13;
The Transport Sector Before Independence&#13;
1.13          Prior to independence, Georgia's transport system was closely integrated with that of the&#13;
FSU, and the country served as an important transit channel for the other republics. Land trade with the&#13;
FSU was mostly by rail, estimated in 1988 at 37.8 million tons, but another 2 million tons moved by&#13;
truck. Georgia's two principal cargo ports (Batumi and Poti)' moved 11.5 million tons of cargo in 1988;&#13;
85 % of this cargo, in value terms, was cabotage traffic to other parts of the FSU.&#13;
1.14          Not only was Georgia's transport system oriented to the FSU but the characteristics of&#13;
the system were determined by central authorities in Moscow and reflected patterns encountered&#13;
throughout the FSU. These included: (a) overuse of transportation because of specialization of production&#13;
in a few locations; (b) over-reliance on rail transport, especially for short hauls and for moving cargo to&#13;
and from ports; (c) centralized control of investments affecting all international transport; (d) undoubted&#13;
1/     The third port Sukhumi, located in Abkhazia, was essentially a passenger port (see para 1.54).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                              I. Country and Sector Background&#13;
technical competence of administrative and managerial structures coupled with unfamiliarity of&#13;
benefit/cost or other market-based analyses; and (e) the almost exclusive use of transport equipment made&#13;
within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) trading area, equipment that typically was&#13;
not competitive by world market criteria.&#13;
1.15          Georgia also made use of the same institutional arrangements for its transport system that&#13;
were the pattern generally in the FSU: the Ministry of Transport received budgetary proposals of various&#13;
enterprises in the transport sector, setting their charging policies and the level of mandatory payments&#13;
to the Government, authorizing investments and providing support from general government finances if&#13;
revenues were inadequate. In addition, maritime and aviation fleets were based in ports or airports and&#13;
operated as combined enterprises with them; freight booking and follow-up was handled through central&#13;
organizations; transport enterprises typically provided many social services (health, education, etc.) to&#13;
their staff at little or no cost; and the design, construction and maintenance of roads and other&#13;
infrastructure was carried out by units which were not subject to competition.&#13;
1.16          Up to 1990, Georgian statistical authorities compiled summaries of the performance of&#13;
the transport system based on reports from various operators, whether they functioned on a "for hire"&#13;
or "own account" basis. With some privatization and with a general decline in discipline, the reporting&#13;
system has now broken down, and sample surveys have not yet been instituted on a routine basis.&#13;
The Transport Sector Today&#13;
1.17          Today, Georgia still retains much of the Soviet-style transport system, concerning&#13;
institutions and procedures, but without the funding that it enjoyed in the Soviet era.  Physical&#13;
manifestations of the shortcomings of this system abound across the sector:&#13;
lack of resources for all the modes;&#13;
*      an eroding asset base;&#13;
-      lack of technical innovation and upgrading;&#13;
*      absence of a meaningful statistical base for the sector; and&#13;
absence of reliable financial indicators.&#13;
1.18          Asset Base. Little, if any, maintenance (even basic routine maintenance) has been done&#13;
in all sub-sectors except air transport since 1991. This is the case, for instance, of critical transport&#13;
infrastructure assets such as the main road system (the main east-west road from Azerbaijan to the Black&#13;
Sea coast and north-south from the Armenian to Russian borders) which is deteriorating badly, of several&#13;
railway bridges which are near collapse, and of crucial port infrastructure. This eroding asset base may,&#13;
within the next five years, deteriorate to the point at which maintenance and rehabilitation are no longer&#13;
possible. If this occurs, the only option will be costly and complete reconstruction.&#13;
1.19          Worsening the picture, the conflict in Abkhazia severely damaged road and particularly&#13;
railway infrastructure: several bridges were blown up on the critical link between the Black Sea ports and&#13;
eastern Georgia; railway electric wires were vandalized, and the signalization system was destroyed.&#13;
1.20          Traffic. The transport sector was particularly affected by the economic downturn of the&#13;
last four years in Georgia. Today, traffic flows in all modes are significantly reduced when compared&#13;
with those of only a few years ago. Less than one fourth of 1990 levels were observed in 1993. In&#13;
addition, most of the remaining traffic for ports and rail is humanitarian food-aid cargo, and such traffic&#13;
is temporary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1. Country and Sector Background                                                                    5&#13;
1.21           Transit traffic also fell drastically from 204,000 tons in 1989 to 22,800 tons in 1991 and&#13;
with further reductions since, although transit traffic has recovered somewhat due, again, to shipment of&#13;
humanitarian assistance to Armenia and Azerbaijan through Georgia. Figures 1. 1, 1.2 and 1.3 below give&#13;
an indication of freight traffic decline in roads, ports and rail.&#13;
1.22           Since independence from the FSU, Georgia has aspired to a role as the western and&#13;
crucial link in a land corridor for trade between Europe and Asia, by providing transit facilities for oil&#13;
and gas pipelines from central Asia, and container transit traffic for trade between Europe and central and&#13;
eastern Asia, and the Persian Gulf. Today, Georgia envisages not only the transit revenues but also the&#13;
impetus to domestic ancillary activities that transit trade would generate.&#13;
1.23           A shift in external trade relations is already taking place. Although cargo turnover&#13;
remains very low, the quantity, range and origins of the comrnmodities handled at Poti port have become&#13;
more diversified. The outward shipment of ores through Poti has now stopped, and trade with Turkey&#13;
and countries in the Mediterranean has increased. The possible competition by corridors through Russia,&#13;
and through Turkey and Armenia, needs to be kept in mind: the significance of transit traffic for the&#13;
Railway and ports would grow in tandem with an easing of tensions in the Caucasus region.&#13;
1.24           Financial Aspects. Since Government revenues have decreased significantly, from about&#13;
25 % to 3 % of a much smaller GDP base, most transport enterprises are having to rely on self-generated&#13;
funds to cover their urgent needs, i.e., to provide essential spares and replacements for maintenance of&#13;
existing operations. With the exception of urban transport, transport enterprises are not receiving official&#13;
"subsidies" anymore2. As for the Highway Concern, it has not received any payments from the state&#13;
budget, has not been able to maintain the road network and has difficulties paying its staff.&#13;
1.25           Budgeting arrangements for the four transport modes of the erstwhile Ministry, now that&#13;
they report directly to a Deputy Prime Minister, do not exist. It is also clear that under present&#13;
conditions, transport enterprises in Georgia, whatever the formal designation of their financial status, are&#13;
not maintaining their assets and are depleting their capital stock.&#13;
1.26           Institutional Aspects.  Institutionally, the sector is in disarray.  The Ministry of&#13;
Transport was dismantled in early 1994. Four modal agencies for rail, road transport, ports and air&#13;
report directly to a Deputy Prime Minister responsible for the infrastructure sectors, and a fifth, (the road&#13;
infrastructure sub-sector) reports to the Council of Ministers. This structure is expected to be adjusted&#13;
under the new Government, the modal agencies will continue to be responsible for policy and regulatory&#13;
functions. In addition, under the modal agencies there exist operational units. These are public entities,&#13;
established by law which requires them to conduct their activities in accordance with Georgian Corporate&#13;
Law.  There is no reliable, consistent, information base, and transport statistics are not being&#13;
systematically collected.&#13;
1.27           The Ministry of Transport was abolished in 1994 in the context of a needed contraction&#13;
in the civil service, with more and more responsibilities concentrated in fewer hands. This trend has&#13;
adversely affected the ability of policy-makers to formulate sector policy, carry out reforms and adjust&#13;
to new realities. The sector, with the exception of the aviation sub-sector, still operates under the&#13;
organizational and policy structures of earlier days. Since the restoration of the Soviet-style civil service&#13;
2/     The terms 'profit" 'loss" and "subsidy' as used in the former Soviet system do not correspond to accounting concepts&#13;
in the industrialized world, most notably because Soviet accounting made no provision for either compensation of capital or&#13;
reserves for depreciation.&#13;

I. Country and Sector Background                                                               7&#13;
would not be advisable, this presents a unique opportunity to organize reforms and privatize the sector.&#13;
Improved sector performance is indispensable for the economy to recover, and the sector may need to&#13;
be restructured and market-oriented to be able to perform under increasing traffic volumes. In an effort&#13;
to focus and accelerate efforts to reform the sector, two State Committees have been recently formed&#13;
under the authority of the Chief of State with somewhat overlapping responsibilities. They are a&#13;
Transport Coordination Committee (TCC), dealing with domestic transport issues, and the Transport&#13;
Reform and Rehabilitation Center (TRRC), responsible for trans-caucasian transport issues. Both entities&#13;
are involved in project implementation (see Annex 13, page 1), the TRRC as coordinator of the project,&#13;
and the TCC as a participant in the project steering group.&#13;
1.28          Recent Developments. As part of the efforts undertaken by the current governmental&#13;
team to rebuild the economy through market-oriented reforms (see para. 1. I1), some encouraging changes&#13;
are already taking place in the transport sector. The aviation sub-sector was restructured in 1994, with&#13;
the Aviation Department acting as a regulatory body, and airports, airlines, and air traffic control (ATC)&#13;
operating under commercial principles as separate entities.  In addition, some steps towards&#13;
commercialization of ports have occurred, a program of privatization of road transport entities is&#13;
underway, and a recent decree reorganized the road transport sub-sector, liberalizing it and defining a&#13;
regulatory body. The implementation of the road transport privatization program started in April 1995,&#13;
and about 75% of the assets were privatized in November, 1995 (see paras. 2.11 (a)), and laws on&#13;
foreign investments and road user charges were approved in July and September 1995.&#13;
1.29          Remaining Issues. Despite these efforts, many issues remain to be addressed, both&#13;
institutionally and regarding the necessary rehabilitation of the key transport infrastructure of Georgia.&#13;
Institutionally, the issues refer to commercialization, deregulation and further privatization in the sector&#13;
with attendant restructuring of operational units concerned. On the rehabilitation side, the issues refer&#13;
to the need for cost recovery, giving priority to the maintenance of critical sections, and improving&#13;
technologies in use to reduce unit costs of operations and civil works. The deterioration of the transport&#13;
system is affecting other economic sectors that rely upon transport. If not addressed, this deterioration&#13;
is likely to create transport bottlenecks which will further discourage economic activity and would need&#13;
to be removed as a matter of urgency.&#13;
D. Transport Sub-Sectors&#13;
1.30          The following paragraphs describe the current physical situation of each of the transport&#13;
sub-sectors (roads, railway and ports), as well as on traffic levels, past (significant), current (depressed)&#13;
and prospective (limited growth). Chapter III - Financial Analysis presents information on the financial&#13;
situation of the Highway Concern and the Railway Department.&#13;
Road Infrastructure&#13;
1.31          The dominant institution in the road construction and maintenance sub-sector is the&#13;
Highway Concern, a public entity with management autonomy, that operates independently of the rest&#13;
of the transport sector, reporting directly to the Council of Ministers.&#13;
1.32          The Road System. The total length of the Georgian road network consists of 21,600 km&#13;
of roads, of which 9,720 are paved and 11,800 are gravel or earth. The road system of Georgia in the&#13;
Soviet era was oriented essentially for trade with other republics of the Union, to the east (Azerbaijan),&#13;
but more importantly to the north (the Russian Federation). The aspirations of Georgia as an independent&#13;
nation, and specifically the possibility of becoming part of an east-west corridor linking the Caucasus and&#13;
central Asia with the Black Sea, require a radically different emphasis for the road system from that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                           1. Country and Sector Back round&#13;
previously envisaged, one in which the road from the Azeri border to Georgia's Black Sea ports would&#13;
play the dominant role.&#13;
1.33          The Principal Road Through Georgia: "The Magisterial". The principal road in&#13;
Georgia, measuring about 728 kIn, runs from the Azeri border, through Tbilisi, to the Black Sea&#13;
(Sukhumi), and on to the Russian border. At Samtredia, close to the Black Sea, two roads take off from&#13;
the Magisterial to provide access to the ports of Poti and Batumi. The Magisterial runs generally along&#13;
the valley between the two ranges of the Caucasus.&#13;
1.34          Geometry. The alignment, longitudinal gradients and slope stability of this principal&#13;
highway are generally acceptable except for two mountainous sections (100 km west of Tbilisi, and in&#13;
the area of Rustavi, the major industrial complex, between the Azeri border and Tbilisi). The Magisterial&#13;
is however beset by long tangents (straights) that may cause problems from headlights at night and that&#13;
certainly encourage speeding by drivers of automobiles.&#13;
1.35          Pavement. Apart from a few short concrete sections in and adjacent to the cities, the&#13;
Magisterial pavement is of flexible construction. The bituminous surfacing looks dry, potholes have&#13;
appeared, there is some evidence of use of uncrushed gravel, and of stripping, but there is no widespread&#13;
deformation of surface that would indicate base or formation failure; probably the relatively high&#13;
embankments on which the road has been constructed have helped to keep the critical pavement strata&#13;
dry and hence conserve their strength. The lane markings are faded to the point of not being visible any&#13;
longer. The standard design for the pavement is a total depth of 30 cm (5 cm of carpet, 5 cm of&#13;
bituminous base and a stone base of 20 cm). This construction is adequate for today's reduced traffic,&#13;
but less so if and when previous traffic levels return or if there were to be an increase in heavy traffic&#13;
from the central Asia region.&#13;
1.36          Structures. The structures, principally bridge decks, piers, abutments and wing walls, are&#13;
characterized by thoroughly poor concrete. The side elevations of the decks exemplify the problem --&#13;
crumbling concrete and reinforcement exposed. This shortcoming carries over to railway overpasses. The&#13;
condition of the concrete could be attributable to working in frosty conditions, or to use of ingredients&#13;
that have chemicals inimical to concrete, or to skimping on the cement content, but more likely the&#13;
condition is the result of poor compaction or even the total absence of compaction.&#13;
1.37          A further negative feature associated with the bridges, is inattention to the side drains in&#13;
the cuttings that form the approaches to the structures. These approaches, and therefore the side drains,&#13;
are often steep, but there appears to be no practice to protect the drains either by lining or by use of&#13;
scour checks, with the consequence that the drains are deeply scarred into the shoulders of the road, and&#13;
the wing walls of abutments tend to be undercut.&#13;
1.38          Other Roads. The remaining roads comprise secondary and tertiary roads leading off&#13;
the Magisterial, and feeder/agricultural roads and tracks. The secondary/tertiary system also is in poor&#13;
condition. The limited means now at the disposal of the Highway Concern, however, are concentrated&#13;
on the "magisterial" road in preference to the other roads.&#13;
1.39         The lowest class roads (feeder roads, agricultural roads and tracks) are important to move&#13;
agricultural inputs and produce. Because of lack of funds, these vital access roads are not being&#13;
maintained. According to the staff of NGOs assisting agricultural development, lack of farm to market&#13;
access roads is the second most significant impediment to agricultural development, after the lack of&#13;
agricultural inputs and energy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. Country and Sector Background                                                        9&#13;
1.40         Traffic.  Based on counts from the engineers of the Highway Concern whose&#13;
construction/maintenance units are positioned along the Magisterial, current traffic levels are in the range&#13;
of 250-500 vehicles per day (vpd), down from previous levels of up to 10,000 vpd. These latter flows&#13;
could materialize again as agricultural activity in eastern Georgia and in the western plain, and industrial&#13;
activity in Kutaisi, Tbilisi and Rustavi resumes. There is no credible evidence, however, that this&#13;
recovery is imminent. The concept of Georgia being part of the Central Asia-Black Sea corridor, if it&#13;
materializes, would obviously augment the flow on the Magisterial, probably with container traffic; at&#13;
best, and certainly in the short term, this transit traffic would only be a small proportion of the locally-&#13;
generated flow. Since May, 1995, a moderate increase of this traffic has become apparent.&#13;
1.41         Maintenance and Rehabilitation. Work on the road system as a whole is virtually non-&#13;
existent, a result of lack of funds and cost recovery from users. The funding currently available does not&#13;
even cover all wages and salaries of Highway Concern employees. The Legislation approved on&#13;
September 2, 1995 (para. 1.28), introduces a new cost recovery and road user charges system to finance&#13;
road maintenance and rehabilitation. However, this system introduces some distortions to the "road user&#13;
= road payer" principle, in the form of discriminatory taxation between local and foreign road users.&#13;
Adjustments to correct this situation will be made later, in light of the recommendations of a Pavement&#13;
Management Study (see paras. 2.11 (c), 3.4, and 5.1 (e)). Competitive contracting of both maintenance&#13;
and construction of new roads would help to lower unit costs, but privatization of these operations would&#13;
require an appropriate and steady level of funding.&#13;
1.42         Maintenance Units and Equipment. Few of the 14 road construction and repair units&#13;
and of the 88 road maintenance units appear to be in working condition. Maintenance equipment is of&#13;
rather heavy design, and capacity to mix and lay bituminous base and carpet is far larger than the&#13;
construction and maintenance function would dictate. Possibly road maintenance units in the past had&#13;
received equipment that happened to be available and not necessarily that which was needed.&#13;
1.43         Private Sector Participation. Today, there are intentions to privatize road construction&#13;
and maintenance, with eventual divestiture of related assets, and requests for assistance have been made&#13;
to the Bank. This has been explicitly included as part of the project (see paras. 2.11 (c), and Annexes&#13;
8 and 19).&#13;
The Rail Sub-Sector&#13;
1.44         The Railway Department is a public entity operating under Georgian Corporate Law.&#13;
At its peak (in the mid 80's), it had 41,000 employees - 18,000 in transport operations and 23,000 in&#13;
support and social functions. At that time, annual freight traffic was in excess of 40 million tons. Today,&#13;
the downturn in activity has brought total staff to about 18,000, and freight traffic to only 5 to 6 million&#13;
tons.&#13;
1.45         Infrastructure and Equipment. Georgia has 1,569 km of railways. The main line&#13;
between Poti and Tbilisi dates back to 1872 but other lines were built as recently as 1970. Currently,&#13;
most of the country lies within 50 km of a railway line, and the densely populated areas are in the 20 km&#13;
catchment of the railways. About 80% of the network is in mountainous terrain with grades reaching&#13;
4.9%; 247 km have curves with radii of less than 300 m. The main lines are all electrified (Georgia&#13;
was the first republic of the FSU to undertake the electrification of its railway network) with DC at 3.3&#13;
kv.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                         I. Country and Sector Background&#13;
1.46         The condition of the network and related civil engineering structures is poor (see Annex&#13;
12 for a detailed description). Tracks are old, embankments are not well maintained, overhead lines are&#13;
in need of repair; most structures and buildings are more than 80 years old. Many sections are subject&#13;
to slow orders, and communications are difficult because of stolen wires. In addition, the Railway was&#13;
adversely affected by the unrest in Abkhazia: the track to the north and Russia remains closed because&#13;
of physical damage; specifically, the complete destruction of two bridges and severe damage to several&#13;
others, as well as vandalized electric wires and signalization equipment. Although main lines are&#13;
electrified, poor power supply and vandalized equipment have made electric locomotives and trains&#13;
unreliable.&#13;
1.47         The rolling stock of Georgian Railways was supplied from the erstwhile Soviet system,&#13;
which purchased its requirements not only within the FSU but from suppliers elsewhere in the CMEA&#13;
and even in Western Europe and Japan. Little of this non-CMEA equipment, however, was passed on&#13;
to Georgia. The main traction equipment consists of a total of 496 units, of which 280 were reported&#13;
in working order in May, 1995. This includes 230 (in working condition: 110) electric locomotives --&#13;
mostly assembled at a plant in Georgia --, 159 (90) diesel-electric locomotives and 107 (80) electric&#13;
motorized units (EMU). Of nearly 20,000 freight wagons in 1991, about 5,000 were said to be out of&#13;
use in 1993, and in May, 1995, only 5,000 were reported in operation.&#13;
1.48         The low availability of rolling stock is due to: (i) delayed maintenance (about 90% of the&#13;
locomotives need periodic overhaul, work that was normally done in Russia but has until recently been&#13;
impossible due to political conditions); (ii) lack of spares (the Railway does not have the hard currency&#13;
to procure them); and (iii) operational and organizational flaws.&#13;
1.49         Traffic. In 1988, nearly 13 billion ton.km moved by rail. Today (in 1994 and in the first&#13;
half of 1995), this number barely exceeds 1 billion ton.km per year. Most of the remaining traffic is&#13;
grain, flour and liquid fuel, as part of the emergency assistance for maintaining food and energy supplies&#13;
to Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.&#13;
1.50         Collapse of traffic on Georgian Railways reflects weak demand but also the lack of&#13;
railway capacity. Both have been declining but not necessarily on parallel paths. The problems in&#13;
railway operations include slow-orders on track and unserviceable rolling stock, both of which reduce&#13;
the movement of trains and the supply of wagons to customers. For example, a typical transit time from&#13;
Poti to Tbilisi is 17 hours for 324 km (for an average operational speed of 19 km/hr), and the Railway&#13;
cannot supply more than 100 grain wagons per day to either Batumi or Poti port for unloading of ships.&#13;
Wagon turn-around times (in days) also have deteriorated sharply from about a week in 1992 to more&#13;
than two weeks today.&#13;
1.51         These statistics, and the complaints from users since 1994, point to the possibility of&#13;
further declines of railway service in Georgia. If the urgent maintenance and rehabilitation and&#13;
managerial needs are not met, the Railway will not be able to cover such basic needs as fuel and food&#13;
supply, let alone new traffic once economic activity picks up.&#13;
1.52         External Assistance. The Railway is benefitting - both financially and operationally -&#13;
from the United Nations World Food Program (WFP), and specifically from the work of its Caucasus&#13;
Logistics Advisory Unit (CLAU); the latter has representatives in Tbilisi, Batumi, Yerevan and Baku.&#13;
Through its primary concern for movement of food shipments, WFP/CLAU is impacting beneficially on&#13;
operation of the railway system (and of the ports) by its continuous and obviously very professional,&#13;
"hands-on" diagnoses of operational shortcomings. WFP, to add force to its diagnoses, has provided&#13;
funding for the leasing of 10 diesel locomotives in 1994, and has programmed US$4.5 million of grant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. Country and Sector Background                                                            11&#13;
funding for the Railway for 1995. Furthermore, CLAU issues periodical "Situation Reports" analyzing&#13;
the general logistical situation in the Caucasus, and specifically the situation in the ports and on the&#13;
Railway. These situation reports have become the only reliable source of current information on&#13;
transport. Also, the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) has funded technical assistance&#13;
to make a detailed assessment of the physical and technical condition of the Railway, as a first step&#13;
towards the determination of future assistance levels. This work has been recently completed.&#13;
Ports&#13;
1.53          Georgia has three ports, Batumi near the Turkish border, Sukhumi in the West, not far&#13;
from the Russian border, and Poti in the central coastal plain. Sukhumi is in Abkhazia and is reported&#13;
to have been used in the past primarily for passenger traffic and to have only limited cargo facilities.&#13;
Operations at Sukhumi have been affected by the unrest in Abkhazia. The territory around the other two&#13;
ports is also subject to some political constraints. Batumi is the capital of the (former Soviet) Adzhar&#13;
autonomous Republic, which still has certain differences with the Central Government, while Poti lies&#13;
in the Mingrelia region.&#13;
1.54          In 1994, Batumi handled only about 0.7 million tons of dry cargo, whereas Poti's dry&#13;
throughput was at 1I.1 million tons. Today, most of the dry cargo handled by both ports (95 % of the total&#13;
in Batumi, and 89% in Poti) is the humanitarian food aid for Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Almost&#13;
no liquid cargo moved through the ports in 1994. This low level of traffic contrasts with past pattemrs:&#13;
Batumi's throughput in 1988 of 6.9 million tons was about three-quarters in petroleum and petroleum&#13;
products and the rest of Batumi's cargo in 1989 (no data available for 1988) was nearly all in grain and&#13;
alumina with only 0.2 million tons represented by other dry cargo. Poti, on the other hand, handled no&#13;
bulk liquids, but 70% of the 4.4 million tons of dry cargo in 1989 was in four commodities (grain, ores,&#13;
bauxite and coal).&#13;
1.55          The role of the ports is likely to change. During the era of the FSU, Batumi and Poti&#13;
served mainly traffic to and from other Soviet republics, but now they are expecting to provide a channel&#13;
for an increasing volume of imports to the Caucasian republics from the world market and for exports&#13;
of the products of these republics, most importantly oil. The ports are expecting also to serve the transit&#13;
traffic to and from central Asia and beyond and to and from Iran and other countries in the near and&#13;
middle East.&#13;
1.56          Current Situation at Batumi and Poti. This assessment of the situation at Batumi and&#13;
Poti is based on World Bank findings in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and reflects the remedies suggested by&#13;
the US Embassy in Tbilisi and WFP/CLAU.3 Both of these sources rightly touch on the role of the&#13;
Railway as it affects port operation.&#13;
1.57          At both ports, the general impression remains that the facilities available, if properly&#13;
operated to maximum capacity, should be able to accommodate current traffic and any traffic growth&#13;
foreseeable in the medium-term, without the need for major investments. The longer-term flows at the&#13;
ports will depend on (i) the timing and magnitude of the economic recovery, and (ii) the extent to which&#13;
Georgia will be used as a transit corridor for trade to and from central Asia. In this context it should be&#13;
noted that Georgian ports may face competition from Turkish ports on the Black Sea, the latter sending&#13;
their traffic by rail through Armenia by-passing Georgia. Certainly for movement of oil from Georgian&#13;

ports, the concern of Turkey over the passage of laden tankers through the Bosphorus will also need to&#13;
be addressed.&#13;
1.58          At Batumi (five oil berths and one off-shore oil terminal, four dry cargo berths, an&#13;
offshore mooring for lightering, and a small container handling capacity) there is limited dry cargo&#13;
storage, hence virtually all discharging is direct, primarily to rail. This is a shortcoming of port design,&#13;
the lack of railway wagons constraining port throughput. The oil pipeline across Georgia is corroded and&#13;
remains closed, hence oil has had to move by rail. The principal operational problems at Batumi persist&#13;
as (i) inability of rail to provide adequate and timely wagonage for evacuation of cargoes, (ii) a work&#13;
force with little motivation, (iii) an inadequate and unpredictable electric power supply, and (iv) lack of&#13;
spares for cranes and handling equipment.&#13;
1.59          At Poti, the cargo terminal has ten berths (two for grain, six for other bulk, one for&#13;
containers, and one for general cargo) all served by rail. There are additionally a passenger berth, two&#13;
fishing piers, one berth for coastal traffic and one being rehabilitated. The principal operational problems&#13;
are similar to those at Batumi: (i) the inability of the Railway to adequately serve the port, and (ii)&#13;
uncertainties and interruptions in the electric power supply. The port has a stand-by generator, but this&#13;
in turn is beset by periodic lack of fuel. Poti has an advantage in its working areas behind the berths&#13;
being more spacious than those at Batumi, which is surrounded by a densely-settled community and&#13;
hemmed in at the foot of steeply-rising mountains. Unlike Batumi, however, Poti has the problem of&#13;
littoral drift, and maintenance dredging is needed. Since 1993, Poti has been contracting a foreign&#13;
company to dredge the approach channel to 12 m and to make corresponding adjustments alongside the&#13;
berths. Using its own resources, the port of Poti spent about US$ 0.9 million in 1994 for dredging, and&#13;
is planning to spend an additional US$ 2 million in 1995 to continue dredging maintenance of the access&#13;
channel.&#13;
1.60         External Assistance. GTZ has recently financed and completed field work to define an&#13;
in-depth study of the technical and institutional conditions of the ports, their potential for development,&#13;
and required assistance for institutional reform, rehabilitation, and private sector participation. A formal&#13;
agreement with the Government of Georgia to carry out this work is expected in the near future. In&#13;
addition, EBRD has identified a Grain Terminal Project in Poti which would have private sector&#13;
participation.&#13;
E. Bank's Experience and Strategy&#13;
Bank's Role and Past Experience in Georgia&#13;
1.61         The intention of the reform program of the Georgian Government has been to reverse the&#13;
economic decline of the past few years and to move to a private sector led, market-based economy.&#13;
Through the end of 1993, however, given the civil conflict and resulting lack of focus and impossibility&#13;
to send Bank missions, lending from the Bank was not feasible. Instead, the focus was on building&#13;
macroeconomic and sector knowledge and providing limited technical assistance to the extent possible.&#13;
1.62         In response to the Govermnent's new focus on economic reform, the Bank has initiated&#13;
a broader program of lending and sector work in municipal infrastructure, energy, health, agriculture,&#13;
transport and environrment. Three lending operations were approved in FY 1995: The Institution Building&#13;
Credit (US$10.1 million, approved by the Board in July 1994), which provides support to the country's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. Country and Sector Background                                                              13&#13;
privatization efforts, financial sector reform, tax and customs administration strengthening, and economic&#13;
policy development; the Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation Credit (US$18 million, approved in&#13;
November 1994); and the Rehabilitation Credit (US$75 million, approved in March, 1995) which&#13;
supports the Government's economic reform program, aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability and&#13;
at promoting the resumption of growth and improvement in living standards.  The Transport&#13;
Rehabilitation Project will be the first operation of the Bank to support essential needs of transport&#13;
infrastructure in Georgia.&#13;
Bank's Assistance Strategy in the Transport Sector&#13;
1.63          The need for assistance to Georgia's transport sector is substantial. The macro economic&#13;
situation, the role of transport in assisting supply responses to policy reform (see para. 1.39), and&#13;
regional trade being one of Georgia's comparative advantages, give a sense of extreme urgency to this&#13;
assistance. The situation is quite desperate, aggravated by institutional breakdowns, financial imbalances,&#13;
and the stoppage of practically all maintenance work. Support for rehabilitation and improvements in the&#13;
efficiency of the transport sector is a key element of the proposed 1996-1998 country assistance strategy&#13;
(CAS). These elements were also included in the lending strategy as outlined by the Rehabilitation Credit&#13;
approved by the Board in March 1995. The Bank discussed an action plan of sector reforms with the&#13;
Government in the context of the TSM (para. 1.12) in May 1995. The cornerstones of the discussed&#13;
medium-term assistance strategy are:&#13;
(a) Sector Policy Reform and Legal Frameworks: The sector institutions which will be assisted&#13;
range from the ministries and modal agencies formulating the sector's reform program, such as&#13;
ports, Railway, and the Highway Concern. The assistance will cover: formulation of legal&#13;
frameworks; attributions and functions of the sector institutions in a market economy;&#13;
restructuring of public enterprises in the sector to enable their independent operation in a&#13;
competitive environment and prepare their privatization; liberalization of transport and of freight&#13;
forwarding markets; and privatization of road freight and passenger transport.&#13;
(b) Privatization  or Commercialization  of Sector Enterprises:   The privatization and&#13;
commercialization of sector operations, and attendant restructuring, will help determine the&#13;
corporate structure and costs of viable transport enterprises. If left untouched, these enterprises&#13;
would not be credit worthy, would be unable to raise capital to assure their sustainability, and&#13;
would be candidates for liquidation.&#13;
(c) Cost Recovery for Transport Services and Infrastructure:  Cost recovery and financial&#13;
restructuring do not guarantee minimum transport costs. This can only result from competition&#13;
among suppliers of transport services within and across sub-sectors. Competition and market&#13;
determined prices will be ensured by liberalization of entry and pricing for transport services.&#13;
(d)  Maintenance and Rehabilitation of Key Infrastructure: Maintenance is the top priority,&#13;
followed by rehabilitation. Georgia should start considering investments in new infrastructure&#13;
only when the existing services are brought back to a reasonable level of operation and traffic has&#13;
started flowing again.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                           1. Country and Sector Background&#13;
1.64          In the short-term, the assistance strategy aims at:&#13;
*      The initiation of the institutional strengthening; and&#13;
*      Avoidance of potential capacity constraints by carrying out critical infrastructure&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
1.65          For rehabilitation and maintenance, the Bank's assistance strategy will primarily focus&#13;
on the roads, rail and, to a lesser extent, port sub-sectors. Civil aviation in Georgia is well on its way&#13;
towards reform and commercialization while following an "open skies" policy. In addition, two&#13;
operations, a recently approved EBRD-financed project of about $13 million for the refurbishing and&#13;
modernization of the Tbilisi terminal building, and a possibly private sector-funded project for the&#13;
rehabilitation and renewal of air traffic control, are currently under consideration.&#13;
1.66          For ports, there already exists private sector interest in rehabilitation investments. This&#13;
interest has not developed into concrete investments yet, mainly because of the lack of a legal framework&#13;
for foreign investment in Georgia, and because it would be pointless to increase current port capacity as&#13;
rail and road transport cannot match this capacity today.&#13;
1.67          The Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP) is the Bank's first response to the pressing&#13;
short term needs of the transport sector in Georgia. It will address directly existing bottlenecks and be&#13;
a catalyst for the adjustment of the sector and the restructuring of its institutions. The TRP will amount&#13;
to a necessary first step and will lay down the basis on which to develop a program of financial assistance&#13;
for transport once economic recovery is established.&#13;
1.68          Further support of rehabilitation, restructuring, and orientation towards a market economy&#13;
of operations in the sector could be assisted with additional lending over the next five years. The extent&#13;
of this medium term assistance would be subject to: (i) the successful implementation of the TRP; (ii)&#13;
economic recovery in neighboring countries and demand for transit services; and (iii) increased domestic&#13;
economic activity and transport demand.&#13;
1.69          In any case, technical assistance and training, so far accepted and welcomed by the&#13;
Government, have an obvious role to play. The continuation of current technical assistance and direct&#13;
operational support to maintain the flow of humanitarian aid to both Georgia and Armenia would be&#13;
needed during the transition to a more comprehensive approach to the sector's problems.&#13;
Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
1.70          Given that in the transport sector debt capacities are small and revenues limited, any&#13;
financing made available to the sector, and to Georgia generally, needs to be on concessional terms. Most&#13;
external donors are focusing their assistance efforts in Georgia almost exclusively on humanitarian aid.&#13;
Up to now, IDA is the only concessional source available to help finance programs to address the severe&#13;
transport dysfunctions in Georgia. Assistance from IDA will play a significant role in helping foster an&#13;
environment in which economic stabilization and growth can take root while laying the foundation for&#13;
improved management and operations in the transport sector.&#13;
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Projects in the Transport Sector&#13;
1.71          The Transport Rehabilitation Credit will be the first Bank/IDA transport project for&#13;
Georgia. The Bank's experience in the transport sector has been substantial over the last fifty years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. Country and Sector Background                                                              15&#13;
This experience has highlighted the need to address, in addition to investment needs: (i) the institutional&#13;
capacity to carry out the project; (ii) cost recovery mechanisms; (iii) policy reform; and (iv) emphasis&#13;
on maintenance and rehabilitation of existing assets. The project incorporates these experiences in its&#13;
design as exemplified, in particular, by recent developments in Eastern and Central Europe and Latin&#13;
America.&#13;
1.72          Traditionally, transport projects financed by the Bank have been designed to respond to&#13;
expanding demand for infrastructure and services. In Georgia, as in other economies in transition to a&#13;
market economy, this is not the case. Infrastructure is deteriorating, traffic is about a fourth of the&#13;
volume it used to be six years ago, and the public administration has been sharply reduced. Policy&#13;
making functions have suffered, and implementation capacity has been affected. This has led to a project&#13;
design which addresses the need to alleviate severe bottlenecks, while assisting the implementation of&#13;
broad-based policy and institutional reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin and Formulation&#13;
2.1           The Bank's involvement in the transport sector in Georgia started with two transport&#13;
sector review missions, in August 1993 and June 1994, which led to the Transport Sector Memorandum&#13;
report and policy note (Report No. 13978-GZ). In late 1994, the Government expressed interest in a&#13;
project to address the pressing rehabilitation needs of the transport system. The project was prepared&#13;
between May and August 1995. Project preparation addressed: (i) the policy and sector reform&#13;
recommendations of the Transport Sector Memorandum; and (ii) the possible composition of the&#13;
Transport Rehabilitation Credit. Project preparation has been assisted by a PHRD grant from the&#13;
Government of Japan. The project supports the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), has a favorable fiscal&#13;
impact on the basis of cost recovery measures, and makes substantial contributions to economic efficiency&#13;
in other sectors while reducing transport costs. An environmental analysis leading to a mitigation&#13;
program integral to the project has been carried out.&#13;
B. Project Rationale and Objectives&#13;
Project Rationale&#13;
2.2           The rationale for the project rests on the urgent need to avoid: (i) potential collapse of&#13;
the transport system; (ii) excessive transport costs; and (iii) early reconstruction of infrastructure.&#13;
Simultaneously, the project minimizes the risks of major accidents from the use of extremely damaged&#13;
road and rail networks, and assures the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Caucasus region.&#13;
2.3           The project scope also paves the way for a wide range of reforms in sector policy and&#13;
regulatory framework. As such it will address environment and safety issues, avoid service breakdowns,&#13;
and restore a minimum of safe physical capacity in road, rail, and port transport. Air transport, being&#13;
quite advanced in the development of its policy framework and in the updating of fixed facilities and&#13;
privatization of services, is not included in the Transport Rehabilitation Credit.&#13;
2.4           In identifying the project, the following questions were addressed:&#13;
(a)    Given the scarcity of resources, how best to address the significant road rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance backlog?&#13;
(b)    Is rail a truly viable option?&#13;
(c)    Should rail passenger traffic be stopped altogether to concentrate on freight and food aid?&#13;
(d)    Is there a long term need for the East-West railway or would the road suffice?&#13;
2.5           How to address the road rehabilitation backlog? Road is a key transport mode and traffic&#13;
has been increasing. Its importance can be expected to grow as the economies of the Caucasus republics&#13;
improve and local and international traffic develops. At this point, road repairs are needed as a priority&#13;
for safety reasons and to avoid the need for reconstruction. The government has not been able to make&#13;
the financial contributions sufficient to deal with the maintenance and rehabilitation backlog, estimated&#13;
as a minimum at US$85 million (see Annex 6, page 5). It is, therefore, proposed to allocate resources&#13;
to kick off a priority program of road repairs. It would consist initially of emergency works to stabilize&#13;
and avoid further destruction of about 1,000 km of the main road network of Georgia. Later, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1. The Project                                                                               17&#13;
resources generated by the recently approved cost recovery system become available, the Highway&#13;
Concem would start addressing the backlog of rehabilitation on main roads and of maintenance on&#13;
secondary roads, totalling about 7,000 km.&#13;
2.6           Is rail viable? Under the current conditions in Georgia, there is no alternative to rail for&#13;
the transport of humanitarian aid to Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. The road access to ports has&#13;
limited capacity for heavy trucking, and the truck fleet is also limited; the cost recovery system needed&#13;
to maintain the roads is not yet in place; and the destruction of the roads would be accelerated if the&#13;
Railway were to be closed. Selected expenditures to rehabilitate existing locomotives, maintain track to&#13;
minimum safety standards, and prevent the collapse of key bridges are, therefore, justified. If freight&#13;
and passenger tariffs are established to reflect economic costs, the payback period could be of about five&#13;
years and would recover the costs of the investments. This payback period would be well within the near&#13;
term expectations of no significant traffic growth.&#13;
2.7            Should all rail passenger traffic be stopped and emphasis given to freight? The emphasis&#13;
for the Railway should be to discontinue all services where full cost recovery is not possible, be it&#13;
passengers or freight. As a result of a review of costs and tariffs included under the institution building&#13;
component, the tariff increases necessary to recover costs will affect real demand for services, and&#13;
passenger traffic is expected to fall.&#13;
2.8           Is there a long termn role for the East-West rail?  The long term role of the Railway is&#13;
linked to the recovery of the Caucasian Region, increases in trade, in particular with the west, and an&#13;
improvement in the stability of the region. The uncertainties are such that the potential importance of&#13;
the Railway, significant as it may be, is not a sufficient reason to embark on full rehabilitation and&#13;
ambitious investments at this time.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
2.9            The Transport Rehabilitation Project, which will be the first transport sector investment&#13;
project in Georgia, will have the following objectives:&#13;
(a)    to support policy reform in the transport sector and restructure its institutions to&#13;
operate in a market economy; and&#13;
(b)    to repair and maintain some of the most critical elements of the transport system.&#13;
C. Project ComRonents and Descripfion&#13;
2.10          The project has two main components, each of them associated to one project objective.&#13;
They are presented in detail in para. 2.11 below. Their summary description is as follows:&#13;
(a)    Institution Building Component (US$ 4.9 million). It will include consultant&#13;
services for: (i) advice and support to teams preparing policy sector reforms; (ii)&#13;
technical assistance for the formulations of technical and legal frameworks&#13;
necessary to the restructuring, commercialization and privatization of sector&#13;
entities; (iii) managerial assistance for public and private transport enterprises;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                           II. The Project&#13;
(iv) a training program to update transport technical staff from the private and&#13;
public sectors; and (v) project management.&#13;
(b)    Investment Component (US$ 13.2 million). It will include financing for: (i) a&#13;
road maintenance program, including selected equipment and spares for road&#13;
maintenance, emergency repairs, and the necessary imported road building&#13;
materials; (ii) a railway sub-component, including bridge repairs and the&#13;
required structural steel, track materials (ties, rails and fastenings), spares for&#13;
locomotives, and communications and selected signalling equipment.&#13;
The component cost estimates above are without physical and price contingencies.&#13;
2.11          Institution Building Component. This project component will include the following:&#13;
(a)    Policy Reform (US$ 0.6 million): Provision of consulting services to modal agencies to&#13;
assist in (specific topics and cost estimates are shown in Annex 4): (i) revising legal&#13;
frameworks; (ii) advancing cost recovery policies; (iii) deregulating the sector ; and (iv)&#13;
privatization of road transport enterprises (see para. 1.28).&#13;
(b)    Support to the Transport Reform and Rehabilitation Center (US$ 0.9 million): Provision&#13;
of short term consultant services, equipment, and recurrent cost financing for the&#13;
Transport Reform and Rehabilitation Center (TRRC). Paras. 2.17 to 2.20 and Annex 5&#13;
present the functions of the TRRC.  These will include coordination of: project&#13;
preparation and implementation; procurement; policy fornulation; and sector reform.&#13;
In particular, the TRRC will be responsible for arranging training activities financed&#13;
under the project.&#13;
(c)    Consultant services to modal agencies and operational units, including:&#13;
For the Highway Concern (US$ 1.3 million):&#13;
e     to elaborate a revised road user charge system (see paras. 3.3 and 3.4) to address&#13;
existing financial issues and allow the start of road rehabilitation, as cost&#13;
recovery flows and recommendations of the Pavement Management Study&#13;
become available.&#13;
*     to improve road user charge collection performance and procedures.&#13;
*     to implement: (i) a program of privatization of road construction and maintenance&#13;
units -- submission of an implementation schedule of this program acceptable to&#13;
IDA, will be a condition of disbursement for civil works contracts (para. 5.3 (a))&#13;
-- see Annex 8 for the nature of contracts with these units; (ii) a program of&#13;
rentals, leasing and sale of road construction and maintenance equipment (see&#13;
Annex 9); and (iii) competitive bidding for all maintenance and rehabilitation&#13;
contracts. (Work on (ii) and (iii) has started under a PHRD grant.)&#13;
*     Pilot winter road maintenance techniques and equipment.&#13;
*     Carry out feasibility studies of road rehabilitation works already identified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. The Project                                                                           19&#13;
For the Railway Department (US$ 1.2 million):&#13;
0      Assistance to: (i) elaborate and implement a financial restructuring and&#13;
adjustment plan, including a program of cost and staff reductions and tariff&#13;
adjustments sufficient to recover costs (see Financial Analysis, chapter III); (ii)&#13;
assist management to execute a program of minimal renewal and rehabilitation;&#13;
(iii) organize seminars on modern railway management practices; and (iv) draft&#13;
legislation to change the railways status into that of an independent corporation.&#13;
For the Ports (US$ 0.9 million):&#13;
*     Assistance to: (i) elaboration of the regulatory framework necessary to the&#13;
commercialization/privatization of ports and related adjustments; and (ii) financial&#13;
restructuring focusing on cost and staff reductions and tariff increases to provide&#13;
the ports with some investment capacity of their own. This investment capacity&#13;
would be later used on carefully evaluated projects, in collaboration with private&#13;
partners.&#13;
2.12          Investment Component. The investment component of the project (US$ 13.2 million)&#13;
will include:&#13;
(a)    Road Maintenance Program (US$ 6.6 million): The assistance under the project will&#13;
consist of urgent road repairs (road clearing, drainage rehabilitation, surface dressing and&#13;
selected bridge rehabilitation on about 1,000 km of roads, costing an estimated US$ 5.3&#13;
million, and US$1.3 million worth of road maintenance equipment and spares), see&#13;
Annex 6 (cost estimates) and Annex 18 (economic evaluation).&#13;
(b)    Railway Sub-component (US$ 6.6 million): The sub-component will consist of urgent&#13;
investments to remove bottlenecks. The western part of the network requires stabilization&#13;
and protection of bridges, track repairs in critical sections, and traction capacity sufficient&#13;
for ten trains per day in both directions as a maximum, as well as basic communications&#13;
equipment and signalling to ensure a minimum of safety and reliability for humanitarian&#13;
aid and trade. For a detailed cost-estimate, see Annex 10. As the Railway does not have&#13;
any investment capacity of its own, these investments will be conditioned on the&#13;
generation of the ability to serve debt by a combination of cost reductions and tariff&#13;
increases (see Financial Analysis (Chapter III) and Annex 11). Assurances in this regard&#13;
have been included in the Government's letter of Sector Development Policy (see para.&#13;
3.15). Specification of an investment program acceptable to IDA and in such detail as&#13;
the Association shall reasonably request is a condition of disbursement for this sub-&#13;
component (see para. 5.3 (b)).&#13;
D. Cost Estimates and Financing&#13;
2.13          The estimated total cost of the project is US$20 million, net of taxes and duties, including&#13;
physical and price contingencies ($1.9 million). The foreign exchange component is US$11.1 million,&#13;
or about 56% of total project costs. Costs were estimated in US$ at July 1995 prices and include&#13;
physical contingencies of US$ 1 million, i.e. 5.5% of base costs, for materials, equipment and civil&#13;
works. Price contingencies amounting to US$0.9 million were estimated based on a constant 2.6% price&#13;
increase per year for foreign supplied goods and relative fluctuations in foreign exchange rates applicable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                                                        II. The Project&#13;
to the project. Estimated cost recovery flows (para. 3.2) are sufficient to cover unexpected increases in&#13;
local costs. The estimated cost of the project is given in detail in Annexes 6 and 10 and is summarized&#13;
in Table 11.1 below.&#13;

6.0 million to be applied as follows: (i) the EU will address technical assistance items under para. 2.11&#13;
(a)(i) and (c) -- Highway Concem; (ii) the Government of Germany has been asked to consider Technical&#13;
Assistance under para 2.11 (c) for the Railway department and Ports; (iii) USAID is considering a request&#13;
to finance the training elements of the project (Annex 14); and (v) the World Food Program is&#13;
considering extending its direct operational support to the Railways Department under 2.12 (b). Local&#13;
Funds will finance the remaining US$ 2.0 million which will be applied towards road repair contracts&#13;
under 2.12 (a).&#13;

E. Status of Cofinancing&#13;
2.16          Contributions to project finance by other donors and the private sector are still under&#13;
discussion. Tentative allocations still to be confirmed and subject to independent, parallel, appraisal and&#13;
disbursement procedures, are the following:&#13;
EU        Germany         USA          WFP    |   Total]&#13;
[   US$ million        1.00         2.50          1.00          1.50         6.00 ]&#13;
The effectiveness of project implementation and the development impact of IDA's contribution to&#13;
project finance would not be affected by unforeseen major delays in securing project cofinancing for&#13;
technical assistance. The impact of IDA's contribution to project financing for investments does not&#13;
depend on the availability of co-financing funds, since: (i) it would be applied to self contained, high&#13;
priority project components; (ii) the TA needed initially is already in place at the Highway Concern&#13;
(PHRD), the Railway (Germany) and project implementation (EU); and (iii) the repair capacity of the&#13;
agencies is adequate. All items indicated in para. 2.14 have been the subject of formal requests by&#13;
the Government of Georgia to the respective donors and are currently under consideration.&#13;
F. Implementation&#13;
2.17          Project implementation will be the overall responsibility of the Transport Reform and&#13;
Rehabilitation Center (TRRC - see para. 2. 11). This arrangement (see Annex 13 for details) has been&#13;
confirmed during negotiations. Each individual modal agency (the Highway Concern and the Railway&#13;
Department) will appoint a component manager and provide the necessary staff support, under the&#13;
supervision of the head of the agency and the overall coordination of the TRRC, to implement its sub-&#13;
component. The component manager will serve, in each agency, as the person responsible for assuring&#13;
that the component is implemented efficiently and on schedule. Additionally, each agency will be&#13;
responsible for sub-component accounting and will submit periodic implementation progress reports to&#13;
the TRRC. The TRRC will also coordinate the inputs of cofinancing partners and other Government&#13;
agencies, and will be responsible for assuring that implementation, including procurement, is in&#13;
compliance with Bank/IDA Guidelines and other agreements. The TRRC will also be responsible for&#13;
hiring auditors for all project audits, be the primary point of contact with IDA, and consolidate all project&#13;
reports and disbursement requests for their submission to IDA. IDA disbursements will be made directly&#13;
to contractors and suppliers of goods and services on the basis of this documentation or directly by TRRC&#13;
from the Special and Project Accounts.&#13;
2.18          Each component manager will be assisted by high quality staff recruited in part from the&#13;
ranks of each agency and augmented by consultants in case new skills are required. Each component&#13;
management team will be responsible for planning, budgeting, contracting and procurement of his&#13;
component. These functions will be carried in accordance to project implementation agreements between&#13;
the borrower and the implementing agencies the conclusion of which is a condition of credit effectiveness&#13;
(see para.5.2(a)). During the project, the component managers may utilize the services of the design&#13;
institutes as well as private engineering firms for the preparation of specifications and bidding documents&#13;
and for providing engineering supervision for the civil works sub-components of the project, provided&#13;
that they are technically competent and eligible to participate. Over time, the component management&#13;
teams could become the nucleus of revised and strengthened project management skills within the&#13;
agencies. As a minimum, each component manager will be assisted by a procurement and contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                                                                          II. The Project&#13;
specialist and an administrative assistant/accountant, in addition to support staff. See Annex 13 for&#13;
suggested organizational charts for each of the component management teams.&#13;
2.19          The TRRC will also be responsible for arranging training programs, will serve as a&#13;
channel for technical information available from outside of Georgia, and will coordinate foreign technical&#13;
assistance (see Annex 5 and Annex 19). The training programs will focus on environmental protection,&#13;
contracting, procurement, budgeting, and will address the most urgent needs of the evolving private&#13;
construction industry in the transport sector, including subjects such as: bidding, bid evaluation, cost and&#13;
quality control and general conditions of contract. On matters such as business administration, the&#13;
training will be broad-based, intended as means of familiarizing transport industry personnel with the&#13;
needs of private sector operations. This training will be provided by consultants through seminars and&#13;
training sessions held in Georgia. The need for further training will be identified and if possible&#13;
incorporated in the curricula of existing training institutions. See Annex 14 on a proposed training&#13;
coordination unit within the TRRC.&#13;
2.20          Staffing arrangements to assist the component manager for the road and rail&#13;
subcomponents and manage  technical assistance for ports and road transport privatization and&#13;
liberalization have been confirmed during negotiations.  The appointment of key staff to the TRRC&#13;
(deputy director, accountant, procurement specialist, transport operations), the Railway Department and&#13;
the Highway Concern ( for each a component manager, a project preparation officer, a contract manager&#13;
and a financial officer) is a condition of credit effectiveness (see para 5.2(b)). Technical assistance for&#13;
Ports will be managed by the TRRC.&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
2.21          The procurement arrangements under the project are included in Annex 15, while Table&#13;
11.3 below summarizes the project elements, their estimated costs and proposed methods of procurement.&#13;
Each project agency will use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents and procurement procedures in&#13;
accordance with the World Bank Procurement Guidelines, January 1995, and Consultant Guidelines,&#13;
August 1981. All IDA financed contractsfor this operation - goods and works - above US$ 100,000 will&#13;
be subject to Bank Prior Review. Prior review will also apply to consultantfirms contracts above US$&#13;
50,000, and above US$ 25,000 for individual consultants.&#13;
2.22          Bank standard bidding documents will be used for the Project. Procurement matters were&#13;
addressed in a Project Launch Workshop (October 9-14, 1995) and are included in the training program&#13;
financed under the project (see Annex 14). A General Procurement Notice will be published on&#13;
December 31, 1995. Procurement packages are being prepared, and those for goods and works will be&#13;
ready for review at the time of negotiations.&#13;
2.23          Contracts for civil works may be awarded by NCB, subject to an aggregate ceiling of US$&#13;
5 million, if they are under US$250,000 for small contracts; and between US$ 250,000 and under US$&#13;
450,000 for medium size contracts. All contracts greater than US$ 450,000 shall be subject to ICB.&#13;
In this project, contracts for road repair works will be small, dispersed, and of a diverse nature, not&#13;
suitable for grouping into bigger contracts for ICB, and may not interest foreign bidders. These contracts&#13;
will be awarded by NCB, and bids invited on the basis of locally advertised calls to tender. However,&#13;
qualified foreign contractors shall not be prevented from submitting bids. Regional Sample bidding&#13;
documents will be used for contracts below US$ 250,000, (issued September, 1995) and contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. The Project                                                                           23&#13;
between $250, 000 and $450,000 (issued August, 1995). The construction and maintenance units which&#13;
operated under the Highway Concern may participate in NCB, provided that they are found eligible under&#13;
Bank guidelines. These units have technical expertise to perform the work and some equipment of their&#13;
own, and are legally independent entities operating without any budgetary support. Equipment owned&#13;
by the Highway Concern may be made available under rental or leasing arrangements, on a first come&#13;
first served basis, with equal accessibility to any bidder who may indicate a need for them. Grouping&#13;
of contracts to allow for individual or combination bids will be done where possible.&#13;
2.24          Contracts under implementation support including office equipment and materials, and&#13;
vehicles, will be subject to the same arrangements as goods and equipment (see para. 2.25). The&#13;
remaining items including local administration costs such as salaries for project staff, utilities, and travel&#13;
and per diem, will be subject to Statements of Expenditure (SOE) (see para. 2.30), according to an annual&#13;
budget pre-approved by IDA, and are included in Table 11.3.&#13;
2.25          Contracts for goods and equipment (see Procurement Arrangements, Annex 15) may be&#13;
awarded according to the following thresholds: (i) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for contracts&#13;
valued above US$ 200,000; (ii) International Shopping (IS) for contracts valued between US$200,000 and&#13;
US$ 30,000, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$ 1 million; and (iii) National Shopping (NS)&#13;
for contracts valued below US$ 30,000, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$ 650,000. In cases&#13;
(ii) and (iii) the list of suppliers invited to bid will be agreed upon by IDA. Single source procurement&#13;
is not anticipated. Under ICB contracting for goods, a margin of preference of 15% will apply to&#13;
domestic bidders in accordance with paras. 2.54 and 2.55 of the Bank Guidelines.&#13;
2.26          Consultant services and technical assistance under the project (see para. 2.11 and&#13;
Procurement Arrangements, Annex 15) which are financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with&#13;
IDA guidelines. Subject to prior review ceilings (para. 2.21), and SOE thresholds (para.2.30), it is&#13;
anticipated that contracts for consultant services, including technical assistance, financed by IDA will be&#13;
for consulting firms on the basis of short listing, and their selection and terms of reference will be&#13;
subject to prior review by IDA. In the event that contracting of individual consultants takes place under&#13;
items 3.1 and 3.2 in Table 11.3, these contracts shall not exceed an aggregate amount of $ 200,000, and&#13;
their selection and terms of reference will be subject to prior review.&#13;
2.27          Civil works, railway spare parts, supplies, and consulting services financed under parallel&#13;
financing agreements by other donors, will be procured under the procurement rules of those donors.&#13;
2.28          The executing agencies will collect and record procurement information and will include&#13;
it in quarterly progress reports to the TRRC, which will be responsible for the submission of such reports&#13;
to IDA, indicating: revised cost estimates of physical and price contingency allowances and physical&#13;
execution and payments made; and revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding,&#13;
contract award, and completion times for individual contracts. The borrower will provide a completion&#13;
report within six months of the credit's closing date (see paras. 2.36 and 5.1 (a)).&#13;
2.29          Contracts under implementation support including office equipment and materials, and&#13;
vehicles, will be subject to the same arrangements as goods and equipment (see para. 2.25). The&#13;
remaining items including local administration costs such as salaries for project staff, utilities, and travel&#13;
and per diem, will be subject to Statements of Expenditure (SOE) (see para. 2.30), according to an annual&#13;
budget pre-approved by IDA, and are included in Table 11.3.&#13;

2.31          Consultant services and technical assistance under the project (see para. 2.11 and&#13;
Procurement Arrangements, Annex 15) which are financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with&#13;
IDA guidelines. Subject to prior review ceilings (para. 2.21), and SOE thresholds (para.2.30), it is&#13;
anticipated that contracts for consultant services, including technical assistance, financed by IDA will be&#13;
for consulting firms on the basis of short listing, and their selection and terms of reference will be&#13;
subject to prior review by IDA. In the event that contracting of individual consultants takes place under&#13;
items 3.1 and 3.2 in Table 11.3, these contracts shall not exceed an aggregate amount of $ 200,000, and&#13;
their selection and terms of reference will be subject to prior review.&#13;
2.32          Civil works, railway spare parts, supplies, and consulting services financed under parallel&#13;
financing agreements by other donors, will be procured under the procurement rules of those donors.&#13;
2.33          The executing agencies will collect and record procurement information and will include&#13;
it in quarterly progress reports to the TRRC, which will be responsible for the submission of such reports&#13;
to IDA, indicating: revised cost estimates of physical and price contingency allowances and physical&#13;
execution and payments made; and revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding,&#13;
contract award, and completion times for individual contracts. The borrower will provide a completion&#13;
report within six months of the credit's closing date (see paras. 2.36 and 5.1 (a)).&#13;
H. Disbursements&#13;
2.34          The Credit will finance procurement of spare parts, goods, emergency repairs and&#13;
technical assistance. Because of their nature, disbursements are expected to be completed in about 30&#13;
months. The expected closing date is June 1999. An estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in&#13;
Annex 3. To ensure prompt availability of credit funds, the Government will establish a Special Account&#13;
in a comrmercial bank at terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, to cover IDA's share of eligible&#13;
expenditures (Table 11.4 below). The Authorized Allocation would be US$ 500,000 -- approximately four&#13;
months of average expenditures made through the Special Account. During the early stages of the&#13;
project, the initial allocation to the special account will be limited to US$ 250,000. However, once the&#13;
aggregated disbursements under the credit have reached the level of US$ 3,000,000 , the initial allocation&#13;
may be increased up to Authorized Allocation of US$ 500,000 by submitting the relevant application for&#13;
withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of the special account would be submitted monthly or when&#13;
one third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for&#13;
replenishment will follow the standard Bank procedure as described in the Disbursement Handbook,&#13;
Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the special account which have been reconciled by the Borrower,&#13;
will accompany all replenishment requests.&#13;
2.35          All disbursements under the project will be made against standard documentation except&#13;
for contracts valued at less than US$100,000 equivalent, which may be claimed under Statement of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs) -- with related documentation retained by the project agencies for review by IDA&#13;
supervision and project audit missions. The minimum size of an application for direct disbursement from&#13;

the Credit Account will be 20% of the current Authorized Allocation to the Special Account. In addition,&#13;
the Government will establish a Project Account for counterpart funds in a commercial Bank with an&#13;
initial allocation equal to 10% of the estimated local funds contribution to the project. The opening of&#13;
the Project Account is a condition of credit effectiveness (see para. 5.2 (c)).&#13;
2.36         The estimated schedule of disbursements (Annex 3) is based on the project implementation&#13;
schedule (Annex 2). Delays in implementation are less likely to occur given the emergency nature of the&#13;
project. Table II.4 below shows the estimated IDA disbursements and the percentage of eligible&#13;
expenditures financed. In the case of goods, the eligible expenditures and percentages of financing will&#13;
be: 100% of foreign expenditures, and 100% of local expenditures (ex factory cost). For all other items&#13;
procured locally, the eligible expenditure is the price amount net of VAT or 80% of the invoice amount.&#13;

I. Monitoring. Reporting. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
2.37         The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all other project-related&#13;
accounts will be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. Annual financial&#13;
statements of IDA-financed components and of project implementing agencies will be prepared and&#13;
audited in accordance with International Auditing Guidelines by suitably qualified independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA and submitted to IDA within six months of the close of the project agencies' financial&#13;
year.&#13;
2.38         Audits of SOEs, against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made out&#13;
of the credit proceeds, will also be carried out in accordance with IDA guidelines. Specific reference will&#13;
be made in the audit reports accompanying the financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11. The Proiect                                                                           27&#13;
2.38          Audits of SOEs, against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made out&#13;
of the credit proceeds, will also be carried out in accordance with IDA guidelines. Specific reference will&#13;
be made in the audit reports accompanying the financial statements.&#13;
2.39          Auditors acceptable to IDA will be retained by the project agencies to: (i) review the&#13;
accounting systems and supporting internal procedures and practices for the special and project accounts&#13;
and SOEs; and (ii) recommend any needed changes that would be implemented not later than 3 months&#13;
after the issuance and acceptance of the auditors report by IDA.&#13;
2.40          During negotiations, it was agreed that by June 30 each year, the TRRC will submit to&#13;
IDA the auditor's report and audited financial statements for the Special Account, Project Accounts and&#13;
SOEs for the preceding calendar year.&#13;
2.41          Quarterly progress reports, including monitoring of progress on project targets and&#13;
performance indicators (see Annex 2, page 3) and covering all project components, will be prepared by&#13;
TRRC and sent to IDA within one month after the end of each quarter. These reports will also include:&#13;
(i) progress achieved against agreed implementation and disbursement schedules, and number of contracts&#13;
awarded; (ii) work programs and cost estimates for the coming quarter and for the total project; and (iii)&#13;
financial indicators outlined in paras. 3.8 and 3.15. The main purpose of the reports will be to provide&#13;
the project agencies timely and updated information on implementation of project components,&#13;
highlighting issues and problem areas, recommending actions follow up on previous recommendations&#13;
(see para. 5.1 (a)).&#13;
2.42          The project agencies will also prepare, under the coordination of the TRRC, an&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) in accordance with IDA guidelines and submit it to IDA&#13;
promptly after completion of the project but in any event not later than six months after the credit closing&#13;
date. During negotiations, agreement has been reached on the preparation of progress reports (see para&#13;
5.1 (a)), including a Mid-term Implementation Report to be submitted to IDA on June 30, 1997, and the&#13;
ICR.&#13;
J. Onlendini Terms&#13;
2.43          The beneficiary of the credit will be the Republic of Georgia. Funds on-lent to modal&#13;
agencies will have the following terms: the principal amount to be denominated in US$ equivalent as of&#13;
the withdrawal date, no more than one year grace, plus no more than a 5 year repayment period, at a&#13;
fixed rate equal to 7.07 %, and repayments in local currency, determined as of the date or respective dates&#13;
of repayment (see para. 5.1 (c)).&#13;
K. Project Supervision&#13;
2.44          Three Bank supervision missions each year, each staffed by a senior engineer and such&#13;
specialists as may be appropriate for each phase of the project (such as procurement expert, training&#13;
expert, traffic safety specialist or financial analyst) will be required over the life of the project, each of&#13;
about one to two weeks duration, for a total of 96 staff weeks, including time at head quarters. Missions&#13;
will assist in project start-up, will review physical progress, and will assist in coordinating the cofinanced&#13;
elements of the project. Cofinanciers will be invited to attend all supervision missions. The project&#13;
implementation schedule and monitorable performance indicators are given in Annex 2, and a schedule&#13;
of supervision missions is included as Annex 16. A Mid-Term Review will be held not later than July&#13;
15, 1997, to assess the effectiveness of project implementation arrangements and reallocate funds between&#13;
project categories if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                            II. The Project&#13;
L. Environmental Asaects&#13;
2.45          The project will have a positive impact on safety, with potential saving of human lives&#13;
which would otherwise be lost due to road and rail accidents. The different components included in the&#13;
project are not expected to generate any significant environmental problems since all work will be done&#13;
on existing infrastructure, utilizing as much as possible existing equipment. In the case of the Railway,&#13;
for example, the repair of bridges, repacking of ballast, and replacement of track to be included under&#13;
the project will be confined to the existing right-of-way. In the case of the road maintenance sub-&#13;
component, however, some environmental concerns may arise from: (i) the production and application&#13;
of bituminous products; (ii) the quarrying of aggregates; (iii) noise, dust and disruption of traffic during&#13;
the rehabilitation and maintenance work. Since these environmental risks are limited, this project has&#13;
been designated as Category B, indicating that a full Environmental Assessment (EA) is not required.&#13;
In compliance with OD 4.01 however, a brief environmental analysis has been prepared and a summary&#13;
of it is included as Annex 17.&#13;
2.46          Included in this analysis is a mitigation plan (Annex 17 Table 1) addressing the five areas&#13;
of concern mentioned in para. 2.40, and ensuring the minimization of the limited environmental risks&#13;
under the project. Important elements under the plan include: (a) the initiation of emission testing to&#13;
determine actual rather than projected levels of pollution emitted as a result of the resumption of&#13;
production at asphalt plants (2.40 (i)); (b) a review of procedures and formats for the environmental&#13;
reports and licenses for asphalt plants, landfills, and the quarrying of gravels (2.40 (i,ii)); (c) training in&#13;
environment aspects of construction management and road maintenance including asphalt application and&#13;
disposal of wastes (2.40 (i,iii,iv)); and (d) contractual guarantees and monitoring to assure compliance&#13;
by contractors with environmentally sound and safe standards for the performance of civil works (2.40&#13;
(ii,iii,iv)). Additionally, a portion of civil works under the project, will address the need for improved&#13;
drainage to avoid the risk of localized instances of erosion (para. 2.40 (v)).&#13;
2.47          The mitigation plan is expected to be in place no later than March 15, 1996. The&#13;
Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEP) has been recently empowered with reinforced and&#13;
consolidated responsibilities to make policy and promulgate standards relevant to environmental&#13;
protection. The MoEP is in the process of preparing a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) as&#13;
required by IDA for all IDA-recipient countries as well as reviewing a variety of policies and regulatory&#13;
standards. In addition, the MoEP has been empowered to overhaul the current licensing system for such&#13;
facilities as asphalt plants and gravel quarries. Priority will be given to reviewing the licenses currently&#13;
held by the State Concern of Highways. The MoEP will also establish a special task force to assist with&#13;
environmental monitoring relative to the mitigation plan of this project. Thus, the minimal chance of risk&#13;
and the above discussed safeguards would make the project environmentally sound. Agreement has been&#13;
reached during negotiations on the implementation of all measures required by the project's environmental&#13;
mitigation plan no later than March 15, 1996, and included as a side letter to the Credit Agreement (see&#13;
para. 5.1 (d)).&#13;
M. Program Objective Categories&#13;
2.48          The project will contribute directly to sustainable development of Georgia by preserving&#13;
key transport infrastructure. It will also make a significant contribution to the development of the private&#13;
sector in the country through the competitive bidding of public works contracts and privatization of the&#13;
road construction and maintenance industry, the introduction of licensing of port and railway operators,&#13;
and the divestiture of some non-transport activities currently under the ownership of transport entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. The Project                                                                                  29&#13;
Submission of a privatization schedule acceptable to IDA is a condition of disbursement for civil works&#13;
contracts (see para. 5.3(a)). The project will also assist small farmers and tradesmen in their efforts to&#13;
begin to develop private business ventures by assuring that they have improved access to markets for their&#13;
products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Highway Concern&#13;
3.1          Current Financial Situation. In recent years, the state could not fulfill its statutory&#13;
obligation to fund the Highway Concern. In 1995, only proceeds from a "Road Tax" on enterprises&#13;
estimated at about $150,000 were available. The cost recovery issue was recently addressed by the&#13;
Government in the context of its program of reforms, and in September 2, 1995 the Georgian Parliament&#13;
approved legislation establishing a cost recovery system based on specific road user charges, aiming at&#13;
generating revenues for road construction, maintenance and rehabilitation.&#13;
3.2           This cost recovery system, which will be referred to as the "initial road user charge&#13;
system" in the following paragraphs, includes:&#13;
*     A fuel tax of 5% on value-added of diesel, gasoline and lubricants;&#13;
*     A border crossing tax on vehicles registered abroad entering Georgia (this tax averages&#13;
$20 for cars, $80 for buses and $160 for trucks); and&#13;
*     A yearly domestic vehicle registration tax of $0.2 for cars, $1 for buses and $1.5 for&#13;
trucks.&#13;
This cost recovery system also keeps the previous so called "Road Tax" (1 % on most enterprises' gross&#13;
revenues). All proceeds would be directed into a Road Fund, directly managed by the Highway Concern.&#13;
In addition, State budget allocations to the Highway Concern would be eliminated.&#13;
3.3          Issues on the Initial Road User Charge System. Although acceptable as a first step,&#13;
and expected to yield sufficient resources to start addressing the road maintenance backlog, the initial road&#13;
user charge system introduces some distortions to the "road-user = road-payer" principle:&#13;
3     Border crossing taxes are too high (they alone would generate about 45 % of all revenues&#13;
under the current system), making foreign vehicles pay an unreasonably high share of&#13;
road maintenance costs in Georgia. Road user charges within Georgian borders need to&#13;
be indistinguishable with regard to ownership or provenance, and each vehicle, local and&#13;
foreign, should be taxed according to the damage it produces to the roads (i.e., according&#13;
to its axle load).&#13;
*     Fuel and lubricants taxes, on the other hand, appear to be too low. Fuel and lubricants&#13;
would only be taxed on the value-added portion of the retail price, thus only generating&#13;
less than 1 % of total road user charge revenues.&#13;
*     The "Road Tax" on enterprise gross revenue also generates distortions since it does not&#13;
tax enterprises according to their use of roads.&#13;
3.4          The Revised Road User Charge System. The need for revising road user charges to&#13;
remove distortions and discriminatory practices was agreed during negotiations, including: (i) the need&#13;
for the execution no later than October 31, 1996 of a study to determine a pavement management system&#13;
and refine levels of cost recovery; and (ii) the Government's approval and implementation, after&#13;
consultation with IDA no later than January 31, 1997, of a revised road user charge system as shall be&#13;
appropriate for the maintenance and keeping up of its primary road network no later than June 30, 1997&#13;
(see para. 5.1(e)). The revised system would yield resources which would become directly available to&#13;
the Highway Concern and would include revenue sources such as:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. Financial Analysis                                                                   31&#13;
*      A fuel surtax of 10% on the full price of diesel, gasoline and lubricants;&#13;
*      A charge on vehicles registered abroad entering Georgia (this tax would be defined on&#13;
an axle-load basis, and would amount to $2.5/ton of axle load); and&#13;
*      A yearly domestic vehicle registration tax, also based on axle-loads, of $7/ton of axle&#13;
load.&#13;
The "Road Tax" on enterprise income would be eliminated. All road maintenance and rehabilitation&#13;
works would be exclusively financed by proceeds from the revised road user charge system. The&#13;
parameters of the revised system will correspond to the actual road damage from each type of traffic, and&#13;
would be subject to adjustment on the basis of a Pavement Management Study to be carried out under&#13;
the project (see para. 5.1 (e)).&#13;
3.5           In addition, collection procedures would need to be put in place to ensure proper&#13;
collection performance and that all the proceeds from this user charge system are exclusively used by the&#13;
Highway Concern for road maintenance and rehabilitation (see para. 3.8).&#13;
3.6           The charges on the entry of foreign vehicles is subject to reciprocal measures in&#13;
neighboring countries. This is less than ideal, since it raises the costs to trade, and in the case of&#13;
Georgia, might divert traffic away as alternative routes become available. Such discriminatory practices&#13;
would need to be discontinued under the revised road user charge system .&#13;
3.7           Future Financial Performance. Total resources generated, on the basis of the present&#13;
level of road traffic and once collection is well established under the initial road user charge system, will&#13;
reach US$30 million per year. Cashflow projections for the Highway Concern are presented in summary&#13;
form in Table Ill.1, and in their entirety, including a detailed list of notes and assumptions used, in&#13;
Annex 7. The projections include a US$5 million borrowing from the proposed IDA Credit to make the&#13;
most urgent repairs to start the process. A significant road rehabilitation program averaging about $20&#13;
million per year could be put in place. This is subject to the successful implementation of collection and&#13;
enforcement procedures.&#13;
3.8           Key monitorable actions factored in the projections will be discussed during negotiations,&#13;
and are the following:&#13;
-     Tax Collection Performance: The projections assume that road user charge proceeds&#13;
would start to be collected no later than March 15, 1996. On the basis of systematic&#13;
enforcement, collection performance for the border crossing tax is expected to improve&#13;
from 20% of potential revenues in 1996, to 60% by year 2000, and from 20% to 70%&#13;
for the vehicle registration tax. Collection performance for the fuel tax is assumed to&#13;
improve over time, to reach full collection by the year 2000. Assurances in this regard,&#13;
and on enforcement of national environmental and fuel quality standards, will be sought&#13;
during negotiations (see para. 5. 1 (f)).&#13;
*      Highwav Concern Staff: Highway Concern staff levels would be brought down to 1,000&#13;
employees by 1999; this matches Highway Concern officials estimates. The 5,500 staff&#13;
estimated to work in maintenance and construction units would become private sector&#13;
employees as these units become private. About 1,500 of the remaining 2,500 employees&#13;
would be laid-off by 1998 in a staff reduction program. Full operation of a national&#13;
competitive bidding process is expected to take place in 1997 as the construction and&#13;
maintenance units undergo privatization (see para. 5.3 (a)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                                                    III. Financial Analysis&#13;
0      Severance. Salaries and Wages: Staff reduction would be compensated by severance&#13;
payments of up to 2 years of salary, a total of US$ 720,000 over three years. At the&#13;
same time, in order to retain qualified human resources, average salaries would be&#13;
initially increased from current US$4.7 per month to about US$20 per month.&#13;
*     Divestiture of Assets:  The privatization of maintenance and construction units, as&#13;
proposed in the road sub-component of the project, could generate up to an estimated&#13;
US$1 million in sales of assets, mostly real estate and equipment. Alternatively, these&#13;
assets could be leased out. In any case the resulting revenues would be used by the&#13;
Highway Concern as additional resources for road rehabilitation.&#13;

B. Railway Denartment&#13;
3.9            Current Financial Situation. The accounts of the Railway Department are on accrual&#13;
basis4 and show a poor cashflow situation, although substantial "profits" are indicated for 1994 (about&#13;
US$ 11 million). These "profits" are explained by an underestimated asset value (today, assets are valued&#13;
at about US$ 13 million, i.e., less than the purchase price of 10 locomotives), and very low allocations&#13;
to depreciation. This situation makes the Railway pay more profit taxes than it should if assets were&#13;
revalued and depreciation charges applied. The Railway is decapitalizing at a fast pace, and even if all&#13;
"profits" were allocated to the rehabilitation of the asset base, the erosion of the capital base would not&#13;
be stopped.&#13;
3.10           Most of the revenues of the Railway come from freight operations (most of which is food&#13;
aid transport), where the average tariff was of about USCents 2.2 per ton.km in 1994. Passenger&#13;
transport, where the average tariff was of only USCents 0.03 per passenger.km in 1994, is far from&#13;
covering its costs.&#13;
3.11           Despite its "profit", the Railway has difficulties in paying its bills. Payables, mainly to&#13;
Sakenergo, the power supplier, amounted to about US$ 11 million at the end of 1994, or about 16 months&#13;
of total expenses. This situation partly results from the fact that the Railway's accounts are considered,&#13;
de facto, as treasury accounts by the Government, and do not belong to a truly independent commercial&#13;
enterprise.&#13;
3.12           Adding to these difficulties, current legislation in Georgia requires all companies,&#13;
including the Railway Department, to sell 32 % of all hard-currency revenues to the National Bank. The&#13;
railway has therefore limited capacity to import rolling stock, spares and track maintenance materials.&#13;
Hard currency can be bought back from the National Bank, provided that an importing license has been&#13;
requested and obtained.&#13;
3.13           Today, the Railway is not able to invest its surpluses. Unless significant efforts to move&#13;
towards financial adjustment and restructuring are undertaken with urgency (see para. 3.15), no funds&#13;
would be available for the necessary rehabilitation of the railway system.&#13;
3.14           Future Financial Performance. Given the current financial situation, the proposed credit&#13;
for the Railway sub-component would require the generation of an ability to service debt. This can be&#13;
achieved by starting the implementation of a financial adjustment and restructuring plan (see below),&#13;
including a combination of cost reductions and tariff increases. Financial projections5, based on the&#13;
assumption that the proposed financial adjustment restructuring plan is effectively put in place, and&#13;
including about US$6.6 million in borrowing, some of which in concessional terms, are presented in a&#13;
summary form in Tables 111.2 and 111.3 below, and in their entirety, including a list of notes and&#13;
assumptions used, in Annex 11.&#13;
4/     i.e., revenues and expenditures are reported at the time of billing, as opposed to cash-basis accounts, where revenues&#13;
and expenditures are reported at the time of payment.&#13;
5/     Financial projections were prepared in US$. Company accounts have been restated to approximate International&#13;
Accounting Standards (IAS) and have been converted from Georgian coupons into US$ for easier comparability.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                                        III. Financial Analysis&#13;
3.15          The need for a financial adjustment and restructuring plan has been recognized in the&#13;
Letter of Sector Development Policy which was signed during negotiations. It will require the&#13;
establishment of the railways as an independent commercially operated, state owned enterprise, with&#13;
improved operating and financial practices to avoid further decapitalization of the Railway Enterprise,&#13;
and allowing rail operations by other private operators. The specific areas to be addressed include: (i)&#13;
asset revaluation; (ii) tariff adjustment; (iii) staff reduction and salary increases; and (iv) a cost-reduction&#13;
program. The necessary technical assistance will be made available under the Institution Building&#13;
Component.&#13;
(i)    Asset revaluation: A recent Government decree, to be implemented on October 1, 1995,&#13;
will revalue assets 12.7 times, from current US$ 13 million equivalent to about US$ 171&#13;
million to account for distortions from past inflation.  This revaluation factor was&#13;
calculated by the Ministry of Finance for all enterprises in Georgia to account for&#13;
inflation. The asset revaluation factored in the projections is in line with the decree; full&#13;
depreciation of these assets was estimated to take place over 11 years, their average&#13;
useful life remaining. A detailed railway-specific asset revaluation, however, made by&#13;
qualified auditors is needed, taking into account all assets in working condition. All other&#13;
assets would be written off the accounts, and eventually used as a source of spare parts.&#13;
The average remaining life of the revalued assets, along with the corresponding average&#13;
depreciation rate, would then be assessed and revised as necessary.&#13;
(ii)    Tariff Adjustment: In order to reflect the costs of the services provided and to generate&#13;
enough funds to cover the necessary rehabilitation investments, average passenger&#13;
transport tariffs would need to be sharply increased from current USCents 0.05/pass.nkm&#13;
to an estimated USCents 3.00/pass.km by the year 2000, and average freight tariffs from&#13;
USCents 3.07/ton.km to about USCents 4.00/ton.km by 1998. The Railway would have&#13;
to discontinue all services where cost recovery is not possible, be it passengers or freight.&#13;
In other words, lines may remain open, and given transport services can remain part of&#13;
the Railway's operations, only if revenues from these services cover all the costs involved&#13;
in providing them.&#13;
(iii)   Staff reduction and salary increase: Today, the Railway Department employs about&#13;
18,200 people in transport operations. Of these, about 6,600 are not paid ("technical&#13;
unemployment").  The current number of employees would need to be reduced,&#13;
according to current traffic levels and given the size of the railway network, to about&#13;
10,000 as a first step. Staff reduction would be compensated by severance payments of&#13;
2 years of salary. These payments of about US$ 4 million over four years, are financially&#13;
feasible, and have been factored in the financial projections (see Annex 11). This would&#13;
give employees incentives to consider leaving the entity, and would increase the number&#13;
of voluntary departures. At the same time, in order to retain qualified human resources,&#13;
salaries would be initially increased 3 times to about US$20/month.&#13;
(iv)    Cost-reduction program: This program would include divestiture of all non-transport&#13;
related activities, returning to the state public services and selling (e.g., auctioning)&#13;
assets, and enable private companies to operate activities which may or may not be&#13;
directly linked with railway operations.&#13;
These steps would be discussed during negotiations, and made part of the project implementation plan.&#13;

IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Proiect Benefits and Costs&#13;
4.1           Benefits - Institution Building Component. This component will support the program&#13;
of reforms under preparation by the Government of Georgia, by accelerating the development of the&#13;
policy framework in the transport sector. The reforms will result in lower costs and better transport&#13;
services and are summarized in a Letter of Sector Development Policy signed by the Government.&#13;
Although the Institution Building component, which accounts for about 25 % of total project costs, does&#13;
not lend itself to conventional economic rate of return analysis, it will help to: (i) consolidate a new and&#13;
downsized role for the State in transport; (ii) create an enabling environment for the development of&#13;
competitive transport markets; (iii) introduce fiscal discipline in the sector; and (iv) privatize and divest&#13;
from state owned transport entities. All these actions tend to increase entrepreneurs' perception of&#13;
fairness, openmess and freedom from intervention, and will make Georgia a more attractive investment&#13;
choice for potential investors. For the purpose of the economic evaluation, technical assistance to the&#13;
Highway Concern and the Railway Department has been included in the total costs of the respective&#13;
investments.&#13;
4.2           Benefits - Investment Component. This component, by maintaining and rehabilitating&#13;
key transport infrastructure, will remove a real risk of facing critical bottlenecks in the transport system.&#13;
In the short term, it will ensure that the basic transport infrastructure remains available to transport&#13;
humanitarian assistance to Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and that trade activities which are&#13;
developing in other economic sectors can actually take place. More specifically, ror each of the&#13;
ir-estment sub-components:&#13;
(a) Road Maintenance Program: This sub-component, representing about 40% of total&#13;
project costs (inclusive of technical assistance), will greatly increase the capacity of the&#13;
Highway Concern to carry out key maintenance and rehabilitation of the public road&#13;
network in Georgia, by introducing an equitable road user charges system. It will&#13;
prolong the life of the highway system and delay and/or avoid costly reconstruction. The&#13;
program will also reduce vehicle operating costs and maintenance as well as road accident&#13;
risks. An additional sub-component benefit will be the experience that would be gained&#13;
by the private construction industry in carrying out road maintenance work on a&#13;
competitive basis. The economic evaluation has been performed separately for the&#13;
primary and secondary roads included in the project, a traffic growth of less than 2 % per&#13;
year has been used, and the same traffic applies to both the without the project and with&#13;
the project alternatives, i.e. there is no expectation of generated traffic in this case. The&#13;
main economic benefit quantified is vehicle operating cost savings. The economic life&#13;
of the repairs is three years for the main roads and five years for secondary roads, and&#13;
no reconstruction expected in the intervening years in the without the project case. The&#13;
Economic Rate of Return for this sub-component is expected to be in excess of 46% (see&#13;
Annex 18 Table I).&#13;
(b) Railway Sub-Component: This sub-component (about 46% of total project costs,&#13;
inclusive of technical assistance) has been evaluated on the basis of: (i) reduced rail&#13;
operating costs, and (ii) generated freight traffic benefits resulting from increased levels&#13;
of service resulting from the project, and (iii) reduced passenger traffic after tariff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV.  Project Benefits and Risks                                                             37&#13;
adjustments. There are other benefits of the project which were not quantified, such as&#13;
the removal of potential bottlenecks which, if left untouched, would lead to the complete&#13;
stoppage of railway transport to and from the Black Sea ports. This would be critical for&#13;
the transport of food-aid and capital goods to Georgia and neighboring countries. In&#13;
addition, the railway sub-component will also enhance cost-effectiveness and management&#13;
skills for future railway operations in a market-oriented economy, and will improve&#13;
safety on the railway system by rehabilitating bridges, track, and some selected&#13;
telecommunications and signalization elements. The economic life of the investments has&#13;
been estimated at seven years.  The Economic Rate of Return for this sub-component&#13;
is expected to be about 29% (see Annex 18 Table II).&#13;
4.3           Project Costs. The estimation of project costs in an economy in transition such as&#13;
Georgia poses some difficulties which come in part from remaining price distortions, less than perfect&#13;
market operations and incomplete information on the level of economic activity. The effects of these&#13;
difficulties have been reduced by means of: (i) a systematic use of US dollar based estimates at a time&#13;
of improved fiscal management and exchange rate stability, and (ii) use of unit costs for project cost&#13;
estimates following the experience in other countries in the region. As a result, adjustments in key&#13;
parameters such as the wage rate, which are likely to occur over the next few years, are not expected to&#13;
have an extreme impact on actual project costs to be observed during project implementation.&#13;
4.4           Sensitivity Analysis.  The weighted Economic Rate of Return for the Investment&#13;
Component (inclusive of technical assistance, and excluding taxes and contingencies), representing 86%&#13;
of project costs, will be in excess of 36%, with a Net Present Value discounted at 10% of US$ 12&#13;
million. A sensitivity analysis has been performed (see Annex 18, Table III) for: (a) traffic varations of&#13;
+ 5%, reflecting the awareness that a sharper contraction or sudden increases in economic activity are&#13;
not likely in the near future in Georgia; (b) Changes of + 20% in project costs, which could result from&#13;
the fact that this is a first project in the sector in Georgia and there is no prior experience with&#13;
competitive bidding systems; and (c) Changes in operating costs of + 20% resulting from imperfect&#13;
knowledge of operating costs parameters such as the economic wage rate, equipment and maintenance&#13;
real costs and the valuation of foreign exchange. The results indicate a robust project with a significant&#13;
return on investments under likely scenarios, as follows: (i) a slight sensitivity to traffic levels, a&#13;
reduction of about 2% in the ERR would result from traffic levels 5% lower than estimated; (ii) a&#13;
damped sensitivity to project costs, a 20% increase in project costs would have a proportionally smaller&#13;
impact on the ERR, which would decrease by about 17%; and (iii) the variations in the ERR due to&#13;
changes in operatring costs estimates, are similar in magnitude and opposite in sign to the effects of&#13;
project cost changes, and will tend to offset each other.&#13;
4.5           Project Sustainability. The ERR of the project in excess of 36% on 86% of project&#13;
costs is far greater than could be achieved by any other measures to improve transport infrastructure to&#13;
a comparable extent. This results from the selection of priority sections using economic criteria as well&#13;
as the rehabilitation nature of the project, with emphasis on infrastructure maintenance, and equipment&#13;
repairs. The sustainability of the project will be assured by: (i) the implementation of cost recovery&#13;
measures (road user charges and adjustment of railway tariffs); (ii) restructuring of State owned&#13;
enterprises on a commercial basis, including divestiture of non transport and non performing assets; and&#13;
(iii) privatization and liberalization of road transport and road and construction industries. A financial&#13;
analysis from a Government as well as an agency perspective, has shown that subject to the&#13;
implementation of the measures proposed, the project would be sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                                            IV. Project Benefits and Risks&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
4.6          In light of the results of the sensitivity analysis, remaining project risks mainly relate to&#13;
the ability of the Govermment of Georgia, after setting-up the Transport Reform and Rehabilitation&#13;
Center, to create the framework for the project agencies (the Highway Concern and the Railway&#13;
Department) to establish effective implementation units capable of carrying out project activities and&#13;
perform contracting and procurement effectively.&#13;
4.7          Institution Building and Policy Reforms. The risks of this component relate to the&#13;
degree of commitment of the Government and of project agencies to continue the chosen program of&#13;
sector reforms. Although the government has taken a series of decisive and courageous measures over&#13;
the last few months, and there is a growing number of top government officials committed to reform,&#13;
there is not yet unanimous support for all the aspects of the reform program. For example, such matters&#13;
as the implementation of equitable road user charges and collection procedures are likely to challenge the&#13;
local capacity to effect change.&#13;
4.8           Road Maintenance. Risks in this sub-component include: (i) the ability of the Highway&#13;
Concern to put in place a contracting system for road rehabilitation and maintenance works; (ii)&#13;
availability of a steady flow of resources necessary to implement the program; and (iii) the lack of&#13;
experience of newly privatized construction companies. Risks (i) and (iii) which are more irprortant for&#13;
the future will be mitigated by technical assistance being provided under the project. Regarding (ii), a&#13;
condition of Board presentation, fulfilled on September 2, 1995, was the enactment of legislation to&#13;
introduce a road user charge system, which will provide the necessary funds even under gradual&#13;
enforcement and compliance schedules.&#13;
4.9           Railway Rehabilitation. The risks relate to the capacity and commitment of the Railway&#13;
Department to undertake a major restructuring, including in particular divestiture of non-transport related&#13;
activities, a staff reduction program and significant tariff increases. Even though these aspects are&#13;
included in the Letter of Sector Development Policy, and technical assistance would be made available&#13;
under the project, the long-term commitment of the Railway Department to reform is still to be&#13;
determined. This aspect has been addressed by the inclusion of a disbursement condition on all railway&#13;
investments which are subject to the submittal to IDA of an acceptable railway investment plan and&#13;
related financial statements (see para. 5.3 (b)).&#13;
4.10          Other Risks. Another risk of the proposed project is delayed implementation due to&#13;
inadequate capacity within the Govermnent and the project agencies. Given the state of disrepair of the&#13;
transport network, a timely implementation and rapid materialization of benefits from the proposed&#13;
Transport Rehabilitation Credit are essential to its success, To reduce that risk, continuous effort has&#13;
been provided by the Bank during project preparation by setting up training and working sessions by&#13;
procurement specialists through a PHRD grant, by additional training financed under the Credit, and&#13;
through the mobilization of further external technical assistance.&#13;
4.11          Finally, there is a risk that civil strife in Georgia might resurface. Negotiations are taking&#13;
place in search of a lasting resolution to problems in Ossetia and Abkhazia, but there is still uncertainty&#13;
regarding their final outcome.&#13;
&#13;

Transport Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Implementation Unit - The Transport Reform and Rehabilitation Center (TRRC)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    One of the great challenges of the Government of Georgia in the short term is to plan and&#13;
organize the reform of the transport sector. Such efforts would follow up on indicators reflecting&#13;
changes in property ownership and means of production, from the state to the private sector. In this&#13;
context, the reform of the transport sector would affect the structure and functions of various sectoral&#13;
agencies and their mutual relationships. Their staff will have to adapt to new management styles and&#13;
objectives. Changes, which would take place gradually, would affect all levels and all sub-sectors. In&#13;
order to minimize upheavals, the approach to sector reform must be carefully planned and designed and&#13;
the process well managed.&#13;
Basic Requirements&#13;
2.     To succeed in this process, reforms need to build on existing technical skills and consider&#13;
cultural and social aspects. Remedies must be applied judiciously so that disruptions of functions and&#13;
linkages within the system are minimized. In order to successfully implement and sustain the proposed&#13;
changes, it is important, that:&#13;
i)    the Government of Georgia is committed at the highest level and provides leadership and&#13;
support;&#13;
ii)    such agencies of the transport sector as Directorates, Enterprises and Services,&#13;
participate in their own process of conversion;&#13;
iii)   the development of the legal and regulatory framework and sectoral policies is&#13;
coordinated;&#13;
iv)   the law and policies established are adapted by each organization and agency according&#13;
to its function, and the organizations can benefit from the reform process;&#13;
v)    the plan and programs for transformation are flexible to increase credibility; and&#13;
vi)    human resources receive adequate training according to the need.&#13;
Most importantly, to succeed, Georgia needs an organization which would enunciate the development&#13;
goals, validate them at the highest level, allocate authority and responsibility, and coordinate and control&#13;
the process of the reform. In this process, such an organization would determine the required action steps&#13;
and their timing, as well as allocation of capital and human resources. Basically, it would manage and&#13;
coordinate the entire process of reform of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Coordination and Management of the Reform Process&#13;
3.      Existing sectoral institutions are not well suited to a market-based economy and there are few&#13;
people in the sector who may have in-depth knowledge on how a transition from centralized to market-&#13;
based economy should happen and be managed. Georgia does not have presently an organization in the&#13;
sector which would be capable of carrying out these tasks.&#13;
4.    However, the recently established Center for Problems of the Euro-Asian Transport Corridor&#13;
under the Head of State could become a core element and play an integral role in the process of&#13;
converting the sector. The Center could be expanded in manpower to include the existing transport&#13;
coordination group. The name will be changed and simplified to Transport Reform and Rehabilitation&#13;
Center (TRRC). The staff of this TRRC will be empowered by training to obtain the necessary skills to&#13;
carry out the tasks necessary for conversion of the sector. It is envisaged that the activities of the TRRC&#13;
would be supervised by a Steering Committee appointed by the Head of State. The Steering Committee&#13;
would include representation from the Council of Ministers. Additionally, there will be a Training Unit&#13;
attached to the TRRC. This Unit will have a small number of permanent staff and a well defined&#13;
program for training young professionals, and re-training sector executives, to prepare them for dealing&#13;
with the sector's challenges. It has to be emphasized that only by establishing a clear institutional&#13;
structure and defining responsibilities of all people and organizations involved in the conversion process,&#13;
the sectoral reform could succeed.&#13;
TransRort Reform and Rehabilitation Center (IRRC)&#13;
5.    TRRC Structure and Function. As described in the above paragraph, it is envisaged that the&#13;
TRRC will become responsible for converting the transport sector to a market-based economy. The&#13;
project staff of the TRRC will consist of its Director, his deputy, an accountant, a procurement specialist,&#13;
a transport specialist, a lawyer, one policy/institutional specialist, and the necessary administrative support&#13;
staff. Their duties will be to: i) represent the TRRC in contacts with project agencies; ii) be in charge&#13;
of specific actions corresponding to the reform program in the sector; iii) coordinate issues resolution&#13;
among sub-sectors as necessary; iv) contribute to the planning process and development of new policies;&#13;
v) carry out other tasks to promote national transport safety; vi) keep the project accounts; and vii)&#13;
coordinate and manage procurement.&#13;
6.    In order to sequence correctly the steps in the process of sector reform, it may be desirable for&#13;
the TRRC to employ services of an expatriate transport economy expert, who could work in the country&#13;
on the basis of a medium term contract. Such expert would be in an advisory position to the Chief of&#13;
the TRRC and his main task would be to ensure consistency of the reform process.&#13;
7.    In addition to the responsibility for conversion of the sector, the TRRC will coordinate the&#13;
preparation of the Transport Rehabilitation Project. This is expected to be prepared within one year.&#13;
In the context of sector reform and project preparation, the TRRC may consult with the top executives&#13;
of the land (road, railways and pipelines), maritime (ports and shipping) and air (airlines and airports)&#13;
transport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;

How the System Will Operate&#13;
8.    Besides carrying the main responsibility for reforming the sector, the TRRC will propose&#13;
periodically and formally to the Head of State the policies to be adopted in the sector. Acceptance of the&#13;
policies will be followed by official executive and legal action. The TRRC, once the decree or the&#13;
respective legal document has been dictated, will be responsible for the follow-up on its dissemination,&#13;
implementation, and enforcement. Subsequently, the TRRC will comment on action programs proposed&#13;
by each sector agency. If the TRRC would determine that a newly established policy would require some&#13;
additional program, then the TRRC may  recommend it to the agency. The action programs will&#13;
designate the tasks and the time involved to their completion, as well as the frequency of reporting,&#13;
monitoring and controls. Extensions of agreed-on time tables will be handled as an exception, by special&#13;
request through the TRRC to the Head of State. This request will be evaluated by the TRRC and,&#13;
following its approval, might be presented to the Head of State.&#13;
Main Policy Subjects&#13;
9.     The main policy subjects that are expected to be addressed by the TRRC are the following:&#13;
(a)    Sector Deregulation. Sector deregulation refers to: simplification of laws, decrees and rules.&#13;
It aims at generalizing the right of entry to sector activities and removing controls and procedures&#13;
which make transport services complicated and more expensive. It is expected that the size of&#13;
the public services associated with the sector would decrease. The public function would amount&#13;
to recording and monitoring, ex-post, of sector activities.&#13;
(b)    Privatization of Transport Services. The transport services will be transferred to the private&#13;
sector on the basis of specific plans and programs after appropriate selection and announcement&#13;
of the mechanism to be used in each case. Every opportunity and juncture allowing the&#13;
privatization of any enterprise, or part of it, will be taken.&#13;
(c)    Price LUberalization. Price liberalization represents a stimulus to free competition. Fixed prices&#13;
are incompatible with a market economy and their elimination will be a subject of a specific&#13;
program. Under this concept it will be important to adopt legislation and establish some rules and&#13;
an organization in charge of preserving free competition, penalizing monopolistic practices and&#13;
defending the freedom of personal and corporate initiative.&#13;
(d)    Cost Recovery. The only way to maintain a healthy balance between public investment and&#13;
availability of the necessary infrastructure in a country, is to create mechanisms to recover the&#13;
associated costs from the users. Every person or enterprise will pay for the full costs of the&#13;
goods or services which they use. The different ways to recover those amounts are, for example,&#13;
various taxes, license fees, tolls, etc. They will be the subject of specific programs. In this way,&#13;
infrastructure could be maintained, improved, and expanded.&#13;
(e)    Foreign Investment. The regime under which foreign investments will be approved will operate&#13;
centrally, and its rules will apply to all economic sectors. In this context, the TRRC's role will&#13;
be limited to providing information regarding the relevant legislation and/or regulation.&#13;

Financial Projections - Highway Concern&#13;
Notes and Assumptions on the Attached Financial Projections&#13;
1.    Cashflow projections for the Highway Concern were developed on the basis of the road recovery&#13;
system defined in the draft law on road user approved by Parliament on September 2, 1995. It was&#13;
assumed that proceeds from this road recovery system would not be available before 1996. Listed below&#13;
are the other main assumptions used in the projections (tables pages 4 and 5).&#13;
Table page 4: Key Assumptions for Cashflow Projections&#13;
2.    Motor Vehicle Fleet: A conservative assumption that there would be no growth in the motor&#13;
vehicle fleet was adopted. Data is based on 1993 information collected by the (former) Ministry of&#13;
Transport.&#13;
3.    Vehicle Operating Ratios: The ratios are defined as the number of vehicles in working condition&#13;
divided by the total number of vehicles for each of the vehicle categories: cars, trucks and buses. These&#13;
numbers were discussed with the Highway Concern and assumed constant over the projection period.&#13;
4.    Incoming Border Traffic of Vehicles Registered Abroad: These numbers, shown in vehicles per&#13;
day (vpd), represent the total incoming border traffic of vehicles registered abroad at Tsiteli Hidi (Azeri&#13;
border), Lagodekhi (Azeri border), Sarpi (Turkish border), Vale (Turkish border), Larsi (Russian&#13;
border), Leselidze (Russian border), Guguti (Armenian border), and Sadakhalo (Armenian border). It&#13;
was assumed that no traffic was coming through Abkhazia (Leselidze), and that traffic at Vale was&#13;
negligible.&#13;
5.    In addition, based on traffic figures provided by the Highway Concern and after discussion with&#13;
officials of the Highway Concern, it was assumed that 15% of the total incoming border traffic of&#13;
vehicles registered abroad was cars, 55% trucks and 30% buses.&#13;
6.    Finally, the conservative assumption that this traffic would not grow over the projection period&#13;
was made.&#13;
7.    Fuel Consumption: This item represents the estimated total consumption of fuel (diesel and&#13;
gasoline) by vehicles in Georgia. Again, this estimate was held constant over the projection period.&#13;
8.    Avg. Fuel Price (Gasoline and Diesel): Prices of gasoline and diesel in Georgia currently are at&#13;
about the World levels. They were assumed to remain constant over the projection period.&#13;
9.    Ave. Car-Truck-Bus Horse Power: These figures indicate the average units of horse power for&#13;
each vehicle category in Georgia.&#13;
10.   Incoming Border Crossing Tax: This item refers to the tax on vehicles registered abroad entering&#13;
Georgia, as defined by the draft law on road user charges proposed to Parliament. The draft law defines&#13;
the tax amounts according to the size, axle load and horse power of each vehicle. The figures given in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
the table refer to average tax levels for each vehicle category. The proceeds of this tax are calculated&#13;
as the annual incoming border traffic of vehicles registered abroad times the tax (in $/entry), for each&#13;
vehicle category (cars, trucks and buses), times the collection performance ratio (see below).&#13;
11.   Collection performance for the incoming border crossing tax was assumed to increase from 20%&#13;
in 1996 to 60% by year 2000, and remain constant thereafter. This assumption takes into account initial&#13;
tax implementation and enforcement difficulties, and high incentives for tax evasion given the high tax&#13;
levels.&#13;
12.   Annual Domestic Vehicle Registration Tax: This item represents the yearly domestic vehicle&#13;
registration tax, based on horse power, as defined by the draft law on road user charges proposed to&#13;
Parliament. The tax was assumed to apply to all the domestic vehicles which are in working condition.&#13;
In other words, its proceeds are calculated as the total motor vehicle fleet times the vehicle operating ratio&#13;
times the tax (in $/horse power), for each vehicle category (cars, trucks and buses), times a collection&#13;
performance ratio.&#13;
13.   Collection performance for the vehicle registration tax was assumed to increase from 20% in 1996&#13;
to 70% by year 2000. This assumption takes into account initial tax implementation and enforcement&#13;
difficulties, high incentives for tax evasion given the high tax levels, and the fact that part of the vehicle&#13;
fleet is in conflict zones (e.g. Abkhazia).&#13;
14.   Fuel Taxes: They are defined in the draft law on road user charges as a percentage (5%) of the&#13;
value-added on fuel and lubricants. Full collection of these taxes is assumed to be reached by year 2000.&#13;
15.   Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Needs: Under this heading lies a possible road maintenance&#13;
and rehabilitation program starting from 1996. This program was defined according to road user charge&#13;
proceeds and priority needs. Surface dressing (potholes) as well as critical repairs on bridges and some&#13;
road equipment would be fixed as a priority; overlays and reconstruction would be undertaken only where&#13;
necessary and as funds become available (e.g., limited reconstruction would not start before 1998).&#13;
Provisions for machinery and spares would only occur in 1996 and 1997, as road maintenance and&#13;
construction units would be privatized by 1997.&#13;
16.   For 1995, officials of the Highway Concern estimated that realistically only about $500,000&#13;
would be available from the state budget for road maintenance and rehabilitation. This translates into&#13;
about 71 km of surface dressing (pothole fixing) at $7,000 per kilometer.&#13;
17.   Highway Concern Staff: Highway Concern officials indicated that only about 8,000 of the&#13;
original 22,000 employees are currently being paid. Staff of the Highway Concern would be brought&#13;
down to 1,000 employees by 1999, as maintenance and construction units become private. Of the 8,000&#13;
paid employees of the Highway Concern, about 5,500 are estimated to work in maintenance and&#13;
construction units, and would become private sector employees. About 1,500 of the remaining 2,500&#13;
employees were assumed to be laid-off by 1998 in a staff reduction program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
Table page 5: Cashflow Projections&#13;
18.   This table indicates the sources and applications of funds as a result of current and prospected&#13;
budget allocations, road recovery system proceeds, and the above mentioned program of road&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation. All figures are in 1995 US$.&#13;
19.   Budget Allocation: For 1995, the projections assume that the state budget allocation will be the&#13;
only source of funds for the Highway Concern. This allocation, estimated at $1,000,000, would cover&#13;
salaries, wages and administrative expenses and some pothole fixing (worth $500,000 or about 71 km of&#13;
surface dressing, as mentioned earlier). Starting from 1996, as the road recovery system begins to be&#13;
implemented, no state budget allocations would be directed to the Highway Concern. All expenditures,&#13;
including salaries, wages, severance, administrative and headquarters expenses, as well as road&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation needs would be exclusively covered by road user charge proceeds.&#13;
20.   Divestiture of Assets: This item indicates the revenues (estimated at about $1 ml) generated by&#13;
the privatization of maintenance and construction units. The privatization process would be completed&#13;
by 1997.&#13;
21.   World Bank Loan Borrowing: The projections include a World Bank loan borrowing of about&#13;
$5 ml in 1996.&#13;
22.   Salaries and Wages: These were assumed to increase from current $4.7 per month to about $20&#13;
per month in 1996, and remain constant thereafter.&#13;
23.   Severance: The projections assume that a severance payment of 2 years of salary would be given&#13;
to the 1,500 employees laid-off in the staff reduction program (see para. 17 above).&#13;
24.   Other expenses:  These include administrative and headquarters expenses of the Highway&#13;
Concern.&#13;
25.   Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation: This heading includes all the expenses linked to the&#13;
proposed road maintenance and rehabilitation program. The following cost estimates were factored in the&#13;
projected expenses:&#13;
-     Surface Dressing (potholes):      $7,000 per km.&#13;
-     Overlays:                          $32,000 per km.&#13;
-     Reconstruction:                   $132,000 per km.&#13;
26.   Debt Service: The interest rate would be of about 7.6%, and the loan would be repaid over five&#13;
years after a one year grace period.&#13;

Transport Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Contracting of Road Construction and Maintenance Units&#13;
Obiective&#13;
I .    The objective of each enterprise is to perform, under specific contract with the Highway Concern,&#13;
works related to the maintenance, rehabilitation and construction of roads and associated structures. It&#13;
will be privately owned and allowed to perform other construction work.&#13;
Staff&#13;
2.    Initially the enterprises will be formed by ex-professionals and interested workers previously&#13;
employed by construction units operating for the Highway Concern. (How many to employ and under&#13;
which conditions, is a matter to be decided by the enterprise's management.)&#13;
Assets&#13;
3.     The main asset of the enterprise will be the operative capacity of its staff, and capital assets&#13;
(machinery and equipment) which could be owned, directly purchased, if the enterprise has the financial&#13;
capacity, or acquired from the Highway Concern, in accordance with the rules established by the Ministry&#13;
of Public Property, in the context of the privatization program.&#13;
Contract&#13;
4.     The initial contracts between the Highway Concern and the enterprise, provided that it is found&#13;
eligible under Bank Guidelines, will be for road repairs, including all elements of the road cross section,&#13;
and will be part of the Program of Emergency Repairs defined under the Transport Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
Quality standards of performance would be included in the contracts.&#13;
Price&#13;
5.     The contract price will be given by such a formula as:&#13;
Price =  # road surface units to be repaired under the contract x  unit repair cost */&#13;
[*/ Detemnined by bidding prcess]&#13;
The unit repair cost would reflect the state of road disrepair, variable direct costs, indirect costs,&#13;
mobilization costs, as well as profit and taxes to be paid by the enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
Payments&#13;
6.    Payments from the Highway Concem will be made proportionally to the progress of the&#13;
contracted work and will take place on a regular basis (e.g., monthly). This progress will be accredited&#13;
by a designated supervisory unit of the Highway Concern. The supervisory unit will act as the technical&#13;
counterpart of the enterprise for the purposes of the contract, including quality control. An advance&#13;
payment of about 15% of the value of the contract may take place to facilitate the purchase of materials&#13;
and provide some working capital. The equipment made available by the Highway Concern either under&#13;
a rental, leasing or purchase agreement, will be reflected as a deduction in every statement of payments.&#13;
Asphalt and Stone Crushing Plants&#13;
7.    The Highway Concern will allow free choice to contractors to procure the most adequate&#13;
materials to the work site(s). Any rental costs applicable, will be deducted from the gross amount due&#13;
in each statement of payments.&#13;
Payment Deductions&#13;
8.    In each statement of payments, the gross amount to be paid would be reduced by: (i) a proportion&#13;
of the 15% advance payment; (ii) any cost of equipment rental, leasing or purchase as agreed, including&#13;
the rental cost of asphalt and stone crushing plants; and (iii) a 5% of the gross payment due, to serve&#13;
as a guarantee for the delivery of the works to the satisfaction of the concern. The balance will be fully&#13;
paid to the enterprise upon the satisfactory completion of the works. The guarantee funds will be&#13;
deposited in a financial institution acceptable to the enterprise under the name of the Highway Concern,&#13;
in accordance with mutually agreeable conditions.&#13;
The Highwav Concern&#13;
9.    The Highway Concern will cease to be responsible for the execution of road works. It will open&#13;
and maintain a Registry of Contractors and will operate on the basis of competitive bidding among&#13;
enterprises included in the registry.  All contractors, local or foreign, fulfilling the criteria for such&#13;
enterprises under Bank Guidelines, will be eligible for inclusion in the Registry.&#13;

Transport Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Rental and Leasing of Highway Concern Equipment&#13;
1.    Under the Transport Rehabilitation Project, an Emergency Road Repair program is one of the&#13;
established priorities. The required works will be carried out by private and independent enterprises.&#13;
To assist the development of the a local contracting industry, the Highway Concern will make available&#13;
under mutual agreement its equipment pool. The Highway Concern will purchase spares, make repairs,&#13;
and when necessary, purchase equipment with Project funds. The equipment and parts will be valued&#13;
at market prices and will be available to any contractor. On the basis of this value, for each item, a&#13;
rental leasing fee or a sale price will be established.&#13;
2.    As an example of the monthly fees involved, the following table has been calculated. It refers&#13;
to an estimated market value of equipment of $10,000 with a life of 60 months, interest rate of 0.7 to&#13;
1.0% per month for rental and lease, and 1.0 to 1.5% per month for sales.&#13;
-     Rental: $258 for periods inferior to 40 months&#13;
-     Lease:        $288 to $305 for 40 month leases&#13;
$238 to $255 for 50 month leases&#13;
$205 to $222 for 60 month leases&#13;
-     Sale:         $500 to $524 with 20 months for full purchase&#13;
3.    The alternative to use in each case will depend on the duration of the contract, type and future&#13;
use of the equipment, and the financial capacity of the enterprises.&#13;

Financial Projections - Railway Department&#13;
Notes and Assumptions on the Attached Financial Projections&#13;
1.    Financial projections for the Railway Department, reflecting the financial adjustment and restructuring&#13;
plan proposed in Chapter IV (Financial Aspects) were developed. Listed below are the notes and assumptions&#13;
used in these projections, presented by table. In all tables, the currency unit is constant 1995 US$.&#13;
Table page 3: Key Assumptions and Income Statement Projections&#13;
2.     Traffic: Passenger traffic was assumed to decrease from current levels (4.4 million passengers per year)&#13;
to about 2 million passengers per year by year 2000, as a result of tariff increases. This traffic would then&#13;
grow by 1 % per year. Freight traffic (in tons) was assumed to grow by only 1 % per year over the projection&#13;
period. Today, the humanitarian food aid cargo makes up for most of the railway freight operations. Such&#13;
traffic is temporary. In the short to medium term, humanitarian freight traffic is likely to decrease, whereas&#13;
other freight traffic would progressively increase in line with the overall economic recovery of Georgia. The&#13;
average trip for passenger transport was assumed to remain constant over the projection period; for freight, it&#13;
was assumed to decrease from current 350km to about 300km by 1998 as the share of domestic traffic increases.&#13;
3.     Average Passenger/Freight Tariffs: Average passenger tariffs were assumed to increase from current&#13;
(1st half of 1995) UScents 0.05 per pass.km to UScents 3.00 per pass.km by 2000. As for average freight&#13;
tariffs, they would increase from current USc 3.07 per ton.km to USc 4.00 per ton.km by 1997. An increase&#13;
of up to 1.5 times the current freight tariff is already scheduled by the railway department, starting September,&#13;
1995.&#13;
4.     Railway Staff: Currently, the railways employ 18,191 people, of which 6,590 are not paid (technical&#13;
unemployment). Unpaid staff would be laid-off by 1996 and paid staff levels would be brought down to about&#13;
10,000 by 1998, as a result of a staff reduction program reflecting current traffic levels and the size of the&#13;
railway network.&#13;
5.     Average Salarv: It was assumed to increase from current (1994) $6.6 per month to about $20 per&#13;
month in 1996, and remain constant thereafter.&#13;
6.     Operating Revenues: Passenger and freight operations revenues grow with traffic and tariff increases.&#13;
Baggage and mail revenues were assumed to grow by 15% per year, to reflect increased baggage and mail&#13;
activity and tariffs which would cover costs.&#13;
7.     Operating Expenses: Assumptions on operating expenses are as follows:&#13;
Salary and Wages:           calculated as the annual average salary times the staff level.&#13;
Social Benefits:            costs grow in line with salaries.&#13;
Operation and Maintenance:  costs grow by 5% per year, as costs of materials and services&#13;
increase, and as aging equipment requires more maintenance.&#13;
Fuel and Power:             costs grow with electricity prices and traffic. Electricity prices&#13;
were assumed to increase by 50% from 1995 to 1996, as a&#13;
result of the restructuring of the power sector.&#13;
Severance:                  2 years of salary.&#13;
Other expenses:             these expenses mainly relate to capital repairs. As operations&#13;
become more efficient and only necessary capital repairs are&#13;
carried out, "other expenses" were assumed to decrease by 5%&#13;
per year.&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 6&#13;
Table page 4: Sources and Applications of Funds&#13;
8.     World Bank Loan Borrowing and Other Donors Assistance: Total borrowing from the World Bank and&#13;
other donors to be defined would amount to about $6.6 million, and would take place in 1996.&#13;
9.     Debt Service: The interest rate on the borrowing would be of about 7.6%, and the repayment period&#13;
five years with a one year grace period.&#13;
Table page 5: Balance Sheets at Years Ending December 31&#13;
10.    Gross Fixed Assets: A recent Government decree calls for an asset revaluation, to be implemented on&#13;
October 1, 1995. Assets will be revalued 12.7 times, from current US$13 million to about US$171 million.&#13;
This revaluation factor was calculated by the Ministry of Finance for all enterprises in Georgia to account for&#13;
inflation. Although a detailed railway-specific asset revaluation is needed for the railway department, the asset&#13;
revaluation assumptions in the projections follow the Government decree.&#13;
11.    Accumulated Depreciation: It was adjusted for 1995 in line with asset revaluation. Old assets (prior&#13;
to 1995) were estimated to be fully depreciated in 9 years (i.e., a yearly average depreciation coefficient of&#13;
1 1.1 %). New assets (incorporated in the asset base after 1995) would be fully depreciated in 15 years (i.e.,&#13;
a yearly average depreciation coefficient of 6.7%).&#13;
12.    Capital Work in Progress: This item represents the first year of each capital investment.&#13;
13.    Accounts Receivable: Receivables are assumed to decrease to 30 days of revenues by 1999, down from&#13;
52 days in 1994.&#13;
14.   Inventories: They were assumed constant over the projection period.&#13;
15.    Other Assets: These were assumed to decrease to about $5 million by 1998, as a result of the selling&#13;
of unnecessary and non-transport related assets.&#13;
16.    Capital and Capital Reserve: Both items were assumed constant over the period.&#13;
17.    Accounts Payable: Payables are assumed to decrease to 3 months of expenses by 1999.&#13;
18.    Advances, Short Term Borrowing and Other Current Liabilities: All of these are assumed to remain&#13;
constant over the period.&#13;
Table page 6: Ratios of Financial Performance&#13;
19.    Profitability: Profitability for 1994 (and to a lesser extent, for 1995) looks high because of the high&#13;
"profits" shown by the railways accounts. As explained before (para. 1, page 1), these "profits" do not take into&#13;
account proper allocations for depreciation.&#13;
20.    Debt Financial Leverage: Debt Service Coverage is defined as the ratio of internal sources to the total&#13;
debt service (interest and principal). Interest Coverage is defined as the ratio of the operating profit before&#13;
interest and tax to the interest on the debt.&#13;

GEORGIA - Transport Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Railway Department&#13;
Current Infrastructure and Equipment Situation,&#13;
Physical Description&#13;
1.    Georgia has 1,569 km of railways, of which 725 km are main lines and 290 km with double&#13;
track. The entire network is electrified (Georgia was the first republic of the FSU to undertake&#13;
electrification of its railway network) with DC at 3.3 kV. Except for the narrow-gauge line Borjomi -&#13;
Bakuriani (38 km), all lines are in Russian broad gauge (1520).&#13;
2.    The backbone of the network is the former "Transcaucasian Railway" which, starting from&#13;
Moscow, runs 575 km across Georgia from the Russian border station Veseloe in the north-west via&#13;
Samtredia-Thilisi to the Armenian border town Airum in the south-east, and continues from there to&#13;
Yerevan. In Leninakan (Armenia), there is a connection to the Turkish (standard gauge) rail network.&#13;
From Tbilisi, 42 km of main line link the city to the border of Azerbaijan, providing via Baku the second&#13;
connection to the Russian network.&#13;
3.    The section between Zestafoni and Khashuri, climbing over the watershed between the Black and&#13;
Caspian Seas, passes through topography similar to a low mountain range somewhere in Middle Europe&#13;
(from 158 to 778 meters above sea level). The poor layout of the line with a minimum radii of 158 m&#13;
and steep gradients of up to 29.9 0/00 makes operations extremely difficult, especially during hard&#13;
winters.&#13;
4.    The Transcaucasian Railway dates back to 1872 and was completed in 1890, but other lines were&#13;
built as recently as 1970. Two branches connect the Black Sea ports with the Transcaucasian Line; these&#13;
are Samtredia-Batumi (106 km) and Senaki-Poti (41 kIn). Work on numerous new projects, like the new&#13;
Arkhot Pass Line from Orjonikidze to Tbilisi, or the completion of the second track between Ingiri and&#13;
Moliti, the branch lines Samntredia-Zulukidze and Telavi-Achmneta, and the Samtredia bypass had to be&#13;
abandoned.&#13;
5.    For political reasons, railway traffic is disrupted on the Transcaucasian line between Veseloe and&#13;
Ingiri (Abkhazia) and the Ossetia branch between Shindisi and Zkhinvali. Except for the Transcaucasian&#13;
line and its branches to Azerbaijan, Poti and Batumi, train operations have been reduced to a minimum&#13;
or abandoned. Thus, it is estimated that more than 95 % of the present traffic is performed on the core&#13;
764 kms (including the 2 km of line between Tbilisi Sort and the Armenia by-pass).&#13;
6.    Within this core network, there are 79 stations and branching-off points, of which two are big&#13;
marshalling yards at (Samtredia II and Tbilisi Sort). The average distance between operating points is 9.8&#13;
kan. Comparatively, the number of level crossings on the Transcaucasian Line (30 out of 75 on the whole&#13;
network) is low.&#13;
I/    This Annex is based on background information provided by M. Strohn, who has been working in Tbilisi since&#13;
March, 1995 under contract with GTZ.&#13;

Infrastructure and Equipment&#13;
7.     Bridges and structures: There are not only several bridges which have been severely damaged&#13;
as a result of the Abkhazia and Arrnenia/Azerbaijan conflicts but also many that need renewal for such&#13;
other reasons as age, deffered maintenance, or damages from excessive road traffic or floods. As for the&#13;
many tunnels--the most important one is between Zipa and Lichi on the main line with a lenth of 3,998m-&#13;
-no survey of condition has been conducted, and even immediate renovation needs have not been&#13;
reported. Buildings are generally in a hopeless condition, and do not accomnnodate modern signalling and&#13;
telecommunications equipment. Passenger and freight platforms at stations and on sidings are damaged&#13;
and unsafe in almost all cases.&#13;
8.     Permanent Way: The through lines of the core network--open line tracks and their continuation&#13;
in the stations--comprise 802 track kms with mainly heavy rails (R65); only 103 kms (13%) on the&#13;
Senaki-Poti branch line and some of Batumi-Samtredia and Tbilisi-Sadakhlo sections are light rails (R50).&#13;
Almost half of the sleepers are wooden and equipped with spike fastenings. On concrete sleepers, rails&#13;
are usually welded up to 700 m length. The tracks represent the typical Russian practice of over-design&#13;
and low levels of maintenance: there are 1,840 to 2,000 sleepers per km, which allows operation ofver&#13;
the track even if one third of the sleepers and fastenings are damaged. Ballast is generally of poor quality&#13;
and drainage is inadequate, especially along platforms. Embankments are not well maintained, and poor&#13;
slope protection as well as lush weeds contribute to the contamination of ballast. All of this results--in&#13;
spite of the fact that the average age of track is eleven years, and almost 50% of the tracks are less than&#13;
ten years old--in only 28% of the tracks being in a tolerable condition. 51 km must be considered&#13;
dangerous, and at least an additional 290 km need renewal within the next 5 years. Furthermore, it must&#13;
be noted that more than two-thirds of the tracks renewed during the last five years have already&#13;
deteriorated to an extent that speed must be restricted to 40 km/h or less. Turnouts are usually of type&#13;
300-1:11, or 200-1:9 if used only for freight trains. Double-slip and curved points are not in use. The&#13;
condition of the 735 turnouts on the through lines is yet to be surveyed, but a result similar to that of the&#13;
overall track condition must be expected.&#13;
9.     The Railway claims to have a few permanent-way machines (ballast screening machines SM2,&#13;
track/switch tamping machines WPRI200, renewal trains UK25, screwing machines, track recording&#13;
coaches) at their disposal, but except for a tamping machine that handles 1200 sleepers per hour, no&#13;
details about condition and availability were obtainable. There is a severe lack of such tools as saws,&#13;
screw clamps, and drilling machines.&#13;
10.   Signalling: On the routes of the core network there are 78 interlocking blocks comprising 5,177&#13;
switch units (a unit=switches + signals + track circuits). One third of the blocks are more than twenty-&#13;
five years old, only 13% have been put into operation within the last ten years; as a result of damage&#13;
and theft--mainly of impedance bonds (throttle transformers) and cables--only five of these are fully in&#13;
operation. In another twenty-eight interlocking blocks, only 30-50% of switches, signals and even track&#13;
circuits are in working order; this includes three key interlocking systems. In ten stations, all switches&#13;
in the through lines have been locked. Additionally, eleven interlocking plants have been taken out of&#13;
operation and the stations temporarily abandoned. In terms of switch units, it is estimated that only 36%&#13;
of the equipment is in working order. Power is supplied through Railway's 10 kV (220/380 V) feed line&#13;
system; there are no stand-by generators. 59 of the 74 line sections had been equipped with automatic&#13;
block, in many cases even for two-way-traffic, totalling 691 signals and 355 impedance bonds. Except&#13;
for signals and switch cabinets most equipment has been stolen, so that on almost the entire railway today&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
there is no section blocking. The same goes for all level crossing equipment; some level crossings are&#13;
worked locally but many remain unattended.&#13;
11.   Telecommunications: The condition of telecommunications is even worse: line cables have been&#13;
stolen partly or entirely on the sections Poti-Senaki-Abascha (53 kmn), Batumi-Saintredia (106 km),&#13;
Marneuli-Sadakhlo (29 km) and Gardabani-Bejuk Kjasik (12 kIn), leaving only 327 km (62 %) in&#13;
operation. In each of these sections there are two cables of type MKPAB (7*4*1.2+5*0.9+ 1*0.7) with&#13;
an average age of fifteen years. Out of twenty-seven telephone exchanges presently only thirteen work.&#13;
Radio systems are not state of art and also in a questionable condition. WFP's HF radio system has, of&#13;
course, considerably improved communications but cannot be used to permanently restore regular&#13;
station-to-station communication.&#13;
12.   Overhead Line and Traction Power Supply: The 3.3 kV-DC-catenary has non-flexible carrying&#13;
cable and is not in good condition. According to the last survey carried out six years ago, the contact&#13;
wire is well below minimum (8.21 mm) on 214 track km (27% of the core network). Catenary supports&#13;
are of either steel (minor corrosion) or concrete. The latter often topple after some time as a result of&#13;
poor footings. Traction power for the core network is supplied through thirty-two rectifier-substations&#13;
(plus three presently out of order) that are connected through 6, 10, 35 or 110 kV AC to the substations&#13;
of the 110/220/500 kV public network which includes twelve power plants (one thermal, eleven hydro).&#13;
The railway-owned rectifier-substations serve also a 10 kV AC feed line with drops to 220/380 V&#13;
transformers for consumers like stations, interlocking plants and switch heating systems. Power cuts are&#13;
still regular, lasting from four hours daily to up to several days. During the remaining time, contact line&#13;
voltage is likely to drop recurrently below 2 kV.&#13;
13.   Motive Power: In May 1995, the Railways had a total of 496 units of traction equipment: 280&#13;
were reported in working order. This includes 230 (in working condition: 110) electric, 159 (90)&#13;
diesel-electric locomotives and 107 (80) EMU traction units. The electric locomotives belong mainly to&#13;
the types VL10, VL1OU and VL11 (4600 kWh, 100 km/h, 184 to 200t, first years built 1961/1976); from&#13;
the old type VL8 (3660 kWh, 80 km/h, 184 t, 1953) only 86 (46) double units are left. (Addition&#13;
locomotives are also leased for use by the World Food Program). On the operational side, problems arise&#13;
from locomotives having their own crew, frequent change of locomotives, excessive demand through&#13;
increased travelling times, and the use of many light-engines in mountain pass sections.&#13;
14.   Rolling Stock: The freight wagon situation is still in the dark. Of the estimated 20,000 wagons&#13;
that jam not only sidings but also most of the main tracks, only some 5,000 are reported in operation.&#13;
The ownership of the remaining number is uncertain--disruption of both rail links to Russia may have left&#13;
many Georgian wagons in Russia and vice-versa--as is their technical condition. It must be expected that&#13;
more than half of the freight wagons are not fit for use, in many cases obviously due to the theft of such&#13;
important parts as even floors and walls for firewood or valuable metal parts, e.g. the aluminum covers&#13;
over the bearings. Assisted by GTZ, the Railways started a detailed census in May 1995 but did not&#13;
manage to complete it as of Aug 1, 1995. As far as operations are concerned, difficulties are linked to&#13;
excessive demand through increased travelling times, laborious shunting in jammed sections, and the poor&#13;
motivation of shunting crews. Many yards are jammed with damaged wagons and those waiting for&#13;
unloading, thus obstructing train operations and increasing shunting time and costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

15.   Power supply: Because trains exclusively use electric locomotives and signalling units get power&#13;
from the same source, public supply of power to the railways is a crucial factor for operations. A&#13;
schedule of switch-off times has been set up so that it should be possible to run a limited number of trains&#13;
anyway, but railway officials say there are still many unannounced power cuts. An evaluation of control&#13;
charts for two weeks in May 1995 (arbitrarily selected) shows, however, that except for the section&#13;
Tbilisi-Sadakhlo, which is fed from Armenia and where power was available only 83 % of the time, the&#13;
grade of power supply for the core network was between 92 % and 99 %. One must take into account that&#13;
the situation is much worse during the winter months, but even then the current level of operations could&#13;
be maintained almost unaffected if the supplier and the Railway stick to an agreed schedule. Total power&#13;
consumption was 336.0 mln kWh (0.921 mln kWh/day) in 1994 compared to 1,233.8 mln kWh (3.380&#13;
mln kWh/day) in 1989 and has further come down to 77.9 mln kWh (0.866 mln kWh/day) during the&#13;
first quarter of 1995. This includes 0.610 mln kWh/day for users other than the 3.3 kV DC traction; the&#13;
consumption of such users represents one third of the 1989 level. Because of the lack of meters for&#13;
power consumption, the share of users that are indispensable for operations cannot be determined.&#13;
Between January and March 1995, the daily traction power was still 0.256 mln kWh or 16.5% of that&#13;
in 1989; this is more than what the declined traffic performance would suggest. One reason for this--and&#13;
probably the most important one--is the heavy grid loss occurring as a result of the questionable method&#13;
of keeping all overhead lines powered to avoid theft even in cases where the track has been already&#13;
removed.&#13;
16.    Permissible Speed: In view of the overall condition of infrastructure, the Railway has decided&#13;
to restrict maximum speed to 40 km/h in general. In addition, there are temporary speed restrictions&#13;
between 5 and 25 km/h. This is as result of poor layout and geometry, lack of databases, operational&#13;
rules determined in Moscow, and cattle having free access to the tracks.&#13;
17.    Operating Program: The latest valid timetable dates back to 1987. Today, operations are&#13;
carried out more or less on an on-the-spot basis, without any programmed operational strategy.&#13;

Transport Rehabilitation Project&#13;
The Training Unit of the Transport Reform and Rehabilitation Center:&#13;
Promoting the Sustainability of Change&#13;
I.     Introduction&#13;
1.1    The provision of training, in order to introduce new skills and re-orient existing attitudes, is essential to&#13;
the introduction and sustainability of the change necessary to reform the transport sector in Georgia. The reform&#13;
envisioned under the project will involve both wide-spread change in institutional processes and procedures and&#13;
organizational restructuring. All people involved in the reform of the sector will have to adapt to change. For&#13;
example, on the one hand the staff of the sectoral agencies will have to understand and to learn how to support&#13;
radically redefined organizational missions; such support will require the acquisition of the new skills in corporate&#13;
planning, management, and operations that are needed to function in a market-based economy. On the other&#13;
hand, the district offices of the Highway Concern, which will be transformed into private enterprises, must learn&#13;
how to operate competitively on a cost-effective basis.&#13;
1.2    It is important to note that the transformation from the state planning mechanisms utilized under the Soviet&#13;
Period to a market-oriented and cost-effective approach requires the creation of a whole new institutional culture.&#13;
The creation of this culture assumes the commitment of the Government to the new policy directions supported&#13;
by the project. The effectiveness of training under the project, therefore, is dependent upon institutional changes&#13;
which only the Government can assure. Setting aside such considerations, it remains important as well to&#13;
remember that there is likely to be wastage and leakage in the offering of training within such a transitional&#13;
setting.' The design of the training to be offered under the project, however, will attempt to keep both at a&#13;
minimum.&#13;
1.3    Neither the reform process nor the human resource development necessary to support it can be carried&#13;
out over-night. The training to be provided under the project, therefore, is seen as part of a long-term process&#13;
and as an investment in the future. Accordingly, a balanced priority must be given in developing the training&#13;
program to such immediate needs of project implementation as training in contracting and to such long-termn&#13;
requirements for operation in the private sector as understanding cost analysis and depreciation.&#13;
1/     WASTAGE refers to training which does not meet the actual needs of the target group relative to the project or to the tasks&#13;
designated for the group. LEAKAGE refers to the movement of trained personnel out of the sector to some other position; in this project&#13;
most individuals receiving training would remain within the transport sector, but even those shifting out of the sector would take skills&#13;
with them which would contribute to overall economic productivity.&#13;

II.     Purpose and Structure&#13;
2.1    To facilitate the transitional period marked by various institutional changes, a Training Unit (TU) will&#13;
be established under the Transport Reform and Rehabilitation Center (TRRC), which is to be in charge of the&#13;
reform process for the sector. The main functions of this unit will be to: (i) organize training courses, seminars,&#13;
and workshops for executives, managers, and technical staff in the sector; and (ii) make public various types of&#13;
information related to the reform process in general and the training program in particular.2&#13;
2.2     The Training Unit will consist of three permanent staff: a director, who will be a regular staff of the&#13;
TRRC, one administrative assistant, and one secretary/typist.  Demonstrative of cost-effective practices,&#13;
supplemental short-term or intermediate services in support of training or the dissemination of information will&#13;
be obtained through contractual arrangements on an as-needed basis. Such services will include the preparation&#13;
and delivery of training. The unit itself will be limited to a contract administration role.&#13;
2.3     The TU director will report on programs and progress to the Chief of the TRRC and will be primarily&#13;
responsible for: (i) identifying training needs; (ii) organizing and contracting for courses and seminars; (iii)&#13;
liaison with other donors or project providing training for the sector; (iv) monitoring the results of training, and&#13;
(v) formulating training programs for the future. The director should be a Georgian training professional with&#13;
good organizational and interpersonal skills and an understanding of transport sector policy, management, and&#13;
operations. The director should also have, at the minimum, a basic conversational knowledge of English. One&#13;
secretary/typist would provide administrative support in the initial period. An administrative assistant, capable&#13;
of handling more complex administrative tasks would be hired at a later date.&#13;
MII.    TaLrget Audience&#13;
3.1     The training program will target two primary groups of people: (i) the sector executives, medium to high&#13;
level managers, and technical professionals who carry responsibility for various processes and/or mechanisms&#13;
within the process of reform or are concerned with operational responsibilities with the respective modes in the&#13;
transport sector, and (ii) key managers and supervisors staffing the evolving enterprises about to be formed from&#13;
the district offices of the Highway Concern (road sub-sector specific). 3&#13;
3.2     Both groups need to understand the overall concepts of market-based economics.  The first group,&#13;
however, will need a deeper understanding of economics and the restructuring of policy-making and regulation&#13;
as they affect the entire sector. The second group will need a more practical introduction to how to operate as&#13;
private firms, including both the principles of and methodology for costing work and the performance of road-&#13;
related services under contract.4&#13;
2/     In support of dissemination activities, the TU will prepare topical articles for inclusion as a regular feature in a newsletter to&#13;
be released by the TRRC. The TU will assist the TRRC in the overall production of this newsletter.&#13;
3/      The staff of the TRRC will receive specialized on-the-job training in such areas as procurement in conjunction with technical&#13;
assistance to be provided under the project. They in turn will assist with preparing training modules summarizing what they have learned.&#13;
These will be reviewed by the technical specialist provided by the project before further dissemination or use, and the modules would&#13;
become a training resource illustrative of Bank procurement guidelines.&#13;
4/      Training under the project will be a major source of capacity building for organizations in the transport sector, however, training&#13;
will be provided by other sources (See section IV).&#13;

IV.   Trainina Program Design&#13;
4.1    Overall Approach- A program consisting of courses, seminars, and workshops is to be developed&#13;
systematically, but as needs are identified or arise, and as the TRRC approves. Individual Terms of Reference&#13;
will be provided for contracting each specific need. Two types of courses will be provided: (i) "crash" courses,&#13;
representing a few days, or one/two-week intensive training, which will offer a quick presentation of new&#13;
concepts and subjects; and (ii) evening courses, where concepts are introduced at a slower pace. These two&#13;
options will allow organizations and individual trainees to make choices according to their needs.&#13;
4.2    The instruction of these courses will be based on the preparation of modules that can be readily offered&#13;
independently or in combination with one another and address the need to provide differently levels of expertise.&#13;
The instruction for the managers of the reform process will include some theory but would focus on the means&#13;
of instituting change. The instruction for contractors will be more practically oriented. In both cases the&#13;
examples used for instruction, including handouts, case studies and sample forms, will be designed to reflect the&#13;
specific realities of the transport sector in Georgia. Where appropriate instruction will include at-site instruction&#13;
and follow-up, on-the-job monitoring.&#13;
4.3    To the extent possible interactive methodology will be encouraged for instruction. Similarly, contractors&#13;
will be asked to use computers to prepare texts and present overhead materials. I The TU and the TRRC will&#13;
review all instructional materials before they are presented and at the conclusion of each course. This will not&#13;
only ensure quality control but will also enable iterative evolution of course material.&#13;
4.4    Topical seminars and workshops will also be offered. For example, as a follow up to the regional FSU&#13;
transport seminar which will be organized at the end of 1995, a national transport sector workshop of two to three&#13;
days will be organized in Georgia using funding under the credit. This workshop will disseminate the approach&#13;
to reform of the transport sector presented at the regional seminar to a national audience and will help clarify&#13;
issues within the Georgian context. Such a workshop with the participation of transport sector executives,&#13;
technical professionals, and senior managers of operations from each of the sub-sectors, could be extremely&#13;
enriching. A great benefit can be derived from sharing fears, problems, initial successes and experiences.&#13;
Inviting one or two speakers from countries where a similar reform process has taken place or is ongoing could&#13;
enhance the value of the workshop.&#13;
4.5    Sources- The trainers and lecturers who will be retained either individually or collectively under short&#13;
term contracts throughout the life of the project may be Peace Corps volunteers, Georgian professionals, or&#13;
foreign transport experts. In view of the lack of local knowledge of private sector operations and the need to fast-&#13;
track training, it will be necessary initially to rely more heavily on external sources. In order to stimulate&#13;
capacity building, however, as soon as possible local sources will be incorporated into the training program.&#13;
4.6    A review of such local sources will be made at the outset of the design of the training program by the&#13;
TU. The Georgian Academy of Science, for example, has recently begun to develop management courses in&#13;
conjunction with a cooperative program with the Business School of Harvard University. This program might&#13;
be a useful source for management training under the project. There are various universities in the Americas and&#13;
Europe which offer special training in transport economics and management. If such sources are used under the&#13;
project, efforts would be made to encourage twinning between these organization and local training institutions.&#13;
4.7    Training in support of privatization will also come from a variety of non-project sources, including&#13;
5/     For example, such readily available software as Power Point will be used for presentations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

activities supported by other donors. Agencies supporting the privatization process, however, will be more likely&#13;
to focus on the mechanics of establishing a firm rather than the elements of contracting. Coordination with such&#13;
agencies by the TU will minimize any overlap and ensure that the immediate needs of the project are met in a&#13;
timely fashion.&#13;
4.8    Identification of Needs- The training program  will be fit to the general needs of sector reform,&#13;
supporting the program of policy reform presented in the discussion of the Assistance Strategy for the tranLsport&#13;
sector discussed in the SAR; it will also support the activities described under the institutional building component&#13;
of the project. For example, major emphasis will be given to the deregulation and privatization of transport&#13;
services.  The Training Unit will play a pivotal role in preparing the sector staff and other professionals for&#13;
tackling the tasks necessary for such reform.&#13;
4.9     Because of the embryonic state of the private sector in Georgia, the transport sector sub-specialists of the&#13;
TRRC will play a special advisory role in the identification of training requirements. In order to assure the&#13;
general validity of the proposed content and timing for training, however, the TU will still need to conduct a&#13;
training needs assessment based on liaison with the various agencies and organizations whose staff have been&#13;
targeted for training. This assessment will be less rigidly structured than in the case where training is being&#13;
offered to a single organization with a pre-determined mission, but it will be essential in order to develop the&#13;
operational training plan for the project.&#13;
4.10   After the Training Unit is officially established, its director will start preparing a summary statement of&#13;
the overall training program and the preliminary implementation plan to be associated with that program.6 These&#13;
two documents would be reviewed internally by the TRRC. Following this review the TU will sponsor a training&#13;
workshop with representatives of the target groups identified for inclusion in the training program, relying on&#13;
liaison with the modal coordinators. Once the objectives of and the approach to training under the project have&#13;
been presented, feed-back will be invited from the participants. At the close of the workshop participants will be&#13;
asked to select representatives to serve on an advisory training committee not to include more than seven&#13;
members. This committee would serve on an informal basis providing advise and support to the TU on an as-&#13;
needed basis.&#13;
4.11  Following the workshop, liaison would continue with the modal coordinators to clarify issues and further&#13;
identify needs. Based on this assessment methodology the TU director will formulate short and long term training&#13;
needs and prepare the initial (6-months) training plan. After a final review by the TRRC sub-sector specialists,&#13;
the TU director will present the training package for approval by the Chief of TRRC. The TU will then prepare&#13;
the Terms of Reference for the training to be provided, assist the TRRC in tendering and contracting for the&#13;
required services, and disseminate infornation on the first tranche of training. The TU will also be responsible&#13;
for monitoring the quality of the training provided.&#13;
4.12   Curriculum-  Although the specific content of the curriculum  remains to be determined,  obvious&#13;
requirements can be suggested on the basis of the nature of the reform process and the contracting for&#13;
rehabilitation services for the road sub-component of the project.  7 At least ten functional main topics are&#13;
proposed relative to economics, finance , management, and procurement. Technical instruction will also be&#13;
61      The training plan will be prepared as either a bi-annual plan or as a quarterly rolling-plan. The plan would be action-oriented&#13;
with specific targets in terms of courses and enrollments.&#13;
7/      The contents of this paper are intended to serve as a guidelines for the design of the training component under the project. As&#13;
such, the suggestions relative to the curriculum should not be seen as pre-determinants. The TU will need to review the suggested topics&#13;
in relation to the existing realities and requirements revealed in the needs assessment conducted at the outset of the design of the training&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;

4.13    In order to facilitate the technical assistance programming under the project and the transfer of technology&#13;
in the future, English instruction will also be given. Although many Georgian specialists understand or can speak&#13;
varying degrees of English, there is a need to improve oral and written skills, especially in technical areas. For&#13;
this reason, there should be an English course (differentiated by level) offered on a continuous basis, preferably&#13;
evening classes, and if deemed necessary, a one-month crash course as an introduction.&#13;
V.      The Future of the Training Unit&#13;
5.1    Although training needs may diminish within a few years, the extent of the reform proposed for the&#13;
sector would indicate the need for continued human resource development services over an extended time-frame.&#13;
It is expected, that after the initial contracting effort by the TU is underway, a local technical training industry&#13;
would emerge.&#13;
5.2    Within such a context, it is possible that in a few years the TU itself could be privatized, becoming a&#13;
consulting firm specializing in the provision of training services to government agencies and private companies.&#13;
In such a case the TU would continue to retain a small permanent staff and subcontract supplemental services as&#13;
needed from newly evolved private sector sources. Alternately, the staff of the TU could be merged with the&#13;
staff of a more viable private sector competitor which might emerge during the life of the project.&#13;
5.3     Experience has shown that trainees place greater value on training for which they must pay a fee. They&#13;
pay more attention during sessions and more rapidly try to apply what they have learned when they have had to&#13;
pay for instruction. The introduction of fees for training, moreover, reinforces the overall concept of cost&#13;
recovery which is being introduced throughout the sector. In view of the limited resources available, however,&#13;
initial fees would have to be marginally structured. Since the production costs for training would have been&#13;
covered by the project, subsequently phased increases in fees would only have to cover the recurrent costs of&#13;
instruction.&#13;
8/     In view of the limited technology for surface dressing envisioned under the project, the current level of technical expertise will&#13;
be sufficient. The extent to which instruction in supervision will be necessary to ensure quality control will be reviewed in conjunction&#13;
with the development of modules on construction management. Should the introduction of such new technology as emulsions be envisioned&#13;
for the near future, training in support of this technology should be considered.&#13;

GEORGIA - Transport Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Environmental Analysis&#13;
I.     Introduction&#13;
1.1    The environmental review for the Georgia Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP) was conducted&#13;
in July 1995 in conjunction with the pre-appraisal mission for the TRP and resulted in the analysis&#13;
provided in this report. The conduct of the review included consultations with the Georgia State Concern&#13;
of Highways (SAKAVTOGZA, hereafter referred to as the Highway Concern), the design institutes under&#13;
the Highway Concern (both SAKGZAPROJECT and SAKGZAMETSNIEREBA), the Railway&#13;
Department, and the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEP).&#13;
1.2    The review addressed the requirements for IDA projects classified as "Category B" as opposed&#13;
to the full Environmental Assessment (EA) required for "Category A" projects. The requirements for&#13;
a full EA, however, were discussed in conjunction with the mission as part of a working session held on&#13;
August 2, 1995 with the Highway Concern, the design institutes, and the MoEP.&#13;
1.3    Discussions with the Railway Department indicated no areas of environmental concern related to&#13;
the project; the repair of bridges, repacking of ballast, and replacement of track which would be included&#13;
under the project would be confined to existing right-of-way. Additional consideration, however, was&#13;
given to the road sector--including site visits--and a mitigation plan was prepared to ensare the quality&#13;
control of monitoring for this sub-component.' Assuming compliance with the mitigation plan discussed&#13;
in Section V. , the sub-components for the rehabilitation of roads and railways under the TRP would be&#13;
cleared as enviromnentally sound. '&#13;
II.    Baseline Situation&#13;
2.1    The total length of the Georgia road network consists of 21,600 km of roads, of which 9,720 are&#13;
paved. The principal road is "the Magistral", a 728 Km route running from the Azeri border, through&#13;
Tbilisi to the Black Sea, and on to the Russian border. The alignment, longitudinal gradients, and slope&#13;
stability of this principal highway are generally acceptable, but the surface is seriously distressed as a&#13;
result of nearly non-existent maintenance in recent years. Certain side drains in the cuttings that form the&#13;
approaches to such structures as bridges, abutments and wing walls are deeply scarred. Otherwise there&#13;
is little evidence that such enviromnental problems as erosion have resulted from the construction of this&#13;
route. Erosion is evident, however, at several sites where new construction was initiated but was&#13;
abandoned for lack of funds.&#13;
2.2    The rationale for the proposed road rehabilitation under the project is to (i) eliminate the risks&#13;
1/     Since the environmental soundness of the railway component could be quickly verified, the major focus of the review&#13;
related to the road sub-component of the project. The remainder of this report, therefore, exclusively focuses on environmental&#13;
issues related to the road sector.&#13;
2/     Additional materials included in the project files ( see Annex 19 of the SAR).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 17&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
of losing valuable infrastructure, and (ii) remove existing physical bottlenecks to trade and humanitarian&#13;
assistance. The investment to be undertaken will not only increase road safety but will also avoid the&#13;
need for reconstruction of the network; such reconstruction by definition would involve far greater risk&#13;
to the environment than does the proposed rehabilitation and maintenance package identified for the&#13;
project.&#13;
2.3    The funds available under the project would be used to kick off a priority program of road&#13;
rehabilitation. It would consist of emergency repairs to stabilize and avoid further destruction of about&#13;
1,000 kmn of the main road network formed by the Magistral and important secondary feeder roads.&#13;
Included would be road clearing, drainage, and pothole patching for 26 segments of main and secondary&#13;
roads and selected bridge rehabilitation for nine segments of main road (for additional details on the&#13;
specific sections see Annex 6 of the SAR).&#13;
2.4    The portions of the road network targeted for emergency rehabilitation are diffused over the&#13;
central Magistral core of the road network. They were initially identified by the engineering staff of the&#13;
Highway Concern. The validity of the analysis was verified by samples in several regions conducted by&#13;
Bank missions.&#13;
III.   Direct Environmental Impacts&#13;
3.1    The environmental impact of most rehabilitation and maintenance projects in the road sector is&#13;
seen as positive rather than negative. With the retention of the existing alignments--as is the case in this&#13;
project--such projects offer not only more efficient vehicle operation and a corresponding reduction in&#13;
the emission of pollutants but also enable reduced nose and vibrations from traffic as well as offer the&#13;
opportunity to introduce mitigation actions relative to existing threats. The major sources of directly&#13;
negative impacts from maintenance projects, therefore, are considered to arise from (i) the production&#13;
and application of bituminous products; (ii) the quarrying of stone and gravel; (iii) such short-term impact&#13;
as noise, dust, and the disruption of traffic resulting from the execution of work under the project; and&#13;
(iv) the removal of waste materials; and (v) drainage and erosion. These five areas were each examined&#13;
in the course of the review.&#13;
3.2    Production and Application of Bituminous Products- According to the information provided by&#13;
SAKGZAMETSNIEREBA (alternately the Research Design Institute) during the mid 1980s there had&#13;
been as many as 110 asphalt plants in operation in support of the road sector. By the early 1990s,&#13;
however, the number had fallen to less than 70. The best of these were the 19 Teltomat units&#13;
manufactured in the former East Germany. Another thirty had been manufactured in Russia or other&#13;
parts of the soviet union and were also of good quality. The remaining plants came from various sources&#13;
and were considered to be of poor quality. At the time of the review none of the plants were in&#13;
operation, primarily because of a lack of raw materials. The resumption of operation, moreover, would&#13;
require varying degrees of rehabilitation at most sites.3&#13;
3.3    Until 1990 the Research Design Institute had monitored each of these plants, ideally preparing&#13;
3/    A list of the spare parts required for the resumption of operations was provided to the team.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 17&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
a detailed report for each site on an annual basis. Regulation of effluents and suspended particles was&#13;
based on both the projected emission from the plants and existing levels of background pollution from&#13;
other sources. National regulatory guidelines followed those used through the Soviet Union. Mitigation&#13;
plans were prepared for plants whose emission would result in violation of these standards. The institute&#13;
was empowered to issue a production stop order for any plant which failed to take the actions specified&#13;
in the mitigation plan.&#13;
3.4   In view of the limited amount of bituminous materials needed for the project, production could&#13;
be limited to the plants in the best condition, reducing both the number of spare parts needed and the&#13;
potential threat from pollution. The resumption of production was discussed with the Highway Concern,&#13;
the Research Design institute, and the MoEP, and the most cost effective strategy for asphalt production&#13;
for the project was under review.4 All three organizations felt that compliance with national guidelines&#13;
could be maintained, however, additional monitoring would be required at the time of start-up. A special&#13;
contract would be issued to the Research Design Institute for monitoring start-up activities in support of&#13;
the project; this would include a six month follow-up inspection. Equipment and training for emission&#13;
testing would be funded under the project. Subsequent costs for monitoring would be drawn from the&#13;
funding to be generated by the new user charges.&#13;
3.5    The assurance of quality control, including environmentally acceptable application of bituminous&#13;
materials, has been a joint responsibility of the Technical Department of the Highway Concern and the&#13;
research Design Institute. The need to prevent the leakage of oil, fuel, tar, and grease from asphalting&#13;
operations--which might contaminate near-by soil and groundwater supplies--was reviewed at the working&#13;
session. It was agreed that under the project the Research Design Institute would serve as a supervising&#13;
consultant. The appropriate methodology to control spillage and prevent contamination of adjacent areas&#13;
would be specified by the Research Design Institute. Compliance with these specification would be&#13;
written into the contracts signed with contractors and would be monitored by the Research Design&#13;
Institute. Failure to comply would result in a stoppage of work for initial violators and in a cancellation&#13;
of contracts for recurrent violators.&#13;
3.6    Quarrying and Crushing of Gravel- Under the Former Soviet Union gravel was obtained on the&#13;
basis of need from about 200 different sites. Exploitation at these sites was dependent upon clearance&#13;
by various authorities and included a limited environmental review. In the 1980's in an effort to obtain&#13;
a more reliable supply of materials, the Concern sought approval for removing barrow materials from&#13;
the flood plains adjacent to rivers whose currents have carried gravel down from mountain headwaters.&#13;
This practice was welcomed by local environmental authorities as a means of managing erosion and the&#13;
impact of flooding in valley basins as well as facilitating a reduction in the number of small quarries in&#13;
operation. Although small quarries have remained the major source for gravel, the Highway Concern&#13;
has obtained licenses to obtain gravel at four major river sites. The licensing of these sites and clearance&#13;
by the MoEP has required the conduct of a comprehensive environmental study for each site. In order&#13;
to ensure environmentally sound practices the license specifies from which areas gravel may be removed&#13;
and which areas must be left untouched.&#13;
3.7   In February 1995 the authority of the MoEP in the administration of the licensing system was&#13;
strengthened, and a new licensing system was scheduled for introduction on August 15, 1995. All&#13;
4/     Compliance and effective monitoring of production would be an essential elements of whatever strategy is selected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 17&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
existing licenses would be reviewed, and the Ministry has promised to promptly review the licenses held&#13;
by the Highway Concern for gravel extraction at both quarries and river sites. In view of the major stock&#13;
pile of gravel in-country, the needs of the project could be met without additional quarrying, but under&#13;
no circumstances would the TRP use sources for materials which were not reviewed and licensed under&#13;
the new system. The Highway Concern will prepare and present a plan to the Transport Reform and&#13;
Rehabilitation Center (TRRC) for the procurement of aggregates. To ensure compliance, contractors will&#13;
be required to provide certification of origin for such materials. The certification will guarantee that no&#13;
environmentally sensitive river beds or other sensitive areas are used as a source for such materials&#13;
3.8    Short-term Impact-  It is inevitable that there will be short-term impact from noise, dust,&#13;
vibration, and traffic congestion during the execution of works. The minimization of such impact would&#13;
result from: (i) the training to be offered on construction management and road maintenance, and (2)&#13;
as an element of contractual responsibility for enterprises undertaking work under the project.&#13;
Contractors would be required to prepare a mitigation plan for any site where the scale of impact is&#13;
judged to be sufficiently significant; particular attention would be given to the segments of road adjacent&#13;
to residential areas. The need for such a plan and environmental clearance would be reviewed as part&#13;
of the tendering process by the TRRC.&#13;
3.9    Waste Products- Technical specifications in use today in Georgia require the collection and&#13;
containment of all waste materials with bituminous content for subsequent disposal. The relative absence&#13;
of work today makes it impossible to verify compliance with this requirement. The Highway Concern&#13;
has agreed, in conjunction with the MoEP and the Research Design Institute to ensure that the limited&#13;
quantities of waste materials removed during rehabilitation activities undertaken under the project would&#13;
be properly collected, handled, and disposed. Future consideration would be given to research on the&#13;
recycling of these materials, but for the purpose of the project the Highway Concern would prepare a&#13;
plan for their disposition including locations and terraforming actions which would conform with&#13;
environmental standards and would require approval by the MoEP.5&#13;
3.10   Drainage and Erosion- The necessity for rehabilitation of certain segments of highway is the&#13;
direct result of improper drainage. Where such is the case, the Highway Concem would be obligated&#13;
to improve provisions for drainage (See Annex 6, SAR for segments identified for improved drainage).&#13;
Such activity would consider environmental issues; any activities necessitating the submission of designs&#13;
by Project Design Institute or the Research Design Institute would require clearance by the MoEP. The&#13;
need for such design and environmental clearance would be reviewed as part of the tendering process by&#13;
the TRRC. 6 The role of the MoEP relative to the issues discussed in Section 11 was reconfirmed at the&#13;
working session discussed above.&#13;
5/     Contractual responsibility and monitoring would again be used to ensure compliance under the project.&#13;
6/     Erosion has not been identified as a major problem in the analysis provided by the Highway Concem and reviewed&#13;
by World Bank missions, but it would be treated in a similar manner if it is identified during the tendering process.&#13;
&#13;

IV.   Indirect Environmental Impacts&#13;
4.1   Indirect environmental impacts possibly arising from any road rehabilitation project include such&#13;
long-term developments as increases in the growth of traffic and increases in the speed of traffic.&#13;
Although the rehabilitation and maintenance of the main road network is a pre-requisite for such&#13;
developments, a far higher correlation exists between such developments and national economic recovery.&#13;
4.2    These developments have a particular significance for road traffic safety. The repair of pot-holes&#13;
in high traffic areas envisioned under the project would increase road safety and more than balance any&#13;
likely increases in the level of traffic or speed of vehicles. Funds arising from the establishment of road&#13;
user chargers, moreover, will enable the initiation of a road traffic safety program in the future. The&#13;
importance of such considerations has been discussed with the Highway Concern and earmarked as a&#13;
priority in conjunction with second-phase rehabilitation activities.&#13;
V.    Institutional and Regulatory Considerations&#13;
5.1    The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEP), upgraded from  the status of a State&#13;
Commission, is the government organization responsible for making policy and promulgating standards&#13;
relative to environmental protection. The Ministry has made considerable progress in updating national&#13;
standards which originated in the Soviet period to comply with internationally recognized criteria. A&#13;
national environmental protection act has been drafted and is now before parliament; supportive&#13;
legislation covering such areas as soils, plants, forestry, and the transit of wastes have already been&#13;
passed.&#13;
5.2    Regulatory and licensing systems currently exist which specifically require consideration of&#13;
environmental issues in the design and implementation of development projects. The MoEP must clear&#13;
all designs for road works ranging from simple rehabilitation to more comprehensive new construction.&#13;
Discussions of regulatory procedures in recent years indicates marginal capacity for follow-up activities,&#13;
and priority must be given to the resumption of monitoring activities and collaborative consultation&#13;
between the MoEP, the Highway Concern, and the Research Design Institute. The MoEP is confident,&#13;
however, that the review of monitoring practices to be undertaken in association with the project would&#13;
be adequate to ensure compliance by the TRP with national standards. Additional review would be&#13;
required for future projects involving major construction components.&#13;
5.3    Air pollution has been a major problem for certain urban areas in Georgia for at least two&#13;
decades. Although average levels in such areas in the early 1990s well exceeded the average daily&#13;
Maximum Permissible Concentrations (MPC), current levels have fallen as a result of the drastic down-&#13;
turn in industrial production. The production of construction materials has not been identified as a major&#13;
source of air pollution and is not included among the priority targets for national environmental&#13;
management. The project would enable the resumption of monitoring activities and introduce emission&#13;
testing not previously practiced in Georgia. This would include both the testing of emissions from asphalt&#13;
plants and the introduction of a new system for testing automobile emissions. Terms of reference for the&#13;
later have already been prepared for implementation under private sector operation (See Annex 19, SAR).&#13;
5.4    Responsibility for environmental issues currently falls under the Technical Department of the&#13;
Highway Concern. The Chief Engineer heading this department participated in the working session and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 17&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
would be earmarked for participation in any review of legislation or standards relevant to roads or&#13;
dissemination activities sponsored by the MoEP. Although the current level of skills in the department&#13;
is adequate for the requirements of the TRP, consultations during supervision mnissions and training under&#13;
the project as well would enable long-term institutional strengthening of the Highway Concern. Particular&#13;
emphasis would be given to the monitoring responsibilities of the Highway Concern in conjunction with&#13;
the Research Design Institute. Training in construction management and road maintenance would also&#13;
take into account environmental issues, and responsibility for environmental safeguards during&#13;
construction would be specified in contract documents to be signed for the execution of civil works under&#13;
the project.&#13;
VI.   Mitigation Plan&#13;
6.1   In order to assure quality control of environmental issues under the project, the MoEP has agreed&#13;
to establish a special task force exclusively devoted to assisting the project. This task force would liaise&#13;
directly with the Highway Concern and the Research Design Institute. The Highway Concern would&#13;
advise the TRRC of all activities in support of environmental monitoring and mitigation, and the TRRC&#13;
would assist with the contracting of any special services or the procurement of equipment required to&#13;
support the mitigation plan. The essential elements of the mitigation plan are specified in Table 1, keyed&#13;
to the four issues identified in section III above.&#13;
VII.  Broader Environmental Issues&#13;
7.1    Although during the Soviet Period the Research Design Institute was considered one of the&#13;
premier research centers in the Soviet Union, it was cut off from research and studies conducted outside&#13;
the Soviet Bloc relative to road construction and maintenance. During this period a wide range of&#13;
findings evolved with environmental implications relative to both the use of materials and appropriate&#13;
technologies. These findings need to be reviewed by environmental and design specialists in Georgia to&#13;
ascertain their validity for the local environmental setting.&#13;
7.2    Consistent with the overall strategy of the project, assistance would be given to support the&#13;
assessment and monitoring essential to mitigation for the rehabilitation package being funding by the&#13;
project. Expanded research activities, however, could be financed out of funds to be generated by the&#13;
road user charge system to be introduced in conjunction with the policy reform component of the project.&#13;
7.3    Consultations during the design phase of the project have not only reinforced the importance&#13;
accorded by the donor community to compliance with internationally accepted environmental standards&#13;
but also a created a context and mechanisms for increased communication and cooperation at the local&#13;
level. Review of the licensing and monitoring processes would be based on a collaborative approach&#13;
including the three major stakeholders. Thus, although the nature of civil works to be supported under&#13;
the project does not warrant a fully participatory approach, discussion during the mission and&#13;
collaborative actions in conjunction with supervision will provide an introduction to sector managers of&#13;
the concepts necessary for the adoption of a participatory approach in future environmental assessment.&#13;

Table 1&#13;
ISSUES        |                           MITIGATIVE ACTIONS&#13;
1. Production and    Emission reporting by the Research Design Institute would be reviewed by the task&#13;
Application of       force of the MoEP. Current reporting would be upgraded by the testing of actual&#13;
Bituminous           emissions. The initiation of operations at plants would require a start-up review and&#13;
Products             supplemental six month monitoring by the Research Design Institute. Plants would&#13;
not be allowed to operate which violate national emission standards; plants would be&#13;
monitored to minimize ground spillage and ensure proper operational procedures.&#13;
Specifications and training would be provided for correct applications by contractors&#13;
at work sites. The TRRC, the Highway Concern, and the Research Design Institute&#13;
would be responsible for monitoring compliance with these terms; initial violation&#13;
would result in the stoppage of work; recurrent violations would result in the&#13;
cancellation of contracts.&#13;
2. Quarrying of      The licensing of gravel quarries and the four river sites currently used by the&#13;
Stone and Gravel     Highway Concern would be reviewed by the MoEP. Clearance would require&#13;
proper site study, including hydrological and ecological specialists. Licenses would&#13;
be recurrently reviewed on the basis of specified time-frames. The TRP will use no&#13;
materials from unlicensed sites. A plan for the procurement of aggregates would be&#13;
prepared by the Highway Concern, and contractors will be required to provide&#13;
certificates of origin for such materials.&#13;
3. Short Term        The training provided to potential contractors would include mitigation planning for&#13;
Impacts: Noise,      such short-term impacts as noise, dust, vibration, and traffic congestion during the&#13;
dust, vibration,     execution of works. Contracts providing for rehabilitation services would include&#13;
traffic safety       clauses specifically requiring contractors to address these issues in the management&#13;
of their work. The TRRC, the Highway Concern, and the Research Design Institute&#13;
would be responsible for monitoring compliance with these terms; initial violation&#13;
would result in the stoppage of work; recurrent violations would result in the&#13;
cancellation of contracts.&#13;
4. Waste Materials   The training provided to potential contractors would include proper methodology for&#13;
the disposal of materials to avoid contamination of soils and waters adjacent to work&#13;
sites. Based on a plan approved in advance by the MoEP, the Highway Concern&#13;
would be responsible for stock piling and ultimately disposing or re-cycling waste&#13;
materials. The TRRC, the Highway Concern, and the Research Design Institute&#13;
would be responsible for monitoring compliance with these terms; initial violation&#13;
would result in the stoppage of work; recurrent violations would result in the&#13;
cancellation of contracts.&#13;
5. Drainage, and     Where improper drainage or erosion has caused the deterioration of a segment of&#13;
Erosion              road, the Highway Concern would make improvements before rehabilitation of that&#13;
segment (See Annex 6 for sections specifically designated for improved drainage).&#13;

Transport Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Economic Rate of Return Analysis&#13;
1.    The Economic Rate of Return of the Transport Rehabilitation Project is estimated to be in excess&#13;
of 36% on 86% of total project costs (excluding physical and price contingencies). The evaluation of&#13;
each investment component, road and rail is discussed separately below.&#13;
2.    Road Sub-Component: The economic benefits of this sub-component were evaluated with the&#13;
World Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM-III), for the sections of both the main&#13;
roads and the secondary roads where maintenance and rehabilitation will be financed by the project.&#13;
3.    The road sub-component includes three items: (i) pothole fixing; (ii) road clearing and drainage&#13;
rehabilitation; and (iii) selected bridge rehabilitation. Item (ii) is necessary to increase the life-time of&#13;
the pothole fixing program. Provided that item (ii) is carried out, the pothole fixing program would have&#13;
a life period of about 3 years on the main roads, and of about 5 years for the secondary roads (given the&#13;
lower traffic levels and the fact that major rehabilitation works will be carried out on the main network&#13;
as a priority). Investments for the selected bridge rehabilitation (item (iii)) are also needed to keep&#13;
bridges on the main roads open.&#13;
4.    Items (ii) and (iii) are necessary to obtain the full benefits of the project sub-component, and their&#13;
costs were included as investment costs in the economic evaluation. Other project sub-component costs&#13;
related to technical assistance, office technology and logistical support were also included as investment&#13;
costs for the purpose of the economic evaluation.&#13;
5.    On average, based on a visual inspection, the road surface of the main road sections under the&#13;
project was estimated to have an International Roughness Index (IRI) of about 6.5, with 50% of the&#13;
surface deteriorated, mainly with cracks. Average traffic on these road sections was estimated at 1,000&#13;
vehicles per day (vpd). Evaluation of the secondary road sections indicated that their IRI was at about&#13;
7.0, with 60% of the surface deteriorated. Average traffic on the secondary roads was estimated at about&#13;
230 vpd. Finally, the conservative assumption that traffic would not grow by more than 2% per year&#13;
was made. See the Project File Documents (listed in Annex 19) for more details on the assumptions used.&#13;
6.    Project benefits for the main road sections would generate a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$&#13;
1.67 million (with a discount rate of 10%), for an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 40%. For the&#13;
secondary road sections, the project would induce a NPV of US$2.32 million, for an ERR of 50%.&#13;
Table I summarizes the economic evaluation of both road sub-components.&#13;
7.    Rail Sub-Component: The benefits and cost-savings linked to the rail sub-component of the&#13;
project were estimated on the basis of: (i) decreases in railway operations unit costs, compared to not&#13;
carrying out the project; and (ii) estimates of the benefits from additional traffic generated by the project,&#13;
compared to not carrying out the project. Project sub-component costs factored in the economic&#13;
evaluation include physical investments as well as technical assistance, office technology and logistical&#13;
support provided to the railway department. Table 11 summarizes the main assumptions and the&#13;
economic evaluation of the sub-component. See the Project File Documents (listed in Annex 19) for&#13;
detailed assumptions and projections.&#13;

8.     Sensitivity Analysis: A sensitivity analysis has been performed (see Table III) for: (a) traffic&#13;
variations of + 5 %, reflecting the awareness that a sharper contraction or sudden increases in economic&#13;
activity are not likely in the near future in Georgia; (b) Changes of + 20% in project costs, which could&#13;
result from the fact that this is a first project in the sector in Georgia and there is no prior experience&#13;
with competitive bidding systems; and (c) Changes in operating costs of + 20% resulting from imperfect&#13;
knowledge of operating costs parameters such as the economic wage rate, equipment and maintenance&#13;
real costs and the valuation of foreign exchange. The results indicate a robust project with a significant&#13;
return on investments under likely scenarios, as follows: (i) a slight sensitivity to traffic levels, a&#13;
reduction of about 2% in the ERR would result from traffic levels 5 % lower than estimated;  (ii) a&#13;
damped sensitivity to project costs, a 20% increase in project costs would have a proportionally smaUller&#13;
impact on the ERR, which would decrease by about 17%; and (iii) the variation in the ERR to changes&#13;
in operating costs estimates are similar in magnitude and opposite in sign to the effects of project cost&#13;
changes and will tend to offset each other.&#13;
9.     The estimation of project costs in an economy in transition such as Georgia poses some&#13;
difficulties which come in part from remaining price distortions, less than perfect market operations and&#13;
incomplete information on the level of economic activity. The effects of these difficulties have been&#13;
reduced by means of: (i) a systematic use of US dollar based estimates at a time of improved fiscal&#13;
management and exchange rate stability, and (ii) use of unit costs for project cost estimates following the&#13;
experience in other countries in the region. As a result, adjustments in key parameters such as the wage&#13;
rate, which are likely to occur over the next few years, are not expected to have an extreme impact on&#13;
actual project costs to be observed during project implementation.&#13;
10.    Sumnnary:  The weighted Economic Rate of Return for the Investment Component (inclusive&#13;
of technical assistance), representing 86% of project costs, will be in excess of 36%, with a Net Present&#13;
Value discounted at 10% of US$ 12 million (see Table IV).&#13;

GEORGIA&#13;
Transport Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Highway Concern - Technical Assistance&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Until 1990/91, the Highway Concern was responsible for the design and management of&#13;
construction and maintenance of the principal road network in Georgia. Since 1991, road construction&#13;
and maintenance have stopped, as the result of a lack of funds. The staff, badly paid or not paid at all,&#13;
goes occasionally to work in the hope of an unlikely resumption of activities. The civil works equipment&#13;
pool, abandoned and/or plundered, is reduced to a few machines which could still be of use if repaired.&#13;
2.    The main objective of the Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP) in the road sector is to stop the&#13;
degradation of the principal road network, by restoring drainage works and by carrying out basic road&#13;
repairs and refurbishing damaged bridges. The works will be performed under national competitive&#13;
bidding, the Highway Concern acting as the contracting authority.&#13;
3.    The central services of the Concern do not have the experience of civil works contract preparation&#13;
and management. Up to now, the private sector has not operated in this technical field. The independent&#13;
field units of the Concern, which carried out road maintenance and construction works until 1991, are&#13;
well structured. They were financially autonomous, and the operating credits, except for the staff directly&#13;
paid by the Government, were transferred to bank accounts managed by these units. These units would&#13;
be therefore able to operate independently if eligible to bid.&#13;
4.    In the past, the field units had at their disposal overabundant staff and equipment, and their&#13;
managers were not concerned about optimizing their costs and revenues. With the forthcoming market&#13;
liberalization and competitive bidding, those managers will be forced to improve efficiency.&#13;
5.    The technologies which were employed for road construction or maintenance were out of date,&#13;
and materials were badly used and sometimes of poor quality (especially the bitumen and granulates).&#13;
There exists a need to upgrade costly and obsolete methods of road construction and maintenance, and&#13;
improve the quality of works. There are also issues to be addressed in the field of winter viability of&#13;
mountain roads, which are under snow-fall during several months of the year.&#13;
Diagnosis&#13;
6.    Central Services of the Concern. The Highway Concern would be the executing agency of road&#13;
civil works contracts. It has skilled staff with field experience in the road sector. Moreover, it has a&#13;
sound knowledge of the abilities of the field units, which are likely to bid for civil works contracts. On&#13;
the other hand, they have neither the experience of preparing and managing contracts for works or goods,&#13;
nor the ability to control the execution of works by the private sector. In the context of market&#13;
liberalization, the creation of both a Contract Transactions Department and a Works Supervision&#13;
Department by the Highway Concern is the very first and necessary step to be implemented. The Concern&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 19&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
will also be responsible for managing the Road Fund revenues. These revenues will be allocated to cover&#13;
the operating expenses of central services and to finance road maintenance. The Concern will also have&#13;
to create a Financial Department to undertake this responsibility.&#13;
7.     Field Units. Those units eligible to bid may be able to carry out the road maintenance works&#13;
included in the TRP. Their staff is skilled with extensive field knowledge. These units and their technical&#13;
facilities and equipment are distributed all over the country. Although these units have already carried&#13;
out many works, this has been done without any constraints, be it time, equipment or money. They have&#13;
to adapt to management practices in a competitive environment.&#13;
8.     Equipment Department. This department needs to be eliminated. The Concern will cease to&#13;
perform works by force account. Today, the situation amounts to a de-facto privatization, as maintenance&#13;
staff has appropriated equipment still working. This situation can help the realization of the project, as&#13;
the holders of the equipment may offer their services to enterprises or field units with civil works&#13;
contracts. However, the legal status of this ownership will have to be clarified, and costs of spare parts&#13;
financed under the project will be fully recovered by the Highway Concern.&#13;
9.     Current Technologv. The basic road maintenance techniques are neither efficient nor economical.&#13;
Two serious deficiencies must be underlined: (i) the local materials, however abundant and of good&#13;
quality, are poorly used, leading to important deformations of roads soon thereafter; and (ii) the imported&#13;
materials, such as the hydrocarbonated and hydraulic binders, seem to be of uneven quality. For future&#13;
procurement, specifications must be established for the import of these products. A laboratory does exist&#13;
within the Concern, but it carries out "scientific research" and is totally disconnected from daily&#13;
operations. Pure bitumen is used as hydrocarbonated binder, whereas it is well known in Western-&#13;
European countries that it is more efficient and less expensive to use an emulsion of bitumen and other&#13;
products, among them water. Therefore, it is necessary: a) to upgrade construction techniques; b) to train&#13;
both controllers and contractors; and c) to provide through the competitive process incentives to&#13;
contractors to acquire more efficient equipment.&#13;
Recommendations&#13;
10.    The success of the TRP in the road sector will require a technical assistance to the central services&#13;
of the Concern and to the field units on the following topics:&#13;
a) Public sector:&#13;
(i) Creation of a Financial Department, of a Contract Transactions Department, and of&#13;
a Works Supervision Department;&#13;
(ii) provision of technical assistance in order to upgrade the costly and obsolete methods&#13;
of road maintenance and construction, and improve the quality of works.&#13;
b) Private sector:&#13;
(i) organization of construction sites and programming of works;&#13;
(ii) restructuring of construction enterprises, and acquisition of new equipment;&#13;
(iii) management of construction enterprises;&#13;
(iv) bid preparation.&#13;

11.    Financial Department. Within the Concern a department is already in charge of collecting the tax&#13;
on the turnover of private enterprises. These tax revenues are allocated to operating expenses of the&#13;
central services. This department would need to be developed into a full Financial Department to manage&#13;
the collection, allocation, and disbursement of road user charge proceeds.&#13;
12.   Contract Transactions Department. As a result of preparation work for TRP, managers are just&#13;
beginning to realize how complex bidding procedures are, and how useful external help for this new&#13;
activity can be. There is a need for further cooperation and assistance in implementing this function. This&#13;
department should be able to program and manage all contracts in the future. Its functions will include&#13;
invitations to bids, contracts preparation and award, and follow-up of disbursements.&#13;
13.   Works Supervision Department. A Works Supervision Department supposedly exists within the&#13;
Concern, in the form of a 15- to 20-man team based in Tbilisi and Khashuri. This department seems to&#13;
be an internal audit department. Nonetheless it could be used as a starting point for the implementation&#13;
of a future Works Supervision Department, which would certify executed works and their quality.&#13;
14.   Techniques and Materials. The central services of the Concern must be assisted in making known&#13;
and widely available more efficient and costs-saving technologies.&#13;
Private Sector&#13;
15.   Organization and Progranuning of Works. The construction enterprises will need to be assisted&#13;
on operations-related topics, such as civil works scheduling and organization, management of resources,&#13;
selection of appropriate equipment, and cost estimation.&#13;
16.    Restructuring and Manal2ement of Enterprises. The objective is to privatize the road construction&#13;
and maintenance units of the Concern, thus enhancing profitability and quality awareness. The staff of&#13;
these units will therefore need to learn how to operate competitively on a cost-effective basis, and costs&#13;
control and analysis techniques will need to be introduced. Considering the importance of commercial&#13;
skills and traditions in the Georgian culture, Georgian people can be expected to succeed in this&#13;
transformation, provided foreign experts support them. Moreover, the equipment pools of these&#13;
enterprises will need to be rationalized, and road construction and maintenance techniques chosen in a&#13;
cost-effective way.&#13;
17.    Bid Preparation. The private sector does not operate in the civil works field, and skills&#13;
development is needed for managers of construction enterprises in bid  preparation, contracts&#13;
administration, and costs analysis.&#13;

Technical assistance&#13;
18.    Project preparation is underway, with works due to begin at the end of March 1996. Therefore,&#13;
there is no time for extended training of central services and field units staff on general theoretical&#13;
principles and on modern technologies. Hands-on training within the concerned departments would be&#13;
by far the more effective. A successful implementation of the TRP will require training advisers for the&#13;
concerned central services and enterprises. Those advisers should be experts and specialists on the above-&#13;
mentioned topics. As the only foreign language which is spoken in Georgia is Russian, and as a few&#13;
foreign western experts speak this language, communication will be the core of the problem. There are&#13;
within the Concern some translators able to translate English technical papers, but interpreters will be&#13;
needed.&#13;
The table below describes the training advisers who will be needed for the technica' assistance program.&#13;

            The Transport Rehabilitation Project,
            which is the first transport sector investment project in
            Georgia, has the following objectives: 1) to support policy
            reform in the transport sector and restructure its
            institutions to operate in a market economy; and 2) to
            repair and maintain some of the most critical elements of
            the transport system. The project has two main components:
            a) an institution building component, which includes policy
            reform, support to the transport reform and rehabilitation
            center, and consultant services to modal agencies and
            operational units; and b) an investment component comprising
            a road maintenance program and a railway sub-component.
