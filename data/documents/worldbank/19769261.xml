            Kenya economic update : take off delayed? -
            Kenya's economy facing headwinds in 2014 with a special
            focus on delivering primary health care services
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This is the tenth edition of the Kenya
            Economic Update. The special focus of this update identifies
            some of the challenges facing Kenya's health system. It
            examines how reforms have already improved primary care and
            suggests how Kenya can build on its devolved system of
            delivering primary health services to achieve the
            government' s goal of providing universal health
            coverage. Under Kenya's new devolved system of
            government, responsibility for delivering health care
            services lies with county governments. A series of actions
            on their part could improve health outcomes, increase the
            efficiency and effectiveness of the system, and move Kenya
            toward its goal of achieving universal health coverage. The
            report has three main messages: First, the economy remains
            strong despite the headwinds it faces in 2014. Kenya's
            record of maintaining macroeconomic stability and adhering
            to credible policies has underpinned its growth in the
            past;staying this course will help Kenyaweather the domestic
            shocks it faces, allowing it to grow at an annual rate of
            4.7 percent in 2014 and 2015. Second, addressing the fiscal
            pressures emerging from fiscal expansion is a priority.
            Given the reduction in fiscal buffers and the fiscal risks
            linked to the wage bill and devolution, efficiency gains
            needs to be achieved. Additional spending should be pursued
            only if they are necessary and careful attention is given to
            sustainability. Third, Kenya's health outcomes are not
            commensurate with its aspirations of achieving middle income
            status. More needs to be done to improve these outcomes.
            Global evidence indicates that the best way to improve
            health outcomes is to improve primary health care. Doing so
            involves reallocating some of the health budget away from
            curative care towards preventive and promotive care.
