            Scaling up rural sanitation : improved
            sanitation can make children taller and smarter in Rural Tanzania
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In Tanzania, 87.8 percent of households
            do not have access to improved sanitation, such as a latrine
            or a toilet that separates human feces from human contact.
            The situation is worse in rural areas, where 92.5 percent of
            households do not have improved sanitation. Among those
            without sanitation, 5.6 million individuals defecate in the
            open. Unfortunately, the situation is getting worse, not
            better. In 2012, more people in rural Tanzania were
            defecating in the open than in 2000. In those same areas, 45
            percent of children under five were found to be stunted in
            2010. Nutrition interventions alone can only reduce stunting
            by 36 percent and mortality by 25 percent. Other
            interventions are needed to make up the rest of the height
            difference. Recent research has shown that differences in
            open defecation can explain up to 54 percent of the
            variation in average child height in some developing
            countries and more than 60 percent if density of open
            defecation is considered. This analysis was conducted to
            determine if a lack of improved sanitation can similarly
            explain the large amount of stunting in Tanzania. This brief
            discusses an analysis conducted by WSP to examine the link
            between sanitation and stunting in Tanzania.
