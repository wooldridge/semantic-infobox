The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor partnership administered&#13;
by the World Bank to support poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and&#13;
sustainable access to water and sanitation services.&#13;
&amp;#12;The author would like to thank Jacqueline Devine for her guidance and inputs. Thanks also to&#13;
Emily Christensen Rand, Susanna Smets, Jane Bevan, Eduardo Perez, and James Dumpert for&#13;
their thoughtful comments and review.&#13;
WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is working with governments and the local private sector&#13;
to develop the knowledge needed to scale up rural sanitation for the poor. The programmatic&#13;
approach combines Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), behavior change communication,&#13;
and sanitation marketing to generate sanitation demand and build up the supply of sanitation&#13;
products and services at scale. In addition, WSP works with local and national governments&#13;
and the local private sector to strengthen the enabling environmentâ&#128;&#148;including institutional,&#13;
regulatory, ï¬&#129;nancial, service-delivery, and monitoring capacitiesâ&#128;&#148;to achieve change that is&#13;
sustainable. Starting in India, Indonesia, and Tanzania in 2006, Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is&#13;
currently being implemented in more than a dozen countries. For more information, please visit&#13;

This Working Paper is one in a series of knowledge products designed to showcase project&#13;
ï¬&#129;ndings, assessments, and lessons learned through WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Scaling Up Rural Sanitation&#13;
initiatives. This paper is conceived as a work in progress to encourage the exchange of&#13;
ideas about development issues. For more information please email Kathryn Oâ&#128;&#153;Connell at&#13;

Given differences in coverage between wealthier and                           such as improved social status and pride associated with&#13;

   BOX 1: SANIFOAM FRAMEWORK&#13;
   The SaniFOAM framework uses a set of behavioral             behavior, and includes health knowledge, awareness&#13;
   determinants organized under the domains of oppor-          of different latrine types and price, perceived social&#13;
   tunity, ability, and motivationâ&#128;&#148;factors with founda-        support for latrine acquisition and use, household&#13;
   tions in the disciplines of consumer behavior, public       roles and decisions regarding major expenditures,&#13;
   health, health psychology marketing, advertising, and       and perceived affordability of latrines. Motivation is&#13;

        â&#128;¢ Different survey methodologies and study instruments were used in the formative research studies, mak-&#13;
          ing comparison between countries more challenging.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Some research topics were explored in detail in some studies and not covered in others.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ The deï¬&#129;nition of ownership of different latrine types varied by study. For example, in East Java, respon-&#13;
          dents were categorized as improved or unimproved latrine owners, sharers, or open defecators; whereas&#13;
          in Cambodia, respondents were classiï¬&#129;ed by latrine ownership versus no ownership.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ The review is based on summary reports, not the original data. Hence, ï¬&#129;ndings have been ï¬&#129;ltered and&#13;
          interpreted by the authors of the reports. In particular, qualitative research has been translated, which may&#13;
          have led to lost insight or bias.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Tables of frequencies or means were commonly presented in reports, but statistical comparisons between&#13;
          target groups were rarer.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Although many of the surveys used Likert scales to address attitudes toward different concepts, the data&#13;
          were not analyzed in a consistent manner, making interpretations more challenging.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Not all of the studies used the SaniFOAM framework as a means to structure the survey questionnaires or&#13;
          present ï¬&#129;ndings. Some of the reports retroï¬&#129;tted results to the framework, given that the studies predated&#13;
          the SaniFOAM framework.&#13;

       â&#128;¢ privacy&#13;
       â&#128;¢ cleanliness and being easy to clean&#13;

       â&#128;¢ affordability&#13;
       â&#128;¢ ease of construction&#13;
&#13;
   For example, â&#128;&#156;privacyâ&#128;&#157; is cited as an ideal attribute by 46 percent of households in Bihar, 67 percent in Rajasthan,&#13;
   and 80 percent in Meghalaya. Cleanliness is cited as the most important attribute in Kenya.&#13;

       Some people may have a toilet, but are not used to going to&#13;
       the toilet. It depends with how a person was brought up. If                In certain circumstances (such as when traveling) or for cer-&#13;

    Open defecation is described as traditional, habitual, and                    norms may also further influence open defecation, such as&#13;
    part of oneâ&#128;&#153;s daily routine, and these social norms are also                  the belief that females and male in-laws should not share&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   BOX 4: DO HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCURATE PRICE PERCEPTIONS OF LATRINES?&#13;
   The perception of the price of a latrine varies because open defecators have, in some cases, never owned, built,&#13;
   or even used a latrine, and owners of unimproved latrines have little experience with upgrading their facilities,&#13;
   although they might have looked at options for latrine upgrades. Notably, open defecators perceive latrines as&#13;
   much more expensive than do households that own latrines, but may own household items that cost as much as&#13;
   a latrine. For example, in Kenya, 90 percent of households own a radio, which costs approximately the same as&#13;
   building a latrine (WSP et al. 2013, 2).&#13;
&#13;
   Generally, people are unaware of a range of affordable latrine options. Ensuring that households have accurate&#13;
   perceptions of costs associated with latrine purchases and upgrades may help to address the perceived afford-&#13;
   ability barrier.&#13;

For unimproved latrine owners, the high cost of materials                     fluctuation of income, lack of savings, lack of financing and&#13;
and labor, coupled with lack of savings and access to credit,                 limited credit options for home improvement, and actual&#13;
prevents improvements from being made. Given that pit                         versus perceived costs of building a latrine.&#13;
latrines are notably lacking in durability, there is also need&#13;
for repeated financial investments just to maintain or re-&#13;
build them.&#13;

                                      Improved social status was a particularly important driver to motivate open defecators to acquire latrines.&#13;

   BOX 5: THE ROLE OF IMPORTANT FAMILY EVENTS AS A MEANS TO RAISE LATRINE PRIORITY&#13;
   Events such as a wedding, welcoming guests, and in-laws joining families may raise the priority of a home latrine&#13;
   above other demands on household resources. For example, in Bihar, latrine owners are more likely to agree that&#13;
   latrines are constructed when visiting children refuse to defecate in the open. Other events include sudden sick-&#13;
   ness, hosting an important social gathering, or an extended visit from a relative from the city or abroad. It may be&#13;
   that these events raise priority of latrines above other household demands and serve to promote a move up the&#13;
   sanitation ladder.&#13;

   Temporal and Seasonal Factors&#13;
   Open defecation may be more frequent during certain times of the year:&#13;
     â&#128;¢ At night, in cases where latrines are located further from the household and security is a concern or to&#13;
        allow for more privacy.&#13;

   Open defecation or latrine acquisition may vary by season, as seen in these examples:&#13;
     â&#128;¢ In Sub-Saharan Africa countries, open defecation is more commonly practiced during the rainy season,&#13;
        as latrines are cited as overfull, washed away, or collapsed. Heavy rains prevent latrines from being built,&#13;
        rebuilt, or repaired.&#13;
     â&#128;¢ During the dry season in East Java, rivers dry up and no longer provide an option to allow feces to ï¬&#130;oat&#13;
        away, so alternatives to open defecation are sought.&#13;
&#13;
   Land Access and Tenure&#13;
   Sufï¬&#129;cient access to land and space to build latrines is noted as an important driver. In situations where latrines&#13;
   are overfull or have collapsed, it is impracticable or impossible to construct another latrine given insufï¬&#129;cient land&#13;
   space. Some examples include:&#13;
       â&#128;¢ In Meghalaya and East Java, 22 percent of open defecators report that they lack space to build a latrine.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ In East Java, many report insufï¬&#129;cient land to make improvements, such as space for a septic tank.&#13;
&#13;
   Not owning oneâ&#128;&#153;s house or land can also act as a disincentive to construct a latrine, as mentioned by open&#13;
   defecators:&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Meghalaya (16 percent)&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Bihar (15 percent)&#13;
&#13;
   Soil Proï¬&#129;le&#13;
   Soil proï¬&#129;les, such as rocky or steep landscapes, pose a challenge to building latrines, as most commonly noted&#13;
   in East African countries and East Java. In some instances, water is too close to the surface, making it impossible&#13;
   to dig sufï¬&#129;ciently deep pits. In cases where latrines have collapsed or are no longer functioning, households often&#13;
   report that they do not have the ability to rebuild latrines, due to ï¬&#130;ooding of land and soil quality, as illustrated by&#13;
   this participant from an in-depth interview:&#13;
&#13;
       In this center we have one problem. We cannot dig pits because of the rocks we have here. You can only dig&#13;
       up to four feet and then you reach the rocks. If you donâ&#128;&#153;t plan properly here you cannot dig a pit of 25 feet.&#13;

        Access to Water Sources&#13;
        A sufï¬&#129;cient water supply for ï¬&#130;ushing away waste and latrine cleaning is seen is an integral part of the latrine&#13;
        decision-making process, and will also inï¬&#130;uence the type of latrine built. Scarce water supply, along with the&#13;
        perception that latrines consume a lot of water, can pose a barrier to building a latrine and prevent usage. For&#13;
        example, in Rajasthan, one in four households cited lack of water as a reason for open defecation. In contrast,&#13;
        in some areas where water supply is not an issue, having a river or water stream nearby is seen as an easy and&#13;
        inexpensive means to dispose of waste, such as in East Java (upper photo) and Peru (lower photo). Photo credit:&#13;

The review identiï¬&#129;ed several other factors, including                                        meant or understood. Hygiene may be in reference to a la-&#13;

behaviors, thus limiting the strength of the conclusions that                                importance of health and hygiene as a motivational concept&#13;
can be made. This may be due to the different research ob-                                   (and what this actually means to latrine owners and open&#13;

                                                                                             were explored in study questionnaires, findings were not&#13;
In some instances, conclusions were difficult to draw given                                  presented in reports, making it challenging to conclude the&#13;

found for knowledge (see Figure 9). Knowledge questions                                      across countries. However, in the reports where these con-&#13;

        BOX 7: THE INFLUENCE OF SANCTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT, BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES, AND VALUES&#13;
        ON RURAL SANITATION BEHAVIORS&#13;
        Sanctions and Enforcement&#13;
        In certain situations, sanitation behaviors may be inï¬&#130;uenced by law enforcement and other regulations as men-&#13;
        tioned in Tanzania, and the three Indian states. For example,&#13;
            â&#128;¢ In Tanzania, there is pressure from district ofï¬&#129;cials to replace latrines that are full.&#13;
            â&#128;¢ In Meghalaya, one of the main reasons for building a latrine is stringent village rules.&#13;
            â&#128;¢ In Bihar, latrine owners are more likely to agree that sanctions are in place and that there are rules and&#13;
               penalties to stop open defecation.&#13;
&#13;
        Beliefs and Attitudes&#13;
        There exist a number of beliefs and attitudes toward open defecation that serve to deter the extent to which feces&#13;
        are perceived as harmful to the environment and the concept of human waste as a source of pollution, but only&#13;
        found as relevant in Bihar, East Java and Kenya. For example,&#13;
            â&#128;¢ In Bihar, farmers believe that feces are beneï¬&#129;cial for farming, as it will increase fertility of the land and im-&#13;
               prove and increase crop production.&#13;
            â&#128;¢ In East Java, respondents discuss how open defecation into a river is not harmful, given there is the belief&#13;
               that ï¬&#129;sh eat their waste or that feces can serve as fertilizer.&#13;
&#13;
        These beliefs are more salient among open defecators, and may serve as psychological refuges that help to jus-&#13;
        tify their behavior.&#13;
&#13;
        Values&#13;
        Only a few of the reports cite the importance of values: Peru, East Java, and Tanzania. In these countries, latrine&#13;
        ownership is associated with a number of positive family values: being clean, being health conscious, and being&#13;
        good parents and welcoming hosts. For example:&#13;
           â&#128;¢ In Peru and East Java, having a sanitation facility at home represents modernity and progress.&#13;
           â&#128;¢ In Tanzania, â&#128;&#156;modernityâ&#128;&#157; is the most common reason for households to improve existing latrine.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     final decision to rest with the male head of the household,                   (see Figure 10), open defecators describe their behavior as&#13;
     there is country and regional variance, which makes gener-                    â&#128;&#156;easyâ&#128;&#157; and practical. They report that if it is late at night or&#13;
     alizing results challenging. For example, in Meghalaya,                       raining heavily, they use flying toilets so there is no need to&#13;
     which is a matriarchal society, women have an important                       leave their household compound. The notion of conve-&#13;
     role in the decision-making process.                                          nience may be related to a number of factors, such as&#13;
                                                                                   whether or not there are open defecation sites allocated for&#13;
     Convenience is highlighted as both a barrier and a motiva-                    this behavior, how much available space and privacy there is&#13;
     tor to adopting better sanitation practices. Although latrine                 to defecate when one needs to, and the proximity of oneâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     owners cite convenience as an advantage to owning a latrine                   homestead to others.&#13;

    BOX 8: REGIONAL VARIATIONS REGARDING THE RELEVANCE OF DIFFERENT SANIFOAM FACTORS&#13;
   Drivers: Perceptions that latrines provide safety and security&#13;
   The concept of safety and security is both a motivator and a deterrent for improved sanitation, and there are dif-&#13;
   ferences between countries and regions in terms of where open-defecation behavior takes place and the type of&#13;
   latrine.&#13;
&#13;
   For example, as a motivator for latrine acquisition:&#13;
      â&#128;¢ There is fear of being dragged away by strong currents, especially for children, or that people can be bitten&#13;
         or attacked by wild animals. It is also perceived as dangerous when the ground is muddy.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ A main reason for building a latrine is â&#128;&#156;improved security for women and children,â&#128;&#157; as mentioned by 69&#13;
         percent of latrine owners in Rajasthan, 63 percent in Bihar, and 50 percent in Meghalaya.&#13;
&#13;
   For example, as a barrier to latrine acquisition and use:&#13;
      â&#128;¢ In Kenya, households report that they are afraid to use the latrine because of the distance/proximity of the&#13;
         latrine to their house, and would rather use ï¬&#130;ying toilets at nighttime. There is a fear that people will be&#13;
         bitten or attacked by wild animals.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Pit latrines are considered dangerous and in poor condition, especially after rains. Consequently, people&#13;
         report that they would prefer to defecate in the open rather than risk falling into a sinking hole or a latrine&#13;
         collapsing.&#13;
&#13;
   The notion of latrines as being unsafe is in relation to pit latrines. A key trigger to upgrading latrines is around the&#13;
   notion that â&#128;&#156;improved latrinesâ&#128;&#157; are durable and safe. Improved safety is also described as one of the most com-&#13;
   mon reasons for improving an existing latrine. As such, the conï¬&#130;icting information regarding the role of safety in&#13;
   latrine adoption may be due to perceptions regarding the type of latrine being referenced by research participants.&#13;

     Finally, some other concepts emerged from the review,                                        that in some cases, open defecators may be happy enough&#13;
     including satisfaction. The assumption is that the greater                                   with their current practices (see Figure 11). Therefore,&#13;
     the degree of dissatisfaction, the higher the likelihood                                     the relationship between satisfaction and an individualâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     that a respondent will move up the sanitation ladder.                                        position on the sanitation ladder is somewhat unclear,&#13;
     However, levels of satisfaction with current defecation                                      although owners of improved latrines are clearly the&#13;
     practices vary by region and behavior group and suggest                                      most satisfied.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   BOX 9: EXAMPLES OF PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FROM THE REVIEW&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Open defecation is a common behavior and is sustained through local cultural norms. According to the&#13;
          SaniFOAM framework, it is a social norm that is traditional and practiced since childhood, and in some&#13;
          regions, such as in India and East Java, further fostered by designated sites allocated for open defecation.&#13;
          Although changing actual normal practice may be a long and slow process, a ï¬&#129;rst step may be changing&#13;
          perceived norms. For example, regularly portraying latrine usage in mass media, in TV ads, or on enter-&#13;
          tainment shows can create the impression of normality. Campaigns should endeavor to give high visibility&#13;
          to latrine usage as a social norm by creating the illusion that â&#128;&#156;everyoneâ&#128;&#153;s doing it,â&#128;&#157; complementing efforts&#13;
          through Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), and other triggering approaches.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ There is a clear association between oneâ&#128;&#153;s position on the sanitation ladder and socioeconomic status.&#13;
          Wealthier people are more likely to own and use improved latrines. However, many believe that latrines are&#13;
          too expensive to purchase and install. Improving knowledge around the actual cost of latrines and com-&#13;
          paring the costs with other household items can serve to encourage latrine acquisition.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Similarly, messages around the affordability of latrines should be coupled with descriptions about positive&#13;
          latrine attributes that stress that improved latrines are safe, durable, and hygienic. This can also help to&#13;
          encourage use and acquisition.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Events such as a wedding or welcoming guests may raise the priority of a home latrine above other de-&#13;
          mands on household resources, and this can serve to promote latrine acquisition. As such, promoting&#13;
          latrine purchases or improvements prior to large annual holidays that involve visits from family members&#13;
          from other parts of the country, or other large social gatherings or ceremonies (such as religious festivals&#13;
          or weddings), may serve to promote latrine acquisition prior to these events. This could also be comple-&#13;
          mented with messaging that presents latrine-owning families as welcoming and good hosts.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Not owning oneâ&#128;&#153;s house or land can also act as a disincentive to construct a latrine. In areas where renting&#13;
          is more common, landlords may be considered as a target population for promoting latrines. Demand-&#13;
          creation strategies could stress the value that latrine ownership could add to their property.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Sociodemographic and other environmental characteristics, such as access to water, perceptions of soil&#13;
          quality, and seasonal and temporal factors, provide important contextual information for sanitation be-&#13;
          haviors. Changing physical factors on a large scale, such as the availability of water, requires long-term&#13;
          sustained investment, which is typically beyond the ability of a sanitation campaign to deliver. However,&#13;
          given variations between countries and regions, these factors should be noted as a means to help tailor&#13;
          and target behavior change interventions.&#13;

            What influences open defecation and latrine
            ownership in rural households? : findings from a global review
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            As part of its scaling up rural
            sanitation and domestic private sector participation
            programs, the water and sanitation program (WSP) of the
            World Bank has been commissioning formative research studies
            among households. WSP has utilized a conceptual framework,
            called sanitation focus, opportunity, ability, motivation
            (Sani- FOAM), to help program managers and implementers
            analyze sanitation behaviors to inform effective sanitation
            programs. Three specific sanitation behaviors are covered in
            the review: open defecation, acquisition of toilets, and
            improvement of latrines. This review collects the results
            from formative quantitative and qualitative research reports
            and presentations from eight countries: Cambodia, India
            (Rajasthan, Meghalaya, and Bihar), Indonesia (East Java),
            Kenya, Malawi, Peru, Tanzania, and Uganda. Studies were
            conducted from 2006 until 2012. The studies reviewed used a
            variety of methods, including focus group discussions,
            in-depth interviews, and structured interviews using
            questionnaires. The review followed standard qualitative
            methodologies of thematic ordering and interpretation to
            identify factors that can positively or negatively influence
            the behaviors of interest. Findings presented in this report
            illustrate themes that were consistently found across
            regions and countries. The most salient factors influencing
            rural sanitation behaviors that emerged from the review
            include access to and availability of functioning latrines,
            sanitation products, and services; latrine product
            attributes (for example, perceptions of cleanliness and
            durability); social norms around open defecation;
            perceptions of latrine affordability; self-efficacy to build
            latrines; and competing priorities for other household
            items. The review also identified a number of emotional,
            social, and physical drivers. These include shame and
            embarrassment associated with open defecation, as well as
            perceptions of improved social status, privacy, and
            convenience associated with latrine ownership and use.
