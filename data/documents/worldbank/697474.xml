GAS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Pro-ect Summary&#13;
Borrower:         People's Republic of Bangladesh&#13;
Beneficiaries:    Gas Transmission company Limited (GTCL), Sylhet Gas Fields&#13;
Limited (SGFL), and Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Minerals&#13;
Corporation (Petrobangla)&#13;
Amount:           SDR 83.4 million (US$ 120.8 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:            Standard, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Onlendincr Terms: The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) would onlend the proceeds&#13;
of the credit to GTCL, SGFL and Petrobangla at an interest&#13;
rate of 8% per annum, repayable over 15 years, including 5&#13;
years of grace. The beneficiaries would bear the foreign&#13;
exchange risk.&#13;
Proiect&#13;
Description:      The principal objectives of the project are to help&#13;
alleviate gas supply shortages and support further reforms&#13;
to improve overall gas sector management. The project would&#13;
also assist the sector entities in their institutional&#13;
development. The project would finance: (a) a 58 km, 30-&#13;
inch diameter gas transmission pipeline from Ashuganj to&#13;
Bakhrabad; (b) SCADA and telecommunication facilities for&#13;
the gas trunkline from Kailashtilla to Chittagong; (c) three&#13;
production wells at the Rashidpur gas field; (d) a gas&#13;
processing plant for the above wells; and (e) technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
Benefits&#13;
and Risks:        Benefits would include increased availability and improved&#13;
reliability of gas supply, and resource savings from&#13;
substitution of gas for imported alternative fuels. The&#13;
institutional support would improve sector entities'&#13;
operational efficiency and safety. The project would also&#13;
contribute toward mitigating the impact of energy use on the&#13;
quality of the environment. The project would not pose any&#13;
special technical risks. The potential risks for the&#13;
project are delays in procurement and shortfalls in the&#13;
beneficiaries' project management capacity. To minimize&#13;
these risks, advance procurement actions have been&#13;
initiated, and adequate technical assistance is provided to&#13;
assist in the implementation and construction supervision of&#13;
project works. To keep the overall project on track, GOB&#13;
would carry out a joint annual review with IDA of project&#13;
progress as well as GOB's progress in carrying out further&#13;
reforms in the gas sector.&#13;

GAS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL RZPORT&#13;
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. Enerza R-sources&#13;
1.1       Bangladesh's indigenous energy resources consist of substantial&#13;
reserves of relatively low cost natural gas, limited hydroelectric power&#13;
potential and a large base of traditional fuels in the form of crop residues,&#13;
animal dung and fuelwood. About 55% of the country's overall energy supply is&#13;
based on traditional fuels, with the balance being met by natural gas (24%),&#13;
imported oil and coal (19%), and hydroelectricity (2%). The potential of&#13;
economically recoverable oil and coal resources has yet to be determined.&#13;
1.2       Natural Gas.  Natural gas is Bangladesh's most important source of&#13;
commercial energy. During the last two decades, the gas sector has undergone&#13;
major expansion. Natural gas output increased from 11.5 billion cubic feet&#13;
(BCF) in FY72 to 210 BCF in FY93, and now accounts for about 60% of the&#13;
country's commercial energy supply. Current estimates of gas reserves in&#13;
place are about 21 trillion cubic feet (TCF), of which about 12.4 TCF are&#13;
considered as recoverable. The known gas fields also contain a substantial&#13;
quantity of condensates; under conventional separation systems, about 65&#13;
million barrels of condensates could be recovered in association with gas&#13;
production. Prospects for proving up new gas reserves in the numerous known&#13;
field extensions as well as in the new exploration blocks are very good with&#13;
the implementation of a more intensified field appraisal program in the near&#13;
term and a comprehensive exploration program in the longer term.&#13;
1.3       Oil.  Apart from the discovery of a limited quantity of oil in the&#13;
Sylhet gas field area, exploration carried out thus far has not found any&#13;
significant accumulation of oil. Recognizing that Bangladesh lacks the&#13;
capital and technology required to competently explore and develop its&#13;
hydrocarbon endowment, and encouraged by the visible successes of other&#13;
countries in attracting international private participation in their&#13;
petroleum/gas sectors, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) announced in July&#13;
1993 a new petroleum policy to seek participation of international oil&#13;
companies (IOCs) in hydrocarbon exploration and production through production&#13;
sharing contracts (PSCs). To date, four PSCs have been signed and are now&#13;
under implementation (para. 2.17).&#13;
1.4       Hvdropower.  Bangladesh's total hydropower potential is estimated&#13;
at about 1,500 Gigawatt hours (GWh)/year, of which 1,050 GWh/year has been&#13;
developed with the installation of 330 MW capacity on the Karnafuli river at&#13;
Kaptai (near Chittagong). The remaining potential is located at two other&#13;
sites whose development would flood prime agricultural land and require the&#13;
relocation of about 30,000 people. In view of the high cost involved and&#13;
potential social impact, its development is not being considered at this time.&#13;
1.5       Coal.  Recent work by the Geological Survey of Bangladesh in the&#13;
Barapukuria area of Dinajpur district has located several thick coal seams,&#13;
with an estimated in-situ reserve of about 300 million tons. A feasibility&#13;
study funded by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the UK was&#13;
completed in 1990.  In March 1994, GOB signed an agreement with a Chinese&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
consortium for the development of an underground coal mine with a production&#13;
capacity of one million tons of coal per year. Because of the long lead time&#13;
involved, it is not expected that the proposed mine could come into operation&#13;
before the year 1998. Bangladesh is giving due importance to exploration of&#13;
coal and has advertised internationally for foreign investors. Recently, GOB&#13;
has signed a production sharing contract with BHP, USA for exploration and&#13;
development of coal deposits in northwestern region of the country.&#13;
1.6       Traditional Fuels.  Traditional fuels are the predominant sources&#13;
of energy in rural areas. However, biomass supplies are continually&#13;
diminishing on a per capita basis due to deforestation and rapid population&#13;
growth. Increasing fuelwood planting to meet the supply gap is not feasible&#13;
due to the high population density and pressure for agricultural land. The&#13;
decline in the relative contribution of traditional fuels to the country's&#13;
energy supply, from above 65% in the early 1980s to the current level of 55%,&#13;
reflects the role of gas as the main source of supply to meet the country's&#13;
incremental energy requirements.&#13;
B. Enercrv Consumption&#13;
1.7       Bangladesh's annual per capita energy consumption is estimated at&#13;
about 100 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe), among the lowest in the world.&#13;
Per capita annual consumption of commercial energy is estimated to be only 45&#13;
kgoe. In FY93, gross commercial energy consumption was about 5.2 million tons&#13;
of oil equivalent, of which natural gas accounted for 60%, petroleum 32%,&#13;
hydropower 4%, and coal 4%. The consumption of commercial energy increased at&#13;
about 7% a year during the 1980s, compared to an annual average growth rate of&#13;
about 4% for real GDP. With the development of indigenous gas supply, the&#13;
share of natural gas in total commercial energy consumption increased from 26%&#13;
in FY81 to 60% in FY93, making it possible to contain annual imports of crude&#13;
and petroleum products to around two million tons.&#13;
C. Enerov Sector Organization&#13;
1.8       The principal institutions responsible for energy sector policy and&#13;
management are: (a) the Planning Commission, responsible for macroeconomic&#13;
planning; including Five-Year Plans and Annual Development Plans, and (b) the&#13;
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), responsible for overseeing&#13;
the operations of the five publicly-owned energy sector entities that produce,&#13;
transport and deliver most of the commercial energy in Bangladesh. The&#13;
entities are the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Minerals Corporation (Petrobangla),&#13;
the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), the Bangladesh Power Development&#13;
Board (BPDB), the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA), and the Rural&#13;
Electrification Board (REB).&#13;
1.9       Petroleum/Gas Sector.  The gas sector in Bangladesh is dominated by&#13;
the Petrobangla group consisting of eight state-owned companies responsible&#13;
for the exploration, production and delivery of natural gas, as well as the&#13;
exploration for and development of oil and solid minerals, including coal.&#13;
Until mid-1993, the Petrobangla Group consisted of the holding corporation&#13;
(Petrobangla), one exploration and drilling company, two production companies,&#13;
three transmission and distribution companies and a natural gas liquids&#13;
company. In May 1993, the Cabinet approved the establishment of the Gas&#13;
Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) to operate the recently completed&#13;
Kailashtilla-Ashuganj (North-South) pipeline and' the new Ashuganj-Bakhrabad&#13;
pipeline to be constructed under the project, with a view to achieving optimal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
gas supply despatch and providing pipeline access to eventual private gas&#13;
producers when excess capacity is available in the system.&#13;
1.10      BPC is responsible for purchasing and refining crude oil, and&#13;
importing and marketing petroleum products. Refining is carried out at&#13;
Bangladesh's only refinery, the Eastern Refinery Limited (ERL), a BPC&#13;
subsidiary. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is bottled and sold to private&#13;
distributors by LPG Limited (LPGL), another BPC subsidiary. Three other BPC&#13;
subsidiaries (Jamuna, Meghna and Padma oil companies) market petroleum&#13;
products.&#13;
1.11      Power Sector.  BPDB is responsible for electricity generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution, except in areas served by DESA and REB. DESA&#13;
distributes electricity in the Greater Dhaka area, whereas REB is responsible&#13;
for the construction of rural electrification schemes and organizing&#13;
prospective consumers into semi-autonomous cooperatives called Palli Bidyut&#13;
Samities (PBSs) which buy electricity from BPDB and distribute it to their&#13;
consumers.&#13;
D. GOB's EnerQ'y Sector StrateQv&#13;
1.12      Sectoral Obiectives.  In recognition of gas's pivotal role,&#13;
accelerating development of domestic gas resources has been the primary focus&#13;
of GOB's energy sector strategy in the Third and Fourth Five-Year Plans (FY86-&#13;
95). GOB's principal energy sector objectives are to: (a) expand domestic&#13;
natural gas supply to meet energy demand and reduce the country's dependence&#13;
on oil imports; (b) adjust energy prices to promote the efficient and economic&#13;
use of energy, taking into account social objectives; (c) increase the&#13;
availability and improve the quality of electricity supply and reduce system&#13;
losses; (d) improve energy sector entities' performance; and (e) encourage&#13;
private sector participation in energy sector development, particularly in oil&#13;
and gas exploration. To underscore the priority accorded to the sector's&#13;
development, energy accounted for 16% of the total public sector investment&#13;
allocation during the Third Five-Year Plan, of which 29% (US$ 690 million) was&#13;
earmarked for the gas sector.&#13;
1.13      In the pursuit of the above objectives, the main thrust of GOB's&#13;
gas sector strategy in the 1970s was to develop the fields at Titas, Bakhrabad&#13;
and Habiganj to take advantage of their relative proximity to the main markets&#13;
of Dhaka and Chittagong. To ensure adequate long-term supply and optimal&#13;
development of the country's hydrocarbon endowment, a parallel effort was&#13;
initiated in the mid-1980s to develop the large gas fields in the northeastern&#13;
part of the country and to link them with the main consumption centers through&#13;
an integrated gas transmission network.&#13;
1.14      Sectoral Development.  Progress in implementing the energy sector&#13;
strategy has been uneven. Overall, the gas sector has played an important&#13;
role in the country's development during the past decade. The availability of&#13;
low-cost indigenous natural gas has been the basis for the expansion of the&#13;
power sector and the rapid development of the fertilizer industry in&#13;
Bangladesh. Currently, about 90% of power generation is based on natural gas,&#13;
and all of the agricultural sector's urea fertilizer requirements (1.4 million&#13;
tons p.a.) are met by local production using gas as feedstock. Power&#13;
generation and fertilizer production account for about 46% and 35%,&#13;
respectively, of the total gas consumption, with the remaining 19% accounted&#13;
for by industrial, commercial and residential consumers. Unlike many other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
public enterprises, the gas sector has been a significant source of revenue&#13;
for the Treasury. Through payment of excise duty (at a level equal to 62% of&#13;
gross sales revenue in FY93), a 50% corporate tax and dividends, Petrobangla's&#13;
contribution to GOB has been increasing steadily, from Tk 2.0 billion in FY86&#13;
to Tk 7.3 billion (US$ 183 million) in FY93, reflecting the results of a 10%&#13;
average annual increase in the volume of gas sales and average gas tariff.&#13;
1.15      By comparison, the development of the power sector has been&#13;
seriously affected by the continuing poor performance of the two main sector&#13;
entities -- BPDB and DESA, as evidenced by the inordinately high system&#13;
losses, low level of collections and extremely weak finances. To assist GOB&#13;
in effecting a significant and sustained improvement in power sector&#13;
performance, IDA together with other donors has been pursuing an intensive&#13;
dialogue with GOB over the last few years, focussing on the need for GOB to&#13;
undertake basic reforms to address fundamental deficiencies in sector&#13;
governance. Resumption of new lending for power by IDA (and some other major&#13;
donors) depends on GOB's formulating and initiating implementation of a&#13;
credible reform program.&#13;
E. Energy Pricing&#13;
1.16      Natural Gas.  Under IDA's Second Gas Development Project (SGDP,&#13;
Cr. 1586-BD), GOB adopted the principle of pricing natural gas based on the&#13;
estimated economic costs of supply, including a depletion premium. In&#13;
accordance with that agreement, the average price of gas was increased by 20%&#13;
on July 1, 1985 and July 1, 1986, respectively. Starting from 1987, in the&#13;
course of preparing the Energy Sector Adjustment Credit (ESAC, Cr. 1999-BD),&#13;
GOB endorsed the approach of setting gas prices closer to that of substitute&#13;
fuels to mobilize resources for the budget. In line with this, during 1987-&#13;
1992, gas prices were increased on average by 105%, or about 13% p.a., as&#13;
against 9% p.a. average domestic inflation. In March 1994, GOB announced a&#13;
10% increase in end-user tariffs for power, fertilizer, industrial and&#13;
commercial uses retroactive March 1, 1994; monthly charges for unmetered&#13;
domestic consumers were raised by 27% for single burner and 16* for double&#13;
burner. The evolution of gas tariffs for the period 1985-1994 is summarized&#13;
in Table 1.1 and given in greater detail in Annex 1.1. The prevailing end-&#13;
user tariffs for bulk supply to power and fertilizer and the weighted average&#13;
tariff of Tk 54 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) (US$ 1.35/MCF) are comparable to&#13;
the latest estimates of economic costs of supply. However, as can be seen&#13;
from Table 1.1, GOB's excise duty on gas sales has remained high and is the&#13;
root cause of Petrobangla group's weak financial performance. The need for&#13;
further reforms in the levels of retail prices and margins allowed to the&#13;
sector operating companies is discussed in para. 2.19.&#13;

1.17        Petroleum Products.   In the pursuit of its economic efficiency and&#13;
resource mobilization objectives, GOB has maintained domestic prices of&#13;
petroleum products significantly above border prices. Under the ESAC, GOB&#13;
agreed on a pricing formula which would ensure that the weighted average&#13;
domestic petroleum product prices, net of distribution, marketing and other&#13;
handling costs, would always exceed border prices by at least 15%; it also&#13;
agreed not to reduce the weighted average retail price of petroleum products&#13;
below levels existing in FY87. Except for a brief period in early 1990, GOB&#13;
has followed these principles and, in fact, responded very promptly to the&#13;
Gulf crisis in late 1990 with a cumulative increase in petroleum product&#13;
prices of about 85% between August and October 1990. These adjustments have&#13;
also brought the relative pricing structure of domestic prices closer to that&#13;
of border prices. Although world oil prices have now generally returned to&#13;
pre-Gulf crisis levels, GOB's present plans are to maintain the high prices&#13;
for purposes of resource mobilization. Retail prices of petroleum products&#13;
for FY87-94 are given in Annex 1.2.&#13;
1.18        Electricitv.   During 1987-91, BPDB's average tariff rate was&#13;
increased about 39%, or about 91 p.a. in nominal terms, as against domestic&#13;
inflation of about 9t p.a. over the same period.   The average revenue from&#13;
electricity sales in FY93 at Tk 2.3 per kilowatt hour (kWh) (US¢ 5.8/kwh) is&#13;
estimated to be about 65-70% of long-run marginal cost (LRMC).&#13;

II. THE GAS SECTOR&#13;
A. Gas Reserves&#13;
2.1       Natural gas was first discovered in Bangladesh by private companies&#13;
-- Pakistan Petroleum Limited at Sylhet, and Shell at Kailashtilla, Rashidpur,&#13;
Habiganj, Titas and Bakhrabad. These companies, together with the state-owned&#13;
Oil and Gas Development Corporation (OGDC), were exploring for oil and gas on&#13;
a limited scale during the 1950s and 1960s. Immediately after independence,&#13;
GOB took over the private interests in the gas sector, and efforts were made&#13;
to continue exploration and develop the fields at Titas, Habiganj and&#13;
Bakhrabad which are closest to the main markets of Dhaka and Chittagong. By&#13;
1990, these three fields were supplying 93t of the gas used in Bangladesh.&#13;
2.2       The development of the gas fields in Bangladesh is still at a very&#13;
early stage. There are presently 17 known gas fields; however, only the first&#13;
round of appraisal drilling has been made, and only three fields -- Titas,&#13;
Bakhrabad and Habiganj -- have sufficient wells and production data to allow&#13;
reasonably accurate estimates to be made of gas reserves in place and&#13;
recoverable. Because of this, gas reserve estimates have been made in a&#13;
subjective fashion under several studies.  The most conservative estimate puts&#13;
the total gas reserves at 21 TCF, of which 12.4 TCF are considered as&#13;
recoverable.  Five fields -- Kailashtilla, Rashidpur, Habiganj, Titas and&#13;
Bakhrabad -- account for two thirds of the known gas reserves. The reserve&#13;
estimates by each gas field together with the production in FY94 are given in&#13;
Annex 2.1.&#13;
2.3       While the current reserve estimates appear to be small, there is&#13;
significant potential for proving up new gas reserves in the numerous current&#13;
field extensions as well as in new prospects. Several major studies by&#13;
international petroleum consultants indicate that the Bengal Delta Basin,&#13;
which underlies most of Bangladesh, is gas-prone. The likelihood of&#13;
significant increases in the reserve base over and above what is required to&#13;
sustain domestic supply indicates a potential for export.&#13;
B. Gas SuDDly Systems&#13;
2.4       The development of gas supply infrastructure in Bangladesh&#13;
reflects the concentration of economic activity in the country. Presently,&#13;
gas is supplied through three systems, all located in the east zone: (i) the&#13;
Titas system covering the Greater Dhaka area and the Brahmaputra Basin&#13;
northwest of Dhaka, which receives gas from the Titas, Habiganj and Bakhrabad&#13;
gas fields, having maximum daily peak demand of around 560 million cubic feet&#13;
(MMCFD); (ii) the Bakhrabad system covering the southeastern part of the&#13;
country, including the Chittagong area, which takes gas from the Bakhrabad and&#13;
Feni gas fields, having maximum daily peak demand of around 110 MMCFD; and&#13;
(iii) the Jalalabad system covering the Sylhet area, which receives gas from&#13;
the Kailashtilla, Sylhet, and Habiganj gas fields, having maximum daily peak&#13;
demand of 40 MMCFD. The Rashidpur field, a newly developed gas field under&#13;
the SGDP, is now producing at a rate of 82 MMCFD for supply to the Jalalabad&#13;
and Titas franchise areas. Cumulative gas production as of the end of FY94&#13;
was about 2.2 TCF, half of which was drawn from the Titas gas field, followed&#13;
by Habiganj (0.4 TCF) and Bakhrabad (0.4 TCF).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
2.5       Until the mid-1980s, the three gas supply systems were not&#13;
interlinked. Recognizing the capacity constraint of the Titas gas field in&#13;
meeting the projected incremental gas demand in the Titas franchise area, GOB&#13;
adopted the strategy of focusing on developing the large gas fields at&#13;
Kailashtilla, Rashidpur and Habiganj in the northeastern part of the country&#13;
to cover gas supply shortages in the Titas franchise via the Kailashtilla-&#13;
Ashuganj (North-South) pipeline. Further integration of the three supply&#13;
systems into one grid via the Ashuganj-Bakhrabad (A-B) pipeline was planned&#13;
for a later stage. To support GOB's effort, the SGDP (Cr. 1586-BD, approved&#13;
in April 1985) was conceived, which provided financing for appraisal and&#13;
development drilling (nine wells), installation of gas and condensate&#13;
treatment facilities, and construction of the North-South pipeline and a&#13;
parallel condensate pipeline.&#13;
C. Gas Demand and SupplY Outlook&#13;
2.6       Past Trend.  Annual gas sales more than tripled during the 1980s,&#13;
increasing from 45.7 BCF in FY80 to 159.9 BCF in FY90, equivalent to an&#13;
average annual growth of 13%. The growth tapered off to around 7% during&#13;
FY91-94, partly due to the power sector's inability to undertake planned&#13;
generation capacity expansion investments as a result of donors' suspension of&#13;
new lending to power. Gas sales to each sector for FYBO-94 is given in Annex&#13;
2.2. During this period, power and fertilizer combined accounted for 83% of&#13;
the incremental gas sales. In FY94, power generation and fertilizer&#13;
production accounted for about 46% and 35t, respectively, of the total gas&#13;
consumption, followed by industry (10%), domestic (7%) and commercial (2%).&#13;
2.7       System Loss Reduction Plan.  Gas supply to domestic consumers&#13;
expanded rapidly during the past decade, and the total number of connections&#13;
rose from some 225,000 in 1985 to about 528,000 in 1993. The vast majority of&#13;
domestic consumers (404,000) are supplied by the Titas Gas Transmission and&#13;
Distribution Company (TGTDC). Domestic users are offered the option of a&#13;
single or double burner connection, which forms the basis for the flat rate&#13;
billing system adopted by the three distribution companies in the late 1980s.&#13;
This arrangement replaced the former system based on metering because of major&#13;
problems arising from faulty meters and insufficient replacements.&#13;
Unfortunately, the flat rate system has been abused as customers hook up&#13;
additional appliances or commercial users seek to be classified as domestic&#13;
connections. Meter tampering, illegal connections and underbilling have also&#13;
contributed to the problem. As a result, the difference between total gas&#13;
sales and purchases in TGTDC rose from 2% in FY81 to 9t in FY93. To stem loss&#13;
of revenues, during the processing of ADB's Third Natural Gas Development&#13;
Project, TGTDC/GOB agreed to implement a system loss reduction plan. The main&#13;
elements being pursued include: (a) increase in the assessed volume of gas&#13;
consumption by non-metered domestic consumers; (b) disconnection of delinquent&#13;
consumers; (c) installation of 60,000 meters in the first phase, starting with&#13;
households with multiple appliances; and (d) contracting out meter-reading,&#13;
billing and collections in selected service areas. While GOB has raised the&#13;
expectations that TGTDC bring down its overall system losses to 2% by June 30,&#13;
1995, a gradual reduction to about 4% by FY97 appears more realistic and&#13;
achievable.&#13;
2.8       Gas Demand Forecast.  Given the dominance of power generation in&#13;
gas utilization, growth in electricity supply will continue to be a key&#13;
determinant of gas demand. To support higher economic growth required for a&#13;
significant reduction in poverty, provision of adequate electricity supply is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- a -&#13;
essential. Given the economic benefits of gas use in combined-cycle power&#13;
plants and its environmental benefits, gas offers the least cost option for&#13;
the country's power generation requirements.&#13;
2.9        The gas demand forecast for FY95-2000 is summarized in Table 2.1&#13;
and given in more detail in Annex  2.3.  The forecast is based on the planned&#13;
generation capacity additions, totalling 1529 MW, during the forecast period,&#13;
commissioning of new fertilizer plants, and a projected aggregate growth of&#13;
10% p.a. for the remaining consumer categories in line with the historical&#13;
trend. Total gas sales are projected to grow on average at 9% p.a., with the&#13;
share of power generation in gas consumption increasing to 55% by FY2000.&#13;
About half of the projected incremental demand, 500 MMCFD by FY2000, would be&#13;
in the Bakhrabad franchise area; the known new loads include: the KAFCO joint&#13;
venture fertilizer plant (commissioning date January 1995), the second 210 MW&#13;
steam turbine power generating unit at Raujan near Chittagong (financed by&#13;
supplier's credit from China, commissioning date January 1997), and 600 MW of&#13;
combined-cycle generating capacity at Meghnaghat (commissioning date December&#13;
1998 onwards).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
2.10      SupplY Outlook.  While Bangladesh has significant gas reserves, the&#13;
country is currently faced with a major supply constraint. Because of&#13;
cumulative delays in the completion of gas field development, pipeline&#13;
infrastructure and surface facilities, demand started to outstrip deliverable&#13;
supply capacity in 1993. The tight gas supply situation is partly responsible&#13;
for the high flow rates imposed on the producing wells and for deferring much-&#13;
needed well workover in the Titas and Bakhrabad fields. Consequently,&#13;
Bakhrabad has been showing pressure drop in recent years; out of the eight&#13;
production wells, three need workovers and two are producing at half capacity.&#13;
In view of that the current production level of 150 MMCFD at the Bakhrabad&#13;
field barely satisfies the present demand and is not sustainable, development&#13;
of production capacity at the large, known fields in the north and transfer of&#13;
surplus gas supply to the gas-deficient southern region through&#13;
interconnecting the two transmission subsystems represents the least-cost&#13;
approach.&#13;
2.11      Priority Investment Proaram.  To balance supply with demand in the&#13;
medium term, a priority investment program (PIP) to be implemented during&#13;
FY95-2000 has been drawn up. The PIP, estimated at about US$ 600 million in&#13;
1994 prices, consists primarily of (a) development drilling of 15 new wells&#13;
and installation of associated gas treatment facilities; (b) workover of eight&#13;
existing wells at Titas and Bakhrabad gas fields; (c) integration and&#13;
expansion of the high pressure transmission grid by construction of the&#13;
Ashuganj-Bakhrabad pipeline (58 km), the Habiganj-Ashuganj loopline (53 km),&#13;
addition of compressor capacity, and installation of a new Supervisory Control&#13;
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and pipeline telecommunication system; and (d)&#13;
upgrading and expansion of gas distribution network. Details of the PIP are&#13;
given in Annex 2.4. The proposed project, together with assistance extended&#13;
by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund&#13;
(OECF) of Japan, would help finance the most urgently needed components of the&#13;
PIP; private sector financing of investments scheduled for the outer years of&#13;
the PIP is being pursued. Any delay in execution of those investments, for&#13;
which financing is yet to be arranged, will not affect the implementation or&#13;
the viability of the proposed project (para. 6.5). To ensure satisfactory&#13;
implementation of the PIP, it was agreed during negotiations that, prior to&#13;
the beginning of each fiscal year, GOB will review with IDA the gas sector's&#13;
PIP and its implementation in the current fiscal year, as well as the&#13;
implementation plan for the three succeeding fiscal years.&#13;
D. Sector Constraints&#13;
2.12      Bangladesh's gas sector is now at a critical juncture.  The sector&#13;
has a large potential for increased contribution to the country's economic&#13;
growth. However, experience of the past decade clearly indicates that, for&#13;
the country to fully benefit from its hydrocarbon endowment, GOB needs to take&#13;
steps to address the major constraints on the sector's development, i.e., the&#13;
country's limited financial resources and technology limitations, and the&#13;
Petrobangla group's weak institutional capability.&#13;
2.13      Capital Shortages.  Funds required to enable accelerated sector&#13;
development far exceed what the GOB can manage to allocate to it. Minimum&#13;
investments required up to the year 2000 to balance supply and domestic demand&#13;
are estimated at about US$ 600 million in 1994 prices (para. 2.11). This&#13;
amount could increase significantly depending on the pace of the sector's&#13;
future development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
2.14      PetrobanQla GrouD's Canabilitv.  Notwithstanding its contribution&#13;
to resource mobilization, Petrobangla group's limited implementation&#13;
capability has impaired the delivery of prior gas sector investments.&#13;
Presently, the group has insufficient in-house capability to plan, design and&#13;
supervise the sector's expansion program. Moreover, operation and maintenance&#13;
capabilities need to be built up commensurate with the system expansion that&#13;
has so far been undertaken.&#13;
2.15      Several factors have contributed to the Petrobangla group's weak&#13;
institutional capability and inadequate performance. First, since its&#13;
inception, the Petrobangla group has been operated like an extension of the&#13;
Government. Besides tariff setting, many operational decisions are controlled&#13;
by GOB. The group is governed by the Government salary scales and internal&#13;
procedures, and requires approval from the Government agencies for&#13;
investments, operating budgets, procurement and staffing. Operating budgets&#13;
are not tied to annual and long term corporate plans, and there are no agreed&#13;
sets of specific, annual and quantified performance targets for the group and&#13;
individual operating companies. Thus, the accountability of the group's&#13;
management for performance is severely undermined. Second, GOB's excessive&#13;
levy of excise duty on gas sales has resulted in OC margins that neither meet&#13;
financial requirements nor reflect cost structures; this is the root cause of&#13;
the group's low earning capacity and weak financial position. Third, being a&#13;
state-owned monopoly and having two state-owned entities -- BPDB and the&#13;
Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation, BCIC -- as its major consumers,&#13;
the group faces no competition and, therefore, has not been spurred to improve&#13;
performance.&#13;
E. Directions of Reform&#13;
2.16      In order to mobilize the capital required for accelerated sector&#13;
development and improve the performance of the existing sector entities, GOB&#13;
has recognized the need to overhaul the prevailing.sector arrangements. The&#13;
main initiatives being pursued by GOB relate to increasing private sector&#13;
participation, particularly by IOCs, and commercializing/privatizing existing&#13;
operations.&#13;
2.17      Private Sector Particilation.  With its potential hydrocarbon&#13;
endowment, Bangladesh would benefit immensely from the risk capital,&#13;
management expertise, efficient operations, technical advances and global&#13;
experience that IOCs could provide under favorable conditions. Until&#13;
recently, Bangladesh was unsuccessful in attracting private capital in&#13;
hydrocarbon development, basically because incentives offered were not&#13;
attractive. During the preparation of the proposed project, IDA has been&#13;
pursuing a continuing dialogue with GOB on the need to create an enabling&#13;
environment to promote private participation in the gas sector. Over the past&#13;
two years, GOB has made significant progress in this regard. In July 1993,&#13;
GOB announced a new Petroleum Policy which offers significantly liberalized&#13;
contractual terms for production sharing contracts (PSCs), including tax&#13;
exemptions and the direct linkage of gas producer prices to the international&#13;
fuel oil price. Furthermore, highly prospective exploration blocks originally&#13;
reserved for Petrobangla have now been opened for private bidding. In May&#13;
1993, the Cabinet approved the establishment of GTCL, which will provide equal&#13;
access to private gas producers and operate on the basis of a wheeling charge.&#13;
GOB also lifted the long-standing ban on the importation of LPG to enable&#13;
private entry in LPG imports, bottling and distribution. In September 1993,&#13;
GOB with IDA's assistance held an investment promotion roundtable in Houston,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
which was attended by representatives of 45 IOCs. To date, the responses from&#13;
the IOCs have been encouraging; four PSCs have been signed, and negotiations&#13;
with interested IOCs for other exploration blocks are proceeding in earnest.&#13;
2.18      Commercialization/Privatization of Petrobanala Group.  There is a&#13;
broad consensus at the Government level that privatization of the Petrobangla&#13;
group would help transform the individual OCs into efficient businesses. GOB&#13;
is planning to float a portion of its shareholding in two OCs -- Bangladesh&#13;
Gas Fields Company and Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company -- in&#13;
the local capital market. To make the eventual privatization offerings&#13;
successful, GOB needs to carry out a range of readying steps. These include&#13;
(a) letting OCs operate under private company law in form and substance with&#13;
adequate managerial autonomy; (b) reforming gas tariffs to enable OCs to&#13;
operate on a commercial basis; (c) decentralizing operational decision-making&#13;
and developing competition in the sector, with each OC becoming an independent&#13;
entity charged with being financially self-sufficient and placing its&#13;
financial relationship with other OCs and GOB at arm's length; and (d)&#13;
establishing a regulatory framework and institutional arrangements to monitor&#13;
operator performance, prevent abuses of market power, and promote the&#13;
development of competition. Under the ADB's Third Natural Gas Development&#13;
Project, consultants are being engaged to help GOB formulate an action program&#13;
for (i) the restructuring/ divestiture/privatization of the existing gas&#13;
sector entities; (ii) the establishment of an appropriate petroleum/gas sector&#13;
regulatory framework and a national regulatory function for a decentralized&#13;
petroleum/gas sector with mixed ownership; and (iii) the implementation of a&#13;
rational gas pricing structure. It was confirmed during negotiations that GOB&#13;
will, by December 1995, carry out a joint review with IDA and other donors of&#13;
its action program for strengthening the institutional and regulatory&#13;
frameworks for the petroleum/gas sector.&#13;
2.19      Gas Tariff Reform.  Given the fact that Bangladesh is presently a&#13;
net oil importer, and the country has potential for developing gas export, an&#13;
appropriate benchmark in setting gas prices is the cost of substitute fuel&#13;
(e.g., fuel oil) or the value of gas export that would have to be foregone to&#13;
satisfy domestic demand. Using fuel oil as a comparator, the import-parity&#13;
price of gas is about $ 2.2/MCF, or about twice the present tariff for&#13;
electricity geheration. To provide adequate incentives to attract private&#13;
investment in natural gas development, GOB has decided to use 75% of the&#13;
international price of high sulphur fuel oil (less a negotiable discount) as&#13;
the benchmark in determining the wellhead price of non-associated gas to be&#13;
offered to private gas producers.  To implement the above pricing formula and&#13;
to enable the public gas sector entities to operate on a commercial basis and&#13;
be self-sustaining, GOB needs to implement a phased program of tariff reform&#13;
to: (i) raise wellhead gas price to the above-mentioned benchmark; (ii) ensure&#13;
an adequate margin for the gas production companies through reducing GOB's&#13;
excise duty; and (iii) rationalize the margins allowed to the gas transmission&#13;
and distribution companies based on the costs incurred in meeting the demands&#13;
of various consumer groups, taking into account the financial objectives of&#13;
the entities involved and appropriate socio-economic considerations. As a&#13;
first step, GOB increased the average end-user gas tariff by 1Ot effective&#13;
March 1, 1994 with a parallel reduction of GOB's excise duty from 62% to 55%.&#13;
At the same time, GOB decided to implement the following: (i) 2% of the gas&#13;
transmission and distribution OCs' gross sales revenue will be withheld, on a&#13;
time-bound basis, by GOB to recoup the amount required for servicing the&#13;
external debt incurred in connection with the past operations of the&#13;
Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration Company (BAPEX); (ii) upto 2% of gross gas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
sales revenue will be withheld on a time-bound basis and administered by&#13;
Petrobangla to meet BAPEX's expenses during its restructuring; and (iii) a&#13;
hydrocarbon development fund to the tune of 2.5% of gross gas sales revenue&#13;
will be established to help strengthen the OCs' self-financing capabilities;&#13;
the amount of revenue so appropriated will be allocated among the gas&#13;
production, transmission and distribution OCs on the basis of their respective&#13;
shares of group margins and volumes of operations. The net impact of the&#13;
above raised the combined margins of the gas production, transmission and&#13;
distribution OCs from 36% to 41% as of March 1, 1994. During negotiations,&#13;
GOB agreed that it will, before the start of each fiscal year, review with IDA&#13;
the margins allowed to the gas operating companies in respect of such year.&#13;
F. IDA's Role&#13;
2.20      Past ExDerience.  IDA's involvement with Bangladesh's energy sector&#13;
began in 1979 when a credit of US$ 28 million was made to GOB to help finance&#13;
the electricity distribution system for the Greater Khulna area. To date, IDA&#13;
has made 14 credits for the energy sector in Bangladesh. IDA funds committed&#13;
through these operations have totalled US$ 903 million, representing about 16%&#13;
of total IDA resources committed to Bangladesh. Seven of the credits (US$ 454&#13;
million) were for power projects, two (US$ 186 million) for gas, four (US$ 146&#13;
million) for petroleum exploration promotion, refinery modification and LPG&#13;
development, and one (US$ 116 million) for the Energy Sector Adjustment Credit&#13;
(ESAC). Eleven projects have been completed. Projects currently under&#13;
implementation include two power distribution projects and the LPG Transport&#13;
and Distribution Project (Cr. 2263-BD).&#13;
2.21      The two IDA-financed gas sector projects -- the Bakhrabad Gas&#13;
Development Project (Cr. 1091-BD) and the Second Gas Development Project&#13;
(Cr. 1586-BD) -- featured substantial cofinancing from several bilateral&#13;
sources, including the Canadian International Development Agency, the&#13;
Directorate General Voor Internationale Samenwerking (the Netherlands), the UK&#13;
Overseas Development Administration (ODA), the Japan Overseas Economic&#13;
Cooperation Fund (OECF), the OPEC Fund for International Development, and the&#13;
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The Bakhrabad Gas Development&#13;
Project was approved in December 1980 and consisted of: (a) drilling of five&#13;
wells at the Bakhrabad gas field, (b) the installation of associated gas&#13;
treatment facilities, (c) a 24-inch, 177 km pipeline from Bakhrabad to&#13;
Chittagong, and (d) a 88 km distribution network in and around Chittagong.&#13;
The project was successfully implemented with only a slight delay from the&#13;
original schedule.&#13;
2.22      The Second Gas Development Project (SGDP) suffered an initial&#13;
implementation delay of almost three years, due primarily to the delay in&#13;
procuring and mobilizing the bilaterally financed drilling rig for the&#13;
project's drilling component. In the absence of drilling results, the design&#13;
and procurement for the gas and condensate treatment facilities and the&#13;
Kailashtilla-Ashuganj (North-South) pipeline could not proceed. The project&#13;
finally started in 1988; the drilling component was successfully completed in&#13;
December 1990, followed by the completion of the Kailashtilla-Ashuganj gas and&#13;
condensate pipelines in May 1992. The drilling results have been very&#13;
encouraging. All nine new wells drilled were successful and completed as&#13;
production wells; besides providing a total productive capacity of about&#13;
300 MMCFD, they proved about 4 TCF of recoverable gas reserves, increasing the&#13;
country's proven recoverable gas reserves from about 8 TCF to 12 TCF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.23      In response to the findings that the Kailashtilla field contains&#13;
much larger reserves than previously estimated and is relatively rich in&#13;
natural gas liquids (NGLs) including propane and butane, extensive&#13;
consultations between GOB/Petrobangla, IDA and other cofinanciers took place&#13;
and a decision was reached to change the original design of gas treatment&#13;
facilities proposed for the Kailashtilla field with a view to extracting&#13;
propane and butane to produce LPG. The agreed configuration comprises: (i) a&#13;
90 MMCFD molecular sieve turbo-expander at Kailashtilla to extract NGLs&#13;
(financed by ODA); and (ii) a fractionation plant at Ashuganj to fractionate&#13;
the NGLs which would be transported from Kailashtilla to Ashuganj using the&#13;
North-South condensate pipeline already constructed under the SGDP. The&#13;
contract for the turbo-expander was awarded in December 1991. However, funds&#13;
provided under the SGDP for the proposed Ashuganj NGL fractionation plant were&#13;
not utilized because of the failure to award the contract in time. The credit&#13;
for the SGDP was closed on December 31, 1993 after three one-year extensions.&#13;
2.24      To find a suitable solution, GOB requested IDA to finance the&#13;
fractionation plant through the restructuring of the LPG Transport and&#13;
Distribution Project (Cr. 2263-BD). The above credit for SDR 49.8 million&#13;
(US$ 67.2 million) was approved on June 11, 1991 to fund investments for the&#13;
downstream storage, transport, bottling and cylinder distribution of LPG to be&#13;
made available by the proposed Ashuganj NGL fractionation plant; the credit&#13;
was signed on June 21, 1991 and became effective on September 30, 1992.&#13;
Because contract award of the Ashuganj NGL fractionation plant is a condition&#13;
of disbursement, implementation of the LPG Project has practically been on&#13;
hold. On the other hand, GOB's recent decision to allow private entry in LPG&#13;
imports, bottling and distribution has opened the possibility of securing&#13;
private financing for the LPG storage facilities, bottling plants and&#13;
cylinders, valves and regulators included in the LPG Project. In response to&#13;
GOB's commitment to seek private sector involvement, IDA is now considering&#13;
GOB's request to modify the project scope and reallocate credit proceeds for&#13;
financing a NGL fractionation plant. As an interim arrangement, the molecular&#13;
sieve turbo-expander has been modified to permit re-injection of the propane&#13;
and butane fractions back into the pipeline gas stream. The-turbo-expander,&#13;
together with the two wells at Kailashtilla, was commissioned in November&#13;
1994.&#13;
2.25      Lessons Learned.  In summary, GOB's protracted procurement&#13;
procedures, high turnover of key personnel in the project implementation unit,&#13;
and complexity resulting from multiple parallel cofinancing arrangements are&#13;
the primary implementation impediments. Based on the lessons learned from the&#13;
SGDP, a number of safeguards have been included in the project design to&#13;
minimize implementation slippages. These include: (a) beneficiaries taking&#13;
direct responsibilities for project implementation coupled with an adequate&#13;
provision of project implementation support technical assistance; (b) advance&#13;
procurement actions to minimize procurement delays; and (c) IDA's close&#13;
project supervision through annual and mid-term reviews against a set of&#13;
agreed project implementation targets (para. 4.44).&#13;
2.26      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Given the gas sector's importance&#13;
to the country's economic development, IDA's country assistance strategy&#13;
approved by the Board on February 17, 1994 seeks and supports reforms by GOB&#13;
to open the sector for private participation and improve overall sector&#13;
management. The policy reforms recently undertaken by GOB evolved to a large&#13;
extent from the intensive dialogue with IDA over the past two years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Nevertheless, the reform process in the gas sector has only just begun and&#13;
much remains to be done. In this context, IDA's lending strategy in the gas&#13;
sector is focused on: (a) supporting the creation of an enabling environment&#13;
for increased private sector participation; (b) partially financing&#13;
Petrobangla's urgent investment requirements to help balance supply with&#13;
demand in the immediate term, thereby minimizing the costs of impending supply&#13;
shortages to the economy; and (c) assisting sector entities to build technical&#13;
and managerial capabilities in key areas essential for efficient and safe&#13;
operation of an integrated gas supply and delivery network. The proposed&#13;
project, together with a restructured LPG Project, would help remove&#13;
imbalances/bottlenecks in the gas supply and delivery infrastructure and&#13;
support the implementation by GOB of ongoing and further sector reforms.&#13;
III. THE BENEFICIARIES&#13;
A. Backcround&#13;
3.1       Under the Petroleum Act of 1974, the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and&#13;
Minerals Corporation (BOGMC) was established as a state corporation entrusted&#13;
with the exploration for and production of oil; import, refining and marketing&#13;
of petroleum products; and exploration, production and delivery of natural&#13;
gas. In 1976, the functions relating to import, refining and marketing of&#13;
petroleum products were transferred to the newly established Bangladesh&#13;
Petroleum Corporation (BPC). By 1985, BOGMC consisted of five regional&#13;
operating companies: the Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited (BGFCL) and the&#13;
Sylhet Gas Fields Limited (SGFL), operating the fields at Titas and Habiganj,&#13;
and at Sylhet, Chattak and Kailashtilla, respectively; the Bakhrabad Gas&#13;
Systems Limited (BGSL) responsible for producing the Bakhrabad gas field and&#13;
delivering gas in the Bakhrabad franchise area; the Titas Gas Transmission and&#13;
Distribution Company (TGTDC) and the Jalalabad Gas Transmission and&#13;
Distribution Systems Limited (JGTDSL) dealing with gas transmission and&#13;
distribution in the Titas and Jalalabad franchise areas, respectively.&#13;
3.2       The organization of BOGMC owed much to progressive historical&#13;
developments, with the production and distribution activities growing out of&#13;
the previous private sector operations. During the preparation of the SGDP,&#13;
an international management consultant was retained to examine its&#13;
organizational structure and management systems with a view to determining how&#13;
far, and in what manner, existing structure and systems would need to be&#13;
changed so as to best serve future development. Based on the consultant's&#13;
recommendations, a program for the reorganization of BOGMC was agreed during&#13;
the ESAC negotiations. The main thrusts of the reorganization were to divest&#13;
BOGMC of all operational activities and to reorganize them, together with&#13;
those of the existing OCs, under a new set of operationally independent OCs&#13;
organized along functional lines. BOGMC would then operate as a holding&#13;
company, holding equity in the OCs on GOB's behalf and being responsible for&#13;
investment planning and monitoring as well as sector policy formulation. The&#13;
reorganization was to be carried out in two phases; the first phase focussed&#13;
on the legal restructuring of BOGMC, followed by institution- building&#13;
technical assistance to help individual OCs establish appropriate accounting,&#13;
financial management and management information systems in the second phase.&#13;
3.3       To date, BOGMC's reorganization has been partially implemented.  In&#13;
July 1989, BOGMC was restructured into a holding corporation named&#13;
Petrobangla, and seven operating companies -- two gas production companies,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
three regional transmission and distribution companies, a national exploration&#13;
and drilling company, and a natural gas liquids company. However, measures to&#13;
accord adequate managerial as well as financial autonomy to the OCs, thereby&#13;
enabling them to operate on a full commercial basis, are yet to be&#13;
implemented. Implementation of the second phase was basically stalled due to&#13;
a difference between GOB and the donor agency (ODA) regarding the terms of&#13;
reference and the extent of external assistance. ODA has agreed to resume the&#13;
technical assistance under the proposed project (para. 4.12).&#13;
B. OrQanization and Management&#13;
3.4       Petrobangla is answerable to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral&#13;
Resources (MEMR) and is managed by a GOB-nominated nine-member Board including&#13;
the chairman. Five directors are responsible, respectively, for Operations,&#13;
Planning, Mines &amp; Minerals, Finance, and Administration. In broad terms, all&#13;
decisions relating to gas pricing, operating and development budgets of&#13;
individual oCs, organizational set-up and staffing, and major procurement&#13;
exceeding Taka 75 million (US$ 1.9 million) must be referred to GOB.&#13;
3.5       The Petrobangla group's highly centralized decision-making is&#13;
characterized by a practice of strictly hierarchical communication and very&#13;
limited horizontal coordination. Management attention is mainly concentrated&#13;
on day-to-day operations, on fulfilling GOB's administrative requirements with&#13;
respect to project sanctioning and procurement, and on cumbersome internal&#13;
procedures resulting from inadequate delegation of operational responsibility&#13;
to the OCs.&#13;
C. Staffing and Training&#13;
3.6       As of end 1993, the Petrobangla group had about 7,500 employees.  A&#13;
summary of staff composition by each operating company is given in Annex 3.1.&#13;
The three transmission and distribution OCs had a combined staff level of&#13;
about 4,200 people serving about 536,000 consumers, yielding a&#13;
consumer/employee ratio of 127:1. Currently, there are serious staffing&#13;
imbalances in the group; for example, the consumer/employee ratio of BGSL at&#13;
59:1 is only one third of the level achieved in TGTDC (177:1). Besides the&#13;
problem of overstaffing in some OCs, the group has been suffering from&#13;
shortages of motivated and experienced technical and professional staff. To&#13;
overcome these manpower problems will require both short-term and long-term&#13;
measures, including reform of the compensation and reward system to enable OCs&#13;
to attract and retain the high- quality staff needed to operate the gas supply&#13;
system in an efficient and effective manner.&#13;
3.7       Mainly due to the cumbersome GOB approval procedures pertaining to&#13;
the selection of candidates for training, staff training has not received&#13;
adequate attention during the past decade. Despite provisions made by each of&#13;
the co-financiers under the SGDP, training undertaken was very limited.&#13;
Recognizing the urgent need to develop and upgrade the skills of its staff to&#13;
operate a gas supply and delivery system of growing size and complexity,&#13;
Petrobangla management has decided to initiate a training program to develop&#13;
in-house capabilities in all aspects of gas sector operations. The proposed&#13;
project would help train the Petrobangla group's staff in key areas (para.&#13;
4.13). Attention would be given to the selection of both hosting&#13;
organizations and target groups. Progress and effectiveness of the training&#13;
component would be closely monitored through quarterly progress reporting and&#13;
IDA supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
D. Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.8       Accounts.  Petrobangla and its OCs are required by law to prepare&#13;
full commercial accounts. A recent review carried out by an ODA-financed&#13;
consultant concludes that basic accounting systems are in place in all the OCs&#13;
excepting BAPEX. To improve the timeliness and accuracy of financial data,&#13;
and to build up the capability of Petrobangla's/OCs' management to use&#13;
financial data for better operational control, a management system improvement&#13;
program (MSIP) would be implemented under the project with ODA financing&#13;
(para. 4.12). The MSIP would include an extensive training program for&#13;
financial, accounting and internal audit staff.&#13;
3.9       Audit.  The Petrobangla group of companies is subject to two types&#13;
of external audit. The first audit is by a firm of chartered accountants.&#13;
Accounts are required to be ready for external audit within six months&#13;
following the end of the financial year and are audited within three months&#13;
after submission. The quality of audit reports and the degree of information&#13;
provided in audit reports produced by Bangladeshi chartered accounting firms&#13;
is very variable. The second form of audit for state-owned enterprises is&#13;
GOB's commercial audit. These audit arrangements are adequate, except for the&#13;
timeframes for the preparation of statements and their audit. To ensure&#13;
accountability for resources used by the project beneficiaries, it was agreed&#13;
during negotiations that Petrobangla, SGFL and GTCL will submit to IDA audited&#13;
annual accounts together with the auditor's reports within six months of the&#13;
end of the fiscal year under consideration.&#13;
E. Beneficiaries&#13;
3.10      GTCL.  With the recently completed North-South pipeline and the A-B&#13;
pipeline to be constructed under the proposed project, Bangladesh would have&#13;
an interconnected high pressure gas transmission system in the eastern zone of&#13;
the country. Effective dispatching of gas supply to allow greater flexibility&#13;
in field management and increased supply reliability would be significantly&#13;
enhanced by the creation of the GTCL, which would operate the North-South&#13;
pipeline and the A-B pipeline. The Cabinet approved the establishment of GTCL&#13;
in May 1993; subsequently GTCL was incorporated under the 1913 Companies Act&#13;
in December 1993 as a public limited Company with an initial authorized share&#13;
capital of Tk-lo billion (US$ 251 million). GTCL's Memorandum and Articles of&#13;
Association allow it to operate as a common carrier and permit it to form&#13;
joint ventures with private partners; thus, its formation would also&#13;
facilitate equal pipeline access by private gas producers. GTCL's&#13;
organizational set-up is given in Annex 3.2. Appointment of GTCL's Board and&#13;
key staff has been made and GTCL started operations as of December 14, 1993.&#13;
Institutional support will be provided under the project through a (twinning)&#13;
arrangement with an established gas transmission company which can provide&#13;
broad-based technical assistance in key operational areas (para. 4.9).&#13;
3.11      SGFL.  SGFL was set up in 1972 when GOB took over the operations of&#13;
the former Pakistan Petroleum Limited and entrusted their management to the&#13;
newly created company. SGFL is responsible for operating the northern gas&#13;
fields, including Kailashtilla, Rashidpur, Beani Bazar. In FY94, SGFL&#13;
accounted for 10% of total gas supply in Bangladesh; however, with the&#13;
commissioning of existing and planned supply capacity at Rashidpur and&#13;
Kailashtilla, SGFL's operation would expand rapidly and its share in total gas&#13;
supply is projected to increase to 33% by FY98. SGFL currently has 310&#13;
employees; its organization chart is given in Annex 3.3.&#13;

IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Proiect Obiectives&#13;
4.1       In line with GOB's energy sector objectives and IDA's lending&#13;
strategy in the gas sector (paras. 1.12 and 2.26), the proposed project's&#13;
objectives are:&#13;
(a) to alleviate the worsening gas supply shortages through partially&#13;
financing the sector's priority investments;&#13;
(b) to assist GOB in implementing further reforms to improve the&#13;
enabling environment for private sector participation in the&#13;
sector; and&#13;
(c) to develop the sector entities' institutional capabilities,&#13;
particularly in the areas of operations and maintenance, safety,&#13;
environmental protection, and accounting and financial management.&#13;
B. Proiect Description&#13;
4.2       To achieve the project objectives, the project consists of the&#13;
following components:&#13;
(a)  a 58 km, 30-inch diameter gas pipeline from Ashuganj to Bakhrabad;&#13;
(b) a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and pipeline&#13;
telecommunication system for the entire transmission trunkline from&#13;
Kailashtilla to Chittagong and integration with existing&#13;
facilities;&#13;
(c) three production wells at the Rashidpur gas field;&#13;
(d) a gas processing plant to purify gas from the new wells;&#13;
(e) technical assistance consisting of:&#13;
(i) project implementation support through consulting services to&#13;
prepare designs and bid documents, assist in bid evaluation and&#13;
provide construction supervision/management for the components&#13;
listed in items (a), (b), (c) and (d) above;&#13;
(ii) institution-building assistance through consultancy and&#13;
management services to develop GTCL's managerial and technical&#13;
capabilities, establish a group-wide environmental and safety&#13;
management system, strengthen reservoir management, and improve&#13;
the Petrobangla group's management systems; and&#13;
(iii) training of Petrobangla staff in key aspects of gas sector&#13;
operations.&#13;
Details of the specific components are outlined below. Full details of the&#13;
project's physical components are given in Annex 4.1 and their geographic&#13;
locations shown on Map IBRD 25735.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Aszhuani-Bakhrabad PiDeline (USS 63.3 million)&#13;
4.3       To transport gas from the northern fields of Rashidpur, Habiganj&#13;
and Kailashtilla to the gas-deficient southeastern region, the need for, and&#13;
the urgency of, the A-B pipeline is self-evident. The A-B pipeline will link&#13;
the recently completed North-South pipeline (170 km long, 24-inch diameter,&#13;
320 MMCFD capacity) with the Bakhrabad-Chittagong gas transmission system (176&#13;
km long, 24-inch diameter, 320 MMCFD capacity). The pipeline would have a&#13;
diameter of 30 inches and an initial flow rate of 200 MMCFD. The large&#13;
diameter is chosen to minimize gas transmission pressure drop and, more&#13;
importantly, to allow a considerable increase in the line's capacity (up to&#13;
1000 MMCFD) through compression, which is expected to be required at a much&#13;
later stage. The pipeline route has been surveyed and selected taking into&#13;
account possible future offtake points and the need for minimizing involuntary&#13;
resettlement. The route runs through a poorly drained lowland which is&#13;
aubject to annual flooding. The pipeline would be buried in the ground to a&#13;
minimum depth of 1.2 meters. To prevent the pipeline from floating during the&#13;
monsoon season, concrete weight coating would be applied to the entire length&#13;
of the pipeline. Construction of the pipeline would involve three river&#13;
crossings (the Titas/Pagla River near Ashuganj, and the Buri and Gumti Rivers&#13;
near Bakhrabad), and is estimated to cost US$ 63.3 million (39% of total&#13;
project cost).&#13;
SCADA and Telecommunication System (USS 23.2 million)&#13;
4.4       Except for the recently completed ADB-financed Brahmaputra basin&#13;
distribution network, which has a SCADA system (without dispatch center), the&#13;
existing gas transmission and distribution networks are not equipped with&#13;
SCADA. These networks have been operated independently with microwave radio&#13;
links supplemented by telephone facilities. After completion of the A-B&#13;
pipeline, efficient management of a major gas trunkline, which runs form&#13;
Kailashtilla in the northeast to Chittagong in the southeast, requires a&#13;
complete SCAQDA system with dispatch center and telecommunication link. This&#13;
would allow accurate monitoring and control of all transmission parameters&#13;
such as gas flows at supply and offtake points, current line pressures&#13;
throughout the network, movement of gas and condensate volumes, and quality of&#13;
gas being supplied to the system by the producing companies. Furthermore, the&#13;
SCADA would provide pipeline integrity monitoring, leak detection and alarm,&#13;
metering values of gas and condensate at each of the inlet and outlet points,&#13;
open-closed status of all line and station valves, direct digital data&#13;
transmission and voice communication. To allow data transmission, the&#13;
microwave analog radio system of the Bakhrabad-Chittagong pipeline would be&#13;
upgraded (digitized) to match the new system. The proposed SCADA and&#13;
telecommunication system would be of a modular type to facilitate its&#13;
operation and maintenance. The installation of the SCADA system with dispatch&#13;
center and telecommunication would cost about US$ 23.2 million (14% of the&#13;
project cost).&#13;
Development of RashidDur Gas Field (USS 47.7 million)&#13;
4.5       The Rashidpur gas field is located about 80 km northeast of&#13;
Ashuganj, near the recently completed North-South pipeline. Discovered in&#13;
1960, no activity was undertaken at this field until 1989, when two appraisal&#13;
wells (later completed as production wells) were drilled and workover of two&#13;
existing wells was carried out under the SGDP. The drilling results indicate&#13;
the drilled area contains some 2.2 TCF of proven gas reserve and constitutes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Bangladesh's fourth largest gas accumulation, after Titas, Kailashtilla and&#13;
Habiganj. The field has two gas-bearing zones; the lower zone contains a&#13;
moderate amount of condensate. Two separate gas processing schemes are&#13;
adopted for the four wells completed under the SGDP: the upper zone with&#13;
dehydration (water removal) only, using a simple liquid desiccant glycol&#13;
process; the lower zone with dehydration and condensate recovery, using a more&#13;
complex process with dry desiccant silica gel. The glycol plant (60 MMCFD)&#13;
was commissioned in December 1993. Since the commission of the silica gel&#13;
plant (70 MMCFD) in March 1994, all four wells have been into production.&#13;
4.6       To meet the impending gas supply shortfall, Petrobangla needs to&#13;
commission at least 300 MMCPD of additional gas supply capacity by FY98-99.&#13;
The choice of Rashidpur field as one of the three primary sources for capacity&#13;
addition (the other two being Habiganj and Kailashtilla) was made after a&#13;
careful field-by-field review, taking into account reserve availability,&#13;
infrastructure requirements, and construction lead time. The three wells to&#13;
be drilled at Rashidpur would produce 622 BCF of gas and 149,000 tons of&#13;
condensate over a 20-year period, and would firm up additional reserve&#13;
estimates for the field.  A 90 MMCFD capacity silica gel plant is proposed to&#13;
dehydrate and process gas from the new wells. The drilling, completion and&#13;
tie-in of three wells, and construction of the proposed gas treatment plant&#13;
are estimated to cost US$ 47.7 million (30% of the total project cost).&#13;
Technical Assistance (US$ 24.9 million)&#13;
4.7       Technical assistance provided under the project will assist the&#13;
Petrobangla group as detailed below.&#13;
4.8       Proiect Imnlementation SuvDort (GTCL and SGFL).  In view of the&#13;
current limitations of GTCL and SGFL, project engineering and implementation&#13;
support consultancy services will be provided through resident experts. These&#13;
experts will assist in preparation of component specifications, engineering&#13;
design and bidding documents, bid evaluation, contract execution and&#13;
construction supervision. Altogether, some 300 consultant-months of&#13;
expatriate consultants' services would be provided through the project&#13;
implementation period. To ensure know-how transfer through active&#13;
participation in the above tasks, terms of reference for the above&#13;
consultancies include counterpart training requirements.&#13;
4.9       Twinning (GTCL).  To assist the newly formed GTCL in establishing&#13;
appropriate organization structure and mantagement systems and building up its&#13;
capability commensurate with the operation of a modern gas utility, broad-&#13;
based technical and management support is required. The project will finance&#13;
a twinning arrangement between GTCL and a mature foreign gas operating entity.&#13;
It is intended that the twinning partner identify itself fully with the needs&#13;
of GTCL and provide GTCL with continuing services, advice and experienced&#13;
personnel over a number of years to the point where GTCL can independently and&#13;
efficiently carry out its operations. To enhance the effectiveness of&#13;
twinning in the transfer of managerial and technical skills and systems, the&#13;
proposed twinning anticipates a direct operational involvement of the foreign&#13;
partner through placing a team of expatriate personnel into line management&#13;
positions who will, together with GTCL's top management, have joint&#13;
responsibility for overseeing day-to-day operations and implementation of&#13;
systems, procedures and practices. Agreed terms of reference are given in&#13;
Annex 4.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
4.10      Environmental and Safety Management (Petrobanrla Groun).  Given&#13;
that the Petrobangla group currently has no well-defined safety engineering&#13;
standards and environmental regulation, nor does it have an adequate&#13;
institutional framework and capability to properly administer the safety and&#13;
environmental aspects of its operations, the project provides technical&#13;
assistance to help it (a) develop adequate safety standards and environmental&#13;
protection rules for its entire operations, and (b) implement a group-wide&#13;
environmental and safety management system. Agreed terms of reference are&#13;
given in Annex 4.2.&#13;
4.11      Reservoir Management.  Under the SGDP, consultants were engaged to&#13;
carry out reservoir studies of six gas fields and provide training to&#13;
Petrobangla group staff in the areas of field management and production&#13;
planning. The above technical assistance was instrumental in the&#13;
establishment of the Reservoir Engineering Department at Petrobangla.&#13;
Notwithstanding the positive results obtained to date, the paucity of&#13;
reservoir information, resulting from inadequate monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
the performance of each producing well due to the lack of an integrated&#13;
program for pressure testing/monitoring and shortage of trained staff,&#13;
continues to be a major constraint to the optimal development of the country's&#13;
hydrocarbon endowment. To address this situation, the project includes&#13;
provision of state of the art reservoir management tools and consultancy&#13;
services to assist in the development and implementation of a comprehensive&#13;
pressure testing program.&#13;
4.12      Management System ImDrovement Proaram (Petrobanqla Group).  To&#13;
improve the timeliness and accuracy of financial reporting for better&#13;
operational control and planning, a management system improvement program&#13;
(MSIP) will be implemented under the project. The MSIP provides for the&#13;
group-wide implementation of (i) improvements in accounting and financial&#13;
policies and procedures, (ii) improvements in the management information&#13;
systems; (iii) a program of computerization; and (iv) a related program of&#13;
staff training. Agreed terms of reference are given in Annex 4.2.&#13;
4.13      Training (Petrobanqla GrouD).  To assist the Petrobangla group&#13;
develop its staff capabilities to properly operate and maintain a growing gas&#13;
supply system, a program providing a total of 300 staff-months of training&#13;
would be implemented under the project. The program will complement the&#13;
training to be provided under the twinning, MSIP and environmental and safety&#13;
management consultancies, and will cover training needs in geophysics,&#13;
geology, well drilling, well completion, gas treatment processes, gas&#13;
transmission system management, and safety engineering. Annex 4.3 outlines&#13;
the priority areas of training. Petrobangla will prepare and furnish to IDA&#13;
for review a detailed training program identifying staff to be trained in each&#13;
area, proposed hosting organizations, schedules and locations. A 3-4 year&#13;
timeframe is envisaged for the program.&#13;
C. Status of Prolect Preparation&#13;
4.14      The project is at an advanced stage of preparation.  A contract for&#13;
the turnkey construction of the A-B pipeline has been awarded in accordance&#13;
with IDA's procurement guidelines. Land acquisition and requisition for the&#13;
A-B pipeline has been completed and GTCL has taken legal possession of the&#13;
land required. The consultant for the A-B pipeline construction supervision&#13;
was appointed in June 1994 in accordance with IDA guidelines. TORs and shortlists&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
for all other consultancy services to be financed under the proposed credit&#13;
(except for the training program) were agreed and proposals invited, which are&#13;
now under evaluation.   Regarding the SCADA/pipeline telecommunication&#13;
component to be implemented with ODA financing, preparation work to define the&#13;
scope, system configuration and cost estimate has been completed with the&#13;
assistance of ODA-financed consultant; the implementation management&#13;
consultant will be mobilized in April to prepare detailed design and bid&#13;
documents for the turnkey contract construction of this component.&#13;
D. Environmental and Safety Aspects&#13;
4.15      The proposed project is a category A project under IDA's&#13;
Operational Directive for environmental screening. TOR for the Environmental&#13;
and Safety Assessment (ESA) of the project were prepared jointly by&#13;
Petrobangla and IDA. The ESA was carried out by Petrobangla with the&#13;
assistance of international consultants. As part of the environmental&#13;
assessment process, a comprehensive baseline data acquisition program for the&#13;
project area was carried out during July 1993 - July 1994; this provides a&#13;
sound basis for future environmental mitigation and monitoring. Annex 4.4&#13;
provides the summary of the ESA report.&#13;
4.16      The proposed project would have significant environmental benefits.&#13;
Increased gas supply and utilization would reduce consumption of liquid&#13;
petroleum products and fuelwood, wnich would in turn reduce emission of SO2&#13;
and CO2, and alleviate the pressure on deforestation. Gas produced from known&#13;
fields contains no sulphur. Furthermore, gas used in combined-cycle power&#13;
plants -- the typical technology for generation capacity addition, emits only&#13;
half as much CO2 as a oil-fired power plant.  The reduction in Co2 emission&#13;
offers a highly effective response to the greenhouse effect.&#13;
4.17      Potential significant negative environmental impacts include: (a)&#13;
surface/ground water contamination which may be caused by improper handling of&#13;
wastes from well drilling sites, process facilities and the A-B pipeline&#13;
during both the construction and operational phases; and (b) soil erosion&#13;
which may arise from the construction of the A-B pipeline. The ESA report&#13;
fully addresses these potential impacts and recommends appropriate mitigation&#13;
actions. The pipeline route has been selected based on the criterion of&#13;
minimizing involuntary resettlement. Directional drilling underneath the&#13;
river beds would be used for river crossing in order to eliminate impact on&#13;
river flow regimes and fish habitat. Location of drilling well sites and&#13;
surface facilities would be chosen to minimize land requirement and&#13;
degradation. The entire project design and construction would conform with&#13;
international engineering and safety standards as well as sound environmental&#13;
management practices. Based on the results of an already completed soil&#13;
survey, a topsoil restoration program would be executed by the pipeline&#13;
contractor along the pipeline route.&#13;
4.18      The safety aspect of gas transmission, distribution and storage is&#13;
regulated by Bangladesh's existing law, i.e., the 1991 Natural Gas Safety&#13;
Rules. However, the lack of adequate formal, uniform standards and technical&#13;
procedures within the Petrobangla group tends to inhibit the effectiveness of&#13;
the above legislation. As part of the environment and safety assessment, a&#13;
team of experts from British Gas was engaged in August 1993 to carry out a&#13;
safety audit of the group's entire operations. The audit concludes that all&#13;
operating companies are generally operating an adequate system. Nevertheless,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
to properly manage potential hazards associated with a growing gas network,&#13;
the audit recommends that Petrobangla:&#13;
(a) adopt a common set of safety standards and codes that are&#13;
comprehensive, up-to-date and are disseminated to managers and&#13;
supervisors;&#13;
(b) carry out technical audits of existing facilities and systems to&#13;
ensure their compliance with the requirements of the 1991 Gas&#13;
Safety Rules;&#13;
(c) adopt common emergency response procedures; and&#13;
(d) provide formal and certificated training for managers, supervisors&#13;
and operatives particularly with regard to Ci) regulator design,&#13;
operation and maintenance; (ii) pipeline maintenance; (iii) leak&#13;
detection and pipeline surveillance; and (iv) corrosion prevention.&#13;
These recommendations have been incorporated in the terms of reference for the&#13;
environmental and safety management technical assistance to be implemented&#13;
under the project.&#13;
4.19      Notwithstanding its good operational safety records and its&#13;
commitment to adhere to the laws issued by the Government for the protection&#13;
of the national environment and the health and safety of its employees,&#13;
consumers and the general public, as manifested in the December 15, 1992&#13;
Environmental and Safety Policy Statement, the Petrobangla group currently has&#13;
no well-defined safety engineering standards and environmental regulation, nor&#13;
does it have an adequate institutional framework and capability to properly&#13;
administer the safety and environmental aspects of its operations.&#13;
Recognizing the critical need to address this deficiency, Petrobangla has&#13;
recently created an Environment and Safety Division which would serve as the&#13;
focal point for coordinating among all operating companies (i) development and&#13;
dissemination of a comprehensive set of safety standards and environmental&#13;
protection rules, and (ii) implementation of an environmental and safety&#13;
management system. Technical assistance will be provided under the proposed&#13;
project to help Petrobangla develop and implement a group-wide environmental&#13;
and safety management program, including the implementation of a sound&#13;
monitoring system (para. 4.10).&#13;
E. Land Acauisition and Resettlement&#13;
4.20      Bangladesh is administratively divided into districts which are&#13;
subdivided into thanas and further into unions. The project area totals about&#13;
17.5 km2, involving three districts -- Habiganj District where the Rashidpur&#13;
gas field is located, and the Brahmanbaria and Comilla Districts through which&#13;
the A-B pipeline is routed. About 60% of the project area is under&#13;
cultivation throughout the year.&#13;
4.21      Construction of the A-B pipeline would require permanent&#13;
acquisition of a 10-meter wide strip for pipeline right of way and temporary&#13;
requisition of a 15-meter wide strip for construction purposes. IDA is&#13;
generally satisfied with the effort made by Petrobangla to minimize&#13;
involuntary resettlement in selecting the pipeline route. Population&#13;
displacement by the A-B pipeline is very limited, involving twelve households;&#13;
the amount of land acquired per owner is very small. Land acquisition (about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
5S hectares) and requisition (about 91 hectares) has been completed. In the&#13;
Rashidpur area, the main land ownership rests with GOB (the Ministry of&#13;
Forestry). The new gas processing plant will utilize the existing acquired&#13;
site. To minimize taking of land for the drilling operation, directional&#13;
drilling will be adopted wherever practical, and use of a single common&#13;
drilling operations camp and closed drilling systems will be specified in the&#13;
drilling contract. Land required for the drilling sites would not exceed&#13;
1.5 hectares. Existing access roads and pipeline rights-of-way will be used&#13;
wherever possible to minimize impact of road construction.&#13;
4.22      Affected landowners are compensated as per recorded land value plus&#13;
a SOW premium as per the 1993 Amendment to the 1982 Acquisition and&#13;
Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance. In addition, affected farmers&#13;
are compensated for loss of crops according to the current market prices.&#13;
Assurance has been given by Petrobangla that, as per its practice, the&#13;
affected land owners have the additional benefit of cultivating the land&#13;
acquired by Petrobangla after the completion of pipeline construction except&#13;
for the periods for emergency and/or maintenance work.&#13;
4.23      Taking the lessons of experience from the construction of the&#13;
North-South pipeline, Petrobangla has recognized the need to improve the&#13;
information provided to the people affected by the project (PAPs) and for&#13;
monitoring of the compensation and land acquisition/requisition process.&#13;
Specifically, Petrobangla, with the assistance of a local consultant, has&#13;
undertaken the following steps:&#13;
On information/consultation:&#13;
(a) establish Public Consultation and Grievance Committees at thana&#13;
level. The role of the committees is to hear any grievances of&#13;
PAPs, including sharecroppers, and bring the matter to the&#13;
appropriate authority (District Commissioners or Petrobangla).&#13;
Each Committee would have one representative from the affected&#13;
communities, one appointed by the District authorities and one from&#13;
Petrobangla. The Committees would hold their meetings close to the&#13;
affected areas, according to a timetable announced well in advance;&#13;
(b)  prepare and distribute brochures explaining the project, the&#13;
commitments of Petrobangla in assisting affected people, and the&#13;
grievance mechanism;&#13;
(c)  issue separate notices of eviction at least four months prior to&#13;
the contractor being given possession of the land;&#13;
On compensation:&#13;
(d)  arrange with District Commissioners (DCs) for retroactive payment&#13;
of a full 50% premium on the compensation for loss of land (i.e.,&#13;
payment of an additional 30t premium);&#13;
(e)  compile records of the names of all affected property owners, based&#13;
on the files of the DCs. Information on lost properties,&#13;
compensation amount, and compensation received will be recorded.&#13;
The database will be made available to the Public Consultation and&#13;
Grievance Committees;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
(f) carry out a complete registration of all households subject to&#13;
relocation and assist them, on a case-by-case basis, in finding&#13;
replacement homestead land;&#13;
(g) postpone auctioning of acquired houses to the greatest extent&#13;
possible, to allow the households concerned maximum time for&#13;
relocation; and&#13;
(h) announce that a person is entitled to his/her full compensation&#13;
before vacating the acquired property. Petrobangla will actively&#13;
assist those persons who has problems in getting their&#13;
compensation.&#13;
F.  Prolect Costs&#13;
4.24      The total cost of the project, including price and physical&#13;
contingencies, duties and taxes, is estimated at US$ 161.6 million, with a&#13;
foreign exchange component of US$ 120.1 million. Duties and taxes would&#13;
amount to about US$ 8.9 million. Project base costs are at mid-1994 price&#13;
level.. Physical contingencies are included at 10% of base cost. Price&#13;
contingencies for foreign costs are based on an average annual price increase&#13;
of 2.5% for 1995-2000. Price contingencies for local costs are based on&#13;
projected annual inflation rate of 4% for FY95-97, 4.5% for FY98-99, and 5%&#13;
for FY2000. Purchasing power parity is assumed for exchange rate changes over&#13;
the life of the project. Total price contingencies amount to 6% of the base&#13;
cost plus physical contingencies. Project cost estimates are summarized in&#13;

G. Proiect Financing and Terms&#13;
4.25           The total financing required, including interest during&#13;
construction, would amount to US$ 171.7 million. The proposed IDA credit of&#13;
US$ 120.8 million would finance 85% of the project's foreign cost and 56' of&#13;
the local cost, covering about 79% of the total project cost net of duties and&#13;
taxes. ODA will provide US$ 26.9 million equivalent in grant financing for&#13;
the SCADA/telecommunication component and the MSIP technical assistance. The&#13;
remaining local cost financing requirement of US$ 24.0 million equivalent&#13;
would be met by GTCL (US$ 5.0 million), SGFL (US$ 7.7 million), and GOB's&#13;
equity contribution tb GTCL (US$ 11.3 million) I/ Table 4.2 summarizes the&#13;

the proposed credit) for expenditures incurred after July 1, 1994 is provided&#13;
for the A-B pipeline turnkey construction and supervision consultancy&#13;
contracts; advance contracting for the same totals about US$ 50 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
4.27      The proposed IDA credit would be provided to GOB on standard IDA&#13;
terms. GOB would onlend the proceeds of the credit to GTCL, SGFL and&#13;
Petrobangla under three separate Subsidiary Loan Agreements (SLAs) at a rate&#13;
of 8t p.a., repayable over fifteen years, including five years of grace, with&#13;
GTCL/SGFL/Petrobangla bearing the foreign exchange risk. Based on the spread&#13;
between the projected increases in international prices and local inflation&#13;
rates and assuming purchasing power parity, the effective annual interest rate&#13;
is expected to reach 16% by 1999, compared with the weighted average interest&#13;
rate on domestic commercial bank advances of 14.5t p.a. in March 1993. The&#13;
signing of SLAs between GOB and GTCL/SGFL/Petrobangla under terms and&#13;
conditions acceptable to IDA and signature of the ODA grant agreement are&#13;
conditions of credit effectiveness.&#13;

4.29      Goods. Works and Technical Services.  Procurement of materials,&#13;
equipment, services and works to be financed under the proposed credit would&#13;
be carried out in accordance with IDA's procurement guidelines, using IDA's&#13;
standard bid documents for procurement under ICB and local bid documents&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Detailed procurement arrangements are given in Annex 4.5.&#13;
International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures would be followed for most&#13;
of the project's procurement, and about 75% of the proposed credit amount&#13;
would be disbursed against ICB procurement. There would be six ICB packages&#13;
with an estimated total value of about US$ 100 million, comprising: (a) two&#13;
turnkey construction contracts for the A-B pipeline (US$ 63.3 million) and gas&#13;
processing plant (US$ 23.9 million), respectively; (b) three supply packages&#13;
for tubulars (US$ 5.2 million), fluid chemicals (US$ 1.3 million), and oilwell&#13;
cement (US$ 1.2 million); and (c) charter hire of one drilling rig to drill&#13;
three wells at the Rashidpur field (US$ 5.0 million).&#13;
4.30      Highly specialized materials, equipment and services, available&#13;
from only a small number of suppliers and contractors would be procured under&#13;
limited international bidding (LIB) procedures. There would be ten LIB&#13;
packages, with an estimated aggregate value of US$ 8.5 million, covering: (a)&#13;
supply of drilling and coring bits (US$ 1.4 million), wellheads (US$ 1.3&#13;
million), downhole completion equipment (US$ 1.8 million), casing accessories&#13;
(US$ 0.3 million), drilling fluid additives (US$ 0.3 million), oilwell cement&#13;
additives (US$ 0.2 million), wellhead fittings (US$ 0.2 million); (b) three&#13;
service contracts for electric well-logging (US$ 1.5 million), well cementing&#13;
and production testing (US$ 1.0 million), and drilling mud (US$ 0.5 million);&#13;
and (c) emergency response equipment (US$ 2.5 million). Under LIB procedures,&#13;
bids would be invited from a list of potential suppliers broad enough to&#13;
ensure competitive prices, without open advertisement.&#13;
4.31      Proprietary spare parts and items for some of the existing field&#13;
servicing units and laboratories up to an aggregate amount of US$ 1.3 million&#13;
wouuld be procured from sole source through direct negotiations. Construction&#13;
and maintenance of the three well drilling location pads along with their&#13;
access roads, estimated to cost US$ 1.8 million, would be packaged in one&#13;
contract and procured under local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The contract involves labor-intensive work, and is unlikely to attract&#13;
the attention of foreign bidders. However, foreign bidders would be allowed&#13;
to bid if they so desire.&#13;
4.32      Local bidders participating in ICB for supply of goods would&#13;
receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the CIF price or the&#13;
prevailing customs duty applicable to nonexempt importers, whichever is less.&#13;
For contracts for works to be awarded on the basis of ICB, a margin of&#13;
preference of 7.5% would be granted to eligible domestic contractors. No&#13;
domestic preference would be applicable to procurement under LIB procedures.&#13;
4.33      Consultancv Services and Training.  Consultancy services financed&#13;
by IDA would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency&#13;
(August 1981), including use of the Bank's Standard Form of Contract for&#13;
Consultants' Services. Selection of consultants for all assignments,&#13;
including the GTCL twinning arrangement, would be from a shortlist agreed by&#13;
IDA and under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA. Specialized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
institutions will be engaged to implement the agreed training program,&#13;
following procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
4.34      All goods and technical services contracts valued US$ 200,000 or&#13;
more, works contracts US$ 300,000 or more, consulting firm contracts US$&#13;
100,000 or more, and individual consultant contracts US$ 50,000 or more will&#13;
be subject to prior review by IDA. This would cover about 90' of procurement&#13;
financed under the proposed credit.&#13;
4.35      Procurement of goods and services financed by ODA would follow the&#13;
cofinancier's procurement guidelines.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
4.36      Disbursement from the proposed credit would be made against:&#13;
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures and 100% of local expenditures (ex-&#13;
factory cost) for goods procured through ICB, LIB and direct&#13;
purchase, and 70% of local expenditures for items procured locally;&#13;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures and 75% of local expenditures for&#13;
turnkey construction of the A-B pipeline and gas processing plant;&#13;
(c) 100% of total expenditure for well drilling and completion&#13;
services;&#13;
(d) 70% of total expenditures for civil works procured locally; and&#13;
(e) 100% of total expenditure for consultancy services and training.&#13;
4.37      To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account in US dollars would&#13;
be established for the proposed credit with an authorized allocation of US$ 5&#13;
million, estimated on the basis of four months' average expenditures. All&#13;
disbursements would be made following standard IDA documentation requirements,&#13;
except for contracts valued at US$ 100,000 equivalent or less per contract for&#13;
goods, well drilling services, civil works, and consulting services (firms&#13;
only) and individual consultant contracts valued at US$ 50,000 equivalent or&#13;
less per contract for which Statement of Expenditures (SOE) procedures would&#13;
be used. Project beneficiaries would retain detailed documentation supporting&#13;
SOEs for inspection by IDA's supervision missions.&#13;
4.38      The disbursement profile shown in Annex 4.6 is based on completion&#13;
of the proposed project by June 30, 1999. The credit closing date will be&#13;
June 30, 2000. The total disbursement period for the project is expected to&#13;
be about 5.5 years after credit approval.&#13;
I. Prolect Implementation&#13;
4.39      Project implementation responsibilities rest with GTCL for the A-B&#13;
pipeline, SCADA/telecommunication and twinning, with SGFL for the Rashidpur&#13;
field development, and with Petrobangla for the environmental and safety&#13;
technical assistance, reservoir management, MSIP and training program. The&#13;
project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4.7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
4.40      Physical Works.  Implementation arrangements for the project's&#13;
physical works builds on the lessons learned from previous projects and&#13;
project entities' current limitations. Four project managers have been&#13;
appointed, one each for the A-B pipeline, SCADA, drilling and gas processing&#13;
components. The A-B pipeline, SCADA/telecommunication system, and gas&#13;
processing plant would be constructed on a turnkey contract basis.&#13;
Consultants from reputable international engineering firms will be engaged to&#13;
assist the project implementation units of GTCL/SGFL in carrying out bid&#13;
evaluation and construction supervision. To minimize risk of delay in the&#13;
project's physical start-up, the signing of the A-B pipeline construction&#13;
contract and appointment of supervisory consultants for the Rashidpur field&#13;
development drilling and associated gas processing plant are conditions of&#13;
credit effectiveness.&#13;
4.41      Petrobangla Group's Capacitv Buildina.  For the environmental and&#13;
safety TA, Petrobangla's Environment and Safety Division will serve as the key&#13;
counterpart to the team of international and local consultants and will be&#13;
responsible for coordinating among all operating companies the implementation&#13;
of a group-wide environmental and safety management system; the Reservoir&#13;
Engineering Department at Petrobangla will be responsible for implementing the&#13;
reservoir management TA; the office of the Director of Finance, Petrobangla,&#13;
will oversee the implementation of the MSIP; and Petrobangla's Training&#13;
Department will administer the delivery of the agreed training program.&#13;
Implementation of the above technical assistance is scheduled to commence by&#13;
October 1995.&#13;
J.  Proiect Monitoring and Sunervision&#13;
4.42      The frequency and format of project reporting requirements (Annex&#13;
4.8) were discussed and agreed with project beneficiaries during negotiations.&#13;
During project implementation, GTCL/SGFL/Petrobangla will report progress on&#13;
the various physical and institutional components of the project through&#13;
quarterly progress reports and on the financial performance through annual&#13;
financial statements. GOB will furnish to IDA not later than six months after&#13;
the end of each fiscal year the auditor's report on withdrawals made on the&#13;
basis of statements of expenditures and from the Special Account. Within four&#13;
months of the project closing date, GTCL/SGFL/Petrobangla will prepare and&#13;
furnish to IDA a Project Implementation Completion Report of such scope and in&#13;
such detail as IDA shall reasonably request, on the execution and initial&#13;
operation of the project, its costs and the benefits derived from it, the&#13;
accomplishment of the objectives of the credit, the plan for the project's&#13;
future operation and the lessons learned.&#13;
4.43      The consultants employed for implementing various technical&#13;
assistance assignments provided under the project will submit monthly reports&#13;
comparing actual progress against agreed performance indicators to respective&#13;
project implementing entities with an executive summary. A copy of the&#13;
executive summary will also be sent to IDA. On completion of their&#13;
assignments, the consultants will submit a detailed report with a copy to IDA&#13;
on their achievements of assignment objectives. These reporting requirements&#13;
are included in the terms of reference for consultancy services.&#13;
4.44      It is expected that two supervision missions per year will be&#13;
required over the life of the project, with an estimated total staff input of&#13;
64 staff-weeks. A tentative supervision plan is given in Annex 4.9. During&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
negotiations agreement was reached on (a) an annual review involving IDA, ODA&#13;
and GOB to evaluate the project implementation progress, GTCL's/SGFL's&#13;
financial performance, implementation of the sector's PIP, and GOB's progress&#13;
in carrying out further reforms in the gas sector, (b) a comprehensive mid-&#13;
term review to be carried out not later than March 31, 1997; and (c)&#13;
performance indicators against which the reviews will be carried out. The&#13;
agreed performance indicators are given in Annex 4.10.&#13;
K. Prolect Risks&#13;
4.45      The proposed project would not have any significant technical&#13;
risks. The wells are to be drilled in the known field with currently&#13;
estimated recoverable reserve sufficient to sustain the production of seven&#13;
wells for at least twenty years. Also, given that the country has sufficient&#13;
recoverable reserves to meet domestic requirements for another fifty years or&#13;
so, the risk of insufficient gas reserves to justify the pipeline investment&#13;
is minimal. The potential risks for the project fall into two categories: (a)&#13;
delays in project procurement, and (b) the Petrobangla group's limited&#13;
capability to implement the project and complementary investments in a timely&#13;
manner. These risks have been recognized and actions initiated to minimize&#13;
their impact. Adequate technical assistance is provided under the project to&#13;
assist in the implementation and construction supervision of project works.&#13;
Advance procurement actions have been initiated, and appointment of&#13;
supervisory consultants and contract award for the A-B pipeline are conditions&#13;
of credit effectiveness. To ensure balanced and timely implementation of the&#13;
sector's overall priority investment program, donor coordination will be&#13;
vigorously pursued through joint supervision missions and semi-annual&#13;
coordination meetings.&#13;
V. FINANCE&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
5.1       While the gas sector has mobilized significant amounts of revenues&#13;
for the Treasury, the Petrobangla group's past financial performance has been&#13;
marginal. GOB's excessive levy of excise on gas sales have left grossly&#13;
inadequate funds for the OCs to carry out their operations in accordance with&#13;
common industry standards and practices, and the group's ability to contribute&#13;
internal resources toward capital investments remains limited. Financing for&#13;
the group's investment program has been entirely arranged by GOB, and funds&#13;
secured were passed on to the OCs largely as loans. The pace of the sector's&#13;
future development depends on the extent of GOB's success in attracting&#13;
foreign private investment and in improving the existing sector entities'&#13;
self-financing capabilities.&#13;
B. Past Financial Performance&#13;

5.3       The most salient feature of the group's combined operations in the&#13;
period is their impressive growth.  While gas sales doubled, net fixed assets&#13;
in operation at historical value quadrupled, reflecting the large up-front&#13;
cost for development of the gas fields and transmission/distribution&#13;
infrastructure. Even more impressive is the growth in the group's&#13;
contribution to the Treasury, which increased from Tk 2.0 billion in FY86 to&#13;
Tk 7.4 billion in FY93, reflecting the combined results of an average annual&#13;
growth of 10% and 11t, respectively, achieved in the gas sales and average gas&#13;
tariff. However, GOB's excessive levy of excise on gas sales has seriously&#13;
affected the group's financial position. The group's operations during the&#13;
period were characterized by (a) low earning capacity, (b) dependence on&#13;
external sources to finance investment, and (c) inadequate collections.&#13;
5.4       Low Earning CaDacitv.  Since its inception, the Petrobangla group&#13;
has been operated like a direct extension of the Government. This management&#13;
philosophy is reflected in GOB's policy on excise duty levied on gas sales.&#13;
During FY86-90, excise duty was at a level exceeding 75% of gas sales revenue,&#13;
a situation unprecedented elsewhere. As a result, the OCs' combined rate of&#13;
return on historically valued net fixed assets in operation was around or&#13;
below 8% during the period. Although the reduction in GOB's take to about 62%&#13;
in FY91 helped to increase the OCs' combined rate of return to around 12% in&#13;
FY91-93, internally generated funds were insufficient to provide a significant&#13;
level of self-financing after meeting debt service and other mandatory&#13;
outlays. The shortage of funds resulted in absence of proper maintenance of&#13;
the group's facilities. This is an area where corrective action is critically&#13;
required to prevent potentially serious safety hazards and damage to assets.&#13;
5.5       Financing of Investment.  During the period, internal cash&#13;
generation of the five OCs totalled Tk 12.0 billion, 68% of which was&#13;
earmarked for debt service. As shown in Table 5.2, the OCs financed about 70%&#13;
of their investment requirements by borrowing. GOB provided a total of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Tk 21.0 billion or about 92% of total investment requirements, about three&#13;
quarters of it passed as loans and the balance as equity contribution.&#13;

5.6       Collections.  Under the SGDP, Petrobangla was required to ensure&#13;
that OCs' accounts receivable would not exceed three months of gas sales. As&#13;
of March 31, 1994, total accounts receivable was equivalent to 3.2 months'&#13;
billings. The three categories of consumers with arrears exceeding three&#13;
months as of March 31, 1994 were: private consumers (34% of total accounts&#13;
receivable and 4.0 months' billings; public sector consumers, excluding power&#13;
and fertilizer (17% of total and 21.8 months' billings); and Bangladesh&#13;
Petroleum Corporation (9% of total and 4.6 months' billings). While aggregate&#13;
accounts receivable from BPDB and BCIC are now maintained at a level equal to&#13;
two months of billings, the backlog of arrears from sales of gas to the&#13;
fertilizer plant at Fenchuganj and the Shahaji Bazar power station has&#13;
negatively impacted on JGTDSL's, and hence SGFL's, accounts receivable&#13;
position. During negotiations, it was agreed that GOB will cause to be&#13;
carried out a program satisfactory to IDA to clear public sector consumers'&#13;
arrears for gas and condensates supplied by the gas operating companies.&#13;
Svlhet Gas Fields Limited (SGFL)&#13;
5.7       SGFL is the oldest gas production company in Bangladesh.&#13;
Presently, gas is produced from three gas fields, i.e., Kailashtilla, Sylhet&#13;
and Rashidpur, with average daily production of about 110 MMCFD of gas and 255&#13;
BBL/day of associated condensates. The company is also producing oil from a&#13;
single well in Sylhet at the rate of 240 BBL per day. Although gas sales&#13;
remained stagnant during the period FY86-93, SGFL had maintained a profitable&#13;
position, primarily due to the proceeds of its sales of oil and condensates&#13;
which have a much lower excise duty than natural gas. As shown in Table 5.3,&#13;
at the end of FY93, SGFL had a satisfactory financial position. Its long term&#13;
debt was 45% of its capital structure, and its current ratio of 2.6 was in&#13;
striking contrast with the position of other OCs. The return on average net&#13;
historical fixed assets was around or above 50% during FY89-93, reflecting the&#13;
fact that the company had benefitted from having a small, old asset base.&#13;

C. Financial Outlook&#13;
5.8      Financial Obiectives.  To promote efficient and self-sustaining&#13;
development of the gas sector, and to mobilize private capital, it is&#13;
essential that the gas sector entities be operated on a commercial basis with&#13;
clearly defined financial objectives in that revenues generated and retained&#13;
by the OCs cover operating expenses, debt service requirements, an adequate&#13;
provision of working capital, and a reasonable portion of their investment&#13;
requirements. To improve the gas production, transmission and distribution&#13;
OCs' finances and to pave the way for private entry, it was confirmed during&#13;
negotiations that GOB will take all necessary actions, including authorization&#13;
of adjustments to gas tariffs and GOB's excise duty, to enable: (a) BGFCL,&#13;
SGFL, TGTDC, BGSL and JGTDSL to self-finance a minimum of 20-30% of their&#13;
respective investment programs after meeting debt service and provision of&#13;
working capital; and (b) GTCL to achieve at least break-even during the life&#13;
of the project.&#13;
5.9       Investment Proqram.  According to the gas sector's priority&#13;
investment program (para. 2.11), GTCL's and SGFL's investments during FY95-&#13;
2000 are estimated at US$ 177 million and US$ 167 million in 1994 prices,&#13;
respectively, representing about 29% and 27% of the overall PIP. If the two&#13;
production sharing contracts referred to in para. 2.17 are successfully&#13;
implemented, investments taken up by the private sector would partially&#13;
replace or postpone the need for capacity addition at the Kailashtilla field,&#13;
thus reducing SGFL's overall investment requirement during the forecast&#13;
period. Besides the A-B pipeline and the SCADA/telecommunication system,&#13;
GTCL's investment program includes the 20,000 BHP capacity Ashuganj compressor&#13;
station (US$ 25 million) and the Habiganj-Ashuganj loopline (US$ 44 million),&#13;
which will be required to increase the capacity of the North-South pipeline&#13;
for FY99 and beyond.&#13;
5.10      Financial Proiections.  Based on the sales growth, investment&#13;
levels and self-financing targets discussed above and other assumptions set&#13;
out in Annex 5.3, pro forma financial statements for SGFL and GTCL for FY95-&#13;
&#13;

5.11      SGFL.  During the projection period, SGFL is expected to grow&#13;
significantly. The commissioning of the investments constructed under SGDP,&#13;
together with planned addition of supply capacity at Rashidpur and&#13;
Kailashtilla (7 X 30 MMCFD), would bring its annual sales from the level of 23&#13;
BCFin FY94 to 103 BCF by FY98, a five-fold increase. Given the assumed margin&#13;
increases, the financial projections indicate that SGFL would produce&#13;
acceptable financial results. Despite the large increase in the size of asset&#13;
base, the rate of return on net fixed assets in use would be around 15% on&#13;
average. Cash flows from gas sales would develop to enable SGFL to achieve an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
average self-financing ratio of about 25% 2/ and debt service would be&#13;
covered a minimum of 1.5 times throughout the period. However, SGFL's future&#13;
performance is sensitive to the timely implementation of tariff adjustments.&#13;
To ensure adequate internal resource generation and SGFL's financial&#13;
viability, agreement was reached with GOB/SGFL during negotiations that all&#13;
necessary actions will be taken to enable SGFL to: (a) achieve a minimum of&#13;
15% annual rate of return on its average net fixed assets in operation; (b)&#13;
maintain its accounts receivable from the sales of gas and condensates at a&#13;
level not exceeding the equivalent of three months' billings; and (c) maintain&#13;
a debt/equity ratio of not greater than 70/30.&#13;
5.12      Given the debt service burden associated with the large investment&#13;
costs of the North-South pipeline (Tk 5.6 billion or US$ 140 million&#13;
equivalent) and the timeframe required for the utilization of the new capacity&#13;
to build up, it is realized that during FY95-98 GTCL will be unable to provide&#13;
any meaningful self-financing for the A-B pipeline and SCADA components after&#13;
meeting debt service. To ensure GTCL's meeting the minimum financial&#13;
performance target during the life of the project in that revenues generated&#13;
at least equal cash operating expenses and debt service, agreement was reached&#13;
with GOB/GTCL that all necessary actions will be taken to enable GTCL to: (a)&#13;
achieve a minimum annual rate of return of 4% in FY95, 6% in FY96-97, 7% in&#13;
FY98, 8% in FY99, and 10% for FY2000 and thereafter; (b) maintain accounts&#13;
receivable at a level not exceeding the equivalent of three months' billings;&#13;
and (c) maintain a debt/equity ratio of not greater than 60/40.&#13;
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Justification&#13;
6.1       The proposed project's physical investments are the most urgent&#13;
components of the gas sector's priority investment program (PIP). The PIP,&#13;
estimated to cost about US$ 600 million in 1994 prices, is a minimal set of&#13;
least cost investments required to achieve supply and demand balance around&#13;
FY98. The PIP was discussed with Petrobangla during project appraisal and the&#13;
justification for all its components was confirmed. About 54% of the required&#13;
investment would be for development of new wells and construction of&#13;
associated gas treatment facilities, 30% for integration and expansion of the&#13;
high pressure transmission grid. The PIP would be updated and reviewed with&#13;
IDA and other donors on an annual basis to take account of changes in the gas&#13;
demand and investments taken up by the private sector (para. 2.11).&#13;
6.2       As discussed in para.2.10, current gas demand during the peak hours&#13;
is already outstripping the supply capacity. Projected demand and supply of&#13;
natural gas indicate that supply shortages would continue in the Titas and&#13;
Bakhrabad franchises through 1998 when additional supply capacity to be&#13;
constructed under the proposed project and ADB's Third Natural Gas Development&#13;
Project is expected to come on stream. To increase the supply of gas as early&#13;
as possible, thereby minimizing the cost to the economy, development of new&#13;
capacity at the Rashidpur, Habiganj and Titas gas fields and integration of&#13;
?J excluding the investments constructed under SGDP to be transferred to SGFCL with a debt/equity ratio of&#13;
70/30.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
the two transmission subsystems via the A-B pipeline represent the optimal&#13;
solution.&#13;
B. Proiect Benefits&#13;
6.3       Benefits would include increased availability and improved&#13;
reliability of gas supply, and resource savings from substitution of gas for&#13;
imported alternative fuels, particularly for power generation. The&#13;
institutional support would bring about sustained improvement in Petrobangla&#13;
group's operational safety and asset maintenance. The project would also&#13;
contribute towards mitigating the impact of energy use on the quality of the&#13;
environment.&#13;
C. Economic Rate of Return&#13;
6.4       While the proposed project constitutes an important part of the&#13;
PIP, its benefits to consumers are not readily separable from those of other&#13;
least cost investments in the PIP, as the A-B pipeline, the project's&#13;
principal component, is geared to provide a transportation link for the new&#13;
production capacity included in the PIP. In these circumstances, it is&#13;
appropriate to carry out the cost-benefit analysis of the sector's entire&#13;
investment program to ensure that it is justified. For this purpose, the&#13;
capital costs of the investment program for the period FY95-2000, together&#13;
with the incremental operating and maintenance costs associated with the&#13;
investment program, are compared with the economic benefit of the investment&#13;
program. All costs are expressed in terms of their equivalent border values.&#13;
A minimum measure of the economic benefit associated with the investment&#13;
program is represented by incremental sales revenue. On this basis, the rate&#13;
of return is estimated to be 23%. Sensitivity analysis based on the first&#13;
slice of the PIP, for which financing has been secured, yields a rate of&#13;
return of around 19%. Details of the analysis are given in Annex 6.1.&#13;
6.5       The foregoing revenue-based measure of rate of return is, by its&#13;
nature, more a measure of the adequacy of prevailing tariffs than of the true&#13;
economic merit of the investment program which includes the proposed project.&#13;
A better measure of the rate of return can be obtained using the international&#13;
price of fuel oil as a proxy for economic benefit. The ERR thus calculated is&#13;
about 33% for the entire PIP, and 30% for the first slice. A 20% increase in&#13;
capital costs would reduce the rate of return to about 29%. A lower gas sales&#13;
growth of 7% p.a. would result in a rate of return of 31%. The proposed&#13;
project is fully justified.&#13;
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1       During negotiations, GOB agreed to:&#13;
(a)  prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, jointly review with IDA&#13;
the gas sector's priority investment program, its implementation in&#13;
the current fiscal year and implementation plan for the three&#13;
succeeding fiscal years (para. 2.11);&#13;
(b)  by December 31, 1995, carry out a joint review with IDA of its&#13;
action plan for strengthening the institutional and regulatory&#13;
frameworks for the petroleum/gas sector (para. 2.18);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
(c) before the start of each fiscal year, review with IDA the margins&#13;
allowed to the gas operating companies in respect of such year&#13;
(para. 2.19);&#13;
(d) cause to be carried out a program satisfactory to IDA to clear&#13;
public sector consumers' arrears for gas and condensates supplied&#13;
by the gas operating companies (para. 5.6);&#13;
(e) take all necessary actions to enable: (i) the gas operating&#13;
companies to meet their financial objectives (para. 5.8); and (ii)&#13;
SGFL and GTCL to achieve specified rates of return on net fixed&#13;
assets in operation (paras. 5.11 and 5.12); and&#13;
(f) provide to IDA not later than six months after the end of each&#13;
fiscal year the auditor's report on withdrawals made on the basis&#13;
of statements of expenditures and from the Special Account (para.&#13;
4.42).&#13;
7.2       During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:&#13;
(a) GTCL/SGFL/Petrobangla will submit audited annual accounts together&#13;
with the auditor's report within six months of the end of the&#13;
fiscal year under consideration (para. 3.9);&#13;
(b) Petrobangla will commence, by October 1, 1995, the implementation&#13;
of the environmental and safety technical assistance, MSIP, and the&#13;
training program (para. 4.41);&#13;
(c) GOB/GTCL/SGFL/Petrobangla will carry out an annual project review&#13;
as well as a comprehensive mid-term review by March 31, 1997 (para.&#13;
4.44); and&#13;
(d) GTCL/SGFL will earn specified levels of rate of return on net fixed&#13;
assets in operation and maintain accounts receivable and&#13;
debt/equity ratio (paras. 5.11 and 5.12).&#13;
7.3       Prior to credit effectiveness, the following actions will be&#13;
completed:&#13;
(a) GTCL to sign the contract for the turnkey construction of the A-B&#13;
pipeline (para. 4.40);&#13;
(b) SGFL to appoint consultants for the Rashidpur drilling and&#13;
associated gas processing facilities components (para. 4.40);&#13;
(c) GOB, Petrobangla, GTCL, SGFL to sign subsidiary loan agreements&#13;
under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA (para. 4.27); and&#13;
(d) GOB/ODA to sign the ODA grant agreement (para. 4.27).&#13;
7.4       With the above agreements and assurances, the proposed project&#13;
constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 83.4 million (US$ 120.8&#13;
million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity to the&#13;
People's Republic of Bangladesh.&#13;

3.   Fertilizer Sector&#13;
Gas consumption by fertilizer production during the forecast period is&#13;
based on-the commissioning of the Karnaphuli fertilizer plant in FY95&#13;
(20.5 BCF p.a.) and the new Fenchuganj fertilizer plant in Jalalabad in&#13;
FY97 (il.0 BCF p.a.).&#13;
4.   Industrial. Commercial and Domestic Sectors&#13;
Given the unreliability of sectoral consumption statistics resulting&#13;
from misclassified consumption, gas consumption by the three sectors are&#13;
projected to grow at an average annual rate of 12% in Titas franchise,&#13;
9% in Bakhrabad franchise, and 10% in Jalalabad franchise, resulting in&#13;
an aggregate annual growth rate of about 10% for the three franchises&#13;
taken together. This is close to the combined, loss-adjusted growth&#13;
rate 1/ of these sectors during FY88-93.&#13;
1/  If constant percentage Losses are assumed over the 1988-93 period and the resulting additional sales&#13;
attributed to the industrial, commercial and domestic sectors, the increase in sales for these&#13;
sectors taken together wouLd have been nearly 8X&#13;

PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Background&#13;
1.        The proposed project would be IDA's third lending operation to&#13;
assist GOB in expanding the country's gas supply and delivery capacity,&#13;
following the Bakhrabad Gas Development Project (BGDP, Cr. 1091-BD, approved&#13;
in December 19R0) and the Second Gas Development Project (SGDP, Cr. 1586-BD,&#13;
approved in April 1985). With its main objective of making gas available to&#13;
consumers in the Chittagong area, the BGDP provided financing for the&#13;
development of the Bakhrabad gas field (5 wells with associated gas treatment&#13;
facilities), construction of the 177-km long, 320 MMCFD capacity Bakhrabad-&#13;
Chittagong gas transport trunkline, and the establishment of a 88-km&#13;
distribution network in and around Chittagong. The SGDP was designed to&#13;
assist in developing the large northern gas fields to cover gas supply&#13;
shortages in the Titas franchise; it consisted of appraisal and development&#13;
drilling (9 wells), installation of gas and condensate treatment facilities at&#13;
Kailashtilla and Rashidpur fields, and construction of the 170-km long, 320&#13;
MMCFD capacity Kailashtilla-Ashuganj (North-South) pipeline.  Cr. 1091-BD was&#13;
closed on December 31, 1985, and Cr. 1586-BD on December 31, 1993. Throughput&#13;
of the Bakhrabad-Chittagong pipeline was around 40 BCF in FY94 (compared with&#13;
designed throughput of 100 BCF p.a.). Throughput of the North-South pipeline&#13;
is to reach 70 BCF in FY95.&#13;
2.        The primary objective of the proposed project would be to assist in&#13;
alleviating impending gas supply shortages in the Bakhrabad franchise area&#13;
through financing development drilling at Rashidpur field and construction of&#13;
the Ashuganj-Bakhrabad (A-B) pipeline.&#13;
Prolect Comoonents&#13;
3.        To achieve the project's primary objective, the project would have&#13;
the following physical components:&#13;
(a) Drilling of three production wells with a total production of about&#13;
90 MMCFD of gas and 250 barrels per day (BBLD) of condensate at&#13;
Rashidpur gas field;&#13;
(b)  Construction of a gas processing plant to process about 90 MMCFD of&#13;
gas to pipeline quality and recover about 250 BBLD of condensate at&#13;
Rashidpur gas field;&#13;
(c) Construction of a gas pipeline, 58-km long, 30-inch diameter, from&#13;
Ashuganj to Bakhrabad (A-B pipeline), to connect the northern and&#13;
southern gas transmission subsystems; and&#13;
(d) Installation of a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)&#13;
and pipeline telecommunication system on the entire gas transport&#13;
trunkline from Kailashtilla to Chittagong to enhance the operating&#13;
efficiency of the gas network.&#13;

Rashidpur Field Production Drilling&#13;
4.        To meet impending gas supply shortfall, Petrobangla would have to&#13;
increase its production capacity by at least 300 MMCFD by FY98-99. To&#13;
determine from which field the required additional production would come, a&#13;
gas fields review in terms of reserves availability and infrastructure&#13;
requirements suggests that, although Kailashtilla field is a good candidate&#13;
for its richness in natural gas liquids (NGLs), Rashidpur field offers the&#13;
least cost option for the purpose of this project. Three production wells&#13;
would be drilled under the proposed project at Rashidpur gas field. The wells&#13;
would be completed in the Lower Sand with premium thread 4-1/2 inch size&#13;
tubing 1/. Based on commissioning of the gas processing plant by 1998, the 3&#13;
wells would yield a total production of about 622 BCF of gas and 1.8 MMBBLS of&#13;
condensate for 1998-2017 period. The wells are also expected to substantially&#13;
increase the field's resource base in terms of firming up additional gas&#13;
reserves.&#13;
5.        Discovered in 1960, some 80 km northeast of Ashuganj, near the&#13;
recently completed North-South pipeline, Rashidpur field has not, until now,&#13;
been put into production. No activity was undertaken in Rashidpur field until&#13;
1989, when two appraisal wells were drilled under the SGDP. The results&#13;
indicated that the drilled area contains more than 2 TCF of proven gas.&#13;
Rashidpur with Titas, Kailashtilla and Habiganj fields, contain altogether&#13;
about 70 percent (10.5 TCF) of the country's recoverable reserves and&#13;
constitute Bangladesh's four largest gas accumulations. Rashidpur's gas&#13;
reserves are in two separate zones, one of which contains a reasonable&#13;
quantity of condensate worth recovering. Rashidpur's gas flow rate can reach&#13;
as much as 40 MMCFD per well, but for a long-term optimum delivery, the wells&#13;
would be operated at 30 MMCFD each.  The contour maps of the two gas bearing&#13;
zones are shown in Exhibit A.&#13;
ftashidpur Gas Processing Plant&#13;
6.        Rashidpur field was known to have recoverable condensate only since&#13;
1990 when the SGDP's well results revealed that the lower of the field's two&#13;
gas bearing zones contains a moderate amount of condensate. Depending on the&#13;
performance of the process design, it is possible that between 2.3 and 3.0&#13;
BBL/MMCFD of condensate could be recovered. With each zone containing more&#13;
than 1.0 TCF of proven reserves and a good potential for additional&#13;
quantities, Rashidpur production, unlike the other fields, has been initiated&#13;
under the SGDP using two separate gas processing schemes, one for each gas&#13;
zone. The upper zone would be produced with dehydration (water removal) only&#13;
(using a simple liquid desiccant glycol process) and the lower zone with&#13;
dehydration and condensate recovery (using a more complex process with a dry&#13;
desiccant silica gel), the latter process is proposed for the project. The&#13;
plant would have 90 MMCFD capacity, with separate flowlines from each well.&#13;
The plant would be operated at high inlet pressure (i.e., 1000 psi) to&#13;
eliminate the need for compression for sales gas pipeline. The plant design&#13;
would take into account the experience so far gained on similar facilities at&#13;
I/  The 3 1/2 inch size tubing used in the four wetis completed uider the SCDP causes excessive pressure&#13;
drop in the tubing.&#13;

pipeline needs to be connected to the 176-km long, 24-inch diameter, 320 MMCFD&#13;
capacity Bakhrabad-Chittagong gas subsystem by means of an Ashuganj-Bakhrabad&#13;
gas pipeline. Taking into account the anticipated market growth rate, the A-B&#13;
pipeline would be a single high pressure, 58-km long, 30-inch diameter&#13;
interconnecting line with a 200 MMCFD initial flow rate capacity. The large&#13;
diameter would avoid or minimize gas transmission pressure drop and, more&#13;
importantly, allow to considerably increase (up to 1000 MMCFD) the line's&#13;
capacity through compression, which is expected to be required at a much later&#13;
date. The pipeline route has been surveyed and selected taking into account&#13;
the need for minimizing environmental degradation of the terrain and land&#13;
acquisition requirements, and possible future offtake points. The route runs&#13;
through a poorly drained lowland, which is typical of much of Bangladesh, and&#13;
is generally flooded more than 5 months per year. The route also crosses the&#13;
Meghna river basin area where floodings and frequent changes in river course&#13;
patterns have been observed over the recent years. To account for this, the&#13;
pipeline would be coated with concrete for its entire length to avoid the risk&#13;
of floating during the monsoon season. The pipeline construction would&#13;
involve 3 major river crossings and burial of the line at about one meter&#13;
below surface.&#13;
8.        The pipeline construction design would consist of: (a) 58 km-long,&#13;
30 inch-diameter pipeline from the Ashuganj multipurpose natural gas site to&#13;
Bakhrabad, with 1135 psi and 1090 psi design and working pressures&#13;
respectively, and 200 MMCFD flow capacity; (b) pigging facilities at both ends&#13;
with provision for pigging while the line is in operation; (c) 2 mainline&#13;
valves, one at about 10 km and the other about 36 km from Ashuganj; (d) 3&#13;
offtakes -- one located at Titas field to serve the Brahmanbaria area as well&#13;
as an inlet. for Titas gas, one about half way for future customers, and one&#13;
near Bakhrabad for the future Meghnaghat power plant; and (e) a complete&#13;
cathodic protection. A provision would also be made for future connection to&#13;
the Eakhrabad-Demra pipeline for serving the greater Dhaka area. The pipeline&#13;
sizing was determined on the basis of a minimum pressure discharge of 450 psi&#13;
to meet the local distribution system pressure requirement. The design&#13;
parameters are consistent with existing North-South and Bakhrabad-Chittagong&#13;
pipelines and with most recent international standards. Corrosion coating&#13;
would be either fusion bonded epoxy, which is preferable, or coal tar enamel.&#13;
Concrete coating would be used in addition to corrosion coating.&#13;
SCADA and Telecommunication System&#13;
9.        The SGDP had a provision for installing a complete supervisory&#13;
control and data acquisition (SCADA) system along with a load dispatch center&#13;
and a telecommunication system on the North-South pipeline. Due to delays in&#13;
the pipeline construction and subsequent SGDP Credit closing, the SCADA could&#13;
not be procured. Except for the recently completed ADB-financed Brahmaputra&#13;
basin distribution pipeline, which has a SCADA system (without dispatch&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

center), Bangladesh's gas transmission and distribution networks are not&#13;
equipped with SCADA. These networks have been operated independently with&#13;
microwave radio links supplemented by telephone facilities. After completion&#13;
of the A-B gas pipeline, efficient operation of the Kailashtilla-Chittagong&#13;
gas trunkline would necessitate a complete SCADA system with dispatch center&#13;
and telecommunication link. The SCADA would allow accurate remote monitoring&#13;
and control of necessary transmission parameters such as gas flows at supply&#13;
and offtake points, current line pressures throughout the network, movement of&#13;
gas and volumes, and quality of gas being supplied to the system by the&#13;
producing companies. Furthermore, the SCADA would provide pipeline integrity&#13;
monitoring, leak detection and alarm, metering values of gas and condensate at&#13;
each of the inlet and outlet points, open-closed status of all line and&#13;
station valves, direct digital data transmission and voice communication. To&#13;
allow data transmission, the microwave analog radio system of the Bakhrabad-&#13;
Chittagong pipeline would be upgraded (digitized) to match the new system.&#13;
10.       Final configuration of the SCADA system would be based on an&#13;
engineering design, which would be undertaken at a later date. The system&#13;
concept, however, includes: (a) a master dispatch center for centralized&#13;
control and monitoring, to be located where it will make the most use of it&#13;
(i.e., GTCL headquarters), equipped with (i) two identical computer based&#13;
master units, one on-line and the other as a back up, (ii) a large graphic&#13;
panel showing schematically the entire transmission network, and (iii) color&#13;
video display consoles; (b) remote terminal units to be installed at each&#13;
terminal station; and (c) various control and command systems, alarm and event&#13;
monitoring devices, printers, loggers and various operating software. The&#13;
SCADA would be supported by a microwave backbone telecommunication system&#13;
supplemented by a VHF mobile radio network and cabled phone links. The&#13;
telecommunication system would include a digital multiplex radio, with data&#13;
interface, supervisory system, power supply, antenna supporting towers and&#13;
other subsystems.&#13;

Terms of Reference for&#13;
Institution BuildinQ Technical Assistance&#13;
A. GTCL TwinninQ&#13;
Background&#13;
1.        Gas transmission and distribution in Bangladesh has been carried&#13;
out through three separate regional subsystems operated independently by three&#13;
subsidiary companies of Petrobangla. With the recent completion of the&#13;
Kailashtilla-Ashuganj (North-South) pipeline, the commissioning of the&#13;
Brahmaputra Basin pipeline in 1992, and the construction of the Ashuganj-&#13;
Bakhrabad (A-B) gas pipeline, Bangladesh will have a major gas trunkline&#13;
interconnecting the three subsystems and stretching from Kailashtilla to&#13;
Chittagong. To achieve effective dispatch of gas supply, thereby enabling&#13;
better gas fields management and increased supply reliability, the Government&#13;
has recently created a national gas transmission company -- the Gas&#13;
Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) -- to operate the above trunkline. To&#13;
develop its capabilities, GTCL intends to enter into a long term twinning&#13;
(collaborative) arrangement with an experienced gas transmission company,&#13;
hereinafter called the twinning "Partner".&#13;
Twinning Obiectives&#13;
2.        The proposed twinning arrangement will be characterized by a closer&#13;
involvement between the two parties than is generally obtained in a standard&#13;
client-consultant relationship. It is aimed at the direct transfer of&#13;
managerial and technical skills and systems that involve of the numerous&#13;
functional aspects of GTCL.&#13;
3.        The key objectives of the twinning would be:&#13;
(a) to provide sustained technical and managerial support aimed at&#13;
building up GTCL's capability to the point where it can&#13;
independently operate all aspects of a gas transmission network;&#13;
(b) to assist in the development and implementation of organizational&#13;
structure, systems, procedures and practices required by a&#13;
commercial gas utility; and&#13;
(c) to provide back-up support in carrying out day-to-day operations.&#13;
Scone of Services&#13;
4.        On assignment the partner would promptly plan and render all&#13;
necessary advice and assistance to GTCL to achieve the objectives set forth in&#13;
para. 3 above within the timeframe to be specified in the contract. Such&#13;
assistance would include, but would not be limited to, the following:&#13;
(a) preparation of a quick diagnostic, jointly with GTCL, to identify&#13;
priority areas on which significant and rapid improvements can be&#13;
made to allow efficient start-up for GTCL;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
ANNEX 4.2&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
(b)  undertaking a complete physical inventory with conditions and&#13;
performance evaluation of the assets transferred from the regional&#13;
companies;&#13;
(c)  development and implementation of organizational structure, systems&#13;
and procedures referred to in para. 3 (b) which would cover:&#13;
(i) network planning and engineering&#13;
(ii) operations and maintenance, including safety audit&#13;
(iii) inventory management&#13;
(iv) accounting and financial management&#13;
(v)  management information system, including SCADA link to generate&#13;
daily, weekly, and monthly operational reports; and&#13;
(vi) personnel management and human resource development&#13;
Such assistance would be provided through secondment of experienced&#13;
professional personnel from the partner's own organization (not recruited&#13;
for the purpose of the twinning contract) into parallel positions in&#13;
GTCL. It is expected that at least five such personnel led by a team&#13;
leader would be posted at GTCL, who will serve in operational capacities&#13;
and will, together with GTCL's top management, have joint responsibility&#13;
for overseeing day-to-day operations and implementation of systems,&#13;
procedures and practices.;&#13;
(d)  provision of back-up services from the headquarters for&#13;
strengthening the corporate structure and systems referred to in&#13;
(a) above;&#13;
(e)  provision of technical specialist personnel and services to&#13;
undertake discrete tasks, as required; and&#13;
(f)  design and implementation of a comprehensive training program which&#13;
would include on-the-job training, selective assignment of GTCL's&#13;
personnel to the partner's organization for first-hand exposure to&#13;
efficient operations, and formal course training.&#13;
Selection Criteria of the Partner&#13;
5.        GTCL would visit several prominent gas transmission companies that&#13;
are regarded as potential candidates for a twinning arrangement and would&#13;
select a partner. The selection criteria would be as follows:&#13;
(a) the partner should have proven record in successfully managing an&#13;
organization having similar scope of functions;&#13;
(b) the partner should have fairly extensive international experiences&#13;
and is willing to transfer its operational knowledge;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
ANNEX 4.2&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
(c) the partner should identify fully with GTCL's operational and&#13;
capacity building needs; and&#13;
(d) the personnel to be seconded to GTCL should have direct operational&#13;
experience and be capable of tackling problems.&#13;
Duration of TwinninQ Arrangement&#13;
6.        The twinning arrangement would be initially for three years.&#13;
Depending on GTCL's needs, and satisfaction with the services, the contract&#13;
can be extended for another period to be determined by both parties.&#13;
B. Environmental and Safety Management Technical Assistance&#13;
Backcrround&#13;
7.        To meet the country's gas demand estimated to grow at about 10 per&#13;
year, Bangladesh is to double the current supply and delivery capacity of&#13;
about 660 MMCFD by the year 2000. In the past, the sector's development has&#13;
had a relatively low impact on the environment and the sector operating&#13;
companies have maintained good safety records. Further expansion, however, in&#13;
one of the most populated land areas (about 1300 people/km2) in the world,&#13;
requires careful integration of environmental and safety considerations. The&#13;
overall policy framework, legislation and institutional capabilities for&#13;
dealing with emerging environmental and natural resource management issues&#13;
have not yet been sufficiently developed. An environmental protection law and&#13;
a national environmental management plan covering a broad range of&#13;
environmental aspects of the national economy have been drafted over the last&#13;
five years by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and are now in the&#13;
process of being approved by the Government. Specific gas sector&#13;
environmental regulations have not yet been developed. With regard to safety,&#13;
the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued in 1986 the Gas Safety&#13;
Rules, which cover transmission, distribution and storage of natural gas, but&#13;
not the upstream activities.&#13;
8.        Notwithstanding its good operational safety records and its&#13;
commitment to adhering to the laws issued by the Government for the protection&#13;
of the national environment and the health and safety of its employees,&#13;
consumers and the general public, as manifested in the December 15, 1992&#13;
Environmental and Safety Policy statement, Petrobangla currently has no well-&#13;
defined safety engineering standards and environmental regulation, nor does it&#13;
have an adequate institutional framework and capability to properly administer&#13;
the safety and environmental aspects of its operations. Recognizing the&#13;
critical need to address this deficiency, Petrobangla has recently created an&#13;
Environment and Safety Division in the Holding Company which would serve as&#13;
the focal point for coordinating among all operating companies (i) development&#13;
and dissemination of a comprehensive set of safety standards and environmental&#13;
protection rules and (ii) implementation of an environmental and safety&#13;
management system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59 -                            ANNEX 4.2&#13;

Obiectives&#13;
9.        The objectives of the envisaged technical assistance are to:&#13;
(a) assist in the development of comprehensive sets of safety standards&#13;
and environmental protection regulations covering exploration,&#13;
production, processing, transmission, distribution, marketing and&#13;
end-use;&#13;
(b) assist in the development and implementation of an adequate&#13;
environmental and safety management system for each operating&#13;
company which shall include procedures for conducting routine&#13;
technical and safety audits and programs for environmental&#13;
mitigation and monitoring;&#13;
(c) assess the human resources requirements for administering the&#13;
environmental and safety aspects and assist in developing&#13;
managerial and professional staff resources through a program of&#13;
in-country and overseas training and new recruitment; and&#13;
(d) assist in putting into place a mechanism/process for ensuring&#13;
adequate public consultation and for stimulating public awareness&#13;
and support for enhancing environment protection and safety.&#13;
Scone of Work&#13;
10.       To achieve the technical assistance objectives, the tasks of the&#13;
consultant would include, but not be limited to:&#13;
(a)  review:  i) existing government environmental and safety policies&#13;
and regulations; and (ii) Petrobangla's current environmental and&#13;
safety procedures and practices, and associated emergency response&#13;
plans;&#13;
(b) assess the environmental impact and safety hazards of existing&#13;
field production facilities and gas transmission and distribution&#13;
systems, including the performance and safety of gas flaring&#13;
equipment configuration at all gas treatment plants;&#13;
(c) review the gas sector land use patterns in terms of environmental&#13;
and social costs, including human resettlements, if any, and forest&#13;
degradation;&#13;
(d) develop a framework for integration of environmental considerations&#13;
in the gas sector's development planning with a view to ensuring&#13;
environmentally sound and sustainable sector development;&#13;
(e) develop guidelines and operating procedures for:&#13;

monitoring;&#13;
(i)  develop staffing requirements and detailed time-bound training&#13;
programs and oversee the implementation of the agreed training&#13;
programs;&#13;
(j)  provide assistance to the Government in upgrading the office of the&#13;
Chief Inspector to enable it to carry out the following functions:&#13;
(i) prepare standards and enforce compliance;&#13;
(ii) investigate gas-sector related occupational accidents;&#13;
(iii) issue safety-related permits; and&#13;
(iv) clear new projects with regard to safety aspects.&#13;
Qualification of the Consultant&#13;
11.       The consultant should be an environmental and safety audit firm,&#13;
specialized in oil and gas upstream and downstream activities. Consultant&#13;
staff to be assigned to Petrobangla should have a minimum experience of five&#13;
years.&#13;
Duration of Technical Assistance&#13;
12.       The consulting contract would be for three years.  Depending on&#13;
Petrobangla's needs, and satisfaction with the services, the contract can be&#13;
extended for another period to be determined by both parties.&#13;
C.  Manacement Systems Improvement Proqram&#13;
Backairound&#13;
13.       Natural gas is Bangladesh's most important source of commercial&#13;
energy.  To meet the country's gas demand estimated to grow at about 10  per&#13;
year, Bangladesh is to double the current supply and delivery capacity of&#13;
about 660 MMCFD by the year 2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 4.2&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
14.       There are presently 17 known gas fields with a total (proven and&#13;
probable) reserves of 21 TCF. Five fields -- Kailashtilla, Rashidpur,&#13;
Habiganj, Titas and Bakhrabad -- account for two thirds of the known gas&#13;
reserves.&#13;
15.       The gas sector in Bangladesh is dominated by the Petrobangla group&#13;
consisting of eight state-owned companies responsible for the exploration,&#13;
production and delivery of natural gas, as well as the exploration for and&#13;
development of oil and solid minerals, including coal. Until mid-1993, the&#13;
Petrobangla Group consisted of the holding corporation (Petrobangla), one&#13;
exploration and drilling company, two production companies, three transmission&#13;
and distribution companies and a natural gas liquids company. In May 1993,&#13;
the Cabinet approved the establishment of the Gas Transmission Company Limited&#13;
(GTCL) to operate the recently completed Kailashtilla-Ashuganj (North-South)&#13;
pipeline and the new Ashuganj-Bakhrabad pipeline. The six operating companies&#13;
responsible for the production and delivery of natural gas are:&#13;
Production&#13;
-    Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited (BGFCL), presently operating&#13;
the fields at Habiganj, Titas, Bakhrabad and Feni; and&#13;
-    Sylhet Gas Fields Limited (SGFL) responsible for producing the&#13;
northern fields at Kailashtilla, Rashidpur and Sylhet.&#13;
Transmission&#13;
-    Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL).&#13;
Transmission &amp; Distribution&#13;
-    Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company (TGTDC), operating&#13;
the transmission and distribution network in the Titas franchise&#13;
area covering the Greater Dhaka area and the Brahmaputra Basin&#13;
northwest of Dhaka, having maximum daily peak demand of around 560&#13;
MMCFD;&#13;
-    Bakhrabad Gas Systems Limited (BGSL), delivering gas to the&#13;
southeastern part of the country including Chittagong area, having&#13;
maximum daily peak demand of around 110 MMCFD; and&#13;
-    Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution Company (JGTDSL),&#13;
dealing with gas transmission and distribution in the Sylhet area,&#13;
having maximum daily peak demand of about 40 MMCFD.&#13;
16.       The FY93 accounts of the five operating companies -- BGFCL, SGFL,&#13;
TGTDC, BGSL and JGTDSL -- are given in Annex 1. Annex 2 contains profiles of&#13;
each company with regard to the accounting systems in use and related matters.&#13;
(This information needs to be reproduced from Eric Gills report] These&#13;
companies operate mainly manual accounting systems based on conventional&#13;
double entry principles. The drawbacks of manual systems together with&#13;
understaffing result in, to various degree, backlog of work, and inaccuracies&#13;
and delays in financial reporting. Further, the lack of standardization of&#13;
data input across the group also causes inordinate delays in preparation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
ANNEX 4.2&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
consolidated group accounts. In the past, the operations of the gas sector&#13;
operating companies suffered from the absence of clearly defined financial&#13;
objectives. Consequently, the top management paid inadequate attention to&#13;
financial management, resulting in understaffing and shortage of qualified and&#13;
trained staff in the accounting and finance function. Presently, there are&#13;
deficiencies in the systems in use for monitoring/controlling all aspects of&#13;
financial operations; and financial data have not been used effectively by&#13;
management as a tool for operational control and corporate planning. In the&#13;
context of ongoing gas sector reforms aimed at mobilizing private capital for&#13;
accelerated gas sector development and improving the operational efficiencies&#13;
of sector entities, Petrobangla group management has recognized the urgent and&#13;
critical need to improve accounting and financial management and has therefore&#13;
decided to engage consultants to assist in the implementation of a group-wide&#13;
financial management improvement program (hereinafter referred to as the&#13;
Program).&#13;
Obiectives&#13;
17.       The objectives of the Program are to (a) improve Petrobangla&#13;
group's accounting and financial reporting in terms of accuracy, adequacy and&#13;
timeliness; (b) build up the capability of the group to discharge effectively&#13;
and efficiently the functions of modern gas utilities in areas of financial&#13;
management and planning.&#13;

accounting, bookkeeping, data processing and clerical staff; and&#13;
(j) based on the above assessments, the consultant should recommend&#13;
programs for upgrading the group's financial management and&#13;
accounting systems and financial management information systems in&#13;
light of international industry standards and practices. The&#13;
recommendations should be specific, practical and cost-effective&#13;
and should include implementation phasing of various recommended&#13;
activities, with the objective of enabling the group companies'&#13;
reaching acceptable industry standards within a time frame of two&#13;
years. At the end of Phase I, the consultant should present its&#13;
findings and recommended upgrading programs to the Petrobangla&#13;
group management and ODA for review.&#13;

TRAINING PROGRAM&#13;
I. Background&#13;
1.        Mainly due to the cumbersome internal approval procedures pertaining&#13;
to the selection of candidates for training, staff training has not received&#13;
adequate attention during the past decade. Despite provisions made by each of&#13;
the co-financiers under the Second Gas Development Project (SGDP), training&#13;
undertaken was limited to a few in-country drilling courses conducted by the&#13;
drilling contractor and attended by some 40 staff.   Altogether, only 9% of&#13;
Petrobangla Holding Company staff received training; the ratio for the operating&#13;
companies is less than 1. Recognizing the urgent need to develop and upgrade&#13;
the skills of its staff to implement capacity additions and operate a gas supply&#13;
and delivery system of growing size and complexity, Petrobangla management has&#13;
decided to initiate a training program to develop in-house capabilities in all&#13;
aspects of gas sector operations.&#13;
II. Manor Areas of Training&#13;
2.        Overseas TraininQ.   The proposed training program would cover key&#13;
operational areas including geophysics, geology, well drilling, well production,&#13;
gas transmission and distribution, SCADA, safety and environmental protection,&#13;
and accounting and financial management.&#13;
Geovhysics&#13;
3.        Past  experience  indicates  that  geophysical  surveys  are  a  very&#13;
effective tool in appraising and developing Bangladesh's gas fields. With most&#13;
of the fields not yet fully developed, geophysics is expected to play an&#13;
important role in the sector's future development.  Given the limited seismic&#13;
activity carried out in Bangladesh over the recent years and the tremendous&#13;
technological advance worldwide in geophysics, Petrobangla would train selected&#13;
geophysists in seismic surveys, including data acquisition, processing and&#13;
interpretation,. with a special focus on both outstep and inf ill drilling, and the&#13;
use of 3-D seismic in reserve evaluation and determination of reservoir&#13;
boundaries. *The proposed training would also involve topics such as: (a) how to&#13;
minimize the risk of offset well locations, which would be particularly useful&#13;
given the limited drilling resources available in Bangladesh; (b) resolving&#13;
structural complexities of some of the fields where only one or two wells have&#13;
so far been drilled; and (c) database creation and integration of  existing&#13;
seismic data with other geological and drilling data for conversion to computer&#13;
format, which would facilitate future field work and enhance the exploration&#13;
promotion data packages. About 5 geophysists would benefit from this training&#13;
for about 4 weeks each.&#13;
Geoloa"y and Gas Reservoir&#13;
4.        The geology of Bangladesh's gas fields can be complex, particularly&#13;
for those with several gas bearing reservoirs. The lithology of several major&#13;
fields exhibits a great deal of variation with complex changes that affect&#13;
reservoir characteristics. Field structural interpretations are often incomplete&#13;
due to insufficient seismic coverage. To address the geological unknowns and&#13;
optimize the development of its gas resources, Petrobangla has formulated a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
ANNEX 4.3&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
training program for its geologists and reservoir engineers. The training would&#13;
involve interpretation of depositional environment of large deltaic sequences&#13;
which characterize much of Bangladesh' s geology, definition of hydrocarbon source&#13;
rock, timing of hydrocarbon migration and accumulation, structural traps, and&#13;
prospect definition. The training would also include reservoir analysis such as&#13;
rock and fluid properties, reservoir mechanisms, reservoir modeling, ultimate gas&#13;
recovery and abandonment pressure, water drive and volumetric depletion&#13;
mechanisms, and well completion techniques. The proposed training would also&#13;
allow  Petrobangla  to  establish  computer-generated  isopach,   structure,&#13;
paleostructure, porosity and pore volume maps using available seismic and&#13;
drilling data. About 6 geologists and reservoir engineers would benefit from&#13;
this training for about 4 weeks each.&#13;
Well Drillinq&#13;
5.        Petrobangla owns a drilling rig fleet which is old, worn out and most&#13;
of the time inactive. of this fleet, only two medium and two small size rigs&#13;
have a salvageable value of less than one million US$. Presently, Petrobangla&#13;
has neither the necessary equipment nor the resources to drill gas wells&#13;
efficiently. Training on well drilling would allow its staff to access latest&#13;
technologies. These include multiwell pad (cluster) drilling and horizontal well&#13;
techniques, both of which would considerably enhance the overall drilling&#13;
performance in terms of total well cost, productivity and, of equall importance,&#13;
land use for well locations. The training would also focus on non-toxic drilling&#13;
fluid chemicals, one of the concerns of Petrobangla's drilling activity. Such&#13;
training would help its staff to restructure its well drilling activity and&#13;
respond to any level of interest by the private sector in forming a joinc&#13;
venture. In addition, the training would enable Petrobangla to compare between&#13;
refurbishing its rig fleet or contracting the drilling activity to specialized&#13;
contractors, which proved to be the least cost approach under the SGDP. About&#13;
20 staff would benefit from this training for about 4 weeks each.&#13;
Well Completion&#13;
6.        Poor well completion has seriously affected the productivity and&#13;
performance of Petrobangla's gas wells, particularly those drilled under the&#13;
SGDP.   Although the main cause was- the poor performance of the technical&#13;
assistance associated with the drilling activity at that time, the lack of&#13;
awareness on the part of Petrobangla. technical staff could perpetuate the&#13;
problem.   For this reason,  selected staff would receive training in well&#13;
productivity analyses and completion design, prediction of bottomhole and surface&#13;
pressures, productivity optimization techniques and wellhead configuration.&#13;
Appropriate well completion design would allow Petrobangla to implement adequate&#13;
overall reservoir management and optimize its gas production. About 10 staff&#13;
would benefit from this training for about 4 weeks each.&#13;
Gas Treatment Processes&#13;
7.        With more and more natural gas liquids extraction facilities to be put&#13;
on stream during the next few years, Petrobangla requires extensive training in&#13;
gas treatment technologies. The proposed training would involve basic equipment&#13;
and design concepts used in gas processing plants, various process technologies,&#13;
basic plant instrumentation and operating procedures. Specific courses would&#13;
include gas and liquids analyses; dew point calculations; flash calculations;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
ANNEX 4.3&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
design concept of distillation columns, heat exchangers, dehydrators, and&#13;
refrigeration systems; gas and-liquids measurements; and, corrosion control.&#13;
Training would also be offered in construction contract management; quality&#13;
control procedures, both at manufacturers and during actual construction; and,&#13;
plant testing and commissioning.   The proposed training program would enable&#13;
Petrobangla to operate its gas processing plants with minimum technical&#13;
assistance. About 14 staff would benefit from this training for about 5 weeks&#13;
each.&#13;
Gas Transmission&#13;
8.        To properly operate and manage the expanded gas network system, the&#13;
newly formed gas transmission company, GTCL, would require extensive training in&#13;
all aspects of gas transmission. Much of this training is expected to be carried&#13;
out under GTCL's twinning arrangement through a combination of classroom courses&#13;
and hands-on workshops. High priority would be placed on transmission operations&#13;
management, demand management, system integrity assessment, preventive&#13;
maintenance, measurement engineering, grid control and dispatch, and long term&#13;
planning.   The training would also include computer simulation of gas flow&#13;
hydraulics, gas energy management modelling, welding technology, metallurgical&#13;
testing, pipeline integrity, on-line inspection, and maintenance and repair. In&#13;
addition to the training to be provided under the twinning arrangement, about 20&#13;
staff would benefit from a specially designed training program for about 4 weeks&#13;
per staff.&#13;
9.        To ensure satisfactory operation and maintenance of the SCADA and&#13;
telecommunication system, specific training courses would be conducted in Dhaka&#13;
by the contractor and the installation supervision consultant.   A detailed&#13;
training program would be finalized in conjunction with the supply and&#13;
consultancy contracts. The training would cover the following:&#13;
(a) for system operators -- keyboard skills, Scada functions, electronic&#13;
mail, and telecommunication;&#13;
(b) for field technicians -- routine test procedures, preventive&#13;
maintenance and emergency repair procedures; and&#13;
(c)  for engineers -- management and overall development and utilization&#13;
of the system.&#13;
Some of the training would take place during the manufacturing of the system at&#13;
the vendor's premises to familiarize and train the personnel in the use of the&#13;
hardware and software.  Prior to the SCADA training, the selected candidates&#13;
would be trained in computer language. Overseas study tours to visit similar&#13;
installations would also be organized.  Furthermore, about 10 staff would benefit&#13;
from a specially designed training program for about 4 weeks per staff.&#13;
Safety&#13;
10.       As Bangladesh's gas system expands, potential hazards are expected to&#13;
increase. Safety, therefore, will be given high priority by all operating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                          ANNEX 4.3&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
companies and Petrobangla management.  To minimize the risks, as part of the&#13;
overall environmental and safety management, each company will conduct hazard&#13;
assessment and develop safety codes and emergency procedures.  The training,&#13;
which would be provided by specialized firms in and outside Bangladesh, would&#13;
allow Petrobangla's personnel to fully understand the environment in which gas&#13;
operations are undertaken, and would address safety topics associated with gas&#13;
production, processing and transmission. Safety awareness will be initiated at&#13;
all levels of field operations through workshops and seminars. The objectives&#13;
would be to have all gas facilities, from the wellheads to processing plants and&#13;
transmission and distribution systems, operated in a framework where safety is&#13;
part of each step. Safety would also be promoted through standardization of&#13;
surface facilities. In this regard, when a transmission company like GTCL is&#13;
created, personnel should be able to travel from one location to another and be&#13;
familiar with the design and layout of the facilities. Standard designs should&#13;
be used for most of the installations, e.g. metering stations, valve stations and&#13;
scraper stations. Standardization would facilitate emergency response. About&#13;
20 staff would benefit from this training for about 4 weeks each.&#13;
Environment&#13;
11.       The proposed training program in environmental protection would cover&#13;
all facets of gas development. It would include:&#13;
(a) emission control, which should begin at the stage of equipment and&#13;
facility design and continue during the operational phase;&#13;
(b) groundwater protection against contamination during well drilling&#13;
operations;&#13;
(c) drilling and other process plant waste (spent molecular sieve&#13;
material) treatment and disposal;&#13;
(d)  gas well blowout prevention while drilling and during production;&#13;
(e) methane leak control throughout the gas transmission and distribution&#13;
network;&#13;
(f) contingency plan and emergency response specifically designed to&#13;
contain and control any surface facility-related accident;&#13;
(g) treatment and discharge of formation water; and&#13;
(h) procedures for identifying, managing and minimizing hazardous waste&#13;
on site.&#13;
About 20 staff would benefit from this training for about 4 weeks each.&#13;
12.       In-country Training.   In-country training would also be developed&#13;
under the project where more than 200 staff are expected to benefit from this&#13;
training, which will cover all aspects of gas sector development.   However,&#13;
Petrobangla has no adequate training facilities, except for the Titas Gas&#13;
Transmission and Distribution Company's (TGTDC) center at Demra. This center&#13;
could be used for part of the training programs intended for field operations.&#13;
The center would need expansion which may require a lengthy construction work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70 -&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
While the center's expansion is worth considering, the use of the Bangladesh&#13;
Petroleum Institute (BPI) at Dhaka is another possibility. BPI was set up in&#13;
1981 with the assistance of UNDP and NORAD of Norway to provide advanced&#13;
technological support for the gas sector in Bangladesh. BPI reportedly performed&#13;
well during its early years and then its activity declined due to the lack of&#13;
resources.   Petrobangla would reach an agreement with BPI to ensure its&#13;
availability for most of the in-country training activity. The TGTDC's center&#13;
can still be sued for training field technicians.&#13;

Summary of Environmental and Safety Assessment&#13;
I. BackQround&#13;
1.        Petrobangla, a group of eight state-owned companies, is responsible&#13;
for the exploration, production and delivery of natural gas. To balance&#13;
supply with demand for gas, Petrobangla is to undertake further investments to&#13;
expand the country's gas supply capacity and delivery infrastructure. The&#13;
proposed project is a part of the gas sector's priority investment program for&#13;
FY95-2000. As per GOB's environment policy, Petrobangla, assisted by&#13;
international consultant, carried out an Environmental and Safety Assessment&#13;
(ESA) for the proposed project under terms of reference prepared jointly by&#13;
Petrobangla and IDA.&#13;
II. The Prolect&#13;
2.        The proposed project consists of the following physical components:&#13;
(a) drilling of three production wells at Rashidpur gas field;&#13;
(b) construction of a gas dehydration plant to purify gas from the new&#13;
wells;&#13;
(c)  a 5S-km, 30-inch diameter gas pipeline from Ashuganj to Bakhrabad;&#13;
and&#13;
(d) a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and pipeline&#13;
telecommunication system for the entire transmission trunkline from&#13;
Kailashtilla to Chittagong.&#13;
The target date for the completion of the drilling and pipeline components is&#13;
December 1996, while that of the SCADA system and gas dehydration plant are&#13;
June 1997 and December 1997 respectively.&#13;
III. Baseline Conditions&#13;
3.        The project area including the well sites and the pipeline right-&#13;
of-way totals about 17.5 km2, of which about 60% is under cultivation&#13;
throughout the year.&#13;
Ponulation and Land Use&#13;
4.        Population densities in the project area vary from a high of 1313&#13;
persons/km2 along the A-B pipeline route to a low of 591 persons/km2 in the&#13;
Rashidpur gas field. Land use is predominantly cereal and vegetable crop&#13;
agriculture with limited agro-forestry and tea plantations.&#13;
5.        Flat floodplains predominate in the project area.  The A-B pipeline&#13;
route traverses the Middle Meghna River Flood Plain, the Old Meghna Estuarine&#13;
Floodplain, the Titas Floodplain and the Old Brahmaputra Floodplain in a&#13;
mainly north-south direction in the districts of Brahmanbaria and Comilla.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 8&#13;
The route area is open flat low-lying agricultural land; the main crops are&#13;
rice and jute. The Rashidpur area is predominantly tea plantations and agro-&#13;
forestry.&#13;
Climate&#13;
6.        The project area has a tropical climate with a wet monsoon period&#13;
from April/May to September/October with frequent heavy storms and rain&#13;
showers. Annual rainfall varies between 1500 to 2500 mm in the Ashuganj areas&#13;
to 3500 to 5000 mm in the Rashidpur area. Maximum daily temperatures vary&#13;
between 250C during winter and 350C during April and September. Lows of SIC&#13;
are recorded in December and January. Highs of 390C are recorded in May and&#13;
June.&#13;
Hvdroloqv and Water Oualitv&#13;
7.        In the project area, there is a fairly extensive aquifer at a&#13;
shallow depth of 6-12 m below ground level; at a depth of 60-120 m , there is&#13;
a deeper aquifer. Both aquifers are accessed and utilized extensively by&#13;
handwells and deep tube wells for potable water and irrigation. The density&#13;
of tubewells ranges from 5 to 11 per km2. Groundwater samples taken at&#13;
Brahmanbaria show elevated iron levels indicating impaired groundwater&#13;
quality.&#13;
Air Qualitx&#13;
8.        Air quality in the project area is generally good.  Fuelwood,&#13;
kerosene and animal dung are used as fuels. Local air quality could be&#13;
impaired in the event of a well blowout. This concern will be addressed&#13;
through the development of a well site contingency plan.&#13;
soils&#13;
9.        Baseline studies have been carried out to establish the profile and&#13;
soil properties for major soil types along the A-B Pipeline route. Eleven&#13;
different soil associations and four physiographic sub-regions are contained&#13;
within a 500 m boundary along either side of the A-B Pipeline. Almost all of&#13;
the soil associations are chromieutric gleysols, with some chromi-umbric-&#13;
gleysols and molli-eutric-gleysol or fluvisol, and possibly some chromi-fluvic&#13;
gleysols. The Rashidpur gas field is comprised of 6 soil associations&#13;
contained within three physiographic sub-regions. All soils require&#13;
fertilizers to allow high yield varieties and/or multiple cropping patterns.&#13;
Fisher&#13;
10.       Small fish ponds along the pipeline route represent an important&#13;
source of protein for rural population. A combination of over-fishing,&#13;
pollution, deforestation and hydraulic structures have led to a continual&#13;
decline in fishery resources. Any proposed development which will alter&#13;
sediment load, flow regime or composition of the stream will require careful&#13;
planning to avoid consequential impacts.&#13;

Resettlement, Land Acauisition and Compensation&#13;
11.       Given the high density of settlements, any incremental loss of land&#13;
which affects food production, available living space, forest resources and&#13;
wildlife habitat is significant to Bangladesh. Traditionally, land&#13;
acquisition has been associated with delayed compensation payments. The lack&#13;
of a public participation process has contributed to resentment of earlier&#13;
pipeline projects. The pipeline route has been selected taking into account&#13;
the need to minimize involuntary resettlement. Location of well sites would&#13;
be chosen to minimize well site land requirements and land degradation. A&#13;
public consultation and information program is being implemented as part of A-&#13;
B Pipeline land acquisition.&#13;
12.       In order for environmental and social impacts to be fully&#13;
understood, properly planned for and mitigated, a baseline data acquisition&#13;
program was carried out during July 1993-July 1994. Table A provides a&#13;
summary of the data acquired for the project.&#13;
IV. Potential Sicinificant Environmental Imnacts and Mitigation Measures&#13;
13.       Potential significant environmental and social impacts of the&#13;
project pertain to the following:&#13;
(a) surface water and groundwater contamination due to improper&#13;
handling of solid and liquid wastes;&#13;
(b) soil degradation and loss of fertility due to compaction and&#13;
erosion that could arise during the pipeline construction; and&#13;
(c) dissatisfaction of the people affected by the project.&#13;
The impacts, mitigation measures, work program and monitoring required to&#13;
ensure compliance are summarized in Table B.&#13;
V. Safety Aspects&#13;
14.       The entire project design will be in accordance with applicable&#13;
international safety codes and standards. Construction of the project works&#13;
will be undertaken by experienced international contractors who use high&#13;
standards of safety and environmental protection.&#13;
15.       The safety aspect of gas transmission, distribution and storage is&#13;
regulated by Bangladesh's existing law, namely, the 1991 Natural Gas Safety&#13;
Rules. However, the lack of adequate formal, uniform standards and technical&#13;
procedures within the Petrobangla group tends to inhibit the effectiveness of&#13;
the above legislation. As part of the environment and safety assessment, a&#13;
team of experts from British Gas was engaged in August 1993 to carry out a&#13;
safety audit of the group's entire operations. The audit concludes that all&#13;
operating companies are generally operating an adequate system. Nevertheless,&#13;
several important recommendations have emerged from the audit. These relate&#13;
to the need for the Petrobangla group to:&#13;

Page 4 of 8&#13;
(a) adopt a common set of safety standards and codes that are&#13;
comprehensive, up to date and are disseminated to managers and&#13;
supervisors;&#13;
(b) carry out technical audits of existing facilities and systems to&#13;
ensure their compliance with the requirements of the 1991 Gas&#13;
Safety Rules;&#13;
(c) adopt common emergency response procedures;&#13;
(d) provide formal and certificated training for managers, supervisors&#13;
and operatives particularly with regard to the following:&#13;
(i) regulator design, operation and maintenance;&#13;
(ii) pipeline maintenance;&#13;
(iii) leak detection and pipeline surveillance; and&#13;
(iv) corrosion prevention.&#13;
Theme recommendations will be incorporated in the terms of reference for the&#13;
environmental and safety management technical assistance to be implemented&#13;
under the project.&#13;
IV.  Environmental and Safety Manaciement Tgchnical Assistance&#13;
,6.       To assist the Petrobangla group in implementing the recommendations&#13;
of the ESA and in developing in-house capability to properly administer the&#13;
environmental and safety aspects, the project includes a 3-year technical&#13;
assistance. Draft terms of reference is given in Annex 4.2.&#13;

the corresponding table in IDA's Appraisal Report. The table should show any&#13;
substantial changes in the cost estimates that have become necessary since the&#13;
previous report. The reasons for such changes should be explained in the text&#13;
of the report. Estimates should be reviewed and if necessary revised from&#13;
time to time. Such revisions may be necessary after important contracts have&#13;
been awarded, for instance, or when a substantial change has taken place in&#13;
exchange rates. In any case, the estimates should be reviewed not less&#13;
frequently than once a year.&#13;
11.       As the exhibit indicates, the report should show the amount of&#13;
expenditures up to the end of the reporting period, and the balance of&#13;
expenditures still to be made to complete the project on the basis of the&#13;
latest estimated costs. Cost estimates and expenditures in foreign currency&#13;
should be shown separately from those in local currency, for each of the main&#13;
items comprising the project.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Method&#13;
1.        As described in Chapter VI, the proposed project forms an integral&#13;
part of the gas sector's least cost priority investment program (PIP) for&#13;
FY95-2000 and, therefore, cost-benefit analysis needs to be carried out of the&#13;
entire PIP rather than of the project in isolation. Incremental capital&#13;
costs, operating and maintenance costs, and benefit streams (all in terms of&#13;
1994 prices) are shown in Table 1. Assumptions underlying these figures are&#13;
detailed below.&#13;
CaDital Costs&#13;
2.        Anticipated capital expenditures at financial prices based on the&#13;
sector's investment program for FY95-2000 are converted to economic prices by:&#13;
(i) expressing the import content at CIF prices; and (ii) applying the&#13;
standard conversion factor of 0.90 to local costs.&#13;
OperatinQ and Maintenance Costs&#13;
3.        Because of development lead time, commissioning of physical&#13;
investments would start from FY98 onwards. Incremental operating and&#13;
maintenance costs associated with the PIP are calculated at a level equal to&#13;
3% of cumulative investment costs for FY98-2001 and assumed to be constant&#13;
thereafter to FY2015.&#13;
Economic Benefits&#13;
4.        Only the FY98-2002 cumulative incremental sales of gas and liquids&#13;
have been considered as benefits of the FY95-2000 PIP; for FY2002-2015, the&#13;
benefits are assumed to be constant and at the FY2002 level. Economic&#13;
benefits of incremental gas supply are calculated using (i) average gas&#13;
tariff; and (ii) the cost of substitute fuel, i.e., the CIF Chittagong price&#13;
for high sulphur, heavy fuel oil, as proxies of benefits. Average tariff is&#13;
assumed to reach Tk 54/MCF in FY95 and remain constant in real terms&#13;
thereafter. The price of fuel oil used in the analysis is based on CIF&#13;
Chittagong price of about US$ 90 per metric ton.&#13;
Results of Analysis&#13;
5.        The results of the economic cost/benefit analysis together with&#13;
those of the sensitivity test against (i) a 20% increase in capital costs,&#13;
(ii) lower sales growth of 7% p.a., and (iii) combination of higher capital&#13;
costs and slower sales growth are summarized in Table 2.&#13;
6.        Sensitivity analysis based on the first slice of the PIP, for which&#13;
financing has been secured and of which the proposed project forms a part, has&#13;
also been carried out. The results are summarized in Table 3.&#13;
