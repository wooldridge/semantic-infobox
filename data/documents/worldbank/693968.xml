Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
PERU&#13;
JUDICIAL REFORM PROJECT&#13;
L THE JUDICUIL SECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1. 1   Peru in the past seven years has seen dramatic reforms in economic policy for growth and social&#13;
development, and changes in the definition of the role of the State required to increase government's capacity&#13;
to govern. Since President Fujimori first took office in July 1990, the Government of Peruj has pursued a&#13;
program of economic reform that is remarkable for both its depth and its speed, at the same time that it has&#13;
created an atmosphere of domestic tranquillity. This economic program has included trade liberalization, a&#13;
shift in the ownership of state-owned enterprises, financial sector adjustment, labor market deregulation, and&#13;
incipient rationalization of central public administration.&#13;
1.2   Economic reform and recovery are all the more remarkable given the consequences of a decade of&#13;
decline and macroeconomic mismanagement in the 1980s. These consequences are evident in the decline of&#13;
public spending, relative to GDP; in the inefficiency of public expenditure allocation, and particularly in the&#13;
disinvestments in health and education; in the decay of infrastructure and the poor quality of its maintenance;&#13;
in the proliferation of public sector agencies with overlapping responsibilities and limited financial&#13;
accountability; and in increasing public debt and pension liabilities.&#13;
1.3   The reforms and economic recovery of the past five years have occurred within the context of a&#13;
redefinition of the role of the State, codified in the new Constitution adopted in 1993 which narrows the&#13;
state's mandate away from productive activities and reorients government's role in the delivery of key public&#13;
services. To date, institutional reform and restructuring have taken particular aim at the redefinition of the&#13;
regulatory framework, the alleviation of poverty, and the improvement of conditions for private sector&#13;
participation in economic growth. However, Peru's public institutions remain fragile and the issue of&#13;
institutional sustainability is of paramount importance.&#13;
1.4   In recognition of this fragility, the government has committed itself to a program of public sector&#13;
modernization. With the re-election of President Fujimori, it has become clear that part of the agenda for his&#13;
second term is the institutional consolidation of economic reforms to assure that progress made to date is&#13;
sustained. In this context, and as was stressed by the President himself on various occasions, the need for&#13;
public sector reform and reform of the "rules of the game" for private sector development, including judicial&#13;
reform, are imperatives.&#13;
1.5    A modem State requires an effective rule of law, including modem laws and an adequate justice&#13;
system. These are indispensable conditions to create a favorable investment climate, alleviate poverty, and&#13;
incorporate all social sectors into the productive process. This will not only ensure the efficiency and stability&#13;
of economic transactions but also the promotion of employment, income and standard of living of the poorest&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.6    Substantial updating of laws and regulations governing economic transactions has occurred in Peru in&#13;
recent years. However, as pointed out in the Bank's private sector assessment, serious shortcomings exist in&#13;
the application and interpretation of laws by the courts'. The judicial sector largely fails to apply and interpret&#13;
laws in an equitable, effective and efficient manner. Surveys and reports confirm the reality of a judiciary with&#13;
unpredictable and low quality outcomes, unreasonable times to disposition, low levels of accessibility and&#13;
extensive politicization and corruption.&#13;
1.7    Thus, the Peruvian judiciary is behind the times. Profound reforms are required in the justice system&#13;
in order to facilitate the consolidation of economic reforms, encourage the productivity of enterprises and&#13;
foster the integration of the poorest people into the productive process. Without a solid and respected justice&#13;
system capable of guaranteeing in practice security of person and property, the aspirations of people,&#13;
especially the poor, to participate in the benefits of economic and social opportunity cannot be fulfilled and&#13;
private sector development is discouraged. In fact, in a private sector assessment carried out by IFC in&#13;
February 1993, the judiciary and security concerns were singled out as the two most important political and&#13;
institutional constraints for the development of the private sector in the country.3&#13;
B. Structure of the Judicial Sector&#13;
1.8    Peru follows a traditional tripartite model of government with three autonomous branches of&#13;
government (Executive, Legislative and Judicial). Like most other Latin American countries, however, this&#13;
constitutional equality is not realized in practice and the government is characterized by a strong Executive&#13;
Branch and a weak Judicial Branch. The judicial sector in Peru comprises the following: the Judiciary,&#13;
formed by the Supreme Court and other inferior courts; the Ministry of Justice; the Public Ministry, the&#13;
National Council of the Magistracy; the Academy of the Magistracy; the Office of the Public Defender; and&#13;
the Constitutional Tribunal Follows a brief summary of each institution.&#13;
1.9    The Judiciary comprises the following: the Supreme Court, Superior Courts or Courts of Appeal,&#13;
Specialized Courts or Courts (or Juzgados) of First Instance, and Justices of the Peace (both professional and&#13;
lay judges). The court system is distributed loosely according to the defined political jurisdictions of the&#13;
country. There are 24 departments (political jurisdictions) and 24 judicial districts, roughly correspondent,&#13;
and two additional districts in preparation (Cono Sur and Chosica). The Supreme Court serves the whole&#13;
nation, while there is a Superior Court in each judicial district. Under the Superior Courts there are first&#13;
instance courts and a small number of "professional" Justices of the Peace. Currently there are about 1,500&#13;

and undertook a number of diagnostic studies and prepared reform proporsals.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
professional judges throughout the country. "Lay" justices of peace amount to about 4,300. They serve as a&#13;
real conciliatory justice for small claims. (see Annex 4)&#13;
1.10   The Academy of the Magistracy (Academia de la Magistratura, or AM) is a separate unit within the&#13;
Judiciary charged with the education and training of judges and prosecutors at all levels. Its Charter specifies&#13;
three distinct purposes of training: (i) prepare aspiring judges and prosecutors for judicial duties; (ii) upgrade&#13;
skills and knowledge of existing judges eligible for and seeking promotion; and (iii) provide continuing legal&#13;
education for all judges. (See Annex 5)&#13;
1.11 The National Council of the Magistracy (Consejo Nacional de la Magistratura, or CNM) is a separate&#13;
institution emanated from the 1993 Constitution. Its mandate is to select, appoint, ratify and remove judges&#13;
and prosecutors at all levels. With clear autonomy in the namning of judges, the CNM is a key element in&#13;
assuring the independence of the Judiciary. The CNM directly appoints all judges, without any presidential or&#13;
congressional intervention. Also, the CNM is responsible for ratifying judges every seven years and is&#13;
endowed with the capacity to remove Supreme Court judges. (See Annex 6)&#13;
1.12   The Office of the Public Defender (Defensoria del Pueblo, or DP) is a constitutional level ombudsman&#13;
charged with the defense of the fundamental rights of citizens and the supervision of compliance of the public&#13;
sector with its legally defined responsibilities. An autonomous body, elected for a five-year term by&#13;
Congress, the DP is required to submit an annual report to Congress. The first DP was appointed by&#13;
Congress in April 1996, and initiated its activity in September 1996. (See Annex 7)&#13;
1.13   The Tribunal of Constitutional Guarantees (TCG) adjudicates constitutional issues. It also has&#13;
jurisdiction over legal actions invoking constitutionally-guaranteed actions whereby a citizen may allege the&#13;
violation of a constitutional right by the authorities or by another private citizen. After some delays, all the&#13;
seven positions were appointed by Congress in June 1996, and the TCG started its activity in October 1996.&#13;
1.14   The Ministry of Justice provides the link between the Executive and other branches of Government&#13;
on all matters related to the judicial sector. As such, it is the Executive's arm for interacting with the&#13;
Judiciary. The Public Ministry represents judicial processes ofthe society. Criminal prosecution involves the&#13;
bulk of the cases involving the Public Ministry.&#13;
C. Issues&#13;
1.15  The judicial system in Peru largely shows an inadequate performance when measured against&#13;
basic standards and principles of independence and accountability, access, efficiency and professional&#13;
competence and integrity. This results in a system with very low public trust and confidence. This has&#13;
not always been the case. It is more accurately a declining trend particularly in the last thirty years.&#13;
Follows an overview of the main elements of the judicial system and their performance. The comments&#13;
below focus on the civil and commercial side of the justice sector, but many of them may apply to other&#13;
parts of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Independence and Accountability&#13;
1.16  Judicial Ampointment, Compensation and Evaluation. Peru's basic laws on the Judiciary&#13;
(the Constitution of Peru and the Organic Law of the Judiciary) provide that the Judiciary is an&#13;
autonomous power of the State, independent of the Executive and the Legislature. Further, the&#13;
Constitution itself provides safeguards for judicial independence such as the prohibition of interference&#13;
by other branches of the government in judicial proceedings or from exercising judicial functions,&#13;
prohibition of involuntary transfers, specified tenure and an adequate salary. Despite such structural&#13;
independence, like many other Latin American countries, Peru has not enjoyed a tradition of judicial&#13;
independence as reflected, in the pervasive politicization of the appointment and removal of its judges as&#13;
well as the constant low budgets and salaries assigned to the judicial sector.&#13;
1.17  Many judges today are without tenure. Judicial tenure has been more the exception than the rule&#13;
in Peru where three purges of the Judiciary have occurred within the last thirty years. The last purge&#13;
came with the autogolpe of April 1992, when virtually all judges and prosecutors were dismissed. A&#13;
process to restore judicial tenure commenced in 1993 with the appointment by the Constitutional&#13;
Congress of Democracy. First an interim Jury of Honor, comprised of five well known and respected&#13;
jurists. The Jury of Honor functioned for two years, until the CNM became operational, and in such&#13;
period appointed the Supreme Court members and the appellate and first instance judges and&#13;
prosecutors in the judicial district of Lima.&#13;
1.18  The CNM  has represented an important step towards a fully transparent and merit-based&#13;
appointment system. In October of 1995, it established guidelines of public competition for the&#13;
selection of the superior judges and prosecutors. By March 1996, it had completed the appointments of&#13;
superior judges and prosecutors nationwide. It has now to complete the appointment of vacancies at&#13;
the trial level. There is a general recognition that the CNM has acted with objectivity in the recent&#13;
appointments. Mechanisms have been provided for transparency and participation of the public. At the&#13;
same time, however, there is agreement among members of the CNM, judges and experts that the&#13;
system of selection, including public examinations, needs to be improved to better ensure that the most&#13;
qualified lawyers are appointed to the bench at all levels.&#13;
1.19 Because of efforts by the interim Jury of Honor and the CNM, about half of the vacancies have&#13;
been filled during the past two years. Nevertheless, the CNM faces the task of appointing at least 500&#13;
judges of first instance. It expects to carry out the appointment process in stages in close coordination&#13;
with the AM. Besides this emergency task, the CNM will need to fill the vacancies that occur as natural&#13;
course (about 30 judges and 30 prosecutors per year) and also establish a system of periodic evaluation&#13;
to be linked to the ratification process. To assist the CNM in fulfilling the emergency task, Congress&#13;
recently approved changes to the Organic Law of the CNM, implementing the constitutional mandate&#13;
that candidates be trained by the AM as prerequisite to judicial selection and appointment. This is&#13;
certainly a positive step toward enhancing the functional coordination between the CNM and the AM in&#13;
the area of judicial selection; at the same time, it has become urgently necessary for the AM to develop&#13;
training programs for aspiring judges, based on technical criteria compatible with CNM's selection&#13;
criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.20  Not only tenure is elusive, but judicial salaries are also extremely low in absolute and relative&#13;
terms. They are about one-third to one- half of the equivalent salaries in the private sector. In addition,&#13;
they are not in line with the legal standards. Indeed, the Organic Law of the Judiciary provides that a&#13;
superior judge must earn 80% of the salary of a Supreme Court judge and that a first instance judge&#13;
must earn 70% of the same salary. Currently a Supreme Court judge earns approximately US$4,500&#13;
while a superior court judge earns approximately US$1,800 (including bonus) and a first instance judge&#13;
earns approximately US$1,300 (including bonus) Administrative personnel in the Judiciary also receive&#13;
very low salaries. Competitive salaries are a critical element of ensuring judicial independence.&#13;
Although this issue cannot be discussed separately from the generic problem facing public sector&#13;
salaries, it is true that the present salary level is a disincentive to attract more qualified personnel and to&#13;
ensure judicial independence. It is important to increase judicial salaries as a sign of the government's&#13;
commitment to judicial reform. During 1996, the Judiciary has made its own efforts to improve&#13;
economic incentives of judges. In January 1996 a scheme of productivity bonus was introduced by&#13;
using the Judiciary's own income, as a part of administrative modernization initiatives (para. 1.33).&#13;
Also, to strengthen its financial base, measures have been taken to improve the current fee collection&#13;
system and rationalize administrative and auxiliary court personnel.  As the result, the level of&#13;
productivity bonus was doubled during the recent six months (see Table 2). The Judiciary authorities&#13;
are currently investigating the feasibility and ways to further increase economic incentives for judicial&#13;
personnel.&#13;
1.21  Discitlinarv System. The disciplinary system for judges has been largely ineffective. There are&#13;
a number of sanction levels for judges including warning, fine, suspension, separation and removal from&#13;
office. The CNM has the power to remove judges while the Office for the Supervision of the&#13;
Magistracy (Oficina de Control de la Magistratura, or OCMA) of the Judiciary imposes the other&#13;
sanctions. However, to date, there is no systematic system for monitoring and evaluating judges'&#13;
performance, except that the OCMA has been functioning to receive and analyze public complaints of&#13;
judicial decisions and/or processes. Recently, district-level disciplinary commissions were established to&#13;
strengthen the OCMA's supervision capacity through decentralized management. District disciplinary&#13;
commissions are headed by respective Superior Court Presidents and with the participation of various&#13;
levels ofjudges (as fixed-term assignment for OCMA) in the districts.&#13;
1.22  Budeetary Resources.  The political environment in Peru has traditionally neglected the&#13;
financial support of the Judiciary. The previous 1979 Constitution established that the Judiciary should&#13;
receive a minimum of 2 percent of the national budget. In spite of such constitutional provision, this&#13;
share of funding was not received during the first 11 years after the enactment such Constitution. The&#13;
situation improved during 1990-93, when the average allocation of the national budget exceeded 2%&#13;
(peaking in 1990 at 2.45%). However, this ratio declined again in 1994-95. The actual Constitution&#13;
does not set a minimum share of the national budget to be assigned to the Judiciary.&#13;
1.23  The 1996 budget initially allocated to the Judiciary was 288 million soles (including 19 million&#13;
soles of the Judiciary's proper income), only 1.3% of the national budget. However, the Government&#13;
later authorized a 50% budgetary increase (by 144 million soles or approximately US$60 million) to&#13;
specifically finance the emergency program for administrative modernization that was initiated by the&#13;
Comision Ejecutiva in November 1995. For 1997, the budget allocated to the judiciary amounts to 315&#13;
million soles (including 22.5 million soles of proper income), 1.4% of the national budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
Efficiency&#13;
1.24   An imperative area for reform is the modernization of the operational and functional aspects of&#13;
the Judiciary. It is urgent to improve the efficiency in the sector administration, from the viewpoint of&#13;
the management of the overall judicial branch as well as case administration.&#13;
1.25 Administration of the Courts. Since 1991, some efforts have been made to improve the&#13;
overall administration of the courts, including administrative decentralization on a pilot basis, improved&#13;
planning, and the development of operational manuals covering budget, accounting, treasury, personnel&#13;
administration, and procurement etc. Although progress has been made, these measures were not&#13;
sufficient to achieve substantial improvements in the supply of court services.&#13;
1.26   An important step taken to improve the administration of courts was the separation of the&#13;
administrative functions from the judicial functions at the Supreme Court level. In 1992, the Organic&#13;
Law of the Judiciary was modified to provide for a Board (Consejo Ejecutivo) with responsibility for&#13;
the overall admninistration of the court system, and a judicial management office (Gerencia General de&#13;
Administracion) with professionals in the diverse areas of administration. Previously, the responsibility&#13;
to administer the Judiciary and its revenues had fallen to the Supreme Court justices who had neither&#13;
time, the training nor the inclination to properly manage the organization or the finances of the system.&#13;
This confusion of management and judicial duties resulted in very inefficient administration of the&#13;
courts.&#13;
1.27 The Board or Consejo Ejecutivo originally comprised five members: the President of the&#13;
Supreme Court, a Supreme Court justice selected by the plenary, the Chief of the Office of Supervision&#13;
of the Magistracy, a Superior Court judge elected by the Presidents of the Superior Courts and a&#13;
representative of the Bar Associations. This Board, now termed Comision Ejecutiva, has been&#13;
temporarily reduced to three Supreme Court members (the Presidents of three chambers of the Supreme&#13;
Court) and a general manager (Secretario Ejecutivo) by laws 26546 and 26623.4  The Secretario&#13;
Ejecutivo is the technical and administrative arm of the Judiciary. Before November 1995, this office&#13;
carried no voting power in the Board, but since then, it not only has such power but also retains&#13;
authority to decide budgetary allocations and expenditures. It was officially explained that this move&#13;
toward the limited membership of the policy-making body and the appointment of a manager with full&#13;
delegation of administrative authority is an attempt to improve administrative efficiency and implement&#13;
modernization of the Judiciary during the emergency reform period (1996-98). Upon assuming the&#13;
responsibility, the Comision Ejecutiva and the Secretario Ejecutivo adopted a series of measures to&#13;
address deep-seated problems in the sector, e.g., in the areas of the management of human and financial&#13;
resources, statistics and management information system, court automation, judicial process, courtroom&#13;
organization and infrastructure (paras. 1.32-1.33).&#13;
4  Law 26546 (November 1995) suspended the Consejo Ejecutivo and other administrative units and established a temporary&#13;
governing body with a one-year reform mandate-i.e.,the Comision Ejecutiva as a policy-making organ and an Secretario&#13;
Ejecutivo vwith full delegation of adminisve authority. In June 1996, such mandate was extended until end-1998 (law&#13;
26623).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
1.28 Financial Management. As previously noted, the Judiciary has been assigned a low priority in&#13;
the government's budget. Apart from the need for higher budget allocations, the Judiciary also must&#13;
make its own efforts to strengthen the financial base by improving budget planning and execution,&#13;
establishing a financial control system, and reinforcing its resource generating capacity. There is limited&#13;
use in the Judiciary of mechanisms to raise separate resources (from the charging of fees) and a&#13;
reluctance to implement such charges. In 1996, virtually all resources come directly from the treasury,&#13;
equal to approximately 93% of the total Judiciary budget (288 million soles of initial allocation). At&#13;
present, user fees are only charged on civil cases above 2,200 soles, while other claims and suits (such&#13;
as criminal, labor, agriculture, family and mixed) are free of charges. (Civil cases account for about&#13;
51% of the total cases; and those cases below 2,200 soles account for about 10% of the total civil&#13;
cases.)5 This system translates into real inequities as regards the treasury and public spending. The&#13;
Judiciary is a costly service for the state and thus private parties should contribute to its maintenance&#13;
unless there is a clear hindrance to access to justice. To achieve economic independence, the Judiciary&#13;
needs to strengthen its capacity to seek the resources required for meeting its judicial responsibilities,&#13;
use those resources prudently, and account for their use.&#13;
1.29 Case Administration. Regarding the processing of cases, substantial case delays and backlogs&#13;
are reported to exist in the courts in Peru. On average, a case under ordinary proceedings takes 3 years&#13;
(compared to a maximum of 300 days established in the code of civil procedure), and a case under&#13;
summary proceedings in the first instance takes 270 days (compared to 60 days prescribed in the&#13;
code)6. Fewer cases are resolved in a year than the total number of cases that enter the system in that&#13;
year. According to the most recent survey conducted by the Judiciary with the support of INEI, in&#13;
1995, 749,216 cases were filed while only 592,589 cases were resolved in the whole judicial system&#13;
(except for the Supreme Court); and at end-1995, there were 457,749 cases backlogged. In the Lima&#13;
district where one-third of the total cases are concentrated, 141,864 cases were backlogged at end-1995&#13;
(see Chart 1).&#13;
1.30 The above situation results, on the supply side, in large measure from an inefficient&#13;
administrative system for handling cases with the following main characteristics. First, the judicial&#13;
process is based on a judge-specific administrative system; every court has its own administrative office,&#13;
staffed by legal and administrative clerks. There is no centralized caseload management system in the&#13;
court system. Second, there is confusion of judicial and managerial duties. Judges must play a dual role&#13;
in their daily duties as dispensers of justice and administrators of their own courts. Judges are involved&#13;
in personnel management, the management of financial resources, the management of judicial deposits&#13;
and coordination of process servers and clerks. This duality is a major cause of court backlogs. Third,&#13;
there exists no standard guidelines on critical issues such as the numbering of case files, the&#13;
determination of the number and location of registries on court actions, methods for handling exhibits&#13;
and records security. Lastly, there is no reliable information system on which to base decisions related&#13;
to both the administration of the system and the management of the flow of cases (e.g., financial and&#13;
personnel statistics, jurisprudence and case statistics, access to case management information).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
1.31   Physical Infrastructure. Over the past years, the quality of the physical infrastructure within&#13;
the Judiciary has deteriorated and failed to keep pace with the expansion of the population and the&#13;
judicial system. The preliminary assessment at selected judicial districts suggests that regarding central&#13;
buildings where appellate courts, part of the first instance courts (most of the specialized courts and a&#13;
small number of Juzgados de Paz Letrados), and administrative offices are located, the main problems&#13;
are: (i) the inefficient utilization of facilities due to lack of overall planning of functions and available&#13;
space, and (ii) outdated facilities. There is a lack of modem office technology, information and&#13;
communications, modem archives, and security safeguards. Increased caseloads, security issues,&#13;
modem court technology and court organization, the movement toward oral hearings, and the&#13;
decentralization of administrative functions are creating a series of design problems that must be&#13;
addressed. Furthermore, in the case of courts for Jueces de Paz Letrados, the centralization of court&#13;
facilities is a serious problem, and there is a need to decentralize these courts in order to improve&#13;
access for a large segment of the population.&#13;
1.32 Recent Reforms. The Judiciary has recently undertaken initiatives to remedy this dismal picture.&#13;
Immediately assuming the responsibility in end-November 1995, the Comision Ejecutiva, and their team&#13;
elaborated a strategic action plan for 1996 and initiated a series of new and bold initiatives in the areas of&#13;
human resource management, financial management, modernization of court organization and process&#13;
optiiization, statistical updates, backlog reduction, improvement in institutional image, and infrastructure&#13;
improvement. The reform objectives spelled out in the strategic action plan are: to lay the grounds for a&#13;
irreversible modernization and optimization of the administrative support system of the Judiciary to achieve&#13;
effective, timely, and fair justice administration; to introduce efficient administrative and judicial processes,&#13;
which should be implemented by qualified and disciplined personnel, with the support of infonnation and&#13;
technology; and to improve the image and the political and economic autonomy of the Judiciary.&#13;
1.33  The major actions taken by the Judiciary authorities to date include the following:&#13;
* Human resource management: (i) modifying the existing employment practices to increase&#13;
transparency, e.g., by terminating judges' family members occupying clerical positions and prohibiting&#13;
the employment of non-salaried clerical staff, (ii) introducing a scheme of productivity bonus by&#13;
using the Judiciary's own income; (iii) defining the number of administrative positions required and&#13;
developing job descriptions, reducing the redundancy of administrative personnel through a voluntary&#13;
retirement program, and recruiting new personnel through competitive examinations; (iv) advancing&#13;
administrative decentralization by nominating General Managers at each district, selected through&#13;
competitive examination; (v) introducing the private sector labor regime for administrative and&#13;
auxiliary personnel to increase the flexibility in labor contracts; and (vi) reinforcing a disciplinary&#13;
system by strengthening the Oficina de Control de los Magistrados of the Judiciary and establishing&#13;
district-level disciplinary commissions chaired by respective Superior Court Presidents.&#13;
* Financial management: (i) reviewing the existing fee structures and examining options for&#13;
strengthening the Judiciary's income base; and (ii) analyzing the feasibility of contracting out selected&#13;
administrative and judicial services (e.g., cleaning, security, logistics, notification) to increase the&#13;
efficiency and quality of these services. The authorities plan to create a superintendency of legal&#13;
services to supervise the implementation; the superintendency would be also responsible for fee&#13;
collection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
* Reorganization and process optimization: (i) introducing standard formats regarding court&#13;
administration and developing operational manuals; (ii) developing a new model of court organization&#13;
(e.g., 'sistema corporativo' or the creation of a centralzed unit for registry and document processing)&#13;
to change the current judge-specific administrative system into a more impersonal one; (iii) designing&#13;
and installing, on a pilot basis, a computerized document registry system, and initiating the design of a&#13;
case management system; and (iv) conducting a comprehensive statistical update of the entire districts&#13;
in collaboration with INEI (National Statistical Institute) and compiling the Judicial Statistics for&#13;
1995. The computerized document registry system and new court organization were tested in a few&#13;
criminal courts in Lima from August, and then introduced in civil courts in Chiclayo (the Lambayeque&#13;
district) in November 1996. The Judiciary authorities plan to implement such court automation in the&#13;
other districts in a phased manner, aiming at the completion of the nation-wide installation by end-&#13;
1998.&#13;
* Backlog reduction: creating transitory courts to eliminate cases pending as of end-1995 (to be&#13;
completed by end-1996), including 2 supreme transitory crimiinal courts, 14 superior transitory courts&#13;
(criminal, labor and mixed), and 80 first-instance courts (criminal, civil, labor, and basic justice).&#13;
According to the Judiciary's statistics, in less than a year, in Lima, all backlogs as of end-1995&#13;
(137,000 cases) were resolved.&#13;
O Improving the image of the Judiciary: (i) improving public attention; (ii) taking measures to&#13;
strengthen the security of the existing court facilities; and (iii) conducting public opinion surveys as&#13;
instrument to obtain feedback to the recently initiated reforms and identify areas where further efforts&#13;
are required.&#13;
* Infrastructure modernization: (i) designing a model courtroom, taking account of the proposed new&#13;
court organization, security and technology aspects; and (ii) undertaking the civil work identified as&#13;
priority in 1996, such as the remodeling of the central building (Palacio de Justicia) and civil, labor,&#13;
and criminal courthouses in Lima and the design study for the construction of central buildings in the&#13;
Cono Norte and Tacna districts--in both cases, adopting the new model of courtroom.&#13;
Access&#13;
1.34 General. Access to justice is severely limited for a large segment of Peruvians. Principal&#13;
barriers include physical access, high economic costs, lengthy and inefficient court procedures and&#13;
cultural barriers. First, the geographical coverage of the judicial system is very irregular. This has been&#13;
recognized by the President of the Supreme Court in his inaugural address of 1996 as the main barrier&#13;
of access to justice. The ratio of judges per inhabitant varies widely across judicial districts with no&#13;
relation at all to economic base or level of cases. High direct and indirect costs increase the difficulties&#13;
of access for the poor to the judicial system. Also, Peru is a very heterogeneous country with 5.1&#13;
million of indigenous population (such as quechas, aimaras, and amazonicos) or 22% of the total&#13;
population. These people may be intimidated not only by the unfamiliarity of the court system, but also&#13;
by the language barrier.&#13;
1.35   Efforts have been made in recent times to improve access of justice in particular regarding&#13;
decentralization of courts, modernization of the legislation for civil procedures, strengthening the public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
defenders office and legal aid clinics and increased support for the justices of peace. The Judiciary has&#13;
embarked on a plan to decentralize court services by opening new courts closer to low-income&#13;
populations.&#13;
1.36 Judicial Process. A new civil procedural code replacing the Civil Proceedings Code of 1912&#13;
went into effect on July 28, 1993. This new code is designed to facilitate access to justice through its&#13;
endorsement of the guiding principles of judicial management of trial, immediacy, concentration and&#13;
procedural economy. In application of these principles, the judge is afforded increased authority over&#13;
the conduct of the proceedings, parties will have a more direct contact with the judges, procedural acts&#13;
are simplified and superfluous formalities are eliminated. While the previous code contained more than&#13;
100 different procedures, the new code reduces the number to six. Another significant change has been&#13;
to assign the Supreme Court the role of a court of cassation and thus reduce the number of appeals to&#13;
the highest court. Though the new code intends to facilitate the adjudication of disputes, in practice this&#13;
has proven very difficult as a result of the insufficient number of judges, the inefficient administration of&#13;
the courts, and the lack of proper training of judges and other judicial personnel.&#13;
1.37 Alternative Disvute Resolution. Some alternative dispute resolution methods have become&#13;
more available in recent times. This has increased the "supply" of services to satisfy the need of society&#13;
for prompt, effective and suitable means of conflict settlement. A new arbitration law was enacted in&#13;
1992, and modified in 1995, and there exists about eight arbitrage centers. The new civil procedural&#13;
code requires the judge to seek, at the outset of a lawsuit, a conciliation between the parties by&#13;
proposing formulas for reconciling their differences and arriving at an amicable solution to their conflict.&#13;
However, the problems mentioned in the previous paragraph prevent the full benefit of this new feature&#13;
in civil proceedings. Dejudicialization measures have been taken recently, including the assumption by&#13;
notaries of several non-contentious matters which were previously handled by civil judges. In the area&#13;
of consumer protection and intellectual property, INDECOPI has a very successful record in its&#13;
conciliatory mechanisms for dispute settlement. Also, there is some NGO activity in the area of&#13;
mediation and conciliation. While alternative dispute resolution mechanisms outside the formal system&#13;
are legally available in Peru, these mechanisms are not widely used by the public thus forcing the parties&#13;
into the formal system to resolve disputes. Strengthening ADR is expected to promote access to justice&#13;
and result in decongestion of the formal court system.&#13;
1.38  An important institution to promote access to justice is the Ombudsman or Defensoria del&#13;
Pueblo. Ombudsmen have been recently appointed in many countries responding to the increased&#13;
* complexity in the relations between the State and private parties and the inability of the public sector to&#13;
satisfy the growing demands for protection of the rights of citizens. As previously stated, the&#13;
Defensoria del Pueblo in Peru is charged with the investigation of claims by citizens against the public&#13;
administration, to solve disputes in government matters and help establish accountability by the&#13;
government for its actions. The Defensor del Pueblo was appointed in April 1996, and the office&#13;
became operational in September 1996.&#13;
1.39  Basic Justice. A most outstanding institution in Peru are the justices of peace. They constitute&#13;
a first instance of conflict resolution for the average Peruvian citizen especially in the rural areas. The&#13;
number and location of the justices of peace is determined by the Superior Courts in each judicial&#13;
district. There are two types of justices of peace: Jueces de Paz Letrados (legally trained justices of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
peace) and Jueces de Paz (lay justices of peace). Jueces de Paz Letrados act as small claims courts with&#13;
competence over both civil and some minor criminal matters. As of end-1996, there are approximately&#13;
337 Jueces de Paz Letrados, and it is expected that this number will increase in the next year. Many of&#13;
the Jueces de Paz Letrados who are appointed have never been in the judicial system and have little&#13;
experience both in substantive legal matters as well as in conciliation techniques. In fact, currently there&#13;
is no consistency in how these Jueces de Paz Letrados conduct conciliation hearings.&#13;
1.40 Jueces de Paz (lay judges) are approximately 4,300 and account for almost 80% of justices in&#13;
Peru. They are basically conciliation justices who administer justice ex aequo et bono, based on their&#13;
best knowledge and understanding. They are generally persons with great respect and influence in their&#13;
communities; the good neighbor. They speak the local languages and most of them have secondary&#13;
education. Several studies have shown that the public has more confidence in such a system than it does&#13;
in the formal justice system. (For example, the level of popular satisfaction with them is high at 60-70%,&#13;
in a sharp contrast to consistent lack of faith in the formal system.) Thus, this extension of popular&#13;
justice plays a critical role in access to justice in Peru particularly in regard to traditional and indigenous&#13;
communities.&#13;
1.41  Jueces de Paz neither obtain compensation for their services nor receive any state support for&#13;
administrative expenses in support of such services. Training opportunities are also limited; during the&#13;
1980s, these judges received some training, but this has been discontinued. Many of the Jueces de Paz&#13;
have little or no experience upon taking the office. Though the 1993 Constitution requires that the&#13;
Justices of Peace be elected by the communities, such selection system has not yet been implemented&#13;
and they continue to be appointed by the Superior Courts.&#13;
Professional Competence and Integrity&#13;
1.42  Peruvian judges are generally poorly educated and trained as reflected in the generally poor&#13;
quality, unpredictability and uncertainty of their rulings; lack of appropriate aptitudes and skills; and an&#13;
overall misguided concept of their role and mission as magistrates.&#13;
1.43  Decisions rendered by judges reflect a very formalistic judicial reasoning. Judges tend in general&#13;
to apply a very narrow and literal interpretation of the laws with disregard to the economic and social&#13;
impact of their judgments. A recent research study on more than 200 cases in the civil courts in Lima&#13;
confirms this reality when deciding cases involving extra-contractual liability (torts). Outcomes are also&#13;
uncertain with almost no development of guiding case law. Further, judges are unfamiliar with legal&#13;
developments in the business field such as competition law, banking and insurance law and securities&#13;
legislation.&#13;
1.44 Though uncertainty and unpredictability are not easily measurable, as Chart 2 shows, people&#13;
have little trust in the system--particularly those who participated in the judicial process. Moreover, it&#13;
has translated into a private sector largely mistrustful of the Judiciary. In a survey carried out in 1993 among&#13;
108 businessmen from companies with gross income equal or over US$1 million, 90%/O of those interviewed&#13;
said they would not utilize the judicial system for the resolution oftheir legal disputes. Also, 32% ofthem&#13;
7  These companies were involved in commerce acivities (39%), manufacture (39%), non-financial services (17%), and other&#13;
activities (39%). The most frequent conflicts companies face are collection of bills, disputes over conratual interpretation,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
responded that they are not interested in purchasing from new suppliers--even if they are offered much lower&#13;
prices (compared to their traditional suppliers)--because of the lack of reliable contract enforcement&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
1.45  Judges also show a poor preparation in judicial and practical skills. These include those related&#13;
to the procedure itself such as evaluation of evidence as well as other general matters as case flow&#13;
management, informatics, administration, etc. Most importantly, judges fail to view their role as a&#13;
public service to the people. There is a want of a "culture of service".&#13;
1.46  In the past, the Judiciary has undertaken training programs. In the 1970's, the then Comision de&#13;
Reforma Judicial embarked on an active and aggressive training effort aimed at instilling a more creative&#13;
mentality in the judges. In the 1980's important training activities were conducted for the justices of&#13;
peace.8 Recently, the predecessor of the Academia de la Magistratura also engaged in training efforts&#13;
to update the knowledge of judges in new legislative developments. However, the impact of those past&#13;
efforts has been adversely affected by the high turnover in the Judiciary in the last two decades for&#13;
political factors.&#13;
1.47 The training needs are profound and the new Academia de la Magistratura is well aware of the&#13;
challenge. It has become operational earlier this year and conducted several seminars with the newly&#13;
appointed superior judges and prosecutors, as well as a series of self-training programs ("auto-&#13;
capacitacion) for the existing judges in Lima, northern, and southern parts of the country. In the auto-&#13;
capacitacion programs, opinions were sought from judges on the ongoing reform process, and the need&#13;
to improve the existing court organization and process was discussed. The Academia has also&#13;
completed, with the funding of the Japanese PHRD grant, an initial needs assessment of the civil judges&#13;
in the Lima district. There are, however, much work and assistance required ahead for the Academia to&#13;
develop into a sustainable resource center for the improvement of the justice system. This will include&#13;
upgrading curriculum development, teaching methodologies and styles, development of personal&#13;
teaching tools and evaluation of training programs. Furthermore, with the recent modification to the&#13;
Organic Law of the CNM, the AM is now requested to provide effective assistance to the CNM in the&#13;
emergency, mass judicial selection, by offering training programs for aspiring judges (para. 1.19).&#13;
1.48  Ethics standards in the Judiciary requires a special consideration.  There is a widespread&#13;
perception in the public of pervasive corruption in the judiciary. Ethics was a point emphasized by the&#13;
President of the Supreme Court in his inaugural address in 1996 and a recommendation was made to&#13;
adopt a Code of Judicial Ethics. In the workshops with judges and the training needs assessments&#13;
carried out by the Academia de la Magistratura, ethics was identified as a learning need.&#13;
1.49  Unethical behavior is much a cause as a result of the many problems in the Judiciary. There is a&#13;
need to develop clear ethical guidelines, provide training and ensure appropriate enforcement&#13;
labor related conflicts, and finally, civil and mercantile conficts. APOYO S.A. (1993), Actitudes Empresariales ante el&#13;
Poder Judicial.&#13;
8 Indeed, the Centro Judicial de Investigaciones (a research unit of the Judiciary),with the assistance of the Naumnman&#13;
Foundation, carried out more than 250 seminars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
mechanisms. At the same time, it must be recognized that a system with no tenure, low salaries and&#13;
great political interference encourages such behavior.&#13;
1.50. Recently, efforts have been made to correct unethical behavior. The most symbolic action was&#13;
the modification of the prevailing employment practices to increase transparency, e.g., by terminating&#13;
judges' family members occupying clerical positions and prohibiting the employment of non-salaried&#13;
clerical staff (para.1.33).   The function of the OCMA  has been also  strengthened.   Without&#13;
strengthening the values of ethics in the justice system, reform efforts will become futile and not&#13;
sustainable.&#13;

D. Judicial Reform Program and Recent Initiatives&#13;
1.51   As stated before, administrative modernization and reorganization of the Judiciary have gained new&#13;
dynamics with the passage of law 26546 in November 1995 (para. 1.27). Although this law initially gave the&#13;
Comision Ejecutiva only one-year to carry out reform in the administrative areas, last June such mandate was&#13;
extended until end-1998 and its scope was expanded to include jurisdictional reforms (law 26623).9 Since&#13;
January 1997, the Comision Ejecutiva has been presided by the President of the Supreme Court.&#13;
Furthermore, law 26623 provides for: (i) the creation of a Consejo de Coordinacion Judicial (CCJ), with a&#13;
broad representation of various interest groups, charged with strategic planning and policy coordination of&#13;
the justice sector; and (ii) the reorganization and modernization of the Public Ministry, thus extending the&#13;
reform to the criminal justice system. During the three-year reform period, the membership of the CCJ will&#13;
be restricted to three organizations, i.e., the Judiciary, the CNM, and the Public Ministry. Also, an office was&#13;
created within the CCJ to coordinate technical and financial cooperation with national and international&#13;
agencies.&#13;
1.52   The stated objectives of the CCJ are: to coordinate the general policy directions on the development&#13;
and organization of the institutions involved in the justice sector; to define strategies for permanent&#13;
collaboration and concerted efforts in the areas of modernization and efficiency improvement in judicial&#13;
services; to elaborate integral programs to modernize and reorganize procedures and administrative systems&#13;
for the institutions directly related and/or associated with the service of justice administration; and to support&#13;
efforts to improve the justice system in coordination with the related institutions such as Ministry of Justice,&#13;
Police, Defensoria del Pueblo, universities, private business, legal community, and international agencies.&#13;
1.53   Upon assuming the responsibility in last November, the Judiciary authorities launched wide-ranging&#13;
reform initiatives, primarily in the administrative areas (paras. 1.32-1.33). In August 1996, the Comision&#13;
Ejecutiva elaborated a document that outlines a strategic plan and the proposed reform program for 1996-98.&#13;
The document establishes three key objectives of the reform program: (i) to implement an efficient&#13;
administrative organization (e.g., by strengthening general administration, disciplinary function, and other&#13;
support services); (ii) to establish a modem court organization (e.g., through the implementation of backlog&#13;
reduction, new court organization, and alternative dispute resolution mechanism); and (iii) to optimize the&#13;
profile of judges (e.g., through the development of a judicial career system, improvement in incentive&#13;
systems, judicial training with increased emphasis on quality and efficiency). Under each objective, specific&#13;
time-bound work programs have been defined. Furthermore, during the recent months, there have been a&#13;
collaborative effort among the Judiciary, the AMK the CNM, and the DP to develop a vision and strategy of&#13;
the sector reform and clarify the responsibilities of respective institutions for achieving the shared vision (see&#13;
Annex 1 for the policy letter).&#13;
E. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.54   The project is consistent with the latest Country Assistance Strategy, presented to the Board in July&#13;
1997 (Report No. 16796-PE) and policy dialogue held with the Government at the time of the Bank&#13;
programming missions in the recent years. In particular, the project would assist in the process of&#13;
modernization of the state, improve public sector management in support of growth, assist in poverty&#13;
9  In December 1996, the Organic Law of the Judiciary was modified to accomodate these changes (law 26695). Law 26695&#13;
has established that from 1997, the Coniision Ejecutiva would be presided by the President of the Supreme Court.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
alleviation and provide better conflict resolution mechanisms for the private sector. The absence of a credible&#13;
and efficient judiciary and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms negatively affects the enabling&#13;
environment for private sector development, contributes to inequities in access to justice by the poor, and&#13;
potentially could contribute to political instability. Moreover, a stronger judiciary will serve better to&#13;
counteract corrupt and fraudulent practices in the public and private sectors. Bank support of the&#13;
Government's economic program in the areas of private sector development and the social sectors is&#13;
hampered by the lack of attention to problems in the judicial sector. While Peru has adopted a number of&#13;
necessary legal reforms, its capacity to implement those reforms remains inadequate. The Bank's expertise in&#13;
administrative strengthenng, its perceived objectivity in a sensitive area, and its support for the Government's&#13;
economic reform program provide the rationale for Bank involvement. Moreover, the Bank could play an&#13;
important role in helping the authorities: (i) elaborate and implement a medium-term reform program; (ii)&#13;
attain a smooth transition from the emergency situation and sustain the ongoing reform initiatives; and (iii)&#13;
ensure the integrity and consistency of recent reform initiatives by involving other key players (such as the&#13;
AM  and the CNM) in the project. During the discussions of the sector report in March 1995, the&#13;
Government agreed with many of the principal recommendations and the reform strategy outlined in the&#13;
report, and in separate discussions with the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Economy and Finance, and&#13;
then new President of the Supreme Court, strong positive feedback was provided for Bank assistance. This&#13;
was reiterated by the new team of the Judiciary, which considers Bank involvement in the sector at this&#13;
juncture critical to achieve smooth transition from current emergency efforts to longer-term, sustainable,&#13;
comprehensive reform. The existence of a new constitutional framework and improved legislation for the&#13;
sector including the administrative organization of the Judiciary, new legislation on civil procedure and&#13;
arbitration-together with increased recognition within the civil society on the need for judicial reform--&#13;
present a unique opportunity for accomplishing significant advances in the judicial sector.&#13;
F. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Experience&#13;
1.55   Since this project would represent the Bank's first operation in support of judicial reform in Peru, no&#13;
lessons of sectoral experience are available. Moreover, given the relative recent history of Bank involvement&#13;
in the judicial sector, there has not been much experience in the area from which to draw lessons, except for&#13;
Venezuela and Bolivia (under implementation) and Ecuador (recently approved by the Board). Experience&#13;
with the Venezuela Judicial Infrastructure Project suggests the desirability of prior strengthening of the&#13;
implementing agency and unit, especially given the limited experience in the judicial sector with project&#13;
planning and implementation; the establishment of a broad-based advisory commission to ensure&#13;
communication among agencies that affect and are affected by the project; and constant reinforcement of the&#13;
commitment and ownership of the project by the Government and the judicial sector. Recent Bank efforts in&#13;
Bolivia and in the preparation of the Ecuador Judicial Reform Project reinforce the need for these three&#13;
elements: (i) professional and functioning coordination units; (ii) the establishment of clear coordination&#13;
responsibilities across branches of Government; and (iii) commitment and understanding of changes by the&#13;
Judiciary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
IL THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Proiect Obiectives&#13;
2.1    The overall objective of the project is to assist the Borrower in improving the performance of its&#13;
justice system by enhancing, under the framework and terms of its sector strategy in the policy letter, its&#13;
access, quality, independence, efficiency and integrity. Specific objectives are to: (i) modernize the&#13;
administrative structure and operation of the Judiciary; (ii) improve the overall performance in civil and labor&#13;
courts in the selected districts; (iii) strengthen the CNM and consolidate and improve its merit-based system&#13;
of appointment, advancement and removal of magistrates; (iv) strengthen the AM and enhance the&#13;
professional competence of civil and labor judges in the selected districts; (v) strengthen OCMA's disciplinary&#13;
system to enhance accountability and integrity of judges; (vi) develop and strengthen alternative dispute&#13;
resolution methods; (vii) support the institutional development of the newly established Office of Public&#13;
Defender; and (viii) strengthen the capacity of civil society to analyze, monitor and demand judicial&#13;
performance. The achievement of these objectives would increase public trust and confidence in the justice&#13;
system, and thus improve the competitive environment for conflict resolution.&#13;
B. Proiect Descrigtion&#13;
2.2    To achieve the above objectives, the project would support key initiatives in the first stage of a&#13;
comprehensive and long-term reform program of the justice system. These key initiatives would improve the&#13;
"supply" of judicial services as well as strengthen "demand" for better judicial services--both within and&#13;
without the formal system. On the "supply" side, the project would strengthen basic institutions in the judicial&#13;
sector and support a set of focused, specific activities aimed at improving judicial performance at five selected&#13;
districts: Lima (including Cono Norte and Callao), Arequipa, Cusco, Lambayeque, and Piura. In this respect,&#13;
the project aims to create five "centers of excellence" showing short-term, tangible and measurable results&#13;
with demonstration effects to the rest of the judicial districts. In November 1996, the first, district-wide pilot&#13;
program for new court organization and procedures (backed by court automation) was inaugurated in the&#13;
civil courts in Chiclayo, capital city of the Lambayeque judicial district. A phased, pilot approach would be&#13;
taken, and the experience of the Lambayeque pilot (medium-size) would be evaluated and disseminated&#13;
before the pilot is replicated in the other selected judicial districts. On the "demand" side, the project would&#13;
support greater public demand and accessibility to judicial services through the strengthening of the Justice of&#13;
Peace and the ombudsman's office (Defensor del Pueblo) and a demand-driven "Access Fund" to promote&#13;
ADR initiatives and other innovative activities to develop the capacity of the civil society for analyzing,&#13;
demanding and monitoring judicial performance.&#13;
2.3    The project would finance consulting services and studies, training and seminars, goods and&#13;
equipment, and physical infrastructure of the following three integrated components: (i) administration of&#13;
justice (US$18.1 million or 62% of total base costs); (ii) judicial selection, evaluation and training (US$3.7&#13;
million or 13% of total base costs), and (iii) access to justice (US$5.0 million or 17% of total base costs).&#13;
Total project costs are estimated to be US$31.6 million, including price and physical contingencies (total base&#13;
costs $29.2 million; see summary cost tables, Annex 10). Specific component activities are summarized&#13;
below. (The detailed description of the component activities are provided in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
Component I: Adminis*ation of Justice&#13;
2.4   The objectives of this component are to assist in: (i) modernizing the administrative apparatus of the&#13;
Judiciary and make it more effective and self-sustainable; and (ii) improving judicial performance in selected&#13;
districts through key activities related to its efficiency, equity and predictability.&#13;
Subcomponent 1: Modernization of the Administrative Apparatus of the Judiciary. This subcomponent&#13;
would assist in deepening the ongoing reforms by the Judiciary authorities in the following three areas:&#13;
Admnistrative strengthening of district offices: (i) providing training to administrative personnel of the&#13;
General Administration Offices (at 25 judicial districts nationwide), who have been recently recruited&#13;
through competitive examination, to upgrade their skills in such areas as: planning and management,&#13;
operational procedures, statistics and information, computer skills etc.; (ii) conducting a study to review&#13;
and refine the recently established administrative system and developing operational manuals; (iii)&#13;
supporting the development and implementation of management information systems for the General&#13;
Administration Offices in the areas of human resource, finance and procurement and the provision of&#13;
informatic equipment to support general and court administration (nationwide); and (iv) conducting&#13;
workshops for administrative personnel at the General Administration Offices and courts to discuss&#13;
bottlenecks and improvement plans for administrative modernization.&#13;
* Financial management: (i) conducting studies on feasibility and alternative ways to strengthen economic&#13;
autonomy of the Judiciary, including new forns of resource generation, costs of judicial services, and&#13;
improved judicial fee systems; (ii) strengthening the capacity of the General Administration Office for the&#13;
elaboration and execution of program-based budget; and (iii) designing and implementing a preferential&#13;
fee scheme for low-income groups.&#13;
* Institutional image of the Judiciary: (i) supporting the dissenination of the Judiciary's reforms through&#13;
public campaign (e.g., through radio and television spots); and (ii) conducting a series of evaluation&#13;
studies on the administrative reforms being carried out (e.g., opinion surveys of litigants, lawyers, judges&#13;
and court personnel).&#13;
Subcomoponent 2: Court Performance Improvement Pilots. This subcomponent is designed to improve the&#13;
quality, predictability and timeliness of judicial decision-making in the selected districts through the&#13;
implementation of key activities in a participatory manner. These activities focus on improving the&#13;
predictability of decisions of judges, court procedures and organization ('sistema corporativo'), court&#13;
automation and infrastructure remodeling (see below). In addition judicial training activities (component 2)&#13;
will also focus on these selected districts. Specific key activities have already commenced in civil courts of&#13;
the Lambayeque district in November 1996 in the areas of the introduction of new court procedures and&#13;
organization, court automation, infrastructure remodeling, and training of judges and court personnel in&#13;
informatic skills and case administration. (Prior to this district-wide implementation in Lambayeque, during&#13;
August-October 1996 the Judiciary team experimented the proposed new court procedures and organization,&#13;
as well as the software system of the first-stage court automation in selected courts in Lima (i.e., anti-drug&#13;
courts and transitory courts)). Upon satisfactory evaluation of the Lambayeque pilot, the implementation of&#13;
the pilot program will expand to other selected districts in a phased manner. To this end, two teams have&#13;
been recently set up within the Judiciary to plan and implement pilot programs (outside Lima) in collaboration&#13;
with respective districts. The experience of the Lambayeque pilot would be evaluated and the lessons gained&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
would be incorporated into the subsequent pilots in the other districts of similar size (see Annex 8 for the&#13;
description of a typical pilot program). Due to its very large size and complexity, the Lima pilot would be&#13;
treated separately from those of the above medium-size districts. A team has been set up to exclusively focus&#13;
on the preparation and implementation of the Lima program.&#13;
* Civil and labor judgments. (i) conducting national and regional forums (plenarios) with civil and labor&#13;
judges to discuss specific judgments in civil and labor matters, share experience and knowledge among&#13;
the judges, and make recommendations to uniformize case law on specific legal issues; (ii) developing&#13;
innovative incentive schemes for judges, i.e., the dissemination of the work of judges and researchers&#13;
through the publication of journals and annual reports, research competition, and the conduct of study&#13;
tours; and (iii) expansion of court libraries in the selected districts.&#13;
* Court procedure and organization: (i) pilot implementation of a new court organization and simplified,&#13;
standardized case processing procedures (starting from the Lambayeque district), introducing fine-tuning&#13;
measures as required, and expanding the new organization and procedures to the remaining selected&#13;
districts in a phased way. This exercise would include training of judges and auiliary court personnel on&#13;
case administration and information skills, public campaign, evaluation (through statistical verification,&#13;
workshops, and surveys on users and judges), as well as court automation and infrastructure remodeling&#13;
(see the separate section below); (ii) conducting regional workshops for judges to evaluate the impact and&#13;
results of the application of the new code of civil procedures, deepen the understanding of court&#13;
procedures, and make recommendations for further improvements; (iii) organizing workshops and&#13;
surveys with the representatives of the civil society to evaluate the progress of new court organization&#13;
and the implementation of the new civil procedure code; and (iv) conducting studies on quantitative and&#13;
qualitative indicators to measure performance improvements of civil and labor courts and disseminating&#13;
the results at workshops with judges (on an annual basis). The studies would include the process time,&#13;
the volume of cases disposed per court, costs of judicial administration, and be used as a tool to monitor&#13;
improvements in judicial performance in the selected districts.&#13;
* Judicial information system and statistics: (i) design of an automated caseflow management system, the&#13;
pilot implementation of an integrated judicial information system in Lambayeque and its evaluation, and&#13;
subsequent expansion of the system to the other selected districts in a phased way; (ii) conducting a&#13;
diagnostic study of the existing judicial statistics system (including identification of key statistical&#13;
indicators) and implementing improvement plans, so that key administrative and jurisdictional data,&#13;
necessary for operations and decision making, can be provided timely and accurately; (iii) development of&#13;
multiple data base (both legislation and cases); (iv) design and implementation of a modern archive&#13;
system in the selected districts; and (v) automation of courts through the purchase of basic automation&#13;
equipment-PCs, printers, basic software, and other equipment for the selected pilot districts (except for&#13;
Lima where the purchase of these equipment is underway).&#13;
* Infrastructure remodeling: The project would finance the remodeling of physical facilities in the selected&#13;
districts (i.e., central buildings) so that infrastructure investment could go hand in hand with&#13;
administrative and judicial modernization efforts. The Judiciary has already developed a concept of&#13;
model courtroom (or new court organization), which takes account of improved processes, modem&#13;
technology, and security considerations. The remodeling works will be implemented by the architectural&#13;
unit of the Judiciary. During preappraisal, the unit costs of the proposed remodeling (per m2) were&#13;
reviewed and judged satisfactory. Infrastructure remodeling would be financed entirely with local&#13;
counterpart funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Component 2: Judicial Selection, Evaluation and Training&#13;
2.5    This component aims, through integrated efforts of the CNM, the AM  and the Judiciary, at (i)&#13;
establishing and maintaining a merit-based judicial career system; and (ii) improving judicial ethics and&#13;
accountability. This should result in an improvement of professional competence, ethical standards and&#13;
legitimacy of judges and other court personmel..&#13;
Subcomponent 1: Judicial Selection and Evaluation. This subcomponent would support the CNM through:&#13;
(i) developing, upgrading and refining its regulations, procedures and systems for selection, removal, and&#13;
ratification of judges and strengthening its organizational structure accordingly; (ii) strengthening its strategic&#13;
planning and management capacity through the implementation of diagnostic studies, the development of&#13;
organizational visions and action plans, and expert advice; (iii) providing the CNM members with training on&#13;
management and informatics skills; (iv) conducting studies on the profile of judges, the profile of the CNM&#13;
staff, and ethical standards in the Judiciary; and (v) providing informatic and other logistic support, including&#13;
the development of data bases in support of the selection, removal, and ratification functions.&#13;
Subcomponent 2: Judicial Training. This subcomponent would assist the AM in the initial institutional&#13;
development and the implementation of comprehensive and integrated training programs for civil and labor&#13;
judges in the selected districts to upgrade their judicial skills and aptitudes, strengthen their knowledge in&#13;
selected areas of primarily business law matters, improve ethical standards and instill a "culture of service".&#13;
An initial training needs assessment conducted in the Lima judicial district (with the Japanese PHRD grant&#13;
financing) shows as priority learning needs: (a) judicial skills such as judicial reasoning, legal writing,&#13;
evaluation of evidence, conciliation techniques, court administration, etc.;. (b) legal knowledge such as tax&#13;
matters, capital markets, competition law, banking law, insurance law, negotiable instruments,&#13;
extracontractual liability (torts) and measurement of damages; and (c) attitudes as mission and role of the&#13;
judge in society, attitude or culture of service, treatment of minorities, etc. Project financing would include:&#13;
(i) the design and implementation of arnual training programs for the judges appointed by the CNM (e.g.,&#13;
needs assessments, curriculum and module design, training materials, honorarium, training of trainers,&#13;
distance training, and logistic support); (ii) evaluation studies of impact and results of the training programs;&#13;
and (iii) institutional strengthening of the AM (e.g., consultancy for designing intensive training programs for&#13;
aspiring judges, judicial selection by the CNM, study tours for the AM staff, and the support to publications).&#13;
These activities would complement the support received by the AM from the European Union&#13;
(approximately US$1 million in grant) in the areas of the Academia's library, the contracting of professors for&#13;
specific training courses (including non-civil matters and with emphasis in districts other than Lima and&#13;
aspiring judges and prosecutors), and the purchase of informatic and office equipment.&#13;
Subcomponent 3: Disciplinary System. This subcomponent aims at strengthening the disciplinary system of&#13;
the OCMA (Oficina de Control de los Magistrados; internal control unit of the Judiciary). Project financing&#13;
would include: (i) the conduct of a diagnostic study of its organization, particularly in light of the OCMA's&#13;
recent decentralization efforts (i.e., the creation of district-level disciplinary commissions), and support to the&#13;
implementation of the study's recommendations; (ii) the refinement of the legal framework for a monitoring&#13;
and control system; (iii) training of the OCMA staff, including needs assessment, workshops and annual&#13;
training seminars, study tours; (iv) dissemination of OCMA's activities; and (v) informatic and other&#13;
equipment support for the decentralized, district-level disciplinary commissions. Because of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
complementary role of the CNM and the OCMA in the evaluation and the control of judges' performance,&#13;
the activity (i)-(ii) would be carried out in close coordination with the subcomponent 1.&#13;
Component 3: Access to Justice&#13;
2.6    This component aims at improving access to justice in a broad sense by: (i) providing training for&#13;
justices of peace (i.e., lay judges) and community authorities on conciliation and mediation techniques and&#13;
refining the legal and regulatory framework for their activities; (ii) establishing and operating a demand-driven&#13;
Access Fund to promote altemative means of dispute resolution and to strengthen the capacity of civil&#13;
society for analyzing, demanding and monitoring judicial performance; and (iii) supporting the initial&#13;
institutional development and key selected activities of the newly created Office of Public Defender (DP).&#13;
The component is complementary to the proposed IDB project (estimated at up to US$20 million), which&#13;
would primarily focus on training, courtroom modernization and infrastructure improvement for the Jueces&#13;
de Paz Letrado (legally-trained judges).&#13;
Subcomponent 1: Support to the Jueces de Paz System. This subcomponent would support: (i) the design&#13;
and implementation of training programs for Jueces de Paz (lay judges, popularly elected under the new&#13;
constitutional system) and community authorities, who provide an important mechanism for access to justice&#13;
of the poorest people in the urban and the rural areas; (ii) the implementation of baseline studies of Jueces de&#13;
Paz and user surveys (before and after training programs); and (iii) the review and refinement of the existing&#13;
laws and regulations of the Jueces de Paz. The activities (i) and (ii) would focus on the selected districts.&#13;
- Design and implementation of trainingprograms: (i) the development of training modules for training of&#13;
trainers (about 30 local trainers, each for Jueces de Paz and local authorities) and their selection criteria,&#13;
the provision of training for trainers in the skills of adult education and mediation and conciliation; (ii) the&#13;
preparation of training materials; (iv) the irnplementation of training programs for conciliation in the&#13;
selected districts; and (v) the evaluation of training programs (their impact, content, methodology,&#13;
materials etc.) with the participation of trainers, professionals, universities, NGOs, and the AM etc.&#13;
3 Performance evaluation of Jueces de Paz: (i) initial baseline and follow-up surveys (before and after the&#13;
implementation of training) in selected districts, covering types of cases, time delay, form of conflict&#13;
resolution etc., and the dissemination of the survey results through workshops; and (ii) client surveys--&#13;
similarly before and after the implementation of training. The results of both baseline and client surveys&#13;
would be discussed at the time of evaluation of training programs (see above (v)).&#13;
* Analysis of legislafion and regulations on Jueces de Paz: (i) the review of the existing legislation and&#13;
norms on Jueces de Paz by establishing working groups and make proposals for improvements; and (ii)&#13;
public dissemination of the proposals through workshops to forge consensus on legal and regulatory&#13;
changes.&#13;
Subcomponent 2: Access Fund. This subcomponent would help improve access to justice through the&#13;
creation of a demand-driven fund to finance eligible subprojects aimed at: (i) promoting ADR mechanisms&#13;
(e.g., setting up mediation centers, training mediators and arbitrators, development of training materials and&#13;
requirements to be a mediator or arbitrator, etc.); and (ii) strengthening the capacity of civil society for&#13;
analyzing, demanding and monitoring judicial performance. The proposed subprojects would be non-profit&#13;
and items eligible for financing would be technical assistance activities. The Access Fund would be&#13;
administered by the PCU through a management committee (comprising of the representatives of the PJ,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
CNM, AM and DP). The management committee, in consultation with the advisory panel, would evaluate&#13;
and approve subprojects based on rules and procedures to form part of the operational manual. In order to&#13;
promote the participation of the civil society in the reform process, proposals would be sought widely from&#13;
NGOs, bar associations, law schools, and other private and academic groups. Successful subprojects would&#13;
be evaluated upon completion to assess their replicability. It is envisaged that the Access Fund would have a&#13;
national coverage to assure that the large number of organizations and groups be given a chance to&#13;
participate in the reform process. In this way, the Access Fund would complement the administration of&#13;
justice component which would focus on strengthening of central administrative apparatus of the Judiciary&#13;
and court performance improvement activities in the selected districts. The draft operational guideline for the&#13;
Access Fund was reviewed during negotiations. The adoption of the operational guidelines. acceptable to the&#13;
Bank would constitute a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
Subcomponent 3: Support to the Office of Public Defender (DP). This subcomponent would support the&#13;
institutional development of the DP in the areas of: (i) its organizational structure and functions, norms and&#13;
procedures (through advisory services, strategic workshops, evaluation studies, and staff training and study&#13;
tours); (ii) native communities, environmental protection, and citizen rights in the market economy (through&#13;
studies and workshops), as well as the organization of the forum to promote the coordination between the&#13;
state and civil society; (iii) public campaign and dissemination of DP activities, including the preparation and&#13;
distribution of materials in native languages and regional workshops; and (iv) other logistic and informatic&#13;
support to promote the decentralization of DP offices.&#13;
2.7   In addition, the project would provide consultant services, goods and training for the implementation&#13;
and supervision of the project, and canrying out of effective coordination and performance monitoring&#13;
activities.&#13;
D. Proiect Costs and Financin2&#13;
2.8   Total project costs are estimated at US$31.6 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component&#13;
of US$5.4 million, or 17% of project costs. Project costs include US$2.3 million for physical (US$1.3&#13;
million) and price (US$1.0 million) contingencies. The proposed loan of US$22.5 million equivalent would&#13;
finance approximate 71% of total project costs, net of taxes and duties, and the balance, US$9.1 million&#13;
equivalent, or 290/o of the project costs, would be financed by the Judiciary, the CNM, the AM, and the DP&#13;
through their respective budgetary appropriations, as well as by the beneficiaries of the Access Fund as their&#13;
local contributions. The IDB has been providing a technical assistance grant (US$1.4 million from MIF) for&#13;
ADR and is also in the process of preparing a project, to be supported with a loan estimated at up to $20&#13;
million, to support the judicial sector. There has been close coordination between the Bank and the IDB&#13;
during preparation, including joint missions and workshops. The IDB project would focus on the justice of&#13;
peace system (Jueces de Paz Letrado) including training and courtroom modernization and infrastructure&#13;
improvement in decentralized Juzgados de Paz that are not covered under the Bank project. The USAID has&#13;
been involved in the judicial sector through its Administration of Justice Program; however, virtually all of its&#13;
activities have been focused on the criminal justice system. Furthermore, UNDP has provided some technical&#13;
assistance funding in the design and preparation of several judicial sector activities, principally in the area of&#13;
informatics development. UNDP has also been providing technical support in the administration of the&#13;
Japanese PHRD Grant; however, limited funding beyond design assistance is available from this source.&#13;

m. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Status of Preparation&#13;
3.1   Project preparation benefited greatly from a Japanese PHRD grant in an amount of 57.6 million Yen.&#13;
The grant financed a series of workshops aimed at consensus building ofjudicial reform, training needs&#13;
assessment of civil judges in Lima, pilot training program for new civil procedural code for judges in Lima,&#13;
design and evaluation of a new court organization model, study tours for the professionals in the Judiciary,&#13;
AM, and CNM. It has also supported the Project Preparation Unit within the Judiciary in the conduct of&#13;
diagnostic studies and the design of component activities in collaboration with the other executing organs.&#13;
B. Institutional and LeMal Arrangements&#13;
3.2    There are four implementing agencies for the project: the Judiciary (through the Executive&#13;
Commission and OCMA), the AM, the CNM, and the DP. Because the project is a first major loan for the&#13;
sector and in light of their unfamiliarity with Bank operations and weak institutional capacity, the Project&#13;
Preparation Unit (PPU) was established within the Judiciary with the responsibility for executing the Japanese&#13;
grant for the formulation of the Bank project--in collaboration with the other relevant parties--and&#13;
coordinating the support from other donors.10 During the project implementation, this office will be&#13;
reinforced as the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), headed by a Project Director and assisted by two project&#13;
officers responsible for monitoring the execution of the PJ, AM, CNM, and DP components and a finance&#13;
and accounting officer. To ensure inter-institutional coordination, a Steering Committee will be established&#13;
with the participation of the representatives of the implementing agencies, and the PCU will serve as&#13;
secretariat to the Committee.&#13;
3.3    The Government has decided to contract a management agency to administer the contracts and&#13;
disbursements in light of the limited capacity of the implementing agencies and for reasons of transparency.&#13;
The Government has proposed, and the Bank has agreed, to use UJNDP as the management agency."&#13;
UNDP will administer the contracts under a "cost-sharing" arrangement and disburse directly to consultants,&#13;
according to the terms of their respective contracts (signed by respective implementing agencies and&#13;
authorized by the PCU).&#13;
3.4   The following legal arrangements will be executed in connection with the project. A loan agreement&#13;
will be executed between the Bank and the Republic of Peru and project agreements will be executed with&#13;
CNM and DP respectively. For purposes of transferring the respective portion of the Bank loan proceeds, a&#13;
subsidiary agreement will be signed with each of CNM, AM and DP. Execution of such subsidiary&#13;
agreements will constitute a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
10 Resolucion Administrativa #092-95-CD-PJ, October, 1995.&#13;
Decreto Supremo #132-92-EF authonzes the UNDP office/lima to provide such suppot, on the basis of the decision made by&#13;
respective sector authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
3.5   In order to strengthen capacity in dealing with procurement activities, key staff in the implementing&#13;
agencies and the PCU would be trained and be familiarized with Bank norms and procedures. Consultants'&#13;
services to be financed by the loan will be selected and contracted by the implementing agencies in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants (August 1981), except for the development of&#13;
selected softwares for the administration ofjustice 2, which will be financed by the Government from its own&#13;
counterpart funds and contracted according to its local procedures. During negotiations, agreements were&#13;
reached that standard forms of contract and model letters of invitation acceptable to the Bank would be used&#13;
for hiring of consultant services and that the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) would be used in&#13;
all applicable cases of procurement of goods and works. Such standard forms, model letters and standard&#13;
bidding documents will form part of the Operational Manual. Changes needed to suit project requirements&#13;
would be approved by the Bank.&#13;
3.6   Procurement of goods would be carried out in accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines&#13;
(January 1995 as revised in January and August, 1996). Infonnatic equipment (including hardware, first-&#13;
three year of maintenance, and basic training needed by the judicial information system subcomponent) would&#13;
be packaged into 1 or 2 contracts of US$250,000 or more and be procured under international competitive&#13;
bidding (ICB) procedures. Other isolated computers, software, and office/specialized equipment would be&#13;
procured using LIB among suppliers with service and maintenance facilities in Peru, for contracts valued at&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent or more up to a limnit of US$700,000. Small purchases of library books and other&#13;
supplies would be made using shopping procedures, requifing at least three quotations from eligible suppliers,&#13;
for the individual contracts of less than US$25,000 each (national shopping) and less than US$50,000 each&#13;
(international shopping), up to an aggregate of US$100,000 respectively.&#13;
3.7   Civil works would be financed entirely by the Government from its own counterpart funds and&#13;
contracted according to its local procedures.&#13;
3.8   The Access Fund would finance subprojects which may include studies, training, dissemination, and&#13;
ADR promotion proposed by the eligible entities--i.e., universities, research institutes, bar associations,&#13;
business associations, NGOs, and other private organizations-with a maximum grant amount of $50,000 per&#13;
subproject and the possibility of multiple applications up to a maximum of US$200,000. Selection of&#13;
subprojects to be financed by the Fund would be carried out in accordance with eligibility criteria and&#13;
operational procedures set out in the operational guidelines satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
3.9    Bank Prior Review. The Bank will review and approve ex-ante all procurement documents and&#13;
decisions for ICB and LIB contracting. For consulting firms on contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent, and for individual consultants on contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000&#13;
equivalent, the Bank's prior review will cover only the tenrs of reference, single source contracting,&#13;
assignmients of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the Bank and amendments revising the contract&#13;
value over the agreed threshold. These prior review arrangemnents would ensure ex-ante review by the Bank&#13;
of about 55% of the total value of all Bank-financed contracts. Although this prior review coverage is&#13;
relatively low, it is acceptable in light of the good performance by UNDP and PPU in following Bank&#13;
12 Th=e include: the seco phase of case tang system, s cal inomkation system, manageent inifrmation ystem for&#13;
geneal adminstration, and multiple data base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
guidelines for selection of consultants under the Japanese PHRD grant. While this prior coverage is relatively&#13;
low, it is acceptable in light of the good performance of UNDP and PPU in following Bank guidelines under&#13;
the Japanese grant. All procurement documentation would also be subject to selective ex-post review by the&#13;
Bank and external auditors.&#13;

3.11   Retroactive Financin. Retroactive financing of up to US$2 million would be provided to meet&#13;
expenditures incurred between January 1, 1997 and date of loan signing (provided that this period does not&#13;
exceed one year), mainly to finance: (i) court performance improvement pilots in the selected districts (e.g.,&#13;
public campaign and seminars on the introduction of new court procedures and organization, evaluation&#13;
studies and workshops of the pilot experiences, training of court administration and basic informatics skills);&#13;
(ii) studies to review the recently established administrative system and to strengthen economic autonomy of&#13;
the Judiciary; (iii) baseline studies of Jueces de Paz and user surveys; (iv) consultancy for the AM in the&#13;
design of training programs for aspiring judges; (v) initial institutional development of DP; and (vi) and the&#13;
other areas as judged necessary.&#13;
3.12 Documentation of Expenditures. Disbursement for goods and equipments under contracts below&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent and technical assistance and training under contracts below US$100,000 for firms and&#13;
US$50,000 for individuals would be made against Statement of Expenditure (SOE) for which appropriate&#13;
documents would be retained by the PCU. Disbursement for contracts above these limits would be made on&#13;
the basis of full documentation. The required supporting documentation will be retained by the PCU for at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement is made.&#13;
This documentation will be made available for review by the auditors and by visiting Bank staff upon request.&#13;
E. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.13   The PCU would maintain a set of consolidated records and accounts for each project component and&#13;
implementing agencies. All project accounts, including the special account and SOEs, would be audited&#13;
annually in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank". The Government will provide the Bank within six months of the end of each&#13;
fiscal year (December 31), an audit report of such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request,&#13;
including a separate opinion by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, on disbursernent against&#13;
SOEs. The cost of this audit will be eligible for financing under the Bank loan&#13;
F. Monitoring Performance and Reporting&#13;
3.14 Performance Monitorini The key monitoring indicators and benchmarks for each project&#13;
component/subcomponent have been defined and are included in Annexes 2-3. In particular, the&#13;
administration of justice component will be monitored in four ways: (i) changes in the volume of cases&#13;
disposed; (ii) improvements in the quality ofjudicial decisions; (iii) economic analysis of reforms in judicial&#13;
administration; and (iv) overall improvements in judicial services from the viewpoints of users and more&#13;
broadly, of the general public.&#13;
3.15  First changes in the volume of cases disposed will be measured by using two indicators: congestion&#13;
index and congestion ratio. These indicators have been adopted to monitor judicial performance in Costa&#13;
Rica and Chile, and show the level of congestion and the speed of reducing the congestion. (For example,&#13;
the congestion ratio is the percentage of the cases sentenced or disposed as a proportion of the number of&#13;
new filings in each court in a specific year.) In April 1996, the Judiciary conducted a statistical survey with&#13;
the support of the INEI (National Statistical Institute) and is currently developing baseline performance&#13;
indicators. Based on the experience in other Latin American countries, it is expected that productivity would&#13;
increase by 15% in the first year and by 35% in the third year, compared to the level of 1995.'3 Second,&#13;
imnprovements in the quality ofjudicial decision will be evaluated annually at national and regional forums&#13;
(plenarios) with judges, and further improvement plans will be discussed. With the improved case&#13;
administration and training of court personnel, judges would have more time to devote to judicial decision-&#13;
making. In addition, improved training ofjudges would enhance the quality of decisions based on sound legal&#13;
reasoning. Third, the economic impact of reforms in judicial administration will be analyzed annually, both in&#13;
terms of: (i) the costs of providing judicial services; and (ii) the income to be generated by the Judiciary's own&#13;
efforts. And sly, the overall improvements in judicial services will be assessed through: (i) opinion surveys&#13;
on litigants, lawyers, businessmen, and the general public; and (ii) research and monitoring of the reform&#13;
process by various groups in the civil society, supported under the Access Fund.&#13;

prepared by INVERTEC IGT, July 1996. For exampie, the Superior Court in Santiago (Chile) achieved productivity&#13;
increase by 30%Yo during 1995, due to the measues to systematically reduce pending cases and cate a position of&#13;
professional Administrative Coordinator to assist the President of the Superior Court in adminimv matters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
3.16  Reportin . The PCU will prepare semi-annual progress reports for all components of the project,&#13;
based on the inputs from the four implementing agencies. These will describe: (i) progress achieved during&#13;
the previous six months in the implementation and in the achievement of the objectives of the project based&#13;
on the performance indicators; (ii) an assessment of the problems and issues derived from the implementation&#13;
of the project; (iii) updated implementation and disbursement schedules for the following six months; and (iv)&#13;
status of compliance with the legal covenants contained in the Loan Agreement. The reports will provide&#13;
timely and updated information on project implementation, highlighting issues and problem areas,&#13;
recommending actions and commenting on progress in executing previous recommendations.&#13;
3.17  To facilitate project implementation and gain support from stakeholders, the PCU would organize a&#13;
project launch workshop with the participation of the Judiciary, CNM, AM, DP representatives, and judges&#13;
from the selected districts (Lima, Arequipa, Cusco, Lambayeque, Piura). Because the first court performance&#13;
improvement pilot involving new court procedures and organization, court automation and related training,&#13;
remodeling recently began in the Lambayeque district, the experience of the Lambayeque pilot would be&#13;
evaluated and disseminated before the pilot is expanded to the other selected districts of similar size.&#13;
Moreover, in the third year of the project life, a mid-term review of the five-year program will be conducted&#13;
in addition to regular monitoring and reporting. Prior to this review, the PCU will conduct a comprehensive&#13;
evaluation aimed at assessing the progress in achieving the objectives of the project, as defined by the set of&#13;
agreed indicators and the prospects for successful project completion.&#13;
IV. ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS&#13;
4.1   The proposed project aims to improve the enforceability of legal and contractual rights through&#13;
improved judicial administration and judicial decision-maldng, and increased access to alternative dispute&#13;
resolution mechanisms. As such, the project is not expected to adversely affect the environinent. In the&#13;
medium term, the project could have a positive impact on the environment as it reinforces the effectiveness of&#13;
legal regulation over social and economic activities. An effective legal framework is a key instrument for&#13;
deterring environmentally damaging activities or seeking remedies.&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1   The project is expected to improve the capacity of the judiciary to build and sustain its independent&#13;
role, to improve the enabling environment for private sector development, and to improve the access to and&#13;
the quality of justice for the citizenry. More specific benefits include increased courtroom productivity and&#13;
efficiency, thereby reducing the private and social costs of dispute resolution and improve equity in access to&#13;
justice. Benefits also include reductions in the time of delay in court actions, reduced case backlogs, and&#13;
improved quality of decision making by judges and justice of the peace.&#13;
5.2   First, the project would support measures to improve economic and political independence of the&#13;
Judiciary. Although budget allocation is partly a function of overall resource constraints, the Judiciary must&#13;
be able to seek and obtain the resources needed to meet its responsibilities, use those resources prudently, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
account for their use. It must be also able to raise separate resources (from user charges) to secure its&#13;
financial base. The low salary level of the judicial sector that hinders attracting capable personnel, poor&#13;
infiastructure etc.-these problems are partially caused by the inability of the Judiciary to manage and assign&#13;
resources efficiently and effectively. The project would strengthen financial management, implement new fee&#13;
structure, and provide merit-based bonus incentives for judges, administrative and court personnel.&#13;
Moreover, in supporting the CNM, the project is expected to assist in building a stronger, depoliticized, and&#13;
merit-based system of selection, appointment, advancement and removal of judges. Second, the project is&#13;
designed to strengthen the functioning of selected. fundamental pieces of the justice system; the Judiciary,&#13;
CNM, AM, and DP. To this end, discrete activities have been identified: e.g., modernization of court&#13;
management, judge training, transparent and impartial selection and promotion process for judges,&#13;
infiastructure improvement. With improved incentive structures, a reorganized, modem court system, and a&#13;
performance monitoring system put in place, the project would contribute to strengthening the functioning of&#13;
selected, key judicial institutions in an integrated manner. In particular, the strengthening of the CNM&#13;
(selection and evaluation ofjudges), AM (udicial training), and DP (defense of citizens' rights) is expected to&#13;
have spill-over effects in the entire judicial sector. Third, although the project will not involve criminal courts&#13;
or the TGC, the resources saved by the increased efficiency in the other areas may be devoted to these&#13;
aspects of the judicial system. Additionally, better civil courts would improve the overall image of the&#13;
Judiciary, thus increasing popular trust in the institutions. This is closely related to the second point above.&#13;
In this way, the project would bring about positive externalities to the entire justice system, including criminal&#13;
justice and TGC. Fourth, the project is designed to build the social capacity for demanding and monitoring&#13;
the progress in judicial reform and judicial performance by attempting'to broadly involve the civil society--&#13;
such as bar associations, NGOs, universities, the business community, and the other users--in the evaluation&#13;
of reform process and outcome (e.g., in the form of opinion surveys, user surveys, workshops). Such efforts&#13;
would result in greater awareness of the society in the rule of law and the role and importance of the justice&#13;
systemn, a better system of checks and balances as provided in the new Constitution and eventually contribute&#13;
to achieving a long-term goal ofjudicial independence, integrity and accountability in Peru. Fifth, and finally,&#13;
the project, by supporting several key improvements in the justice system, is expected to assist in preventing&#13;
and correcting corrupt practices, making for greater transparency and accountability in the conduct of public&#13;
affairs.&#13;
5.3    Economic Benefits. Because this is a primarily technical assistance project, it is not as easily&#13;
susceptible to cost-benefit analysis. Nevertheless, a simplified analysis was attempted to capture&#13;
quantitatively a dimension of benefits expected from the reform associated with the proposed project. 14The&#13;
evaluation of economic viability considered the Bank project as a part of the investment and technical&#13;
assistance required for comprehensive judicial modernization (about US$60 million for five years, e.g., by&#13;
including investments in the judicial districts other than those selected for the proposed project). A simple&#13;
model was developed that takes account of the projected demand forjudicial services (assuming a 3.5%&#13;
growth rate per year), court productivity (in processing and resolving cases), and increases in court&#13;
productivity expected under the reform scenario. Unit costs for typical courts were calculated, and then the&#13;
14 The analysis is based on a simple model to measure benefits associated with court productivity improvement Under the&#13;
"with" reform scenario, the future demand for judicial services would be satisfied and bacldogs would be eliminated through&#13;
a progressive increase in court productivity and the limited creation of tmnsitowy and/or permanent courts; under the&#13;
"without" reform scenario, these would be achieved primarily through the creation of the larger number of transitory and&#13;
permanent courts because court productivity will remain at the 1995 level. For more detailed analysis and assumption, see&#13;
Evaluacion Economica de la Reforma Judicial en la Republica de Peru, iNVERTEC IGT, July 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
costs required for satisfying the projected demand for judicial services and eliminating the accumulated&#13;
backlogs were estimated for both the "with" and "without" reform scenarios. The saving to be generated&#13;
under the "with" reform scenario is considered benefits to the proposed reform activities. The result of&#13;
economic analysis suggests significant direct benefits, US$96.5 million of a net present value of the&#13;
incremental benefits (using a 11 percent discount rate). This does not include indirect benefits, such as&#13;
possible increases in foreign investment and reactivation in domestic business transactions, greater&#13;
institutional autonomy of the Judiciary, potential reduction in corruption, and the other quantitative benefits&#13;
described in the above para. 5.2. The other potential benefit that is not captured in this analysis includes the&#13;
positive fiscal impact resulting from the Judiciary's improved income generating capacity, through the&#13;
implementation of the better judicial fee structures and new forms of resource mobilization, to be supported&#13;
under the proposed project. 15&#13;
B. Project Risks and Safefuards&#13;
5.4    Despite new opportunities and impetus provided by recent developments, the project, within a very&#13;
sensitive sector, faces challenges and potential risks. Major risks include: (i) medium-term sustainability of&#13;
the project; (ii) a lack of solid participatory approach and coordination among key entities and agencies&#13;
involved in the reformn; (iii) weak institutional capacity for the implementation of the project; (iv) resistance to&#13;
change from key groups, including judges, court personnel, businessmen and litigants, with vested interests in&#13;
the current system; and (v) political interference and potential instability in the project environment. The&#13;
project intends to deal with such risks as follows:&#13;
5.5 First, regarding the issue on medium-term sustainabilit, Bank preparation has been placing special&#13;
emphasis on the engagement of key players, who would be responsible for the implementation of a project, in&#13;
the reform process. Efforts are being made in identifying a core group of reform-minded judges to assume&#13;
leadership in the design of the pilot programs in the selected districts. The project also supports activity to&#13;
promote the participation of the civil society in monitoring progress in judicial reform to increase the chances&#13;
of sustainable change. Moreover, in regard to the project, the implementing agencies have agreed, as will be&#13;
reflected in the policy letter, to continue and strengthen a participatory approach in project implementation.&#13;
These aspects will be evaluated in the project's annual reviews (to which representatives of stakeholders will&#13;
be invited). Second, the issue of coordination is being addressed by the establishment, prior to negotiations,&#13;
of an appropriate coordination mechanism at both policy and operational levels. Furthermore, throughout&#13;
preparation, a number of joint meetings and workshops have been organized to discuss specific reform&#13;
proposals which have bearings on various actors. Third, to address the issue on weak institutional capacity,&#13;
the administration ofjustice component takes a phased, pilot approach, starting in the Lambayeque and Lima&#13;
districts, where there are indications of strong leadership commnitment and a sense of reform ownership&#13;
amnong judges with tenure. Before expanding the court performance improvement pilots to the other selected&#13;
districts, these experiences would be evaluated and the lessons gained would be disseminated and&#13;
incorporated into the subsequent pilots. Moreover, the Japanese PHRD grant has been provided to set up a&#13;
functioning PCU, which lializes various agencies involved in the project and ensures the consistency of&#13;
activities. Fourth, the issue of resistance to change is expected to be minimzed through the implementation&#13;
of a participatory approach, with project financing, to involve affected groups in each of the selected districts.&#13;
5 The preliminay study by GERPRO S.A. contracted by the Judiciary indicates a possibility of increasing the Judiciaxy's proper&#13;
income from 19 million soles (about $7 million) up to 46 million soles (about $17 million), in constant 1996 prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
5.6   Lasdy, the issue of political interference and potential instability in the project environment. This is a&#13;
highly sensitive and complex matter. An effective Judiciary requires that it function free from political&#13;
interference to ensure the impartiality and observance ofjudicial decisions. It is widely recognized that there&#13;
is no strong tradition of an independent Judiciary in Peru as other LDCs, although important-but limited-&#13;
developments in restoring some balance of power may be seen in the establishment and operation of the&#13;
CNM and the DP. In particular, it is reported that interference continues to exist in military control ofjudicial&#13;
processes and anti-terrorism legislation (outside the scope of the project). The project intends to help the&#13;
"depolitization" of the Judiciary in Peru at different levels. First, the project aims at supporting the CNM to&#13;
move towards a merit-based system of judicial recruitment and removals. To this end, a coordination&#13;
mechanism was established between the AM and the CNM, and the principle of transparency, openness, and&#13;
contestability was agreed on the AM's training program for aspiring judges and technical evaluation of&#13;
tenured judges, as spelled out in the policy letter. Second, to strengthen independence in decision-making,&#13;
the project would support training efforts of the AM to enhance the independent role of the judge and&#13;
reaffirm a "culture" of independence. Third, the project, mainly through the Access Fund, is expected to&#13;
facilitate the development of a constituency in support ofjudicial reform as a means to demand and pressure&#13;
for sustainable institutional changes. Fourth, other project interventions such as improvement in the&#13;
administration of the courts would indirectly strengthen independence by improving the standing of the&#13;
Judiciary in the community.&#13;
C. Participatory Arpnroach and Sustainability&#13;
5.7   For judicial reform, and any institutional reform in general, to be sustainable and viable over the long-&#13;
run, it requires consensus and a broad participation from the legal community as well as the civil society.&#13;
During preparation, a carefully-designed participatory approach has been taken to build an internal consensus&#13;
leading to reform. A series of workshops and meetings were organized and continued to be planned for: (i)&#13;
judges and key agencies involved in the project (seeking the cooperation and consensus on the project design,&#13;
and evaluating and sharing the lessons gained from the court performance improvement pilot in Chiclayo and&#13;
Lima); and (ii) more broadly the civil society, including bar associations, NGOs, the business community, and&#13;
other users of the system (aimed at information sharing, consultation, and evaluation on reform progress).&#13;
5.8   The sustainability of the project will depend in part on the continued commitment of the Judiciary&#13;
itself and the government to judicial reform Interest in this comprehensive reform program is shared between&#13;
the Executive and Judiciary. The Executive views judicial reform as an integral component of its plan of&#13;
government, supporting its economic reform objective as well as its aim to modernize state institutions.&#13;

5.    El Anexo I de esta carta contiene una matriz de lineamientos generales de reforma&#13;
a corto, mediano y largo plazo y areas y acciones de reforma que busca implementar los&#13;
objetivos mencionados.&#13;
B.    Proyecto de Inversi6n Banco Mundial (Proyecto BM)&#13;
6.    Dentro de la vision y estrategia definida para la reforma judicial, el Estado Peruano&#13;
ha solicitado el apoyo financiero y tecnico del Banco Mundial en relaci6n a un conjunto&#13;
integral de actividades e inversiones prioritarias tendientes a mejorar la calidad, eficiencia,&#13;
integridad, independencia y acceso del servicio de justicia con enfasis en las areas civil,&#13;
fcomercial y laboral. Dichas actividades e inversiones resultan de un dialogo extenso y&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
profundo entre las autoridades del Estado Peruano y el Banco Mundial, teniendo en cuenta&#13;
analisis y estudios sectoriales, consultas y opiniones a sectores interesados y afectados&#13;
incluyendo los magistrados, personal auxiliar, academicos, litigantes, organizaciones no&#13;
gubernamentales y usuarios en general.&#13;
La Corte Suprema de Justicia del Poder Judicial apoya esta asistencia del Banco Mundial.&#13;
El Anexo 2 a esta carta contiene un sumario de los objetivos y las actividades e inversiones&#13;
del Proyecto BM.&#13;
La calidad asi como la independencia, eficiencia y eficacia del servicio de justicia&#13;
se fortalecera con el apovo financiero y tecnico brindado al Consejo Nacional de la&#13;
Magistratura, la Academia de la Magistratura y la Oficina de Control de la Magistratura.&#13;
Primeramente, reconocemos la necesidad de un sistema de selecci6n y nombramiento,&#13;
evaluaci6n, ratificaci6n y promoci6n de magistrados que sea independiente, meritorio.&#13;
transparente y objetivo, evitando todo tipo de influencias politicas o de otra indole.&#13;
A tal efecto, la Constituci6n ha dispuesto que el Consejo Nacional de la Magistratura tenga&#13;
la responsabilidad de implementar tal sistema. El Consejo Nacional de la Magistratura&#13;
reconoce que es la primera vez en la historia del Peru que se opta por alejar de las&#13;
influencias y presiones politico partidarias de los procesos de selecci6n, nombramiento,&#13;
ratificaci6n y remoci6n .&#13;
El Consejo Nacional de la Magistratura se instala el lero. de marzo de 1995 despues de&#13;
promulgarse su Ley Organica - ley 26397- . Hasta la fecha ha cubierto las vacantes de&#13;
Fiscalias Supremas y de Vocalias y Fiscalias Superiores de todos los distritos judiciales del&#13;
pais, quedando un remanente de plazas por haberse declarado desiertas.&#13;
8.    El Consejo Nacional de la Magistratura con la experiencia obtenida en los&#13;
concursos ya celebrados, ha formulado autocriticas. Reconoce como consecuencia de esas&#13;
reflexiones, la necesidad de afinar criterios y perfeccionar las reglas y procedimientos de&#13;
selecci6n y nombramiento. A tal efecto emprenderi, con asistencia del proyecto BM, un&#13;
programa de desarrollo institucional que le permitira lograr excelencia y eficiencia tecnica&#13;
en el cumplimiento de su modelo constitucional.&#13;
La segunda funci6n del Consejo, la destituci6n de los magistrados (Jueces y Fiscales) se ha&#13;
cumplido simultaneamente a la de seleccion y nombramiento. Se ha dispuesto la apertura&#13;
de proceso a 48 magistrados en base a las solicitudes de destituci6n recibidas, 29 de ellos&#13;
con resoluci6n de destituci6n y estando en pleno procesamiento los 19 restantes.&#13;
El Consejo no ha iniciado el proceso de ratificaci6n, que es la tercera funci6n o atribucion&#13;
que le concede la Constituci6n. Las razones son claras:&#13;
(a) La situaci6n de provisionalidad y suplencias de los cargosjudiciales que alcanza&#13;
a mas del 80%.&#13;
No puede ratificarse al magistrado nombrado provisionalmente o suplente&#13;
k)N&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
(c) Debe definirse previamente el sentido de la norma constitucional relativa a la&#13;
frase "...cada siete afnos" (art. 154, inc. 2).&#13;
9.    Reconocemos la profunda necesidad que tienen los magistrados peruanos de una&#13;
formaci6n y capacitaci6n integral. A tal efecto, se establecio la Academia de la&#13;
Magistratura que se encuentra en pleno funcionamiento a partir de 1996. La AM esta&#13;
comprometida en una capacitaci6n integral del magistrado, no a una mera repetici6n de la&#13;
ensefianza universitaria, involucrando primariamente los aspectos de actitudes y&#13;
habilidades de los magistrados. Bajo el proyecto BM, la AM implementara programas&#13;
anuales de capacitaci6n de jueces civiles, laborales y mixtos, en areas y temas prioritarios&#13;
mayor impacto produzcan en la mejora de la calidad del servicio. La AM  se&#13;
/  compromete a implementar dichos programas anuales a traves de metodos costo-efectivos&#13;
(contrataci6n competitiva de servicios de terceros) que mejor aprovechen la capacidad&#13;
profesional existente en los distritos seleccionados.&#13;
10.   El Secretario Ejecutivo de la Comisi6n Ejecutiva del Poder Judicial deleg6 las&#13;
atribuciones que le transferia la Ley 26623 a una Comisi6n de Gobierno y Reorganizacion&#13;
para que conduzca la Academia de la Magistratura. Una funci6n de la Academia de la&#13;
Magistratura es la de capacitar a los aspiraintes a magistrados, con la finalidad de disponer&#13;
de un grupo humano tecnicamente calificado para ser posteriormente elegible por el CNM.&#13;
Para lograr este objetivo de una manera transparente y rigurosa desde el punto de vista&#13;
acaddmico. Ia Academia de la Magistratura va a realizar exAmenes de admisio6n para&#13;
seleccionar los abogados que deseen postular a los cursos de formaci6n de aspirantes. El&#13;
examen de admisi6n a los cursos de aspirantes sera calificado de manera an6nima y sus&#13;
f      resultados serin publicados. Una vez admitidos a la Academia de la Magistratura. los&#13;
aspirantes asistirin a un programa de entrenamiento consistente en diferentes m6dulos. Su&#13;
,I,         desempefio seri evaluado peri6dicamente durante el curso del programa de entreniamienito -&#13;
m6dulo a m6dulo por la Academia de la Magistratura. El sistema de evaluacion en todas&#13;
sus etapas serA an6nimo. Aquellos que resulten aprobados serin elegibles para postular a un&#13;
concurso para un nombramiento judicial. Dicho concurso seri efectuado por el Consejo&#13;
Nacional de la Magistratura, quien hara una  selecci6n transparente. independiente.&#13;
meritoria y objetiva.&#13;
11.   La Academia de la Magistratura tiene ademas la responsabilidad de hacer la&#13;
evaluaci6n de idoneidad tecnico - profesional, juridica, de conocimiento de los magistrados&#13;
en actual ejercicio. Esta evaluaci6n tiene por finalidad contribuir a determinar las&#13;
necesidades de capacitaci6n. Los magistrados provisionales o suplentes que desaprueben la&#13;
evaluaci6n podran ser separados por la Comisi6n Ejecutiva del Poder Judicial. En cambio.&#13;
los magistrados titulares que desaprueben la primera prueba seguiran un curso academico&#13;
complementario financiado por el Estado y estaian obligados a tomar una segunda prueba&#13;
escrita por la Academia. Aquellos magistrados que resulten desaprobados en la segunda&#13;
prueba podrin ser separados por la Comisi6n Ejecutiva del Poder Judicial. Toda prueba de&#13;
evaluaci6n tendri caricter an6nimo y su calificaci6n y revisi6n s6lo podrx ser efectuada&#13;
por la Academia de la Magistratura de acuerdo a criterios t6cnicos y transparentes. Las&#13;
ersonas evaluadas en la segunda prueba podrin solicitar revisi6n de los resultados de la&#13;
isma a la Academia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
12.   Reconocemos que el magistrado, ademas de ser independiente y competente, debe&#13;
guardar una conducta etica intachable. Para ello consideramos que es esencial realizar&#13;
acciones concretas que esten orientadas a reducir las posibilidades de corrupci6n. En&#13;
atencion a ello, el Poder Judicial ha reorganizado los juzgados bajo un nuevo modelo lo&#13;
cual permite un mejor control del despacho judicial; se ha racionalizado y reubicado al&#13;
personal auxiliar; y, ha apoyado la tarea de la OCMA con el fin de estimular y apoyar a los&#13;
jueces integros y sancionar a aquellos que incurran en conductas contrarias a la etica.&#13;
Concretamente en este uiltimo affo se ha descentralizado el control a las diversas Cortes&#13;
Superiores en las que viene funcionando comisiones distritales de la OCMA.&#13;
13.   Para mejorar la eficiencia del servicio de justicia, el Proyecto BM  apoya el&#13;
fortalecimiento y desconcentraci6n de la gesti6n organica - administrativa del Poder&#13;
Judicial. En este sentido se llevaran a cabo acciones dirigidas a reforzar la capacidad&#13;
gerencial y modemizar la gesti6n judicial. A nivel de los juzgados. el Proyecto BM apoya&#13;
la implantaci6n, de un nuevo modelo de organizaci6n funcional comenzando en los&#13;
distritos judiciales de Lima y Lambayeque. Con la implantaci6n de este modelo se espera&#13;
resolver el problema de la morosidad judicial, mejorando la productividad judicial; a su vez&#13;
este modelo generaui procesos judiciales mas transparentes. creando con ello mayores&#13;
condiciones para el control de la corrupci6n. Por otro lado, el Proyecto BM contribuirA en&#13;
ia sistematizaci6n, uniformizaci6n v mejora de la calidad de la jurisprudencia.&#13;
especialmente en materia civil y laboral. La Comisi6n Ejecutiva ha iniciado, y continuara.&#13;
un plan de mejora de los incentivos para los magistrados incluvendo un incremento en los&#13;
ingresos, a traves de los bonos jurisdiccionales.&#13;
14.   En relaci6n al acceso a la justicia, el Proyecto BM  fortalecera instituciones&#13;
existentes asi como instituciones nuevas que facilitan la resoluci6n de conflictos&#13;
particularmente de los grupos mas marginados. Primeramente. se apoyari a los jueces de&#13;
paz a traves de una capacitaci6n focalizada: asistencia tecnica para implementar el marco&#13;
regulatorio de la justicia de paz; y, estudios y encuestas sobre el desempeibo de los jueces&#13;
de paz. En segundo lugar, se apoyari a la Defensoria del Pueblo a traves de asistencia&#13;
tecnica para el fortalecimiento institucional, asi como asistencia especializada para el&#13;
medio ambiente y comunidades nativas. Asimismo contribuiri con las campanias de&#13;
difusi6n a nivel nacional sobre las funciones de la Defensoria y al equipamiento&#13;
informatico.&#13;
Por ultimo, el Proyecto incluye un fondo destinado a financiar iniciativas del sector privado&#13;
tendientes a promover mecanismos altemativos de resoluci6n de conflictos y desarrollar la&#13;
capacidad de la sociedad civil para demandar y monitorear el desempeno judicial.&#13;
C.   Coordinaci6n.&#13;
&lt;  15.   El proyecto BM  tiene cuatro entes ejecutores: Poder Judicial, a traves de la&#13;
omisi6n Ejecutiva, la Academia de la Magistratura, el Consejo Nacional de la&#13;
tMagistratura y la Defensoria del Pueblo. Sin perjuicio de su propia autonomia y&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
responsabilidad de ejecuci6n, dichos entes mencionados convinieron en establecer una&#13;
unidad coordinadora con el personal y funciones descritos en el manual operativo del&#13;
Proyecto BM. Asimismo, cada uno de los entes ejecutores ha nombrado un representante a&#13;
los fines del Proyecto BM y a efectos de sostener reuniones mensuales para intercambiar&#13;
opiniones sobre la marcha del Proyecto BM.&#13;
D.   Metodologia Participativa.&#13;
16.   Reconocemos que el exito y sostenibilidad de la reforma y el Proyecto BM&#13;
dependen, no solamente del apoyo financiero y politico, sino del grado de participaci6n por&#13;
parte de los magistrados particularmente y de la sociedad civil en general. Como&#13;
consecuencia de ello, cada ente ejecutor ha involucrado a jueces y otras partes interesadas&#13;
en el proceso de formulaci6n y diseflo de las actividades del Proyecto BM. Reconocemos&#13;
ademas que dicha metodologia participativa debe perfeccionarse y profundizarse mucho&#13;
mas. A tal efecto cada ente ejecutor se compromete a implementar sus actividades propias&#13;
del Proyecto BM a traves de una metodologia de participaci6n activa.&#13;

Judicial Performance Indicators&#13;
The project is expected to produce more efficient and effective results and improve the quality of services,&#13;
particularly in the first instance courts. As described in paras. 3.14-3.15 of the main text, the judicial&#13;
perfornance will be monitored through performance indicators to assess progress in judicial productivity and&#13;
decongestion quality ofjudicial decisions, improvements in overall administration of the system,&#13;
improvements in restoring judicial tenure and increased access to justice.&#13;

&lt;Supplementary Notes on Court Performance Indicators&gt;&#13;
Indicators for Congestion&#13;
(1) Congestion ratio (TC) is defined as the number of cases disposed (T) as a proportion of the number of&#13;
cases filed (I) during a certain period of time. In the project, the disposition per year of the courts in the&#13;
selected districts will be calculated as a percentage of the number of filing per year. This ratio will allow&#13;
monitoring of whether judges are able to handle the volume of work or backlogs are developing.&#13;
TC=T/I&#13;
Experience suggests that if the congestion ratio is 1 or above, the volume of cases disposed in a particular&#13;
courtroom is either equal or even exceed the number of filings. If the congestion ratio is less than 1, the&#13;
caseload is higher than the capacity of a courtroom (or judges) for handling the volume of work. As Table&#13;
shows, the volume of case disposed of as a proportion of filed cases is lower than one in most of the districts&#13;
in Peru.&#13;
(2) Congestion index (IC) is defined as the number of pending cases at the end of a particular year (CT-T) as&#13;
a proportion of the number of cases brought to a courtroom in this year plus unresolved cases (or "stock")&#13;
from the previous year (CT).&#13;
IC = (CT-T) / CT&#13;
The congestion index below 20% implies that a particular courtroom is roughly capable of satisfying the&#13;
caseload imposed by the system. On the other hand, if the congestion index is above 20%, it suggests that&#13;
the cumulative caseload is too heavy for a courtroom to handle the work.&#13;
(3) Productivity index: Productivity can be measured as the volume of different types of cases disposed per&#13;
courtroom (or one judge) or per sala (3 superior judges) in a certain period of time. Although this is an&#13;
indicator for production (not productivity) in a strict sense, it roughly explains the volume of production per&#13;
unit ofjudges. Therefore, by comparing the volume of cases in a year to that in the previous year, it is&#13;
possible to measure annual productivity increase of a particular courtroom.&#13;
In order to calculate the above indicators, the Statistics Office of the Judiciary will annually prepare the&#13;
following formats for civil and labor courts as well as juzgados de paz letrados in the selected districts: Lima&#13;
(including Callao and Cono Norte), Arequipa, Cuzco, Piura, and Lambayeque. Similar information will be&#13;
prepared for superior courts in the selected districts and the Supreme Court.&#13;
(4) Efficiency index:&#13;
(a)   Number of sentences and judgments (sentencias) and interlocutory appeal decisions (autos&#13;
interlocutorios) divided by the number of court employees.&#13;
(b)   Number of final sentences and judgments divided by the number of court employees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65&#13;
(5) Processing time for civil and special cases:&#13;
(a)     For cases which have not concluded, average time between case filing (ingreso del&#13;
expediente) and the final judgment divided by the maximum time established by law.&#13;
(b)     For cases which have not concluded, average time between case filing and the current date (at&#13;
which the case is reviewed by the investigator), divided by the maximum time established by&#13;
law for case filing to judgment.&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Oreanization of the Judiciary&#13;
1. In accordance with the Constitution and its Organic Law, the Peruvian Judiciary is organized with the&#13;
following judicial institutions: the Supreme Court, Superior Courts or Courts of Appeal, Trial Courts, and&#13;
Justices of the Peace. Within the court system, there has been an increasing effort to decentralize the courts&#13;
and to separate administrative from judicial matters. The court system is distributed loosely according to the&#13;
defined political jurisdictions of the country. There are 24 departments (political jurisdictions) and 24 judicial&#13;
districts, roughly correspondent, and two additional districts in preparation (Cono Sur and Chosica). The&#13;
Supreme Court serves the whole nation, while there is a Superior Court in each judicial district. Under the&#13;
Superior Courts there are several first instance courts and a very small number of "lettered" Justices of the&#13;
Peace. As of April 1996, there are 1,253 magistrates throughout the country.&#13;
2. Much of the ordinary justice in Peru occurs at the level of Justices of the Peace (JPs), who have&#13;
jurisdictional responsibility of first instance for some criminal and civil matters. JPs do not specialize&#13;
according to case matter, but are divided into two orders: those who have obtained a legal education&#13;
("lettered", or Juecez de Paz Letrados) and those whose reputation in the community in which they live have&#13;
won them the responsibility to adjudicate in matters relevant to the daily lives of citizens (Juecez de Paz, or&#13;
lay judges). "Lettered" JPs have jurisdictional competence and autonomy of decision over both civil and&#13;
some crimninal, and are the equivalent to judges of first instance in areas where the reach of the ordinary court&#13;
system for the administration of justice is absent. In this sense, it is a mechanism to relieve the case load&#13;
burden of the court and to provide access to the vast majority of citizens. In contrast, the Juecez de Paz (lay&#13;
judges) are not part of the judicial career and are loosely--if at all--supported by the formal justice system.&#13;
The development and expansion of the Juecez de Paz (lay judge) system is largely the result of the continuous&#13;
import of foreign legislation by the Peruvian legal system, its lack of roots in any local development, and the&#13;
limited access to the formal legal system. There are currently around 4,300 Juecez de Paz (vs. 1,253 forrnal&#13;
judges). In this system, rooted in local traditions, the judges are elected by popular votes within their&#13;
constituencies and apply customary law.&#13;
3. Courts of First Instance (Juzgados) are organized jurisdictionally in districts that correspond to the&#13;
Superior Courts. In districts with large populations, there are specialized jurisdiction tribunals (Civil,&#13;
Criminal, Labor, Agrarian, and Children). Otherwise, there is a single mixed-jurisdiction tribunal, or a mixed&#13;
tribunal working together with specialized courts, usually in civil and criminal matters. All districts, except&#13;
Lima and Callao, which are physically proximate to each other, have at least one mixed First Instance Courts.&#13;
Overall, there are 134 Mixed Courts, and 490 specialized First Instance Courts.&#13;
4. The Superior Courts have both appellate and original jurisdiction. With the new Organic Law, Superior&#13;
Courts in most cases are the court of final appeal. There is at least one Superior Court in the capital of each&#13;
judicial district. It is the highest judicial authority in each district. Decentralized Superior Courts can be&#13;
created by the Supreme Court out of the capital of the district (as has happened in the cases of Cono Norte&#13;
Superior Court in Lima, the Tarapoto Court in San Martin, or the Chimbote Court in Ancash). Overall, there&#13;
are 24 Superior Court districts and 99 chambers. There are up to five separate specialized chambers,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
68&#13;
composed of three or four magistrates each: Civil, Criminal, Labor, Family law, and Mixed jurisdictions. As&#13;
in the case of First Instance Courts, Mixed Jurisdiction Courts replace the specialized ones.&#13;
5. The Supreme Court, located in Lima, has three separate chambers of five judges each, and a total of&#13;
eighteen judges. (The remaining three judges serve in the Executive Council, the Office of the Magistracy&#13;
Control, and the Presidency of the Court.) The three specialized chambers in the Court include: Civil (Family&#13;
Law, Property, Contracts, Torts, and Commercial Controversies), Criminal, and Constitutional and Social&#13;
Law. Constitutional reforns have attempted to limit the types and numbers of cases heard by the Supreme&#13;
Court to those of cassation16 and "exceptional cases" involving matters of law and the civil responsibilities of&#13;
judges. In practice, prior to recent reforms, the Supreme Court had become simply one more instance of&#13;
appeal, and virtally all cases could find their way to this "third instance." The result has been extreme&#13;
overload at this level.&#13;

Annex 5&#13;
La Academia de la MaEistratura del Peru -AM&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The AM was established pursuant to article 151 of the Peruvian Constitution as one element of the&#13;
Judiciary. Its role is to undertake the education and training of judges and prosecutors and candidates for&#13;
judgeships and prosecutorships at all levels excluding the jueces de paz. In fact, the Constitution provides&#13;
that the approval of the respective AM courses is a prerequisite for judicial appointment.&#13;
2.    The specific mandate, goals and organizational structure of AM are regulated in Law 26335 of July&#13;
20, 1994 and in its by-laws approved through Resolution No. 0 1-94iAMAG-CD of December 26, 1994.&#13;
The AM is part of the Judiciary but is afforded autonomy in the academic, financial and administrative sense.&#13;
By law 26623 of June 18, 1996, the AM was included in the judicial reorganization process. On a transitory&#13;
basis, the Board has been suspended, and the Executive Secretary of the CE has assumed its functions.&#13;
Through Administrative Resolution No. 241-96-SE-TP-CME-PJ of June 26, 1996 the Executive Secretary&#13;
has delegated its functions in a committee ofjurists headed by the Director General of the AM. On July 11,&#13;
1996 the members of the committee were appointed.&#13;
3.    The AM's existence can be traced to specific local concerns as well as to international trends in&#13;
judicial professional development. Following 1992 it became critical to provide education and training for a&#13;
largely renewed and inexperienced judiciary. In addition, judicial sector reports in Peru indicated that the&#13;
judiciary was affected by inefficiency, incompetence and corruption. The country's aspirations for economic&#13;
and social development of course depend on the reliability of the legal system and specifically the quality of&#13;
judicial action. Both international and domestic commercial enterprises require a predictable and reliable&#13;
judicial system for the enforcement and regulation of the affairs. Around the world legal systems at all stages&#13;
of development have concluded that the continued professionalization of the judiciary is fundamental to&#13;
enhancing both social and economic values. Judging, like all other human endeavor, requires training,&#13;
education, monitoring and constant attention to improvement.&#13;
AM's Fundamental Principles&#13;
4.    The AM seeks to be a primary contributor to development and improvement of the public service of&#13;
administration of justice in Peru. It has quite properly declared itself to be committed to:&#13;
*  the sanctity of human life and individual rights&#13;
*  peace, the right to life and social justice as core societal values&#13;
*  the fundamentality of the rule of law and the institutions necessary for its maintenance&#13;
*  the independence of the judiciary&#13;
&#149;  the continuing education and training of the judiciary&#13;
*  the recognition that honor, foresight, integrity and honesty are indispensable attributes of competent&#13;
judges&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71&#13;
These central principles guide all AM activities that seek to create a judiciary capable of contributing&#13;
to a just and prosperous society.&#13;
AM's Central Goals&#13;
5.    In order to adequately play its part in the ongoing development of the country through justice under&#13;
law, the AM has therefore committed itself to a long term program of research, development and educational&#13;
activities. This program aims to provide the Peruvian judiciary with the resources and environment necessary&#13;
to caffy out its societal role efficiently and effectively. The AM's research and development, and the&#13;
programs and other activities arising from them, therefore aim to:&#13;
* train and educate those seeking appointments ofjudges and prosecutors&#13;
* train and educate those considering, seeking or eligible for promotion&#13;
* enhance the quality of individual judges and prosecutors through continuing education programs&#13;
* train and educate auxiliary court personnel&#13;
AM's Role in Concert with Others&#13;
6.    The professionalization of the judiciary is in large part dependent on the conditions under which its&#13;
members operate. The AM can assist the Judiciary authorities in identifying barriers to actual on-the-job&#13;
success, but it cannot itself remedy those that may be associated with working conditions beyond the AM's&#13;
control. Similarly, the AM can play a central role in helping to establish a positive judicial culture through the&#13;
enhancement ofjudicial attitudes and ethics. Again, the physical, social and professional environment must&#13;
reinforce these values. Perhaps the best way that the AM can contribute in the long term, beyond research&#13;
and development activities aimed at education and training, is through the creation of a flexible, adaptive and&#13;
supportive resource center for judges, no mater their location.&#13;
Operating Principles&#13;
7.    The AM is committed to a system of education and training that is decentralized, based on sound&#13;
adult education principles and practices, aimed at the improvement of skills and attitudes as well as&#13;
knowledge, and quality oriented. It is also determined to base its activities on original and locally validated&#13;
action research into judicial work.&#13;
8.    To date the AM has wisely focused its efforts on major research into the training needs ofjudges, the&#13;
planning process and the delivery of an initial group of courses. Through these activities the AM has been&#13;
able to design a plan of action aimed at systematically improving judicial quality in the country.&#13;
AM activities&#13;
9.    The AM's program is jointly sponsored by several organizations in addition to the Peruvian&#13;
government. The AM component will focus on civil and labor judges only in the area ofthe Lima judicial&#13;
district and four other of the country's twenty-four judicial districts. While the rest of this annex will for the&#13;
most part be concerned with the AM component it must be underscored that this part cannot succeed unless&#13;
the overall organization and operation of the AM, and balance of its activities, mesh comfortably with it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72&#13;
AM Component of Project Activities&#13;
10.   The AM component will be implemented over four years and half beginning in 1997 and ending in&#13;
2001. There a.re five main areas of activity planned, namely:&#13;
* Training and Education&#13;
. Research&#13;
. Publications&#13;
* Study Tours&#13;
* Expert Support (Apoyo Institucional)&#13;
Each ofthe project activities is described briefly below.&#13;
Training and Education&#13;
11.   The AM component, reflecting AM's overall program, is not intended either to replace or repeat&#13;
university legal education, which is oriented to general education and the preparation of lawyers rather that to&#13;
judicial training. Rather, the AM's training and education courses will aim to educate creative and reflective&#13;
judges capable of carrying out the unique duties of the judiciary, including legal analysis, decision-making and&#13;
dispute resolution. The AM will seek to ensure that judges make their decisions in the context of a profound&#13;
understanding of the impact on and means of the exercise of the judicial role in the support of economic and&#13;
social development.&#13;
Specific Objectives of the Training Program&#13;
12.   The AM recognizes that the conduct of the judicial role is complex and difficult. The exercise of&#13;
judgment in context requires as understanding of diverse knowledge bases and the ability to exercise the&#13;
judge's role with skill. In particular, the AM has set the following learning outcomes for its participants:&#13;
* knowledge and skill to conduct and improve their role&#13;
*  theoretical and practical education and training to enable judges to analyze and interpret the law in the&#13;
context of the specific facts of the case and arrive at a creative and reasoned decision&#13;
* preparation in disciplines connected to the law including, for example, economics, sociology,&#13;
criminology, information technology, business affairs so as to enable participants to appreciate and&#13;
take account of the economic and social demands and consequences of decision making&#13;
* training in the theory and practice of efficient and effective court and caseflow management and&#13;
communications skills to improve quality and speed of case handling, avoid delay and improve users'&#13;
perceptions of the judicial system&#13;
* preparation to influence judicial attitudes so as to promote positive reform, professional development,&#13;
and improved public relations&#13;
. education that will support the development of an independent and impartial judiciary concerned with&#13;
the achievement ofjustice, the maintenance of the constitution and the Rule of Law&#13;
* education and training that will produce moral and ethical judges prepared to join in the fight against&#13;
corruption&#13;
Methodology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73&#13;
13.   In order to achieve its training objectives the AM plans to design and develop its programs and&#13;
courses with the direct involvement of its participants to ensure that they are actively engaged in their own&#13;
learning process. Lectures and a focus on the delivery of information will be mriniized, pernitting&#13;
participants to acquire knowledge, skills, attitudes and operational strategies that will enable them to carry&#13;
out their role professionally.&#13;
14.   The following are the main criteria by which courses will be designed and developed:&#13;
participants will be provided carefully prepared written materials providing up to date summaries of&#13;
the case law, statute law and commentaries&#13;
learning and teaching will take place in small groups to permit active debate, analysis and problem&#13;
solving&#13;
* small group activities will usually be followed by plenary sessions in which group solutions will be&#13;
presented and tested in the presents of experts who will offer their views.&#13;
* expert opinions will be offered so as to promote debate, critical reflection, and a variety of feasible&#13;
solutions that may be questioned and debated by the participants&#13;
*  skills training will involve presentation of information, demonstration of adequate performance,&#13;
opportunities for participants to practice followed by constructive feedback&#13;
*  the study and fornation of professional attitudes will take place in the context of reflective and active&#13;
discussion.&#13;
Delivery System&#13;
15.   The programn will be delivered through carefully selected teacher experts who share a concern for&#13;
quality instruction and learning. There will be regular training courses to "train the trainers" and ensure&#13;
highest possible quality throughout the program's offerings. Most programs will be outsources to competent&#13;
providers approved by the AM. These contractors will be required to maintain preset standards and their&#13;
performance will be monitored throughout the period of their participation. As a result the main burden of&#13;
program delivery will be shifted to private contractors while the AM will be able to concentrate on program&#13;
management and quality control. Through this mechanism the AM will be able to deliver more courses and&#13;
produce additional publications than would be the case if it were directly responsible for all production.&#13;
Tendering and Course Requirements&#13;
16.   Courses will be prepared following a rigorous tendering process. A standard form tender document&#13;
will be provided to proposers, specifying the form of any proposal and its minimum contents. The final work&#13;
product of the successful party will include:&#13;
*  the resumes of all persons who may teach on the course (two or more instructors are planed for each&#13;
course to facilitate small group teaching)&#13;
*  the specific instructional objectives to be achieved in the course&#13;
*  the relationship between those objectives and the course objectives contained in the tender document&#13;
* the connection between the course objectives and the needs specified in the AM's needs assessment as&#13;
varied from time to time&#13;
*  the course syllabus including detailed outlines of substantive, procedural and other knowledge to be&#13;
covered&#13;
*  a statement of the skills areas to be covered&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74&#13;
*  a description of the course materials to be prepared&#13;
*  an outline of the audio-visual supports and aids that will be prepared&#13;
*  a statement of equipment, other resource and facility requirements&#13;
*  any other special requirements&#13;
*  a detailed lesson plan with teacher's notes, activity descriptions and leaming points&#13;
*  a statement indicating how participant learning will be assessed&#13;
*  an undertaking to use the AM's standard course evaluation instrument&#13;
Course Offerings&#13;
17.   Courses will be offered in the capital and four other districts according to a prescribed schedule.&#13;
Examples of areas in respect of which courses will be offered include:&#13;
Caseflow and Court Management&#13;
Judicial Reasoning, Decision Making and the Writing Judgments&#13;
Total Quality&#13;
* Judicial Ethics&#13;
e Judicial Administration and Information technology&#13;
* Civil Procedure&#13;
* Commercial Law&#13;
Constitutional Law&#13;
*  Property Law&#13;
*  Employment and Social Security Law&#13;
18.   Courses will blend substantive, procedural, skills, ethics and social impact objectives through teaching&#13;
in realistic contexts.&#13;
19.   In the first year, the AM component will sponsor two three-day courses in areas derived from the&#13;
needs assessment Qikely in the field of property and commercial law). The courses will be offered to all first&#13;
instance judges and appellate judges in the Lima judicial district. As result, there will be approximately&#13;
twelve offerings of each course, once to each judge in groups of about twenty-five. In the four other districts&#13;
of the Bank project the sarne courses will be offered six times to groups of about twenty-five judges. In short,&#13;
there will be thirty course offerings each year.&#13;
20.   By concentrating on needs assessment derived subjects the impact assessment (see Research below)&#13;
of the AM's activities will be reasonably traceable.&#13;
21.   Overall the AM plans to run about 100 courses in the first year, of which thirty will be conducted&#13;
under the Bank financed project and about seventy with the support of the sponsorship of the Peruvian&#13;
government and other funding agencies.&#13;
Course Monitoring and Evaluafion&#13;
22.   All courses will be evaluated by participants after each offering. As well, ongoing research activities&#13;
(referred to below) will be undertaken to study the impact of the training program on the operations of the&#13;
courts and the conduct ofjudges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75&#13;
Research&#13;
23.   The AM has already demonstrated its serious commitment to action research that provides a basis for&#13;
the preparation of education and training programs aimed at the real and perceived needs ofjudges and&#13;
prosecutors with the Japanese grant proceeds, it carried out an initial needs assessment of civil judges in the&#13;
judicial district of Lima (see Appendix). Such initial needs assessment research provides a solid base for its&#13;
programming activities and for the preparation of a publications plan. However, its needs assessment work&#13;
will not be fully complete until a carefully conducted job analysis is carried out. In addition, as the&#13;
circumstances change the AM must be prepared to update its work.&#13;
24.   The AM will also cany out research to determine whether its programming and publications are&#13;
having the desired effect through follow-up studies done both at the time of program offering and over time&#13;
to attempt to measure the impact of education and training on job performance.&#13;
25.   In a very real sense the research and evaluation activities planned will provide the expanded basis for&#13;
determining the success or failure of the AM's programming and will provide crucial data to support&#13;
improvement of its activities.&#13;
26.   Two major research activities are planned during the period of the Bank assisted project. the first is a&#13;
longitudinal study of the impact of the work of the AM and the second is the job analysis to support the&#13;
second part of the training needs assessment.&#13;
The Impact of the AM's Activities&#13;
27.   This research project will be designed with the assistance of social science research experts both local&#13;
and foreign. Funds for international experts have been provided in the expert support section (below). The&#13;
balance of required funds are specified in the research sub-subcomponent of the budget.&#13;
28.   Such longitudinal research aimed at measuring them impact of education and training activities is&#13;
complex. However, its importance cannot be underrated. Too often educational projects have no data or&#13;
analysis upon which to predicate future action.&#13;
Learning Needs Assessment - Job Analysis&#13;
29.   The conduct of a job analysis is one of the few ways to obtain an accurate picture and description of&#13;
professional work. Where such analyses do take place they provide a rich basis for providing future&#13;
education and training activities. Through a job analysis researchers identify the main tasks, knowledge and&#13;
skills required of particular professionals in action. By studying frequency, difficulty (in both performance&#13;
and learning), importance to accomplishment and other issues, researchers are able to identify the&#13;
components of professional knowledge and practice requiring specific attention through training and support&#13;
activities. As a result programming can systematically address the requirements of competent professional&#13;
practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76&#13;
30.   Such fundamentally important research is relatively uncommon among education providers. It is&#13;
viewed as a foundation and necessity for the adequate operation of a professionally sound education and&#13;
training institution.&#13;
Research Pklning&#13;
31.   The AM will prepare a detailed research plan for each project specifying objectives, methodology,&#13;
personnel requirements, schedule and budget. The Bank will approve each project prior to its inception.&#13;
Publications&#13;
32.   The AM will develop four major types of publications, all of which will provide free standing&#13;
resources to support competent, quality professional practice on the job or through distance learning. First&#13;
each course offered (see topics listed above under Course Offerings) by or through the AM will be&#13;
supported by descriptive and analytical written materials and some specially crafted instructional materials.&#13;
The non-instructional materials will also be available for use by practitioners who have not attended the&#13;
courses. This has already taken place with the pilot model courses offered by the AM in October and&#13;
November with Japanese Grant proceeds. Secondly, the AM will prepare practice manuals and other free-&#13;
standing publications. Thirdly, the AM will report through publication on its research activities. Finally there&#13;
will be newsletters, magazines and professional journals dedicated to the judiciary.&#13;
33.   The number of publications each year will match the individual courses offered and the research&#13;
completed. From time to time the AM will publish the other educational and practice supports mentioned&#13;
above for its participants. These latter materials will likely include:&#13;
*  manuals in the main areas of civil and labor law practice&#13;
-  a conciliation and dispute resolution handbook&#13;
-  a guide to decision-making and judgment writing&#13;
-  a handbook on ethical judicial practice&#13;
*  a guide to litigation and caseflow management&#13;
*  a guide to professional self-development&#13;
34.   No clear proposal has been devised for the publication of newsletters, magazines or professional&#13;
journals. However, as plans progress it will become more apparent how best to serve the information and&#13;
learning ofjudges through publications.&#13;
Study Visits&#13;
35.   Judicial professional development programs and activities are now proliferating throughout the&#13;
world. It is practically impossible to keep abreast of learning in the field without a program of regular&#13;
exchanges and visits. The AM is committed to developing and maintaining its operations at the highest&#13;
possible level and had already begun to establish working relationships with similar projects in other&#13;
countries.&#13;
The main objectives include:&#13;
* the establishment and strengthening of relationships with foreign judicial education authorities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77&#13;
* the gathering and exchange of information and experience; and&#13;
* the acquisition of new approaches to judicial professional development for application in Peru.&#13;
36.   In light of circumstances in the countries mentioned, and given needs pertinent in Peru, the AM senior&#13;
staff will undertake about seven visits (one or two each year) to some of the following organizations for the&#13;
purposes outlined following:&#13;
*  Canada - comparative legal systems and the administration ofjustice&#13;
*  Chile - exchange and study of the Chilean Judicial Academy for technical advice on operations&#13;
*  Colombia - Judicial methods in civil law&#13;
*  Costa Rica - links with the Judicial School to support training activities in the administration of justice&#13;
*  France - learning and teaching methods&#13;
*  Portugal - methods of program evaluation&#13;
*  Spain - training of candidate judges&#13;
*  USA - experience at both state and federal court levels through federal and state court education&#13;
authorities&#13;
*  Uruguay - information and experience exchange&#13;
37.   Each visit will be undertaken by two members of staff and is expected to last about two weeks on&#13;
average. This will provide sufficient time to observe and participate in the work of the foreign organization&#13;
so as to gain maximum possible benefit. On some occasions more than one site may be visited during a two&#13;
week trip.&#13;
Expert Advice&#13;
38.   The AM will of course require the periodic assistance of international consultants to stabilize and&#13;
improve its activities. It plans five annual consultations over the years of the project.&#13;
The main objectives of the consultations include:&#13;
* Curriculum and course development&#13;
* Research on the work and training ofjudges&#13;
* Technical advice in developing fields,&#13;
e.g., problem solving, decision making, judgment writing, law and economics, dispute resolution,&#13;
judicial resolution, judicial ethics, civil law and civil procedure, substantive civil and labor law.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
39.   The AM has been in actual operation since early 1996. It has steadily developed its research and&#13;
operating plan through systematic work to ensure that it will meet the real needs of the Peruvian state and&#13;
people.&#13;
40.   However, it is unlikely that the AM component's real effects will be known until it has had the&#13;
opportunity to influence the behavior of a critical mass ofjudicial officers across a wide band of their&#13;
activities. Expertise in judicial performance cannot be transferred or created overnight. The process of&#13;
producing creative, adaptive and reflective practitioners capable of self-development can be expected to take&#13;
longer than the project life. On the other hand, there is little doubt that much progress can be made though&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78&#13;
the multi-pronged efforts of training, research, publication and consultation, as has been planned by the AM&#13;
overall, and within the Bank financed project.&#13;
&lt;Supplementary Note&gt;&#13;
Leaming Needs Assessment&#13;
1.    AM carried out, with external experts, a training needs assessment of civil judges in the judical&#13;
district of Lima. The assessment comprised three stages: (i) design and carrying out of a survey; (ii)&#13;
organization of two focus groups ofjudges; and (iii) a workshop with litigants and other experts, national and&#13;
foreign.&#13;
2.    The survey, consisted of 45 multiple choice question and was applied to 58 judges representing 92 %&#13;
of the civil judges in Lima judicial district.&#13;
3.    Characteristics of group under the survey.&#13;
(a) Gender: 57% male, and 41% female&#13;
(b) Age:  57% under 40 years&#13;
36% 40 to 60 years&#13;
7% over 60 years&#13;
(c) Legal education:&#13;
36% - Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos&#13;
24% - Universidad Nacional Federico Villaroel&#13;
24% - Universidad San Martin de Porres&#13;
12% - Pontificial Universidad Catolica del Perui&#13;
4.    Problems in the Judiciary: Main problems identified are the excessive workload and deficient&#13;
performance of support personnel (84%). Other priority problems were the inadequate infiastucture (74%)&#13;
and lack of adequate resources (7 1 %). It showed a tendency to invoke external factors to explain the poor&#13;
performance of the Judiciary.&#13;
5.    Training needs: Training areas identified fall within three categories: (i) judicial skills; (ii) legal&#13;
knowledge; and (iii) judicial culture. As far asjudicial skills, most significant areas included evaluation of&#13;
evidence, judicial reasoning, legal writing, management, leadership and ethics. In regard to legal knowledge,&#13;
most significant areas included contractual and extracontractual liability and measurement of damages, nullity&#13;
and inefficacy of transactions, constitutional resources, administrative law, business law matters such as&#13;
competitive law, banking and insurance, securities, etc. In connection with judicial culture, most significant&#13;
areas include public relations, relationship with other branches of government, sociology and economic&#13;
impact ofjudicial decisions.&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
Conseio Nacional de la Mazistratura - CNM&#13;
1.    The Constitution entrusts to the CNM the powers to select and appoint judges and prosecutors with&#13;
the exception of those selected by popular election. The Council also is empowered to remove magistrates,&#13;
as well as to ratify them every seven years. The CNM, unlike judicial councils in other countries, does not&#13;
hold any responsibility for the management and administration of the court system.&#13;
2.    Previous to the 1993 Constitution, Peru has experimented various systems ofjudicial appointment.&#13;
With the 1933 Constitution, Supreme Court members were selected by the executive and legislative branches.&#13;
The appellate judges and prosecutors were selected by the executive from a "tern" proposed by the Supreme&#13;
Court. The trial judges and prosecutors were also selected by the executive from a "tern" proposed by the&#13;
respective appellate court. Finally, justices of peace were selected by the appellate courts. This system lasted&#13;
until the military regime of 1968.&#13;
3.    In 1969, the National Council of Justice was established with powers to select judges. The Council&#13;
had two representatives from the executive, two from the legislative, two from the judiciary, one from the&#13;
national federation of bar associations, one from the Lima bar association and one from each of the two&#13;
oldest universities. This composition in the Council's membership gave virtual control to the then current&#13;
regime whose control grew stronger when the representation of the Lima bar association and one of the&#13;
Universities (Cuzco) was eliminated.&#13;
4.    The Council selected but the executive appointed the magistrates. Until 1976, the executive always&#13;
appointed the candidates selected by the Council. However, in November 1976 such situation changed when&#13;
a Supreme Court candidate proposed by the Council was rejected by the executive. This prompted the&#13;
resignation of the president and vice-president of the Council.&#13;
5.    With the 1979 Constitution, the Magistracy Councils are established modeled after the previous&#13;
Council. The Councils would have no direct representation from the political branches but Supreme Court&#13;
nominees required Senate approval and judges continued to be appointed by the executive from a "tern"&#13;
proposed by the Councils. The National Council comprised the Public Prosecutor, two Supreme Court&#13;
representatives, one representative from the Federation of Bar Associations and two representatives from law&#13;
schools. Such Council proposed nominees for the Supreme Court and appellate courts. At each judicial&#13;
district, there existed a respective district council. Such district councils were formed by the senior public&#13;
prosecutor. The two most senior members of the appellate court and two representatives from the local bar&#13;
association. Such district councils proposed nominees for the trial courts. Unlike the previous Council, the&#13;
National Council had no representation from either the executive or legislative. In addition, there was an&#13;
open examination. However, the tern system allowed the executive to exercise much influence.&#13;
6.    On April 8, 1992, as part of the "autogolpe", the Councils ceased to exist. In such year, several&#13;
hundreds ofjudges were dismissed and replaced by provisional judges. In 1993, the Constitutional Congress,&#13;
charged with drafting the new constitution, determined to resolve the provisional status of most of the&#13;
Judiciary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
80&#13;
7.    Recognizing that the process to set up the new constitutional bodies involved in the selection of&#13;
judges would take considerable time, the Constitutional Congress established an interim Jury of Honor. The&#13;
Juiy consisted of a committee of five prestigious jurists charged with the evaluation of all provisional judges&#13;
and prosecutors and the filling of vacant positions. The Jury of Honor existed for two years until the CNM&#13;
came into being. In those two years, the Jury of Honor completed the selection of Supreme Court judges and&#13;
appelate and trial judges in the Lima judicial district. Despite much difficulties, the Juiy is recognized for&#13;
undertaking a merit-based selection process.&#13;
8.    The CNM, unlike previous Councils, has the following features: (a) contrary to the 1979&#13;
Constitution, there is only one national council; (b) the membership includes one representative from the&#13;
Supreme Court, one from the Public Ministry, one from the bar association, two from professional&#13;
associations, one from public universities and one from private universities; (c) it has a broader mandate than&#13;
the one afforded in the 1979 constitution; it appoints, ratifies and removes judges and prosecutors at all&#13;
levels; (d) the Council does not propose candidates in "tern" to the executive but selects the nominee and&#13;
makes the formal appointment; and (e) cannot select candidates unless they have approved the respective&#13;
training courses offered by the AM.&#13;
9.    It is widely recognized that the CNM is an important and positive step in improving the selection&#13;
system ofjudges. However, while the prospects of a judicial career remain unattractive, the best selection&#13;
system will fail. It is conditioned by the limited pool of well trained candidates. These limiting factors include&#13;
a deficient legal education present in the great majority of applicants plus the unattractive environment under&#13;
which judges operate with political control and limited resources.&#13;
10.   The CNM has initiated its operations in March 1995. Since then, it has completed the appointment of&#13;
all the positions held by provisional magistrates at the appelate level. It has now to complete the appointment&#13;
of all trial level positions held by provisional magistrates. To this effect, CNM has drawn up a time-based&#13;
plan, in coordination with AM, to complete such process (see Annex 1 for the policy letter)&#13;
11.   The project intends to support CNM, by providing technical assistance, in key areas identified during&#13;
project preparation such as perfecting its system of selection of magistrates, designing an adequate system of&#13;
evaluation and strengthening its management skills.&#13;

Annex 7&#13;
Defensoria del Pueblo - DP&#13;
1.   Defensoria del Pueblo, the Office of Public Defenders, is one of the new institutions established by the&#13;
1993 Constitution to promote democracy in Peru. The Articles of Constitutions 161 and 162, and the Ley&#13;
Organica de la Defensoria del Pueblo (law 26250) issued in 1995 govern the norms and functions of this&#13;
office and the role of ombudsman, or Defensor del Pueblo.&#13;
2.   DP is an autonomous organ of the State, whose mandate originates from Congress. Its specific&#13;
responsibilities include: (i) protecting the constitutional and fundamental rights of citizens and communities&#13;
before the power of the State; (ii) supervising the status of compliance by public administration with their&#13;
mandated obligations; and (iii) supervising the provisions of public services. Based on the experience learned&#13;
under the 1979, the new DP acts independently of the function of the Ministry of Public. DP prepares and&#13;
presents its budget before the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Budget Commission of Congress.&#13;
3.   The 1993 Constitution has established that DP is to be designated by Congress with two-thirds of&#13;
votes. DP will be elected for five years and can be reelected one more time for another five years. The first&#13;
ombudsman, Defensor del Pueblo, was elected in April 1996. Under his leadership, immediately the basic&#13;
organizational structure has been developed, and the office initiated its activity in September 1996. To&#13;
develop an efficient institution capable of responding to public demands quickly, DP's office plans to rely on&#13;
qualified, but a small number of professional and support staff, with reduced bureaucracy. In the initial stage,&#13;
DP's office plans to develop the functioning system for public attention and processing various types of&#13;
complaints (see chart below).&#13;
4.   DP plans to consolidate and expand its activities in a phased manner. In Lima, in addition to the&#13;
principal office of DP, it is expected to open five offices in the densely populated urban marginal areas, where&#13;
the incidence of poverty and the need for defense of basic rights are high (e.g., Cono Norte, Cono Sur, Ate-&#13;
Vitarte and el Callao). Furthermore, the Ley Organica del DP envisages gradual decentralization of DP's&#13;
office by establishing branch offices in all the departments in Peru; however, the speed of this process&#13;
critically depends on the availability of budgetary resources. Decentralized, departmental offices would&#13;
primarily rely on professionals in respective geographical areas so that the offices could benefit from their&#13;
knowledge of specific local situations and problems. DP's office also plans to work closely with university&#13;
students, who have shown enthusiasm and willingness to accumulate practical and professional experience as&#13;
promoters.&#13;
5.   Support to rural Andean regions is another priority area for this office. Rural Andean regions currently&#13;
face the challenging task of population migration ("poblaciones desplazadas")--legacy of the recent past years&#13;
that suffered from terrorist violence. With gradual restoration of peace, an increased number of people are&#13;
returning back home, and it is expected that their demand for DP's assistance in reestablishing the base of&#13;
their living with dignity, welfare and security would increase significantly. Under " Programa de Apoyo al&#13;
Repoblamiento", DP has recently initiated the coordination of this effort and has been working closely with&#13;
the other organs of the State, as well as donor agencies which have offered support in this area (e.g.,&#13;
USAID).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82&#13;
6. The proposed Bank project will support the institutional development of the DP's office in the areas of&#13;
(Q) its organizational structure and functions, norms and procedures-through advisory services, strategic&#13;
workshops, evaluation studies, and stafftraining; (i) environmental protection, native communities, and&#13;
cizen rights in the market economy-through studies and workshops-and the organization of the fonum  to&#13;
promote the coordination between the State and civil society, (iii) public campaign and dissemination of DP&#13;
activities, including the preparation and distnbution of materials in native languages and regional workshops;&#13;
and (iv) support to the first phase of decentralization efforts, by providing informatic and other logistic&#13;
support to central offices in Lima (Lima HDQ and Callao) and two offices in the other departments Ci.e.,&#13;
Piura, Arepa).&#13;

Annex 8&#13;
Typical Pilot Program for Implementation of&#13;
New Court Procedures and Or2anization&#13;
This section provides, first, the overview of the pilot program of the new court procedures and organization&#13;
("sistema corporativo"), and then more specifics on its implementation, i.e., (i) key steps involved in the&#13;
implementation of a typical pilot program of new court organization; (ii) a plan for the evaluation and&#13;
verification of the pilot program; and (iii) the timetable for pilot implementation in the selected districts. (The&#13;
latter part is provided in Spanish.)&#13;
Overview&#13;
The first pilot program was inaugurated in the Lambayeque district (civil courts in Chiclayo, departmental&#13;
capital) in November 1996 (a medium-size district), to be followed immediately in the Lima district in April&#13;
1997 (a large-size district). A typical pilot progran involves the following steps: (i) infrastructure&#13;
remodeling; (ii) installation of hardware and software ( "sistema de registro de expedientes"y "sistema de&#13;
seguimiento de casos"); (iii) rationalization and training of human resources; (iii) diffusion; and (iv)&#13;
evaluation and statistical verification. Because of its importance as the first district-wide exercise, the&#13;
experience of the Lambayeque program will be evaluated, and the lessons learned will be diffused and&#13;
incorporated into the subsequent pilot programs in the other districts of similar size (i.e., Cono Norte, Callao,&#13;
Piura, Cusco, Arequipa, the remaining labor courts in Lambayeque). Due to its large size and complexity, the&#13;
Lima program will be treated separately. Because an integrated system (combining both "sistema de registro&#13;
de expedientes" and "sistema de seguimiento de casos') will not be available until the 3rd quarter of 1997,&#13;
the implementation of the programs in Lambayeque will occur in two phases, starting with the installation of&#13;
"sistema de registro de expedientes". However, the pilot programs planned for the 3rd quarter of 1997&#13;
onwards would have only one phase, with shorter duration.&#13;
Prior to the implementation of the Lambayeque program, the design of the new court procedures and&#13;
organization and "sistema de registro de expedientes" were tested on a small scale in both anti-drug courts&#13;
and transitory courts in the Lima District during August-October, 1996, and necessary adjustments have been&#13;
made.&#13;
The implementation of the new court organization will be carried out as a joint effort of the central tedhnical&#13;
unit and the district-level commission. At the central level, three professional teams have been established&#13;
within the Judiciary to support the implementation process--one for the northern part of the country, second&#13;
for the remaining part of the country except for Lima, and third for Lima. It is anticipated that the&#13;
implementation of the Lima program will require separately treatment due to its complexity. At the local&#13;
level, a Comision de Coordinacion Distrital (five members, typically composed of the President of the&#13;
Superior Court, 1-2 vocales superiores, and 1-2 jueces especializados) will be created in each district. The&#13;
Comision de Coordinacion Distrital, with the technical assistance of the central unit, will be responsible for&#13;
the planning, implementation, and follow-up of the pilot program. (An operational manual for each district&#13;
has been prepared by the central technical unit.) Moreover, it is expected that the Comisiones de&#13;
Coordinacion Distrital of the Lambayeque district would eventually function as a regional center of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84&#13;
excellence and assist the implementation of the new court procedures and organization in the other districts&#13;
within the same northern region.&#13;

1. Etapas Claves y Tiempo Necesario&#13;
En los casos de Lambayeque and Lima including Callao and Cono Norte (un modulo de dos fases), el&#13;
proceso de inmplantacion dura nueve meses. Mas del 70% del trabajo de irnplantacion es realizado en los&#13;
primeros dos meses del proceso, el tiempo restante se mantienen en ejecucion las activitades de la Comision&#13;
de Coordinacion Distrital y de monitoreo y evaluacion de resultados. El modulo que sea implantado a partir&#13;
del tercer trinmestre de 1997 (un modulo de un fase) tendra el software de seguimiento de casos integrado a&#13;
una primera y unica fase de implantacion. Se estima que estas replicas de implantacion tendran una duracion&#13;
de cuatro meses, pues no sera necesario un seguimiento de mayor duracion. Las etapas claves en el proceso&#13;
de implantacion son las seguientes (algunas actividades seran implementadas sinmultaneamente):&#13;
* Adlequalfretrucu   (60 dfas): Acondicionar la infraestsructura actual para que responda al modelo&#13;
corporativo, orientado al usuanio del servicio, lo que permita que los equipos de especialistas y asistentes&#13;
se encuentren en ambientes separados del de los Magistrados a fin que estos cuenten con todas las&#13;
comodidates del caso para la eficiente administracion de justicia; manteniendo en ambientes separados el&#13;
area de servicios adminisrativos a fin que no se interfiera en las audiencias y diligencias propias del&#13;
proceso.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
85&#13;
* Dotar de Software y Hardware (60 dias): Establecer la automatizacion progresiva del Poder Judicial,&#13;
permitiendo la sistematizacion del seguirniento del proceso y de la gestion judicial, asi como brindar&#13;
servicios de jurisprudencia y normas legales, a traves de diferentes paquetes lo que permitira realizar la&#13;
labor en forma rapida, eficiente y oportuna.&#13;
* Racionalizar los Recursos Humanos (30 dias): Forrnar profesionales para que desarrollen la labor&#13;
jurisdiccional, a fin que establecer un programa de ingreso al Poder Judicial sustentado en la capacitacion&#13;
permanente, evaluacion periodica del rendimiento, acceso a nuevos funciones y posibilidad de entrar en la&#13;
carrera de Magistrado. Todo ello para brindar seguridad juridica al ciudadano y elevar la calidad de la&#13;
carrera judicial.&#13;
* Difund&amp;ry ValidarAcciones (30 dias): Asegurar la publicidad de todo proceso de camnbio a fin que no se&#13;
genere malestar en los abogados yjusticiables. Todo accion que se realice que genere cambio sera&#13;
refrendada por una comision conformada por Magistrados (Comision Distrital), personal de la Secretaria&#13;
Ejecutiva e incluso Abogados de reconocido prestigio.&#13;
. ElaborarEstadisficas (30 dias): Generar en forma sistematizada y a nivel nacional las estadisticas de la&#13;
labor judicial a fin de determinar las principales difucultades que se producen en los procesos judiciales,&#13;
poder medir la productividad efectiva de la administracion de justicia y realizar las acciones correctivas&#13;
que se precisen.&#13;

            Peru - Judicial Reform Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Judicial Reform Project assists Peru
            in improving judicial system performance by enhancing
            access, quality, independence, efficiency, and integrity.
            There are three components. Component One modernizes
            judicial administration and improves judicial performance in
            selected districts. Its first sub-component strengthens
            district offices and gives judges economic autonomy, designs
            a preferential fee scheme for low-income groups, and
            supports a public information campaign. Its second
            sub-component improves the quality, predictability, and
            timeliness of judicial decisionmaking; implements pilot
            programs in selected districts; forms forums discussing
            specific judgments; develops incentives; expands court
            libraries; implements pilot-tested court organization and
            case processing procedures; holds workshops; studies
            quantitative and qualitative indicators measuring
            performance; implements judicial information systems and
            statistics; and remodels physical facilities.  Component two
            establishes a judicial career system and improves judicial
            ethics and accountability. Its sub-components strengthen
            judicial selection and evaluation; develop judicial
            institutions and implement training programs; and strengthen
            the disciplinary system of the office supervising
            magistrates. Component three implements training programs
            for popularly elected lay judges and community authorities,
            refines laws and regulations; promotes alternative dispute
            resolution; and develops the Public Defender.
