Foreword&#13;
The explosion of international migration in the Middle East and&#13;
North Africa Region in the 1970s was a major development on the international&#13;
economic scene with profound implications for both the labor-importing and the&#13;
labor-exporting countries. The World Bank undertook a research study on the&#13;
subject in 1978 under the leadership of Ismail Serageldin and his group of&#13;
committed colleagues in the Technical Assistance and Special Studies Division&#13;
of the EMENA Projects Department. The study was completed in 1981 and the&#13;
Report has been widely disseminated. It has been published in book form this&#13;
year.&#13;
The set of simulation models developed by the Technical Assistance&#13;
and Special Studies Division and elaborated during the research project has&#13;
been applied to study manpower problems and planning issues in several&#13;
countries and proven to be a useful tool for manpower planning. The wide&#13;
availability and a full description of these models is important and to be&#13;
welcomed.&#13;

Preface&#13;
This document, published in four volumes as part of the World Bank's&#13;
staff working papers, is intended to set forth the mathematical formulation of&#13;
the Bank's various Manpower Planning Models, most of which have now been used&#13;
in a number of countries and studies, but whose technical documentation was&#13;
not hitherto available to the public.&#13;
- Applied Models are living entities, constantly changing and (we hope)&#13;
improving to meet the new requirements introduced by their users. The present&#13;
publication must therefore be seen as a snapshot in time, but one which&#13;
presents the interested user with the opportunity of reviewing the technical&#13;
documentation as well as the user's guides as they stand-at the beginning of&#13;
1983. They are not likely to change significantly until a new round of&#13;
intensive applications produces a new generation.&#13;
The technical presentation provides, for completeness, a detailed&#13;
discussion (pp. 98-132) of a simultaneous procedure method for the migration&#13;
model. This has not been implemented to date, partly because time and&#13;
resources constraints prevented its complete development and elaboration, but&#13;
it nevertheless sketches out the likely direction of our next round of&#13;
research and development efforts, planned for 1983/84.&#13;
It is important to emphasize, however, that while we were the main&#13;
protagonists in the development of these models, the work would not have been&#13;
possible without the support, guidance and incisive comments of many&#13;
colleagues in and outside the Bank. To all of them we owe a great debt of&#13;
intellectual and moral gratitude. We emphasize, however, that any errors or&#13;
shortcomings in the present manuscript are purely our own.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Among those in the Bank who provided constant support and&#13;
encouragement during the six year life of these manpower planning efforts, of&#13;
which this document is just a small part, we must thank in particular&#13;
Mr. Vinod Dubey, Chief Economist of the EMENA region, whose constant personal&#13;
and technical support from the earliest days to the present have made this task&#13;
possible. The long-term study efforts have also benc4itted from the strong&#13;
support of Messrs. R. Chaufournier, Vice-President of EMENA; and M.P. Benjenk,&#13;
currently Vice-President, External Relations and formerly Vice-President of&#13;
EMENA; and Messrs. A. David Knox, currently Vice-President for West Africa&#13;
(formerly Projects Director, EMENA); A. Karaosmanoglu, currently Vice-President&#13;
for East Asia and Pacific (formerly Director of ProRrams, EMENA), and M.P. Bart,&#13;
Director of Programs, EMENA; and A.S. El Darwish, Director of Projects, West&#13;
Africa (formerly Assistant Director of Projects, EMENA); and especially&#13;
Messrs. R. Picciotto, Director of Projects, EMENA; and J.J. Stewart, Assistant&#13;
Director of Projects, EMENA. A special mention is also needed of the support&#13;
given by Mr. D. Avramovic when he was Director of the Bank's Development&#13;
Economics Department, and Mr. S. Acharya when he was Research Advisor.&#13;
Many colleagues from the Bank have contributed valuable comments and&#13;
insights to the general studies of which these Models were the central part,&#13;
among these we must name S. Birks, C. Blitzer, F. Colaco, Z. Ecevit, I. Hume,&#13;
J.P. Jallade, T. King, G. Pennisi, R. Prosser, N. Sherbiny, C. Sinclair,&#13;
J. Socknat, and M. Wilson. The computer related work was ably done by Peter&#13;
and Tom Wolfe (Consultants). Earlier versions were programmed by A. McClinton&#13;
of the Phoenix Corporation. Applications on various countries were undertaken&#13;
with the support of G. Cima, B. Krishna, B. Smith, N. Pemmarazu, M. Youssef,&#13;
and M. Allak.&#13;

Section 1.0 Introduction&#13;
The purpose of this User's Guide is to provide&#13;
information to users of the International Migration Model on the features&#13;
and design of the Model, on what reports/outputs are available and on how&#13;
to prepare input data. An overview of the system is given in Section 2.&#13;
The reports and outputs to be produced by the Model are discussed&#13;
in detail in Section 3.0. System inputs are discussed in Section 4 and&#13;
the Appendices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Section 2.0 Overview&#13;
The International Migration Model simulates the manpower supplies&#13;
and demands in a number of separate localities. These will usually be&#13;
individual countries but may be portions of countries or even groups of&#13;
countries. The combined localities simulated are referred to as the global&#13;
region. Laborers not originating in one of the localities of the region&#13;
are referred to as rest of world expatriates and may be subdivided into&#13;
nationality categories. From time to time this document will refer to&#13;
nationality. This refers to the source locality of an individual or to a&#13;
rest of world expatriate nationality. Although two localities may actually&#13;
be parts of the same country, they are identified as separate nationalities&#13;
(perhaps more accurately "locationalities") for purposes of analysis. Since&#13;
each such "nationality" is identified by its corresponding locality ID, there&#13;
is little danger of confusion in data preparation or output interpretation.&#13;
The system is divided into four modules as shown in Figure 2.1. The&#13;
first module is the edit module which checks all of the input data cards for&#13;
errors and generates input data diagnostics and a listing of the input deck.&#13;
The input cards are described in general in Section 4.0 and in detail in&#13;
Appendix A. Diagnostic outputs produced by the edit module are listed in&#13;
Appendix B.&#13;
The edit module saves the edited input data in a specially formatted&#13;
file, the edited input file. The second module, the data listing module, can&#13;
optionally be used to obtain a formatted listing of the edited input data from&#13;
this file. The formatted listing highlights data changes between simulation&#13;
years and is useful in ensuring that the input data are correctly specified.&#13;
It also serves an as easy-to-read record of simulation inputs.&#13;
The third module is the simulation module where the input data is&#13;
actually used to calculate manpower and migration projections. The module&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
contains several models. These models are:&#13;
(i) Labor Force Model;&#13;
(ii) Manpower Requirement Model;&#13;
(iii) Educational Simulation Model (ESM);&#13;
(iv) Manpower Policy Model; and&#13;
(v) Migration Model&#13;
The Labor Force Model maintains the national and expatriate labor&#13;
force for each locality on an annual basis. Each year the model accounts&#13;
for attrition, leakage, move-ins, move-outs and new supplies of laborers.&#13;
The Manpower Requirements Model calculates the total manpower&#13;
requirements by sector/occupational categories to achieve the desired tar-&#13;
get outputs. It also calculates the net manpower requirements by sector/&#13;
occupational categories after comparing the total manpower stock. There is&#13;
a capability to directly input manpower requirements for sectors which have&#13;
readily available data.&#13;
The Education/Training Simulation Model (ESM) is based upon a sim-&#13;
plified version of a model developed by UNESCO. It simulates an educational&#13;
system made up of a user-specified course structure. User-supplied input&#13;
controls the course entrance levels and repetition, dropout, and promotion&#13;
rates. The user can enter course-specific skill levels of school leavers&#13;
permitting their allocation into the labor force. Teacher requirements are&#13;
also computed.&#13;
The Manpower Policy Model (MPM) compares the net manpower require-&#13;
ments with local manpower supplies, and attempts to allocate local laborers&#13;
in accordance with a priority matrix, in which the priority and proportion&#13;

of nationalization in each sector/occupation are specified by policy&#13;
makers. In addition, MPM also estimates global achievable output, net&#13;
requirements for expatriates and surplus/deficient national manpower in&#13;
each locality.&#13;
The Migration Model computes the pattern of labor flows among the&#13;
localities based on user-supplied input which specifies regional patterns&#13;
of worker importation. It interacts with the Labor Force Model to simulate&#13;
the movement of laborers according to these flows.&#13;
The final module is the reports module. It takes the outputs of&#13;
the various models of the simulation module and generates the reports&#13;
described in Section 3.0, including consolidation reports for the region as&#13;
a whole.&#13;
Together, the five models of the simulation module:&#13;
1. Estimate labor force inventories and leakages;&#13;
2. Estimate labor force requirements;&#13;
3. Estimate manpower supplies from education/training systems;&#13;
4. Perform labor force supply poolings;&#13;
5. Perform manpower allocation of current year school leavers&#13;
according to poolings;&#13;
6. Perform user-specified labor migration among localities.&#13;
7. Estimate non-labor force movements due to labor force movements.&#13;
8. Calculate local net manpower requirements.&#13;
9. Calculate local achievable outputs.&#13;
10. Calculate regional net manpower requirements;&#13;
11. Calculate regional achievable outputs; and&#13;
12. Estimate net importation/exportation of "rest of world"&#13;
expatriates at both the local and the regional levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
Section 3.0 System Outputs&#13;
The International Migration Model will generate both printed&#13;
reports and diagnostic outputs. The contents of reports generated by&#13;
the Model are described in the remainder of this section. The diagnostic&#13;
outputs which describe errors committed in input preparations are in&#13;
Appendix B.&#13;
The reports are labeled with a 3-letter code (e.g., MOI, M02,&#13;
etc.) beginning with a letter which identifies the type of report. The&#13;
years to be included in the reports as well as the report ID's car. be&#13;
separately selected for each locality and for the global output. The reports&#13;
are selected using the G05 card, with the years being specified on the&#13;
C03 card. Alternatively, specific reports can be selected using special&#13;
control cards for the report module.&#13;
The reports can be divided into five major categories:&#13;
(i) Labor Force Status Reports;&#13;
(ii)  Manpower Requirements Reports;&#13;
(iii) Education/Training and Manpower Supply Reports;&#13;
(iv)  Manpower Policy Implications Reports; and&#13;
(v)  Highlights Reports.&#13;

Section 4.0 System Inputs&#13;
The input to the system consists of a card deck and optionally a&#13;
master file. This section will describe:&#13;
(1) How a master file is used as part of the input;&#13;
(2) What data are required.&#13;
Since the master file is in the same format as the data cards this&#13;
section will first describe the general card format to be used. Secondly, the&#13;
master file will be described including the rules for updating. The remainder&#13;
of the section will describe the cards needed for the various sections of the&#13;
model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
4.1 General Card Format&#13;
Although the data items vary for each card type, the first ten&#13;
columns are similar. This field is reserved to contain system identification&#13;
information as described below:&#13;
Card Column                              Description&#13;
1                         Card type identifier which identifies the submodel&#13;
or type of data being entered.&#13;
2 - 3                     Remainder of the card type identifier.    These are&#13;
numeric digits (e.g., "02").&#13;
4 - 6                     Locality identification field.    These 3 characters&#13;
are available to the user to identify the locality&#13;
associated with the data. The following codes can&#13;
be entered:&#13;
ID - three-character locality identifier (defined&#13;
on a G08 card).&#13;
"GLB" - data for global reports&#13;
"ALL" - data applies to all localities (and global&#13;
if appropriate) which do not otherwise appear&#13;
in the input with the same card type in&#13;
columns 1-3. (Thus "ALL" may be used to enter&#13;
data for some or all localities.)&#13;
7 -10                     Sequence number field which is used to generate&#13;
the desired order of input of cards of the same&#13;
type. It is also used in the updating procedure&#13;
described in Section 4.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
4.2 Master File&#13;
The master file is used to allow the user to submit smaller input&#13;
decks. This section will describe the use of the file on input.&#13;
In either Update ("U") or Sensitivity ("S") runs the edit program&#13;
will first merge the entire input data deck with the input data stored in the&#13;
master file specified on the input card. This merge procedure will make use&#13;
of the card ID (Col 1-3), locality identifier (Col 4-6), and the card sequence&#13;
number (Col 7-10).&#13;
The main features of the updating are shown in the table below:&#13;
Feature                               Description of How to Use&#13;
REPLACE                      Duplicate card ID, locality identifier, and card&#13;
sequence number of card to be replaced.&#13;
INSERT                       Use card sequence number not in master file.&#13;
This number may be duplicated in the input deck&#13;
if more than one card is to be inserted.&#13;
DELETE                       Duplicate card ID, locality identifier and card&#13;
sequence number of cartd to be deleted. Place&#13;
DELETE in Col 11-16.&#13;
DELETE A GROUP (ALL          Duplicate card ID, locality identifier and card&#13;
SAME ID AND LOCALITY)        sequence number of first card to be deleted.&#13;
Place DELETE in Col 11-16, add last sequence in&#13;
Column 17-20. The last sequence need not appear&#13;
on any card of the master file.&#13;
In the event that a new master file is written, the output will&#13;
be resequenced starting at 0001 and incrementing by 2 for each card type and&#13;
locality.  A listing will be generated at the same time.&#13;
&#13;

Figure 4.1 illustrates part of an update run. Only the card ID,&#13;
locality ID (R04) and sequence numbers are listed. The left-most column con-&#13;
tains a section of the original master file, the next column contains the&#13;
input update cards, next is the resultant update and then is shown a resequenced&#13;
version of the updated information: the new master file. The right-most column&#13;
contains a description of the updating operations.&#13;

The CO1 card allows users to define a base year and to select any&#13;
number of simulation years desired. It also contains a flag indicating if a&#13;
new master file is desired.&#13;
The C02 card set allows users to enter any description about the&#13;
simulation run being requested. The description contained in the first card&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
will be printed at the top of each page of the reports generated by the system.&#13;
Any additional cards are printed at the beginning of the reports. Although&#13;
not required it is strongly recommended that a complete description of the&#13;
run be made by the user. Each locality can have its own C02 card set.&#13;
The C03 card is entered for each locality and used to define the&#13;
years of reports.&#13;
G01 cards allow user to identify themselves on the simulation&#13;
output. There could be as many of these cards as the number of people&#13;
involved in the analyses. If these cards are present, the information provided&#13;
will be printed on the output reports.&#13;
The G02 set of cards allows users to define sector ID's and descrip-&#13;
tions. The sector ID's provided in this set of cards must be used consistently&#13;
throughout the simulation run and will constitute a dictionary. The ID's&#13;
entered could be alpha-numeric combinations. This set of cards is required.&#13;
The G03 set of cards allows users to define occupation ID's and&#13;
descriptions in a manner consistent with the sector definition cards. The&#13;
occupation ID's must be consistent throughout the simulation run. This set&#13;
of cards is required.&#13;
The G04 set of cards allows users to define nationality ID's for&#13;
the rest of world expatriate nationalities. This set of cards is required.&#13;
The G05 cards allows users to select reports provided by the&#13;
system. The user may select different reports from each of the localities as&#13;
well as global reports. The user can:&#13;
(1) Identify the reports desired;&#13;
(2) Identify the reports not wanted (remainder generated);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
(3) Specify that "ALL" are wanted; or&#13;
(4) Specify that none are wanted.&#13;
If this card is not entered reports can later be selected with a report phase&#13;
control card.&#13;
The G06 set of cards allows users to specify the distribution list&#13;
of reports selected, number of copies to be distributed for each recipient,&#13;
etc. The information provided on this card will be printed on reports&#13;
produced by the system. This card is optional.&#13;
The G07 set of cards allows users to attach footnotes to selected&#13;
reports. A footnote may be continued on a second card by duplicating the&#13;
report ID and the footnote number. The footnotes will be printed in the order&#13;
that they are found in the input deck. The footnote will only apply to&#13;
reports from the locality. If the footnote is desired to appear on a specific&#13;
report from more than one locality, it must be entered for all of the desired&#13;
localities or using "ALL" as the locality designator if it is to be printed&#13;
for all localities.&#13;
The G08 set of cards allows users to define locality ID's,&#13;
locality descriptions, and nationality descriptions.    One set of G08 cards&#13;
is required for each simulation run.&#13;
The G09 set of cards allows users to define pool ID's and descrip-&#13;
tions in a manner consistent with the sector definition cards. One set of G09&#13;
cards is required for each simulation run.&#13;
The GIO set of cards allows users to define a sector grouping to be&#13;
used in the HOI report. This set of cards is optional; if the cards are not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
used then the sector grouping portion of the H0l report will not be printed.&#13;
4.3.2     Labor Force Input&#13;
This input is used to define the labor force in the locality. It&#13;
allows users to enter:&#13;
(1) The base year labor force;&#13;
(2) Attrition rates&#13;
The labor force input is briefly described below:&#13;

L05             Leakage rates - Locals                      1 set per locality&#13;
The LO1 set of cards allows users to provide data on the existing&#13;
local    labor force by sector and occupation in the base year.    The&#13;
sector/occupation ID's entered on this card or set of cards must have been&#13;
defined in card G02 and card G03. Any cells not filled are assumed to&#13;
contain no local workers in the base year. This card set is required for&#13;
each locality in the simulation run.&#13;
The L02 set of cards allows users to specify attrition rates for local&#13;
labor force by year, by occupation/sector. In order to ease the input preparation&#13;
the keyword "ALL" may be used in either the Sector or the Occupation ID field&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
to identify a constant value across the sector or occupation. Attrition rates&#13;
remain in effect until changed by a subsequent card. They are all initialized&#13;
to zero in the base year.&#13;
The L03 set of cards has a similar meaning as Card LO1, Base Year&#13;
Local Labor Force Card, except that the locality ID's must be entered in this&#13;
card. If this card is not used the base year expatriate labor counts are zero.&#13;
The L04 set of cards has a similar meaning as Card L02, Local Labor&#13;
Force Attrition Card, except that the locality ID's must be entered in this&#13;
card. Attritional expatriates are returned to their home country. "ALL" may&#13;
be used as a Sector, Occupation, or Locality ID.&#13;
The L05 set of cards is used to identify local workers, if any, that&#13;
leak out of their jobs into the available labor pools. If a locality is an&#13;
importing locality for a pool, workers that leak into the pool will be reallocated&#13;
into the local labor force. If a locality is not an importing locality for a&#13;
pool, workers that leak into the pool may be exported to work in an importing&#13;
locality.&#13;
4.3.3.    Manpower Requirements Input&#13;
The manpower requirement input allows users to calculate the projected&#13;
required labor force at the sector-occupation level. This is done by calculating&#13;
the requirements at the sectoral level and then using distribution rates to&#13;
estimate the occupational distribution.&#13;
The user can enter data for any two of: sector product output;&#13;
sector productivity; sector employment. The third one is computed from the&#13;
two entered as data. The same two need not be entered for every sector. (If&#13;
all three are entered for a sector then the sector productivity entered as&#13;
data is not used, but is checked to ensure that it is within 5% of the value&#13;
computed by dividing sector output by sector employment.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Each of the-three sector quantities can be specified directly on a&#13;
yearly basis, or growth rates can be specified to be applied after a particu-&#13;
lar year. In addition, if values are entered for two non-successive years&#13;
then the data for intermediate years will be computed by interpolation.&#13;
The occupation distribution rates may be entered on a yearly basis.&#13;
They may also be interpolated between values for non-successive years.&#13;
The manpower requirements cards are summarized in the table below:&#13;
Card ID                                     Description&#13;
D02                               Base year sector product output&#13;
D03                               Sector product streaming (yearly)&#13;
D05                               Sector product output growth&#13;
D08                               Base year sector productivity&#13;
D09                               Sector productivity streaming (yearly)&#13;
Dll                               Sector productivity growth rate&#13;
D14                               Base year sectoral employment&#13;
D15                               Sectoral employment growth rate&#13;
Dl9                               Sectoral employment streaming (yearly)&#13;
D20                               Sectoral/occupation employment distribu-&#13;
tion rates&#13;
The D02 set of cards allows users to enter base year sectoral out-&#13;
put. The choice of units for use in sector output and sector productivity is&#13;
arbitrary but it is left to the user to make certain that consistent units&#13;
are used. Sector output divided by productivity should yield total manpower.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
The D03 card can be used to enter sector product output for years&#13;
after the base year. Values will be interpolated for years not specified&#13;
between years which are specified. Values after the last year entered with&#13;
D03 cards (or D02 cards) are computed using growth rates from the D05 cards.&#13;
The growth rates are entered as percentages on the D05 card and remain in effect&#13;
until replaced. (Note that D05 growth rates are only used to compute values&#13;
after years directly entered on D03 or D02 cards; they are not used to extend&#13;
sector output values computed from sector employment and sector productivity&#13;
data when D02 and D03 cards are not used.)&#13;
The Sectoral Productivity is entered in a manner consistent with the&#13;
Sectoral Product Output. The D08 set of cards allows users to enter base&#13;
year sectoral productivities. The D09 and Dll cards are used in a fashion&#13;
analogous to the D03 and D05 cards.&#13;
The base year sectoral employment must be entered using the D14 card&#13;
if it differs from that obtained by summing the values on the L01 and L03 cards.&#13;
The D19 and D15 cards are used in a fashion analogous to the D03 and D05 cards.&#13;
The sectoral employment estimates are calculated for each sector as&#13;
a whole. The D20 card set is used to obtain sector/occupational distribution&#13;
of a given sectoral employment. Summation across occupational classification&#13;
for a given sector must be equal to 100%. This distribution defaults to the&#13;
distribution of employees in the base year (LOI and L03 cards). Data are&#13;
specified by year. If data are not specified for a year they are interpolated&#13;
between the closest years before and after that year; values after the last&#13;
year specified default to the last year.&#13;
4.3.4      Educational Training System Input&#13;
The Educational/Training Simulafion Model (ESM) or ETS, is used to&#13;
train locals and pool the graduates and dropouts by labor skill for entry&#13;
into the work force. The input for this section is contained on "El' and "S"&#13;
cards which allow the user to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Define the educational structure&#13;
Set base year enrollments&#13;
Identify intakes to the system&#13;
Specify promotion, dropout and repetition rates&#13;
Define teacher groups&#13;
Define manpower pools in terms of educational qualification&#13;
and probability that the individual will enter labor force&#13;
Maintain school age population by age and sex&#13;
*    Define "leakage" rates for graduates and dropouts&#13;
The cards used are described in the table below:&#13;
Card ID                                        Description&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
The same educational structure is used for all localities. The EOI&#13;
card is used to define the constants and sizes of the system. It contains:&#13;
The number of courses (maximum of gal&#13;
The number of age groups per course (maximum of 6)&#13;
The number of teacher groups (maximum of 30)&#13;
The minimum legal age to work&#13;
The minimum age to enter school&#13;
The Dummy courses to be used for males and females who have never&#13;
attended school&#13;
The E03 cards are used to enter the base year enrollments of the&#13;
courses described using E04 cards. An E03 card must be present for each&#13;
course and each locality. It contains an entry for each age group within each&#13;
course.&#13;
The structure of the system is described using E04 cards. These&#13;
cards describe each course in terms of:&#13;
Course title (24 characters)&#13;
Associated teacher group&#13;
Ideal age of enrollment&#13;
Follow-on courses that graduates of this course are qualified&#13;
to enter&#13;
Sex of enrollees in this course&#13;
One set of E04 cards is required for the simulation.&#13;
The E05 card is used to enter teacher group titles. The same titles&#13;
apply for all localities.&#13;
The E06 set of cards is used to identify the fraction of the course&#13;
enrollees who will repeat or drop out of the course. The remainder graduate and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
are distributed to the various follow-on courses using the Promotion Distri-&#13;
bution Data (PRDD's) provided. Data may be entered each year; values for&#13;
years not specified are obtained by interpolation and by using values for the&#13;
last year specified for all years after that year.&#13;
The E07 cards are used to provide the entrance levels into various&#13;
courses. Any course may be identified on an E07 card.&#13;
The E09 card is used to enter the student/teacher ratio. This infor-&#13;
mation is used to estimate the size of the teacher labor force.&#13;
As has been previously described, ESM also groups like educational&#13;
skills together in labor pools. This is done by requiring the user to enter&#13;
a complete list of which courses enter which pool. This is accomplished by&#13;
means of the S06 set of cards. As the courses are upgraded in future years&#13;
the corresponding pool can be changed. The S05 set of cards is used to specify&#13;
participation rates to be applied to the graduates and dropouts from each&#13;
course before placing them in the pools.&#13;
The underaged school leavers are held by course number and age until&#13;
they reach the minimum age to work. The S04 set of cards is used to initialize&#13;
the pools in the base year. The S09 set of cards is used to allow some of the&#13;
underaged to "illegally" enter the labor force prior to reaching the minimum&#13;
age to work.&#13;
ine S10 card set allows additional entries or withdrawals from the&#13;
labor pools.  It can be used by the user to retrain members of various pools.&#13;
The Sll card set allows the definition of leakage rates of pooled&#13;
graduates and dropouts. Leaked individuals in non-importing localities are&#13;
available for importation by importing localities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.3.5.    Manpower Policy Input&#13;
The Manpower Policy Model inputs are contained on "P"I cards. These&#13;
inputs allow users to:&#13;
Enter the correspondence between labor pools and sector/occupation cells&#13;
Enter the nationalization levels&#13;
Enter priorities for worker distribution&#13;
Maintain local population by nationality and age group&#13;
The cards used in this submodel are described below:&#13;
Card ID             Description&#13;
PO1            Associated Labor Pool Identification&#13;
P02            Nationalization Goals&#13;
P03            Priority of Sector/Occupation&#13;
P04            Time  lag of Allocation&#13;
P06            Population Group Definition&#13;
P07            Base Year Population&#13;
P09            Associated Population Movement&#13;
PlO            Expatriate Distribution&#13;
Pl1            Base Year Labor Force in Transition&#13;
P12            Birth Rate&#13;
P13            Population Mortality Rates&#13;
P14            Expatriate Distribution Overage&#13;
A separate policy model may be set up for each locality. With the&#13;
exception of the P06 card, each of these card types are locality specific.&#13;
The P01 card is used to identify the manpower pool corresponding&#13;
with each sector/occupation cell. The special identifier "ALL" may be used&#13;
in a manner similar to the L01 card to allow ease of data entry. The P02&#13;
card contains Nationalization goals in percent. The employment level for&#13;
Nationals will never exceed this level (unless enough nationals are available&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
to meet all such goals) and it will be used in the manpower allocation&#13;
routine as part of the distribution scheme. The default for cells not&#13;
entered is 100.0 percent. The P03 card contains the cell priorities. Cells&#13;
with the highest priority will draw their allotment from the pool first.&#13;
The reallocation of Labor Force leakages is accomplished by intro-&#13;
ducing a time lag distribution. Nationals from each locality who depart the&#13;
locality are grouped into the standard labor pools. Time lag distribution, which&#13;
can be entered by the user for each pool and varied every year, is entered&#13;
on the P04 card. Three numbers are entered giving the percent of pool&#13;
members to be reallocated in one, two, and three years. (These not reallocated&#13;
in one, two, or three years are allocated immediately.) The Pl1 card set is used&#13;
to indicate the number of workers in transition by labor pool during the base&#13;
year. The card is optional and defaults to zero. /&#13;
In order to assist in the analysis of required regional infrastructures,&#13;
the Manpower Policy Model will maintain a regional population by Nationality and&#13;
age group. The P06 card set, which is entered with the uniform definition data,&#13;
will define the age groupings. Male and Female population figures will be&#13;
separately maintained within each age group. The P07 card set is used to enter&#13;
the population in the base year. Birth rates and mortality rates are entered on&#13;
the P12 and P13 cards, respectively.&#13;
The P09 card will allow the user to indicate a deviation in average&#13;
family size and structure from the Regional Norm. Associated non-labor force&#13;
population movement will be calculated for both workers entering and leaving&#13;
the region. The program will default to the population distribution of the&#13;
Nationality involved. The P09 card will allow users to indicate a different&#13;
population distribution, if desired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
The final user inputs allow the user to alter the ratio of&#13;
expatriate groups working.in a specific sector/occupation. After allocation&#13;
of nationals, including those returning from other localities but not including&#13;
those migrating to other localities, the model allocates expatriates to fill any&#13;
remaining labor requirements. The P10 card allows the user to specify either the&#13;
target ratios of expatriates for each cell or the ratios of newly imported expatriate&#13;
The P14 card allows the user to specify the allowed overage of expatriates&#13;
(relative to the P10 targets) when unfilled positions are filled. The importation&#13;
of expatriates is subject to constraints imposed by the M03 card which specifies&#13;
the localities that may import workers and for each of them, the nationalities&#13;
that may be inported.&#13;
4.3.6     Migration Data Input&#13;
The Migration Data inputs are contained on "M" cards. These inputs allow&#13;
users to specify information used in determining the migration of workers between&#13;
localities. The cards used are:&#13;
Card ID                  Description&#13;
M03              Labor Importer/Exporter Classification&#13;
The M03 card allows users to classify localities as labor importers and&#13;
labor exporters. A sequence of one or more allocation levels can be defined for&#13;
each labor pool. Migration of workers is computed for the lowest allocation level&#13;
first, and then for successively higher levels. At each allocation level some&#13;
localities are classified as labor importers and others as exporters. (Rest of&#13;
world expatriate nationalities can also be classified as exporters.) The use&#13;
of several allocation levels allows for the simulation of replacement migration&#13;
since a locality may export at one level and then import at a higher level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
4.4       Card Input Deck Set Up&#13;
The card input deck may be placed in any order that the user&#13;
desires.  It will be initially sorted to card ID, locality ID, and se-&#13;
quence number orders. There may be either a complete data deck or a&#13;
series of overriding cards to be merged with the Master File specified&#13;
on the CO1 card. Input order will be maintained for duplicate ID and&#13;
sequence number cards.&#13;
The table below shows a listing of the cards required to run&#13;
the model. The "uniform definition" cards provide definitions which&#13;
apply to all localities. The "global reports" cards provide data used&#13;
in preparing the global reports. The "local" cards provide data for a&#13;
locality and are divided into those used in the base year and those&#13;
used for every year after the base year.&#13;

4.5      Card Punching Conventions&#13;
A complete description of each type of card is given in Appendix A.&#13;
This section includes some general notes on conventions to be observed when&#13;
punching cards (or preparing data sheets for punching).&#13;
4.5.1    Numeric Values&#13;
Values which are indicated in the card description of Appendix A&#13;
as integer must punched without a decimal point. They should also be punched&#13;
as far to the right as possible within the field.&#13;
Values which are not indicated in the card description of Appendix A&#13;
as inteRer can be punched with or without a decimal point and may have a frac-&#13;
tional part if a decimal point is used. If the decimal point is not used, the&#13;
value should be punched as far to the right as possible within the field.&#13;
A non-integer numeric value may also be expressed in scientific&#13;
(exponential) form. In this case a number is followed by the letter E and&#13;
an integer. The value represented is the number multiplied by 10 raised to&#13;
* Required for the first year of simulation and optional in subsequent&#13;
years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
the power denoted by the integer following E. For example, 6.8E5 represents&#13;
680000; 3.22E-4 represents .000322.&#13;
4.5.2    Identifiers&#13;
Identifiers (or ID's) such as sector identifiers and occupation&#13;
identifiers are entered in 3-column fields. Any alphanumeric combination of&#13;
characters can be used for an identifier. It is recommended that strings of&#13;
characters be used which abbreviate the name of the group being identified;&#13;
e.g., "AGR" for agriculture, "PRO" for professional, "ARB" for Arabian, etc.&#13;
If an ID has fewer than three characters then the characters must be posi-&#13;
tioned within the 3-column field in exactly the same way each time the ID is&#13;
used. Also, blanks and zeros are not equivalent in an ID (as they are at&#13;
the beginning of a numeric field). For example, all of these are different&#13;
ID's:  it , it    1 "1, "1 1",  "001"l.&#13;
4.5.3    Consistency of Units&#13;
The user must ensure that consistent units are used throughout the&#13;
input data. This is especially important in the case of sector outputs and&#13;
productivity, where there is a great deal of freedom in choosing the units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix A&#13;
Card Formats&#13;
The purpose of this appendix is to describe each of the cards&#13;
in the use in the International Migration Model. The description includes:&#13;
* A listing of the fields of the card&#13;
* Notes on the allowed values which can be entered&#13;
in the fields&#13;
* Notes on default settings and extent of definition of&#13;
the data.&#13;
Section 4.0 describes how the cards interrelate with one another and the&#13;
model.&#13;

Note:&#13;
1)   Column 11 must be "B", "U", or "S".&#13;
2)   The old master file ID is required for "U" and "S" runs and&#13;
is not used for "B" runs; the new master file ID is required&#13;
for "B" and "U" runs and is not used for "S" runs.&#13;
3)   The base year is one year earlier than the earliest year&#13;
entered on any data card.&#13;
4)   The last year of the simulation must be greater than the base&#13;
year. Data cards after the last year will be ignored. There&#13;
cannot be more than 10 simulation years.&#13;

Note:&#13;
(1) Year must be greater than the base year on the COI card.&#13;
(2) Pool ID must be defined on a G09 card, or "ALL" to specify all pools.&#13;
(3) Allocation level number must be a positive integer. Migration of workers&#13;
is computed for the lowest allocation level   first, and then for successively&#13;
higher levels. Each allocation level is completely processed before the&#13;
next higher level is processed. (Level numbers need not be consecutive -&#13;
and the lowest level need not be number 1.)&#13;
(4) Locality/Nationality ID must be defined on a G08 card or a G04 card.&#13;
(5)  Locality/Nationality Classification Code must be "I" to specify an&#13;
importing locality or "E" to specify an exporting locality or&#13;
nationality. A rest of world expatriate nationality may not be specified&#13;
as an importer.&#13;
(6) No locality may appear (as exporting or importing) if it has appeared as&#13;
an importing locality at a lower allocation level for the same pool. (Thus&#13;
no locality may ever appear as an importing locality at more than one&#13;
allocation level; an exporting locality at one allocation level may not be&#13;
an importing locality at a lower level.)&#13;
(7) If no exporters are specified for a given allocation level, the program&#13;
will assume that all localities which are not importing localities at the&#13;
given level or at a lower level are exporting localities at the given level.&#13;
All rest of world expatriate nationalities are also assumed to be exporters&#13;
in this case.&#13;
(8) If no importers or exporters are specified for a given allocation level,&#13;
the program will assume that no allocations take place at that level. If&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
A-39&#13;
that level is the only one for the specified pool and year, then there&#13;
are no importing localities for the pool in that year.&#13;
(9) The default for a pool in the first year is no importing localities.&#13;
(10)  Data apply until replaced.   If any allocation levels are specified for a&#13;
pool in a year they completely replace all allocation levels specified&#13;
for the pool for earlier years.&#13;
Exawple:&#13;
Suppose there are seven localities LC1,...,LC7, two rest of world expatriate&#13;
nationalities RW1 and RW2, and three successive allocations:&#13;
1) Locality LC1 imports from all other localities and rest of world&#13;
nationalities;&#13;
2) Localities LC2 and LC3 import from localities LC4, LC6,&#13;
and LC7 and expatriate nationality RW2;&#13;
3) Locality LC5 imports from locality LC7.&#13;
The following cards can be used to classify the localities for pool LAB in&#13;
year 1981:&#13;
M03ALL00011981LABlOLClI&#13;
M03ALL00021981LAB2OLc2ILC3ILC4ELC6ELC7EIRW2E&#13;
103ALLO0031981LAB30LCSlLC7E&#13;
Note that allocation level numbers 10, 20, and 30 are used for the three&#13;
allocations. Any three positive integers in the same order (eg., 1,2,3 )&#13;
could be used instead.&#13;

defined on a GOS card.&#13;
(2) Year must be greater than the base year on the C01 card.&#13;
(3) Sector ID must be defined on the G02 card, or "ALL" which&#13;
indicates that the proportions apply to all sectors.&#13;
(4) Occupation ID must be defined on the G03 card, or "ALL" which&#13;
indicates that the proportions apply to all occupations.&#13;
(5) Nationality ID of workers must be defined on the G08 card or the G04&#13;
card. The locality ID of employment specified in columns 4-6 may not&#13;
be used.&#13;
(6)  Proportion uumbers are used to define the allowed overage of expatriates&#13;
when unfilled positions are filled. If the flag column 21 is "S" then&#13;
the proportions are Suedj ,ith the PIO proportions for the correspcndin2&#13;
expatriate positions.  For example, if the P10 valuc for a positiLn is&#13;
.20 and the corresponding P14 value is .30 then tht relative proportion&#13;

of expatriates after Importation (or brougbt in by importation if&#13;
the U option is used on the P10 card) will not exceed .5 . If the&#13;
flag in coumn 21 is "R" then the proportions are Relative to the&#13;
P10 proportions for the correspondinig expatriate positions. For&#13;
example, a P14 proportion of type R and value .6 determines the&#13;
maximum proportion after importation to be 60% above the P10 proportion.&#13;
In the   first  example, P10 proportion .20 and P14 proportion .30, but&#13;
type R, importation will not raise the relative proportion of expatriates&#13;
after importation   (or brought in by importation if the U option is used&#13;
on the PlO card) to more than .26.&#13;
(7) Proportions of type S must be between zero and one; proportions of&#13;
type R must be non-negative but may exceed 1.&#13;

Data Listing Program Control Cards&#13;
This appendix describes how to prepare control cards&#13;
for the data listing program. The cards select the&#13;
localities and/or card types for which data are to&#13;
be listed.&#13;
&#13;

Data Listing Program Control Cards&#13;
The data listing program control cards are used to select the&#13;
localities and/or card types for which data are to be listed. The control&#13;
cards are optional; if they are not used then data will be listed for all&#13;
card types and localities.&#13;
A control card begins with "LOC" in columns 1-3 if the card selects&#13;
localities or "CRD" in columns 1-3 if the card selects card types. The three-&#13;
column locality identifiersor card types identifiers are entered in columns&#13;
4-6, 7-9, etc. These special identifiers are allowed:&#13;
ALL - used to select all localities or card types;&#13;
UNF - used for a locality identifier to select uniform&#13;
definition specifications;&#13;
GLB - used for a locality identifier to select global report&#13;
specifications.&#13;
As many control cards as desired may be used. If ALL is selected for locality&#13;
it should be the only selection for locality, and similarly for card type.&#13;
Little checking of the control cards is performed and unrecognized localities&#13;
and card types are ignored. If no localities (or card types) are selected all&#13;
of them will be reported. The following example control cards select listing&#13;
of the P09 and P10 cards for all localities:&#13;

APPENDIX D&#13;
REPORT PROGRAM CONTROL CARDS&#13;
This Appendix describes how to prepare control&#13;
cards for the report program. The cards select&#13;
the report types, years, and localities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
Report Program Control Cards&#13;
The report program    control cards are used to specify which&#13;
reports are to be printed. There are five types of cards; they are described&#13;
in Sections 1-5 below. Section 6 has a complete example.&#13;
1. The REPORT Card&#13;
The REPORT Card is used to select the printing of one or more&#13;
reports. At least one REPORT card must be used for a run. (All the other cards&#13;
are optional.) The card has this format:&#13;
Columns                Contents&#13;
1-6                  REPORT&#13;
11-13                 locality identifier&#13;
14-16                 report identifier&#13;
17-20                 first year&#13;
21-24                 second year&#13;
The locality identifier in columns 11-13 may be the identifier of a locality&#13;
or GLB to specify global reports or ALL to specify all localities, or&#13;
it may be the identifier of a 'locality group' defined on a LGROUP card as&#13;
described in Section 2 below. The report identifier in columns 14-16 may&#13;
be the identifier of a report (e.g., M02, H03) or ALL to specify all reports,&#13;
or it may be the identifier of a 'report group' defined on a RGROUP card as&#13;
described in Section 3 below. The year in columns 17-20 (or 21-24, etc.) may be&#13;
an actual simulation year or the base year, or it may be the identifier or a 'year group'&#13;
defined on a YGROUP card as described in Section 4 below.&#13;
Following are some sample REPORT cards. The first one specifies the P09&#13;
report for locality QAT for 1978. The second one specifies the H01 report for&#13;
all localities for 1980. The third one specifies all global reports for 1980&#13;
through 1982.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

REPORT    QATP091978&#13;
REPORT    ALLHO11980&#13;
REPORT    GLBALL198019811982&#13;
Note that if several REPORT cards are used and the same report&#13;
is selected on more than one of them, it will only be printed once.&#13;
2. The LGROUP Card&#13;
The LGROUP card is used to assign a name to a group of localities.&#13;
The name can then be used on a REPORT card to specify all the localities in&#13;
the group. The card has this format:&#13;
Columns               Contents&#13;
1-6                  LGROUP&#13;
8-10                  group identifier&#13;
11-13                   locality identifier 1&#13;
14-16                  locality identifier 2&#13;
The group identifier in columns 8-10 may be any combination of characters&#13;
other than ALL, GLB, or the identifier of a locality. The locality identifiers&#13;
in the group are entered in successive 3-column fields beginning in column 11.&#13;
Following is a sample LGROUP card together with a REPORT card which&#13;
refers to the locality group. The REPORT card selects the printing of report&#13;
M02 for localities QAT, SUD, and EGP for 1990.&#13;

Note that the LGROUP card on which the locality group is defined&#13;
must appear before any REPORT cards which refer to the group. The same restriction&#13;
applies to the other group cards decribed in the next two sections.&#13;
3. The RGROUP Card&#13;
The RGROUP card is used to assign a name to a group of reports.&#13;
This name can then be used on a REPORT card to specify all the reports in the&#13;
group. The card has this format:&#13;
Columns                  Contents&#13;
1-6                     RGROUP&#13;
8-10                    group identifier&#13;
11-13                    report identifier 1&#13;
14-16                    report identifier 2&#13;
The group identifier in columns 8-10 may be anycombination of characters other&#13;
than ALL or a legitimate report identifier such as P06. The report identifiers in&#13;
the group are entered in successive 3-column field beginning in column 11.&#13;
Following is a sample RGROUP card together with a REPORT card which&#13;
refers to the report group. The REPORT card selects the printing of reports&#13;
NOl, N06, P03, and P07 for locality QAT in 1977.&#13;
Column 1&#13;
RGROUP RGANOlNO6PO3PO7&#13;

4. The YGROUP Card&#13;
The YGROUP card is used to assign a name to a group of years. The&#13;
name can then be used on a REPORT card to specify all the years in the group.&#13;
The card has this format:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;
Columns                       Contents&#13;

15-18                         year 2&#13;
The group identifier in columns 7-10 may be any combination of characters&#13;
other than the simulation base year or a simulation year. The years in the&#13;
group are entered in successive 4-column fields beginning in column 11.&#13;
Following is a sample YGROUP card together with a REPORT card which&#13;
refers to the year group. The REPORT card selects the printing of report&#13;
H01 for all localities for years 1977 through 1980.&#13;
column 1&#13;
YGR0UPPERA1977197819791980&#13;
REPORT    ALLHO1PERA&#13;
5. The GO Card&#13;
The GO card is used to specify that reports are to be printed, if&#13;
possible, even if one or more errors are detected in the report selection&#13;
control cards. The GO card can appear anywhere in the report selection control&#13;
cards. The card has this format:&#13;
Columns                    Contents&#13;
olumn 1&#13;
1-6                       GO&#13;
If a GO card is not found and errors are detected in the report selection&#13;
control cards the run is terminated without printing any reports.&#13;

APPENDIX E&#13;
Simulation Description&#13;
This appendix contains a description of&#13;
the simulation method.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
Simulation Description&#13;
Each year is simulated by a sequence of computations reflecting&#13;
various occurences, such as attrition, educational advancement, labor&#13;
importation, and others. Most of the computations can be performed&#13;
independently for each locality, but a few require interaction between&#13;
localities, including for example labor importation and return home of&#13;
laborers after attrition.&#13;
For each locality, the attrition of workers from the labor force&#13;
is computed based upon attrition rates entered on L02 and L04 cards. Attrition&#13;
of local nationals results in their permanent withdrawal from the labor force.&#13;
Attrition of non-nationals (expatriates) results in their return to their home&#13;
localities where they must remain for at least one year.&#13;
For each locality, the leakage of nationals from the local labor force&#13;
is computed based upon leakage rates entered on L05 cards. Nationals who leak&#13;
out of the labor force are pooled based upon the pool levels associated with&#13;
the sector/occupation combinations from which they leak. The pooled laborers&#13;
are then subjected to a zero to 3 year wait, based on the figures entered&#13;
on the P04 cards, before entering the type 1 subpools and becoming available&#13;
for reallocation into the local labor force, or in some cases exportation to&#13;
other localities.&#13;
In each locality the educational system is simulated using the ESM&#13;
Model and several categories of school leavers are produced. Underage school&#13;
leavers, whose numbers are determined by the rates entered on the S09 cards, are&#13;
pooled according to skill levels determined by S06 card entries and are placed&#13;
in the type 1 subpools for immediate allocation into the local labor force. The&#13;
numbers of graduates and dropouts are multiplied by the course-specific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 143 -&#13;
participation percentages entered on S05 cards and those who survive&#13;
this "filter" are pooled according to skill levels determined on S06&#13;
cards. These pooled graduates and dropouts are divided according to&#13;
the leakage rates entered on Sll cards. Those who "leak" are put into&#13;
type 2 subpools and may be subject to exportation to other localities (if&#13;
this locality is an exporter at this pool level), while those who do not&#13;
"leak" are placed into type 1 subpools and are available for immediate&#13;
allocation in the local labor force only.&#13;
The sector/occupation cell-specific labor requirements are determined&#13;
from data entered on the D cards. These requirements are compared with the&#13;
existing labor force, after losses from attrition and leakage, to determine&#13;
additional labor requirements in each cell.&#13;
In each locality pools of unallocated nationals are formed. Each&#13;
such pool is divided into two subpools. Subpool type 1 contains nationals&#13;
who are available for immediate allocation into the local labor force and nowhere&#13;
else. As described above, this includes the underage school leavers and non-&#13;
leaked graduates and dropouts from the local educational system, as well as&#13;
returning nationals who have dropped out of another locality's labor force&#13;
(attrition). In addition, the user may use S10 cards to enter or remove&#13;
arbitrary numbers of laborers from tye type 1 subpools. Subpool type 2 contains&#13;
all other non-allocated nationals available for immediate work. This includes,&#13;
as described above, nationals who have leaked from the local labor force and gone&#13;
through the zero to three year time filter, leaked graduates and dropouts from the&#13;
local school system, and any surplus type 1 or Type 2 subpool members who were&#13;
not allocated in the prior simulation year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -&#13;
Type 1 subpool membere are never uDuject Lo exportation. Type 2&#13;
subpool members are subject to exportation only if the pool level is one&#13;
for which the pool's locality is designated to be an exporting locality at&#13;
some allocation level.&#13;
For each locality, the simulation immediately allocates type 1&#13;
subpools into the labor force. Before type 2 subpools can be allocated, the&#13;
degree of exportation must be determined.&#13;
For each pool level, the migration determination requires examination&#13;
of all localities together. For each allocation level within a given pool&#13;
level, the importing localities designated on the M03 card ase determined and&#13;
allocation of their type 2 subpools is computed. (Note that by this point&#13;
these subpools are no longer subject to additional exportation.) After this&#13;
allocation is completed, the remaining needs for expatriates for these importing&#13;
localities at this pool level is computed by examining each sector/occupation&#13;
cell corresponding to this pool level. Within each su1ch "competing" cell,&#13;
an initial estimate of the numbers of the various expatriates to be imported&#13;
is determined such that after importation the expatriate percentages best&#13;
correspond to the target fractions entered on the P10 card(s) for the cell.&#13;
Importation is allowed only from localities designated as suppliers (exporters)&#13;
at the appropriate pool/allocation level combination on the user's M03 data&#13;
card(s). These initial import estimates are summed by nationality across all&#13;
competing cells and each sum is compared to the size of the pool of workers&#13;
available for export in the corresponding supplier locality. If any of these&#13;
export pools is inadequate to meet the combined import demand, the import&#13;
estimates for corresponding suppliers are reduced on a prorata basis in all&#13;
competing cells as necessary to assure no overdraw of supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -&#13;
Since M03 and supply limitations may prevent adequate importation&#13;
to fulfill the labor requirements of all the competing cells, a mechanism&#13;
for computing additional worker migration is provided. For those competing&#13;
cells which have still unfulfilled requirements after initial importation,&#13;
an attempt is made to import additional workers from regional supplier&#13;
localities with excess supply. All competing cells have equal priority in&#13;
drawing upon these excess supplies and within each cell additional supplier&#13;
expatriates will be imported subject to the overage limits entered on the P14&#13;
card(s). These secondary import figures will be prorated across competing&#13;
cells to prevent overdraw of supplies and prorated across competing cells to&#13;
prevent overdraw of supplies and prorated within cells to best maintain the&#13;
relative expatriate representation designated on the P14 card(s).&#13;
After all excess regional supplies have been allocated to the maximum&#13;
extent possible within the limitations of the P14 overage figures, workers&#13;
from M03 designated non-regional supplier localities will be imported to&#13;
fulfill remaining worker requirements in the competing cells. These workers&#13;
will be imported subject to their corresponding P14 overage limits and again&#13;
the relative ratios from the P14 cards will be maintained to the best extent&#13;
possible. No prorating across competing cells is necessary, however, since&#13;
non-regional supplies are presumed to be unlimited.&#13;
Finally, any remaining unfulfilled requirements within competing&#13;
cells will be filled by. importation of workers from the last non-regional&#13;
nationality (generally the true "rest-of-the-world"), without reference to any&#13;
target or overage figures or the M03 importation pattern.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
Once the import pattern is determined for a given allocation&#13;
level, migration is simulated to accomplish the desired importation. This&#13;
means that the importing cells are allocated their determined workers imports&#13;
and the type 2 subpools of exporting localities are reduced by the amount of&#13;
exportation. The computational technique assures that type 2 subpools have&#13;
sufficient laborers to satisfy the exportation.&#13;
Note that every locality should appear as an importing locality at&#13;
some allocation level for each pool level, so that the simulation can determine&#13;
which nationalities, including rest-of-world nationalities, will be used to&#13;
fill expatriate requirements. Localities that never appear as importers will&#13;
have only true rest-of-world expatriates imported to fill any shortages.&#13;
Population aging is simulated for each locality in addition to the&#13;
labor force computations and population figures are adjusted to reflect the&#13;
movement of laborers and their dependents from locality to locality. The&#13;
numbers moving are based upon the rates entered on the P09 cards.&#13;
As an aid in analysis, shortages or surpluses of national laborers&#13;
(based on full nationalization of the labor force) is computed for each pool&#13;
level in each locality. The numbers of workers in transition state who&#13;
could have been allocated if ready to work is also computed as is the additional&#13;
achievable output which those laborers could have produced.&#13;

2. iledium growth rates, medium productivity gains, etc. through 9.&#13;
4. Sector Regrouping (through the G10 Card)&#13;
This regrouping is optional and will probably not be used in the&#13;
initial round of analyses since all eight sectors will be required in the Highlights&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Migration Model is one of a set of
            simulation models developed during a research project to
            study the implications of the explosion of international
            migration in the Middle East and North Africa Region for
            both labor-importing and labor-exporting countries. The
            models have been applied to study manpower problems and
            planning issues in several countries and were proven to be a
            useful tool. This user's guide describes the input,
            output, use, and operation of the model, which is a manpower
            forecasting model, implemented for IBM 370 systems.
