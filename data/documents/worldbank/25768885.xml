Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit&#13;
Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate&#13;

responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;

reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would&#13;

external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an&#13;
