 Centurion University of Technology and Management (CUTM): An example of blending education with skills&#13;
 development in Odisha&#13;
 CUTM is a unique private State University in Odisha. The institute is focused towards imparting appropriate and&#13;
 relevant education. Their objective is to broaden the definition of University to include skills development. Even in&#13;
 research, the focus is more on action research projects.&#13;
 The University is trying to implement a faculty led governance system. This implies faculty led admissions, research&#13;
 and other reforms. Faculty councils to deliberate and decide on courses, grading pattern and blending of skills&#13;
 component are held every month.Â Faculty development programs are conducted regularly every weekend. Also,&#13;
 domain knowledge trainings are held such as courses on New Age Teaching on innovations in teaching methods.&#13;
 The focus is on practice- oriented pedagogy.&#13;
 The autonomy of the institution allows it to be market oriented and develop a skill-based curriculum which is&#13;
 a new and worthwhile approach for creating relevant knowledge base and preparing students for employment.&#13;
 Curriculum is revised every 3-4 years. Faculty, students and alumni are involved in this process. The University has&#13;
 also developed online course content and makes MOOC courses available to students.&#13;
 Besides general courses, the University runs various short term skill development courses through its social outreach&#13;
 entity, Gram Tarang, and also runs Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). Students undergoing these courses also have&#13;
 the facility of taking the Board examination for XIth and XIIth standards from CUTM which has a tie-up with National&#13;
 Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) of Government of India, for this purpose. The students of certificate, diploma&#13;
 and degree courses share the same hostels and frequently work jointly in the workshops. This inculcates a spirit of&#13;
 inclusion among the two groups which are very different socially and economically.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The rise of the global economy, where
            social and economic development are driven by knowledge
            coupled with the information and technology revolution,
            signifies that tertiary education everywhere cannot continue
            with business as usual. The hope is that by creating,
            applying and disseminating new ideas and technologies to
            greater numbers, higher education systems will graduate a
            skilled, flexible and productive work force. The scope of
            the study includes primarily the governance and management
            system across the Higher Education (HE) sector in Odisha;
            the current Quality Assurance System (QAS) including
            affiliation and accreditation and the inter-relationship
            between QAS and HE governance system; issues associated with
            autonomy in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Odisha;
            the existing policy and legal environment in view of
            systemic transformation of governance for excellence; and
            international experience of good practices of governance and
            management system focusing on quality assurance. This paper
            aims: to describe and analyze the state of governance in
            Odisha higher education with special focus on the role of
            the higher education department of the Government of Odisha,
            university management, college management and the
            relationship between these structures; to analyze and
            re-examine the concept of increased autonomy for HEIs in
            Odisha; and to make recommendations on how to improve
            efficiency, effectiveness and accountability for increased
            autonomy in higher education governance.
