                        Chaufournier, Roger A.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted Professor Robert W. Oliver, on 1986-07-22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Chaufournier briefly talks of his background prior to joining the&#13;
Bank in 1952 at the invitation of then-director of the Economics&#13;
Staff, Leonard Rist. This was at the time of the Bank's first major&#13;
reorganization and he was recruited instead as a country economist in&#13;
the newly-created Department of Operations, Western Hemisphere, under&#13;
the directorship of Burke Knapp.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Chaufournier talks of the Bank as a project lender at that time&#13;
and of the great influence economic work had as a foundation for&#13;
judgment on member countries, the survey missions and economic surveys&#13;
done once every three years on a country, the tenuous connection&#13;
between economic work and lending decisions, the Bank's gradual move&#13;
towards providing extensive technical assistance leading to him&#13;
serving initially as adviser and then as Resident Representative in&#13;
Peru for four years. He elaborates on the relationship and eventual&#13;
integration of economic and operational work and the foundation laid&#13;
in the late fifties and early sixties towards the later development of&#13;
country economic work. Launching the Alliance for Progress between the&#13;
U.S. and Latin America in 1961, and its effect on economic development&#13;
in that region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Chaufournier talks of George Woods' achievements as President in&#13;
giving great impetus to the development of aid coordination with other&#13;
UN agencies as well as closer coordination and cooperation with the&#13;
Fund. Bringing Irving Friedman from the Fund as his economic adviser&#13;
and, placing greater emphasis on economic analysis leading to&#13;
reconstituting the Economic Committee which, along with the Loan&#13;
&amp;#12;Committee, forced greater integration of economic and operational&#13;
work. Wood's emphasis on performance on a broader range of economic&#13;
issues, the formulation and establishment of the first official&#13;
consultative group under the aegis of the Bank for Colombia around&#13;
1963, and the difference between the workings of a consortium and a&#13;
consultative group. Jerry Alter's contribution as director of the&#13;
Western Hemisphere Department in the late fifties--with him as deputy-&#13;
-to the improvement of the general quality of economic work;&#13;
emphasizing economic performance, strengthening economic analysis, and&#13;
integrating economic and operational work. In 1968, Chaufournier&#13;
became director of the newly created Western Africa Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Chaufournier continues to elaborate on the personality of George&#13;
Woods in his ability to recognize ideas, his strong instinct for&#13;
development, and his global vision. His major contribution in paving&#13;
the way for what Bob McNamara was able to do later in terms of&#13;
broadening activities for a much fuller service Bank for development&#13;
to include agriculture and education. The Bank's first launch into&#13;
financing education, greater depth in handling debt and the debt&#13;
crisis at that time, the evolution of economic work into country and&#13;
general economic work, and the integration of both operational and&#13;
economic work. The roles of the Economic Committee and Loan Committee&#13;
with its influence on future proposals, and the substantial increase&#13;
in general economics staff. Chaufournier offers his view on the Bank's&#13;
extraordinary position in having access to information and knowledge&#13;
on a comparative basis, the tendency towards esoteric analysis in&#13;
research leading to setting up a Research Committee to rethink the&#13;
direction of research in the Bank, and emphasizes the need for early&#13;
guidance on strategy in achieving development objectives as a very&#13;
critical element of operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Chaufournier talks of the IDA Replenishments as one of George&#13;
Woods' preoccupations and eventual disappointment in not being able to&#13;
obtain more, the reason for instituting the Grand Assize, and setting&#13;
up the committee to review IDA policies headed by Benjamin B. King;&#13;
&amp;#12;George Woods' genuine concern for the poorest countries and the many&#13;
initiatives in Africa. According to Chaufournier, even though the&#13;
expansion of lending to Africa took place under McNamara, this was&#13;
made possible because George Woods recognized the importance of&#13;
agriculture and education in Africa, hence establishing two regional&#13;
missions around '65 or '66, one in West Africa in Abidjan and one in&#13;
East Africa in Nairobi. Chaufournier discusses Woods' inability to&#13;
establish a good rapport with the African countries as he was tough on&#13;
performance; the introduction of the market rate of interest and&#13;
Chaufournier's input in preparing the first draft of that policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Chaufournier addresses the many reasons for the Bank's&#13;
frustrations in its early association with Africa starting in late '68&#13;
and, his conviction of the need for a reorganization which eventually&#13;
took place in '72 thereby changing the situation. Chaufournier talks&#13;
of organizing the first mission for agriculture to Africa in '68&#13;
headed by John de Wilde, taking along a sociologist for the first time&#13;
recommending that one listen and look at local initiative, and his&#13;
regret at the Bank's inability to bridge the gap between its work and&#13;
that of the NGOs. Chaufournier recalls the years in Africa as the&#13;
happiest of his professional career, while the years in the Middle&#13;
East as extremely interesting and challenging, as he proceeds to give&#13;
a comparative elaboration on the reasons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Chaufournier concludes with an assessment of the three presidents&#13;
he served under: Eugene Black, George Woods, and Robert McNamara.&#13;
Talks of the lessons learnt on the importance of communicating with&#13;
one's staff, how ideas develop in the Bank, and the interesting task&#13;
he inherited to look into low staff morale during McNamara's time.&#13;
And, on a personal note, he adds: "Personally, I've found what&#13;
professionally, intellectually and emotionally I wanted to do: to be&#13;
of service for a cause in which I believe, which is important, and&#13;
done it with a kind of professional independence which is unmatched,&#13;
without the servitude and the restrictions that you have in political&#13;
life."&#13;

            Roger A. Chaufournier held on July 22, 1986

        <abstracts>
            In July 1986, Roger A. Chaufournier was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1952-1984, Mr. Chaufournier worked in the
            following areas: in the department of operations as an
            economist for the western hemisphere (1952-1956), as a
            senior loan officer (1960-1963), and as deputy director
            (1964-1968); in Peru as a resident representative of
            resident mission (1956-1957); in the department of
            operations, Europe, as a senior loan officer (1963-1964); in
            the western Africa department as director (1968-1972) and as
            vice president (1972-1977); and in the Europe, Middle East
            and North Africa region as vice president (1977-1984). While
            at the World Bank, his economic work laid a foundation for
            judgment on member countries, influenced the mission and
            economic surveys done once every three years, and correlated
            with lending decisions and the provisions by the World Bank
            for technical assistance to member countries. His transcript
            concerns the relationship of economic and operational work,
            the alliance for progress between the United States and
            Latin America in 1961, the International Development
            Association (IDA), and the reasons for the frustrations in
            the early association of the World Bank with Africa.
