This working paper forms part of the activities of the Africa Transport Policy Pro-&#13;
gram to advocate the adoption of good policies and practices in rural transport in&#13;
Africa. It is intended to fill identified knowledge gaps on rural transport monitor-&#13;
ing and evaluation that is key for impact evaluation of rural transportâ&#128;&#153;s contribu-&#13;
tion to poverty reduction and growth in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
The paper draws on the Authorâ&#128;&#153;s many years of experience working with present&#13;
and former colleagues at I.T.Transport Ltd in United Kingdom. Similarly, the con-&#13;
tribution of M. Mohammed Bejrhit, from the Directorate of Roads, Ministry of&#13;
Equipment and Transport in Morocco, and M. Abdennebi Rmili to the Moroccan&#13;
case study is appreciated. Equally, the warm welcome and support afforded by&#13;
Haileyesus Adamtei from the World Bank Country Office in Addis Ababa, and&#13;
Bekele Negussie in Ethiopia Roads Authority (ERA) is well recognized. I am also&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is a lack of evidence on both the development impacts of rural transport&#13;
improvements and their benefits to the poor. This knowledge gap stems from the&#13;
methodological weaknesses of existing SSA impact studies and the failure to un-&#13;
dertake robust baseline data collection before the launching of a rural transport&#13;
project. This failure is compounded by poor sample design and analysis of collect-&#13;
ed data. Impact studies tend also to be traffic focused and assume that resultant&#13;
transport services are affordable and appropriate to the poor.&#13;
&#13;
In project terms, impact evaluations are the final stage of the M&amp;E process, pre-&#13;
ceded by and to some extent drawing on the results monitoring of the rural&#13;
transport project outcomes. Impact evaluation is therefore a post project activity&#13;
used to assess whether the investment has achieved its development goal.&#13;
&#13;
Most rural transport projects use quantitative techniques to assess impacts, which&#13;
belong to five main types. The first two are macro and sector studies, using sec-&#13;
ondary data to test existing theories and hypotheses on the relationship between&#13;
rural transport and the development process, and predict the likely poverty reduc-&#13;
ing impact of a rural transport investment policy.&#13;
&#13;
The next three are used to evaluate specific projects. They range from cross sec-&#13;
tional studies to panel surveys with the latter emerging as the more robust and&#13;
methodologically sound approach. This is particularly the case if a Randomized&#13;
Control Trial (RCT) sampling of household respondents is adopted and propensi-&#13;
ty score matching is applied to identify comparable treatment and non-treatment&#13;
groups as the basis for the counterfactualâ&#128;&#148;what would have happened without&#13;
the intervention. These have been called the â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; impact methodolo-&#13;
gies but rural transport projects may not be large enough to warrant the technical&#13;
and financial resources needed to collect and analyze the large quantities of impact&#13;
data required by such an evaluation. This emphasis on increasingly sophisticated&#13;
quantitative techniques has meant that qualitative techniques are usually used to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 xiii&#13;
&amp;#12;Rural Transport in Africa â&#128;&#147; Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
triangulate or crosscheck the econometric findings. Rarely are they used as a&#13;
stand-alone evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
All of these techniques use a range of indicators to measure direct and indirect&#13;
effects and impacts. One indicator though missing from this list is the Rural Access&#13;
Indicator (RAI), the defined percentage of population living within 2 kilometers&#13;
(20-25 minutesâ&#128;&#153; walk) of an all-weather road. This type of data is usually collected&#13;
and developed at the macro level but there are notable inconsistencies in the way it&#13;
is measured between different SSATP member countries. These inconsistencies&#13;
need to be addressed if the RAI is to remain as a high-level access indicator capable&#13;
of generalization within and between countries.&#13;
&#13;
The experiences of impact studies carried out by two SSATP country members&#13;
have been reviewed and this has identified a number of key principles that should&#13;
be followed before a RT project commits to undertake an impact study:&#13;
&#13;
1.    There has to be a strong government and sector interest and commitment to&#13;
      undertake a robust impact evaluation. The financial and capacity needs of this&#13;
      commitment lie beyond the scope of most SSA countries and it is expected&#13;
      that development partnersâ&#128;&#153; support will be needed to address this shortfall.&#13;
&#13;
2.    Ideally, the impact study should be also aligned with government systems and&#13;
      be part of a capacity building exercise to carry out evaluations as part of the&#13;
      normal administrative, sector and governance functions that asks â&#128;&#156;what&#13;
      works, and for whomâ&#128;&#157; This widens to impact evaluation to include country&#13;
      statistics offices (CSOs) and where appropriate university staff/research insti-&#13;
      tutions. It should be possible to draw expertise from these organizations and&#13;
      put together a team of national researchers, supported by one or more inter-&#13;
      national experts who have experience of conducting robust road impact eval-&#13;
      uations outside SSA.&#13;
&#13;
3.    The scope of the evaluation has to be clearly defined by the client (public au-&#13;
      thorities). It should answer one or more of the following questions:&#13;
&#13;
        -    Is the intervention making a difference â&#128;&#147; What has happened because&#13;
             of the intervention?&#13;
        -    What are the results on the ground â&#128;&#147; Has the project delivered its ex-&#13;
             pected benefits?&#13;
        -    These in turn can be addressed by a number of indicators or variables,&#13;
             which can be collected by both quantitative and qualitative techniques,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
xiv&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           as a baseline before the project has initiated any works and at various&#13;
           stages after the works have been completed.&#13;
       -   The cost of impact studies reflects the scope defined by the client. At its&#13;
           simplest, an evaluation can undertake qualitative user-focused access&#13;
           surveys costing $100/200,000. At the other extreme, â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
           randomized control trials costs can exceed US$1 million in todayâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
           terms. The costs of the latter, and the need for international expertise,&#13;
           make them suitable only where there is significant government and DP&#13;
           commitment to the rural transport sector.&#13;
&#13;
The adopted methodology for an impact evaluation is usually a compromise be-&#13;
tween the information needs of the funding agency/counterpart line ministry and&#13;
the project provision for M&amp;E. Budget constraints usually mean that project man-&#13;
agement focuses on methodologies that quantify project results or outcomes nota-&#13;
bly transport cost savings enjoyed by road users. Thus, many rural transport pro-&#13;
ject logical frameworks specify traffic or access changes as objectively verified indi-&#13;
cators with a supplementary expectation that there will be a similar reduction in&#13;
transport charges. Access indicators associated with attendance and use of mar-&#13;
kets, health centers, schools, etc. might also be included as objectively verified in-&#13;
dicators. These performance or outcome indicators are easy to collect and analyze&#13;
while project management and the subsector ministry alike will readily understand&#13;
the findings and justify the investment in cost benefit terms without any need to&#13;
understand the long-term impact.&#13;
&#13;
This approach has worked where the road network is well trafficked, which is not&#13;
the case for a number of rural transport projects. In this situation, the proponents&#13;
of quantitative techniques have argued that traffic-based evaluations need widen-&#13;
ing to include household and community surveys, which capture the full devel-&#13;
opment impact of RT improvements.&#13;
&#13;
The high cost and resource demands of this more rigorous and defensible impact&#13;
study mean that it is only occasionally used, usually in situations where develop-&#13;
ment partners and clients have a need for impact data to inform their policy and&#13;
program commitments. Most rural transport projects usually adopt a results or&#13;
performance approach to project monitoring. This type of impact evaluation is&#13;
methodologically sound if it stays focused on the direct traffic and transport bene-&#13;
fits of a project. In this way, it provides subsector feedback on the success of its&#13;
planning and appraisal procedures and meets the accountability needs of financing&#13;
agencies and development partners. However, it has a number of weaknesses the&#13;

most important of which is its inability to assess the distribution of benefits in&#13;
poverty terms. Here it is recommended that qualitative PRA techniques in social&#13;
mapping/modeling and wealth/well-being ranking are explored as a means of an-&#13;
swering the question of who benefits from rural transport interventions.&#13;

&amp;#12;1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This publication is part of a series aimed at promoting good policies and practices on&#13;
rural transport in Africa. A recent review of the status of Rural Transport Knowledge&#13;
Products and Practice (Riverson, 2012) identified a number of knowledge gaps and&#13;
recommended the production of working papers to address these. One of these gaps&#13;
was the absence of robust tools, including relevant indicators and instruments, to&#13;
measure the impact of rural transport projects on rural growth and poverty reduction.&#13;
This paper addresses this gap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.1 Working definitions and terminology&#13;
&#13;
The focus on impact monitoring appears relatively straightforward but in reality re-&#13;
quires a distinction between effects and impact, terms used interchangeably in the lit-&#13;
erature. Similarly, there is a range of technical terms and definitions applied to Moni-&#13;
toring &amp; Evaluation, presented in Annex 4.&#13;
&#13;
A monitoring &amp; evaluation system is an essential element of planning, design and im-&#13;
plementation of a rural transport project 1 as it serves to assess whether it has achieved&#13;
its objective and its development goal. Figure 1-1 outlines the monitoring hierarchy in&#13;
Logical Framework terms, the dotted line outlining normal project responsibilities&#13;
and impact monitoring identified as a post-project activity.&#13;
&#13;
In this model, performance or results monitoring 2 identifies the immediate or short-&#13;
term direct and indirect effects or outcomes brought about by a rural transport inter-&#13;
vention. In contrast, impacts are the longer-term changes in social and economic well-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
 The term is used in its broadest sense of being a collaborative undertaking, involving research&#13;
or design carefully planned to achieve a particular aim or purpose (Wikipedia).&#13;
2&#13;
 Figure 1.1 equates Performance Monitoring with Results Monitoring to describe each type of&#13;
monitoring (World Bank, GDPRP, FAO, 2012). The figure takes a narrower definition of Pro-&#13;
gress Monitoring as the assessment of implementation efficiency, i.e. comparing actual against&#13;
expected financial and physical progress.&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                              1&#13;

being arising as beneficiaries adjust their travel and transport behavior in response to&#13;
the new opportunities brought about by the intervention. As a rule, effects are associ-&#13;
ated with traffic and transport, whereas impacts arise when these effects are sustained&#13;
over time through maintenance. Ideally, an Impact Evaluation establishes the net ef-&#13;
fects and impact of an RT intervention on specific â&#128;&#156;treatmentâ&#128;&#157; units i.e. households,&#13;
enterprises or locations such as roads and/or communities that have benefitted from a&#13;
project. The evaluation compares these findings with those collected from similar&#13;
units that have not benefitted from the project. These are â&#128;&#156;controlsâ&#128;&#157; or â&#128;&#156;non-&#13;
treatmentâ&#128;&#157; units, which represent the counterfactual i.e. what would have happened if&#13;
the intervention had not occurred (Van De Walle , 2009).&#13;

Impact monitoring tests the projectâ&#128;&#153;s development goal, which is of interest to gov-&#13;
ernment, transport policy makers and financiers since it confirms or affirms their pol-&#13;
icy goals/investment focus on RT as a stimulus to development, economic growth,&#13;
poverty alleviation etc. Impacts are also important to the wider public and civil socie-&#13;
ty, which needs to assure that RT improvements are as inclusive as possible and their&#13;
benefits are not confined to special interest groups and elites.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This literature review suggests that this distinction is not widely recognized, particu-&#13;
larly in the unpublished grey literature. Thus, it appears that many development part-&#13;
nersâ&#128;&#153; evaluations focus on results by assessing project relevance, efficiency, effective-&#13;
ness, impact and sustainability but as such are largely following a performance moni-&#13;
toring agenda and project timeline and focus on effects or outcomes, not on impacts.&#13;
&#13;
In contrast, the published literature tends to recognize this distinction. Thus, the Mil-&#13;
lennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) sees independent evaluations as the most rig-&#13;
orous means of measuring [program] impact and [is] at the heart of MCCâ&#128;&#153;s commitment&#13;
to accountability, learning, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making (p. 1,&#13;
MCC, 2012). Yet, there are few completed independent evaluations on the MCC web-&#13;
site and the majority of their evaluation effort seems focused on performance moni-&#13;
toring. Similarly, the Indian Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s Results-Based Management of its large&#13;
agricultural support program separates outcomes from impact and stresses the im-&#13;
portance of the former as a means of assessing the performance of government de-&#13;
partments such as Public Works and Transport in supporting the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ambi-&#13;
tious agricultural development program (Government of Kerala Memo, 2013).&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;2. Monitoring &amp; Evaluating Rural Transport Improvements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.1 Existing knowledge&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) has been an important feature of rural transport&#13;
projects over the last decades but was concerned with progress and performance mon-&#13;
itoring as a means of reporting to sector ministries, government and development&#13;
partners. Impact assessments, where they have been part of this reporting effort, have&#13;
tended to be of low priority in the management push to mobilize and implement&#13;
physical works. This has affected the resultant validity and reliability of impact as-&#13;
sessment. Generally speaking, project management finds it easier to organize and sup-&#13;
port baseline studies than fund and support follow up surveys. This weakness was&#13;
recognized as early as 1984, when Howe noted in his review of road impact literature&#13;
that not one completed study has been based on the long term monitoring of [project-&#13;
induced] change (p. 80, Howe, 1984).&#13;
&#13;
Since then there has been considerable changes in the level of funding and techniques&#13;
used to evaluate interventions, but there is [still] surprisingly little hard evidence on the&#13;
size and nature of rural road improvement benefits, or their distributional impacts (p. 1,&#13;
Van De Walle , 2008). Van De Walle goes on to say, there has been relatively few rigor-&#13;
ous and credible IEs of rural roads (ibid). This continuing knowledge gap seems to stem&#13;
not from a lack of impact studies but from methodological failings in assessing the&#13;
counterfactual usually over a short and project-dependent timeline when impacts&#13;
need a longer period of time to emerge. Yet as Kingombe indicates, the stimulus of&#13;
rural road investment on cotton production took some seven years to emerge in east-&#13;
ern Zambia (2012). Similarly, Mu and Van De Walle found that the range and availa-&#13;
bility of goods, services, markets and off-farm employment and changes in primary&#13;
school completion rates took some six years to become statistically significant changes&#13;
in Vietnam (2007).&#13;
&#13;
Given these concerns, it is nevertheless possible to identify the likely results chain&#13;
brought about by interventions (Table 2-1). The table highlights the positive 3 relation-&#13;
ships expected from an evaluation; it should be noted that the strength and direction&#13;

              of the relationships is dependent on the national and regional context as well as the&#13;
              dynamics of the local economy. This theory-based approach is ideal for a project-&#13;
              based impact evaluation as it uses existing logical frameworks to map out the causal&#13;
              chain from inputs to outcomes and impact, and tests the underlying assumptions and&#13;
              development expectations behind the project design. It therefore sheds light not only&#13;
              on what works but also why it works (White, 2009) and can be broadened to include&#13;
              access impacts on social capital and networks (Davis, 2003).&#13;

Traffic and transport&#13;
Traffic and transport studies have been the most consistent and widely applied focus&#13;
for impact studies yet in reality, they should be considered to be one of the immediate&#13;
effects or outcomes and as discussed later are at the core of performance monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
Traffic. Traffic analysis examines the levels and mix of all traffic to ascertain if post&#13;
improvement traffic flows are cheaper, faster and safer which is often associated from&#13;
a modal shift from less efficient to more efficient transport vehicles. The first two ben-&#13;
efits assess cost and savings and are often the basis for economic analysis to confirm if&#13;
the project was a sound investment in Net Present Value (NPV) of Economic Internal&#13;
Rate of Return (EIRR) terms and form part of a more comprehensive cost benefit&#13;
analysis 4. These conventional economic models are developed at the appraisal stage&#13;
and are revisited as part of the project results monitoring. Importantly, if the econom-&#13;
ic benefits fail to achieve an acceptable economic rate of return then the improvement&#13;
has been over designed, which equate to a waste of resources or a planning weak-&#13;
nessâ&#128;&#148;a cause for concern for project management and client alike since it may repre-&#13;
sent a planning and design weakness.&#13;
&#13;
Most rural transport projects involve improving roads and tracks, which carry very&#13;
low volumes of traffic. In Zambia, the baseline study for Community Transport Infra-&#13;
structure improvements in five districts reported that an average of 253 pedestrians,&#13;
110 intermediate means of transport (IMT) and 10 motorized vehicles were using the&#13;
proposed community roads on a daily basis (I.T. Transport, 2009). Similarly, the traf-&#13;
fic levels were so low in Ghana that in spite of demonstrable transport cost reductions,&#13;
standard economic analysis suggested that the investments were uneconomic. Thus,&#13;
baseline studies showed that rural roads in the project areas were carrying an average&#13;
of ten motorized vehicles per day, eight of which were motorcycles. This number in-&#13;
creased to twenty-seven motorized vehicles along the project road of which twenty-&#13;
three were motorcycles. This steep increase in motorcycles was mirrored along the&#13;
control roads and reflected the falling costs of purchasing a motorcycle and their&#13;
greater flexibility in traversing unimproved roads.&#13;

costs of the investment; 2) the direct savings in the costs of operating vehicles 3) economies&#13;

savings generated from reductions in road accidents and 6) the wider effects on the economic&#13;

&amp;#12;Rural Transport in Africa â&#128;&#147; Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Transport. While transport is directly affected by savings in vehicle operating costs&#13;
owing to reductions in the roughness brought about by road improvements, the criti-&#13;
cal question in terms of assessing impact is whether these savings are passed on to&#13;
travelers and producers paying for transport services. All too often transport operators&#13;
plying low volume roads face little competition and fail to pass on any post improve-&#13;
ment vehicle cost savings they enjoy. An examination of this tendency in Malawi indi-&#13;
cated that â&#128;&#156;transport costs on poor feeder roads are disproportionately high as operators&#13;
contend with the low volume of goods carried over short distances to local market centers&#13;
and the possibility of empty backhaulsâ&#128;&#157; (p. 2, Lall et al., 2009). A more recent study in&#13;
Ethiopia confirms this relationship. It found that distance from markets was correlat-&#13;
ed with increased transport costs and c concomitant drop in demand for freight of&#13;
more than 1,100 kg per household in accessing communities to just over 500 kg in the&#13;
more remote areas (Stifel et al., 2012).&#13;
&#13;
Alternatively, households on poor roads with few transport services may pay high&#13;
transport costs indirectly by accepting lower prices for their farm produce i.e., by sell-&#13;
ing at the farm gate. (Jacoby and Minton, 2007). This poor access is to some extent&#13;
being overcome by the widespread use of mobile phones. In the Zambian CTI survey,&#13;
mobile phones are used to check market prices and organize the bulk movement of&#13;
produce to markets offering the best prices (I.T. Transport, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
In all of the above cases, the authors highlight the transport cost reductions arising&#13;
from feeder road improvements as a means of increasing agricultural production and&#13;
in the case of Ethiopia as a cost-effective way of reducing poverty (Stifel et al. 2012). In&#13;
contrast, recent research in Malawi suggests that reduced VOCs do not translate to re-&#13;
duced transport prices (especially where [traffic] volumes are low) and reduced transport&#13;
prices do not translate to poverty reduction if the poor cannot afford to use transport ser-&#13;
vices or need other factors to increase production (p.18, Raballand, et al. 2011). These&#13;
contrasting cases illustrate the lack of consistent impact evaluation findings, which in&#13;
turn highlight the importance of the research setting.&#13;
&#13;
Rural economy&#13;
Subsistence and cash crop agriculture is the primary basis of rural economy in Africa.&#13;
The interaction between road infrastructure and this economy is indirect where access&#13;
improvement facilitates the access to agricultural extension services, and the move-&#13;
ment of inputs, marketed surpluses and cash crops. This facilitation role depends on&#13;
the existence of a right of way along which motorized and non-motorized vehicles and&#13;
transport services can operate. Ideally, the right of way should be engineered to pro-&#13;
vide all-weather access although seasonal access before and after the main rains may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
be sufficient for moving bulky inputs and the harvesting and marketing of most crops.&#13;
In either case, the road must be capable of attracting affordable transport services for&#13;
farming households. It must also be maintained so that access benefits are sustained in&#13;
support of agricultural investments like irrigation. Given this relationship, it is reason-&#13;
able to expect that improved access would stimulate agriculture in one or more of the&#13;
following ways.&#13;

    ï&#130;§ Greater use of external markets with a commensurate increase in prices and re-&#13;
      turns. (Cranfield University and I.T. Transport, 2012)&#13;
&#13;
This positive perspective is supported by the AICD (Africa Infrastructure Country&#13;
Diagnostic) study on crop production and road connectivity in SSA which found that&#13;
agricultural production and proximity (as measured by travel time) to urban markets&#13;
are highly correlated, even after taking agro-ecology into account. Likewise, the adop-&#13;
tion of high productive or high-input technology is negatively correlated with travel&#13;
time to urban centers (Dorosh et al., 2009). However, research in Uganda cautions&#13;
that it is not always the case that improving rural transport will generate a positive&#13;
chain of events; it depends upon the â&#128;&#156;assumptions, prices and market conditionsâ&#128;&#157; en-&#13;
countered by the project (p. 4, Raballand et al., 2011). This finding is supported in by&#13;
Gachassin et al. (2010) whose research in Cameroon concluded that better access to&#13;
roads still left agricultural households â&#128;&#156;trapped in povertyâ&#128;&#157; (p. 28, Gachassin et al.,&#13;
2010) as they did not have the necessary endowments (land, skills, labor) to increase&#13;
production and surplus.&#13;
&#13;
One mechanism, which may explain this â&#128;&#156;poverty trapâ&#128;&#157;, is the reduction in price of&#13;
local crops after a road improvement in Sierra Leone. Competition amongst produc-&#13;
ers and reduction in transport costs on the improved roads had the effect of lowering&#13;
market prices of local food crops i.e. supply side effects were more important than&#13;
demand side effects, which would have increased prices. This trend strengthened in&#13;
remoter markets and in less productive areas but weakened where there was good&#13;
mobile phone coverage (Casaburi et al., 2013). The latter has become an important&#13;
marketing tool for farmers producing a surplus in Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In contrast, it is found in Kenya that lowering high transport costs through improve-&#13;
ments in rural infrastructure, especially roads, was not only important for improving&#13;
access to input and output markets, but also indirectly enhance the productivity of&#13;
non-traded crops, which significantly reduce rural poverty and encourage growth (p.&#13;
34, Thurlow et al., 2007).&#13;
&#13;
Finally, there is some evidence that road access can stimulate the diversification of the&#13;
rural economy, which can help rural livelihoods in periods of low cash crop prices or&#13;
crop failure. This tends to be most common where there is a nearby demand for non-&#13;
agricultural services e.g. in the peri-urban areas of Tanzania (Lanjouw, Quizon and&#13;
Sparrow, 2001). Similarly, Smith, Gordon, Meadows and Zwick (2001) suggest that&#13;
road rehabilitation in Uganda stimulated the development of transport related enter-&#13;
prises and extended job opportunities in the service sector. In both cases, access was&#13;
associated with paved roads and as Kim states, given the poor condition of access on&#13;
the unpaved roads in rural Uganda, one can infer that the poor have very restricted&#13;
access to markets and thus diversification opportunities (Kim, 2011).&#13;
&#13;
Education&#13;
It can be assumed that the majority of children in most rural areas walk to primary&#13;
school; the Zambian baseline study indicated that schoolchildren made up to half of&#13;
the pedestrian stream along the community roads (I.T. Transport, 2009). This as-&#13;
sumption is validated by Porter [the vast majority of children in our study â&#128;¦ in all three&#13;
countries (Ghana, Malawi and the Republic of South Africa), walk 5 kilometers or more&#13;
to school] (p. 67, 2011).&#13;
&#13;
The impact of rural transport improvements will therefore be indirectâ&#128;&#148;through in-&#13;
creased provision of primary schools, teachers and educational oversight. Yet many&#13;
studies show this indirect effect is largely reflected by school attendance data and less&#13;
commonly by completion or attainment rates. Thus, a survey of 12,558 children in&#13;
Zambia indicated that access to a passable road increased the probability of school&#13;
attendance by 8.83% and 6.53% for eight year olds and thirteen year olds respectively&#13;
(Nielsen, 1998). Similarly, multiple regression analysis of student data from the Gha-&#13;
naian Living Standards Measurement Survey, showed that the access to a road in a&#13;
village increases the probability of a child from that village of going to a primary&#13;
school by 4.3% for children aged 5-12 and 8.8% for children aged 9-12. (Lavy, 1996,&#13;
quoted in Brenneman and Kerf, 2002). Recent research shows that this effect is often&#13;
stronger for girls than boys since they seem to be more constrained by poor access.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The impact of increased attendance on school completion or attainment is less docu-&#13;
mented in SSA impact evaluation, but Van De Walle and Muâ&#128;&#153;s road impact study in&#13;
Vietnam found a statistically significant, sustained and robust improvement in prima-&#13;
ry school completion rates, up by 15% to 25%. Unfortunately, this data was not dis-&#13;
aggregated into boys and girls.&#13;
&#13;
It has been argued that better qualified teachers are willing to work in areas served by&#13;
roads. The evaluation of Kilombero and Ulanga Road Rehabilitation Program&#13;
(KURRP) in Tanzania, suggested that motivation for teachers assigned to rural school&#13;
increased after road rehabilitation as did pupil attendance levels (Kapsel, 2004).&#13;
&#13;
Improved health&#13;
Rural transport improvements affect both the provision and utilization of health care&#13;
facilities so much so that â&#128;&#156;access to medical facilities frequently emerges as the major&#13;
perceived benefit of new roadsâ&#128;&#157; (p.72, Howe and Richards, 1984,). The importance of&#13;
roads to health access is still evident as social appraisals of rural roads in Uganda&#13;
demonstrate (Odoki, et al., 2006). Similarly, a study of the barriers to the care of HIV-&#13;
infected children in rural Zambia, found that most participants (73%) reported diffi-&#13;
culties accessing the HIV clinic, including insufficient money (60%), lack of transpor-&#13;
tation (54%) and roads in poor condition (32%) (van Dijk et al., 2009).&#13;
&#13;
In impact terms, analysis of clinic records in Ghana indicated that more women used&#13;
the clinics after a road improvement mainly for prenatal and neo natal services. In&#13;
addition, health workers were more inclined to visit communities to train village&#13;
health workers with the improvement of the village access roads (I.T. Transport,&#13;
2005). This finding is echoed in The Gambia where transportation problems contrib-&#13;
uted to peri-natal mortalities (Cham et al, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
However, improving rural transport will not necessarily increase access for the poor,&#13;
for whom health service fees, perceived quality of government health services and&#13;
transport and opportunity costs may still be a barrier to health care (Dowling and&#13;
Sethi, 2001). A study from Kenya (Airey, 1991) showed that, after building a new re-&#13;
gional road, the "better off" increased their use of a district hospital whereas user fees&#13;
and transport costs continued to be constraints for the poor.&#13;
&#13;
A gender perspective on access to health was also explored in Ethiopia, Lesotho and&#13;
Ghana using Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) that are routinely carried out in&#13;
many SSA countries. Analysis of the questions exploring womenâ&#128;&#153;s barriers to access&#13;
suggested that the lack of money for treatment was the most important constraint&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           11&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
affecting 73%, 40% and 57% of women in each country. Distance to the health center&#13;
involved walking and was identified as the second most important barrier to access for&#13;
63%, 29% and 37% of DHS respondents respectively (Walker, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
Individual well-being&#13;
Constrained mobility is often one of the significant challenges women face in access-&#13;
ing markets, schools and health facilities creating a spatial poverty trap for women and&#13;
girls (Porter, 2007). Gender breakdown of the CTI users in Zambia showed a strong&#13;
and statistically significant difference in the use of the different transport modes. Men&#13;
travel almost twice as much as women and use IMTs and vehicles to accomplish half&#13;
of these journeys. In contract, women travel less and most of their journeys are on&#13;
foot (I.T. Transport, ibid). This pattern was also found in Ghana, where six out of ten&#13;
road users were men, who disproportionately dominated the IMT and vehicle modes,&#13;
while women comprised 72% of the pedestrian stream (I.T. Transport, ibid).&#13;
&#13;
This reflects the fact that in most SSA rural communities, transport modes are gener-&#13;
ally controlled by men, limiting the independent mobility of women (Fernando and&#13;
Porter, 2002). Moreover, women often bear a disproportionate transport-related bur-&#13;
den by head loading the fuel, water and food needs of the household (Dawson and&#13;
Barwell, 1993). These time and energy demands put them at a further disadvantage&#13;
when seeking the opportunity to access schools, health services and markets.&#13;
&#13;
Given this context, it is argued that while improved access to transport does not guar-&#13;
antee increased gender equality, it provides transport services that allow women to be&#13;
more mobile and reduce their transport burden. This can empower women by allow-&#13;
ing them to develop other income generating activities and participate more in com-&#13;
munity affairs. Recent research suggests that while women generally appreciate the&#13;
widespread availability of motorcycle taxis, they found it difficult to meet their high&#13;
travel costs and prefer to use conventional transport services (Starkey et al., 2013).&#13;
&#13;
More effective governance&#13;
The transport network is a physical manifestation of the national governmentsâ&#128;&#153; ability&#13;
to exercise political power, deliver services and collect taxes and revenue. In spite of&#13;
recent reforms, most SSA governments are involved in the decision making and plan-&#13;
ning behind the construction and maintenance of roads. This is the case in Ghana,&#13;
where there is some evidence that voters recognize that the ruling parties influence the&#13;
allocation of road sector resources. Thus, during the 2012 national and presidential&#13;
elections, people living along poorly maintained roads displayed slogans like â&#128;&#156;No&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Road No Voteâ&#128;&#157;. Regression analysis of Ghanaian electoral behavior confirms that vot-&#13;
ing is indeed influenced by the condition of local roads i.e. within one kilometer of the&#13;
electoral area and this can be critical in marginal constituencies (Harding, 2013).&#13;
&#13;
In contrast, governments tend to leave the operation of RT services to the private sec-&#13;
tor and try to manage these by varying degrees of regulation, legal enforcement, incen-&#13;
tives and technical support. Thus, road improvements in Morocco have failed to&#13;
stimulate formal transport services along some 60% of its improved roads and unreg-&#13;
ulated transport operators have filled the gap. Starkey and Njenga argue that in this&#13;
situation local authorities and transporters should work together to reduce tariffs,&#13;
improve vehicle quality and service frequency as well as enhance passenger safety. This&#13;
benefits all users, particularly women who may be constrained by poor condition of&#13;
most rural transport (2010).&#13;
&#13;
Possible negative effects and impacts&#13;
Traffic accidents. In spite of the low speeds associated with most pedestrians and cy-&#13;
clists, there is a significant safety risk in rural transport. The increased number of mo-&#13;
torized vehicles that follow road improvement makes the right of way more dangerous&#13;
for those who walk, cycle and use motorcycles (WHO, 2013). Thus, Obeng reports&#13;
that pedestrian accidents account for over forty percent (40%) of all road traffic acci-&#13;
dents in Ghana (2013). Worryingly, SSA is reported to have the highest road traffic&#13;
fatality rates in the world, averaging some 28 deaths per 100,000 people (gTKP, 2013).&#13;
&#13;
This SSA average probably understates the real picture particularly for rural roads&#13;
where only a small proportion of accidents are reported. In Uganda, Kwamusi sug-&#13;
gests that only 7% of all road accidents on rural roads are reported to the police and&#13;
only 20% of accident victims seek medical assistance (2002). This under reporting is&#13;
exacerbated by the informal and unregulated nature of much rural travelâ&#128;&#148;use of ac-&#13;
cident prone bicycle (boda-boda) and motorcycle taxi services (okada). In national&#13;
terms, it is estimated that the direct costs of road accidents exceeds the annual aid&#13;
budget for many SSA countries. In household terms, such fatalities are a severe&#13;
â&#128;&#156;shockâ&#128;&#157; to family budgets since the majority of casualties, 75% in the case of Kenya,&#13;
are economically productive young adults (gTKP, 2013). Thus, road accidents appear&#13;
to be a â&#128;&#156;trigger for povertyâ&#128;&#157; in Bangladesh and Bangalore where funeral costs and the&#13;
loss of income from the accident victim plunged the household into poverty (p.25,&#13;
Aeron-Thomas et. al. 2004).&#13;
&#13;
Environmental concerns. Rural transport interventions have both direct and indirect&#13;
environmental impacts. These begin with the acquisition of productive agricultural&#13;
land and housing for both the right of way as well as borrow pits/quarries for road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           13&#13;

&#13;
                              building material. Road construction practices also expose the workforce and people&#13;
                              living alongside the right of way to a range of hazards ranging from â&#128;&#156;imported diseas-&#13;
                              esâ&#128;&#157; to noise and dust. Finally, the resultant traffic effects may impact on social and&#13;
                              environmental well-being.&#13;

                              Development partners and countries have developed a range of policies, guidelines&#13;
                              and practices, which are designed to identify and mitigate any of these identified con-&#13;
                              cerns. Thus, the African Development Bank (AfDB) has put in place a number of en-&#13;
                              vironmental policies, procedures, and guidelines targeted policies and projects (Puetz,&#13;
                              2013). Other development partners have a similar suite of policy and implementation&#13;
                              instruments. Table 2- outlines the typical environmental concerns designed to address&#13;
                              for a feeder road project in Liberia.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Such a framework will be used to develop an Environmental and Social Impact As-&#13;
sessment (ESIA), which will in turn be addressed by an Environmental Management&#13;
Plan (EMP) to monitor and mitigate the ESIA concerns. In this case, the identification&#13;
team stressed the social advantages of using labor-based methods and steps needed to&#13;
minimize dust from vehicles, erosion of surfaces, and ensure the adequacy of drainage&#13;
structures and outlets.&#13;
&#13;
An evaluation of this development partner-driven ESIA process for AfDB identified a&#13;
number of findings that are relevant to impact evaluations:&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;§ Short-term environmental outcomes of AfDB supported roads were by and&#13;
         large satisfactory&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;§ The quality of long-term environmental road management and maintenance&#13;
         is often deficient, in contrast to short-term effects&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;§ Induced secondary environmental damages from road constructionâ&#128;&#148;such as&#13;
         deforestation, unplanned land settlements and loss of bio-diversityâ&#128;&#148;are&#13;
         rarely mitigated through project and sector interventions.&#13;
&#13;
Climate shocks likely to affect SSA are associated with the frequency and intensifica-&#13;
tion of weather events and over time a shift in key climatic and environmental bound-&#13;
aries e.g. the intensity and length of the rainy season. It is argued that improved access&#13;
to markets linked to an adaptive agricultural policy and more resilient engineering of&#13;
rural infrastructure can help rural households adapt to these shocks (Baez et al. 2013).&#13;
&#13;
Migration. Roads play an ambivalent role in the migration process. There is a long&#13;
established belief that roads stimulate rural-urban migration by a two way process of&#13;
increasing the flow of urban information and values while reducing the cost of travel&#13;
for a would-be migrant (Connell, 1976). In contrast, where rural transport interven-&#13;
tions are opening up previously inaccessible areas, land hungry farmers and investors&#13;
may move in order to exploit the underutilized land (Jacoby and Minten, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2 Impact evaluation methodologies&#13;
&#13;
Impact evaluation methodologies in the transport sector have been largely driven by&#13;
an economic agenda, which has favored quantitative techniques. Five types of quanti-&#13;
tative methodologies (Table 2-) have been applied to the evaluation of rural transport&#13;
projects or programs and policy interventions. The first two, macro and sector studies&#13;
are more commonly used to assess national and international road investment poli-&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                           15&#13;

&#13;
cies, while the last three, cross-sectional, longitudinal and panel studies, are likely to&#13;
be applied to project and program M&amp;E. These quantitative techniques are discussed&#13;
first, before qualitative techniques are introduced as an overlapping and supporting&#13;
methodology to what might seem to be an over reliance on quantitative approaches by&#13;
the transport sector.&#13;

Macro and sector studies&#13;
Both techniques tend to use secondary data to test existing theories and hypothe-&#13;
ses on the relationship between rural transport and the development process and&#13;
predict for example the likely poverty reducing impact of an investment policy.&#13;
These techniques tend to use multiple regression analysis or allied econometric&#13;
techniques to estimate the relationships between variables, as measured by indica-&#13;
tors. The aim of these techniques is to establish a statistical relationship or elastici-&#13;
ties between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The&#13;
direction and causation of these relationships may not be explored and their reso-&#13;
lution is such that they fail to pick up small-scale changes at the community and&#13;
household level. As a result, these studies are mainly used at the policy level to ad-&#13;

&#13;
vocate or justify national and/or international investment in the transport sector&#13;
and do not lend themselves to project level impact evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
In the case of macro studies, the scale of study tends to be international and the&#13;
dependent variables are reliant on international and national data sets e.g. a pov-&#13;
erty indicator and road network length or density. The age and accuracy of this&#13;
data may be less than reliable and steps may be taken to adjust for this.&#13;
&#13;
In either case, a wide range of independent (explanatory) variables are used to&#13;
understand and even quantify how the typical value of a dependent variable&#13;
changes when any one of the independent variables is varied. Thus, the macro&#13;
study of the impact of transport investment on poverty reduction in SSA by&#13;
Seetanah (2012) uses a basic economic model with an independent variable POV&#13;
representing the number of people below the poverty line, and several explanatory&#13;
variables including GDP per capita. The data were all obtained from international-&#13;
ly published data, notably the World Development Report, which was cross-&#13;
checked or adjusted with data from individual Country Statistical Office (CSO)&#13;
reports, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Road Fed-&#13;
eration (IRF).&#13;
&#13;
Alternatively, Stoneyardâ&#128;&#153;s macro research adopts a regression analysis to model the&#13;
relationship between transport costs, urban growth and inter-urban trade in SSA.&#13;
To overcome the lack of secondary data, satellite imagery of the light generated by&#13;
cities; geo-referenced road data by road surface type and generalized road&#13;
transport costs were used to model the effect of oil price shocks on the flow of&#13;
trade between coastal primate cities and other cities in the urban hierarchy. The&#13;
analysis provides evidence that transport costs impact urban economic activity in&#13;
SSA by making access to critical cities more expensive (p. 23, Stoneyard, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
In contrast, the macro study of crop production and road connectivity (Dorosh et&#13;
al., 2009) used crop production data, agronomic potential, population of local&#13;
markets and road connectivity, as measured by estimated travel time to the nearest&#13;
market. This data was analyzed for 42 SSA countries using the International Fund&#13;
for Agricultural Developmentâ&#128;&#153;s (IFPRI) Spatial Production Allocation Model&#13;
(SPAM). The use of GIS makes it possible to undertake subnational analysis but&#13;
the lack of detailed household and subnational data preclude analysis of the im-&#13;
pacts of transport infrastructure on agriculture for most of African countries (p. 1,&#13;
ibid). IFPRI have also developed a conceptual framework and Multiple Regression&#13;
Analysis (MRA) modeling approach to throw light on the factors that influence&#13;

household poverty in Asia (Fan et al 2000, 2002 and 2004) and have adapted this&#13;
to some African countries.&#13;
&#13;
Sector studies are not common in SSA and usually rely on subnational data sets&#13;
collected by Country Statistical Offices (CSO) or as part of a research project. They&#13;
often use time-series data to develop a statistical relationship between poverty re-&#13;
duction, investment in different sectors and other variables. Thus, Dercon et al.&#13;
(2005 and 2008) reported on a longitudinal study on changes in access to roads&#13;
and agricultural extension services in Ethiopia, from 1994 to 2004. The study ex-&#13;
amined the relationship between household consumption of own grown, pur-&#13;
chased food and non-food items with a number of road dependent benefit chan-&#13;
nels like the costs of acquiring inputs, output prices, household consumption,&#13;
rainfall and price shocks. Their conclusion was that access to good roads increased&#13;
consumption growth by 16.3% and reduced poverty by 6.9%. This was a statisti-&#13;
cally significant relationship and reflected the role of good roads in facilitating&#13;
access to local market towns that in turn are linked to larger urban centers.&#13;
&#13;
Gachassin used econometric techniques to analyze the second National Household&#13;
Survey (ECAM II) in Cameroon. Access to roads was measured through two ques-&#13;
tions in the survey. Households were asked how far (in kilometers) they were from&#13;
the nearest paved road and how much time (in minutes) was needed to reach it. In&#13;
its analysis, the team used the time rather than distance variable since it was re-&#13;
garded as a more precise measure of accessibility. The results throw doubt on the&#13;
belief that road access automatically leads to poverty reduction by stimulating in-&#13;
creased agricultural production and marketing. They concluded that the non-&#13;
agricultural opportunities opened up by roads were much more important in re-&#13;
ducing poverty.&#13;
&#13;
Cross sectional, longitudinal and panel studies&#13;
Introduction. These types of impact studies have tended to be applied to the eval-&#13;
uation of rural transport projects and pose major empirical challenges since â&#128;&#152;natu-&#13;
ralâ&#128;&#153; experiments involving large and permanent changes in transport costs are rare,&#13;
if non-existent (Jacoby and Minten, 2008). This constraint explains the widespread&#13;
use of quasi-experimental designs beginning with simple with-without/cross sec-&#13;
tional and longitudinal evaluations culminating in the â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; statistically&#13;
sophisticated and complex longitudinal randomized control trial (RCT) panel&#13;
survey. These studies largely collect their own primary data for analysis although&#13;
some of the project relies on secondary data to varying degrees.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conventionally, impact studies have adopted a â&#128;&#156;quasi-experimental designâ&#128;&#157; to&#13;
undertake a cross sectional comparison of randomly selected communities and&#13;
households, as a baseline study or benchmark. This is followed up several years&#13;
after the project has finished with a before/after, with/without comparative survey.&#13;
The rigor of the analysis associated with this follow-up survey is used to identify&#13;
two types of impact study (longitudinal and panel studies). The first is a simple&#13;
approach that uses descriptive statistics to explain differences between the cells.&#13;
The second is a much more complex approach that uses statistical techniques, no-&#13;
tably propensity score matching, to identify before and after groupings or â&#128;&#156;panelsâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
of closely matched â&#128;&#156;treatmentâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;controlâ&#128;&#157; households to isolate differences and&#13;
attribute them to the intervention. This approach is considered the â&#128;&#156;gold stand-&#13;
ardâ&#128;&#157; evaluation for RCT quantitative approaches but does not preclude the use of&#13;
other evaluation methodologies.&#13;
&#13;
The next three methodologies all derive their analytical framework from the appli-&#13;
cation of a quasi-experimental design to a project (Table 2-5).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Cross sectional impact studies&#13;
Cross sectional comparisons are the weakest one of the three methodologies. They&#13;
assume that different social groups and the poor in the â&#128;&#156;withâ&#128;&#157; communities will&#13;
enjoy full travel and transport benefits from road access and project improve-&#13;
ments, while the different social groups and the poor in the â&#128;&#156;withoutâ&#128;&#157; communi-&#13;
ties will have no travel and transport benefits from road access or project im-&#13;
provements. Simple cross-sectional studies define the zone of influence of the in-&#13;
tervention and comparative analysis between the with/without cells is used as a&#13;
predictor of likely project effects and impacts in a baseline study. Alternatively,&#13;
such comparison might be applied in a post intervention situation to compensate&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                 21&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
for the absence of baseline data. In this situation, cross-sectional analysis can only&#13;
be used to estimate project effects (Bamberger et al., 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Cross-sectional studies were common in the 1990â&#128;&#153;s when used to quickly highlight&#13;
a policy concern or gap. I.T. Transportâ&#128;&#153;s Village Level Travel and Transport Sur-&#13;
veys (VLTTS) leading up to the publication of â&#128;&#156;Roads are not enoughâ&#128;&#157; (Dawson&#13;
and Barwell, 1993) were based on cross-sectional comparisons between accessible&#13;
and inaccessible communities. They used a mixture of quantitative and qualitative&#13;
techniques to (i) estimate the time and effort spent on transport; (ii) analyze local&#13;
transport as a factor in agricultural development and in the utilization of essential&#13;
services; (iii) understand the role of transport and the impact in womenâ&#128;&#153;s daily&#13;
lives; and (iv) identify the scope for improvement in traditional transport modes&#13;
so as to enhance mobility and accessibility. The VLTTS approach was last used in&#13;
Ethiopia in 1998 to inform its emerging rural transport policy.&#13;
&#13;
The cross-sectional study of the benefits of rural roads on the income of poor&#13;
households in Peru was able to use propensity score matching to overcome endog-&#13;
enous biases (Escobal and Ponce, 2002). They re-analyzed impact survey data for a&#13;
road improvement project and were able to identify a sample of 1,625 â&#128;&#156;treatedâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
and 413 â&#128;&#156;controlâ&#128;&#157; households. This was sufficiently robust to enable them to con-&#13;
struct a counterfactual grouping of untreated households and establish causal wel-&#13;
fare relationships. Their analysis indicated that the most important short-term&#13;
impact was an increase in income particularly from non-agricultural sources. In-&#13;
terestingly, this was not matched by a rise in consumption patterns and house-&#13;
holds increased their livestock holdings as it was assumed that the road improve-&#13;
ments were not likely to be permanent, due to poor maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
Longitudinal (With/Without and Before/After) Impact Studies. Like cross-&#13;
sectional studies, simple longitudinal impact studies have become discredited due&#13;
to their intrinsic weaknesses to control for placement biases and capture defensible&#13;
welfare benefits and impacts. Nevertheless, they are quite commonly used to assess&#13;
project effects, focusing on identifying the traffic and travel changes brought about&#13;
by project interventions and using adjacent control roads to isolate these. A good&#13;
example of this is I.T. Transportâ&#128;&#153;s impact study of Rural Development Project&#13;
(RDP) 6 in Bangladesh (1997).&#13;
More recently, Hettige undertook an in-depth analysis of the impact of roads on&#13;
the rural poor in Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka for the Asian Develop-&#13;
ment Bank (2006). The study had an ambitious agenda of applying double differ-&#13;
ence analysis to quantitative data. However, the absence of useful baseline infor-&#13;
mation and suitable control sites meant that this approach was abandoned and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
team relied on recall techniques to compare before and after conditions. The&#13;
fieldwork effort subsequently focused on traffic outcomes and Participatory Rural&#13;
Assessment (PRA) methodologies to construct a series of case studies with which&#13;
to inform policy and programming.&#13;
&#13;
Before-After combined with With-Without Panel Surveys. Longitudinal studies&#13;
invariably adopt a double difference methodology to make comparisons between the&#13;
four cells in Table 2-5. There are a number of â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; RCT impact studies&#13;
in the development literature but all of them have been outside the SSA region.&#13;
These include (i) the impact assessment of DANIDA support to rural transport&#13;
infrastructure (PAST) in Nicaragua; (ii) the impact assessment of road improve-&#13;
ments in Bangladesh (Khander, Baht, and Koolwal, 2006); (iii) the social impact&#13;
assessment of the Viet Nam Rural Transport Project I (RTP I); (iv) the impact&#13;
assessment of the Southwest China Poverty Reduction Project (a ten-year impact&#13;
study); and (v) the Georgian impact study of Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation.&#13;
All examples show the difficulty of controlling project endogeneity and heteroge-&#13;
neity and the need for sophisticated statistical and econometric techniques to&#13;
overcome this and other difficulties. This improvement in evaluation methodolo-&#13;
gies requires the support of highly qualified specialists and increased resources for&#13;
data collection and analysis. Yet, the findings from this increased effort can seem&#13;
rather disappointing. Thus, the Nicaraguan impact study identifies travel timesav-&#13;
ing as the â&#128;&#156;least surprising and the most important evaluation findingâ&#128;&#157; (op. cit.&#13;
p.13). Confirmation of these savings is both routine and vital since such savings, if&#13;
sustained, are the main driver of the economic and social impacts that follow road&#13;
improvements. The steps for the double difference methodology are as follows.&#13;
&#13;
Table 2-5. How to Do a Double Difference Impact Study&#13;
&#13;
            Undertake a baseline survey before the intervention is in place, and the survey must&#13;
Step 1      cover both non participants (non-beneficiaries) and participants (beneficiaries). If you do&#13;
            not know who will participate, you have to make an informed guess.&#13;
&#13;
            Undertake one or more follow up surveys after the program is put in place. These should&#13;
            be highly comparable to the baseline survey (in terms of the questionnaires, the inter-&#13;
Step 2&#13;
            viewing, etc.). Ideally the follow up surveys should be of the same sample observations&#13;
            as the baseline survey.&#13;
&#13;
            Calculate the mean differences between the after and the before values of the outcome&#13;
Step 3&#13;
            indicators for each of the participant and non-participant groups.&#13;
&#13;
            Calculate the differences between these two means differences [the double difference].&#13;
Step 4&#13;
            That is your estimate of the impact of the program.&#13;

&amp;#12;Rural Transport in Africa â&#128;&#147; Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Currently, simple longitudinal surveys are mainly used to identify and analyze&#13;
project effects, which mean that they mainly focus on traffic and transport. In the&#13;
past, they were much wider ranging and considered not only the direct impact on&#13;
(i) transport infrastructure and services but also the indirect impact on (ii) the&#13;
agricultural economy, (iii) the social sectors such as health and education and (iv)&#13;
the environment. A typical example is the Impact Evaluation Report on the Socio-&#13;
economic Influence of Rural Roads in Morocco (Operations Evaluation Dept.&#13;
1996). It used questionnaire surveys and focus group discussions to compare cur-&#13;
rent conditions (in 1995) with those before the investments and, second, it com-&#13;
pared conditions in the project road relative to a control road, which did not bene-&#13;
fit from improvements over the period of the study. The study found that the traf-&#13;
fic using the roads increased with associated reductions in transport costs and&#13;
charges. It also reported positive benefits in the agricultural economy, encouraged&#13;
a shift from low-value cereals to high-value fruit orchards. Similarly, improved&#13;
access to health and education facilities increased enrollment rates in rural educa-&#13;
tion as well as frequency of visits to health care services. This positive outcome was&#13;
qualified by several methodological concerns:&#13;
     ï&#130;§    The concept of control ("without project"). The study team put special em-&#13;
          phasis to select control roads which had not been the subject of im-&#13;
          provements during the project period, and which were geographically&#13;
          near the project. These were judgmentally selected at the end of the pro-&#13;
          ject. In contrast, communities on the project roads attracted other devel-&#13;
          opments so that not all the identified changes could be attributed to im-&#13;
          proved transport services alone.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Baseline data. No baseline data was collected before the road construction&#13;
          and retrospective questions were included in surveys to capture the pre-&#13;
          project conditions. It was then felt that this failing made reporting some&#13;
          indicators highly unreliable.&#13;
&#13;
These methodological concerns were rather prescient and subsequently addressed&#13;
by a new wave of evaluation specialists who highlighted the dangers of the simple&#13;
approach to longitudinal studies. Ravallion (2001) noted a number of problems&#13;
that relate to such project evaluations, which begin with the â&#128;&#156;knowledge market&#13;
failuresâ&#128;&#157; due to asymmetric information and externalities. Development agencies&#13;
are also prone to adopt quick and less rigorous methods that promise affirmative&#13;
results at minimum cost. Finally, the â&#128;&#156;project homeâ&#128;&#157; of many evaluations means&#13;
that the project management has little or no interest in applying the lessons&#13;
learned from an evaluation, which may raise more questions than it answers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                     Monitoring &amp; Evaluating Rural Transport Improvements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to generic problems, evaluations of projects present a number of spe-&#13;
cific challenges:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Rural transport investments are not directly productive but enable other&#13;
         productive and non-productive investments or initiatives to operate&#13;
         more efficiently and effectively. This enabling role means that the benefits&#13;
         of rural transport improvements will reflect the opportunities and con-&#13;
         strained afforded by the national political economy, social and other&#13;
         characteristics of the areas affected.&#13;
    ï&#130;§    There is considerable â&#128;&#156;endogeneityâ&#128;&#157; between the road network and the&#13;
         hierarchy of settlements and communities situated along the different&#13;
         road links. In many SSA situations, it is difficult to decide whether the&#13;
         road has attracted and stimulated the growth of settlements/communities&#13;
         or vice versa. This synergy makes it difficult to isolate and establish con-&#13;
         trol communities as required by the quasi-experimental model. This&#13;
         Jacoby referred to as reverse causation (Jacoby and Minten, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    The community and household focus of the research effort may overlook&#13;
         inter and intra-household differences in economic decision-making, so-&#13;
         cial needs and interaction.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Spillover from other development investments and the anticipated&#13;
         changes may take a long time to emerge.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Finally, rural road improvements must be sustained through mainte-&#13;
         nance to have long-term impacts. All too often, maintenance fails to&#13;
         reach the rural network and the improved roads slide back to their pre&#13;
         improvement status.&#13;
&#13;
Accordingly, current evaluation specialists advocate a number of statistical tech-&#13;
niques to ensure that randomly selected households and individuals in â&#128;&#156;withâ&#128;&#157; and&#13;
â&#128;&#156;withoutâ&#128;&#157; groups are as closely matched as possible (Baker, 1999, Van De Walle ,&#13;
2001). Thus, the evaluation team in Viet Nam used an approach that combined&#13;
the â&#128;&#156;double difference methodologyâ&#128;&#157; with propensity score matching methods&#13;
(see Annex 1) for the impact evaluation of a rural road rehabilitation project (Van&#13;
De Walle , 1999, Van De Walle and Cratty, 2002). This helps in the unbiased es-&#13;
timation of the counterfactual and from this identification of project impacts.&#13;
However, the approach requires considerable primary data collection and analysis&#13;
effort and depends on availability of good quality secondary data along with other&#13;
commune level secondary information. These technical, financial data resource&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      25&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
demands are very high, which explain the few â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; quantitative surveys&#13;
in SSA rural transport projects to date.&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
The advantages and disadvantages of the main impact methodologies outlined in&#13;
Table 2â&#128;&#147;3 point to the relative costs, data needs and ease of understanding of mac-&#13;
ro and micro analytical studies as a guide for policy makers. The use of these stud-&#13;
ies reflects data availability, and findings rely on establishing sound causal links&#13;
between rural road or access indicators and a range of developmental indicators.&#13;
Invariably this causal link is taken from the impact literature and there is very little&#13;
triangulation or cross checking of findings by qualitative methods.&#13;
&#13;
The three project impact methodologies show increasing sophistication, resource&#13;
needs and complexity. They tend to use primary data collected through a struc-&#13;
tured questionnaire administered to a head of household randomly sampled from&#13;
a secondary data source e.g. census returns, community lists etc. Qualitative re-&#13;
search methods are used to varying degrees to often guide the sampling process in&#13;
tandem with the administration of the questionnaire.&#13;
&#13;
Cross-sectional studies have now been discredited as a reliable methodology and&#13;
should not be used. Their inability to establish good controls means that compara-&#13;
tive analysis is likely to under or over state true project impacts.&#13;
&#13;
Longitudinal studies have a role to play in the monitoring of direct effects on traffic&#13;
and transport, provided the roads have been carefully selected as suitable counter-&#13;
factuals. They rely heavily on the project logical framework to identify appropriate&#13;
transport and access indicators against which the project can monitor its perfor-&#13;
mance. Unfortunately, their weakness in identifying â&#128;&#156;poorerâ&#128;&#157; households in the&#13;
travel stream means that these studies fail to highlight the impact of interventions&#13;
on the poor.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, panel surveys have become the most robust and acceptable methodology&#13;
employed to assess the indirect impact of interventions on the wider rural econo-&#13;
my, household welfare and poverty. The panel data has to be statistically manipu-&#13;
lated to control for endogeneity and heterogeneity before a double difference sta-&#13;
tistical comparison is made. This is the â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; of RCT impact methodol-&#13;
ogies but rural transport projects may not be large enough to warrant the technical&#13;
and financial resources needed to collect and analyze the large quantities of re-&#13;
quired impact data. The resultant findings, while defendable, may be insubstantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
and less than conclusive. This perceived failure of quantitative techniques to estab-&#13;
lish a definitive impact study has led â&#128;&#156;other specialists [to] argue that the analysis of&#13;
impact is best grounded in participatory and qualitative methodologiesâ&#128;&#157; (p.12, IFAD&#13;
2009). Nevertheless, Estache claims â&#128;&#156;the overall policy message of this research is&#13;
quite robust. Rural roads provide substantial benefits to households in low-income&#13;
countries, especially the poorest. But not all roads beneficiaries get the same benefits.&#13;
There is indeed a wide range of outcomes, including situations in which a specific out-&#13;
come is present in one project and not in another one within the same country. More-&#13;
over, they also show that rural roads are not a panacea for poverty alleviation and the&#13;
mechanics of poverty alleviation can vary quite a lot across projectsâ&#128;&#157; (p.17, 2010).&#13;
&#13;
Qualitative methods&#13;
Qualitative methods are now commonplace in most IEs when used to build up&#13;
information on likely outcome indicators, baseline attributes and controls for het-&#13;
erogeneity and other exogenous factors (Van De Walle , 2009). They also serve to&#13;
triangulate findings from quantitative tools as well as to explore the causal pro-&#13;
cesses in statistical associations and correlations. They usually fall into two types&#13;
â&#128;&#148; Rapid Rural Appraisal and Participatory Rural Appraisal.&#13;
&#13;
Thus, RRA techniques like focus group discussions and stakeholder analysis may&#13;
be used to explore the common travel patterns and map the location, dis-&#13;
tance/travel times to health, education and agricultural services, as well as under-&#13;
standing of the power relationships, influence, and interests of various groups&#13;
benefiting from an intervention. It is argued that well designed and facilitated,&#13;
qualitative methods are rigorous as they can count the uncountable, and generate&#13;
statistics for relevant dimensions otherwise overlooked (Chambers, 2009). The&#13;
Nigerian Community Service Delivery spreadsheet outlines such a qualitative ap-&#13;
proach to the monitoring of results and if sufficient time is allowed the impact of&#13;
rural infrastructural improvements (see Annex 4).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.3 Existing impact evaluation frameworks&#13;
&#13;
There are a number of existing impact evaluation guidelines and standard docu-&#13;
mentation for development projects including rural transport improvements.&#13;
They tend to be unique to each development agency, reflecting the need to plan&#13;
and improve their development programs as well as demonstrate that develop-&#13;
ment aid is targeted and delivering tangible benefits to the poor. Annex 2 outlines&#13;
the more important of these guidelines. They tend to distinguish three broad&#13;
methodological approaches to assessing socio-economic impacts, which are out-&#13;
lined below. The first and third are generally applied to specific DP-funded road&#13;
projects and rural transport programs while the second group is more often ap-&#13;
plied to policy level analysis and exploratory research.&#13;
&#13;
Cost-benefit analysis or cost comparisons.&#13;
Conventionally cost-benefit analysis, using a version of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Highway&#13;
Design and Maintenance [Standards model] (HDM III or IV), is applied to the&#13;
economic evaluation of rural road projects. As a rule of thumb, depending on the&#13;
improvement costs, such analysis requires a minimum of 50 motorized vehicles&#13;
per day, excluding motorcycles, for the road to generate a high enough economic&#13;
[internal] rate of return (EIRR). Thus, the first phase of the Secondary, Tertiary&#13;
and Rural Roads Project in Morocco, constructed three roads with some 192, 275&#13;
and 640 motorized vehicles per day. HDM III was applied to calculate the EIRRs&#13;
and the results ranged from 21% to 39% comfortably exceeding the 12% threshold&#13;
applied at the road selection and appraisal stage. This pattern was repeated in the&#13;
second phase, which ended in 2001 when similar traffic levels generated EIRRs in&#13;
excess of 15.9%.&#13;
&#13;
In the absence of traffic levels as high as this, the impact researcher looks to the&#13;
agricultural, education, health and other social benefits to justify the investment.&#13;
Thus in Ghana, the Road Prioritization Methodology (RPM) used a cost effective-&#13;
ness procedure to prioritize feeder roads for improvement assuming that bicycle&#13;
and head loading traffic would shift to motorized transport services once the road&#13;
was improved. A preliminary impact assessment of traffic levels showed that this&#13;
modal shift did not develop strongly as there was little or no evidence that the im-&#13;
proved roads had attracted regular transport services (DFRMST, 2006). These&#13;
findings affected the planning of further feeder road improvements to favor con-&#13;
necting rather than access feeder roads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      29&#13;
&amp;#12;Rural Transport in Africa â&#128;&#147; Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Ethiopia, Stifel et al. estimated the householdsâ&#128;&#153; willingness-to-pay for transport&#13;
services as a road planning indicator. Using a quasi-experimental setting, they sug-&#13;
gest that the benefits of reducing transport costs by US$50 per metric ton of goods&#13;
would result in benefits worth roughly 35 percent of household consumption.&#13;
They estimate that a 21-kilometer gravel road will have an IRR of up to 34 percent,&#13;
using conservative assumptions, over its first ten years (Stifel et al., 2012).&#13;
&#13;
Financial a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is also used to assess the impact and IRR of&#13;
feeder roads built by the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in Ethiopia. Con-&#13;
struction costs are averaged at the household level, while benefits are the estimated&#13;
transport cost savings involved in moving agricultural inputs and outputs. Other&#13;
travel benefits are estimated in time saving terms for household members to access&#13;
schools, water points and health centers (Metaferia Consulting Engineers, 2013).&#13;
&#13;
The assumptions behind these last three examples emphasize the difficulty of ap-&#13;
plying CBA techniques to investments on roads and tracks carrying low traffic&#13;
volumes. Increasingly, governments and development partners have looked to&#13;
socio-economic and service benefits to justify improvements. The challenge for&#13;
impact studies is to identify the direction and scale of these socio-economic bene-&#13;
fits so they can be quantified in economic and well-being terms.&#13;
&#13;
Macro and micro modeling&#13;
Statistical modeling has tended to be used by researchers to test or justify policy or&#13;
hypothetical RT subsector impacts on the national or regional economy.&#13;
&#13;
Macro modeling. The IFPRI approach to macro modeling has relied on a variety&#13;
of multiple regression techniques to highlight the factors, which include rural&#13;
transport access, that contribute to household poverty and estimate the direction&#13;
and strength of the relationships. One of the early examples of this type of model-&#13;
ing is from Uganda, using time-series district data. Access was measured in terms&#13;
of the average distance of households from three different types of roads, paved,&#13;
murram, and feeder roads. The analysis identified investment in feeder roads as&#13;
second to expenditure on agricultural research &amp; development with a cost-benefit&#13;
ratio ranging from 9.19 to 4.88 in Western and Northern Uganda. It estimates that&#13;
34 people were lifted out of poverty for every million shillings of government ex-&#13;
penditure on feeder roads compared with a ratio of 12 and 58 people lifted out of&#13;
poverty for agricultural research &amp; development (Fan and Zhang, 2004).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Another example of this approach is provided by the same authorsâ&#128;&#153; study in Tan-&#13;
zania, which uses a different data set to model total household income. Household&#13;
access to socio-economic services is represented by the proxy indicator: distance&#13;
(in km) of the household from public transportation facility. The results indicate&#13;
that distance to public transport has a statistically significant inverse relationship&#13;
with household income. This relationship weakens in three of the regions and even&#13;
becomes positive in Lake Victoria. The study goes on to use the findings to predict&#13;
the returns to investment, each kilometer of road built will increase income by&#13;
8.5%, which is equivalent to lifting 27 people out of poverty with a cost-benefit&#13;
ratio of 1:9.3 (Fan, Nuegen et al. 2005).&#13;
&#13;
Micro modeling. This approach tries to estimate the benefits of interventions at&#13;
the household level, which in SSA is synonymous with the agricultural household.&#13;
This has been tried in several ways:&#13;
&#13;
Travel time savings are a major benefit of transport investments in the developed&#13;
world where the time saved for journeys is valued at the augmented wage rate for&#13;
the person traveling and for non-work journeys by the willingness to pay for the&#13;
time saved. This relatively straightforward calculation is more difficult to apply to&#13;
developing countries because formal employment is limited and travel tends to be&#13;
for multiple reasons often with very low economic returns. Nevertheless, it is sug-&#13;
gested that if travel time were included in both impacts and appraisals this would&#13;
lead to â&#128;&#156;higher returns for RT projects and redress the bias against rural infrastructure&#13;
investmentsâ&#128;&#157; (p.xiii, I.T. Transport, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
Revealed and stated preference analyses are mainly used to model travel choice or-&#13;
journey behavior in terms of destinations, routes, modes etc. In the first, the re-&#13;
spondentâ&#128;²s choice is hypothetical and involves ranking or rating a set of journey&#13;
options in preference terms associated with the comfort, convenience, time saved,&#13;
willingness to pay for travel and/or its environmental impacts (Wardman, 2005).&#13;
In the revealed preference model, the journey attributes are based on actual travel&#13;
patterns and behavior. Stated preference techniques therefore tend to be used at&#13;
the appraisal or forecasting stage of a project when they may predict demand, ben-&#13;
efits or costs of an intervention.&#13;

2.4 RT project and policy indicators&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Rural transport indicators are variables that help measure changes brought about&#13;
by projects and as such should be specific to the sector and objectively verifiable.&#13;
In Table 2.1, each monitoring stream will use objectively verifiable indicators, out-&#13;
lined in the project Logical Framework Matrixâ&#128;&#147;LFM (Annex 3), to monitor the&#13;
progress, performance and impact of the intervention:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§   What progress a rural transport project or program has made?&#13;
     ï&#130;§   The efficiency and effectiveness of project performance in meeting targets,&#13;
     ï&#130;§   That the predicted effects/outcomes are happening, and&#13;
     ï&#130;§   To what extent its development goals have been met?&#13;
&#13;
However, indicators only provide an indication that something has happened â&#128;&#148;&#13;
they are not proof and cannot tell us:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§ Why a project has made a difference&#13;
     ï&#130;§ Why and how the changes have occurred&#13;
&#13;
Rural transport project monitoring indicators&#13;
Effect and Impact indicators. Effect and impact indicators cannot be constructed&#13;
without clarifying what aspect of the socio-economic environment is being â&#128;&#156;im-&#13;
pactedâ&#128;&#157; and what the indicators will â&#128;&#156;indicateâ&#128;&#157; beyond their intrinsic properties.&#13;
There are two possible starting points for the identification and selection of indica-&#13;
tors. For research programs which feed into policy formulation, indicators are&#13;
derived from hypotheses based on suppositions made about the positive role that&#13;
interventions play (transport changes, economic growth, social development or&#13;
poverty alleviation). This positivist perspective stresses benefits, identifies and mit-&#13;
igates negative effects and seeks confirmation that the investment was worthwhile.&#13;
For projects, this positivistic logic is distilled into a project logical frame in which&#13;
project outcomes/effects and impacts are identified as objectives and goals or pur-&#13;
poses. Invariably this includes a preliminary selection of objectively verified indi-&#13;
cators (OVI), sources of verification and assumptions made that might affect the&#13;
achievement of the objective or purpose in the form of a LFM (Annex 3).&#13;
&#13;
This distinction is important and ultimately explains the difference between per-&#13;
formance and impact monitoring (Figure 1-1). Performance monitoring is effec-&#13;
tively project monitoring and is relatively straight forward since expected effects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and impacts have already been defined and even quantified in the logical frame-&#13;
work. That said there is a danger that this very simplicity will lead to a blueprint&#13;
approach to assessing project achievements, reducing evaluations to quantitative&#13;
methodologies that produce two-dimensional cause-and-effect explanations with-&#13;
in a simple with/without longitudinal project sampling frame (No 4 of Table 2-).&#13;
&#13;
Policy impact studies are less constrained and as a result, much more complex&#13;
since they need to take account of interactions between the complimentary or&#13;
competing goals of stakeholders/actors involved in rural development as well as&#13;
overall development goals. It is therefore good practice to distinguish between&#13;
effect and impact indicators. For rural transport interventions, outcome perfor-&#13;
mance indicators are associated with traffic and access effects as captured by the&#13;
first group of direct effect indicators in Table 2-8.&#13;
&#13;
These indicators respond quickly to the intervention and are easy to collect and&#13;
report on as elaborated below. Access indicators do not require a traffic response&#13;
since they reflect changes in physical accessibility of the affected population or&#13;
beneficiaries. Both these effects are measurable within the project period but on&#13;
their own may not be enough to stimulate the behavioral changes that cumulative-&#13;
ly bring about an impact.&#13;
&#13;
These behavioral changes emerge over time in the form of increased income,&#13;
health, education and general well-being (Table 2-8) of the RT affected popula-&#13;
tion. The strength of impacts are subject to policy changes, road maintenance and&#13;
random fluctuations in rainfall, market prices, cost of fuel etc. These background&#13;
changes and fluctuation will increase over time making the identification and at-&#13;
tribution of impacts much more complex and the need to be factored into the tim-&#13;
ing of the follow-up survey(s).&#13;
&#13;
Finally, indicator data and impact analysis should be disaggregated and presented&#13;
for different population subgroups e.g. by gender, vulnerable and/or the poor and&#13;
capable of aggregated and generalized at the national, regional or global level.&#13;
(World Bank, GDPRP, FAO, 2012 p 23).&#13;
&#13;
In summary, the impact evaluators need the foresight to decide the scope of im-&#13;
pact, to design a research methodology and select appropriate indicators that can&#13;
be used to test relevant RT hypotheses before constructing the planned interven-&#13;
tions of the project. This selection involves understanding and integrating the pro-&#13;
ject logical framework with the development literature. Once finalized, the indica-&#13;

Transport service indicators. Transport service indicators are usually collected to&#13;
monitor project effects by longitudinal impact studies and focus on the cost,&#13;
speed, comfort, reliability and safety of the vehicles transporting people and goods.&#13;
In rural areas of SSA, transport vehicles tend to be of a lower standard than the&#13;
conventional vehicles using the national primary and secondary network. There&#13;
tends to be a wider range of modal types, including a number of locally adapted&#13;
intermediate means of transport (IMT), and both the transporter and their vehi-&#13;
cles are poorly regulated. A number of publications, notably those by Starkey et al&#13;
(2002, 2007 and 2010) as well as I.T. Transport (2003), give an idea of issues and&#13;
indicators used to assess the supply and demand for rural transport services. The&#13;
latest publication by Starkey et al. suggests that six headline indicators should be&#13;
used for each vehicle â&#128;&#152;classâ&#128;&#153; encountered on a rural road network:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§        Fare price per passenger kilometer&#13;
     ï&#130;§        Transport frequency on normal days&#13;
     ï&#130;§        Costs per tonneâ&#128;&#144;kilometre of small freight (50 kg loads)&#13;
     ï&#130;§        Costs per tonneâ&#128;&#144;kilometre of consigned medium freight (200 kg loads)&#13;
     ï&#130;§        Rural Transport Service reliability and predictability index for return&#13;
              trips to the market/services hub&#13;
     ï&#130;§        Rural Transport Service disruption index (Starkey et al, 2013)&#13;
&#13;
These indicators have been collected by the MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Ã&#137;quipment, du Transport&#13;
et de la Logistique (METL) in Morocco in addition to household travel and&#13;
transport data as a means of addressing the gap between demand and supply of&#13;
services. This gap exists because of METL/regional authorities are obliged to issue&#13;
transport operator permits on its improved roads and some 60% of these permits&#13;
are not utilized. Instead, informal operators are providing transport services on an&#13;
ad hoc unregulated basis and the ministry is concerned about this trend.&#13;
&#13;
RT development policy indicators&#13;
Background. The 2005 African Ministerial Meeting on the Transport and the Mil-&#13;
lennium Development Goals which took place in Addis Ababa identified seventeen&#13;
interventions that would support the achievement of the 2015 targets, twelve di-&#13;
rectly and indirectly involved the road transport sector:&#13;
&#13;
         1.     Halving the proportion of the rural population living beyond 2 km of&#13;
                an all-season road (Rural Access Index).&#13;
&#13;
         2.     Narrowing the difference in average transport costs within Africa as&#13;
                compared to Asia by 50%.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      3.   Eliminating constraints on the time that children spend in obtaining&#13;
           quality education safely by improving rural access and urban mobility.&#13;
&#13;
      4.   Facilitating affordable access for all households and cost effective out-&#13;
           reach of health activities.&#13;
&#13;
      5.   Ensuring that the transport sector stops to be an agent for spreading&#13;
           HIV/AIDS.&#13;
&#13;
      6.   Reducing road accident fatalities by half.&#13;
&#13;
      7.   Halving the number of urban and rural residents who have limited ac-&#13;
           cess to employment and essential services due to mobility constraint.&#13;
&#13;
      8.   Promoting environmental sustainability in all transport operations and&#13;
           development programs.&#13;
&#13;
      9.   Phasing out leaded gasoline, a target, which has been achieved.&#13;
&#13;
      10. Reducing by half transport costs for landlocked and transit countries&#13;
          and improving their access to global markets.&#13;
&#13;
      11. Dismantling all non-physical transport barriers including journey time,&#13;
          customs clearance, and border delays that impede the flow of goods&#13;
          and services.&#13;
      12. Mainstreaming gender issues in transport policies and programs.&#13;
&#13;
They all impinge on RT investments but six (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 12) are particularly&#13;
important for a robust impact study and for their contribution to the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Millennium Development Goals&#13;
The United Nations Millennium Summit of September 2000 sets out the achieve-&#13;
ment of nine Millennium Development Goals (MDG) as part of a global commit-&#13;
ment to development up to 2015. In policy terms, the MDGs and their agreed in-&#13;
dicators and targets have driven the development agenda and the national Poverty&#13;
Reduction Strategies (PRS) for most SSA counties. The focus is on the economic&#13;
and social well-being of developing country populations with no explicit reference&#13;
to transport infrastructure, the role of transport as a precondition to the achieve-&#13;
ment of many MDGâ&#128;&#153;s was initially overlooked. This oversight was addressed by&#13;
the 2005 Ministerial Meeting, which led to a Declaration on Transport and the&#13;
MDGs (African Union and UNECA, 2005). This set out the road sector MDG re-&#13;
lated targets outlined above which subsequently became a central feature of inter-&#13;
national development policy in the road transport sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      37&#13;

The width of the arrow is proportionate to the strength of relationship&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MDG 1 â&#128;&#147; eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. Some 80% of the population of&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa is directly dependent on agriculture for their food needs and&#13;
income. The role of rural transport in stimulating and supporting the develop-&#13;
ment and growth of this sector has the potential to improve food supplies and cash&#13;
crop earnings. Transport provides the rural poor with greater access to markets&#13;
and employment. Rural roads also reduce transport costs and improve market&#13;
access for enterprises and service providers, bringing further indirect benefits.&#13;
&#13;
MDG 2 â&#128;&#147; universal primary education. Section 0 elaborates the SSA evidence that&#13;
shows substantial links between RT development and increases in primary school&#13;
enrolment and attendance rates for both boys and girls by improving the accessi-&#13;
bility of primary schools.&#13;
&#13;
MDG 3 â&#128;&#147; gender equality and empower women. Empirical evidence outlined in&#13;
the section above on Education suggest a positive link between rural transport&#13;
development and the achievement of some of the indicators connected to this goal,&#13;
especially by extending the travel horizon of women, increased school enrolment&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
of girls, and increased interactions between women, government and NGO work-&#13;
ers. An impact study may be able to shed some light on this process by disaggre-&#13;
gating its findings by gender.&#13;
&#13;
MDG 4 on child mortality, MDG 5 on maternal health, and MDG 6 on&#13;
HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. These three health-related MDGs show a&#13;
strong relationship with the rural road network and its physical access. Empirical&#13;
studies across SSA suggest that child illnesses are more likely to be treated the clos-&#13;
er the child is to a health clinic. Similarly, child nutrition and health outreach pro-&#13;
grams are likely to be more effective as access improves. The perinatal and postna-&#13;
tal care of pregnant women is equally sensitive to transport services and the dis-&#13;
tance involved in access maternity/mother and child clinics. Rural transport im-&#13;
provements also support routine medical visits, provision of emergency services,&#13;
health care provider access, and mobile health service delivery to isolated commu-&#13;
nities and populations. In addition, transport networks and services play a vital&#13;
logistic role in assuring the distribution of drugs and supplies.&#13;
&#13;
Conversely, by encouraging greater mobility, transport has stimulated an increase&#13;
in road traffic accidents one of the leading causes of death in SSA. Mobility has&#13;
also increased the spread of transmittable diseases like HIV/AIDS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MDG 7 on environmental sustainability, MDG 8 on global partnership for de-&#13;
velopment and MDG 9 on de-mining and victim assistance&#13;
&#13;
Rural transport interventions do not have a strong record of increasing environ-&#13;
mental sustainability. Typically, improvements intensify the exploitation of re-&#13;
sources. The study in Mozambique noted that road rehabilitation in the ZambÃ©zia&#13;
province led to increased exploitation of natural resources such as land, water and&#13;
timber and there seemed to be no long-term efforts to protect these resources and&#13;
local community rights to use them (SCDS, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
Rural transport improvements are considered a positive manifestation of the glob-&#13;
al partnership for development. This arises from their perceived pro poor focus,&#13;
which often has stressed the application of labor-intensive technologies that use&#13;
local male and female young people to construct access roads. The International&#13;
Labour Organization has been in the forefront of this advocacy and has piloted a&#13;
number of projects like the Quick Impact Employment Creation Project (QIECP)&#13;
in Sierra Leone (ILO 2012).&#13;

&#13;
The Rural Access Index (RAI)&#13;
Besides the Declaration on Transport and the MDGs, the transport sector minis-&#13;
ters endorsed the development and application of the Rural Access Index (RAI) as&#13;
a headline indicator, which highlights the critical role of access and mobility in&#13;
reducing poverty (Roberts et al, 2006). This index measures the number of rural&#13;
people who live within two kilometers (typically equivalent to a walk of 20-25&#13;
minutes) of an all-season road as a proportion of the total rural population. Alt-&#13;
hough it appears to be a simple indicator it remains to be carefully defined:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    An â&#128;&#156;all-season roadâ&#128;&#157; is motorable all year round by the prevailing means&#13;
          of rural transport (typically a pick-up or a truck that does not have four-&#13;
          wheel-drive). Occasional interruptions of short duration during inclem-&#13;
          ent weather are accepted, particularly on lightly trafficked roads.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Time/distance equivalence is assumed uniform but in undulating coun-&#13;
          tryside, time differences between uphill and downhill sections can be con-&#13;
          siderable and local ground truthing is needed to correct for this. This as-&#13;
          sumption of equivalence is further complicated by the tendency of re-&#13;
          searchers to focus on travel time as their access indicator. They and their&#13;
          respondents think of time passing in 30 and 60-minute units and typical-&#13;
          ly use a 30-minute threshold when assessing travel or access times. This&#13;
          makes distance equivalence calculations more complex than the RAI en-&#13;
          visaged.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Who is travelling is also important. In South Africa, the Labor Force Sur-&#13;
          veys used to measure the journey to primary and secondary schools, as-&#13;
          sume that schoolchildren walk at 15 minutes per kilometer not the 10 to&#13;
          12.5 minutes assumed by the RAI (p.82, Directorate of Monitoring and&#13;
          Evaluation, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Subsequent experience in the use of RAI has identified other concerns:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    In emphasizing physical access, the index assumes that transport services&#13;
          will automatically be available on the all-weather road networkâ&#128;&#148;a road&#13;
          impact myth according to Beuran et al. (2013). Thus, in low rural popu-&#13;
          lation density areas like Malawi where motorized service exist they are&#13;
          usually unaffordable and often non-existent, which means that most&#13;
          households will continue to be isolated and reliant on cycling or more&#13;
          probably walking to travel outside the community (Raballand, et al.,&#13;
          2011). Similarly, RAI access tracking in Ethiopia indicates that 38.6% of&#13;
          the rural population lives within 2 kilometers of an all-weather road but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    only 28.4% within 2 kilometers of a transport service delivery station&#13;
    (W.T. Consult, 2013). The central message of â&#128;&#156;Roads Are Not Enoughâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
    (Dawson and Barwell, 1993) seems to have been overlooked and RAI is&#13;
    not fully capturing the complexities of â&#128;&#156;accessâ&#128;&#157; which includes the availa-&#13;
    bility, affordability and reliability of transport services.&#13;
ï&#130;§   International and intranational comparisons can be misleading because&#13;
    of differing population densities, proportions of land available for arable&#13;
    cultivation and settlement patterns. The well-watered densely populated&#13;
    equatorial and savanna zones of West and East Africa will have much&#13;
    higher RAI values than the more marginal savanna and miombo wood-&#13;
    land zones of Eastern and Southern Africa with their dispersed settlement&#13;
    patterns. Similarly, RAI comparisons between Ashanti and Northern Re-&#13;
    gions in Ghana will produce different values reflecting population density&#13;
    and contrasting nuclear and dispersed settlement patterns.&#13;
ï&#130;§   Measurement differences between the use of subjective household surveys&#13;
    and more objective use of GIS systems to calculate RAI have also been&#13;
    highlighted by Vincent (2010). The latter seem more common as they can&#13;
    be routinely generated by an updated geo-referenced network database&#13;
    but this very simplicity is insensitive to local barriers, which may con-&#13;
    strain access.&#13;
ï&#130;§   From a planning perspective, a 2010 study questioned the use of the RAI&#13;
    in network planning (Raballand, Macchi, and Petracco, 2010). They ar-&#13;
    gued that the index could overestimate the needs for rural roads and lead&#13;
    to over-investments compared with main and secondary road networks.&#13;
    They propose instead a reference distance of 5 kilometers, not 2 kilome-&#13;
    ters. Some SSA countries appear to have already adopted this 5-kilometer&#13;
    standard e.g. the published Performance and Impact indicators for Sene-&#13;
    gal show that 62.5% of the rural population lives within 5 kilometers of&#13;
    an all-season road. In contrast, Morocco uses a one kilometer threshold&#13;
    to define its National Rural Road Access Indicator (NRRAI).&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;§   Another example of this ambitious agenda is Uganda, which has invested&#13;
    heavily in the road sector, especially in rural roads. Yet, its RAI is less than&#13;
    30% and reaching a RAI of 100% will not be cost effective as the expected&#13;
    benefit of such investment given existing transport patterns would be&#13;
    minimal, while the investments required to achieve it are unaffordable.&#13;
    (Raballand et al., 2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   41&#13;
&amp;#12;Rural Transport in Africa â&#128;&#147; Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Finally, maintaining the initial momentum in collecting RAI indicator&#13;
          data has not been successful. It is claimed that there is very little explicit&#13;
          monitoring of rural transport impacts on MDGs within national pro-&#13;
          grams and projects and the calculation of RAI shows wide variations in its&#13;
          temporal and spatial application since its first SSA-wide application in&#13;
          2006 (Vincent, 2010).&#13;
&#13;
In conclusion, RAI is better seen as a measure of network density rather than as an&#13;
absolute indicator of the required level of investment. It is best used in the frame-&#13;
work of a mixture of different standards of road and a vibrant rural economy gen-&#13;
erating sufficient demand to attract a supply of different and competing transport&#13;
services. Where this is absent then the need to improve the overall access of rural&#13;
communities and deliver the last â&#128;&#156;mileâ&#128;&#157; is best served by footpaths or IMT tracks&#13;
built and maintained by communities to a level that reflects their importance and&#13;
use (Gachassin et al., 2010). For this reason, Walker calculated a second measure&#13;
of access, which was district-level road density (kilometers of road length per sq.&#13;
km. area). This measure is also highly-scale dependent, but it provides a popula-&#13;
tion independent measure of road network availability. (Walker, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
From an impact perspective, RAI is mainly of value for international and intra-&#13;
national multifactorial regression or econometric analysis. Here the above con-&#13;
cerns have to be taken into account when making comparisons and drawing asso-&#13;
ciations between RAI and socio-economic indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.5 RT indicator data collection tools&#13;
&#13;
The first three tools are associated with measuring traffic outcome indicators,&#13;
which precedes and predates any attempt to assess a rural transport impact. Inter-&#13;
vention rationale indicates that if there are no traffic outcomes there can be no&#13;
development benefit or impact since the former, through lower transport charges,&#13;
drives the latter. This emphasis on transport charges rather than costs reflects the&#13;
importance of transport services. In SSA, the majority of people living in a roadâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
zone of influence or corridor tend not to own or have access to private motor ve-&#13;

&#13;
hicles 6. They rely on transport services provided by transport operators and while&#13;
these operators may benefit from lower operating costs, they may not pass these&#13;
savings on in the form of lower transport charges. If this is the case that the afford-&#13;
ability of transport services remains unchanged and the wider impact will be re-&#13;
duced. Equally, the road must be maintained so that its transport service and ac-&#13;
cess benefits are sustained.&#13;
&#13;
Traffic census and surveys&#13;
The data collection format of the traffic census varies by country and the organiza-&#13;
tion carrying out the survey. The key characteristic of the census form has to pro-&#13;
vide a clear definition of the transport modes likely to be encountered in the sur-&#13;
vey. These should include intermediate means of transport and pedestrians, the&#13;
latter are often differentiated by load carrying or not. It is common practice to&#13;
break up the notation of the count at hourly intervals over a 12-hour day, starting&#13;
when people are known to be moving. Impact evaluations should also undertake a&#13;
survey of the traffic stream to ascertain the characteristics of each mode (who is&#13;
travelling, for what purpose, cost of the journey, time taken, etc.). This will involve&#13;
using sample surveys of transport operators and users to ascertain their character-&#13;
istics. It might be possible to widen this to capture the economic status of those&#13;
travelling in order to asses if the poor are affected by or benefiting from the inter-&#13;
vention. Different data formats along with practical advice on the organization of&#13;
traffic counts are given by Fouracre and Starkey (Fouracre, 2001 and Starkey,&#13;
2007).&#13;
&#13;
Road user satisfaction surveys&#13;
Road user satisfaction surveys (RUSS) are a relatively recent introduction to im-&#13;
pact evaluations and they vary in their intensity and scope. Their origin lies in the&#13;
institutional reforms that have separated policy setting and regulation from the&#13;
execution of works and maintenance in the transport sector throughout much of&#13;
SSA. More emphasis on â&#128;&#156;governanceâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;accountabilityâ&#128;&#157; was therefore placed&#13;
with the new ministries, executive agencies, road funds, etc., and the resultant&#13;
â&#128;&#156;service cultureâ&#128;&#157; seeks and responds to feedback from its â&#128;&#156;clientsâ&#128;&#157; i.e. the road&#13;
users. Thus, the logical framework for TANROADS in Tanzania identifies â&#128;&#156;road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
  It should be noted that the availability and widespread ownership of low cost Chinese&#13;
motorcycles has had a profound impact on rural access and mobility as well as transport -&#13;
â&#128;&#156;okadaâ&#128;&#157; services in much of SSA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        43&#13;

&#13;
users satisfiedâ&#128;&#157; as a performance indicator of its primary road development and&#13;
maintenance activities. This indicator is addressed by satisfaction surveys (Lyatu,&#13;
2000). More recently, the Federal Road Sector Development Team (RSDT) of Ni-&#13;
geria developed a road user satisfaction survey to:&#13;
&#13;
        ï&#130;§    Measure customer satisfaction of road network outcomes or attributes&#13;
             through a few sets of major indicators (including all key performance&#13;
             indicators from the Project Appraisal Document), each with a number&#13;
             of sub-indicators.&#13;
        ï&#130;§    Measure customer perceptions of RSDT at state and national levels&#13;
             through a few sets of major indicators, each with a number of sub-&#13;
             indicators.&#13;
&#13;
Again the outcome of these services was to strengthen the performance monitor-&#13;
ing and accountability of the road sector.&#13;
&#13;
An example of a typical RUSS is a survey carried out on behalf of the Himachal&#13;
Pradesh Public Works Department to identify drivers of user satisfaction, measure&#13;
satisfaction levels and capture expectations of road users (Marketing &amp; Develop-&#13;
ment Research Associates, 2007). It undertook a sample of more than 6,500 road&#13;
users stratified by road type and proportion of traffic using each type of road.&#13;
&#13;
Cordon surveys&#13;
Cordon surveys are targeted surveys on all access routes leading to a market, town&#13;
or discrete area (a national park). Their objective is to survey all traffic entering or&#13;
leaving the area around the point of interest. In transport terms, they are often&#13;
used to build up a picture of traffic flows in an urban area as part of the prepara-&#13;
tion of a master plan. In rural transport terms, they are occasionally used to assess&#13;
traffic accessing an important rural market.&#13;
&#13;
Community/household surveys&#13;
Community or household surveys usually serve to assess the indirect impact of a&#13;
rural transport project. They rely on questionnaires or interview schedules to col-&#13;
lect impact indicator data from the project area. Their function is to quantify the&#13;
travel, transport and access characteristics of the household as well as its socio-&#13;
economic attributes by interviewing the main community and household decision&#13;
makers. The compilation of the questionnaire follows a number of principles.&#13;

Table 2-8 Recommendations for the preparation of household survey questionnaires&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
- Phrase each question so that the information it provides tests a hypothesis or quantifies an indi-&#13;
  cator that contributes to answering an evaluation question.&#13;
- Adopt a concentric approach i.e. beginning with the household then taking the respondent&#13;
  through a logical sequence of events that are interconnected and are likely to be remembered&#13;
  by association.&#13;
- The questionnaire should contain a mix of open and closed questions that allows the respond-&#13;
  ent to articulate his/her reasons rather than be obliged to use a preconceived framework of&#13;
  stock answers.&#13;
- Include one or more repetitive questions as a means of testing the reliability* of the respond-&#13;
  entâ&#128;&#153;s answers. Ideally, these questions should replicate those used by the Country Statistical Of-&#13;
  fice (CSO) in their Household Surveys and Demographic Health Surveys**.&#13;
- Use tested questionnaires and adjust them to reflect the focus of the impact study as well as the&#13;
  social and cultural environment in which they will be applied. This adjustment process involves:&#13;
   ï&#130;§ Fine-tuning the number of variables to the impact study area and time period envisaged be-&#13;
      tween the baseline and follow-up survey. For example, the mix of â&#128;&#156;modernâ&#128;&#157; farm inputs avail-&#13;
      able in an impact area reflects current agricultural extension effort and advice on best prac-&#13;
      tice. Similarly, government efforts to encourage free primary schools may affect the applica-&#13;
      bility of school enrolments as an impact indicator and might be replaced by a literacy variable&#13;
      if the follow up survey is planned for some 4 to 5 years after the RT intervention.&#13;
   ï&#130;§ If the objective of the evaluation is to estimate RTâ&#128;&#153;s impact on poverty then it is essential that&#13;
      the questionnaire include income and expenditure/consumption data. Most questionnaires&#13;
      use of the latter, because it can be collected with lower measurement errors than household&#13;
      income. Others rely on surrogate welfare indicators such as asset holdings. In the latter case,&#13;
      the availability of Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS) would enable the researcher&#13;
      to validate the use of expenditure and asset data through correlation or regression analysis.&#13;
   ï&#130;§ The draft questionnaire should be pretested and piloted. Pretesting will involve translating it&#13;
      into the local language or languages and retranslating it back using different translators. This&#13;
      will help identify and eliminate poor phrasing and ambiguities as well as provide the re-&#13;
      searcher with cultural insights and an understanding of local courtesies needed to allay any&#13;
      interviewer resistance. At the end of this process, it may be possible to finalize the translation&#13;
      of the questionnaire and print it into the local language.&#13;
   ï&#130;§ It is important that methodological continuity is maintained by a detailed description of the&#13;
      randomization process, the location of the individual respondents or the timing and/or se-&#13;
      quencing of the survey. This should be backed up by a map and GPS coordinates of the&#13;
      household and community locations.&#13;
   ï&#130;§ Anticipate attrition rates and compensate by increasing the number of respondent in the&#13;
      baseline. The follow study needs to check if attrition is neutral and does not affect the repre-&#13;
      sentativeness of the sample.&#13;
* In research terms reliability is a measure of consistency and a respondent is regarded as reliable if their&#13;
   answers are the same for the repeated questions.&#13;
** This will not only improve the reliability of the findings but enable them to be generalised and scaled&#13;
   up to the regional or national context.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The community questionnaire is usually shorter and less structured than the&#13;
household questionnaire. This difference reflects the fact that it is usually adminis-&#13;
tered to a group of community representatives, or other social and gender group-&#13;
ings. Its function is to overlap and crosscheck household data as well as provide a&#13;
picture of access constraints, normal patterns of travel and transport, etc. Worth&#13;
mentioning in this context are community service delivery surveys. These surveys&#13;
are particularly effective for monitoring community-driven RT projects, because&#13;
the survey can actually become part of the project, and the responsibility for its&#13;
monitoring can be progressively passed on to the community itself. One of the big&#13;
advantages of a community survey is that a relatively large number of communi-&#13;
ties can be covered in a relatively short time.&#13;
&#13;
Preparing questionnaires is not an exact science and fortunately, there are a num-&#13;
ber of models that have been applied to RT projects and studies. These include the&#13;
Annotated Prototype Household and Community Questionnaires in Technical&#13;
Notes 6 and 7 of Murphyâ&#128;&#153;s elaboration of a rapid survey method for assessing pov-&#13;
erty reducing impacts of ILO employment intensive projects (1998). Grootaert&#13;
(2002) also provides detailed guidelines on how to conduct an impact study with&#13;
prototype questionnaires and interview schedules. Starkey (2007) Methodology for&#13;
the Rapid Assessment of Rural Transport Services illustrates another approach,&#13;
which does not provide prototype questionnaires but a checklist of questions to be&#13;
asked of a wide range of stakeholders including households and communities.&#13;
&#13;
These models will need adjustments to reflect the focus of the impact study as well&#13;
as the social and cultural environment in which they will be applied.&#13;
&#13;
Agricultural surveys&#13;
Given the importance of agriculture and both the subsistence and income generat-&#13;
ing needs of most of the rural population in SSA, an impact study will need to in-&#13;
clude agricultural variables in the household and community questionnaires.&#13;
From a rural transport perspective, this will provide indicator data able to test the&#13;
agricultural impacts outlined in Section Rural Economy. The prototype question-&#13;
naires mentioned above partially provide for this by including activities such as the&#13;
crop mix, use of inputs, visits of extension agents, marketing of crops etc. with an&#13;
emphasis on who is responsible, where did they travel, how much did they&#13;
transport, prices received and cost involved. Table 2-10 illustrates the typical agri-&#13;
cultural access related concerns of a rural transport project.&#13;

Rapid rural assessment/appraisal (RRA)&#13;
&#13;
The methodology used in rapid rural assessments has been advocated as a prag-&#13;
matic and efficient response to heavy resource demands for data collection. Data&#13;
collection is expensive and usually consumes more than half the budget set aside&#13;
for an impact study (Baker, 2000). The ILOâ&#128;&#153;s Development Policies Department&#13;
initiated the establishment of a system for the rapid assessment of poverty impacts&#13;
(RAPI) (Murphy, 1998). The ILO, like many other development partners involved&#13;
in the subsector was faced with the problem of collecting primary impact data in&#13;
order to demonstrate the effectiveness or results of its employment-intensive pro-&#13;
jects. The mini surveys Murphy were designed to address this need by: (i) the use&#13;
of short questionnaires, (ii) a reduced sample size and (iii) the use of computers in&#13;
data collection and analysis. These steps reduced data collection costs and led to&#13;
fast feedback of impact results to decision-makers. Bamberger endorses such an&#13;
approach to reduce the length and complexity of the surveys but warns there are&#13;
trade-offsâ&#128;&#148;smaller samples reduce the statistical precision of resultant findings&#13;
and the level of disaggregation of the analysis. This in turn limits the generalizabil-&#13;
ity of the findings, which remain unique project-centered â&#128;&#156;case studiesâ&#128;&#157; anchored&#13;
in the â&#128;&#156;gray literatureâ&#128;&#157; rather than as published contributions to international&#13;
development literature (Macintyre et al., 1999).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                47&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Participatory rural assessment (PRA)&#13;
Participatory methods are used at various stages of a project cycle. They are valua-&#13;
ble to an impact study because they seek the opinions and perspectives of the&#13;
beneficiaries who can be disaggregated into appropriate socio-economic and gen-&#13;
der groupings. In the past, they were perceived as less â&#128;&#156;scientificâ&#128;&#157; research tools,&#13;
which provided case studies or anecdotal information of limited value to main-&#13;
stream quantitative surveys. Even now when a PRA is accepted as a means of&#13;
providing insights into statistical findings and results, it is still â&#128;&#156;not well appreciated&#13;
or usedâ&#128;&#157; by the transport sector (p. 77, Banjo, et al., 2012).&#13;
&#13;
In conclusion, qualitative methods work well and provide insights that structured&#13;
formal surveys can seldom do on their own. Importantly, they are not a â&#128;&#156;quick&#13;
and dirtyâ&#128;&#157; way of measuring impact but need expertise and time if they are to be&#13;
effective impact monitoring tools.&#13;
&#13;
Further discussion of these techniques and the role of participatory rural assess-&#13;
ment (PRA) in rural transport projects can be found in Davis, A. S. C. (2001),&#13;
while Start and Hovland (2004) and Catley et al. (2007) introduce the PRA tech-&#13;
niques in impact assessment of development policies and non-rural transport pro-&#13;
jects. Hettige is the most widely available example of the application of RRA tech-&#13;
niques to transport impacts (2006).&#13;
&#13;
Geographical information system (GIS)&#13;
Starkey recommends that all M&amp;E data collected for an impact evaluation be geo-&#13;
referenced. For this, Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates should be rec-&#13;
orded for all relevant locations and the distance between them calculated. In many&#13;
situations, basic GIS data may already exist for villages and the road network but&#13;
may need verification (Starkey, 2007). In other studies, a vehicle-mounted camera&#13;
was used to record speed, GPS position and video each road and geolocate every&#13;
market. This data enabled the researchers to calculate average speeds and distances&#13;
to local and urban markets and used as variables in their regression analysis (Casa-&#13;
buri et al., 2013).&#13;
&#13;
A good example of the widespread use of GIS is Lesotho where the Ministry of&#13;
Public Works and Transport has committed itself to use GIS in its management of&#13;
the road sector. It is used as a planning tool to (i) target investments more effi-&#13;
ciently at areas of poverty; (ii) coordinate data across sectors, (iii) monitor indica-&#13;
tors and impacts, and (iv) facilitate stakeholder communication and participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry also piloted the integration of participatory sketch mapping and GIS.&#13;
The maps are drawn by focus groups who locate key destinations, services, and&#13;
routes (e.g., footpaths and roads) in their community. They also identify opportu-&#13;
nities as well as transport and access barriers (e.g., cost, time, mode, seasonal dis-&#13;
ruptions). The maps are then georeferenced via global positioning system (GPS)&#13;
points for key destinations and paths. These are then incorporated as layers in the&#13;
GIS database of the ministry, extrapolating from the GPS points and place names&#13;
on the sketch map. The layers can be viewed alongside base maps and other layers,&#13;
thereby integrating local stakeholder perspectives and issues into decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
Walker et al. have been able to integrate this road sector GIS data with Demo-&#13;
graphic and Health Survey (DHS) results by georeferencing the locations of survey&#13;
enumeration areas or clusters. The DHS highlights a number of transport and ac-&#13;
cess constraints facing households seeking healthcare as well as other health service&#13;
barriers associated with quality of facilities/personnel or cultural restrictions. DHS&#13;
surveys also emphasize gender differences in access and use of health services and&#13;
can therefore help better understand gendered differences in access and mobility.&#13;
The resultant spatial data also lends itself to planners of rural transport and health&#13;
care interventions as well as monitoring the achievement the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.6 Existing data sources for monitoring of the impacts of projects&#13;
&#13;
A number of surveys and studies on rural transport impact evaluation regularly&#13;
funded by governments and executed by the CSO are of value. Some refers to large&#13;
countrywide surveys with little opportunity to add access questions. Nevertheless,&#13;
they are important sources of secondary data, which an impact study needs in the&#13;
planning and execution of its surveys as well as a source of triangulation data dur-&#13;
ing the analysis phase. The most important of these country surveys is the popula-&#13;
tion census, normally undertaken every ten years. The census results and its enu-&#13;
meration areas usually provide essential information for preparing sample frames&#13;
for any rural transport impact study and enable the findings to be generalized to&#13;
other rural areas. The census is often closely linked with an agricultural census.&#13;
This is undergoing some changes as the new World Program for the Census of&#13;
Agriculture (WCA) 2010 advocates a separate system of integrated agricultural&#13;
census and surveys. It is possible that the new agricultural surveys will include so-&#13;
cio-economic community attributes as well as access and use of community agri-&#13;
culture-related infrastructure, which may provide useful information for an im-&#13;
pact study (World Bank, GDPRP, FAO, 2012 p. 45).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       49&#13;
&amp;#12;Rural Transport in Africa â&#128;&#147; Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other country surveys usually rely on sample data and include Living Standards&#13;
Measurement Studies (LSMS) and Household Budget Surveys (HBS). Depending&#13;
on the country context, these may contain access data, which may be comprehen-&#13;
sive enough to undertake econometric analysis (Gachassin, 2010, Fan, Nyange et&#13;
al., 2005) or may be supplemented by specifically designed transport surveys as in&#13;
Ghana. The availability and usefulness of these secondary data sources tends to be&#13;
country specific as the M&amp;E success stories show.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, access as measured by distance or time may feature in other sector&#13;
surveys. Thus, a study of barriers to the care of HIV-infected children in rural&#13;
Zambia used an existing medical cohort study to highlight role of rural transport&#13;
on HIV treatment (van Dijk J. H. et al, 2007). Walker et al. have also been able to&#13;
use Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in Lesotho, Ethiopia and Ghana to&#13;
explore access and mobility to health care services (2009). Similarly, road access is&#13;
one of the indicators collected in the Ghana Living Standards Measurement Survey&#13;
and Lavy et al were able to use this to calculate elasticities for primary school at-&#13;
tendance (1996).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.7 M&amp;E success stories&#13;
&#13;
Ethiopia&#13;
Country Commitment. Ethiopia has shown a considerable commitment to the&#13;
road sector which has seen its network increase from 26,550 km in 1997 when the&#13;
first Road Sector Development Program was launched to 85,966 km in 2013 (a&#13;
224% increase). This impressive achievement underlines the ability of the road&#13;
authorities to lead and manage the current Road Sector Development Program&#13;
(RSDP). The government has funded some 77% of RSDP IV investments as part&#13;
of its â&#128;&#156;Growth and Transformation Plan (2010/11-2014/15)â&#128;&#157;. This stresses the&#13;
importance of road transport as a means of developing other productive sectors&#13;
such as agriculture, industry, mining, tourism as well as the delivery of education&#13;
and health services.&#13;
&#13;
This commitment has also seen the expansion of the rural network and the initia-&#13;
tion of the Universal Rural Road Access Program (URRAP) in 2011, in order to&#13;
provide all-weather road access to all kebeles in the next few years. The success of&#13;
this strategy can be judged by the RAI, which has reportedly increased from 13%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in 1997 to 39% in 2011/12 (WT Consult, 2013). Furthermore, if URRAP achieves&#13;
its construction targets, the RAI should increase to about 80% (ERA, 2013).&#13;
&#13;
Rural road construction is also important in other sector activities. Thus, the Pro-&#13;
ductive Safety Net Program, one of the largest social protection programs, uses&#13;
labor-intensive methods to construct community infrastructure like feeder roads,&#13;
health posts, and primary schools as well as to rehabilitate natural resources in&#13;
some of the poorest weredas. The agricultural sector is also cooperating with the&#13;
Ethiopia Roads Authority (ERA) in the construction of access roads in areas of&#13;
high agricultural potential.&#13;
&#13;
However, this rapid expansion of the road network seems to have stretched the&#13;
human and managerial resources of the regional and wereda administration. A&#13;
recent review of M&amp;E capacity highlighted the weaknesses of regional road sector&#13;
M&amp;E systems, which were reportedly non-existent in some weredas. These weak-&#13;
nesses extended to regional staff who were unclear as to current M&amp;E reporting&#13;
requirements and the definition and purpose of the management indicator data&#13;
they were collecting (Central Statistical Agency, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
Existing and planned impact assessments. ERA has commissioned several impact&#13;
studies. The first one, Transport and Poverty Observatory ran from 2005 to 2011&#13;
and involved an assessment of the poverty impacts of trunk road project invest-&#13;
ment at the community and household levels undertaken by two consultants. The&#13;
first consultant dealt with the baseline when some 1,100 households were inter-&#13;
viewed within and outside the Project Road Influence Area (PRIA). The sampling&#13;
frame included both urban and rural households and the identification of homog-&#13;
enous segments of the road corridors as a means of minimizing exogenous factors.&#13;
The second consultant was responsible for the follow-up surveys and their final&#13;
analysis in 2011. At this follow-up stage, the sample size was reduced by 25% and&#13;
the adopted analytical approach was a simple cross-sectional rural/urban compari-&#13;
sons of baseline and follow-up data presented as descriptive statistics and percent-&#13;
ages in a tabular format. The uncertain validity and reliability of the baseline sur-&#13;
vey and the high attrition rate of the panel survey meant that findings were tenta-&#13;
tive and qualified â&#128;&#156;the decreasing rate of literacy may be the result of the missing&#13;
households that were reported during the baseline as literate peopleâ&#128;&#157; (p. 111, Selam&#13;
Development Consultants, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
ERAâ&#128;&#153;s reaction to this report has been understandably cautious and its findings are&#13;
used selectively as anecdotal evidence rather than as authoritative statements of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      51&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
impacts. They have also tried to learn from this experience and have engaged the&#13;
services of an international consultant to undertake a second Poverty Observatory&#13;
Impact study. The methodology outlined in this service contract is impressive and&#13;
commits the study to panel surveys that will be propensity score matched and&#13;
econometrically analyzed to isolate and attribute road impacts. The baseline and&#13;
second round of data collection has been reported on in a descriptive way but&#13;
there are a number of characteristics of this study that may undermine its ability to&#13;
identify impacts. First, the study is monitoring changes on an annual basis from&#13;
2012 to 2016 with a final analysis in 2016. It is reported that none of the trunk&#13;
roads will be completed until 2015 so the monitoring effort will largely capture&#13;
outcomes or effects with too little time allowed for impacts to emerge. Second, the&#13;
baseline cross-sectional sampling frame is compromised by URRAP road im-&#13;
provement activity in the four trunk road corridors. URRAP-funded feeder road&#13;
construction is affecting the access criteria used to define the zones of road influ-&#13;
ence (â&#128;&#156;ZORIâ&#128;&#157;) which identify with/without communities and households in the&#13;
sample road corridors. It is also likely that the 960 household baseline sample will&#13;
not be large enough for the level of robust impact analysis envisaged some five&#13;
years after road completion.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, ERA is in the process of engaging consultancy services for the impact eval-&#13;
uation of the URRAP across the country. The Terms of Reference (TOR) for these&#13;
services envisages a widespread impact study with â&#128;&#156;representativeâ&#128;&#157; samples drawn&#13;
from all regions and weredas benefitting from feeder road improvements. This&#13;
study represents an opportunity for both ERA and SSATP to dialogue and if possi-&#13;
ble strengthen the qualitative assurance management of the contracted consultan-&#13;
cy services to ensure that Ethiopia can pioneer the application of â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
RCT-based road impact evaluation in SSA.&#13;
&#13;
The PSNP (Productive Safety Net Program) has also initiated a number of impact&#13;
studies with a distinct focus on micro catchments as their M&amp;E unit. This reflects&#13;
PSNPâ&#128;&#153;s emphasis on the productivity gains arising from their soil and water con-&#13;
servation efforts. This focus on a small number of micro catchments enables the&#13;
impacts to use innovative proxy indicators like transport cost and travel time sav-&#13;
ings within a financial CBA framework. These impacts also use qualitative tech-&#13;
niques to explore change processes and explanations (Metaferia, 2013).&#13;
&#13;
Impact evaluation. Both the RSDP and the PSNP recognize the importance of&#13;
impact evaluations in affirming the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s policy focus on rural infrastruc-&#13;
ture improvements and have set aside considerable resources for several impact&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
studies. The contract value of the current Transport and Poverty Observatory&#13;
study is some $750,000.&#13;
&#13;
All of these studies tend to utilize a range of qualified in-country consultants to&#13;
deliver the impact services and rely on in-house staff to manage the impact evalua-&#13;
tion team. The high workload of ERA contract management staff is such that they&#13;
in turn rely on the integrity of the procured consultants to deliver rigorous and&#13;
defensible impact findings. This has resulted in poor quality impact assessments,&#13;
which have failed to confirm the poverty alleviation impact of the RSDP and&#13;
PSNP. These â&#128;&#156;knowledge market failuresâ&#128;&#157; (Gallouj, 1997) are a reoccurring fea-&#13;
ture of SSA road impact studies and need to be addressed if either ERA or PSNP&#13;
are to produce a â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; RCT impact evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
Impact evaluation expertise. There is considerable evidence of in-country exper-&#13;
tise in the application of econometric skills and statistical analysis in the evaluation&#13;
of road sector/RSDP impacts. Thus, the Ethiopian Development Research Institute&#13;
(EDRI) has undertaken a number of road sector related studies notably a review of&#13;
the impact of RSDP expenditure on GDP using time series secondary data from&#13;
Central Statistical Agency (CSA) and ERA. Econometric analysis of this data indi-&#13;
cates that the expansion of paved road has had a positive and statistically signifi-&#13;
cant impact on overall economic growth, but this is not the case for the gravel road&#13;
network. The study was unable to show a statistically significant relationship be-&#13;
tween the length of the gravel road network and the agricultural sectors contribu-&#13;
tion to overall GDP. It goes on to argue that more investment is needed to im-&#13;
prove rural accessibility but due to the lack of data, is unable to explore how the&#13;
expansion of the rural road network would improve productivity (Worku, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
A similar macroeconomic study conducted by both diaspora and in-country uni-&#13;
versity staff explores the relationship between road infrastructure and enterprise&#13;
development using time series secondary data from the CSA and ERA. The largely&#13;
urban and trunk road data was georeferenced to enable the team to develop GIS-&#13;
derived transport service proxy indicators rather than use capital expenditure or&#13;
road asset capital values (Shiferaw et al., 2012). The study identified that â&#128;&#156;the non-&#13;
random placement of roads across locations â&#128;¦.. makes identification of the impact of&#13;
road infrastructure quite difficultâ&#128;&#157; (p. 14). Nevertheless, by adopting panel GMM 7&#13;
estimators, the study was able to control for the endogeneity of road placement,&#13;

and show that improved road accessibility brought about by the RSDP increases â&#128;&#156;a&#13;
townâ&#128;&#153;s desirability for manufacturing firmsâ&#128;¦. This suggests that the public invest-&#13;
ment on roads is not only expanding the size of the manufacturing sector, it is improv-&#13;
ing the distribution of manufacturers across townsâ&#128;&#157; (p. 24, ibid).&#13;
&#13;
As yet, this expertise does not appear to have been applied to the analysis of rural&#13;
transportâ&#128;&#148;a missed opportunity by researchers and road stakeholders alike.&#13;
&#13;
Availability of secondary data. The Central Statistical Agency has a range of time&#13;
series data on topics that are of value to and may be incorporated into a rural&#13;
transport impact evaluation. These include:&#13;
&#13;
Household income, consumption and expenditure (HICE) or welfare monitoring&#13;
(WM) surveys. These surveys overlap to some extent insomuch as the HICE survey&#13;
tries to capture the income and expenditure dimension of poverty while WM sur-&#13;
veys provide socioeconomic data that reflects other dimensions of poverty (health,&#13;
education, nutrition, access to and utilization and satisfaction of basic facili-&#13;
ties/services and related non-income aspects of poverty). The HICE and WM sur-&#13;
veys have been conducted every four-five years since 1995/96. The latest is for&#13;
2010/11 and its findings have recently been published. They contain a number of&#13;
objectives, one of which being to provide basic data to enable the authorities to&#13;
design, monitor and evaluate the impact of socioeconomic policies and programs&#13;
on households/individuals living standard. From a rural transport point of view,&#13;
these surveys are a vital means of triangulating and strengthening the methodolog-&#13;
ical weaknesses that one-shot questionnaire surveys have in collecting income and&#13;
consumption data.&#13;
&#13;
Demographic and health surveys. These surveys were undertaken in 2000, 2005 and&#13;
2011 to collect national level data, used to calculate key demographic and family&#13;
health attributes including the utilization of health services, such as immunization&#13;
coverage among children, prevalence and treatment of diarrhea, other ailments&#13;
among children under age five, maternity care indicators, including antenatal vis-&#13;
its and assistance at delivery. This data has been used to benchmark Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
access to health services against other SSA counties (Walker and Vajjhala, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
These and other CSA surveys represent a source of secondary data that can be used&#13;
to both crosscheck findings and then generalize them across the country. It is un-&#13;
derstood that, if the right protocols are followed this data will be released as a data&#13;
set rather in the report format that appears on the CSA website.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RSDP MDG Monitoring Data. ERA has been funding the collection and analysis of&#13;
MDG and Road Sector indicator data, which largely revolve around the results or&#13;
performance of ERA. This data indicates that ERAâ&#128;&#153;s achievements are impressive&#13;
and its access and traffic/transport effects are noteworthy.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    The RAI, first measured in 1997 as 13%, is now 43% (2013) which re-&#13;
         flects a 231% increase in the road network.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    70% of the network is today in good condition compared to 22% in 1997.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Traffic has grown by 9% per year over this period.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Savings from reduced operating costs are estimated to be some 13% for&#13;
         the paved roads and 10% for the gravel road network (ERA, 2013).&#13;
&#13;
The methodological basis for the collection of these indicators is not clear but it&#13;
does represent an impressive set of time series data that once again can be used to&#13;
cross check and triangulate any findings.&#13;
&#13;
Morocco&#13;
National Commitment. The road sector has received substantial commitment&#13;
from the Government and the development partners over the last twenty years and&#13;
the construction of national and regional road network is largely completed. The&#13;
focus is now on the maintenance of this network and the extension of the rural&#13;
road network to (i) reduce provincial road network inequalities and (ii) increase&#13;
rural accessibility to motorable roads and their associated transport services.&#13;
&#13;
The MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Ã&#137;quipment, du Transport et de la Logistique (METL) is in the&#13;
final stages of implementing its DeuxiÃ¨me Programme National des Routes Rurales&#13;
(PNRR2) which aims to increase the access of some three million rural people to&#13;
economic and social services by building 15,560 kilometers of rural roads in all&#13;
sixteen regions of the country. At appraisal, some 650 million dollars were to be&#13;
invested in the sector, with some 62% of funds provided by loans from a wide&#13;
range of development partners including the World Bank, European Investment&#13;
Bank, Japanese Investment Cooperation Agency and Agence franÃ§aise de dÃ©-&#13;
veloppement. The Government of Morocco and the Caisse pour le Financement&#13;
Routier (CFR) provide a further 23% while local authorities fund the remaining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     55&#13;

&#13;
15%. The success of this Program can be judged by the increase in the National&#13;
Rural Road Accessibility Index 8 (NRRAI) from 54% in 2005 to 75% in 2012.&#13;
&#13;
The experience of PNRR2 also highlights a gap between the demand and supply of&#13;
transport services using the improved rural roads. A series of regional studies on&#13;
transport services was commissioned to explore the gap between supply and de-&#13;
mand as well as the operational, financial and logistical characteristics of the&#13;
transport service providers. The studies make recommendations on how these&#13;
services can be improved. These studies will inform the preparation and scope of&#13;
the next rural road program, giving it a stronger transport service focus.&#13;
&#13;
Existing and planned impact assessments. METL has commissioned a number of&#13;
impact studies since the publication of its first impact study in 1996. Currently,&#13;
METLâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;Direction des Routesâ&#128;&#157; has overseen an impact study of the PNRR2 which&#13;
has out sourced data analysis services to assess the impact of PNRR2 on six im-&#13;
proved and six control roads 9 (Conseil IngÃ©nierie et DÃ©veloppement, 2010). The&#13;
Centre National des Ã&#137;tudes et des Recherches RoutiÃ¨res (CNER) has also undertaken&#13;
in-house evaluations across the whole program, as and when resources allow&#13;
(CNER, 2011). In reality these studies are part of a project-based M&amp;E system es-&#13;
tablished by the â&#128;&#156;Direction des Routesâ&#128;&#157; (Road Department) at the start of the&#13;
PNRR2 to measure and report on the progress of works and its accessibility out-&#13;
comes or effects or results.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the Direction de la StratÃ©gie, des Programmes et de la Coordination des&#13;
Transports (DSPCT) under the METL is also undertaking a global project evalua-&#13;
tion of PNRR1 and PNRR2 to estimate long-term impacts, the results of which&#13;
will inform the preparation of a third Program. These studies use the same meth-&#13;
odology and are typical examples of results monitoring, and as such, fall short of&#13;
authoritative impact studies. Moreover, the indicators used focus on access to and&#13;
use of motorized vehicles and the impact hypotheses/logic behind some of some&#13;
indicators understates other dimensions of access 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8&#13;
  The NRRAI measures the percentage of population living in communities (douars) locat-&#13;
ed within one (1) kilometer of an all-weather road.&#13;
9&#13;
  CID claim that this impact study is more authoritative because its control roads closely&#13;
match the pre improvement conditions of the improved roads.&#13;
10&#13;
  For example, it is unclear how a motorable road will affect pupil enrolment, attendance&#13;
and attainment at primary schools, when the majority of pupils walk to school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                       Monitoring &amp; Evaluating Rural Transport Improvements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This approach to results monitoring builds on the methodology employed in&#13;
PNRR1. This involved the use of a cross-sectional sampling frame which was ap-&#13;
plied to project completed roads and parallel or unimproved roads or sections in&#13;
the same location. No baseline data was collected and â&#128;&#156;before improvementâ&#128;&#157; at-&#13;
tributes were identified either by retrospective questions or by the use of time se-&#13;
ries secondary data gathered from service providers (schools and health clinics at&#13;
the provincial or commune level). The difference between treatment and control&#13;
communes/households i.e. the â&#128;&#156;counterfactualâ&#128;&#157; is expressed in descriptive statis-&#13;
tics and this difference is assumed to represent â&#128;&#156;the benefitâ&#128;&#157; of road improvement.&#13;
&#13;
It is understood that the Government of Morocco, with the World Bank support&#13;
will be carrying out an impact evaluation of the National Initiative for Human&#13;
Development (INDH), which has constructed rural roads under a poverty targeted&#13;
community infrastructural improvement initiative. This impact evaluation will&#13;
compare changes in conditions in 62 INDH targeted rural communes with 61&#13;
communes that are nearly as poor but not covered by the national initiative. The&#13;
evaluation is designed to show (i) whether INDH has made a difference in house-&#13;
hold revenues and expenditures; (ii) changes in participation of households in&#13;
collective activities; (iii) use of and satisfaction with public services and infrastruc-&#13;
ture; and (iv) changes in nutrition, health or education status (World Bank, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
A baseline study was conducted in 2009 and the first follow-up survey of initial&#13;
outcomes in 2011. The findings of the results survey should be available now and&#13;
METL will be particularly interested in the third objective of the study.&#13;
&#13;
Other M&amp;E good practice. The ministry (METL) has developed an internet MIS&#13;
system (SYGER) that tracks and monitors the progress of inputs, outputs and oth-&#13;
er aspects of road asset management. Thus, new additions to the rural road net-&#13;
work are georeferenced in the field by GPS. These data are then transferred to the&#13;
GIS Unit in Rabat and the gazetted road network is updated and the road entered&#13;
into the maintenance management system.&#13;
&#13;
The HDM-IV vehicle operation costs (VOC) and road costs modules have been&#13;
calibrated to Moroccan conditions and these outputs now inform the Road Eco-&#13;
nomic Decision (RED) model which was used to select candidate roads for PNRR2&#13;
improvement.&#13;
&#13;
Road accident data is logged by the Gendarmerie royale, the Direction GÃ©nÃ©rale de&#13;
la SÃ©curitÃ© Nationale (DGSN) and METL provincial staff. METL established a re-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        57&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
porting system supported by prepaid Short Message Service (SMS) using the mo-&#13;
bile phone network with the CNER in Rabat. This incident log is followed by a site&#13;
visit and the completion of an accident report form, which is coded and entered&#13;
into a national road accident database. It is understood that the use of the mobile&#13;
phone network was introduced some six years ago and this has enhanced real time&#13;
reporting and management of road accident data.&#13;
&#13;
The same SMS is also used by provincial METL and administration staff to report&#13;
road events e.g. interruptions and emergencies affecting the passability of the net-&#13;
work. This has speeded up the emergency maintenance efforts of METL thereby&#13;
reducing the travel days lost to heavy rain or snow, flooding, landslides, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Impact evaluation budgets. The ministry undertook the impact study of the&#13;
PNRR2 in 2010 for an estimated total budget of $100,000. This budget includes&#13;
$50,000 for outsourced consultancy services to the Conseil IngÃ©nierie et DÃ©-&#13;
veloppement (CID) for data entry, cleaning and analysis of survey data with anoth-&#13;
er $50,000 of in-house/government resources for data collection. The latter has&#13;
been collected by in-house planning and economic staff in the regional (Services de&#13;
planification et des Ã©tudes Ã©conomiques) units of the METL. The staff is trained and&#13;
managed by the CNER and their capacity is such that the surveys were phased in&#13;
three stages across the country rather than executed at the same time.&#13;
&#13;
In contrast, the DSPCT Global impact study requires the consultants to collect&#13;
primary data from the field to test the achievement of project objectives and as a&#13;
result is reported to cost some $300,000.&#13;
&#13;
Impact evaluation expertise. There is limited social survey/econometric expertise&#13;
in METL. The CNER is largely focused on materials, pavement and other applied&#13;
engineering research and its staff is mainly qualified engineers with a range of en-&#13;
gineering skills and expertise. Similarly the regional staff are reported to be less&#13;
well qualified and since their function is to collect and collate regional and provin-&#13;
cial social and economic indicator data. The focus of both management levels is&#13;
the collection and use of predefined indicator data in order to assess the progress&#13;
and performance of the PNRR2 and there is some appetite to change the current&#13;
methodology so that it meets the demands of a gold standard RCT impact study.&#13;
That said, senior management is aware that the preparation of its next road im-&#13;

&#13;
provement program (PR3), scheduled to be launched in 2014, may require a more&#13;
sophisticated approach to impact monitoring 11.&#13;
&#13;
Availability of secondary data. As expected the Haut Commissariat au Plan (HCP),&#13;
Office of the High Commissioner for Planning, has undertaken a wide range of&#13;
statistical surveys on topics that may be of value to the results monitoring of the&#13;
METL and a potential Rural Transport Impact Evaluation. These are often broken&#13;
down by region and province; an initial review of these documents indicates some&#13;
of the more interesting sources of secondary data for the road sector.&#13;
2004 Census (Recensement gÃ©nÃ©ral de la population et de lâ&#128;&#153;habitat de 2004). The&#13;
2004 Census has been analyzed for each province and provides data on a wide&#13;
range of social and demographic characteristics for the whole country and is&#13;
scheduled to be repeated in 2014. Importantly, the 2004 Census included a ques-&#13;
tion on access to road infrastructure by the rural population and this is summa-&#13;
rized for Berrechid province below:&#13;

&#13;
The commentary notes that more than half of households (54.2%) live within&#13;
300 meters of a paved road and only 8.3% of rural households live some 8.1 Km&#13;
from a paved road. The census also notes the influence of distance on the size of an&#13;
household and the degree of illiteracy of its members. The causal links of this rela-&#13;
tionship are not explored but if the forthcoming 2014 Census repeats the question&#13;
then there is potential to explore these and other relationships by macro modeling&#13;
and produce subnational patterns of road sector social and possibly economic re-&#13;
lationships from the census. This would be a worthwhile addition to the SSA road&#13;
sector literature but funding would lie outside the scope of most project-based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11&#13;
 This reflects the need for PR3 to embrace an integrated approach to the delivery of com-&#13;
munity infrastructure in more economically and socially marginal communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     59&#13;

impact evaluations. Furthermore, the seven year time delay between the 2004 cen-&#13;
sus and the publication of these provincial reports implies that access to the data-&#13;
base will be required if this analysis is to be expedited quickly for policy and pro-&#13;
gramming purposes.&#13;
&#13;
National Survey on Standards of Living of Households (EnquÃªte nationale sur les ni-&#13;
veaux de vie des mÃ©nages). A national survey was undertaken in 1990/91, 1998/99,&#13;
2006/07 and uses a stratified random cluster survey to determine the overall socio-&#13;
economic situation and measure inequalities in the standards of living between&#13;
different social groups and regions of the country. It also provides a database on&#13;
the access of the population to basic social services. The reporting of the analysis of&#13;
the latest of these surveys is very condensed (HCP, 2007), but indicates that ex-&#13;
penditure on transportation and communications has increased by some 112%&#13;
and is now the third most important item of household expenditure. The report&#13;
indicates a relative decline in rural poverty and suggests that this will be investigat-&#13;
ed further in the form of an impact evaluation of the National Initiative for Hu-&#13;
man Development (INDH). Unfortunately, there appears to be no reference to&#13;
changes in access to social services.&#13;
The Implementation Completion and Results Report for the INDH indicate that&#13;
rural road investment has an IRR ranging from 17% to 50%. It was also noted that&#13;
there was a tendency to prioritize projects that brought services close to the rural&#13;
population. This overlooked the improvement of transport links as a means of&#13;
improving access to better equipped centers as a more cost effective solution&#13;
(p. 59, World Bank, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
National Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey (EnquÃªte nationale sur la&#13;
consommation et les dÃ©penses des mÃ©nages). These surveys determine household&#13;
expenditure and consumption patterns; they also provide the necessary data for&#13;
updating the inflation coefficients. They have been undertaken in 1959/60,&#13;
1970/71, 1984/85, 2000/2001 and are based on a random sample 15,000 house-&#13;
holds (8,520 urban and 6,480 rural households). A review of the publications using&#13;
these surveys suggest that they indicators collected by these surveys are asset and&#13;
utilization based and do not provide a time/distance access dimension to the use of&#13;
social services (Ezzrari, 2009). Nevertheless, such a report might be used by the&#13;
METL monitoring team to support or triangulate its findings.&#13;
&#13;
Other HCP Surveys and Publications. A review of the HCP website identifies other&#13;
access data and survey findings. Thus, a survey reporting on accessibility to health&#13;
services summarizes the time taken for patients to travel to health facilities (HCP,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2002). This type of data is important to support and triangulate METL results&#13;
monitoring findings.&#13;
&#13;
MDG monitoring data. The HCP reported that Morocco had reached its MDG&#13;
targets in 2009, some six years ahead of the 2015 deadline (HCP, 2010).&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
The METL has adopted a pragmatic approach to impact monitoring. It uses an&#13;
unsophisticated methodology to collect and collate PNRR2 outcome data (Study&#13;
Type 3 of Table 2-3. The absence of a baseline means that the comparability of the&#13;
controls is crucial to the identification and attribution road improvement benefits.&#13;
The researchers believe that these controls have been â&#128;&#156;wisely chosen to present the&#13;
maximum physical, demographic and economic similarities with the improved roadsâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
(p. 8, CID, 2010). Yet experience shows that the analysis will tend to over or under&#13;
estimate the benefits of the project roads due to inadvertent biases between project&#13;
and control roads. Thus, Table 7.3.2 of the CID Study shows wide variations in the&#13;
number of communities and populations served by the project and control roads.&#13;
It is likely that these variations alone will affect transport demand and levels of&#13;
traffic plying these roads.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, METL presents its evaluation findings as impacts but in reality they&#13;
are the outcomes or effects of project interventions (results monitoring) and are&#13;
best used on a case study or anecdotal basis. As such, they show a strong institu-&#13;
tional preference for traffic and transport data while the social and economic indi-&#13;
cator data is used to highlight the impacts of the earlier PNRR1 and PNRR2 pro-&#13;
jects fall short of the high standards required for a â&#128;&#156;gold standard RCT impact&#13;
assessmentâ&#128;&#157;. Nevertheless, METL seems willing to improve the methodology of&#13;
impact evaluation of rural roads within the PR3.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;3. Key Principles and Steps for Effective M&amp;E of RT Impacts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
There has been a gradual recognition among SSA governments and those involved&#13;
in implementing rural transport programs that the impacts of their efforts in the&#13;
subsector are not well documented. There is a lack of evidence on both the devel-&#13;
opment impacts of improvements and more importantly, the benefits they bring&#13;
to the rural poor. This knowledge gap is mainly due to methodological weaknesses&#13;
of existing SSA impact studies, e.g. Morocco 12, Ghana 13, and Liberia 14. This weak-&#13;
ness begins before the project starts when they fail to undertake baseline data collection&#13;
in both suitable control and treatment areas. (p. 47, Grootaert, C. 2002). It contin-&#13;
ues in the analysis of data, which assumes the autonomous nature of road impacts,&#13;
overlooking the importance of road access in the investment and planning deci-&#13;
sions made by other sectors, NGOs and entrepreneurs.&#13;
&#13;
Likewise, the traffic and transport focus of these studies has tended to gloss over&#13;
the fact that â&#128;&#156;the poor and very poor inhabit a localized, walking world, and as such&#13;
make little use of medium or long distance transport linksâ&#128;&#157; (p. 18, Hettige, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.2 Key principles&#13;
&#13;
Government/Sector interest in impact evaluations&#13;
Terminology. There is a multiplicity of terms and definitions used in the impact&#13;
literature and it is important that countries and development partners agree on a&#13;
standard set of definitions and terminology that are internationally acceptable. The&#13;

&amp;#12;Rural Transport in Africa â&#128;&#147; Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OECD-DAC definitions of impact seem the most widely used and appropriate in&#13;
this regard (2004).&#13;
&#13;
Commitment. There has to be a strong government and sector interest in the need&#13;
for and commitment to a rural transport impact evaluation. A number of factors&#13;
influence this commitment:&#13;
     ï&#130;§    A conducive policy environment is necessary. The findings of the evalua-&#13;
          tion are much more likely to be used if they address current policy con-&#13;
          cerns and implementation priorities.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    The evaluation should be launched when decision-makers have clearly&#13;
          defined information needs. The findings must be ready in time to affect&#13;
          decisions, and key results communicated informally before the final re-&#13;
          port is completed.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    An evaluation is one part of an information stream that influences policy&#13;
          makers and sector programs. The evaluation needs to reflect the context&#13;
          in which it will be used, the program being justified for poverty or road&#13;
          access reasons 15.&#13;
&#13;
Involvement. Similarly, the aid relationship as defined in the Paris Declaration and&#13;
other international agreements also has implications for rural transport impact&#13;
studies. There is now an onus on development partners to follow country systems&#13;
and strengthen capacity to carry out evaluations as part of normal administrative,&#13;
sector and governance functions asking â&#128;&#156;what works? and for whom?â&#128;&#157; This favors&#13;
the involvement of governments, country statistics offices and university staff in&#13;
joint evaluations and participatory approaches (Stern, 2012). This in turn requires&#13;
many SSA countries to re-examine their data access policies and work with devel-&#13;
opment partners to their mutual benefit (p. 42, World Bank, GDPRP, FAO. 2012).&#13;
&#13;
Bamberger endorses this approach and stresses the importance of actively involv-&#13;
ing national universities, think tanks and research institutions in the evaluation&#13;
process (2009). This approach has the added advantage of tapping into the aca-&#13;
demic networking of â&#128;&#156;research findingsâ&#128;&#157; through peer reviewed and conference&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15&#13;
   The former demands a process analysis of income/expenditure impacts by different so-&#13;
cio-economic groups the latter requires an emphasis on mobility and access by the different&#13;
socio-economic groups.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
papers, research fora and open access publication web sites, which widens the dis-&#13;
semination of findings beyond the immediate circle of interested parties.&#13;
&#13;
Execution of the evaluation. The evaluation may be carried out in many ways. The&#13;
more common ones are listed below, but before the decision is made, it might be&#13;
appropriate to undertake an initial diagnostic study to understand the context in&#13;
which the evaluations will be conducted. This work has already started this process&#13;
in Section 2.7 but further work is needed to assess the resources and capacity of the&#13;
likely organizations involved, the nature of the program(s) to be evaluated; the&#13;
kind of issues to be addressed; and the likely approaches that will be required&#13;
(Bamberger, 2009). A decision has also to be made as to how the services are to be&#13;
managed and procured, four possible approaches stand out:&#13;
  1.    The evaluation is conducted by the M&amp;E unit of the sector or subsector&#13;
        managing the project. This usually has the advantage of better access to&#13;
        the key stakeholders, secondary data along with a better understanding of&#13;
        the political and organizational context within which the evaluation is tak-&#13;
        ing place. However, sector M&amp;E is usually focused on progress and per-&#13;
        formance monitoring which has a strong engineering and contractual bias&#13;
        limited capacity in statistical/econometric techniques, which will need to&#13;
        be addressed by appropriate technical assistance and support. The evalua-&#13;
        tion will have difficulty maintaining its independence since the evaluation&#13;
        team is invariably affected by the politics of both the ministry and gov-&#13;
        ernment of the day and may find it difficult to explore sensitive areas.&#13;
&#13;
  2.    The evaluation is conducted by a national organization or body (CSO,&#13;
        university, research organization). In theory, this approach will still have&#13;
        access to key stakeholders, to secondary data, etc. but in reality, this may&#13;
        be hampered by the â&#128;&#156;siloâ&#128;&#157; thinking that characterizes most civil service or-&#13;
        ganizations. Nevertheless, the evaluation will be independent, will bring in&#13;
        experience from other sectors and databases and be able to explore sensi-&#13;
        tive issues such as local political pressures or the exclusion of vulnerable&#13;
        groups. However, capacity constraints due to the selective out-migration&#13;
        of the more able researchers and technical assistance might be needed to&#13;
        address this.&#13;
&#13;
  3.    Evaluation services with the appropriate mixture of national and interna-&#13;
        tional consultants are procured and managed by the sector. This is the&#13;
        more common approach to address the capacity and resource weaknesses&#13;
        of the earlier approaches but information asymmetry makes it difficult to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        65&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          manage the contract. Thus, technical assistance may be needed to prepare&#13;
          terms of reference and contract documents and evaluate the tenders as&#13;
          well as monitor performance and peer review the analysis and findings.&#13;
&#13;
     4.   The evaluation is led by the development partners supporting the sector&#13;
          who take full responsibility for the approach and findings. This approach&#13;
          is likely to produce the best product but limited involvement of stakehold-&#13;
          ers and partial knowledge transfer encourage dependency and a status quo.&#13;
&#13;
The best solution combines the advantages of all of the above approaches, while&#13;
minimizing the risks involved.&#13;
&#13;
Communication. An effective communication between the evaluation team and&#13;
the client in reporting the progress and findings of the evaluation is necessary. The&#13;
client should have confidence in the team. They in turn need to establish a good&#13;
relationship with the client and key stakeholders, understand their needs to avoid&#13;
surprises when the findings are reported. It is also important that results be pre-&#13;
sented in a user-friendly format.&#13;
&#13;
Scope of the evaluation. It is possible to ask a wide range of questions 16 in an im-&#13;
pact study and there is a wide range of quantitative and qualitative techniques that&#13;
can be used to answer these questions. This means that the client has to exercise&#13;
some discipline and make sure that the right questions are asked and Cli-&#13;
ent/Development Partners/Technical Assistance with the evaluation team resist the&#13;
temptation to widen or broaden the scope of the evaluation. Evaluations that col-&#13;
lect too much data analyzed in an unfocused way often fail to produce useful re-&#13;
sultsâ&#128;&#148;even when they are methodologically sound (Bamburger, 2004).&#13;
&#13;
Budget&#13;
The cost of impact studies is estimated to range from â&#128;&#156;$200,000 to $900,000 de-&#13;
pending on program size, complexity and data collectionâ&#128;&#157; (p. 23, Clark et al., 2004).&#13;
The largest and most expensive are the â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; RCT-based studies. Thus,&#13;
the survey and data entry costs of the Vietnam Impact study were budgeted at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16&#13;
   The fundamental questions asked are: 1. Is the intervention making a difference, achiev-&#13;
ing its goal? 2. What are the results on the ground, i.e. how is the intervention performing?&#13;
and 3. How can we do better, i.e. do we need to adjust the program and policy? More de-&#13;
tailed questions are associated with the preparation of the research tools.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                    Key Principles and Steps for Effective M&amp;E&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
US$85,000 in 1997 (Baker, 2000), this is equivalent to US$123,860 17 in current&#13;
terms. Three rounds of data were collected totaling some US$370,000 for overall&#13;
data collection costs. As a rule of thumb, analysis and reporting costs are at least&#13;
equivalent to those of data collection but for the complex analysis of â&#128;&#156;gold stand-&#13;
ardâ&#128;&#157; RCT surveys these rise to as much as twice those of data collection. This sug-&#13;
gests that a Vietnam-type study would cost upwards of US$1 million in todayâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
terms. Such a commitment is feasible only when there is a long-term commitment&#13;
to the road sector. Thus, Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s RSDP is in its fourth phase and some $10 bil-&#13;
lion has been disbursed over the past sixteen years (p.2, ERA, 2013). This has ena-&#13;
bled ERA to justify expenditure on several impact studies, which unfortunately&#13;
failed to deliver authoritative and defensible findings.&#13;
&#13;
Such expenditure exceeds the normal budgetary provision for M&amp;E in most fund-&#13;
ing agenciesâ&#128;&#148;ILO allows a minimum of 2% of total project funds to be set aside&#13;
for independent evaluations and 3% for reviews, monitoring and internal evalua-&#13;
tions (ILO, 2012). Special budget provision has to be prepared and its value as-&#13;
sessed, like any other project or program expenditure, in terms of its cost-&#13;
effectiveness or value for money. Most development partners funding rural&#13;
transport projects to date seem unconvinced that a RCT-based gold standard&#13;
study is cost effective and have focused on the well-trafficked road network where&#13;
outcome traffic-based impact studies can deliver acceptable rates of return.&#13;
&#13;
However, the poorly trafficked network and the incorporation of rural transport&#13;
investments into community-based poverty alleviation projects may encourage&#13;
one or more long-term impact evaluations in order to justify a policy stance that&#13;
favors the poverty reducing effectiveness of rural transport investments as well as&#13;
to quantify welfare benefits of access improvements (Bamberger et al., 2004).&#13;
&#13;
Elapsed time and timing of surveys&#13;
Impact studies have a minimum of two and possibly three stages in their execution&#13;
(Table 3-1). Each stage has its own characteristics and difficulties but all need to be&#13;
organized in the same way, with the same tools and seasonal timeframe. This sug-&#13;
gests that there should be a long-term relationship/partnership and trust between&#13;
the agency contracting the impact evaluation and those charged with carrying out&#13;
the work. In addition, Grootaert suggests that peak periods of economic activity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17&#13;
   Adjusted by the cumulative rate of CPI inflation in the USA (see website page on US In-&#13;
flation Calculator: www.usinflationcalculator.com).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           67&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(seeding, harvest time) are also avoided (2002). This strict adherence to the base-&#13;
line timetable is needed to â&#128;&#156;ensure that recall errors are held constant as much as&#13;
possible over successive survey roundsâ&#128;&#157; (p. 36, ibid).&#13;
&#13;
The first baseline or benchmark stage is the most critical in this regard. The mobi-&#13;
lization of fieldwork sets the timing of the study. The baseline also sets out the&#13;
impact methodology and the scale and direction of the data collection effort before&#13;
the rural transport project begins implementing the physical works. Invariably, the&#13;
project management is focused on planning and executing these works and the&#13;
danger is that the resource needs and importance of the baseline are neglected. The&#13;
project logical framework can be vital in this regard. If it sets explicit welfare goals&#13;
as well as traffic and access outcomes, management is obliged to recognize that the&#13;
projectâ&#128;&#153;s contribution to goal achievement may need to be addressed. Usually, this&#13;
involves a dialogue between project management, its funding agency and its coun-&#13;
terpart subsector ministry to decide the approach and resources needed to identify&#13;
and procure an appropriately qualified impact research team (see Section Execu-&#13;
tion of the evaluation above). If the record of successful impact studies is anything&#13;
to go by, this dialogue or resource constraints have favored short-term outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
The timetabling of the outcome surveys is usually in the last year of the project or&#13;
immediately after its completion. The purpose of the surveys is to assess the pro-&#13;
ject effectsâ&#128;&#148;by asking if the traffic and access objectives have been met and what&#13;
are the short-term changes to household and community access and welfare. A&#13;
positive finding at this stage is a precondition for the achievement of any welfare&#13;
goals that are the long-term impact.&#13;
&#13;
The final follow up survey is scheduled at least 5 years after the project completion&#13;
to capture all its welfare impacts with a concomitant emphasis on household and&#13;
community data (ADB, 2011). There is no agreement on the exact timing of this&#13;
stage as it relies on the emergence of behavioral and agricultural changes that re-&#13;
flect household investment decisions and demand adjustments (Kingombe, 2012).&#13;
However, the review of the impacts that have been applied (Table 3-1) suggests&#13;
that attrition, unforeseen shocks and spillover effects from other or parallel pro-&#13;
jects affect both the data sources and the integrity of the quasi experimental design&#13;
in the longer term IEs (Van De Walle et al. 2009).&#13;

 The adopted methodology is the outcome of a dialogue between project manage-&#13;
 ment, the funding agency and counterpart subsector ministry along with the&#13;
 budget constraints outlined in the previous section. This approach has favored the&#13;
 adoption of quantitative methodologies to evaluate projects by identifying&#13;
 transport cost savings enjoyed by road users. Thus, many project logical frame-&#13;
 works specified traffic or access changes as objectively verified indicators with a&#13;
 supplementary expectation that there will be a similar reduction in transport&#13;
 charges. Access indicators associated with attendance and use of markets, health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     69&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
centers, schools, etc. might be included as objectively verified indicators. These&#13;
performance or outcome indicators are easy to collect and analyze while project&#13;
management and the subsector ministry alike will readily understand the findings.&#13;
&#13;
This approach has worked where the road network is well trafficked, which is not&#13;
the case for an increasing number of rural transport projects. In this situation, the&#13;
proponents of quantitative techniques have argued that traffic-based evaluations&#13;
underestimate the real impact of a road. Wider impacts captured by household&#13;
and community surveys are needed to calculate the full treatment impacts of im-&#13;
provements. This inevitably leads to the â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; RCT approach in which&#13;
panel data for project and comparable control villages is used to capture changes&#13;
in household economic and social behavior before and after the road investment&#13;
(Khander et al., 2006). â&#128;&#156;This approach is especially suited to unpicking â&#128;&#152;causal pack-&#13;
agesâ&#128;&#153; â&#128;&#147; how causal factors combine and what might be the contribution of an interven-&#13;
tion. However such approaches are not good at estimating the quantity or extent of a&#13;
contributionâ&#128;&#157; (p. 81, Stern, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
To address this latter concern, the gold standard RCT methodology has incorpo-&#13;
rated a range of qualitative methods. These typically include key informant inter-&#13;
views and participatory rural assessments (PRA) and have either used them â&#128;&#156;se-&#13;
quentially, to inform the next phase or cumulatively to validate the dataâ&#128;&#157; (p. 3 Het-&#13;
tige, 2006). Thus, the Nicaraguan impact evaluation used qualitative impact as-&#13;
sessments at community, municipal and regional levels to test and inform the pre-&#13;
liminary findings of the econometric impact analysis (Goss Gilroy Inc. and Orbi-&#13;
con, 2010). Combining methods in this way helps compensate for the distribu-&#13;
tional weaknesses of quantitative methods but further increases the required re-&#13;
sources and skills of the impact team.&#13;
&#13;
This trend towards increasing resources and sophistication of impact evaluations&#13;
has been questioned by Woolcock, who stresses the importance of understanding a&#13;
known or likely impact trajectory over time of a project (2009). He argues that the&#13;
rural transport subsector has â&#128;&#156;a weak understanding of the shape of the impact tra-&#13;
jectories associated with its projects, and even less understanding of how these trajecto-&#13;
ries vary for different kinds of project operating in different contexts, at different scales&#13;
and with varying degrees of implementation effectivenessâ&#128;&#157;. Thus, the long-term im-&#13;
pact analysis of Khander and Koolwal (2011) and Van De Walle and Mu (2007)&#13;
both indicate that the positive trajectory of many of the impacts identified shortly&#13;
after project completion had declined over the longer term. They attributed this&#13;
decline to other unobserved processes like agglomeration, political patronage, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
distance from cities becoming important as road impacts are attenuated. These&#13;
processes do not act in a uniform manner; they encourage development and&#13;
growth in some communities and displaced them in others (Van De Walle , 2009).&#13;
Furthermore, Khanderâ&#128;&#153;s findings suggest that these benefits accrued to the better&#13;
off sections of society as the initial income gains of the poor were lost. Similarly,&#13;
Chen et al. concluded for the Southwest China Poverty Reduction Project â&#128;&#156;we&#13;
cannot reject the null hypothesis that the longer-term average impact [on poverty] was&#13;
in fact zeroâ&#128;&#157; (p. 30, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
It would seem that as impact studies engage with social systems, the linear and&#13;
causal relationships lying at the heart of the gold standard RCT approach no long-&#13;
er apply. â&#128;&#156;For example the empowerment of marginalized groups may lead to nega-&#13;
tive results before they become positive i.e. there will be a J-shaped curve. Or there may&#13;
be a step-function, where after a long period of no change there may be a dramatic&#13;
improvement e.g. when a new group is elected to power. Elsewhere, anti-corruption&#13;
efforts making use of public expenditure tracking surveys may have a high initial im-&#13;
pact that then fades over time (as those in power find alternative ways to misuse&#13;
funds)â&#128;&#157;. (p. 52, Stern, 2012)&#13;
&#13;
Institutional framework&#13;
Impact evaluations require an institutional commitment at national scale and not&#13;
just in the subsector. A national capacity also needs to understand the need for a&#13;
rigorous impact study and must be able to carry out it. This capacity includes both&#13;
the CSO, research organizations and the university sector. The financial and ca-&#13;
pacity needs of this commitment lie beyond the scope of most SSA countries and it&#13;
is expected that support from development partners will be needed.&#13;
&#13;
The commitment for impact findings to feed into government development policy&#13;
is as important as the methodology. Yet, a DFID-funded review of statistical ser-&#13;
vices observed â&#128;&#156;the availability of suitably qualified and trained staff was a universal&#13;
constraintâ&#128;&#157; affecting developing and developed country alike (p. ix, Strode, M. et&#13;
al., 2009). Similarly, an OECD study of member evaluation departments indicated&#13;
that significant resource constraints affected the evaluation departments of the&#13;
DAC 18 evaluation network. It was also reported that staff levels and the technical&#13;
evaluation skills (internal and outsourced) was a concern for more than half of its&#13;
reporting members (OECD, 2010).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Yet, preliminary discussions for the post-MDG development agenda have stressed&#13;
the need for a data revolution. Stronger monitoring and evaluation at all levels, and&#13;
in all processes of development (from planning to implementation) will help guide&#13;
decision-making, update priorities and ensure accountability (p. 3, UN, 2013). Clear-&#13;
ly, it will take some time before most SSA countries are able to conduct their own&#13;
impact evaluations. Given these institutional weaknesses, there is a need for the&#13;
pooling of technical expertise, experiences and research resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.3 Deciding on an impact evaluation&#13;
&#13;
The above principles suggest that most rural transport projects in SSA should&#13;
adopt a result-based impact assessment that focuses on the traffic and access im-&#13;
provements brought about immediately after project intervention.&#13;
&#13;
The most complex and expensive â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; RCT impact study should be&#13;
reserved for one or two SSA rural transport projects that satisfy most of the above&#13;
principles. This might be confirmed by the use of a diagnostic study following the&#13;
steps set out by Van de Valle in Table 3-2 below.&#13;
&#13;
Existing and planned impact evaluations&#13;
Assuming that Step 1 is in place, the diagnostic study should address Step 2 by&#13;
adopting a concentric approach. This would start by reviewing current projects&#13;
and how their logical framework objectives and goals are monitored. The formula-&#13;
tion of these frameworks will reflect the current context of improvements and&#13;
whether performance and impact are monitored in traffic terms or through the&#13;
more long-term indirect effects on agriculture/rural economy, health and educa-&#13;
tional services. In either case, a judgment can be made on the in-country capacity&#13;
to plan, execute and analyze impact studies.&#13;

&#13;
Table 3-2 Steps in the Evaluation of a Rural Transport Project (up to the Baseline)&#13;
&#13;
Step 1:    Deciding whether to implement an impact evaluation&#13;
Is there sufficient support and cooperation?&#13;
    ï&#131;¼ From the government&#13;
    ï&#131;¼ â&#128;¢ From the bank project team and bank management&#13;
    ï&#131;¼ â&#128;¢ From funding sources&#13;
Is a credible evaluation feasible?&#13;
    ï&#131;¼ Is there in-country capacity (data collection, supervision)?&#13;
    ï&#131;¼ Are there existing or planned surveys that can be used or questionnaires that can be adapted?&#13;
    ï&#131;¼ Is there a potential sampling frame in the prospective zone of influence?&#13;
    ï&#131;¼ Is there time to prepare and field a baseline before the project begins?&#13;
    ï&#131;¼ Can a counterfactual be identified under seemingly plausible assumptions?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 2:    Learn from the ex-ante evaluation&#13;
Understanding program placement: to understand biases in the ex-post evaluation and define an&#13;
appropriate counterfactual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 3:    Set up the evaluation team&#13;
Finding a stable in-country home for the evaluation.&#13;
   ï&#131;¼ Choosing an evaluation team that is reasonably independent of executing agency but can still&#13;
     work with that agency as need be: local counterpart, interviewers, data processors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 4:    The evaluation design: deciding what data are needed&#13;
Outcome variables (distributional impacts, traffic counts, time use, travel diaries)&#13;
Control variables (similar road length and function; community size, agro ecology,&#13;
Project data&#13;
Choice and definition of:&#13;
  ï&#131;¼ Zone of influence&#13;
  ï&#131;¼ Beneficiaries: communities, households, firms, individuals&#13;
   ï&#131;¼ Comparison areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 5:    The evaluation design: Collecting the data&#13;
Identify data sources and data collection methods&#13;
Sampling and sample size&#13;
Designing survey instruments&#13;
Deciding on timing of baseline and follow-up rounds&#13;
Step 6: Analysis and writing up&#13;
Plan adequate time for data processing: entry, cleaning, lessons for follow-up; analysis of baseline&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Commonly, the subsector outsources these services to national consultants who&#13;
may operate in other sectors and be able to bring this experience to the assign-&#13;
ment. Existing poverty reduction programs may have a monitoring unit and im-&#13;
pact agenda, which may welcome external support to strengthen the RAI 19 focus of&#13;
this research. The tools, sampling frames and counterfactual analysis 20 of this ex-&#13;
isting research may offer useful insights into national capacity for impact research.&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, the Country Statistical Office may also be undertaking national House-&#13;
hold or Budget Surveys and supporting the health sector surveys. These nationally&#13;
organized surveys may be repeated at regular intervals and thus provide time series&#13;
socioeconomic secondary data that might be useful to the impact analysis. It is&#13;
recommended that the questionnaires used for these national surveys are reviewed&#13;
and critical questions on household consumption and income sources, are repeat-&#13;
ed in the impact survey. This will enable the impact baseline to test its reliability in&#13;
these areas as well as generalize out from the project to the wider economy. Several&#13;
impact studies have also used this secondary data to reconstruct a baseline against&#13;
which project interventions can be assessed (Van De Walle , 2002, Lokshin, &amp;&#13;
Yemtsov, 2005 and Goss Gilroy Inc. &amp; Orbicon, 2010).&#13;
&#13;
It is also worthwhile exploring if these wider surveys use any subnational monitor-&#13;
ing resources. Chen et al.â&#128;&#153;s 2008 impact study used supervisors and trained field&#13;
assistants as part of the Rural Household Survey Team of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s National Bureau&#13;
of Statistics (NBS).&#13;
&#13;
This ex-ante exploration of subsector and national impact monitoring enables the&#13;
proposed impact evaluation to outline possible treatment outcomes and hypothe-&#13;
ses that interventions may stimulate and help define the counterfactual.&#13;
&#13;
Step 3: The evaluation team&#13;
The skills required by the impact evaluation team are associated with the design,&#13;
management, analysis and reporting of social science research, which involves&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19&#13;
   The need for consistent recognition of the RAI goal of living within 2 kilometres (20/25&#13;
minutesâ&#128;&#153; walk) of an all-weather road in other rural development sectors is important if&#13;
generalisations are to be inferred from different impact studies.&#13;
20&#13;
   Counterfactual analysis makes a comparison between what actually happened and what&#13;
would have happened in the absence of the intervention. This usually involves the statistical&#13;
analysis of propensity score matched treatment and non-treatment groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
wide ranging experience in the application of rural surveys. While the main thrust&#13;
of the research will be on quantitative data collection, the team should contain&#13;
qualitative research skills and integrate these into a management plan. The more&#13;
technical skills, namely econometric or statistical analysis are in short supply but&#13;
others involved in the operation and management of field surveys and the applica-&#13;
tion of qualitative techniques are more widely available. This mismatch is ad-&#13;
dressed in many of â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; RCT evaluations by the selective use of inter-&#13;
national expertise. Thus, Khander et al. were brought in to strengthen the original&#13;
BIDS impact study due to the use of bivariate analysis (a Difference-in-difference&#13;
technique) and did not control for endogeneity (Khander et al., 2006, 2011). In&#13;
Nicaragua, a joint venture between international and local consultants was pro-&#13;
cured to conduct the evaluation (2010). The former approach has the advantage of&#13;
using the known expertise of in-house World Bank staff, the latter needed external&#13;
expertise to assure quality to the procurement or selection process and help redress&#13;
the information asymmetry that affects the procurement process.&#13;
&#13;
Proposed impact evaluation methodology&#13;
Having decided the nature, composition and procurement strategy for the impact&#13;
evaluation team, steps 4, 5 and 6 (see Table Table 3-2) outline the design of the re-&#13;
search, its data collection tools and the analysis/write up of its results.&#13;
&#13;
The selection of impact data will reflect the impact questions asked. These will&#13;
range from the traffic and access variables needed to monitor project performance&#13;
to the welfare variables used to monitor long-term impacts.&#13;
&#13;
The sample or beneficiary units (communities, households, enterprises, individu-&#13;
als) will also need to be defined and once selected, variables included to enable&#13;
their disaggregation into different welfare groups.&#13;
&#13;
The definition of â&#128;&#156;controlâ&#128;&#157; parameters (roads of similar length and function,&#13;
zones of influence, community size, agro ecology) used to identify suitable com-&#13;
parison sites also occurs at this stage.&#13;
&#13;
The team will need to select, design and pre-test appropriate data collection tools.&#13;
It is recommended that a combined methodology in which qualitative PRA tech-&#13;
niques support the quantitative questionnaires and that these should be used in&#13;
parallel and sequentially to ensure integration and feedback of findings. This tri-&#13;
angulation of findings is needed to deconstruct the complex calculations of rela-&#13;
tionships that typify the quantitative techniques used in the â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; ap-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        75&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
proach. Many of these relationships are not visible to non-statistician and the&#13;
causal link may not be clear. Thus, the quantitative study of food crop marketing&#13;
in Sierra Leone found that crop prices fell after road improvement the reverse of&#13;
what positivist theory expected and qualitative research needed to be undertaken&#13;
to understand the causal linkages (Casaburi, 2013). Similarly, the Nicaraguan im-&#13;
pact evaluation used PRA techniques to test its Difference-in-difference findings&#13;
and only when they were confirmed by the beneficiaries were the causal links iden-&#13;
tified as significant.&#13;
&#13;
The sampling procedure and sample size will also need to be outlined. The base-&#13;
line sample in particular has to be large enough to compensate for the anticipated&#13;
attrition rates that affect panel surveys. It will also need to be statistically manipu-&#13;
lated to produce robust treatment and comparison groups. Typically, surveys en-&#13;
visage household samples in excess of one thousand for each of the treatment and&#13;
comparison groups.&#13;
&#13;
The timing and sequencing of resultant baseline survey sets the time and spatial&#13;
pattern for the planned follow-up surveys. Ideally, there should be two follow up&#13;
surveys, one immediately after project completion and the second at least five&#13;
years after. This extensive time period means that there has to be a long-term in-&#13;
stitutional and partnersâ&#128;&#153; commitment to an impact study that is capable of with-&#13;
standing subsector changes in management, staff and policy orientation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.4 Conclusion and recommendations&#13;
&#13;
Two main approaches to an impact evaluation are identified and endorsed in this&#13;
review of impact monitoring of rural transport projects.&#13;
&#13;
The first is results monitoring of project outcomes or effects that is widely applied&#13;
to rural transport projects across SSA. This type of impact evaluation is methodo-&#13;
logically sound if it stays focused on the direct traffic and transport benefits of a&#13;
project. In this way, it provides a subsector feedback on the success of its planning&#13;
and appraisal procedures and meets the accountability needs of financing agencies&#13;
and development partners. However, it has a number of weaknesses and mainly its&#13;
inability to assess the distribution of benefits in poverty terms. Here it is recom-&#13;
mended that PRA techniques in social mapping/modeling and wealth/well-being&#13;
ranking are explored as a means of answering the question of who benefits from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
rural transport interventions. There is also some merit in adopting and applying&#13;
Road User Satisfaction Surveys (See related Section above).&#13;
&#13;
The second is the panel survey of indirect household welfare benefits. This is called&#13;
the â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; Impact Evaluation which adopts complex statistical tech-&#13;
niques to control for heterogeneity and exogenous time varying factors in order to&#13;
establish a Randomized Control Trial (Van De Walle , 2009). Its heavy data de-&#13;
mands and resource intensive analysis limits its widespread adoption for the rea-&#13;
sons outlined in Section on Deciding on an impact evaluation above. Nevertheless,&#13;
it is recommended that it should be applied to at least one SSA country following&#13;
the Bangladesh approach (Khander et al., 2006, 2011) and focusing exclusively on&#13;
the rural transport sector where the unit of analysis is roads rather than communi-&#13;
ties. This is important since few of these studies continue the traffic and travel&#13;
analysis of results monitoring into the impact stage.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, both approaches have mainly relied on quantitative techniques with lim-&#13;
ited use of qualitative methods. Only the impact evaluation in Nicaragua demon-&#13;
strated the value of qualitative techniques as a quality assurance check on the va-&#13;
lidity of the statistical relationships generated by its analysis. The other panel sur-&#13;
veys rely on theory-based causation as their explanatory framework.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Causation without explanation is insufficient for policy learning because policy-&#13;
makers need to understand why as well as how if they are to use findings from re-&#13;
search or evaluation for future policy-makingâ&#128;&#157; (p. 10, Stern et al., 2012).&#13;

&#13;
Annex 1. Steps in propensity score matching&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The aim of matching is to find the closest comparison group from a sample of nonpartic-&#13;
ipants (non-road communities) to the sample of program participants (communities&#13;
with road). â&#128;&#156;Closestâ&#128;&#157; is measured in terms of observable characteristics. If there are only&#13;
one or two such characteristics then matching should be easy, but typically there are&#13;
many potential characteristics. The main steps in matching based on propensity scores&#13;
are as follows.&#13;
&#13;
Step 1&#13;
You need a representative sample of eligible nonparticipants as well as one for the par-&#13;
ticipants. The larger the sample of eligible nonparticipant communities the better, to&#13;
facilitate good matching&#13;
&#13;
Step 2&#13;
Pool the two samples and estimate a probit or logit model of participation in the road&#13;
project as a function of all variables in the data that are likely to determine participation.&#13;
&#13;
Step 3&#13;
Create the predicted values of the probability of participation from the estimated re-&#13;
gression; these are the propensity scores. There is a propensity score for every sampled&#13;
participant and nonparticipant community.&#13;
&#13;
Step 4&#13;
Some communities in the nonparticipant sample may have to be excluded at the outset&#13;
because they have a propensity score that is outside the range (typically too low) found&#13;
for the treatment sample. The range of propensity scores estimated for the treatment&#13;
group should correspond closely to that for the retained subsample of nonparticipants.&#13;
If the road program covers a very large area, for example, it may be national in scope, it&#13;
is quite likely that propensity scores may not match. In that case, improved matching&#13;
can be achieved by splitting the sample according to geographic location.&#13;
&#13;
Step 5&#13;
For each community in the treatment sample, find the observation in the nonparticipant&#13;
sample that has the closest propensity score, as measured by the absolute difference in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           79&#13;

&#13;
scores. This is called the â&#128;&#156;nearest neighbor.â&#128;&#157; You will get more precise estimates if you&#13;
use, say, the nearest five neighbors.&#13;
&#13;
Step 6&#13;
Calculate the mean value of the outcome indicator (or each of the indicators if there is&#13;
more than one) for the five nearest neighbors. The difference between that mean and&#13;
the actual value for the treatment observation is the estimate of the gain due to the&#13;
program for that observation.&#13;
&#13;
Step 7&#13;
Calculate the mean of these gains for each observation (community) to obtain the aver-&#13;
age overall gain. This can be stratified by some variable of interest, such as village size, in&#13;
the nonparticipant sample.&#13;

&amp;#12;Annex 2. Existing guidelines and standard documentation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There are a wide range of M&amp;E guidelines and standard documentation for develop-&#13;
ment projects including rural transport improvements. They tend to be unique to each&#13;
development agency, reflecting their need to plan and improve their development pro-&#13;
grams as well as demonstrate that development aid is well targeted and delivering tan-&#13;
gible benefits to the poor. Thus, bilateral agencies like the Department for International&#13;
Development (DfID) indicate that â&#128;&#156;high quality evaluations help us spend aid more effec-&#13;
tively so that more people are lifted out of poverty. Moreover, because evaluations are pub-&#13;
lished, they provide a direct line of accountability: to Parliament, the British public and our&#13;
partners in recipient countriesâ&#128;&#157;. (DfID website) Their evaluations are therefore designed to&#13;
assess the relevance, effectiveness and efficiency of the DfID programs.&#13;
&#13;
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) â&#128;&#147;Development&#13;
Assistance Committee (DAC) Criteria&#13;
&#13;
The 24 member countries and seven multilateral agencies who are members of the&#13;
OECD Evaluation Network tend to use the principles, glossary and criteria laid out in the&#13;
Principles for Evaluation of Development Assistance (OECD-DAC 1991), updated in the&#13;
Glossary of Terms in Evaluation and Results-Based Management (OECD-DAC 2004). This&#13;
defines impacts as â&#128;&#156;positive and negative, primary and secondary long-term effects pro-&#13;
duced by a development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintendedâ&#128;&#157; (p. 24,&#13;
2004). â&#128;&#156;The examination should be concerned with both intended and unintended results&#13;
and must also explain the positive and negative impact of external factors, such as changes&#13;
in basic policy environments, general economic and financial conditionsâ&#128;&#157; (p. 10, 1991).&#13;
&#13;
These and other definitions in the Glossary emphasize the differences between the&#13;
monitoring of project/program efficiency, effectiveness and impacts outlined in Figure&#13;
1-1 . This set of project-centered definitions draws heavily on the project Logical Frame-&#13;
work Matrix (LFM). The LFM in turn is the product of the project intervention logic and&#13;
both help frame the impact evaluation questions but they have their limitations 1. Never-&#13;
theless, the DAC guidelines set out the key impact questions that most of its members&#13;
apply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    The Logical Framework Matrix simplifies development to a cause-and-effect process in which&#13;
resource inputs create physical outputs, which in turn trigger a series of predicted outcomes that&#13;
over time accumulate into a development impact.&#13;

        ï&#130;§    What has happened as a result of the program or project?&#13;
        ï&#130;§    What real difference has the activity made to the beneficiaries?&#13;
        ï&#130;§    How many people have been affected?&#13;
&#13;
The OECD-DAC documents have laid the foundation for the impact evaluation activities&#13;
of its members over the past twenty years. A recent review of their evaluation activities&#13;
indicates that an increasing number (58%) undertook impact evaluations. In doing so,&#13;
many members needed to set out their own guidelines to support impact studies as well&#13;
as identifying skill shortages among staff and consultants to increase the focus and rigor&#13;
of the resultant reports. This study also noted that cross-cutting issues, such as gender&#13;
and the environment, were now routinely mainstreamed across all evaluations by a&#13;
number of agencies (OECD 2010).&#13;
&#13;
Guidelines produced by the DAC Evaluation Network Members&#13;
&#13;
Generic guidelines have been developed by most DAC members undertaking impact&#13;
studies. These range from generalized approaches as typified by IFAD, to the more de-&#13;
tailed approach by the European Union to the more subsector/institution specific guide-&#13;
lines produced for Nepal by ADB funded technical assistance. These different types of&#13;
guidelines are described below:&#13;
&#13;
     IFAD&#13;
&#13;
The IFAD approach to evaluation draws on the above OECD/DAC Glossary to define the&#13;
impact of its programs as â&#128;&#156;the changes that have occurred or are expected to occur in the&#13;
lives of the rural poor (whether positive or negative, direct or indirect, intended or unintend-&#13;
ed) as a result of development interventionsâ&#128;&#157; (p. 10, IFAD 2010). The Evaluation Manual is&#13;
generic in its approach setting out the fundamentals of the different impact methodol-&#13;
ogies (Chapter 2) that might be used and demonstrating how these might be applied to&#13;
specific projects (Chapter 3) and country programs (Chapter 4).&#13;
&#13;
     European Commission&#13;
&#13;
The European Commission has produced an Evaluation Guideline in four volumes: This&#13;
first volume outlines basic concepts and methodologies. The second focuses on evaluat-&#13;
ing country programs, while the third concerns specific projects such as transport. The&#13;
fourth volume presents the common Evaluation Tools. The documents go on to identify&#13;
the main .evaluation criteria&#13;

&amp;#12;                                         Annex 2. Existing Guidelines and Standard Documentation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Relevance: the extent to which the objectives of the development intervention are&#13;
consistent with beneficiariesâ&#128;&#153; requirements, country needs, global priorities and part-&#13;
nersâ&#128;&#153; and ECâ&#128;&#153;s policies.&#13;
&#13;
Effectiveness: the extent to which the development interventionâ&#128;&#153;s objectives were&#13;
achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance.&#13;
&#13;
Efficiency: the extent to which the outputs and/or desired effects have been achieved&#13;
with the lowest possible use of resources/inputs (funds, expertise, time, administrative&#13;
costs, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability: the extent to which the benefits from the development intervention&#13;
continue after termination of the external intervention, or the probability that they con-&#13;
tinue in the long-term in a way that is resilient to risks.&#13;
&#13;
Impact: identify positive and negative, primary and secondary long-term effects pro-&#13;
duced by a development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended.&#13;
&#13;
Coherence: the extent to which activities undertaken (a) allow the European Commis-&#13;
sion to achieve its development policy objectives without internal contradiction or&#13;
without contradiction with other Community policies and (b) complement partner&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s policies and other donorsâ&#128;&#153; interventions.&#13;
&#13;
Community value added: the extent to which the project/program adds benefits to&#13;
what would have resulted from Member Statesâ&#128;&#153; interventions in the same context.&#13;
&#13;
Four analytical procedures are identified for impact studies:&#13;
&#13;
        ï&#130;§       Change analysis, which compare indicators over time and/or against targets;&#13;
&#13;
        ï&#130;§       Meta-analysis, which extrapolates upon findings of other evaluations and&#13;
                studies, after having carefully checked their validity and transferability;&#13;
&#13;
        ï&#130;§       Attribution analysis, which compares the observed changes with a â&#128;&#156;policy-&#13;
                offâ&#128;&#157; scenario, also called counterfactual;&#13;
&#13;
        ï&#130;§       Contribution analysis, which confirms or disconfirms cause-and-effect as-&#13;
                sumptions on the basis of a chain of reasoning.&#13;
&#13;
The first analytical procedure is the lightest one and may fit virtually all questions posed&#13;
by the above criteria. The three last procedures are better at answering cause-and-effect&#13;
questions that mainly arise from the last three criteria (EC, Volume 3, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
There appears to be no specific impact evaluation guidelines for rural transport but a list&#13;
of generic transport sector indicators has been identified by the Evaluation Unit, and&#13;
these are adopted and appropriately used on a country specific basis where transport&#13;
forms part of the Country Strategy or National Indicative Program (EU, 2009).&#13;

     Asian Development Bank: Interim Guidelines for Enhancing Poverty Reduction Impact of&#13;
     Road Projects in Nepal&#13;
&#13;
These guidelines are the output of the capacity building efforts of the ADB in Nepal.&#13;
They were developed to strengthen existing methods and procedures used by the De-&#13;
partment of Roads (DOR) in Nepal and to introduce its management and M&amp;E staff to&#13;
basic poverty concepts, their measurement and the impact of the road sector on pov-&#13;
erty. The guidelines fall into two parts. The first part sets the national and sector context&#13;
in terms of the Government of Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s poverty reduction policies and its interaction with&#13;
road improvement. The second contains detailed guides, and procedures to be followed&#13;
if the DOR is to enhance the poverty reduction impact of road projects. These are fol-&#13;
lowed by a number of annexes that give specific examples of steps, samples and strate-&#13;
gies that be applied. These include:&#13;
&#13;
        ï&#130;§    A Decision Flow Chart on the Potential Use of Labor-Based Approaches&#13;

&#13;
     World Bank: Guidelines&#13;
&#13;
There are a number of M&amp;E guidelines emanating from a number of sources in the&#13;
World Bank. These range from detailed descriptions of the â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; RCT tech-&#13;
nique to more pragmatic discussions about monitoring under resourced SSA. One of the&#13;
most recent of these is from a cooperative effort with FAO entitled â&#128;&#156;On the tracking re-&#13;
sults in agriculture and rural development in less-than-ideal conditions â&#128;&#147; A sourcebook&#13;
for monitoring and evaluationâ&#128;&#157;. The less than ideal conditions it refers to are associated&#13;
with monitoring results (outcomes and impact) in many rural areas. It recognizes that&#13;
â&#128;&#156;gold standardâ&#128;&#157; RCT impacts are invariably data-hungry requiring statistical and econo-&#13;
metric skills that are in short supply among project and government development pro-&#13;
fessionals alike. The authors therefore advocate the adoption of a service delivery ap-&#13;
proach, which emphasizes three project outcomes. For a rural road project these out-&#13;
comes are&#13;
&#13;
        a.   the percentage of the target population having access to transport services&#13;
             on the new road i.e. the RAI definition of within two kilometers;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         b.   the percentage of the target population using transport services over a fixed&#13;
              period of time e.g. the last week, and&#13;
&#13;
         c.   the percentage of users satisfied with the condition of the new road possi-&#13;
              bly in affordability, speed or comfort terms.&#13;
&#13;
A variation of this service delivery approach has been developed for a community infra-&#13;
structure improvement program in Nigeria.&#13;
&#13;
Rural transport Guidelines produced by other development agencies&#13;
&#13;
   ILO&#13;
&#13;
Current views of evaluation by ILO mirror those outlined above. ILOâ&#128;&#153;s Results-Based&#13;
Management (RBM) Guidebook (2012) defines the evaluation process as â&#128;&#156;a distinct, es-&#13;
sential and complementary function to performance measurement and RBMâ&#128;&#157; (p. 4). The&#13;
latter is in effect a type of performance monitoring used to assess whether results or&#13;
outcomes have been achieved.&#13;
&#13;
In contrast, evaluations are used to inquire about why and how results were achieved.&#13;
The evaluation function provides information not readily available from performance&#13;
monitoring systems, in particular in-depth consideration of attribution, relevance, effec-&#13;
tiveness and sustainability. ILO also stresses the importance of an independent judg-&#13;
ment on the functioning of its performance system and recommending appropriate&#13;
management action (ILO 2012). Evaluations are mainly designed to promote organiza-&#13;
tional learning by highlighting useful lessons that can be applied elsewhere to improve&#13;
program or project performance, outcome, or impact (ILO, 2013). They also serve ac-&#13;
countability purposes by feeding these lessons into the decision-making process of&#13;
stakeholders, including donors and national partners. The resultant evaluations are es-&#13;
sential short-term effect studies rather than long term impactsâ&#128;&#148;evaluations of the Nias&#13;
Islands Rural Access and Capacity Building Project, Quick Impact Employment Creation&#13;
Project (QIECP) for Youth through labor-based Public Works in Sierra Leone (ILO Evalua-&#13;
tion Unit, 2012). They have the advantage of rapid management feedback of results but&#13;
lack methodological rigor in the collection and use of impact data.&#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, ILO has produced several notable guidelines that have some application in&#13;
rural transport impact assessments. The first is Murphyâ&#128;&#153;s elaboration of rapid survey&#13;
methods to assess the poverty reduction impacts of pilot employment-intensive pro-&#13;
jects (1998). The document details the methods, tools and procedures to undertake a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           85&#13;
&amp;#12;Rural Transport in Africa â&#128;&#147; Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Rapid Assessment of Poverty Impacts (RAPI) of rural road project. It sets out four steps in&#13;
the process:&#13;
&#13;
     (1) definition of the (geographically bounded) study area and separate control site&#13;
&#13;
     (2) use of rapid, but rigorous, methods of random sampling&#13;
&#13;
     (3) household-level analysis&#13;
&#13;
     (4) use of five classes of simple poverty indicators, eschewing income or expendi-&#13;
     ture measures&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, these guidelines are rather old and do not take into account the current&#13;
preference for more statistically rigorous Randomized Control Trials (RCTs).&#13;
&#13;
In summary, the current ILO approach to evaluation focuses on the results of an inter-&#13;
vention, identifying what worked, what didnâ&#128;&#153;t work, and why this was the case. It is de-&#13;
fined as â&#128;&#156;an evidence-based assessment of strategy, policy or program and project out-&#13;
comes, by determining their relevance, impact, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. An&#13;
evaluation should provide information that is credible and useful, enabling the incorpora-&#13;
tion of lessons learned into the decision-making process of both recipients and donorsâ&#128;&#157; (p. 4,&#13;
ILO Policy Guidelines, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
     MCC&#13;
&#13;
The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) see independent impact evaluations as&#13;
fundamental to its core mission since they help answer three fundamental questions:&#13;
&#13;
        ï&#130;§      Was the investment implemented according to plan? (This is the key to&#13;
               transparency).&#13;
        ï&#130;§      What are the changes in income for program participants that are attributa-&#13;
               ble to MCCâ&#128;&#153;s investment? This is key to accountability.&#13;
        ï&#130;§      Why did or didnâ&#128;&#153;t the planned investments lead to changes in income? This&#13;
               is key to learning.&#13;
&#13;
MCC argue that impact evaluations are the most rigorous form of evaluations for they&#13;
make it possible to know whether the observed impacts were caused specifically by an&#13;
intervention or, alternatively, are the result of external factors that affected program&#13;
participants and non-participants alike. They do this by comparing what happened with&#13;
the intervention to what would have happened without it i.e. through the use of a coun-&#13;
terfactual. However, MCCâ&#128;&#153;s evaluation factsheet indicates that tracking results and being&#13;
able to use them for future transport planning, and to understand what works and what&#13;
does not work is still a challenge in SSA (2012).&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Annex 5. Glossary of impact evaluation terms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation in New Delhi, India publishes an open&#13;
source glossary of impact evaluation terms. Some of the more important definitions&#13;
from this glossary are given below:&#13;
&#13;
Attrition&#13;
&#13;
Attrition refers to either the number and % of participants who have dropped out from&#13;
the treatment group during the intervention, or a failure to collect data from a unit in&#13;
subsequent rounds of a panel data survey. Either form of attrition can result in biased&#13;
impact estimates.&#13;
&#13;
Baseline survey and baseline data&#13;
&#13;
A survey to collect data prior to the start of the intervention. Baseline data are necessary&#13;
to conduct double difference analysis, and should be collected from both treatment and&#13;
comparison groups.&#13;
&#13;
Comparison Group&#13;
&#13;
A group of individuals whose characteristics are similar to those of the treatment groups&#13;
(or participants) but who do not receive the intervention. Under trial conditions in which&#13;
the evaluator can ensure that no confounding factors affect the comparison group it is&#13;
called a control group.&#13;
&#13;
Counterfactual&#13;
&#13;
The state of the world in the absence of the intervention. For most impact evaluations&#13;
the counterfactual is the value of the outcome for the treatment group in the absence of&#13;
the intervention. However, studies should also pay attention to unintended outcomes,&#13;
including effects on non-beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
Double difference&#13;
&#13;
The difference in the change in the outcome observed in the treatment group com-&#13;
pared to the change observed in the comparison group; or, equivalently, the change in&#13;
the difference in the outcome between treatment and comparison. Double differencing&#13;
removes selection bias resulting from time-invariant unobservables. Also called Differ-&#13;
ence-in-difference. Compare to single difference and triple difference.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         93&#13;
&amp;#12;Rural Transport in Africa â&#128;&#147; Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Impact heterogeneity&#13;
&#13;
The variation in impact as a result of differences in context, beneficiary characteristic or&#13;
implementation of the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
Matching&#13;
&#13;
A method utilized to create comparison groups, in which groups or individuals are&#13;
matched to those in the treatment group based on characteristics felt to be relevant to&#13;
the outcome(s) of the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
Panel data and panel survey&#13;
&#13;
Data collected through consecutive surveys in which observations are collected on the&#13;
same sample of respondents in each round. Panel data may suffer from attrition, which&#13;
can result in bias.&#13;
&#13;
Propensity Score Matching (PSM)&#13;
&#13;
A quasi-experimental design for estimating the impact of an intervention. The outcomes&#13;
for the treatment group are compared to those for a comparison group, where the latter&#13;
is constructed through matching based on propensity scores. The propensity score is&#13;
the probability of participating in the intervention, as given by a probit regression on&#13;
observed characteristics. These characteristics must not be affected by the intervention.&#13;
PSM hence allows matching on multiple characteristics, by summarizing these charac-&#13;
teristics in a single figure (the propensity score).&#13;
&#13;
Quasi-Experimental Design&#13;
&#13;
Impact evaluation designs used to determine impact in the absence of a control group&#13;
from an experimental design. Many quasi-experimental methods, e.g. propensity score&#13;
matching and regression discontinuity design, create a comparison group using statisti-&#13;
cal procedures. The intention is to ensure that the characteristics of the treatment and&#13;
comparison groups are identical in all respects, other than the intervention, as would be&#13;
the case from an experimental design. Other, regression-based approaches, have an&#13;
implicit counterfactual, controlling for selection bias and other confounding factors&#13;
through statistical procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)&#13;
&#13;
An impact evaluation design in which random assignment has been used to allocate the&#13;
intervention amongst members of the eligible population. Since there should be no&#13;
correlation between participant characteristics and the outcome, and differences in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
94&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Annex 5. Glossary of Impact Evaluation Terms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
outcome between the treatment and control can be fully attributed to the intervention,&#13;
i.e. there is no selection bias. However, RCTs may be subject to several types of bias and&#13;
so need follow strict protocols. Also called Experimental design.&#13;
&#13;
Sampling frame&#13;
&#13;
The complete list of the population of interest in the study. This is not necessarily the&#13;
complete population of the country or area being studied, but is restricted to the eligi-&#13;
ble population, e.g. families with children under five, or female â&#128;&#147;headed households. For&#13;
a facility survey, the sampling frame would be all facilities in the area of study. If a recent&#13;
sampling frame is not available then one needs to be constructed through a field-based&#13;
listing.&#13;
&#13;
Spillover effects&#13;
&#13;
When the intervention has an impact (either positive or negative) on units not in the&#13;
treatment group. Ignoring spillover effects results in a biased impact estimate. If there&#13;
are spillover effects then the group of beneficiaries is larger than the group of partici-&#13;
pants. When the spillover affects members of the comparison group, this is a special&#13;
case of contagion.&#13;
&#13;
Unobservables&#13;
&#13;
Characteristics which cannot be observed or measured. The presence of unobservables&#13;
can cause selection bias in quasi-experimental designs, if these unobservables are corre-&#13;
lated with both participation in the programme and the outcome(s) of interest.&#13;

            Good policies and practices on rural
            transport in Africa : monitoring and evaluation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This publication is part of a series
            aimed at promoting good policies and practices on rural
            transport in Africa. A recent review of the status of Rural
            Transport Knowledge Products and Practice (Riverson, 2012)
            identified a number of knowledge gaps and recommended the
            production of working papers to address these. One of these
            gaps was the absence of robust tools, including relevant
            indicators and instruments, to measure the impact of rural
            transport projects on rural growth and poverty reduction.
            This paper addresses this gap. The focus on impact
            monitoring appears relatively straightforward but in reality
            requires a distinction between effects and impact, terms
            used interchangeably in the literature. Similarly, there is
            a range of technical terms and definitions applied to
            Monitoring and Evaluation, presented in annex four. A
            monitoring and evaluation system is an essential element of
            planning, design and implementation of a rural transport
            project1 as it serves to assess whether it has achieved its
            objective and its development goal. Thus, the Millennium
            Challenge Corporation (MCC) sees independent evaluations as
            the most rigorous means of measuring [program] impact and
            [is] at the heart of MCC&#146;s commitment to accountability,
            learning, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
            Yet, there are few completed independent evaluations on the
            MCC website and the majority of their evaluation effort
            seems focused on performance monitoring. Similarly, the
            Indian Government&#146;s results-based management of its large
            agricultural support program separates outcomes from impact
            and stresses the importance of the former as a means of
            assessing the performance of government departments such as
            public works and transport in supporting the government&#146;s
            ambitious agricultural development program (Government of
            Kerala Memo, 2013).
